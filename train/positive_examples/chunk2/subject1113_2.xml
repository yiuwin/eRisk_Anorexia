	<TEXT> Don't you think that maybe a man won't go through all that trouble to prev on people? There is literally nothing stopping a man from walking into a woman's bathroom and doing anything, do you think a law is going to stop him?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was assigned female at birth. A lot of the time people do give me shit because I'm too 'tumblr' for them but I know a lot of other non binary people so that's cool. Having autism can kind of turn people off because I don't really understand social cues and I'm not as socially aware as other people my age, so that caused a lot of isolation and bullying when I was in secondary/high school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I study theatre in college and the plays that are on my course are okay but I prefer something that will creep me out or something spooky. I especially love creepy dolls, yandere type characters and gore. </TEXT>
