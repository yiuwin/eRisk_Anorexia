	<TEXT> I was pretty chubby in high school but I loved playing hockey and I was trying out for the team. I was grabbing a water bottle inbetween matches and overheard my coach and one of the girls on the team having a conversation. My coach looked over at me then muttered;

"It's a shame. If she wasn't so BIG I'd consider her for the team."

I remember feeling so ashamed! I developed anorexia after highschool, but thankfully I'm at a healthy weight nowadays and I play for a great team </TEXT>
