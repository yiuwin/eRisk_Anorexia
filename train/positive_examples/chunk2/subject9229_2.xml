	<DATE> 2016-08-06 20:58:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> * **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
\$1500 USA


* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 No 2 in 1, battery life isn't a huge deal (it will be plugged in most of the time), want the best specs I can get otherwise


* **How important is weight to you?**
 Weight doesn't matter. 


* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**

 Doesn't matter too much. I have no experience with Linux though, I'd like a device with OSX, although its not a requirement

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
As large as possible


* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
 I am going to be an engineering major, so possibly CAD and stuff like that. Light photoshop/photo editing. Would also like to be able to game on it as a secondary purpose. 


* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
As best as possible within my budget. I have a gaming desktop already (i7 4790k, R9 290, 16gb DDR3), so I'd like to be able too keep similar or better performance if possible. Like I said though, gaming is 100% a secondary purpose.


* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 A decent keyboard would be nice (do any laptops have mechs? Apple keyboards are nice), excellent build quality is a must. Touch screen would be nice, but not necessary. Not necessarily a requirement, but I would prefer a dedicated GPU. i7 would be nice for the hyperthreading since I will be doing CAD and design work. 


* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 I had my eye on a Macbook Pro, but the lack of a dedicated GPU turned me off to the idea a little. The XPS 15 also looks very good, but I'm not sold on it. I just thought I'd post to see if I could get any other recommendations or input on the MBP vs XPS 15. I am leaning toward a macbook, but one with an i7 is a bit out of my budget. Is it worth it for the i5 still?

	<TEXT> I've been looking at a '95 YJ 4banger. I test drove it last night and it runs and drove great, no leaks, rust or any issues I could find. 130k miles. It comes with a extra oem hard top, full doors, half doors, soft top, a set of vinyl seats, two sound bars, has a half hard top on it currently. I checked it over pretty thouroughly and couldn't find anything wrong at all, I'm just wondering if there is anything common I should look for?  The owner is asking $5k, which is a fair price and is a few hundred below KBB value. I'm tempted to offer him $5k but I want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything first. Any suggestion?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> First Bike Purchase - CX500 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-25 18:46:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A guy contacted me about a trade offer for my 1985 Ford Ranger. Unfortunately for him, I had already sold the Ranger. He offered to trade a 1980 Honda CX500 for it. After I told him that I had already sold the truck, he offered to sell me the bike for $650. The bike has 23k miles and runs good according to the owner. He put Harley mufflers on it though, which may or may not be concerning. I know almost nothing about bikes, but $650 for a running bike doesn't sound like a bad deal to me. Should I do it?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I just test drove and inspected a 1997 Dakota SLT 2WD with the V6 Magnum and auto transmission. 101k miles, drives fine, no leaks or issues. Everything (minus brakes) works as it should. It needs new tires as well as brake pads and rotors. The bed is completely rusted out and there is rust on the front fenders. The frame and floor are rust free (some surface rust only) The owner was asking $1800 but agreed on $1600. Is it worth it at this price? I really like the vehicle and it seems to be in good condition other than the rust (I already have a new bed sourced as well as new fenders to fix the rust issues. = $300 for bed and $75 for the fenders), and its going to be mainly a winter beater anyways. Is there anything that is common that I should look for before I buy?

	<TITLE> I [18M] want to stay friend with my ex [17F], who I dated for five months. She wants to stay friends with me too. We've known each other for three years </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-08 23:44:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I met this girl my sophomore year of high school and it was pretty obvious that we both liked each other. Neither of us acted on it and I didn't ask her out until my senior year two and a half years later, although me and her still occasionally talked and stuff. We dated for five months and went to Sadies and Prom together and we both were happy and went on dates and all that. About a month and a half ago she told me that she wanted to break up but still wanted to be friends. Her stated reason was that she didn't feel the same way about me anymore. It wasn't exactly a shock to me, since me and her were having issues related to her feelings towards me the last few weeks of our relationship, but I was still completely devastated. I was in a pretty dark place the past month or so, and cut off contact with her, except for once when I texted her asking her if she was sure she wanted to break up (about two weeks after the breakup). That is until today.

Today she stopped by my house to drop off my sweatshirts and stuff she had of mine, and I asked her if she still wanted to be friends and she said, of course. I've been texting her and I really want to remain friends with her. She still wants to be friends with me as well. I hear all the time that this is a bad idea, but I'm friends with a lot of her friends, so I'll inevitably see her and do stuff with her and our mutual friends anyways. I'll admit that I love her still, but at this point I'm mostly accepted that I'll never be with her as I was before. I guess my reasoning is that if I can't be her boyfriend, I can at least be her friend. She is an amazing person and I still want her in my life.

I guess I just want to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or whatever? Am I making a mistake? I know it will hurt every time I see her, but I'm willing to deal with that. I've already been dating around a little since we broke up, and I know that I have no chance with her again (although I still admittedly have a small sliver of hope that I will someday). We both want each other in our lives, but I don't know if its the right decision.


   
**tl;dr**: My GF of 5 months broke up with me, I still love her, she doesn't love me, but we both want to be friends still because we still like each other as friends.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So my ex broke up with me a little less than a month ago. I've loved her for over 3 years but only dated her for 5 months. This Saturday will mark a month since our breakup. I literally lost everything during the breakup. I lost nearly every single friend (since they were mutual friends and chose her over me.) Her best friend [16/F] decided to be friends with both of us. About a week ago she lied to me about my ex and gave me tons of lies about why my ex broke up with me because she was trying to get me to go out with her.  (During our breakup my ex never gave me a reason.) She just  said she wanted to break up and walked away. Every single night since then, I've more or less cried myself to sleep. I love this girl more than anything in the world. We were friends for years and now we are nothing. I had nothing to lose, so today I asked my ex if there was any chance of a second try. She told me she didn't love me, and that there was no chance which I expected but hurt more than anything I've ever felt regardless. (This happened less than 15 minutes ago) I don't know how to move on. I think I've  slipped back into depression since the breakup and I have no idea how to move on. I love my ex more than anything in the world and she doesn't love me.  I've never felt so upsey. I've also lost pretty much everything. How do I move on? I can't...

Tl;Dr: girlfriend broke up with me a month ago. I am destroyed. I had nothing to lose so I asked her if there was a chance for a second try. She told me no and that she doesn't love me. I cant move on. How do I move on? Please... </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-06-23 16:43:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So me and my girlfriend were hanging out at my house yesterday just watching Netflix and stuff and our conversation turned to sex. She knows that I want to have sex, but she doesn't want to, which is fine with me at this point in our relationship, since it is still kinda early.  

What is bothering me is what she kept joking about sex and just kinda teasing it.  We were alone for the most part and she kept non-seriously suggesting that we go upstairs (we were in my basement) to my room and have sex. I said that would be great but I also told her I knew that she wasn't serious. She also kept rubbing my leg, poking me close to my crouch, and other teasing like stuff. Whatever.

 Our conversation continued and she told me that she will never have sex with me. Ever. Under any circumstances. I already kinda knew this from previous conversations, but they were all of a more joking nature than this one. Well that sucks for me. Oh well. I love this girl enough that I can deal with that, at least for now, but it's slowly killing me inside how much she teases sex and then denies it. We both want this relationship to be serious and last, but I kind of doubt now that that it will last because of this situation. I also want to say this relationship isn't about sex, I'm fine without sex. What I am worried about now is her commitment to our relationship. If she will never have sex, then, what else won't she do, even for the sake of our relationship? I just have no idea how to proceed with this relationship, since me and her have already reached the point where we've done everything we can that's non-sexual and have been there for awhile. I don't want to sound like I'm being entitled to sex , because I'm not. No sex is fine at this point. I respect her wishes, but what she is doing with the teasing is slowly killing me inside and I don't know what to do now. 

**Tl;DR: Girlfriend teases sex all the time, I get denied , and then she says she will never have sex with me. Ever** </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, some of you may recall my last post looking for an FJ60. Well, I was unable to make a deal and so I'm looking at the Land Rover Series III mentioned. I've talked to the owner and it is beautifully mechanical wise, but the body is a tad beat up. How difficult is it to remove body panels on these things?  A Google search brought up nothing. Also, I'm planning for it to be a daily driver as well, and was wondering if any of you had a similar experience you can give input on. 

The whole vehicle

The worst of the body damage

I'm think I'm mainly looking at removing the rear quarters and pounding out the damage and then giving the whole vehicle a respray. The body has no rust, but does anyone have any input on repairing the damage?

	<TEXT> I've found a few in my budget, but they're a bit rough and kinda high mileage. I was wondering if i could get your guys opinions on which you think is best. So /r/4x4, what do you think my best bet for a new vehicle is? 

I'm looking for an older Toyota or Land Rover.

I'm thinking [this FJ62](http://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/cto/4968244636.html) is my best bet, but the mileage worries me.

This is my next [FJ60](http://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/cto/4927378979.html) I am looking at. Looks decent, but the rhino lined rust on the rear fenders bothers me. How easy to fix/expensive would it be to fix?

The final [FJ60](http://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/cto/4968443661.html) is a bit rough around the edges, but is quite a bit cheaper. I'm thinking it would be decent as a daily driver/project but again, the mileage bothers me.

Also was looking at this [Land Roveer Series III](http://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/cto/4911865938.html) that I am extremely tempted by. I absolutely *love* Land Rovers. A Defender is my dream vehicle, but unfortunately a Defender is out of my budget. I love older Rovers like this one too, and I know Land Rover isn't exactly known for reliability, I still want one.

It doesn't have any rust issues either. Owner is asking $4,000 for it. I'm suspicious at that price. Are there any issues I need to be aware of? It also has historical plates, which I don't like since it drives up insurance costs. Can I change that? Anyone know what the fuel economy would be around? 

Edit: I am planning on using the truck as a daily driver and occasionally hauling/towing. I don't have much mechanical experience, but have worked on my 1997 Ford Ranger before and don't mind taking the time to learn.

	<TEXT> So I built my PC about a month ago and everything went swimmingly. Except the I/O shield apparently. I have a metal tab sticking into an Ethernet port. Is that bad! My MoBo has two and I run off wi-fi anyways. Will it affect anything? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is more of an after action report than needing help but I have to share this.  I've spent the past two days trying to get my PC to play games at a good FPS. I was getting horrid FPS with my R9 290 and i7 4790. I tried updating the BIOS, reinstalled drivers at least for times and still couldn't figure out what was wrong. 

I was in power saving mode in power settings. I feel like an idiot. Everything works perfect now.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Troubleshooting] 100% CPU Usage in some games </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-25 16:51:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Specs are i7 4790 @ 3.5 ghz, Tri-X R9 290, 8gb Ram. 850w Gold PSU

I thought the issue was my GPU, but then I ran MSI Afterburner and noticed my CPU usage was extremely high in games. (Skyrim and ARMA II). It seems to work fine in some games though (Far Cry 3, KSP). 

Halp. I don't know what to do. I'm getting terrible Framerates in the aforementioned games (~16 FPS Skyrim and ~5 FPS ARMA II) because of it. 


Edit: GPU clocks are consistent at 300-400  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I built my PC a week ago and it worked flawlessly. Now I booted it up today and I'm getting terrible framerates. Like 10 FPS on Skyrim and 5 on ARMA II. Anyone know what's up? Card is a Sapphire Tri-X 290 OC. I'm running at 1440p through a DVI cable hooked up to the GPU. I already tried changing ports. Nada. 

Edit: According to MSI afterburner, my clocks keep dropping to 150 from 3000


Edit2: FIXED IT! Reinstalled drivers

Edit3: stopped working again. Halp.  </TEXT>
