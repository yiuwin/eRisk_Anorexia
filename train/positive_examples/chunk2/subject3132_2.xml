	<TEXT> Love this AMA. I just read through your blog it is superb! I noticed you didn't drink Pocari Sweat. Surprisingly, it is great. 

What was the reaction of the locals around to when you moved? Did they ask lots of questions? Not want anything to do with you? 
Thanks :) </TEXT>

Great to just chill out and listen to. I love the direction he has taken. Someone recently described him as the Willy Wonka of modern rock music. I couldn't create a sedition more perfectly suited to him.  </TEXT>
