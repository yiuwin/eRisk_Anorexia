	<TEXT> Does anybody else find that bronkaid has no effect when you're really tired? I tried it for the first time a few days ago and I barely felt anything at all. :/ But then again I hadn't been sleeping great over the period of three days I spent tossing and turning and I was dead exhausted. .-. The only thing it did for me that day is make me feel like I was on fire. (Calories burning maybe?)

/However/, I finally got plenty of sleep and tried it again today. DAMN.

20 minutes: I'm wide awake and ready to start my fasting day. I whip up some breakfast tea and crack open a diet soda with a vape. 

60 minutes: I have overwhelming nausea, like I could have projectile vomiting at any minute. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do much today.

90 minutes later the nausea if gone and I feel amazing. 

Seriously, go bronkaid. 

Rave over lol </TEXT>
