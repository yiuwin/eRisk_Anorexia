	<TEXT> No I don't want to forcefully change the way people inhabit the planet, I want to help people who struggle with problems because some neurotypicals are too selfish to listen to autistic people and chose to instead listen to bullshit from Autism Speaks. Autistic people are human beings and deserve to be treated as one, society is just so obsessed with fixing anything that doesn't fit in with the norm and blaming people for having problems. You're saying that it is better to eliminate autism, a neuro developmental disorder that can't be cured, than to actually look at the world and try and change it for the better. I think that's pretty selfish. </TEXT>
