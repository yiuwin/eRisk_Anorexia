	<TEXT> It's okay, just be careful about telling people with diagnosed eating disorders that they never had anorexia...it's just really triggering. You spend your entire life when you are ED-NOS striving for that anorexia diagnosis. It's the sick truth. So hearing "oh you needed to be even less than 93 lb" kinda sounds like "you're a big fat faker." I am sure you didn't mean to be offensive...it just kinda is. 


I know you're trying to help, so thank you for that. But make sure you check your facts. The recent change to the DSM-IV was that refusal to maintain a BMI below 18.5 is anorexic now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a green card, but the fatigue from my fibromyalgia is one of the worst parts. So it's difficult to use marijuana unless I'm desperate. Thank you so much for the encouragement.  </TEXT>
