	<TEXT> I'm not gonna lie, it is nice and I don't miss the lack of privacy. It isn't cheap though. /: Being an adult is one of the hardest things you'll ever do. 

I'm scared about going to hard off the deep end and getting hospitalized too (like general hospital, not psych, never psych again.) but even if you do "embrace recovery" (whatever that is) as an adult YOU get to run the show. Not an aloof bunch of "professionals" and your parents. Fuck that noise.
