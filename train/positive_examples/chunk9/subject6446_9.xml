	<TEXT> This will sound strange but In my experience the way that it happens is you realize slightly that you are dreaming and the entities in your dream dont want that and then it turns to sleep paralysis because you now know that you are asleep you can try to harness this into lucid dreaming if you can learn to take control of your dream when I was little I would realize I was asleep but I knew that the ppl in my dream couldn't know or they would hurt me and eventually I got up the courage to simply and calming state out loud in my dream that I was asleep and then the world will be yours to take control of idk if it works this way for everyone I think the reson it happens during ur naps is because you are only half asleep   Sorry for wall of text :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dont really remember it was a few years ago but my grandmother had recently passed away I think it was her or my minds version of her. Most of the time I dont really see a particular person I just hear the door open and I know someone is there but the part that scares me is always that I cant move or if I try to I lift away from my body and thats even worse than not moving  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My family and I had to drive to DC, and I fell asleep in the car and I woke up and couldn't move this happend a few more times and my terror increases I figured out how to make noise, it was like tiny little whisper screams. my mouth was wide open, and my teeth started to fall out, until my mouth was full of them, overflowing. Then my step dad turned around and looked at me a tear ran down his face and I woke up hyperventilating....sleep paralysis fun shit
