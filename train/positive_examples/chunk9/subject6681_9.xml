	<TEXT> It's going alright. Not as bad as one would think tbh. Honestly, the first 3 days are pretty bad and then once you slip into ketosis all hunger just sorta stops...

The only reason I had trouble yesterday around the 6.5 day mark was because I went out and did some exercise and that was a bad bad idea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Day 7+ of my fast!!**

Yesterday was a living hell. I couldn't even go to sleep. I've been awake for 24+ hours and am barely getting through my uni work.

Am I going to stop anytime soon? Nope. lol

Also I've officially lost the 2 lbs I gained during thanksgiving (and a little more) so thats a plus. I'm going to continue the fast for as long as I can because I need to play "catch up" on my weight loss.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 72 hours into my current fast.

I was a little too lenient during my thanksgiving meals. I need to show some self-discipline.
