	<TEXT> Hi so I take concerta, which is medication for ADD/ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 16 but only started taking it when I was 17. I'm 19 now and in college. I also take Prozac for depression. Just to let you know that I was given the prescription by my doctor and take them as they should be taken i.e once a day. </TEXT>
