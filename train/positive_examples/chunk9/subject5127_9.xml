	<TITLE> Need help for school newspaper </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-05 20:13:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm writing an article for my school's newspaper about cryptids and I was wondering if you guys would answer a couple questions for me. Any and all help is appreciated!
Questions:
- How would you define a cryptid?
- What makes you believe in cryptids or at least have some form of belief?
- What are the most common cryptids that you hear about?
- Have you ever had any sort of encounter with a cryptid?
- Which cryptid do you believe to be most credible and why?
-How does the rest of the scientific community view cryptozoology?

Thanks so much guys! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, he's been like that here recently due to an ear infection. But he's done the sassy head tilt thing when i talk to him since he was a baby. This was one of those times. His head tilt isn't as severe as it appears in the pic. That tilt, is simply enormous amounts of sass. </TEXT>
