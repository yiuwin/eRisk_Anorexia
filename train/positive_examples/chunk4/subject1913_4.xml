	<TEXT> Atheists don't believe in Satan, either. The point is that they believe in no mystical deities/demons fighting for possession of our so-called eternal soul. Most atheists believe that when we die...that's it. The synapses in our brain are no longer active, it's not a soul that makes a person who they are it is biology. We can pinpoint where, in the brain, someone's emotional controls are and destroy that and they may function semi-normally...and it's not like someone sucked their soul out, their brain was just damaged. 

Sorry, long-winded. Point is, atheists don't believe in Santa Claus or any other mythological character. Zeus was considered real once, too.  </TEXT>
