	<TEXT> Exactly. I'm constantly told by people (like my biological father) that my problems don't exist and I just want to punch him. As if I want to spend my young adult life stuck in bed when I used to be the happiest, most social person ever. 

I am terrified to piss of my parents because if they cut me off, I could lose the medical insurance through my mom. And then I'm fucking screwed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. It's so frustrating because I can't get disability benefits or anything and my medications cost upwards of $250 a month WITH insurance. I have had friends tell me I should take legal action with the family stuff, saying its abuse, but I can't live on my own through sheer inability to support myself. Some days I'm too sick to even get up to get water. It's been fucking awful. 

I'm just so lost and in pain with no hope of getting out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually use it on occasion, and it has been the ONLY thing to help my pain and that helps me sleep through the night. But I'm scared to use it because I am afraid to eat.

Edit: Also because it saps my energy and makes my brain even foggier than the fibro does. It makes it much harder to be productive. In small doses it is helpful, but I think it's still pretty hard to use.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...I'm not sure if that's supposed to be funny but it certainly isn't helping.

Edit: and now baconlover444 is PMing me with abuse. Yay.   </TEXT>
