	<TEXT> Keep trying to gain weight, but don't stress out about it. You are not too far under the minimum cut off so worst case scenario is you will have to get a waiver at MEPS. The Army tends to care much more about people being overweight rather than underweight. Me and a bunch of guys in my platoon at BCT (Fall/Winter 2015) were well below the minimum cutoff and no one cared. I'm not too sure about how the standards go for ROTC, because I had enlisted, but I am pretty sure you don't have to meet the standards until you actually commit during your sophomore or junior year. 

I would try and add more than just kettlebell stuff and cardio if you want to gain muscle rather than fat though. The FAQ has many great beginner programs and more info if you are truly interested
