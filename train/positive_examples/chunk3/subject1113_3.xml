	<TEXT> It hurts being referred to as female but I'm always feel nervous correcting people, even though I know I shouldn't be. What I can tell you as a person who doesn't believe in gender topics is to just accept people for who they are and use gender neutral language just in case.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not a question and I was actually diagnosed with autism when I was sixteen. But I don't like using labels like high functioning or low functioning because autism is a lot more complex than that. I go to college, I'm verbal and I can type etc, so I must be high functioning. But I also have problems with picking up social cues, sometimes I forget how to talk, I have problems with personal hygiene, I'm unable to live on my own and I have meltdowns, so I must be low functioning.   </TEXT>
