	<TEXT> Present drug use is just caffeine, cigarettes, occasional drink, and then a pretty regular weed habit. I used to do a bit of coke, MDMA, and speed though (drug use ~4 years total). Had a particularly bad speed binge about a year and a half ago which had some lingering effects on my brain, I'm sure. Hallucinations began sometime during the drug use I believe, it's kind of hard to tell.

Walls are "shimmery" or wavy, dark shadows pass by frequently in the perimeters, phantom smells, sensations of being touched or stroked gently. Plus the auditory hallucinations that you mentioned: seems to be triggered by white noise, voices that are usually angry/loud ie. fighting between two people (usually about me, although I can rarely understand the voices, just a choice word or phrase here and there). </TEXT>
