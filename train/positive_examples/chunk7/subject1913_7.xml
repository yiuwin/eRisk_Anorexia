	<TEXT> Actually I was diagnosed and treated. Anorexia nervosa diagnoses used to require a BMI of below 16.5, actually, and now the medical diagnosis guide (I can't remember the initials) altered the diagnosis requirements so, if I remember correctly, the weight standards are even more different. 

Please don't diagnose strangers on the Internet. I trust my multiple doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, nutritionists, and all of the other medical professionals that diagnosed me.  </TEXT>
