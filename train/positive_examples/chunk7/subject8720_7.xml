	<TEXT> Thank you everyone - I'm still managing all my treatments, and have started therapy for my social anxiety! I faced my first hurdle this week - a dreaded cold - and despite feelings rough, I still pushed through, and where I would be looking at possible IV's before, I feel strong enough not to need them. My lung function is improving, and my weight is starting to creep up. 
Thank you for the messages of encouragement - I hardly recognise the person I was a month ago, and if that's okay, I'd love to update you all in the future (which I hope will be a brighter one!) xxxx </TEXT>
