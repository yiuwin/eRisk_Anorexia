	<TEXT> I'm a female and I'm solitary, mostly due to the fact that there are no other wiccans in my area that I know of. I'd love to be in a coven though. I prefer natural magic. Though I prefer using tools in spells ( I just feel like it centers and enforces it better ) I don't always. I have never tried anything with the weather, other than enjoying its energy, or using it for meditation purposes. My family didn't take me serious at first and didn't want me learning about the craft, but now they are accepting of it since they understand it better now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's definitely best to wait until it's healed. That way you won't have to deal with infections which suck. I tried the same thing. I had just gotten a single lip piercing off to the side and i tried to change it too soon, it ended up red and infected and all around uncomfortable. I took it out and waited for it to heal and go away then got a different lip piercing. Definitely wait though. </TEXT>
