	<TEXT> They're very soft and chewy! I found that refrigerating the dough helps it to spread less which makes it softer versus crispy.  </TEXT>

* I omitted the raisins and used a cup of white chocolate chips and half a cup of grated carrots. I also used all butter since I didn't have shortening, and all white sugar since I had no brown.  Added extra cinnamon too.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ELI5: How can a person see a skewed image of themselves in the mirror? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-08 06:37:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been searching for the explanation of how people see skewed versions of themselves in mirrors for a while. 

I have an eating disorder and am currently in recovery and weigh 128 lbs and am 5'5. When I look in the mirror all I can see is how fat my legs are. How big my arms are. How big my face is. 

But when I tell others, they say I'm not seeing what is really there. 

How is that possible? How are MY eyes different from other people's? </TEXT>
