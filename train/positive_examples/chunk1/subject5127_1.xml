	<TEXT> I've got the same situation. I was on abilify last year but I've been put on seroquel for around 9 months. I've also gained weight. My doctor is likely to put me on latuda also. I don't know what the side effects are since it seems like all antipsychotics have a shitty side effect </TEXT>

I can't always speak and say what I want to say, therefore writing makes it easier. I've often written notes to family members too. Just a suggestion, I hope it helps. </TEXT>
