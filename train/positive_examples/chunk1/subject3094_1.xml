	<TEXT> I'm way late to the party, but I just feel the need to say that I really don't think this is the norm. I played softball for 14 years, and (please don't bang the 'STEREOTYPE' gong) I've spent a LOT of time changing with a LOT of lesbians. For the most part, they went out of their way to make sure the straight girls weren't uncomfortable, to the point where we would tell them to calm their shit and just change their goddamn clothes already. 

Honestly, at the end of the day, we were just exhausted and covered in dirt and didn't give a shit about anyone else's tits.  </TEXT>
