	<TEXT> Bought my partner a BlackWidow in 2015, my only regret is that I didn't keep it for myself. It's gorgeous, and I'd love to have one of my own, rather than borrowing his. The Razer Orange would be my ideal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two episodes in and I'm really enjoying it! It hasn't got the smartest writing, but the actors play well off one another, and there are some good comedy visuals (the vomit scene had me laughing out loud). 

Interested to see where this show goes! </TEXT>
