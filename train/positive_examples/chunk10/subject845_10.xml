	<TEXT> There's currently a "Free Phone For Everyone" Metro PCS deal that offers 12 phone choices. The deal is [here.](https://www.metropcs.com/free-for-all.html?icid=home|main|freeforall) 

I take tons of pictures so I'm looking for a phone with a great camera. I'm also looking for a phone with great battery life and a removal battery. Thanks so much!

	<TEXT> Edit: file should be a ".acnlmap" file

There's a save editor for acnl, http://www.marcrobledo.com/apps/acnl-editor/, and it has an option to import and export your town map. I was wondering if anyone knows where awesome town maps are shared. I'm terrible with editing my town layout, so I would love to find a map I can import. :3 </TEXT>
