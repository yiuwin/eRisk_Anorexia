	<TEXT> This is particularly true for Chinese and Japanese because their language doesn't have L sounds. In Japanese, there are R sounds instead. Katakana is used mostly for English words, and if they have an L in them, the closest sound in Japanese is R. For example, Lemon. Hiragana has only ra, ri, ru, re, and ro sounds. Re sounds closest to Le, therefore it's used in place of the L sound. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me me me me meeee! I love smoking. It doesn't usually give me the munchies, but the feeling is just so nice. I smoke now because it distracts me from being sad and stressed and it's just nice to forget for awhile, y'know? I'm so glad other people with ED's do this. I thought I was the only one </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not very pleasant, but drinking warm water makes you feel fuller. I think catching yourself when you're thinking about eating also helps. Eat small amounts and then stay away from the food. Being around it will only tempt you. Do something to distract yourself and avoid people who are eating. Sometimes that's difficult though. Best of luck though! xoxo </TEXT>
