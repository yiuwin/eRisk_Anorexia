	<TEXT> Yes the places in my dreams are often connected to other places for example my house and my school and my workplace are often the same huge building...they never look like they do in reality and im never in the situation I'm just wandering through it and also sometimes places are both outdoors and indoors like once I was on a highway but it was a huge tunnel it was almost like a fake highway inside a movie set or something  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im guessing that there is something in your life you dont know how to deal with you need guidance and comfort but you dont know where to find it most dreams are not cut and dry your mother in the dream might be a symbol for help and guidance to you that you are searching for and your father is probably a symbol of a person in your life you feel should be able to help you but cannot/does not this is just a very ambiguous interpretation it might help you think about the dream in a different context </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First im really sorry about your mother I cant image what that must be like condolences for your loss and secondly this might be a simplistic view of it but you miss your mom and you are looking for her...when she passed away did you not get to tell her something or did you feel like you didn't get to do something with her that you wanted to? Or are you having something stressful happen in your life that you think she could have helped with?  Sorry for all the questions but it helps with interpretation </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get hurt in dreams and can feel if for days afterwards its usually some disgusting infected wound and I feel itching and burning on the areas where it happened the worst one was my hand was cut at the bottom of my palm near my wrist and it was like a flap I could look into and I could see bone and green and yellow puss around it so fucking nasty I can feel it when I talk about it lol when I woke up I felt like the cut had closed but my hand was still like that on the inside... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing to the extent that it was when I was a child. I used to dream of that group of dark things (or a similar one) carrying me above there heads from my bedroom to the sofa in my living room I would wake up right after the dream and actually be on the sofa my mom says I used to sleep walk and I think I just walked to the sofa in my sleep but the dreams where so real and I always woke up where they left me pretty terrifying for a little kid...and It would happen every night so I just started sleeping on the sofa so they couldn't move me  </TEXT>
