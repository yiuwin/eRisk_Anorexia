	<TEXT> Well one of the side effects of concerta is loss of appetite which isn't good because I have to remind myself to eat. A few side effects of prozac at the start were headaches and nausea but they have gone away now. Before the medication I was able to focus but not on things I found boring, I had a lot more impluses to do things and my mind would just be racing all the time. I also had mood swings where I'd go from one extreme to the other and I had a lot of anxiety. </TEXT>
