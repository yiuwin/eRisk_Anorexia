	<TEXT> hey dont sweat, im 21 and im recovering from anorexia and PTSD and for a long time I had no discernable passions or goals. When I started recovering I just took some leaps and threw myself into multiple activities.. hiking, baking, painting.. heck even scrapbooking. It takes a while but with some motivation and perseverance Ive discovered that Im actually capable of being passionate about something again. Anything is worth a shot  </TEXT>
