	<TEXT> I'm curious to know if there's anyone else out there whose parents didn't save for their kids education. 

It seems as though I'm the only person in my friend group or of anyone that I ask, whose parents didn't save up for university. Thus, I have to pay for it along with my own rent (my friends' parents also pay their rent). 

My mom has apologized a lot, saying that they were so pressed for money that saving for us was impossible. I tell her it doesn't really matter, but deep down it bothers me that I have to pay for it myself while everyone else doesn't.

	<TEXT> I stumbled across someone's blog post about how happy they are that an abortion clinic is closing. 

I actually had to take a moment and try to not throw my phone at the wall. 

I have and always will be pro-choice. In no way am I gung-ho for abortion, but I believe that a woman should be allowed to have a choice. I just can't believe there are some women out there who vehemently stand against a person having a choice such as this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been battling with an eating disorder for the past year. I've made strides in getting better and want to start a 1200 cal diet. To me 1200 calories still seems like a lot. I'm scared I will gain weight from eating that much and am not leading a very active lifestyle at the moment. 

I hate eating bread or anything considered "bad" for you (although my weakness is peanut butter). How should I go about starting this diet? </TEXT>

How do guys enjoy it so much? Do you really get hot and bothered by it? To be honest, most girls sexting are sitting in their PJs watching TV not bothered one bit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recipe:

1 cup peanut butter
2/3 cup honey
2 eggs
Vanilla
2 tbsp oil
1 tsp Baking soda
1/2 c coconut flour
Pinch of salt

Extra Peanut Butter

Melt PB and honey in a microwave safe bowl until melted. Let cool.  Mix together eggs, vanilla and oil and add to PB mixture. Fold in baking soda and flour just until blended. Let dough chill for an hour. 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Take a small piece of dough and flatten out. Take a spoonful of peanut butter and place inside of dough. Take another piece of dough and seal in the peanut butter on other half. Continue until no dough is left. (I ended up with about 12 cookies). Press down cookies with a fork and bake for about 10 minutes. Broil for 2. Let cool a bit but serve warm!

**You can also do your favourite PB Cookie recipe and add PB to the middle. I just used coconut flour because I'm out of all purpose! But you can't even taste the flour.
