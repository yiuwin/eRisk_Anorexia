	<TEXT> This happens to me often :( my family and I had to drive to DC today, and I fell asleep in the car and I woke up and couldn't move eventually I figured out how to make noise, it was like tiny little whisper screams. my mouth was wide open, and my teeth started to fall out, until my mouth was full of them, overflowing. Then my step dad turned around and looked at me, he was crying...its not usually so dramatic but its always absolutely terrifying :/ </TEXT>
