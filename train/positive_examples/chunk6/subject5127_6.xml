	<TEXT> Don't give up so soon. If there are things you can do to fix your situation I think you should try. I know you don't want to but there's a chance that things will get better and you'll improve. It may take a bit, but if you just stick it out, just think. Everyone is destined for something great, but if you give up now, you may never know. I wish there was something I could do to help other then just give you kind words. If you need anyone to just listen to you, feel free to message me. Update us? Let me know if anything happens or if you start to figure things out. I'd love to talk to you and help you in anyway I can. Stay strong, friend. </TEXT>
