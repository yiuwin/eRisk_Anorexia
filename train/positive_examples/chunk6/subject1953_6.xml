	<TEXT> Does anybody else have any experience with tolerance breaks from caffeine? I'm thinking about taking it out for a month to reset my tolerance. :/ I don't have a crazy resistance to it but I think I'm too reliant on coffee/diet energy drinks/soda/etc. I still plan to drink green tea occasionally during my break though. Green tea is amazing. 

I can do it. It's all in my head. Just like my fast right now.

I don't know why I typed this out, I'm just thinking out loud. 
My EC stack is making me chatty. ._. </TEXT>
