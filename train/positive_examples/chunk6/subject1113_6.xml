	<TITLE> Society should learn to accept autistic people instead of trying to find a cure. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> If you don't know what autism is, it is basically a neuro developmental disorder and is characterised by difficulties with social interaction, verbal and non verbal communication and restricted and repetitive movements. What I am saying here is that people should accept autism as a different way of seeing the world and not as a disease. Autism should be something that is celebrated instead of anti vaxxer moms posting online about how they 'cured' their autistic child by giving them a gluten-free, sugar-free organic diet. Having autism is not the worst thing to happen to someone, organisations like Autism Speaks shouldn't spread fear and act like autistic people are puzzles that need to be fixed. </TEXT>
