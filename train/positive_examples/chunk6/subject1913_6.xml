	<TEXT> Haha it's okay, I don't mind. I'm just touched that you're taking the time to talk to me. I've been getting frustrated looking for resources for sick or disabled adults, but if I'm not legally disabled I can't benefit. If you're able to think of any specific resources that would be great! I don't know where to look, and it seems like Google is being purposefully obtuse and is not looking for what I need.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously thank you though. I know what you're saying is true but it's so fucking terrifying. I don't know how I could possibly deal with harder living at a shelter and an even worse life right now. I feel like I'm two seconds away from snapping. I'm trying so hard to keep it all together.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose. I won't be able to afford my medication and the pain will get worse. I need out but god I'm so scared. And now I'm getting shitty, abusive pms from that guy and I just want to pull my hair out and then down a bottle of pills. But I can't ask for help from them because they are sick of me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't know how many more times I can be abused before I give up. I almost did yesterday. I was sitting outside crying and my dad sat on the deck yelling sarcastic, horrible things at me while I begged him to leave me alone. But I couldn't go inside because I was going to hurt myself.  </TEXT>
