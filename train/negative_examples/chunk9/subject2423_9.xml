	<TEXT> Well in that case, you should probably still go with the 46. It has improved elbow articulation, and SH Figuarts style drop down legs. Plus, it's $10 cheaper I think. 

It's also got a swap out Tony Stark head that the 45 doesn't have, the "broken heart" chest plate, swap out shoulder pieces, and swap out forearm pieces, and a ton of lights. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am *this* close to just ordering some OT Figuarts and the 40th Anniversary Vader... I said I wouldn't buy them since I already have the whole gang from Hot Toys, but I already have almost all of the PT figuarts, and the idea of them all being in the same scale... It's enticing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have done that if he had posted what you did, because you showed no indication of watching these shows.

His problem seems to be that there are gay characters on TV that get character development. I doubt he had a problem with Alex Danvers on Supergirl, until she got her coming out arc earlier this season.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've seen on different articles comments by the conservatives saying they'll ditch Fox News for some other site or channel. I'm not too well versed in the "news" outlets of the far right to remember which. I'm sure it'll pop up in the comments of the article OP linked to in a few hours. For some reason, the far right loves commenting on The Hollywood Reporter.

EDIT: It's already happened. These people seem to think Fox News is liberal now, and that the old Fox News was the only thing holding the country together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a feeling Hasbro has another Cyclops planned. Possibly a Jim Lee jacket version. Maybe that's why they didn't bother giving Cyclops a different head, either unmasked or yelling, cuz they're gonna use that to as a selling point for a similar Cyclops figure that can be easily customized. </TEXT>
