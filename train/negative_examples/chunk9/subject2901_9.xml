I once thought V8 was like a fruit punch, except I didn't see that the can had vegetable drawings, not fruit pictures. So I drank it cold and was absolutely disgusting. My mother loves it though, I don't know how you people handle it at ROOM TEMPERATURE?

It's as disgusting as your username

Or how about the non-concealed fact, but still mind blowing fact, that the USA outsmarted Japan by knowing that they could hack in to the USA's code, but also knowing that Japan did not know that the USA could hear theirs?

The USA predicted that the code "AF" stood for Midway, and they said something along the lines of "Midway" to see if Japanese signals would communicate the same thing with "AF".

They were right! Smart people </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Storytime: When I didn't know about gimbal </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-03 02:43:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello Reddit!

I started playing KSP somewhere 2015 during the 1.0.5 versions. When I got the game, I used cheats and things to go to Eve and whatnot, but that's for a later time.

I, not inspired and guided by any tools or videos yet, was extremely proud of myself when I built something similar to the Saturn-V.

Of course I used the gigantic Mammoth engine, but as I was taking the very wobbly rocket (with not enough delta-v, screw you Mainsail!), I noticed something. If I have my engine on, I can turn easy, but if I don't (when I coast to apoapsis to insert into orbit) I end up having to use the tiny torque to turn.

Now I thought this was the case because I started to think that the engine firing kept the bottom of the rocket "locked on" to one position, so it was easy to turn the top of the rocket.

This obviously isn't the case.

From then on, I experimented with gimbal and made several discoveries about the game's building menus.

I just wanted to share this, thanks if you read!

TL;DR: I figured out that there was gimbal in KSP and didn't even know about it, was one of the first steps to learn science and KSP </TEXT>

If I'm not getting this wrong, why are you suddenly angered at whatever I posted/said?

 This conversation in general is valid and should have taught you something.

Yes, I agree with you. I have learned it. And please don't be so aggressive.

And the most important idea of my post is this: you can estimate about how old the book is by looking at the Pluto clue.

And that, in my opinion, is interesting. </TEXT>

Motorcycle coming toward me. These days I'd be like *OH SHIT* but back then I just moved.

I vaguely remember, I survived by less than two feet.

That day I learned an important lesson: cars and vehicles will avoid you first, if they're not crazy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, you're cold.

 This game has a steep learning curve! Be kind and helpful to users of all skill levels

Please respect that, also what's so terrifyingly low effort and bad about taking it with a phone? I think both things that were shared put a boatload of effort, so please respect that. We can share whatever we want, as long as it's related to KSP. Who cares about caps? I was excited too when I did my first moon landing.

 It was good, but it wasn't a recreation, learn what that word means.

Do we really give a damn about the meaning of those words? So you're a disrespectful Redditor who really has to pin-point everything about a simple grammar mistake I see.

Don't act like you're on top of everyone else...or it seems like it to many other people. </TEXT>
