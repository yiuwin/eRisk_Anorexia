	<TEXT> I can be empathetic but only about a fairly limited number of people. My family for example, and some of my friends. I care about animals a lot! 
 
  It's like I can switch empathy on and off but I definitely do have empathy. 

 This was my first official NPD dx but I've been told unofficially a few times that I have a lot of the traits.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hi 

 I've been diagnosed already with BPD. Today I was diagnosed with NPD, as well. 

 I thought that was impossible because the two seem so different. 

 Anyway, what now? I think my BPD symptoms are going away; I've not self harmed since March. The therapy waiting list is eight months at the moment. 

If the two do coexist it made me wonder about the idea about people with BPD being manipulative; I enjoy manipulating people but never saw this as a BPD thing. I just like being in control. 

 Eh I don't want to change but my doctor seems to think I should...  </TEXT>
