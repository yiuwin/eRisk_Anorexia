	<TEXT> Also I appreciate your critique. I'm not an artist at all. I made this during recovery from a brain injury and it probably is the part that would make it clearer as to why it misses the mark.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw it in a parking lot one day laying next to my truck and it reminded me of someone reaching for greatness but then there's a tragedy to it. 

I'm not an artist tbh. I just collected images I like and painted some that I like and if they make me have a feeling or second look I keep them for my "pics I like" folder. I decided to share the folder   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel you but I just dont see Love as so clear. It's messy to me. Original name of this picture was love is messy. In your opinion would that be clearer?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a picture of a candle with my first digital camera I got in '03. I was in S Korea. Forget the brand name but I got it from the big IT mart Seoul. If it was edited I did it with picture it 9 but I'm not sure it was edited. I don't edit anything now but do remember having that  program back then so there def a big chance  </TEXT>
