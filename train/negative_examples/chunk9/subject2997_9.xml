	<TEXT> The prevailing thought is that Idol would probably start in March, so it wouldn't have to deal with the Olympics and stuff like the Super Bowl and winter awards season. Scheduling Idol will be a high priority for ABC, they're not going to just squeeze it in somewhere to avoid disrupting a show like OUAT.

I could see OUAT moving to Fridays at 8, since ABC just axed the comedy block that's aired there the past few years </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note that I said what you should be able to expect to see on TV, not what TV currently looks like. Certain groups are definitely underrepresented while others are overrepresented (though as far as people of color go, if we're talking about American TV then it makes sense to compare to American demographics, not those of the entire world).

 The LGBT dying rate on tv is also not the same, not by any scale or standard.

Not saying you're necessarily wrong, but I want to see actual statistics on this. I see it posited quite frequently but never with actual data backing it up.

 How we feel as a group* has everything to do with representation.

I'm not saying people shouldn't feel that they should have representation. But expecting to be significantly overrepresented compared to the real world is just foolish, and if your representation on TV is in line the real world (hypothetical, not saying it necessarily is for any specific group) then complaining about being underrepresented is unwarranted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From that article:

 it's highly unlikely that ABC will cancel "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." this year.

Anyways that article is clickbait (that it only refers to total viewers and not to demo numbers is the first sign that it doesn't know what it's talking about).

[AoS was getting around a 2.0 in the spring of its first season.](http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/marvels-agents-of-shield-season-one-ratings-30009/) [Only 7 ABC shows (including AoS) averaged a 2.0 or higher that season, out of 25 total.](http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/abc-tv-show-ratings-for-2013-14-season-30249/) AoS was not getting poor ratings its first season and was thus is very little danger of being cancelled. </TEXT>
