	<TEXT> Hm, I didn't think about that. I normally print out my resume myself to bring to interviews, but you're right that I'd want it to look good printed in poor quality, in case they do it. I guess I'll make my watercolor texture a dividing line between the columns instead of the background of the column itself. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Crit my resume design </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm gonna be applying to a lot of graphic art positions, so I figure my potential employers will be extra critical of the design of my resume itself. Any advice would be appreciated! I'm posting mainly for the design, but if you see anything off putting in the content, feel free to point that out as well. http://Imgur.com/a/WUfZF </TEXT>
