	<TEXT> The GOP regularly changes the rules of their presidential primary contests nearly every cycle. For the past three cycles the changes have blown up in their faces. 

After 2008 they thought their primary was too short. The Democrats were still fighting it out and getting all the media attention. So for 2012 they lengthened the contest calendar.

The result was a drawn out primary where Mitt Romney was routinely embarrassed as the party's base moved from fringe candidate to fringe candidate before grudgingly accepting Romney. Because the primary was longer the attacks on Romney were probably greater than they would have been. The primary attacks hurt him badly in the general election. 

So to prevent a drawn out 2012 they put in place new rules that were thought to help an establishment candidate win early. Huge states like Florida would be earlier since GOP leaders thought only an establishment guy could win those (Rubio or Bush). Again things didn't go according to plan and did you hear? 

Donald Trump is now president of the USA.

	<TEXT>  Philip Rucker

Rucker is amazing, but he is a day to day political reporter who focuses on the White House. **Entous** and **Miller** cover the intelligence community and have many inside contacts. When officials from the Pentagon, FBI, CIA, etc want to leak they go to them. As a result they have been breaking a lot of news recently.

No other news outlet has as talented a staff as The Washington Post political team. I honestly believe if you subscribe to just one outlet it should be The Post.   

Other great WaPo reporters on this massive "Trump" story: 

Ellen Nakashima

Rosalind S. Helderman 

David Farenthold (took down the Trump Foundation and got broke the Access Hollywood tape.

	<TEXT> Ok, not really sure what you are arguing here. I'll just go point by point. 

I keep reading articles that say "may have" and "possibly" but I've yet to see anything beyond vague connections and communiques that don't really point that don't explicitly tell you anything about the context.

The United States intelligence community (DNI, CIA, FBI, etc.) [concluded that Russia tampered in our election](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html?_r=0) with the [goal of helping the Trump campaign win](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/us/politics/fbi-investigation-trump-russia-comey.html?rref=collection%2Fnewseventcollection%2FRussian%20Hacking%20in%20the%20U.S.%20Election action=click contentCollection=Politics module=Collection region=Marginalia src=me version=newsevent pgtype=article). No one within the US government disputes this. 

Meanwhile multiple instances of ties between Trump and Russia have come to light. Campaign official Carter Page, Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, Trump son-in-law and current Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner, Campaign surrogate and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Campaign advisor and former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn all had contact with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump's inaguration. Flynn and Manafort, especially, have deep ties to Russian government officials and allies. Manafort also secretly worked for a Russian oligarch and close Putin ally to ['influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and former Soviet republics to benefit President Vladimir Putin's government.'](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a/manaforts-plan-greatly-benefit-putin-government) Let me remind you Manafort ran Trump's campaign. 

Congressional investigators are currently reviewing classified information (a lot of which was obtained from the US intelligence community). If we learn of any smoking gun or talk of evidence it will probably be because a congressperson decided to leak it. The FBI is currently conducting an investigation and they are obviously not going to reveal evidence before announcing indictments.  

why isn't anyone talking about the massive amount of money we've flowing in from Saudia Arabia and China?

Obviously this is an issue but we are currently watching what is potentially the greatest political scandal is American history unfold before our eyes in horrific fashion. We have room in our minds for many things, but it would be insane to say this topic shouldn't be considered a priority.
