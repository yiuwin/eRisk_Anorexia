	<TEXT> Mali's crisis is a classic case of conflict triangulation. When you have a serious conflict in one country theres always a high risk of the war spreading to the countrys neighbours. This mostly happens because of the movement of fighters, refugees, weapons, and pre-existing political issues. In Africa alone, this has happened in Somalia (affecting Kenya and Ethiopia), Rwanda (main cause of the DRC wars, which have never ended), and now Libya. The rebels who started the Mali conflict are suspected to have fought for Gaddafi before his regime fell. That is also where they got their weapons and expertise from. So if the Libya conflict had not happened the way it did, there is a chance that Mali would have remained a stable nation.  </TEXT>
