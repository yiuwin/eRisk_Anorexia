You're all fakes, run to your mansions
Come around, we'll kick your ass in."

	<TEXT> Making this thread because one of my favourite songs this year, 'Resist' : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23Fn12fUhCk, has less than 100,000 views. DJ Friz (worked with Heize) has created such a chill track here and its a crime that it doesn't have more attention. The art in it is strangely captivating as well. 

Other songs I think need more love include:

Hyukoh - Panda Bear (780,000 views) - The lyrics in this song really resonated with me. Hyukoh's voice is just 3 as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwSF28PG_Fo


Code Kunst - Fire Water (535,000 views) - He previously worked with Oh Hyuk in one of my favourite songs ever (Parachute), this song features another gorgeous voice with G.Soul
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwKfPS0YMlY


offonoff - Photograph (385,000 views) - Best song for night drives, hands down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b1E-zu-QEM


Eric Nam x Timbaland - Body (70,000 views) - A simple song, but still quite catchy. Definitely deserves more than 70,000. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All these people on social media complaining about the new cast members are really pissing me off. Firstly, why are there complaints when they haven't even done a proper ep together yet. Secondly, you can't just comment 7012 everywhere thinking that it proves a point because Gary's gone off. Thirdly, change is needed for RM. They cannot stick with the same concept the whole time. Fourthly, for fucks sake, people need to stfu about Jihyo being the only woman. I like her, but a fresh female presence with a personality that isn't so conservative is needed.These people need to stop crying, get their heads out of their asses and understand that people are actually trying to improve the show and this bitching before the new cast show does not help at all. 

If you bothered reading this whole rant, I sincerely applaud you. </TEXT>
