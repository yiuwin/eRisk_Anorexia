	<TEXT> Lowering the setting will make the screen eventually so dark that he can't see what's being displayed, it would not make him go blind. 
  
Increasing the brightness would have a better chance at doing that - thought it wouldn't work.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Steam Workshop Mods Won't Download </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-08 17:30:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've downloaded them in the past, but now current mods won't update, even though I can see in the workshop that there are new patches for them, and new mods won't download. 


My game is up to date, as is steam, I have cloud sync enabled and have cleared my download cache. 


Any ideas ? 


Thanks.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Event box options, for the most part, don't allow you to click through them right away, you have to wait for them to turn from grey for a second. This is irritating especially when you're going through many in succession. Any ideas on how to change the game files so that the events are immediately clickable ? Thanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To do with oration, and used in law. Starts with a d. It could be used to describe a legal technique. I want to say it was one of the ancient disciplines that were taught, as in, mathematics, philosophy, etc. Something to do with logic and reasoning. 
    I know this is vague. 
    Couldn't put spaces in the title, I'm using Reddit mobile for iPhone. Must be a bug. 


Thanks in advance !

	<TEXT> The Celtic nations, bar the Bretons, are the ones that have been oppressed by the english and their union and are the ones who will be in the confederation, so it is more important what they would think rather than some country across the sea. Your argument is ridiculous.
