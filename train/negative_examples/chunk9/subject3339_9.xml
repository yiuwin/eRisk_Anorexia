	<TEXT> Context is key 1880 we started taking measurements of the world and since then we have a average global temperature rise of 0.8c it's raising about 0.006c per year. 

Now if that trend continues we will hit 1.5 in another 137 more years give or take a few.

This article is shit and someone should repost it in 128 years so it can be accurate  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Science 

As the planet gets warmer it evaporates more water leading to more rainfall in most of the world some places may stay drier but it is having an effect on the planet that's for sure.

Major storms and droughts are less likely to happen, Africa is getting greener, Canada and Russia north are becoming more hospitality for  crops, we have a more efficient and effective shipping lane ie the northwest passage. 

Tldr: when the planet is warmer is more tropical making life better for all.

Side note
Science had a consensus that the world was flat till one scientist with a different opinion prove that it wasn't same thing happened with every major scientist throughout history.
