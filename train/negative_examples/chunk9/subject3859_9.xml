	<TEXT> Yass exactly right. I sometimes over do it and don't know when to stop painting.  This was an example of stopping a few layers in without refining things too much. For me the texture and movement of the strokes bring the work to life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has always been my favorite style of painting.  I'm not sure of the exact type, but I've always thought of it as 'abstract impressionism'.  Someone correct me if I'm wron
g. 

I'd say it definitely falls on the line of abstract impressionism. Some of my works start there but will have focal areas rendered to a realism approach to extend that range from obsecure to definition in the overall image. This one was left in the early layered stages but I think the harmony and atmosphere are present.  </TEXT>

People are getting angry over me not having my head covered, playing music in the background, and the little things like that. I think it's a matter of education... my mother actually believes she can scream cuss yell all day long and walk into the gurdwara with her head covered to make everything alright. I feel the actual beliefs systems are being lost and in their place, are these certain actions that leave most people with a false sense of accomplishment. I have a lot more to say but uhhh i gotta get started on the next painting sessiion..... join me if you'd like.. instagram:art_of_raman </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey you know. I really did want to create my own version and also have done that in the past. But every other painting out there is based on the facial structures from the reference I used. The portraits in this piece are not finished and by the end of it , I will have found a way to distinguish them in my own style with detail and lighting from Sobha Singh's work. I will admit I'm using his paintings as a reference, it's like trying to replicate multiple masterpieces and understanding exactly what steps he took to create them in terms of compositional color arrangements as well as the facial expression down to the t.  Thank you for asking though  </TEXT>
