	<TEXT> Someone must've obtained your old password somehow most likely through old databases (you should change passwords every 2 weeks) Then they used a method to get through authenticator. If you want I can message you the link to the post on it. (Not going to post it in here cause it will trigger someone/probably get deleted as it is an exploit). Seriously though getting hacked is the worst feeling   I wish you luck on the rebuild.  </TEXT>
