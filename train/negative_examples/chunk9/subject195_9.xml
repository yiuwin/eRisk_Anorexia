It could easily be explained by a typo say if he was swiping on an android phone. My phone does this all the time and sometimes I hit send before I see it. 

I feel as though people just like to jump on this sort of thing because it's an easy way for them to make themselves feel smarter than someone else.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, misogyny pertains to women(plural) in general and this situation is just dislike of someone who happens to be a woman (singular). 

Also saying that she looks like a man in drag is at least a little bit different than saying she looks like a man, though admittedly not much.

Point is that there are loads of women who do deserve and do have my respect and there are loads of men who don't deserve and don't have my respect. It's not about male or female. 

However, I do agree with you though, that a president needs to be better than the average reddit user.  </TEXT>
