	<TEXT> My dad and uncle never really knew their dad. They just knew of him and that he was a Dutch sailor. Jump ahead 30 years, my dad and uncle have completely given up on ever meeting the man. My uncle is on holiday in Greece sharing a villa with a Dutch family. They get talking and my uncle mentions that his dad was Dutch and tells them his name. The holiday continues, the Dutch family go home. A few days later my uncle gets a phone call from the villa. (The Dutch family have gone home and told my uncles story to a friend. The friend knows who this man is). My uncle picks up the phone. "Hello, I believe I am your father". What are the odds </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it might have done but I didn't notice because I thought it was the smell of the hole he'd burnt into the soda bottle to make the bong </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happened about a year ago but I still think about it because it was the time that made me stop smoking.
Me and a friend were hanging out with this guy we'd just met. He offered us a joint back at his house, we agreed. We get back to his and instead of a joint, he brings out a bong. As well as the weed, he pours some of the crystal residue you get built up in the grinder. 
I take the first hit. Immediately, the smoke hits my lungs in a way that makes me think "Jesus h. Christ". It burned and just felt odd. I remember thinking "I've made a mistake". It just seemed unusually powerful. My friend takes a hit, he's a big guy, 6'3 and not unfamiliar with trees. So I thought he would take it like a champ and it was just me being a big ol' pansy. About 30 seconds in, it starts to hit me hard and it's not long before I see he same look of horror on my friends face.
Jump forward about 5 minutes. I'm at the upper edges of controllably high. Me and my friend are walking around outside and the guy we were with has abandoned us (probably because we were too high). We both go passed our limit and start freaking out. I start hallucinating. The whole world is shaking, I'm seeing aliens telepathically invading my head. My friend thinks he's in the Truman show and I'm an actor. I was getting quite worried he was going to attack me. It was just insanity. I was throwing up for what seemed like eternity. We eventually manage to make it back to his place, 3 hours later and I passed out on the floor. I've greened out before but nothing like this. I thought I'd lost my mind. Any thoughts?

TLDR: smoked weed that made me see aliens </TEXT>
