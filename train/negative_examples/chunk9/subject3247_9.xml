	<TEXT> If you can find it, try [Franklin Farms Portabella Veggiburger](http://veggieland.com/pages/FranklinFarmsPortabellaBurger.html). 

It's so good I'd rather have it than any meat burger. Cook it on a grill using the method I described above, but add a little [Kerry Gold Butter and cheese](http://kerrygoldusa.com/products/) and some grilled onions. 

Heaven.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Buy a small cast iron skillet and place it on the grill and then place the veggie burger in it with some onions and sliced tomatoes. 

Cover the cast iron, or don't. 

Enjoy :)  </TEXT>
