	<TEXT> Definitely, I was referring to his own promotional video. There's A lot of them, he shows what looks to be nothing more than a giant cardboard picture, with white and just a little black sand on it. He stands it up and BAM! Theres no where near enough black sand to cover it. As an artist (kind of) He's a fraud, you can't make, sort of a DIY video and have the end result be deceitful. 

I was kind of surprised to see this is bigger than it is yet. </TEXT>
