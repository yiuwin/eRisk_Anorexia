	<TEXT> A person's a person, no matter how small.  Dr. Seuss

Respect for ourselves guides our morals, respect for others guides our manners.  Laurence Sterne

I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.  Albert Einstein

Respect yourself and others will respect you.  Confucius

If you want to be respected by others, the great thing is to respect yourself. Only by that, only by self-respect will you compel others to respect you. Fyodor Dostoyevsky

When we treat people merely as they are, they will remain as they are. When we treat them as if they were what they should be, they will become what they
should be.  Thomas S. Monson

Tolerance only for those who agree with you is no tolerance at all.  Ray Davis

Men are respectable only as they respect.  Ralph Waldo Emerson 



That you may retain your self-respect, it is better to displease the people by doing what you know is right, than to temporarily please them by doing whatyou know is wrong.  William J. H. Boetcker

One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say.  Bryant H. McGill

Treat people the way you want to be treated. Talk to people the way you want to be talked to. Respect is earned, not given.  Hussein Nishah

Respect is a two-way street, if you want to get it, you've got to give it.  R.G. Risch

Without feelings of respect, what is there to distinguish men from beasts?  Confucius

I must respect the opinions of others even if I disagree with them.  Herbert H. Lehman

I firmly believe that respect is a lot more important, and a lot greater, than popularity.  Julius Erving

To be one, to be united is a great thing. But to respect the right to be different is maybe even greater.  Bono
