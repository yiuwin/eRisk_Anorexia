###Observations

* 30 Rock for the third year in a row has ranked #30.

* 3% also happens to rank #30 on the 2016 shows list.

* Past favorites Fargo and The Wire went from rank 3   4 to rank 14   12 respectively, big drops.

* Luke Cage, although overall popular, has not been nearly as much of a hit with redditors as Daredevil and Jessica Jones.

* The highest ranking ties are between House of Cards and The Sopranos on the all-time favorites list at ranks 23 and 24, and between 11.22.63 and The Crown on the 2016 favorites list at ranks 8 and 9.

* Since the 2014 survey, among the shows in the original top 10, True Detective has lost the most ranks, going from #10 to #31.

	<TEXT> I saw the older Berserk on the list and remembered there was a new one in 2016. If no one asks me to add something to the list then I just assume there's no interest in it. I know that's not 100% true but yeah. Plus I think /r/anime has their own polls and surveys anyways, there also doesn't seem to be many anime watchers that participate in this survey. In 2014 when I allowed for free responses, barely anyone put in anime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a tough predicament, I know /tv/ brigaded the poll already but since it happened simultaneously with your x-post to the MDE subreddit it's hard to tell the legit responses. If it was just the MDE subreddit then I wouldn't care about the skew. As far as I can tell so far, only /r/Survivor has also linked to the survey.

Not sure yet if I'll care enough to try to filter out the votes. The only /tv/ users to vote are probably redditors anyways. Plus if MDE tops the list then maybe other fandoms will care enough to try to brigade next year, it's not like the poll has any hope of being scientific anyways. </TEXT>
