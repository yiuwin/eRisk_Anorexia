	<TEXT> Hi there again.  I did as you said. Since I don't have those values, I used 2* 2K and 2* 22K in paralell, and this is the result:

Now, is the lower side of the grap a negative voltage? Can my soundcard measure negative voltages?

	<TEXT> Thanks! If I use a pot instead the 1k would It work as a variable volt? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. I am trying to learn some electronics by myself, now I am working on  AC-DC power. I have used a power transformer, and removed the coils. 

The primary coil is plugged to the wall shocket, and the secondary to a homebrew oscilloscope using the soundcard from the pc and the multimeter on AC

 The voltimeter reads 8.8 volts The soundscope shows a perfect square signal at 50 Hz, and 2.00 volts pp ( see imagen below)

I have many questions: 

1. May I burn the sound card of my old laptop? 

2. If so, how could I protect it? 

3. I expected a regular sinewave. Why is it square?

 4. What is going on with the voltage here?

	<TEXT> Hi everyone! I am finishing my time fountain.
It uses an small water pump from a regular fountain, and as the drop system I got one of those medical droplet regulators. I hope you like it
As you can see in the video, it uses an UV led strip. The water is not yet fluorescent, and the flickering you see is due to the frame rate of the phone, not the device itself. However, I think I could improve it with the timing with two changes:
1st. Calculate with more precision the drop rate with a laser pointer and a light sensitive resistor (I don't remember the exact name right now). Any other ideas.
2nd. Play around with the strobe light (time on - off). Does anyone know what would be the best times for this? </TEXT>
