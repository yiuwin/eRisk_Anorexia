	<TEXT> Mayby our outside views stem from docunentaries where they show teachers who cant show how to put on a condom, so they have to use a sock demostration on their feet

But in scandinavia our sex ed is taught in the 5/6th grade and again in 7th and 8th in more depth. They know we are gonna fuck so take care of it early

We are taught the reproductive system, pregnancy, birth control, condoms, disease.
Girls have separeted discussion on periods,pap -smears and what not

But biggest diffrens : abortion is coverd by national health, no healthcare worker is alowed by law to decline in assisting in the abortion. And its offered in every  "state/region/province"  </TEXT>
