The more vertical ones I left a little higher, because shrinking them more wouldn't look that well, if the trophy fit well, those should too, I kept vertical ones below 40px (like the trophy). Others resized to 32px in height. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do I stop YouTube live stream? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-26 16:44:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't get it. I follow the instructions which says in order to stop the stream:  
To stop, simply stop streaming from your encoder. YouTube will detect that you stopped sending content and stop the stream for you.  

So I stop the streaming from my obs, the youtube stream goes offline, but the stream archive doesn't appear in my video manager and when I refresh the "Stream now" page the "Elapsed time" still continues. To get my stream archived and show up in my video manager I went to Stream nowBasic infoAdvanced settingsLive Control roomStop streaming.  

Is this how you supposed to do it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Having trouble with the sweet   sour sauce recipe </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-20 14:08:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Recipe here: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/19670/sweet-and-sour-sauce-i/  

Ingredients:  
3/4 cup white sugar  
1/3 cup white vinegar  
2/3 cup water  
1/4 cup soy sauce  
1 tablespoon ketchup  
2 tablespoons cornstarch  

Directions:  
Place the sugar, vinegar, water, soy sauce, ketchup and cornstarch in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Stir continuously until the mixture has thickened.  

I did everything as said in the instructions, weighed in all the ingredients correctly and the problem is with the vinegar. I don't know if I'm using the wrong vinegar or something, but as soon as I smelled the sauce when it was cooking, I thought my lungs was about to explode in my chest, I could barely taste the sauce as the vinegar felt really really strong in it.  

Is it something wrong with my choice of vinegar or is the recipe faulty? I don't understand. On the bottle it says "Food vinegar acid (9%)".  

Really need help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My perspective is that extraterrestrial life existing is interesting, exciting, and wonderful. But I don't think I should believe in it until after I've seen evidence.  

I agree with you.  

I think anything can be quickly dismissed on the internet, but just having interesting information in your mind or reading it whether it might seem impossible to someone it's still is exciting and opens up your perspective of what's out there. 

Or do you have evidence I haven't seen?  

No.

I can say that those big gray alien eyes are an adaptation to their world. The worlds they (zeta) come from have dim suns and like our night vision animals they needed their large dark eyes to take in the available light. </TEXT>

Nope.  

There's genuinely nothing I want more than to meet real aliens.  

Be careful for what you wish for, if you really put your mind and thought to it, anything can happen.  

 I'd love to know where you got this information.  

plz don't ask.

Hmm... I think I can tell you that traveling at the speed of light is not the way to travel interstellar and the scientists that are dreaming of creating spaceships that could travel at least near the speed of light sounds really funny to me, ebe's don't travel like that. </TEXT>
