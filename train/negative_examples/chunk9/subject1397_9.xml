	<TEXT> I was thinking about asking about this. It's kind of like looking at polls at the time, a huge percentage of Americans were isolationist in WWII, nearly half were anti-desegragtion, and Joe McCarthy was enormously popular. 

You'd be hard pressed to find anyone admitting this. It's almost as if the people making up those demographics magically disappeared 3-5 years after those ideas became unacceptable. 

Like Jeff Sessions would come across a lot more believable if he admitted past mistakes, and shown he wants to try to change, but nope. Never racist, didn't know any racists. Least racist guy.

	<TEXT> I would love a multi-biopic of the leaders of WWII, from childhood through end of war: Hitler, Mussolini, FDR, Stalin, Churchill, Hirohito.


Each has fascinating backgrounds, from early on, in their personal lives, and would be amazing to see them and how their lives brought them to where they ended up. 

Churchill in South Africa, Stalin, his joining the revolution and leaving Russia and return, etc. Contrasted with Hitlers banal upbringing and FDR,'s patrician,and Hirohito prince, and then how they get to power, and manage it. 

The comparisons and contrasts and woven story would be amazing, as personal stories </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That depends on what your salary could be. For example, I could get a job now that pays 45-50k, or go to college, get a job that pays 60-70k. Even if you count interest and payments and on 90k school loans and opportunity cost, I'm still 15% ahead of where I would be otherwise. That's in addition to being able to do the job I actually want to do, and open up larger opportunities for advancement for even better pay. And also I won't ruin my body as much. 

That didn't even take into account federal debt programs such as RePAYE, which puts me in farther ahead.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition to Todd math. There is a residential portion of the white house, which is not ceremonial, and I'd like a real home, and there is a lot of leeway in redecorating, and is generally updated about as often as your parents home or so, just updating the appliances and backsplash and paint, etc. 
And the recreation rooms, such as theater and bowling alley are changed by preference. 

Then the oval office is specifically redecorated and finished by each president to their own taste, including the rug. Some elements remain consistent, like the desk, but they're not required to. Art and the like, as Todd said, is borrowed from museums and such. 

Also, a large portion of the white house, like the wings, are simply offices for staff. They're updated and redecorated as personally needs change, and are not historic, etc. 

The parts that generally remain the same and are not changed aer the exteriors and the ceremonial rooms, like the blue room, and some historic rooms like the Lincoln bedroom. Same with outdoor spaces, ceremonial spaces, like the Rose garden remain mostly unchanged, but the rest is up for grabs. Obama added a swing set, a vegetable garden and a basketball court.

	<TEXT> You're missing the point of the comparisons in this case.

It's not that people believe that it will inevitably lead to a Holocaust. It's that it has the potential.

It's like, for every leader that has the potential to end up in a Holocaust, only 1 in 500 lead to a genocide. 

But the way you prevent a Holocaust, isn't by waiting to see if it will be one, but stopping it before it turns into one, and stopping anything that looks like it's leading down that path. 

For example, will Erdogan become a Putin like figure, or a Hitler like figure, or a Mussolini like? 

It can go any way, and it's really up to various mechanisms and circumstances that could be external to him that will lead him to where he is going. But it's clear he's on the way, and Hitler is just an extreme end, but nevertheless a possibility. And possibilities necessqtate Counter-measures. 


Hitler himself did not envision the Holocaust in 1928 or 32. The Holocaust did not even officially begin until 1941 (wansee conference).

All hitler knew was that he hated Jews, and wanted to deal with them. Only as his power increased, and suddenly he had the power to act upon his hate, did he even begin the nurnberg laws. 

And as war began, his Jewish population began to increase (as he captured territory), and wanted a "solution" to deal with them. And that's why there was a conference anyways. 

It in a twisted sense, simply a beauraucratic response to a logistical question: we don't want Jews, we are aquiring, let's deal with them. 

So the progression isn't simply in the state, as a goal, but rather preventing circumstances that lead to it. 

Donald Trump was elected on a platform of targeting specific populations, and the issue becomes a logistical one, how to deal with these huge populations. 

The final solution was actually arrived upon a simply the most cost effective. 

What do you think the most cost effective way to deal with 12 million illegal aliens and 2 million Arabs in the us is? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Am architect. You're correct. I have no idea who led people to upvote the other answers. Any large building will have heating elements around the pipes themselves to heat to specific temperatures. 

Also, pressure in any high rise will be through a pump and ta k systems. No city water will pressurize water to a fifth floor or higher.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The boom-bust cycle tells us we were in for a moderate recession in the next 2-4 years anyways. It's how bad it will be is the question. 

One thing trump is good at is optics, we're going to see trump visit some factories and he will show how he's forcing the business leaders to make concessions for the workers, and his supporters will say how he's tremendous, and the recession is just a ploy by the Dems and globalists.

(See " Putin restarts factory" for example)

Don't kid yourself that his loyalists will suddenly realize they were duped. Because a) he's good at marketing himself and b) people don't admit they're wrong, even to themselves. It's too hard

	<TEXT> There are physical limitations at 1.9 that are not motor and power related. Rather tire and road limitations (deformation  at that level of torque) that have not been solved, and are not in teslas purview. 

Imho, tesla will focus the roadster, like other sports cars, on 60-130 and top speed (and handling). 

Models S p90dl is about half the Aventador in the 60-130 range, (7.6s vs 11.7s, because of battery inversion and cooling, and power drain) </TEXT>
