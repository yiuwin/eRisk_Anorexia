	<TEXT> I went to the bathroom in a nightclub a few years ago, the whole place was full and I saw one urinal that was free in the corner. I walked up to it and noticed that there's a baguette in the urinal... And it also looked like someone had vomited on it too... It looked (and smelled) so horrible that I nearly vomited on it also, so I went as far as possible from it and waited for another urinal to be free. Meanwhile some other drunk people saw it and started to take pictures of it.

I was wondering the whole time, how did someone manage to sneak in a whole baguette into the nightclub when usually the bouncers can easily spot if someone is sneaking alcohol.

A few months after that, I was in an askreddit thread about weird Wikipedia links and someone explained this same phenomenon and added that the baguette is meant to be eaten after... The article was sadly only in French and I'm having a hard time finding that thread again.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about, can you help me find that thread or the French Wikipedia article? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We might be closer to developing AI than we are at developing fast ways to travel to different solar systems.

Since there's a good chance that there's intelligent life in the universe/galaxy, there's also a chance that they have developed AI already and have answered the questions about AI that we are still thinking today.

Would it be hostile and rampant? 

Or would it be cooperative with other beings?

If there's a chance that we would meet some form of intelligent life, there could be a chance that it could be clanky instead of meaty, or why not both?

Would we be in the way of whatever we meet or would we be a part of something great? And how can we be sure that we aren't just being used for something else? </TEXT>

The lawnmower looks like some clothing with patches of cloth sewed into to cover cracks and holes, but in this case it's patches of metal bolted onto cracks. The whole thing rattles like crazy and it's the loudest lawnmower in the neighbourhood (they live near a landing strip so thank god for sound proof windows though.)

I fear that some day the blade will come out flying and kill Achilles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [It's also possible that they killed themselves.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Flight_858)

The two bombers were traced to Bahrain, where they both took ampules of cyanide hidden in cigarettes when they realized they were about to be taken into custody. The male of the pair died, but the female, Kim Hyon-hui, survived and later confessed to the bombing. She was sentenced to death after being put on trial for the attack, but was later pardoned by the President of South Korea, Roh Tae-woo, because it was deemed that she had been brainwashed in North Korea. Kim's testimony implicated Kim Jong-il, who at that time was the future leader of North Korea, as the person ultimately responsible for the incident. The United States Department of State specifically refers to the bombing of KAL 858 as a "terrorist act" and, until 2008, listed North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [EE hunt] Are we sure that the Easter egg hinting the next season is located in Bartlett? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-14 13:25:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A lot of people have started to look for the new Easter egg in the Bartlett map since it's the most recent map for pvp. But how can we be sure that these Easter eggs haven't been there since the Article Five version and people started to find them now since there isn't smoke blocking everything.

IIRC they hinted about the next Easter egg right after the last season came and that was before the Bartlett map was released. We also don't know how long has [this hidden message](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/5n7kd6/so_is_there_a_new_easter_egg_hunt_i_didnt_know/) been here and if it has to do with the last seasons map.

**TL;DR:** The Easter egg we are looking for is probably in the Skyscraper map instead of Bartlett university. </TEXT>
