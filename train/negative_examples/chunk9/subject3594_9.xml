	<TEXT> So this does not effect me but for me the tutorial on the PS4 version is broken.  First Ying never comes out of spawn.  All is fine until the objective capture part happens.  No enemy ever appears and the objective gets to 100% and lights up. But it never transitions to the next objective of pushing the payload.  The objective just keeps flashing and you can not finish the tutorial. I have tried multiple times but it does not work each time. </TEXT>
