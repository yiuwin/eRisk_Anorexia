	<TITLE> [SnK anime spoilers] My anime scene of the year </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-09 03:15:32 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I'll start by saying that I was already cut up with the SnK manga even before the latest episode but let me tell you: the moment when Reiner and Bertolt transformed sent a shiver down my spine and water my eyes.

It was the combination of the animation, OST ( *oh the OST*) and the general ultimate betrayal that the characters faced that did it for me.

You can see what I'm talking about  [here](https://youtu.be/ymf-q6M28-g). 

I personally don't think any anime this year could ever top that and would go so far as saying it's been one of the best scenes I've seen in anime in recent years.

What do you guys think? </TEXT>
