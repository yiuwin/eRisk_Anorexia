	<TEXT> His last long experience with you was drugs so his mindset went back. Understand that. He is only looking out for your daughter.

I also understand your frustration. Trying to not associate yourself with your past. It's over. Done. Your kid doesn't even need to know and it's frustrating that after ten years of being clean "you still can't be trusted".


1. It's your family. Sit them down. Introduce everyone. Let them know that YOU ARE FULLY AWARE OF YOUR PAST. But for a DECADE you have been clean and healthy and have a healthy family.
2. Your kid should know them regardless or a pissy uncle. Don't let him intimidate your out of your family.
3. Apologize and ask to start over. Hang out with the peeps. Hey, some big holidays are coming up.


If he is still pissy, just tell him to cool off and watch it around your teeny one. Boom. </TEXT>
