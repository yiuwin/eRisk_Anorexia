	<TEXT> Yes I'm french (as you can probably see from my grammar) :p

Actually I play on a laptop, so purchasing a QWERTY is gonna be more of an inconvenience than anything else. There is also the fact that in France we are USED to use AZERTY keyboard, I don't even know how to make "-", "_" or special symbols on a QWERTY keyboard. I will post that on the Paradox forums if it is more likely to be read by the devs or the CM :)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does someone knows whether Paradox is planning to implement an AZRTY keyboard support for their game or not ? I know AZERTY keyboards are not the most common across the world, but I'd appreciate it that the devs add a feature that allows us to map keys according to our liking </TEXT>
