**Summary** | 
:--|:--
The first news program of its kind to air on HBO, VICE News Tonight provides an indispensable source of up-to-date news to viewers who have grown increasingly skeptical of the daily broadcast news format. Under the leadership of VICE EVP Josh Tyrangiel, each half-hour edition of VICE News Tonight will feature the unique brand of intrepid, investigative journalism and hard-hitting storytelling that HBO viewers have grown to expect from VICE in its Friday-night VICE weekly shows. Airing five nights a week, the newscast will break major stories while engaging its audience in an entertaining and provocative way. Distinguishing itself from the format of traditional daily TV newscasts, the show has no anchor, and instead utilizes correspondent-reported field pieces, newsmaker interviews and profiles, animation and graphics, and "from-the-desk" reports.  |

Welcome all to the grand opening of Westworld. There will be a Live Episode discussion thread for the show with comments sorted by new created shortly before the premiere. A Post-Episode discussion thread will be created at the show's scheduled end time (about 10:15 PM EST), so just because the thread is not up immediately after the credits roll, don't worry. There may be an official "Quick Questions" thread for users to post in so they don't have to create their own threads.

Keep in mind that discussion about episode previews (and other future information) should be spoiler tagged using the code in the sidebar. You can read the full breakdown of our rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/wiki/rules) or a brief summary [here](https://redd.it/53iprn).

	<DATE> 2016-09-27 00:09:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> # Schedule
The debate is set to begin at 9:00 PM EST. That is approximately 5 hours from the time of this post's creation. It is set to last 90 minutes, with no commercial breaks.

# Format

The debate will be moderated NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt. The debate is set to have 6 segments of 15 minutes each. The first two will focus on "America's Direction", the next two "America's Prosperity", and the last two on "Securing America". The audience has been instructed to remain silent, which means no clapping, booing, etc., making it different from the debates of the primaries. The participants are Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, with no third party candidates on the stage.
# Viewing
The debate will be hosted on a variety of networks, such as ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC and C-SPAN. It will also be streamed online by a variety of sources, such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, as well online streams by some of the aforementioned networks. Basically you shouldn't have trouble finding somewhere to watch it if you look around.

***
Although this is not on-topic for /r/television, it is a massive television event, expected to possibly draw ratings comparable to the Superbowl, which we also hosted a thread for. As such we will be trying a thread for this event, and may possibly host threads for future debates depending on how this goes. User submitted content concerning the debate will be handled on a case-by-case basis, but generally we will allow links discussing the ratings and the performance of the moderator.
