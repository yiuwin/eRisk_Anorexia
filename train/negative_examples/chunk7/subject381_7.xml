	<TEXT> Why do you think the U.S. or the USSR attacked during the cold war?
Neither can win a war with the amount the nuclear weapons each have. Both would be decimated. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hoi3- some questions </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I just figured out the basics of this game, and I have cone to the conclusion that hoi4 is complete shit. I have a few questions about hoi3 that I couldn't figure out myself.

1. How dense should troops be? How many divisions per front line province? For a country like the USSR or Germany.

2. Should I keep reserve divisions behind the front lines if needed to reinforce?

3. What is a good army and division template?

4. As Germany, is making only a small surface fleet with large amounts of submarines a good idea?

5. Are bombers enough to gain control of the English Channel, enough for an invasion?

6. How do supplies work?
