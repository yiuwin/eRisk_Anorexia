	<TEXT> Reading this, it makes a lot more sense. I always sensed a kind of tension with mignola on the movies.

"Del Toro didnt think twice about making all those changes to the character for the film. It was only when the film was about to come out that he started saying, Gee, I wonder if the fans will lynch us. And I said, I just hope they dont lynch me before I can point them in your direction, because that shit wasnt my idea."

I still think he should have gave GDT and Ron a shout out, but I understand why he wasnt totally on board for the third hellboy from gdt </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im a huge fan of monsters im general, vampires especially. Blood and Wine is one of my favourite vampire stories in all of fiction. The vampires are very threatening and more than a match for witchers. And that amazing siege....wow.

I just love how this game treated vampires in general. Whos with me? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didnt say it was a bad game. And you could only unlock things if you were online. Dont know if they patch it. And if most people were ok with it, then it would have sold better. Id be a lot didnt buy it for those things </TEXT>
