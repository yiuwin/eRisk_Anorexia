	<TEXT> I am not justifying them. It is quite obvious what they did and what their intentions were. I don't think being innocent and naive would be their case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, maybe I didn't quite explain myself. To begin with, I'm argentine. You are too very probably. I'm not saying that acting like dicks is ok, that is why I say that they "knew the risks" of what they were doing. Bitching around saying "oh these brute argentines are assholes" is not quite acueste on their side, but I'm focusing on us now. The Malvinas war was no different than any other war. Many argentine soldiers died (649 soldiers to be exact) but again, you probably already know this. Is it tragical? Yes. But it happened more than 30 years ago. Humor about tragical things is very common in us humans especially in places like Reddit, don't lie to yourself; The Nazis, 9/11, etc. The fact that they got attacked for making humor out of something tragic is not deserved in my opinion, because then events like "je suis Charlie" should be justified with the same explanation; "they deserved it". And solving conflicts with violence is simply not the way to behave in my opinion.  </TEXT>
