	<TEXT> None of those names jump out at me, besides Mysterio, Spider-Woman and Prowler, and out of those 3, I'm likely to only get Mysterio.

Actually, another name does jump out at me... Gwenpool, and it's not because I want one. </TEXT>

I don't like her chances of seeing a second season on the show, but maybe they'll decide to keep her and give her time because they're bound to lose some senior talent sooner or later. BM and VB are the last members remaining from when I started watching  the show beside KT of course. Plus, I could see Kate leaving soon to start a  big time movie star career. </TEXT>

Bad sculpts, poor articulation, bad paint. This is why Mattel is to be avoided. And often times those publicity shots I linked are the best these figures can look. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Step One, and this is important: **AVOID MATTEL AT ALL COSTS**

Now that we've got that outta the way...

If you want affordable action figures, you should check out Marvel Legends and DC Icons. 

DC Icons have their detractors but the figures are miles better than the garbage Mattel pisses out. You can find these on Amazon, and comic shops.

Marvel Legends are basically everywhere.

If you wanna go a little more expensive, check out SH Figuarts. These figures offer better likeness and superior articulation. 

And if you wanna go even more expensive, check out Hot Toys. They basically exist only to pump out high quality Marvel, Star Wars, and DC, and occasionally some other licenses. 1/6 scale (12 inch) figures. Be warned, these are $200+ most of the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a fan of the movie figures, (I buy Hot Toys for that) so I'd go with ANAD Spidey. I like the Pizza Spidey mold, though it's not without it's flaws.

If you want maximum articulation, I suggest you consider getting the SH Figuarts Homecoming Spider-Man. Amazon will likely have some of the standard release for about $50 about a month after it releases in Asia, and it's only $10 more than you'd spend on one of the ML two packs. </TEXT>

 I don't think you even need pliers to do it. Just place the hand with the broken bit in it, and squeeze the end that covers the wrist joint, and pull. That's how I did it. 

No matter how you approach it, just be careful with the sleeve, of course. </TEXT>

Star Ace does an abysmal job of advertising that they've got the rights to make 1/6 Harry Potter figures, so this might be news to some of you.
I'm really looking forward to getting this figure, big Harry Potter fan here.
EDIT: These are literally the only pictures of the final figure, by the way. It's been out for about 2 weeks judging by ebay auctions. Michael's got a great scoop here.

EDIT: I posted this in r/actionfigures, and I forgot to edit it.

And I guess Harry Potter collectibles aren't a cool thing to post in r/HarryPotter, judging by the down votes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh, that doesn't mean they can't recast the part. 

To be honest, just based off the name I had no idea she was a recurring character until Kate showed up. I was expecting Melissa, based on the character's name.

I guess I shouldn't expect too much from the show that had Fred Armisen play Obama as long as he did, when Jay Pharoah was literally right there.

Here's the first thing that comes up if you Google it:
