	<TEXT> my ex did this! and pictures of himself with a noose roundhis neck. I called 999, the paramedics told his parents to keep an eye on him. This was three years ago and in the summer he tried to finger me in the park and then cried when I reminded him about his girlfriend and the fact that it was daylight and he had followed me there...

 Why do guys do this !? What does it mean? </TEXT>
