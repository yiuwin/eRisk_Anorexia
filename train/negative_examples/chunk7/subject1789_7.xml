	<TEXT> I'm assuming you didn't see that I used words like typically and usually. Neither are saying it's sure fire that it's the next release. 

Also, why are you getting your panties in such a twist over the fact someone posted a new link to a song? Honestly, just enjoy the song.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Typically Spotify links are for showing a song is coming, not for the real deal, as plenty of people don't have premium, so they can't listen to the track right away. Also, you even put the [Spotify] in your title, which is usually how tracks that aren't released but about to be are shown here.  </TEXT>
