	<TEXT> I got a microsoft surface 3 (i7 8gb/256gb) for Christmas and I love it! Just two things concern me- battery life and over heating. I've heard great things about the battery life, but while I'm using it I seem to get only around 2-4 hours out of it. Is this normal? I'm sometimes coding, and occasionally gaming on it. I  read somewhere that the first week is full of updates that drain battery, is this true? 
Finally, the back, top right corner gets hot/loud sometimes. It is usually when I doing something like gaming, but I still was curious as to if it normally gets that hot.
Thanks in advance! </TEXT>
