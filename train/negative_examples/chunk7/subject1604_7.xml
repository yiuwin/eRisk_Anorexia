	<TEXT> Hello, 
    I'm using the extended timeline mod. Say I take part of or all of england with France, is there any way with a mod or otherwise, that I could release mercia or wessex or whatever even though those nations have lost their core by this point in the game ? 
    In victoria II you could release nations and I don't think their cores expired. Given this is a mod of a game that spans a longer period. 


Countries have cores, but the core or I think it might be the region/state that their capital is in is another type of core I think ? It doesn't expire after 50 odd years. 


Would making these "capital" cores permanent over the long course of the mod create too many rebels ? 



Thanks !  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, 
    I've installed RSII to my steam folder for rome: total war alexander, I have the gold edition. All three base games, rome, BI and ALX, run fine. 
    I installed the RSII 2.5 patch to a new folder on my desktop, copied the files into the alexander folder in my steam common folder and made sure the launch options in steam were set to launch properly with the mod. 
    When the mod is launched by running Alexander through steam the game runs and I select a new RSII campaign but while it's loading it crashes. Generic error message, "rome ... exe ... stopped working ... ". 
    Any ideas ? 


Thanks ! 



Edit: Tried again and once my computer began running properly after being frozen from the game crashing, I selected the debug option, and the window read " An unhandled win32 exception occurred in testappa.exe [9822B] " 

Hope that helps.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Running latest patch, using extended timeline, Baroque music, French and prussian unit models, and carthago universalis map mods, I can play and autosave creates a file though after ten years in game saves do not work. It seems to be working and then when I exit to menu or restart the game there is no save. 


Any ideas ? 


Thanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Running latest patch, extended timeline, french units 1.17, orbis terrarum carthago, all cosmetic except timeline. I can't save manually. Some autosaves work but I just tried saving on the cloud with my japanese game and it crashed. The last save was in 1390 ish and I crashed at 1470 ish. Manual saves look like they work but when I try to save again they aren't there under previous saved games. 


Any ideas ?
