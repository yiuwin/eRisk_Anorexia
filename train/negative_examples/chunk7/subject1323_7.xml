	<TEXT> I go through the BBC frontpage as one of the first things in the morning. The story's title did not have anything about the rape accusation originally. It was just "I acted as a man to get a job". I didn't bother reading it. Later in the afternoon the title was what it is now, I was like "no, fucking way". I read it. Fantastic story about that woman's life and a happy conclusion too, so far. I guess the new title works.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> World War Z. They could make it into a nice long series that covers the whole process, from breakout to recovery. The way the book goes, though, its just not possible to do it in one film </TEXT>
