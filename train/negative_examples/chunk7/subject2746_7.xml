	<TEXT> Well, sure, that was my best guess.  But it seems like they can invest in only so many original shows before they outpace their subscriber base.  That business model is  . . . interesting.

But hey, I'm a huge fan of several of their series, so I for one hope they keep attracting more and more subscribers. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do popular series like STRANGER THINGS and DAREDEVIL make money, without commercial advertisements? Is their value simply in attracting new customers? These shows are expensive to make. Can new subscribers alone pay those costs? [ALL] </TITLE>

	<TITLE> I'm confused: If MS is removing Lumias from stores and not mentioning Mobile in ads or at expos, why do we enjoy such frequent updates to the OS? The Fast Ring is regularly updated, yet the devices themselves are clearly being allowed to die. What is going on? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The starkest, strangest, and spookiest thriller you'll read this year:  FACE BLIND.  Apparently there is medical disorder that makes it impossible to identify faces.  The hero has seen the killer face-to-face but can't recognize him.
