	<TEXT> This poem was written on the painting before the background was put in:

This painting is a prayer.
I will forget, let me remember.
Help me see the ever present stillness
when I am blinded by chaos.
I will be mindful.
Let me be humble.
Let me be kind.
Let me come into spirit.
Let me feel deeply.
Give me strength
to survive the illusion.
Let me penetrate the material.
Let me know the riches
of my own heart.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a silk screen design on thin cotton rather than a high res sublimated print on polyester. Basically they cost way less to make. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It represents me coming out of a spiritual and creative block into a new chapter of abundance. Earlier in the painting I had written this poem: 

This painting is a prayer.
I will forget, let me remember.
Help me see the ever present stillness
when I am blinded by chaos.
I will be mindful.
Let me be humble.
Let me be kind.
Let me come into spirit.
Let me feel deeply.

to survive the illusion.

Let me know the riches
of my own heart.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! No I haven't seen or read that book. The Phoenix represents to me creative and spiritual rebirth. A burning away of that which doesn't serve me, a death to an old self, and a sparking of new creative energy. </TEXT>
