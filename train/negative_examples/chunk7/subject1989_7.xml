	<TEXT> The United States is one of the select places on God's green earth where service is a choice. I think the people that make that choice deserve more than what they get, regardless of their motivations. I was simply and non-judgmentally curious about those motivations. I can't pretend to understand where some come from when they do stuff like get offended or downvote so what's the use in getting offended myself?

Now, I remember a few years ago, some action movie staring Tom Cruise and a gun (maybe Jack Reacher, I don't remember) came out and in it, something stuck with me that I had always wanted to believe was true just because it sounded about right and this is me looking for confirmation. Someone in the movie says something to the effect of "There are 4 types of people that join the armed forces; those that do it for love of country, those that do it because it's a family tradition, those that have few career options otherwise, and those that just want to put some bullets in some bad guys" Is that true? Recognizing that it might be a gross oversimplification, is that something that any service member can speak to and confirm? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not the best story teller in the world, but here it goes.  



2 years ago and some change, the first death in my immediate family occurred that I can remember. It was awkward and hard time for me to be dealing with that. I am not the youngest in my generation of my family but I was looking at the youngest, old enough to comprehend it and be hurt by the loss, thinking I had a responsibility to be his rock. That pressure was almost as hard as the loss itself. One of the things I was able to do was talk with a grievance counselor. We talked about the whole situation and the last time we talked, he posed 3 questions of me that I didn't have answers for. I was in a parking lot, sitting in my parked car when I got off the phone with him so I quickly jumped out and wrote those questions down on a corner of paper, tore it off, folded it, and put it in my wallet. That paper remains in there with me to this very moment and I sometimes do go back and ponder how my answers may have changed to those questions. Those questions are as follows.

What are the consequences of driving in the snow? I'm a relatively young driver. I've put thousands of miles in on the road but not on snow days. I noticed that when I break and lose traction, that the pedal jirates, the car slides, and the sound I'm hearing is almost that of the snow being crunched up under my tires as I slide but much louder than I would expect.

	<DATE> 2017-01-03 10:02:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Dearest creature in creation,  
Study English pronunciation.  
I will teach you in my verse  
Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse.  
I will keep you, Suzy, busy,  
Make your head with heat grow dizzy.  
Tear in eye, your dress will tear.  
So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.  
Just compare heart, beard, and heard,  
Dies and diet, lord and word,  
Sword and sward, retain and Britain.  
(Mind the latter, how its written.)  
Now I surely will not plague you  
With such words as plaque and ague.  
But be careful how you speak:  
Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;  
Cloven, oven, how and low,  
Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.  
Hear me say, devoid of trickery,  
Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore,  
Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,  
Exiles, similes, and reviles;  
Scholar, vicar, and cigar,  
Solar, mica, war and far;  
One, anemone, Balmoral,  
Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;  
Gertrude, German, wind and mind,  
Scene, Melpomene, mankind.  
Billet does not rhyme with ballet,  
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.  
Blood and flood are not like food,  
Nor is mould like should and would.  
Viscous, viscount, load and broad,  
Toward, to forward, to reward.  
And your pronunciations OK  
When you correctly say croquet,  
Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,  
Friend and fiend, alive and live.  
Ivy, privy, famous; clamour  
And enamour rhyme with hammer.  
River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb,  
Doll and roll and some and home.  
Stranger does not rhyme with anger,  
Neither does devour with clangour.  
Souls but foul, haunt but aunt,  
Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant,  
Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger,  
And then singer, ginger, linger,  
Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge,  
Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.  
Query does not rhyme with very,  
Nor does fury sound like bury.  
Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth.  
Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath.  
Though the differences seem little,  
We say actual but victual.  
Refer does not rhyme with deafer.  
Fe0ffer does, and zephyr, heifer.  
Mint, pint, senate and sedate;  
Dull, bull, and George ate late.  
Scenic, Arabic, Pacific,  
Science, conscience, scientific.  
Liberty, library, heave and heaven,  
Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven.  
We say hallowed, but allowed,  
People, leopard, towed, but vowed.  
Mark the differences, moreover,  
Between mover, cover, clover;  
Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,  
Chalice, but police and lice;  
Camel, constable, unstable,  
Principle, disciple, label.  
Petal, panel, and canal,  
Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal.  
Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,  
Senator, spectator, mayor.  
Tour, but our and succour, four.  
Gas, alas, and Arkansas.  
Sea, idea, Korea, area,  
Psalm, Maria, but malaria.  
Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean.  
Doctrine, turpentine, marine.  
Compare alien with Italian,  
Dandelion and battalion.  
Sally with ally, yea, ye,  
Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.  
Say aver, but ever, fever,  
Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver.  
Heron, granary, canary.  
Crevice and device and aerie.  
Face, but preface, not efface.  
Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.  
Large, but target, gin, give, verging,  
Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.  
Ear, but earn and wear and tear  
Do not rhyme with here but ere.  
Seven is right, but so is even,  
Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,  
Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,  
Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.  
Pronunciation (think of Psyche!)  
Is a paling stout and spikey?  
Wont it make you lose your wits,  
Writing groats and saying grits?  
Its a dark abyss or tunnel:  
Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale,  
Islington and Isle of Wight,  
Housewife, verdict and indict.  
Finally, which rhymes with enough,  
Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough?  
Hiccough has the sound of cup.  
My advice is to give up!!!   </TEXT>

An apple a day keeps the doctor away.  
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  
Beggars can't be choosers.  
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  
You have to take the bitter with the sweet.  
Blood is thicker than water.  
Brevity is the soul of whit.  
There's more than one way to skin a cat.  
A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link.  
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  
A man is known by the company he keeps.  
No good deed goes unpunished.  
A dog is a man's best friend.  
The love of money is the root of all evil.  
Good fences make good neighbors.  
There are plenty of fish in the sea.  
You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.  
God helps those who help themselves.  
What's good for the goose is good for the gander.  
Old habits die hard.  
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.  
History repeats itself.  
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.  
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  
Strike the iron while it's hot.  
Laughter is the best medicine.  
The leopard can't change it's spots.  
Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker.  
A jack of all trades is a master of none.  
The meek shall inherit the earth.  
When the cat's away, the mice will play.  
Misery loves company.  
A fool and his money are soon parted.  
Bad news travels fast.  
You can't fit a square peg into a round hole.  
The pen is mightier than the sword.  
A watched pot never boils.  
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  
Revenge is a dish best served cold.  
Rome wasn't build in a day.  
Stop to smell the roses.  
A rolling stone gathers no moss.  
Time heals all wounds.  
Variety is the spice of life.  
All's fair in love and war.  
It's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease.  
A nod is as good as a wink to a blind man.  
Actions speak louder than words.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a hypothetical because I know (or at least have heard) that loading a magazine to full capacity and leaving it like that for a long time can damage the lips and destroy it's ability to retain the ammo. BUT, if you were to load up a magazine to full capacity, and leave it in the gun with an extra round in the chamber, is there any part of the semiautomatic anatomy (either universal or with certain model types) that protects the magazine lips? I imagine especially with the additional round in the chamber, the lip on the mag has nowhere to go and it's structural integrity won't be compromised.  </TEXT>

What had the rebellion been doing all that time if not planning to destroy the death star? 

2) The death star destroys a couple planets in the movie but I was under the impression that destroying Alderaan was the first showcase of it's power. 

3) We get introduced to a lot of planets in Rogue One. Did any of them exist in the Star Wars universe previously?  </TEXT>

112 abra candy

One of my math professors tried to get us to think outside of the 3D box and think of things that could be plotted in 4D space or more. Well this is one of the first times I have been able to picture it mentally. On top of all the sort options that the game actually gives you, like sorting by height, weight, HP, number of candies, number of times seen, number of pokeballs used to capture, number of times caught, or the relative distance between where you caught it and where you currently are. Each one of these metrics could be it's own axis in multi space.  </TEXT>
