	<TEXT> My childhood house. I can easily go to my parents  new house right now and spend the night but it will never feel the same as it did as a kid. So much comfort and safety and happiness. Waking up to the smell of bacon every weekend. Lounging around with my childhood dog. Having no worries. I get a glimpse of that old feeling when I visit them but it quickly goes away. I miss home :/ </TEXT>
