	<TEXT> I feel the same way with my gf. We just celebrated two years and both want to get married soon and I'm proposing soon, but sometimes I feel as though the same love is not there you know? I really don't know what to think. 

Edit: as for his mindset, it might be that he might be getting cold feet or just needs a break. My gf is leaving for a month and I am looking forward to it to see if I can focus on what's going on in my head. I'm sorry this is happening, I hope he figures it out.  </TEXT>
