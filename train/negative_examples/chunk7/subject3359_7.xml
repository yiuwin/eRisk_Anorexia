	<TEXT> The EG line-up could've definitely competed against european teams. 

Dazed probably one of the best IGL and players NA. 
AZK the rock of the team, just like Krimz is for Fnatic. 
Hiko an amazingly skilled player, good caller and lurker. 
Skadoodle a top 3 awper if used well by the IGL. 
Swag a solid rifler and still improving player since he's young.


That line-up would've been stacked as hell. </TEXT>

Also, S1mple has been mainly playing rifle, which Pimp can do as well, so don't discredit him just yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, he made a mistake, but he didn't deserve a lifetime ban considering there were no rules in place at that time and he didn't even get paid any salary back then from his org.

That shit happened 1.5 years ago, he hasn't done anything like that since and I don't think he'd want to risk another life time ban considering he loves competing. What he did shouldn't really be relevant anymore and brought up by everyone, people deserve 2nd chances, and Overwatch is his 2nd chance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly yeah, what I'm doing is getting good at one class of every single role and then specializing in the role I'm the best at. Which for me is the offensive role due to me having good aim and sorta good knowledge and understanding of the maps for flanking. I don't mind switching to support when needed.

It is however frustrating if I constantly have to go support/tank, although I don't really want to. </TEXT>

What is the reason for this exactly? I don't really see the point in it. </TEXT>
