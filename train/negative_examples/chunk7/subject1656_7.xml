	<TEXT> There is nothing wrong with commissioning sketches that you are going to rig yourself. It's not rude at all. Just be sure to tell the artist what you are planning to do with the sketches you commission. The artist will generally give you a price quote and stipulate if they would like to be credited. When I'm commissioned, I generally create a contract with terms and conditions. </TEXT>
