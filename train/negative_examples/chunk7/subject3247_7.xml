	<TEXT> Between 5 and 10 is fine. Just so long as the sprite sheet is less than 500k when converted down. 

 nbsp;

-----------------------------------------------

 nbsp;

I use these sites to make them:

 nbsp;

[EZGif](https://ezgif.com/) Resize gift to about 300x300 give or take

I also use it split the gif into seperate frames. 

 nbsp;

Then I use [Instant Sprite](https://instantsprite.com/) to create the sprite sheet with offset of 0 (zero). 

 nbsp;

Then after the sprite sheet is created I try using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress it down to 500k. 

 nbsp;

Then upload and create the CSS "gif" on the sidebar. 

:)

	<TEXT> **Black Garden**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 nbsp;


**T**hey have blossomed from the lands of death, 


These flowers which a long-wrought dream has poured


With ashes and the unearthly vapor


Of a bed of night iris shedding petals


One by one, like the hours of darkness, 


Through the black water. The slow diamonds


Of the luminous hour glittered, strange 


Illumination of a capsized sun. 


The lilies have squandered the whole dark horde


of the lovely garden pounded by the sea


And the hardened metal of your sacred columns


Has trembled, O stems. Behold the night, offering


The Key that opens wide her gates of horn


To the emanations of delivered souls. 

 nbsp;


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's all we ask. 

I've been in this post all day and will all night. I have a cold so I'm not going anywhere. 

And my best RP guy friend brought me my favourite chicken soup from my favourite mexican restaurant so I'm feeling a little better.  </TEXT>
