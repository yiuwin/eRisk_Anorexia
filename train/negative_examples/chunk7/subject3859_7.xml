	<TEXT> I found inspiration from Impressionism and there are a lot of different techniques being used. I started with thin layers, scumbling, build up enough layers and then used a palette knife to lay down paint too. I'm continuing to glaze over the layers to add color depth and shine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sea-salt ice cream is a type of ice cream found in Twilight Town and Radiant Garden. It appears throughout the Kingdom Hearts universe, but made its first appearance in Kingdom Hearts II. The ice cream's flavor mixes both a salty taste and a sweet taste.

An interview with Tetsuya Nomura after Kingdom Hearts II explained that Nomura first tasted sea-salt ice cream at a trip to Tokyo DisneySea, a smaller resort of Disney's parks in Japan. He liked the ice cream very much and decided to work with Disney to have it put into Kingdom Hearts II. He also said that the idea to put the dessert into the game came to him when he was thinking about what the kids in Twilight Town do and eat over summer vacation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny story. I had a canvas laying around that I had tried to multiple acrylic paintings on. All paintings had failed and I saw it today. I thought well, shit might as well try  paint something over abstract chaos.  I took burnt umber in oils and just did the outline of sora. Thats the process so far. Everything in the back ground is multiple attempts at different paintings.  This is merely the foundation however. I plan to go in and actually build it to a high level of rendering , etc. Going To Tone Down THE Chaos With A light blue layer so all the focus goes on to sora and the line work.

	<TEXT> :,) I don't know where to start. I just uploaded it and ran to the gym to come back to all these beautiful comments. Thank you and everyone else as well for not only viewing my painting, but reading between the wrinkles to understand the anguish, sorrows, and joys that my grandmother must have seen. It's amazing how we can all relate to a portrait of a specific person. The technical/accuracy is only there to provide grounding to the subtle emotion and expression that is being communicated. I've stayed up for the past few weeks day and night to complete this and it feels like the weight has just been lifted. It's my first "finished" painting and I'm so happy to share it with you all.  Thank you so much everyone for being a part of this.

 ah I wish I could sell it but I made it for my personal portfolio. I can always make you another soon(on my way to India right now).  If you would like to buy a print of it however, hover above the image on my site and the option will come up. Otherwise, I will make you something after my trip, keep in touch! and Thank you.
