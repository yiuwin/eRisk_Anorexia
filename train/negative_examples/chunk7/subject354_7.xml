	<TEXT> I wonder if they'll incorporate a repayment method. A read somewhere that there should be a system in place where, say the basic income is 100 a week. If you are still working you pay a certain percentage (like tax) on everything you earn up until you surpass the "debt" of 100 each week. So if I earned 200 a week and I was taxed 50%. I would still have 200 by the end. Then everything I earn after that is mine. I think this would be good because it turns universal income into a safety net rather than a "get out" </TEXT>
