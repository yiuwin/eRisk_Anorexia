	<TITLE> Why go surgical and silent ? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-02 11:17:03 </DATE>

	<TEXT> There is no incentive in this game to be silent or surgical, meaning only killing targets, except the fact that you're likely to get a challenge or two and guards can kill you far easier than in previous games. 


Edit: replied to all comments with the same thing to get you to come back and reply. I don't understand how you can't see my point. The cameras mean nothing unless you're going for a "highscore" on the leaderboard - which ultimately is pointless. You gain the same amount of XP for unlocks whether you leave evidence or not. 
  

    The newspaper/notoriety system from blood money was a was of ensuring that people were silent and surgical, otherwise they would be spotted through disguises in worst case scenarios due to newspaper exposure/witnesses.

	<TEXT> Each castle has a kennel master, the same way that they have cooks, maids, stable boys, etc - they're all part of that place. Ramsay met the girl when he was young, at the dread fort. Meaning her father was kennel master at the dread fort. Likely his father was before him. There is nothing to suggest he has moved from there. 
    Also, there is no "army". If a war is to be fought, banners are called. An army is assembled. In the same way, if dogs are required then they are brought from the nearest place as are the soldiers.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Phrase "I miss you" help ? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-02 21:17:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know Tu me manques means I miss you. But I don't understand why it isn't me tu manques. The phrase "nous lui donnons de la bire" means we gave him/her beer. I imagine that the two parts before the verb are split and the verb goes in the middle. As in, "nous lui donnons" becomes "nous donnons lui" - "we gave him". This is how I imagined it to work though in this case it's the other way around. (i) "Tu me manques" becomes (ii) "Tu manques me" - "you miss me" when(ii) should be "Me manques tu" - "I miss you" 
    So instead of putting the verb in the middle of the two "arguments" beforehand, the "arguments" are swapped and then it's put in. 
    Can any of you make sense of this ? I know I'm rambling. 

    Thanks. </TEXT>
