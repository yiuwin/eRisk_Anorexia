	<TEXT> I'll try it, I was under the impression an odex'ed system prevented me from pulling this off though?

Edit: Found the icon and deleted it- no SystemUI crashes yet. Thanks /u/KillerBeeSting </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone with an Android Wear device has the option of silencing your phone and having the watch vibrate on ring- I would love to get rid of that silent icon (as I have my watch on ~90% of the time) I have scoured here and XDA but can't find a solution. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This really sucks. I own the first gen Sony Blu-Ray GTV box and have never made a better investment for my TV. I updated the Youtube for Google TV app the other day and immediately went back to the older version because the new one is awful. The app still works perfectly as of this morning though, so we'll see. </TEXT>
