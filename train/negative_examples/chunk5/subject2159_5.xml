	<TEXT> As I'm sure many people know, ranked can be a very frustrating experience and most of this comes from the lack teamwork. This is a team based game and when you take this away, I lose the will to play. It's why I couldn't bear the grind this season even while performing moderately well. 

MM needs to allow division of 2, imo and it can match so both teams have the same amount of divisions. This will ensure that there is at least some semblance of teamwork guaranteed and you can at least play with friends for the hundreds of ranked battles required for rank 1. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're exaggerating a bit. TW3 went through heavy engine upgrades to support open world and that, even with the time to build the initial engine, didn't take 8-10 years with game development. And of course Bethesda could just use a pre-built engine. They're not the most technical devs.

Edit - no reason this should be downvoted other than confirmation bias. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean it's all the same everywhere. Sometimes you win, sometimes potato teammates bring you down, sometimes MM does something funky (not often though from my experience over 3 ranked seasons). These are problems not exclusive to ranked. 

My past ranked experiences have been pretty good at 65% winrate throughout.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Atago has less damage potential that Mogami as it has a slower reload. 

Kutuzov has the same accuracy as Chap, gets smoke but Chap has excellent radar which is very useful in pubs and better detection.

Tirptiz armor layout works against itself a lot and dies to HE spam faster than anything given its poor deck armor. 

People often misinterpret what OP means. Strong ships are not OP. Ships that have little to no counter potential to them are OP, which is why DDs have been nerfed over and over. </TEXT>
