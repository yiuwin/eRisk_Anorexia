	<TEXT> I try very hard to be even handed here, and correction when warranted based on context of comments. Because I am always willing to learn something new, and discuss it in a polite manner. 

It only seems fair to be like this. I'd like to earn the users respect and have them feel they can openly discuss issues if they are within the rules of the sub. 

And no, I don't get paid. I do all this for free, fun, and to make Reddit a better place for all views.

	<TEXT> Yes, I know that XXY, and XO etc. exist, but for the purpose of explaining what the word sex means *besides* "sexual intercourse" I wanted to stick to the two most common variations. 

The fact that other variations exist has nothing to do with this distinction.

 nbsp;

I don't think you understand the meaning of the word "sex" in this context.
Sex does not have to refer to sexual intercourse, it can also be the biological sex of a child i.e. is it a male or female child, XY or XX-chromosomes, does it have a penis or a vagina?

 nbsp;

Orgasms have nothing to do with this! Why would orgsams have anything to do with wether your genes are those of a male or female human??? (or anything in between)

You just contradicted yourself. 

Physical sex means you can have a penis or vagina, or both. 

Chromosomal sex can also vary, as I linked. 

You can change your sex, and your gender. And Intersexed people should be given a chance to decide. Just like they know at a certain age, so do transgender people. 

Also, a transgender/transsexual person does not have to change their bits to have sex, or change their gender. Some do, others do not. Some go on hormones, others do not. 

They define who they are. Sex, Sex (intercouse) and Gender are not related. 

Now I'm confusing myself. 

Sex and Gender are not related.  </TEXT>

But the topic was sex and gender are not related. The other user stated they were. 

I made a different point to their argument. That is all. 

I basically stated sex is between the ears, not the legs, by using the point that an orgasm happens between the ears before between the legs.

	<TEXT> Well, if you are saying because I was born with a penis I won't disagree there. I understand that. 

Gender is not the identity of sex, after a certain point, self-realization   self-determination kick in. 

However, there are also people born with both sexes (intersex) and they should be given a choice to decide what gender, or no gender, they choose to live throughout their life. 

So, it is complicated. Agreed?

	<TEXT> 
 Why is it a null point? Girls are less likely to go into STEM, the fact that I know a dozen women in STEM does not make that a null point. It's statistics. Boys, on average, spend much more time playing 3D action video games and with certain toys. This makes them better at spatial reasoning. When girls play 3D action video games, the gap in spatial reasoning disappears.pdf). My point is that things that appear to be sexual dimorphism can disappear with a few hours of doing a new task, meaning that certain structural differences are related to tasks and not innate sex differences. Girls are on average less skilled in 3D video games because they play them less. Statistics. This doesn't mean that individual girls can't be better than individual boys at video games. If they played them more, they would as a group be just as adept as boys are, their brains would change as a result. Girls do not suddenly have boy brains once their spatial reasoning approaches "boy" levels.

I know many girls who have played video games since they could hold a phone. Still a null point. You are gender defining video games, which is not the right thing to do. 

Women also have been known to be equal to men in STEM, when given the chance and encouraged. Much as men have proven to be great chefs. Learned skills and aptitude should not be a reasoning point.


 If you were to read a general book on how the brain works this might make more sense. You can't act as an authority on a very specific subset of brain differences without having a more basic understanding of the brain.

Neither can you. 


 My argument is that they are. Your was that you believe fMRI is unreliable, when many studies prove differently. Along with dissection. Choose to read it how you want, same as I do.
 The link you posted about the dissection differences even said that these differences are not the cause of dysphoria. They show up after dysphoria already exists. This means it's not due to being born with a "female brain", it's something that shows up as a result of dysphoria. It says so right in your source. The majority of fMRI studies have dubious results, if you choose to believe them that is wishful thinking, not science.

My gender was known to me at an early age. When do you think dysphoria sets in? Puberty? Late in life? No, we Trans people know same as others, at a very young age. 

 I choose both, based on my interpretation of the data presented. You choose to ignore it and go with limited studies you also provided.
 The brains vary, and it's evidence I will continue to provide.


 You're the one who posted limited, flawed studies. I'm saying that the evidence doesn't exist yet.

You posted limited studies too. I posted pages and links to pages, similar to you. Each one proves our respective point. 


 Maybe make it a pet cause to push the race sex narrative as well. The evidence is exactly the same.

This comment is striking me as a whistle towards trans-racial meme. 


 Personality does not effect the brain any more or less, despite what you showed. My daughters could kick your ass at video games. My female cousins could teach you how to hunt, fish, and prep deer, along with what gravy goes good with squirrel meat.


 What??? Personality is in the brain. If you're talking about actions, it's not up for debate, there is a consensus that actions affect brain structure. I was not claiming that girls can't play video games or participate in non-traditional activities. My point is that they're fully capable of it, that they can do anything they want to but social pressures mean certain areas of the brain are on average differently developed. If you're discouraged from taking math classes you will show deficits in parts of the brain dealing with math. This does not say anything about what sex you are. A man who is unusually empathetic is not a woman, he is an empathetic man, even if his brain scan appears female.

You are back peddling and double talking. What you posted was that our hobbies and pleasures make us more brain male or female. I'm stating that I understand what you provided, but I disagree, because I know plenty of people with different hobbies that are traditionally one gender or the other. It's not a factor in being Trans. You like what you like. 

Here is your own comment:

So it's not a fixed difference, **it's a result of a change in behavior**. Obviously our actions influence our brain. If you expose yourself to certain stimuli your brain will change in response. This appears to be what's happening, **adults who wish they were the opposite sex perform tasks stereotypically associated with the opposite sex, and their brain responds.** Meaning there's probably nothing innately "female" or "male" about these structural changes. Take for example how there is nothing innately male about being able to do math well, but if you only taught boys math, the areas of the brain associated with doing math would appear different in boys/men and girls/women. **Add to that if girls who believed they were boys started dressing up as boys and doing stereotypically male things like doing math and science, their brains would appear to have changed "sex" if we looked at certain parts of the brain.**

 nbsp;

[Ok, what do you make of this?](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/12/the-astonishing-village-where-little-girls-turn-into-boys-aged-1/)

[Of course, there is also the opposite](http://www.gq.com/story/burrnesha-albanian-women-living-as-men) which is very interesting.

	<TEXT>  I'm not attacking you personally, I'm criticizing the scientific claims you're making. If that hurts your feelings you need to either develop a thicker skin or stop making scientific claims.

I have a very thick skin, and open mind. 

 If a stereotype encourages a group to perform actions, their brain will begin to deviate from the norm in a measurable way. Boys, for example, are much more likely to play video games than girls, so they're better at spatial reasoning. Research has found that if girls are made to play video games for a few hours a week for a couple of months, the sex gap in spatial reasoning disappears.

Many of my girlfriends have played video games their whole lives, this is a null point. 

I don't really care what you do with your body. I care when people make claims of brains being sexed when from everything I've ever read, there is no conclusive evidence for it. Brain research is at a very primitive level. All these claims do is cause a divide between the sexes.

My argument is that they are. Your was that you believe fMRI is unreliable, when many studies prove differently. Along with dissection. Choose to read it how you want, same as I do. 

It shouldn't affect the transgender movement, you can still take hormones, change your pronouns, have people treat you as the opposite sex, and choose to live your life as you wish without claiming you have the brain of the opposite sex. Instead of pushing the "brain sex" narrative transgender people should be pushing the "don't be an asshole about how I choose to live my life" narrative. Because people who give you shit about how you present yourself are just being assholes. They're the enemies, not the people who point out that the evidence for brain sex is inconclusive.


I choose both, based on my interpretation of the data presented. You choose to ignore it and go with limited studies you also provided. 

The brains vary, and it's evidence I will continue to provide. 

Personality does not effect the brain any more or less, despite what you showed. My daughters could kick your ass at video games. My female cousins could teach you how to hunt, fish, and prep deer, along with what gravy goes good with squirrel meat. 

You were furthering your agenda by presenting things you believe, I was doing the same. I believe there are differences in Trans peoples brains, and have proved my point. Just as you believe you have proved yours. I don't believe your little argument that doing certain social things listed changes the brain of anyone, except it increases their interest in that part of their brain, and that is neither male nor female. 

Lets just choose to disagree and you believe your facts as you see fit, and I'll believe my facts as I see fit.  </TEXT>

Add to that if girls who believed they were boys started dressing up as boys and doing stereotypically male things like doing math and science, their brains would appear to have changed "sex" if we looked at certain parts of the brain.

It's hard to define those things though. Is a gay male giving head doing something feminine? When I work on a car or electronics is that doing something masculine? What about when I cook? Do the laundry? I wear jeans and sweatshirts a lot, rarely dresses, but I do love dresses. How does that effect my brain? I love getting my mani-pedi, does that effect me? I have a 1970 Chevelle and a 1981 Jeep CJ8. I've worked on both, does that make me masculine? I mostly suck at math and find it fascinating and boring at the same time. I love to read, music, and am not turned on by visual stimuli. Does that make me more female? 

I prefer to think those things are just part of my personality. My sex was not my choice, nor was my mental gender. Something is wrong, but I want to fix it in a way that keeps me sane, and fuck all what others think. This is my life, my body, my time here on Earth and in this reality. This is what I choose, and I don't think anyone else has the right to force their beliefs upon me. I don't go out of my way to do it to them. I'm 90% stealth, to the point that old co-workers didn't know for years until a random FB post told them. It's not a big part of my life that I go out of my way to tell people. I had more problems "passing" as a male, and zero problems living as a woman. Nothing like being a male and being stopped from going into the men's restroom, even when I had short hair, let alone when I grew it long. 

There are so many variables. I think we should just be respectful and not set out to hurt each other. Like I said - I don't go and shit in your lawn, please don't come in mine and do the same. If you want to learn than do so in a respectful manner. I read a lot of subs, but rarely comment. Today set me off on a level I've not unleashed in a long time. 

Because I've always known I was female, and I don't need people telling me my feelings and thoughts are invalid.  </TEXT>

I understand exactly what you are saying. 

FYI - I wish I'd been born in such a time as now, so I could have transitioned earlier. I fully hated puberty.

And no, if given a "pill" to be normal I would refuse. I am normal. This is who I am and how God made me, or how nature screwed me, whichever you believe in. I don't hurt anyone and try really hard to be understanding everyday. 

I'd much rather lift someone up, than tear them down. And sometimes I fail at that, because I refuse to not stand up for myself, others, and friends. Especially male friends given shit for being CIS WHITE HETRO. 

Thank you again!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best "outreach" program for a trans child is acceptance and helping them transition. Puberty only makes the feelings of gender dysphoria even worse. Blocking puberty is a small stop gap to allow further reflection and decision making by the child. 

Transitioning at puberty, after this reflection, and if it is agreed upon by all parties it directly affects (meaning *not people like you*) is the optimal correction. 

But after reading your ranting all day I get the impression you would rather trans people suffer to make you feel better and right. People like you are why we often choose suicide, because all you do is inflict pain upon us.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol. You're saying that because you weren't offered hormones as a kid it caused you depression and anxiety and suicide attempts.

My first suicide attempt was at 14, but nobody knew because I pulled through it. 

Did you come out to your parents about this? Were they supportive? Were you bullied? There are a million other factors here.

My parents knew I was bullied in school since the start of school. Luckily my Dad taught me to fight, and I did. I actually enjoyed the few fist fights I had, along with kicking a boy down the stairs for putting gum in my long hair and calling me a Faggot. Me and that boy latter became great friends, and pen palled though out my Navy Career. 


You are simplify it in favor of your view, rather than looking at this from a scientific point of a view.

You are doing this, and I am partially doing this from personal experience, as you stated, and facts. It helps the child. People like you only like to hurt them, because you can't wrap your head around the fact that Trans kids **know** from a young age that we should have been born in a different body. We know, just like Lesbian/Gay and Straight people know. Who are *you* to tell us we do not know our own minds?


There needs to be a better support structure for kids and parents, rather than jumping to fucking with your biology so young.

No, there does not, because this is what is already in place, and it is proven effective for us. I guess your would like for us to have aversion therapy? Shock treatment? Being told repeatedly our feelings do not matter because you and others can't figure out that what we say about ourselves is true? 

When did you know you were straight? I don't see an ally flag or anything else on your flair, so I am just guessing here. Sorry if you are not straight, didn't mean to offend.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Based on your views I should have continued to be *tortured* because you *feel* it is right. But I was the one with the **feelings** and knew my body and mind. 

Thanks for wishing me and every other Trans child pain. You will **never** change my mind on what is right, because you have no experience being trans.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, when I joined the NAVY at 17, because that is the earliest I could join, was I too young to know what I was doing? 

I knew at 4 I wanted to be a girl. I knew in kindergarten when other girls came up to me and asked if I was a girl and said that I was too pretty to be a boy that something was wrong. I knew. But I was forced to live a lie, and that still bothers me after all these years.

	<TEXT> You are so wrong. Puberty without blockers is HELL. Your body continues to change into something even more foreign to your mind. It causes severe depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts that are often acted upon. 

I know, I hated puberty, and if at 13 I were offered blockers I would have gobbled them up. If I were offered female hormone replacement therapy at 13 I would have taken them immediately, and not put myself through years and years of depression and suicide attempts. I never looked like a male to begin with, why torture myself even *more because someone like you "thinks it is wrong"? 

It's their body, and along with being informed by doctors and psychiatrist and talking with their parents they should be fully allowed to make such a decision. Without input from people like you. 

 Edit - * dropped a word.  </TEXT>
