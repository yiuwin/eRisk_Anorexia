	<TEXT> It's about getting votes that are worth the trouble.  Would it be nice to win with 100% of the vote?  Yeah, that'd be awesome.  But is that at all realistic?  No.  Many voters wouldn't vote for the Democratic candidate if you paid them.  So, given limited time and resources, you should try to sway voters that are likely to be swayed.

Some idiot who thinks the Democratic Party hates white men isn't likely to be swayed, so why bother?  How could the Democratic Party show you they want your vote and convince you to vote for them, *and*, this is important, *without* alienating their current base who *do* actually vote for them already? </TEXT>
