	<TEXT> I was asked about this in the Terence Mckenna sub. i said "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN-vMMpja30[1]   Ive done a few shirts with different people and the quotes I use are really obscure cus it seperates the men from the boys of fandom. I used that quote in particular mainly because it was an in joke with my friends and I from when i didnt like mckenna. i thought that line was particularly ridiculous" </TEXT>
