	<TEXT> The whole "doctoral thesis" aspect is part of what intrigues me.  My full-time job is in academia, so I'm intrigued by the idea of blending that way of thinking with my hobby.  But it's the public-service projects that concern me.  Like most of us, I don't have much free time to dedicate to planting community gardens and lecturing at local clubs.  I do see the value in those things, but I'm somewhat intimidated by them.  Of course, that's years down the road for me, so I'm getting ahead of myself.  At any rate, thanks for your thoughtful response. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The practical exam for the first level sounded deceptively easy to me.  I will take it eventually, though I wonder if I could pass it today, with what I've already learned.  Was it really just as simple as identifying equipment and mites?  Like, this is a brood chamber, this is a medium super, this is a Varroa, et cetera? </TEXT>
