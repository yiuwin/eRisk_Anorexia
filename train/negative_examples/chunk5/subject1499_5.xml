Ramza shout- full break: affliction break

Cait sith toy soldier (reverse wall)- shell and curaga

Faris USB (Pentabreak)- power breakdown, armor breakdown

Some DPS like firon or cloud

Lenna with BSB or aerioth with BSB (protect and ultimate cure)

RW wall </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This guy has the goods. 
Thinking Grabbing cait sith with toy solider reverse wall, and full break with a breakdown sounds dope. Specifically:

Cait sith: full break dance: curaga - toy soldier

Ramza: power breakdown: affliction break - shout

Or instead of Ramza have Faris with same abilities but I have her Hyper break USB. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Regarding breakdowns and such, are they worth it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-29 08:40:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I normally only have support like Larsa who throws down full break for the medals but otherwise ignore breakdowns. However with the increase of bosses who disregard resistance and defense in their attacks I wonder if it's worth to pile breakdowns at the cost of less damage over all from your team. I understand the whole ID system where a mentle breakdown won't stack with a SB that only shreds resistance. 

TLDR: 1. Are multiple breakdowns worth it if you do somewhat less DPS overall. 

2.Is it viable to have 3 supports/dancers/thieves on your team grabbing penta-break, full break, and the others, 1 healer, 1 main DPS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back ground information:

CA, Sacramento. On a high way a 10 car collision was caused by one driver. Driver is at fault after a long insurance investigation. Driver was driving a crappy car and looked on the poor side. Ambulance was called but no one was thankfully injured so it drove away empty.

Insurance: 
 
The guy who caused this has Infinity Insurance Co. and $10,000 liability. Since 2 of the cars in the accident from my perspective were completely totaled and towed away and the extensive damage on the rest, I assume damages will exceed $10,000 by a large margin. 

What should the innocent people who were in the accident do to recoup losses? </TEXT>
