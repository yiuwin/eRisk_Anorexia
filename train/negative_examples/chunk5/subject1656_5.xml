	<TEXT> Hi there, I'd be interested in continuing where your old artist left off. You can see my portfolio http://www.subject1656.com. As you can see, I have my own style I generally work in, but I also have no problem emulating the style of others. Let me know if you're interested. I'd be happy to draw you a sample sketch in your desired style, to help you decide whether you'd want to proceed with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought Lobster Matched my Illustration and the feel I was going for more than any other type I tried, but you're right that it might be too overused. I'll try Escafina and see how it looks. </TEXT>
