	<TEXT> firstly, there's no such thing as going too fast in Skyrim, go at your own pace.

I recommend the dark brotherhood quests, my favourite of the factions (quest line wise)  in skyrim. 

as for 4, you only need to reach ~30 to access everything so you'll be fine, most of that is just the daedric questioned that require high levels. 

5, do as much as you want and only stop and start a new when you feel like it, if at all. the entire experience is up to you.  </TEXT>

I like just going down the road and attacking hosts of imperial and stormcloak soldier. go stealth first, take a shot or two from behind and make sure to be decent with one handed weapons. once they get too close draw your sword, cut them down and then pick the rest of them off with your bow. it's a fun way to role play a raider in my opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What ever you do, not play any before morrowind. It was pretty horrible, but each to their own. If you can handle the menus I would recommend replaying oblivion, for me it was a true fantasy RPG, like none I've seen since. I personally think that it does fantasy better then all the other TES games, including Skyrim  </TEXT>
