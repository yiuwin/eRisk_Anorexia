	<TEXT> i foster kittens, so i get them at all ages. i had one little one, named Po, who was a suckling machine. started on my cheek once, worked his way down to my chin, then my neck, and at one point my ear. i felt really awkward after that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> as a girl, i think you're completely right. we don't expect to pay for condoms generally, so you shouldn't have to pay for birth control. especially when you already spend so much money for the two of you. what i'd love to know is why in the world she's paying 40 dollars a month for birth control. she can go to her doctor and get a generic brand or even just a different brand and pay what i pay - 10 dollars a month. if she can't afford it at 40, she should figure it out in a different way, especially since she's been on it for longer than you've been together. </TEXT>
