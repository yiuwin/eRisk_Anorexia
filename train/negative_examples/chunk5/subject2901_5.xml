	<TITLE> TIFU By Almost Giving My Captain A Mental Heart Attack (Not Exaggeration) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-02 23:55:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello /r/scioly! Im a proud member of Science Olympiad, Division B. First year of scioly.


Im posting it in a relevant subreddit before I go to /r/tifu.

So its 4/2 today by the time I am posting this. I actually did the prank yesterday on April Foosl day.

My teams captain and I are pretty good friends. Then I have the brilliant idea, which is telling her Im going to quit. And our state competition is pretty soon. Lets have She or just her as code name that I will refer to as, and me as subject2901. Its very important to remember that shes really serious about scioly this year.

So I start off by saying something along the lines of Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

Then about 10 minutes later, she replies with something along the lines of Yes hehe sorry I was doing something (with smile+sweat emoji)

So I ask her if anyone quit science olympiad last year since she was in the 15 competition team. She says no, not that I remember. Then I ask again if anyone quit due to stress and nervousness. She again tells me no, except for one person who left scioly during the summer (he left because he couldnt do it). Then she asks me Why, subject2901?


I reply back quick enough with something along the lines of (every quote from now on will be somewhere along the lines of) Well, I mean, I was going to, nvm

Her: Er ok then

Me: Actually, you know I got assigned into the competition team this year. I had no past experience before this year, and I have to compete in our events

Her: Yeah I know

Me: And things are getting very stressing rn

Me: Its like a week away from state competition...

Her: Yes we know subject2901

Her: Were all nervous

Then I get a bit more aggressive to start the prank, or called by trendy millionaire youtubers, social experiments.

Me: I cant get a schedule change at this time of the year...so

Her: Why, do you want me to lesson your filler event?

Me: I think Ill just quit scioly den.

Then now is the time I didnt realize she was going crazy inside. But I kept going anyway.

Omg

subject2901

Are you dead serious rn

Me: Yes.

Omg

Literally a week or so now

Dont worry about it

Please subject2901

I need an answer from you

This thing continues for a FULL MINUTE. At this point Im figuratively grinding her brain into pieces. Then I send her a screenshot of [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=april+fools safe=strict espv=2 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0ahUKEwjngtLl4IbTAhVEJiYKHXjpBuIQ_AUIBigB biw=1920 bih=950)

Her reply in exact words: OH MY GOSH

OI_PEID

Me: Lol

OI_PEID NEVER DO THAT AGAIN

LITERALLY

I WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK

Then this goes on back and forth, I keep apologizing for it and she says shes alright in the end.

Technically, this was a fuck-up because I almost stirred a lot of drama or whatever right? Either way, fun true story to tell all of you. I posted it later on social media with the caption 10/10 would give heart attack again. Message me for what happened.

Now its time to get a little more serious for State tournament.

TL;DR: For an April Fools prank, I decided to tell my captain that I will quit scioly before competition. She got hella scared and it was a good prank gone right and wrong. </TEXT>

And one exception: obsidian, an igneous rock.
