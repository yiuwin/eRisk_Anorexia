They said something along the lines of having photographic evidence of what happened to the plane and how it got shot down by the AA, but couldn't reveal the pictures because of the same reason you said. And would reveal to Russia on how they would be monitoring the conflict in Eastern Ukraine.

I'm not sure, but I think they held a closed meeting with the Dutch and Malaysian investigators about the pictures. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is pretty much a full circle at this point. If anyone remembers, the first "Battlefront" was a Mod/re skin of BF1942 that got taken down by LucasArts so that they could make their Battlefront. (This is what happened with Aliens Isolation too.)

Maybe Disney will take this down and create the Battlefront that people wanted. ^(I hope...) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't know why people keep repeating this, but the current Battlefront isn't a re skin of Battlefield, since the original Battlefronts actually were. The current one is a completely skimmed down version of Battlefield, and the two dice games have barely anything in common.

An actual re skin of Battlefield would've been amazing, fighting on large conquest maps with usable vehicles/fighters using one of the 4/6 soldier classes, instead of COD powerups and rechargeable grenade spams that there currently is.

IIRC the really first Battlefront was a BF1942 mod before LucasArts came and took it down to make their Battlefront. (Kinda like what happened with Aliens isolation.) Maybe right now we will go full circle with Disney taking down this and giving the fans what we really want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Squads sometimes are more further apart from each other in case of a situation like this. And this type of scenario, similar to the gif has been caught on camera.

I can't find the video, but it was a kinda NSFW video with some Donetsk rebel/fighter/soldier in the Ukrainian war giving an interview to some Russian news crew. The guys squad/group is seen in the background walking together and he calls out to them to spread a little further from each other. A few seconds later, a mortar hits them. The news was edited to pause right before the explosion.

Someone might know what I'm talking about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the beginning of summer, and a new wave of young kids who don't want to go outside, find a website that they're going to spend time on every day. They pick up the circlejerks that most of Reddit is already is tired of, and then join the hate subs after arguing with some mod for throwing a temper tantrum about the "via 9gag" thumbnail or some shit. Then continue bitching about it there for months. After that, they finally realize that /r/adviceanimals isn't actually funny and they either turn into a sane redditor *or* unsubsribe from everything and start hanging out in the hate subs. </TEXT>

It would be weird if Halo would've been a Mac game. The Xbox probably wouldn't be as popular without Halo, and a Mac game like Halo would've probably changed how Macs would run games. Maybe Apple Pippin would've been more successful in that alternate world. </TEXT>

The doctor said that I only had to rest and not do something like sit ups that could cause it to tear up again.

	<TEXT> Wups, forgot to post the [source.](https://youtu.be/vRgpV7RFnic?t=4m) Seems like it is.
