	<TEXT> I think CNN is basing that claim off the early reports. RCN is the cable provider so I assume CNN must have assumed the inappropriate content came from RCN. 

Usually when stuff like this happens it is the local providers fault and not the channel. CNN must have come to this conclusion after the initial reports and the fact that CNN knew they didn't air the content. 

This is all really confusing and probably confused CNN as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the MLB found in it's investigation that Howard and Zimmerman didn't violate anything

Thats not exactly what happened. The MLB only said that they found no evidence of PED use. 

Which is obviously different than finding proof that they did not use PEDs. Of course if they didn't use PEDs then the MLB would never find any proof. 

I'm just trying to say that the MLB investigation does not necessarily mean the AJ report was incorrect. Even though it probably was inaccurate. 

One side is clearly lying. I'm sure eventually the truth will come out.  </TEXT>
