	<TEXT> **UPDATE!**

Hey guys so it's finally come to an end and I've listened to over 5 hours of solid insults. It's been a crazy couple of days but in a weird way I enjoyed it. Some of the insults were hilarious and I can't wait to talk about it on stage some time.

To all those who have entered but not had their response I've promised I will eventually get through them all and I will but now instead of calling me every hour of the god damn day I can now call up the number to receive my insults (ironically at a cost to myself but a promise is a promise) So it will be slower but I will get through them eventually.

To all those who left a message thanks so much for taking part and I hope this little prank cheered you up in some way and finally to u/lordmatthew aka Matt who built the site... I owe you buddy. I owe you big!

Thanks everyone and maybe catch you soon.

James Xx </TEXT>
