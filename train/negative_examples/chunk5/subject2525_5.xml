	<TEXT> Your girl has your back, her siblings got your back too, screw her parents because you've got the necessary backups already. Let her turn 21 while you try and be self made before she turns 21, then you two can elope together. Be yourself, if she loves you for who you're then to hell to what every other person thinks. I bet her  father is a control maniac. </TEXT>
