	<TEXT> Played a match on Nuke today, started T-side. The other team called a timeout on turn 2, we didn't call one for the rest of the half. Then we switch teams and they use another timeout. We tried to timeout later the 2nd half but couldn't, it said our team didn't have any left.

Valve pls fix  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since standard will be coming out soon, either keep all your dust or get something like Sylvanas. Ragnaros could work too if they nerf Big Game Hunter.

Another alternative would be to get a lot of commons, rares and some epics to make a cool deck. </TEXT>
