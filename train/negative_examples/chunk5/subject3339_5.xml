	<TEXT> Compared to 1981-2010 yes but not 1910-1940.

Are data sizes are to small to predict correctly which is why climate change denial is a thing.

Science predicts one thing and then mother nature says fuck you.

Science says more strong hurricanes are going to hit the west coast mother nature hasn't done much.

	<TEXT> Peanuts! any up and comers the UFC hires make 4 times what they would in bellator it's then up to them to get on a win streak and create hype/value. 

Joe is now a free agent so the UFC will make a offer probably doubling what he makes 50k/50k and if bellator wants to pay more the UFC will cut him and move on with out too much worry because the lightweight division is packed with killers and the ppv king. the only upside Joe Duffy has is He beat Conor so if he makes it thru any of the top 5 he has a story to sell but seeing as he has already lost to Dustin the UFC doesn't think that will happen anytime soon. Better to let him go to bellator get big there then bring him back into the fold if he becomes their champ  </TEXT>
