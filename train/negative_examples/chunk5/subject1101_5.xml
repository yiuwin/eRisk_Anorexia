Get a Life didn't do this at first but when it aired in syndication, they lopped off cast credits for actors who didn't appear in episodes, based on the fact that no one on that show really appeared consistently after season 1. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His videos aren't the worst and he clearly has a knack for editing and presentation.

My problem with him, well... I actually don't inherently hate the fact that his Weezer videos are an hour long, he's clearly passionate and I think it comes through sometimes. However, sometimes he just needs to condense and his "jokes" make me want to leap out of a window more often than not. Like, in his EWBAITE review, there were several segments totally unrelated to Weezer where he just argued with some anime character about their relationship... and it was supposed to be funny because the character just made unintelligble noise? Yeah c'mon dude, you should know to cut that shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's an impressive voice actor. Maybe not one of the all-time greats, but he's good. Solid vocal range and he can deliver funny lines adequately.

Live action though? Fuck no. He was so out-of-place in that godawful western movie... Sorry Seth, not everyone is born to be in front of the camera. His performance probably made up around 50% of the contempt I hold for that pile of junk. It barely made any money at the box office, too, so I have no idea why this show is getting the go-ahead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, although the squigglevision is fine imo, this show works quite well with just audio. It has enough dialogue that context can be deciphered for most scenes even without the incredibly basic animation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, if that last example is supposed to be a heinous thing prevented by this bill, what do you think about the passing trans people who are forced to use the other bathroom based on it? Seems like it would be just as weird. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't get your hopes up too much. The animation team for Bob's Burgers is behind a LOT of crap. 

Brickleberry. Bordertown. Allen Gregory. A Tyler Perry movie. A Jeff Dunham movie.

(I'd even say Bob's might be their only decent work, but then again I can't recant their entire filmography off the top of my head). </TEXT>
