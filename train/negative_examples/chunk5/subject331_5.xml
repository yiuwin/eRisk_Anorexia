Ray finds himself in a holding pattern, waiting to see if Belikov will be released from prison. An art dealer invites Ray to a breast cancer benefit where he encounters some former clients. Teresa spirals into postpartum depression. Meanwhile, Mickey goes to great lengths to convince the DA that he was the one behind the Minassian massacre. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is rule 3 in our sidebar. They are actors, they've appeared in other stuff before.

To clarify in case it's needed, content about the actors themselves is fine, such as one of them appearing on a talk show to talk about Silicon Valley or whatever. The primary concern about rule 3 is karma whoring and low-relevance content. A screengrab of Thomas Middleditch from The Wolf of Wall Street with the title "Look who it is!" isn't the sort of content that's needed here.

And to the anonymous souls that have consistently reported these posts, you are heroes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [No Spoilers] PSA: Many submissions will be marked as NSFW to help hide spoilers, not because they are actually NSFW. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-14 21:49:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The reason for this is because reddit lacks native spoiler functionality.

Marking a submission as NSFW makes it so you have to click to see the image.

The reason we do this is because on some mobile platforms, such as m.reddit.com, the image will load in full and display automatically as you're scrolling down your front page, when you're not even browsing the /r/MrRobot subreddit.

An example thread is "[[No Spoilers] It lasted about 2 seconds](https://redd.it/4srqwu)". If you look at it on your desktop, the thumbnail reveals very little - you can't even read the text unless you're actually trying to.

Now look at it through m.reddit.com's [display](https://m.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/4srqwu/no_spoilers_it_lasted_about_2_seconds/). The image is automatically loaded and displayed in full. Marking a thread as NSFW makes it so you have to click to confirm you want to see the image, as you can see in this [Spoilers S2E1 thread](https://m.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/4st72k/spoilers_s2e1_maybe_this_is_a_clue/).

We know that this causes confusion among users who will wonder why a thread is marked as NSFW, but given the fact that reddit does not have a built-in spoiler function, this is the best we can do. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [All Spoilers] Taking flair requests for the /r/MrRobot subreddit </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-13 05:13:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all, with a new season should come new flair, and I'm looking for user input on what to make flairs of.

If you want a flair made of a particular character, then if possible tell me the scene you want a flair made from or post a screengrab. Otherwise I'll just find some random picture to work with that you might not like.

My thoughts on the design of flair: I will be making them have a max height of 30px, because if you make stuff taller than that it starts to mess up the display of comments. Related to that, I will fix an issue with text flair in the subreddit that causes [this](http://i.imgur.com/FGVrlgt.png) to happen where the display is too tall.

I also like to design flair for characters that include a little bit of their shoulders and neck, so they aren't disembodied heads like our current flair are. 

Do you like the idea of how I design flair, or like the head look? I've never really taken feedback on it before so I don't really know how users prefer it. I've done flair for /r/BoJackHorseman, /r/OrphanBlack and /r/Gotham before if you want examples of how I like to do it.

***

TL;DR give me flair ideas. I already have some of my own it's just hard to remember all the possible things to make flair of. </TEXT>
