	<TEXT> All this comment did was say things a producer should already know. Quality over quantity, submit good work to bigger labels. Then it was you just self defending yourself for the shitty title. 
Also, you're blowing the "problem of shitty demos" way out of proportion. It's not that big of a problem, because by even having open demos, you're going to get shitty ones. Part of a label.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I don't know the song name, but here's what I can tell you that might help:

Because they didn't credit it, it's non-copyright. 

It's definitely future bass and has female vocals. 

It's likely a more popular song, as most youtubers like using popular songs to get more views, and that way they don't have to look for a while. 

Good luck! </TEXT>
