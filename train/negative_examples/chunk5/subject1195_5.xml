	<TEXT> I saw this today - I fucking loved it. I really hope that Jordan Peele gets an Oscar nomination either for his screenplay or his direction - both were top-notch (I especially loved the opening shot that was done in a single take). Allison Williams was also creepy as hell in this - a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her would be well-deserved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I predicted $26.7 million [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/5x6vgg/get_out_second_weekend_predictions/) - pretty damn close! :) I also think Universal is being very conservative with their estimated Sunday drop, so it likely have $27-28 million once final numbers come out tomorrow.

Also, is the first time that we've seen the top two movies at the box office be R-rated in a while? I feel like we don't see that very often.  </TEXT>

Amazing drop for Get Out - word-of-mouth is really out of this world. This baby could do $150 million+ now, especially if its terrific legs continue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fantastic number for Logan - here's hoping for a great Saturday and Sunday. It would be pretty awesome to see it surpass The Matrix Reloaded's $91.8 million and get the second biggest opening for a R-rated film. 

Get Out continues to do amazing business.

The Shack did very solid as well - I was pretty sure it would break out, since the book was massively popular.  </TEXT>

I'm not surprised at all by this - Get Out was selling out showings left and right last night, judging by reports on Twitter. Audiences are loving the shit out of this movie.  I think it'll have pretty insane legs for some time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are your predictions for Get Out's second weekend? After the terrific week days it's been having (clearly benefiting from incredible word-of-mouth), I'm going to predict it'll have a second weekend of $26.7 million (a 20% drop from last weekend). 

Even with Logan probably getting a huge opening weekend, I think that Get Out will still perform extremely well even in the face of huge competition. </TEXT>

A lot of people watching the Oscars telecast likely had never heard of Moonlight and might be intrigued to check it out at the theater now. $2-3 million is a more realistic prediction, but it would be pretty awesome if it ended up close to what I'm hoping for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, Logan will probably do massive business this weekend. I personally wouldn't be surprised if it grosses $100 million this weekend. Get Out will also likely have another great weekend. It had a low drop Monday drop grossing $4.1 million, which indicates word of mouth is incredible. I'm predicting a $20 million weekend for it.

Moonlight should receive a very nice bump in gross this weekend as a result of the expansion. It should gross around $7-8 million this weekend at least, I think. </TEXT>
