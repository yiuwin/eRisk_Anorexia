	<TEXT> haha yeah I'm so used to hot sauce. As well as the shots I used to bite my nails so my dad used to put chili sauce on them so when I bit them it hurt, and I always used to forget and get it in my eye. 
 I had temper problems as a kid and my dad hated that. Told me he'd be very happy if I died the next day and that he'd have great pleasure burying my bones. I remember being overjoyed when they passed a law in the UK saying you couldn't hit kids hard enough to leave a mark any more, not that it stopped him. 

 All better now. 

Hope things are good with you  </TEXT>
