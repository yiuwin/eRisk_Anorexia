	<TEXT> I write here, in comment, that it was really good fun to make that stop motion movie.
My son is 5 years old and during making video I tried to build the truck, and he was trying to disturb me all the time:) You can see his attempts.

My son (and.. yes, me too:)) is very proud of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, thanks for comment. 
I don't agree with You in one thing: "Olive oil will get gross and sticky in a week or so. "
It;s not true. If You get natural oil - yes it will get sticki and rancid, but not olive oil !
I have several wooden cutting desks finished with olive and they aren't sticky at all. The oldest has more than 3 years and it is still good.
Also, as I said in other comment:
Olive oil isn't bad idea for kitchen wooden things. It's good for people, non poisonous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, thanks for advice. Vinegar is a good idea but after such bath the knife will have no rust but still there will be bumps and holes in it. Am I right ? What to do with them then ? </TEXT>
