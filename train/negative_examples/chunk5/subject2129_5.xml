	<TEXT> How much money did you spend?

Also are you very well off financially?

I traveled all across the U.S.A. in my late teens to early 20's.

I did allot of neat things From mining quarts crystals and making them into crafts to making cloths and selling them to get by.

However i also saw allot of the dark side of life, like people who lost everything to drug use, I even befriended a heroin addict named Tod who contracted AIDS whilst sharing a needle.(watched him wither away)

Tod really affected me the most he was extremely articulate and  very well read.

Tod really had a gift to write, and had a beautiful mind.


I guess what i am saying is despite the fact i had seen so many awesome places and did amazing things.... my take away was a bit dark as you can see.

Just curious as to what your take away from this experience is for you.

Sure i have my downswings, and uncertainties of what's coming around the corner, but that's life (A series of corners)

My grass is dead in my front yard, my neighbors a healthy green.. however his daughter has had 3 heart surgeries including a transplant.

I think of it as an extension of there music more than just a repeat of what's already been done.

I absolutely love the music and i think of this as a great way to find like minded artists....so far i have found so many great new tunes to listen to on my ride to work : )

I have spent countless hours searching and listening to music that's similar to BoC to create something cool for us all to enjoy.

My hope is to extend your listening pleasure, as a hard core BoC fan i really like the idea and hope you do to.

	<TEXT> What's really outstanding is i think she is Muslim....now before you go down voting me let me explain.

In Muslim culture dogs have been seen as impure, and the Islamic legal tradition has developed several injunctions that warn Muslims against most contact with dogs. 

Even going so far as to being asked to wash there hands 7 times after contact with a dog.


So i find this really nice to see as a dog lover this Muslim women being so kind to this dog. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in the days i owned my own tech business allot of times clients would bring in laptops to be repaired and simply never come to pick them up.

Every few months i ended up with 5 or 6 pc's and laptops so after the client refused to answer my calls to pick there computer up I'd sell them on Craigslist.

This poor lady bought This crappy Toshiba laptop off me even though i disclosed all the specs she bought it for 80 dollars.

A few days go buy and i get a call, she is near in tears telling me the Laptop has no WiFi and that i need to fix it.

I told her she needed to buy a pcmcia WiFi card and if she did i would install it for free so she did and i installed it.

OMG the very next day i get a call again from her now sobbing "it won't connect to my WiFi it's asking for a password"

So i'm like ok i just have to get this lady off my back so i go over to her house and low and behold she has no router just the cable modem.

So i tell her that she needs to buy a wireless router so we go to the store buy one and i install it set it up with a password of her choice....Done right ?

Nope the very next day she calls me this time really angry saying she needed it to run win xp not windows 2000...I tell her the laptop will not run win xp properly because it wasn't made for it.

However i did some research and found a win xp lite edition...it's basically a super stripped down version of xp that i think will run.

So i'm thinking this will be the last time i will go over there, install the shit and never hear from her again...everything went smooth even though i had to spend an hour searching for drivers and i even threw in a version of Office...Done Right ?

Nope she calls me the very next day FUMING that the version of office isn't the one she likes and she has free WiFi at her building so why did i make her buy the router.

I decide to go over one last time i notice her neighbor has an open WiFi connection with no password and explain it's not the buildings rather a neighbor who was careless not to secure his connection and that if she really wanted to get work done not to depend on such a connection.

I upgraded Office to her liking although still not the latest version because of the laptops specs....Done Right ?

Nope she calls me the very next day screaming over the phone that she can't connect to her WiFi ....apparently she returned the router and decided to connect to her neighbors WiFi that was now password protected.

I tell there is nothing i can do further to support her that she needs to call another tech because i am too busy and already went further than normal to make this work....she abruptly hangs up the phone....Done Right?

Nope the very next day i come home after grocery shopping and find the lady's laptop smashed inside a plastic shopping bag with a note that read "you lie, your a scam,WiFi card won't connect I'm done with you fuck you and your laptop"

Looking at the laptop it seems she smashed the laptop with a hammer however i did find out why it wasn't connecting to the WiFi ...the card she bought was accidentally slightly ejected from its slot : (

Most of his shtick revolves around ass jokes and scatological humor...the idea that Bam derives this stuff as an endless source of amusement is cringe worthy if not embarrassing.

Bam is a grown man trapped under the shadow of his former self (The outlandish crazy teen) that at the time worked....however at the age of 36?.....i think it's sad.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like a creepily inefficient design how on earth could that have been maintained for hundreds of years?

Further more the whole Sam Club look to it (sheesh), warehousing the dead.

Just like a supermarket you paid for shelf space so if you where poor you'd be looking at granny 50 feet above shoved on a shelf like a pallet tomato sauce.

If you had money you could pay to have a waist level view of granny.

Also and just going on a hunch, these caskets where not designed for above ground use.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may have a little bit of leaf minor action going on there...rip open one of the leaves that shows a tiny bubble and see what's  inside.

Also fertilize the base of the tree and build a mote to retain water so it seeps into the root system(don't over fertilize)


As far as minor bugs and other insects hire a licensed Arborist to do a systemic injection near the root system.

	<TEXT> Ghetto life is a universe in itself.

It's  hard I'm guessing to break free of......if these are your values how on earth are you capable of assimilating in society?

They got it "cracking" in a corner store and take pride in acting this way.

Others work really hard to get a career and a dream started.

Ghetto life has stolen there dreams so to make up for it there surroundings have groomed there behavior  into these instant gratifications.

No Hope,No Dreams give me give me everything i want, my hands can clinch a fist but can not build.   </TEXT>
