	<TEXT> Thanks for the feedback. First of all I wouldnt call this my comfort zone. Yo dont know whats comfortable for me to draw and paint is and what is not.  Secondly there are people who are asking for these and thats why there are still coming. And the last thing is that i dont see anything wrong in doing same things over and over in art at all. I dont want to compare anything but look at cezane and his Mont Sainte-Victoire which he made like 20 times at least, which we know about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Few people mentioned this same thing about my two other pieces here and this time I was actually going after that. So I am glad it kind of worked. Bill Watterson is a big influence. Until now it was more about the philosohpy of the graphic novel. Lately it bacame about the art as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for such a nice comment. But i dont consider myself talented. I believe its all abou practice. I personaly have to draw sketch or paint every single day because if I dont I can feel the difference after a painting break. So I believe even though I dont know you that you are also capable of such paintings. You just have to be patient and try. But not too hard. Results will sure come. Not after a week or month. But once in while when you look back you will see it.  </TEXT>
