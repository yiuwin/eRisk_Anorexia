	<TEXT> No. Shame on them. Pokemon is supposed to be highly competitive. Some people work extremely hard to get the flashiest/strongest pokemon they can. Pokegenners are fucking faggots looking for attention by stealing their mom's credit card and buying a powersave device so they can do exactly what you just described. Don't even try to be sanctimonious you sack of shit.  </TEXT>
