	<TEXT> So, my school is competing against charter schools and we can never win state because what they do is ONLY, ONLY focus on the competition and then just go to their classes on test dates and talk to their teachers occasionally and bam! They pass. Is this legal? 
I live in CA. Those charter schools are part of the LAUSD district. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 16 and my parents are that supportive. They don't really take me seriously. And I have been to the hospital. Many, many times. It's always the same routine. The doctors never believe me either. Just because they have a piece of paper saying they're doctors means "don't listen to what your patient says because I'm the one with the diploma."  </TEXT>
