	<TEXT> I really think this is the issue in American politics today. We can't stomach compromise. To say that "he is letting fear betray his principles" is essentially a dramatic way of saying Bernie compromised. 

This is exactly what happened with the Republicans after '08. They refused to compromise and all progress in Congress came to a halt. 

Compromise is thought of a bad thing amongst ideologues. Compromise is the art of politics. Our political system simply does not work without compromise. This country was founded on compromise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you not understand that it is the Republican party that is fractured? Johnson is in a position to easily capture conservative voters unwilling to vote for Trump. 

85% of Sanders supporters said they will vote for Clinton and that was before he endorsed her. 

Who is this liberal third party candidate? Do you know that most deadline filing dates have past? 

Clinton essentially needs to win one of the three swing states listed in this headline. This is one poll released in early July, showing tight contests well within the margin of error. Try no to be so reactionary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Seats in Congress has nothing to do with electing a president.

lol the electoral college votes are tied to how many seats each State has. If the three candidates split the vote and no one passes the 270 threshold the vote bounces to Congress. Whichever party has more seats wins the presidency. Seats in Congress have everything to do with electing a president. </TEXT>
