	<TEXT> Yeah this store is shit man i ordered a pair of the 3m high tops and if you think superbuys QC photos are shit you should see the state of the shoes they send me, there was no shape to them the back was flat the sole wasn't glossy, there was no padding on the logo, the stitches pointed to the 5th spike when it should be the 3rd spike on the toe box. If you wear these shoes your gonna look like a nonce in 1:1 gucci but 0.2:1 Loubs. Pay the premium and buy from PKZ its worth it, they do have some minor flaws but at least the shape is good, the sole is glossy, the logo is padded, the spikes are aligned perfectly   the materials are good. I always buy my shoes from PKZ except i bought runners from slamxhype. People moan about the price but the materials are on point man and its still 1/4 of retail.   </TEXT>

    THE REVIEW OF PARCEL NUMBER ONE OF THREE FROM MY 1K TAOBAO HAUL!


                               AGENT USED : SUPERBUY

              AGENT RATING : 10/10 Super Helpful   Friendly!


      MY STATS : Weight 84kg, Height 5ft 8in, 30in Waist, Shoes EU42/UK8, Retail Size M-L.


                            ITEMS, REVIEW   W2C

* **Gucci Vintage Hoodie, Price 390y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=548336569442), [Alternate](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c-s.w4002-16145190987.39.FsWf6m id=548280761361)** *Overall GREAT quality, not too heavy   not light. Print is good, Hardware is good   the tags are good except stitching on the tag should be red and its black. Worth the money? Hell yeah I can see this being one of those hoodies you can't bring yourself to get rid of in 3 years time!! How does it fit? I ordered a L thinking it would be TTS but it runs a little smaller, however i kinda like how it fits but i will probably size up next time.*

* **Gucci Vintage Tee, Price 290y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=548337789426), [Alternate](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-16255786177.50.pQ0Zof id=549000848953)** *I think this is the most 1:1 of this tshirt, it's thin as fuck and the stitching on the tags is red! The only fault I can pick is the green on the belt isn't properly distressed. How does it fit? This tee runs TTS if you like a snug fit I would recommend sizing down as its quite baggy!*

* **El-Cheapo Gucci Slides, Price 238y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=546251111030)** *Not the worst batch i've seen, **NO BLACK LINES** But there is a generous gap between colours other than that these are comfy as shit and the overall quality is sick*
[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/tQysj)


* **Givenchy Shorts, Price 290y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=548283404230)** *OMG these shorts are to die for, I swear these are the comfiest shorts i've ever worn. The quality is top notch, from material to stitching. These will be getting a whole lot of wear through summer!! How do they fit? Like boxing shorts, I feel like i'm about to get in the ring with Anthony Joshua. **MUST COP**.*

* **Gucci Belt, Price 180y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=547457994625)** *This belt is amazing I love it, the leather is so soft but it feel tough at the same time. I'm not sure about 1:1ness but you can check in the pics.*
[Fit Pics](http://imgur.com/a/rXjOe), [Pics](http://imgur.com/a/FL6qR)


* **DSQUARED2 Cap, Price 45y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=545137598097)** *This is crazy for the price, exactly like retails. Great quality, perfect distressing, not a lie when it says one size fits all this shit could fit floyd mayweather one day and my 7yo bro the next. I'll probably be selling this as i look like a dick when I wear it but definitely a good cop!*
[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/ZxJP5)


* **Balenciaga Runners, Price 498y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=540120723494)** *Oh shit these are fucking fire, 1:1 succ no problem! How do they fit? I thought they ran TTS so I ordered my usual EU42 and turns out they run a size bigger so if anyone wants to buy them they will fit a EU43.*
[Fit Pics](http://imgur.com/a/erueH), [Pics](http://imgur.com/a/sFqgy)


*  **DSQUARED2 Jeans, Price 190y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=539820016944)** * Absolute bargain! They quality, the fit   everything else is just fucking perfect. How do they fit? TTS.*
[Fit Pics](http://imgur.com/a/ZE7Mh), [Pics](http://imgur.com/a/ZxJP5)


* **DSQUARED Shorts, Price 139y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=547586680127)** *Not sure if these ever retailed but they're sick, thick good quality fabric! How do they fit? Very small, I have a 30w and a XXL fits just nice.*
[Fit Pics](http://imgur.com/a/gvx6P), [Pics](http://imgur.com/a/B7SHT)


                                    **SHIPPING**
     *I used EMS, Total was 654y and was refunded 120y. 
    Ordered on 5th may arrived 10th may. No customs issues or charges.*


                                  **CONCLUSION**
     *Overall I am pleased with everything that came in Parcel one, 
    For almost 300 I think the value for money was great, I would 
    definitely use Superbuy everytime I order from Tao everything is smooth 
    sailing and there customer service is the best i've used. 
    I would recommend every item on this list.*

  This is my first review so if there is anything you want me to improve on for the next one just let me know and i'll do it!

Good Luck!
