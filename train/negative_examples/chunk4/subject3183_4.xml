	<TEXT> alright to be fair im not sure if you just wanted a ton of feedback or are hardcore tryen to sell it but whatever.   
   
it's cool. but if u had programmable led's behind it that lit up as a day was finished or vice versa, turned off as a day was finished so it was easier to know where u are at on it even some sort of slider, i could have missed that though.  
   
now what you do is you design an app that goes along side it. make it touch screen. what you type into the app is saved in this calender too. when you press a day a pop up or the middle screen gives you your todo list as well as the weather maybe and recent ten emails.   
   
could probably hit a pretty high price point with it too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah for sure but anxiety and panic falls more in a sense of loss of control. and while he certainly sounded like that his actions were him like taking that head on, erroneously but still. 
  
imo he looked manic. but yeah def anxious. like the way he sounded and looked is how anxious people and panic attack people feel but it's usually more internalized if that makes sense. taht's thesoundtrack running through their head but they're not running around to do something about it. 
   
everyone's different though and mental illness sure isn't something to box in. still symptoms are indicative of certain things so that they are identifiable. my bad, didn't want to contradict myself too much there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> other people suggested panic attacks and it didn't look like a traditional panic/anxiety issue. 
  
i've never seen manic manifest like this but i have heard of it manifesting for some people in events like this. usually at the end of the week where it's been building and getting more and more 'crazy' and an event  like this happens. and really, could have been worst all things considered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> eh man, people take bad builds everywhere and people often think they're taking fitting talents when it's arguably the case. 
   
i'm not saying there isn't good reason to take off build talents and rarely is a talent responsible for a game anyway but still people take all sorts of wacked out builds all the time. 
   
i think valla's q build is more common in higher ranked play and it's definitely questionably applied. or at least in my experience w/ plat/dia guys who always go q when we really needed the multi dmg. or they're not hitting their q dmg like they should.

	<TEXT> good communication. 
   
me and my gf, doing the marriage talk and the eh what if/u want kids m8? talk too. And we were both super clear that it wouldnt be responsible, for a lot of reasons to bring a child with downs into the world. Most of all what if something happened to us? Sure it's our choice to raise the kid but then it becomes someone else's responsibility.     
 
In general we probably won't having kids anyway, small shot we adopt but not at great financial costs. if we did choose to have children feel there's a bit of an ethical obligation to living in the u.s.

	<TEXT> That's what I thought too a sign at top of the hill and a bit more distance between the cones. Can't force it to one lane for too long or force it to one lane too close to the hill but certainly could have done a bit more.  
  
The irony is that with a accidents and slide offs occurring he is at risk of being hit regardless of his trucks position. Being that it was to teh side of him and not more behind him it'd be easy for a car to hit it and then him or slide off and miss the tuck altogether.  
 
Especially going up in the bucket. I don't know how he felt safe doing that with people sliding all over the place down the hill. I'm sure the truck's designed to take some hits with someone up there the best it can but still seems like a situation to avoid at all costs. In a case where there's increased risk or probability of it occurring i'd want to take as much preventative and safety as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His explanation for a  cone per every 10/mph i think is probably applied over the distance you're supposed to be able to stop at that speed. So it'd be a cone every ten feet and obviously not done out of laziness.   
  
To be fair with road conditions like that and a hill that you lose visibility on you should be going a lot slower. Not that I would either or actually i probably would having had some experience with loss of visibility on hills. But either way, I get it and human nature won't necessarily. 
 
And he can't put the cones too far back since he's forcing it to one lane. Need to have the space and visibility of what's going on after the hill altogether so people aren't going in the other direction into oncoming traffic. Sign on the poke for Slow Roadwork would work probably. Or even just pushed out for more space, still making a longer stretch reduced to one lane and might cause a back up and hazard to people going over the hill. 
   
Still more safety could be implemented here just running through scenarios in my head. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ahh the manhatten. i've gotten used to bars passing on the bitters so i do to oat home. i also just haven't ordered them or looked in my grocer/supermarket/liquor store.  
  
I just don't drink at home like I used to. I do enjoy me a cocktail though. And that's usually, almost always, a manhatten. Great f'en drink. 
  
Interesting tidbit, My grandpa used to drink them. He'd drink one whenever he come home from work or have on after dinner. I ordered one being a fan of whiskey/bourbone/rye/ etc and loved it. My grandma was shocked when she found out I was ordering/drinking them but I think a part of her loved it. 
  
What Rye to Vermouth proportion do you use. I've seen 1:2 but imo sometimes I think .5:2.5 is better or even approaching a larger 'splash.'  
  
Maken it with bourbon you animal. JP! I just got some nice rye though so I've been using that. I'm not adverse to a bourbon Manhattan though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for sharing and doing this.  
  
I got a knack for writing, communicating, and getting what I want out of people, er...selling shit.  
  
I've considered going the freelance route and it's happening slowly. It's just tough starting out and you give a quote and people are like...uhhh, how much again? I like your approach of convincing them it's worth it from the start and that there's an ROI.  
  
I'll probably end up in an agency for a bit though tbh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you just do copywriting and/or design for sales/web pages? I think we're using copywriting, maybe, a tad loosely?  
  
I'd also love to see your portfolio. Show don't tell :P. 
   
I also appreciate the hard work you put into to get where you are.   
   
edit: based on your websites illustrations change design to layout... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol the dude above clearly has never negotiated a contract. Travel to Blizzcon was probably covered by Blizzard so it wasn't a, 'we need sponsorship this second' situation.  
  
If they wanted a longer contract they would have negotiated it. I doubt anyone wanted to extend past GC and into HGC on both sides. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it's like that feeling anything could happen. You go out somewhere else, and some places with the right crowd you can get to the right spot but it's like NYC. Where any 4 people going out, with a bit of fuck-it-all attitude can get into any and everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol it's a joke and tongue in cheek. Some of these certainly could be taken a bit more seriously. Like mephisto clearly was by the community and Blizzard, for that matter. 
  
Then he makes the SC Adjutant, while cool, would be a bit OP and impossible to balance. 
  
The tagline to the series is "Where everything is made up and the ideas don't matter!" lol, so I think people take a bit too seriously the stuff they come up with. 
  
A lot of it would be cool.  Being on the outside we work on the presumption that none of this has ever been considered. I think the opposite is probably true but a lot more goes into coming up with ideas and more so, implementing and balancing them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NOLA keeps up. But when a bar is closing at 2AM and people are all like going home. You're all like, where to next? House Party? After hours spot?  
  
What's that? They say. You're like uh, okay then. 
   
The early closing time maybe makes it more conducive to like one night stands cause it's earlier. Even Baltimore wasn't that rowdy. I mean while places were open it was but once it closes down it's like welp, that's that. Philly too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a NYC resident, who done a bit of both those 6, 7, 9 am, two day nights while hard to remember are hard to top. 
  
Shit like this is fun too though. Just more...there's a uniqueness to it and a 'special' sense since you're taking the weekend and going somewhere.  
  
The chance to spend every weekend partying till dawn, or even a Tuesday or Thursday while seemingly Mundane after a year or two was still fun. And most people might look at that as some big city life shit that they'd want to give a shot if they could. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, you don't have a clue what you're talking about it.  
  
It isn't that it's entirely ethical. It's that it's *more* ethical.  
  
And it's within reason. Beef isn't. You'll never get people to stop eating meat. But if you get them to stop eating beef, you'd do the world some good. Plus the argument wouldn't be from how you feel but on something that makes a bit more sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> sustainable isn't a relative term. you have to look at the big picture. one. is it practical to try and get everyone to stop eating meet? nope. is it safe or reasonable? nope. are chickens a good in between? absolutely compared to other meats.   
  
we already grow enough crop for humans. expecting people to change  what they grow so there's more protein oriented crop when the market doesn't demand it is insane. people need to make a living and feed themselves too.  
  
not everyone's body type and biological make up takes to vegetarianism or veganism either. some people are cut out great for it, others not so much.  
 
We probably shouldn't eat fish either i guess or eggs or milk...  
  
fuck it, you're right. idealism *always* wins.   
  
sike, the market does! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> another fair point is chickens aren't the animal to save. they're a *great* source of food and rather sustainable.  
  
i'd give her the points on sustainability of steak and beef, if she went in that direction. appealing to emotions...

	<TEXT> i'm going to give both of these  a read. i *love* reading. and academic papers just fall into that. 
  
considering it's not relevant to my career. i'm convinced there's something seriously wrong with me. or maybe just a positively channeled adhd. 
  
much appreciated. i do recall hearing about it but certainly never took the time to read papers back then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah i agree about the cleaner sense. to be fair though i avoid certain farm raised, even some wild too, just types of fish. tilapia, off the top, is a good on to avoid. catfish certainly i'd stick to wild caught too. salmon i don't eat at all really but would avoid farm raised. 
   
there's some farm raised which are raised in 'tanks' in the ocrean that's super legit. and a good chunk of shell fish is farmed too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your explanation would make you your own best critic. But meh, semantics. 
   
I hear ya. I think my honesty and self critical eye are my two best attributes when it comes to work. At least while I was writing my book. Totally different but still somewhat relevant experience.  
  
edit: i haven't, nor do I think I'll have the time to read that paper (I'll start reading it, then have to look up what I don't understand cut to a ten hour crash course through the details so I don't feel like I'm bullshitting my way through what I took away from the paper).   
  
That said, in regard to EM, I've heard people simplify it to microwaves bouncing around a container. Like my microwave? 
   
The other thing is, wouldn't the vacuum negate the thermal aspect? I already feel out ofp lace asking these questions and I understand why, in regard to errors this experiment is off. Just some curiosities I didn't see answered in the comments. And by all means, ignore em if you want. </TEXT>

i do notice a difference once in a while with farm raised fish. and i was raised on fish. generally i started thinking a lot of it was in my head. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i don't i thiought trump's picks were to placate the GOP. I feel like a lot of your point is based on the premis the GOP hasn't moved further right and doesn't sit firmly in the far right of the spectrum. With it's Tea Party element and overall trend of going further and further right, I don't think that's the case. I think his picks are more of a 'I got you, look who I'm picking! We're going to be conservative as conservative gets.' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think, and I'm not a physicist, but everyone working on that project wanted it to be real as well. It's easy to lose sight of the bigger picture (or only see the bigger picture), have dissident voices not speak up and have a culture/atmosphere created that steers everyone, and the experiment, toward  the result they or the person in charge wants.
