	<TEXT> Lost my Shadowmere when I mounted another house for fun, I later learned that had "unassigned" Shadowmere as my horse and he (she?) wouldn't automatically be my ride when I fast traveled any longer.   Can't remember for the life of me where I left her, I thought by Riften cause that's where I got the other horse but no go.  All these normal horses keep dying -_-  </TEXT>
