	<TEXT> Online dating can be a big time waster in my experience unless you use it to meet people promptly. So long as you meet as early as possible, I think online dating is fine; otherwise I think online dating is a way of matching up the mutually desperate. Don't invest too much time into an online relationship as it becomes harder to "dump" them later when you notice a red flag. If you're stuck in an online relationship which isn't going anywhere do yourselves both a favor and dump them so you can both continue looking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a conservative, I believe in Trump's ideology. I'd like to see political correctness put in the trash where it belongs. His honesty is a major breath of fresh air to me; he says what he thinks without trying to hide anything. I'd like to see that quality lead America. I've admired him for a long time as a businessman, and believe he has what it takes to make America great again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a balance between pain and pleasure. If you don't call them out on their shit, it isn't love. But if you only do that, you're a jerk. A little appreciation goes a long way. Women love their chocolate and their tv show. If you know she's had a rough couple of days, spend some time and relax with her in front of the tv even if you have more important things to do. Try to get important things done during the day so you have a dedicated relaxing time at night. When the kids come along, distraction is your greatest ally and the tv your babysitter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anything dealing with the middle east. Media bias leans either this way or that way conveniently hiding details favorable to the other side. You'll hear the story first to one bias until you hear the other side's coverage to get all the details regarding what happened. No matter who's right in any particular situation, there isn't any neutral media coverage out there. If I tried to run my own coverage, I'd be biased too as I believe in one side and not the other. I don't like being biased though, but it's hard not to be when the media source you're using doesn't give you the full story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anything acidic is bad for the teeth, even milk (pH ~6.6). Aside from water, I can't really think of anything else as healthy and convenient. In general, drinking your calories is unhealthy, with a few exceptions like fruit/vegetable drinks. As someone health conscious, I stick with just water and an occasional smoothie which I make fresh in the blender. I quit soda years ago, and I see coffee isn't that much better. Tea is doable, but I still notice some minor teeth strain especially when there's sugar in it. Sure, there's stressful days I give-in, but I try to limit those to feel healthier. Just water for me. As someone that wants to be healthy, my dad and a number of my family members believe in Gerson therapy, and after giving it a shot, I feel much healthier. So I stick to more of an alkaline diet to try to remineralize my body following a past soda addiction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keeping a clean room, clean table, clean desktop. The secret to keeping my desktop clean is having a folder named "folders". Then I use subfolders for anything specific. As my desktop is so clean, I like to keep an excel file directly on my desktop "LifeOrganizer.xlsx" where I organize everything in my life from the time I pay bills, billing cycles, bank account logs, log various notes, calendar dates, birthdays, and contacts. When it's time to get started working, I tend to make use of the loads of space on my desktop. Many times you need to download various files for whatever you're working on and need to find it. In terms of keeping up the working flow, I like to keep a cup of water next to the computer along with some home-prepared trail mix. Usually peanuts, craisins, and rice chex in a zip lock. I go through it so fast, I started using a larger zip lock. I try to keep away from coffee, water is the best drink. When I lose my focus at work, it's usually due to miscomfort. So I'll go do something I need to do anyways like my laundry, walk the dog, or work on some food. When I'm done taking a "break" doing whatever I'd have to do anyways, then I try working again. If I still can't work, I try to come to terms with why I'm unable to work. Usually I find that dividing whatever I'm unable to work on into smaller easy-to-tackle tasks, that I can do anything. The first of such tasks is identifying something small I can work on related to the work I should be working on. Then working on whatever that is, no matter how small it is. As long as it's related to the work, then it's progress. (I work from home) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're going to build something *very* simple, a framework would only hurt performance and complicate something simple. But if you're going to build something worthwhile, you should be using a framework. Sure, you could get code to work without any specific design pattern, but the code won't be very easy to understand or maintain. You could, of course, write your own "framework" to follow your own "design pattern" mentality, but why reinvent the wheel if it's already done?
  
Laravel is probably the best PHP framework out there to learn if not simple due to its marketing popularity. There's many frameworks out there, but if a team had to collaborate within the same framework, Laravel is an excellent choice. Zend is an ok choice, as it's built by the same company that maintains PHP, but it's rather slow and a bit too abstract to make immediate usage out of. The best part is you can take a certification test in it if you master it and show it off in your resume. (the test you take in person at your local pearsonvue)  
  
But, yeah, for a stackoverflow+reddit styled site, you should *really* be using a framework. But as you're a beginner, it might be a bad idea to jump directly to learning a framework if you don't understand the PHP basics. I'd suggest check out some Laravel tutorials out there and try to write code to the same style of code you find out there. When you get the hang of it, then approach your project. Otherwise, you're more than welcome to try to build something from scratch, without a framework, and see how hard it is. Writing a framework is its own project. Without some kind of framework available to your project, you won't be able to take advantage of proper design patterns and the whole architecture of the project will suck. But if this is solely for learning purposes and second-rate is acceptable, go for it. Just try to steer clear of the common PHP mistakes out there like SQL injection, not escaping output, XSS, and other security-related concerns. </TEXT>
