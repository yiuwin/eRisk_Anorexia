I make more gay jokes but I preform at a comedy club so I made those anyways. 

My family asks me if I'm sure I like men (I'm bi) and they don't understand why I don't date more women. 

In my last relationship with a guy he used to say all the time that I'm the straightest fag he's ever met. 

I'm just me... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It happens like that sometimes, but then one day you'll meet a boy and you'll be staying up late one night imagining what it'd be like to hold his hand. You'll remember that split second when he touched your thigh and you'll be yearning for his scent. 

After you meet the right boy you'll fall in love. I'm bi and I'll tell you right now that falling in love with a guy is different than with a woman and god damn it is more intense.  </TEXT>
