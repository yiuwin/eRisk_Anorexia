	<TITLE> A chopped cheese sandwich inspires suspicion, contempt. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For those who don't know, the [chopped cheese](http://ladyandpups.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/chopped-cheese23.jpg) is essentially a loose meat sandwich with melty cheese on top. Like a cheesy Joe instead of a sloppy Joe. However, this simple sandwich will not go uncontested by the denizens of /r/FoodPorn. 

Is it just a [bootleg cheesesteak?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/5yzgiw/nycs_famous_chopped_cheese_sandwich_41603120/deu5uon/?context=3 st=j07igch2 sh=4adbd550)

	<TITLE> Update: Venison cottage pie </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-16 16:57:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A couple of days ago I posted a question about making cottage pie with venison. Well, I gave it a shot and I used a mix of two parts venison to one part beef--and it turned out really well! I thought I would post my recipe, in case anyone is interested to try it at home. Here are [pictures of how it turned out](http://imgur.com/a/rSMV2). I made a large casserole for my husband and me to eat from during the work week, and a smaller serving that my husband at for dinner (sharing with our baby boy).

Recipe:

I made a large amount, so you can scale this as you'd like. We had venison we had to use, but if you can't get it just use all beef. 

2 lbs ground venison and 1 lb ground beef (92%)

1 yellow onion

4 cloves garlic

4 stalks of celery diced

4 carrots chopped

16 oz mushrooms quartered

1 bag frozen peas

1.5 cup stock (I used veal because I had some on hand)

3 tbs flour

worcestershire sauce to taste

3 tbs tomato paste

2 lbs russet potatoes

4 tbs butter + 1 tbs

1 cup milk gently warmed

boil and mash the potatoes with 4 tbs butter, salt to taste, whipping in the milk as you go. Set aside. 

Sweat the diced onion in the remaining tbs of butter. Brown the meat in batches and set aside. Add the mushrooms and saute until they start to release their water and the water starts to cook off. Add the flour and stir on medium heat. Add the celery, carrots, garlic, worcestershire, and tomato paste and continue sauteing for about 8 minutes. Add the stock and the meat and continue stirring on medium heat until your stew starts to thicken up and the flour is cooked. Stir in the peas (the peas will release water, but there is enough flour in the mixture that it won't be too watery). Spoon into a casserole dish and top with mashed potato. Bake at 400F for about 25 minutes or until top starts to brown. 

Side note: I didn't measure my seasonings, I'm sorry to say, but I seasoned the filling with thyme, Tellicherry pepper, kosher salt, garlic powder, and a little oregano.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My husband asked me to make him one thing he can eat for the next few days to make things simple. We have ground venison from last year that I need to use, so I thought maybe I could do a sort of cottage pie with venison. However, venison is pretty lean, and I was wondering if I should get some beef to balance it out. Have any of you made something like this before, and if so, do you have any tips?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For background, Meryl Streep criticized Donald Trump in her speech at the Golden Globes last night for his mocking of a disabled reporter--and she also made statements about American football and Mixed Martial Arts. Specifically, she said: "Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners, and if we kick 'em all out, you'll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts." 

People had strong reactions. 

In /r/politics, a huge [argument about Trump's intentions](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mvi40/meryl_streep_calls_out_donald_trump_for_mocking/dc6x9kn/?context=3 st=ixq7655i sh=3d4507d4)

In /r/MMA, things go a slightly different direction with an [argument about the word "retarded"](https://np.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/5mv9be/meryl_streep_comments_on_mma_at_golden_globes/dc6nidq/?context=3 st=ixq7b2r4 sh=44ab2f49)

In another /r/politics thread about Trump's reaction to Streep's comments, [there's drama about who "won" the interaction](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mx8w0/trump_fires_back_at_overrated_meryl_streep/dc719j6/?st=ixq7igah sh=22499dc3)

And of course there are people [bickering in /r/movies as well](https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5mugk9/rmovies_official_2016_golden_globes_discussion/dc6mif6/?st=ixq7n2x0 sh=300aa158)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Background: there's a frequent commenter in /r/DailyShow named Donnadre who really appears to dislike the show in its current state. [Here's a post that provides a little more background](https://np.reddit.com/r/DailyShow/comments/56h9d4/why_does_everyone_here_downvote_donnadre/?st=iwecfubl sh=e8e6f9d8). Some of the other frequent commenters have become irritated with this pattern, leading to occasional conflicts, downvote storms, and accusations of harassment and alt accounts.  Full disclosure: I commented in this post twice, but I deleted my comments because this drama was just too amusing.

**********************************

I may be way off the beam here, and I know we see a lot of zany theories in here so have patience: 

Bernard as a host makes sense, but I do not think he was a "ground-up" creation of Ford's. I think Bernard was a person who worked with Ford. He had a wife, he had a son, son died. At some point he was replaced and had his own memory and sense of self programmed into him. So when he talked with his ex wife, she's a real person, and she still thinks he's a real person. I'm not in the Bernard = Arnold camp. I don't think that makes sense, but I do think that Bernard is the product of what Arnold was working on--what Delos is actually interested in. Arnold figured out a way to transfer people's memories and consciousness into hosts, thus giving them a way to preserve youth, life, etc. Maybe Bernard even gave himself up to this experiment after his son died (although I think it makes more sense that Ford just had him killed by his own double).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> SRD PSA: We're Going to Start Being Harder on Grandstanding and Surplus Posting </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-31 14:17:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Greetings Dramanauts,

Its time again for one of our cozy fireside chats about comments and postsspecifically grandstanding and surplus topics.  Over the past couple of months weve noticed the smug levels [going up to 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOO5S4vxi0o), which as audiophiles know is one more than 10 and well beyond the acceptable threshold. Similarly, weve seen an uptick in the number of surplus popcorn postsmany of which simply arent special enough to merit a post. 

**What *Is* Grandstanding, Anyway?**

Heres a simple guide:

* Are you making a comment about the drama, or are you simply making a general comment on an issue about which you feel passionate? If its the latter, you could be grandstanding.

* If you are talking about surplus topics (trans drama, gender wars, social justice issues etc.) in a non surplus thread, you are being off topic and grandstanding.

* Could you have made this comment without even having read the drama? If so, you could be grandstanding. 

* Are you making a comment about how much Reddit sux? If so, dont do itits against the rules. 

* Are you counterjerking because you think that somehow only you can save SRD by setting straight those damn SJWs and putting them in their place? If so, you could be grandstanding. 

We dont want any of it, and its turning this place into a landfill. **If we see comments like this, they will be removed.** If you continue to do it after being warned, **you may be banned**. 

**About Surplus**

About the surplus topics, you know them well. They are in the sidebar. If youre going to post surplus drama, make sure its large enough in scale and interesting enough to merit a post. Were going to return to being more exacting when approving surplus posts, so be prepared as we may remove them. Over the past few months, weve gotten a bit laxhell, I even posted a couple of surplus self posts, and I usually just stick to food and relationship dickery. Weve got to tighten the reins in order to keep our front page (and our comment sections) diverse and interesting. Help SRD stay diverse and interesting by posting unusual drama topicsand only make surplus posts if theyre exceptional. What is exceptional, you might ask? It doesn't just mean big--it means interesting. If it's the same old arguments about ephebophiles vs. pedophiles, or whether or not trans people are one gender or the other, well, that's not what we're looking for. I know that terms like "interesting" are fairly subjective, but think of it this way: if we've seen the same argument about a surplus topic posted here a million times before, we no longer consider it interesting enough. This is not an effort to stymie or promote any particular viewpoint--rather it's an effort to keep posts fresh. 

**About Self Posts**

Finally, you might ask "but why do we still need to make self posts if we get karma no matter what?" Here's the deal--if you're making a surplus post, chances are you're going to need more than just one thread to cut it, and a self post provides that opportunity. They're always editable, they're expandable, they're ideal for surplus topics, as well as larger topics that span multiple subs/posts. And since you get karma for it now, there's no reason not to.

I've had this Kitchen Aid for about 4 years, I use it about once a week on average, and this has never happened. I thought back to whether or not I had washed the attachments in the dishwasher absentmindedly. I figure that must be what happened, because everything I've read online said that's why this happens. 

So here's a tip on how to clean them if you encounter this residue problem. I heated a large pot of water (about 2 quarts) and vinegar (about 3 cups). Get it simmering, add the attachments, put on low and cook 20 minutes. Remove with tongs when safe, and rinse and wipe them. My attachments are like new--no more residue. 

And no matter what you do, hand wash those Kitchen Aid attachments! I can't think of anything else that could have caused this to happen. 

As a side note, I made a second batch of pizza dough and it's currently sitting out for its second rise. I am looking forward to pizza.  </TEXT>
