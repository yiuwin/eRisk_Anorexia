	<TEXT> I think it depends on the girl; but, that said, it does not take me 30 minutes or anywhere close. If you do your foreplay right, it can happen pretty quickly. For me, clitoral stimulation is key; as is for most girls. That can be affected by the position and whatnot. But like it's been said, communication, communication, communication! If it feels good she should be telling you. If she doesn't want you to stop, goddamnit, don't stop! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a zoology major at Michigan State and, really, I've learned so much. Animals are really my passion; I'm not looking to go to vet school, but moreso in something that's conservation-focused. Be prepared for a lot of science-related classes, I know that sounds obvious, but some people go into shell shock. If you don't like biology, I wouldn't recommend it, of course. Here, we have a lot of concentrations you can go into, like neurology, animal behavior, zoo and aquarium science, etc. I graduate this year so I can't tell you about the pay haha, but check out that site from below! </TEXT>
