	<TEXT> Does anyone know if it's still possible to upgrade a phone on VZ and keep unlimited data via the upgrade switch trick? (ie- transfer my upgrade to a line with capped data and get the upgrade there, then essentially switch em out after the fact) This deal seems too good to pass up...

Edit: Deal is gone. Back to $249. Alas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not expert, but it looks like the hardware is pretty different. (2x L2 cache, updated core) I assume all that means a more involved process. </TEXT>
