	<TEXT> Regardless of who you think the area belongs to, isn't right now a bad time to give it away? ^(You know.. Because of the whole civil war going on there...)

And who will get the Golan Heights? [If this map is correct](http://syria.liveuamap.com/), it seems like the place will have a hard time if it will be given away.

And why is this whole thing discussed without Assad or someone else representing Syria? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Internet traffic to Wikipedia pages summarizing knowledge about terror groups and their tools plunged nearly 30 percent after revelations of widespread Web monitoring by the U.S. National Security Agency, suggesting that concerns about government snooping are hurting the ordinary pursuit of information.

OP posted the first paragraph instead of the title. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For an FPS, I was surprised to hear the soundtrack From Battlefield Bad Company series.

From the first game:
[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5HqlYBowvg),
[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFpHm8kfVa4)

And from the second:
[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeocrOg4eXM),
[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1AM-wvSIV4)

I liked how the soundtrack would fit in every part of the story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same thing happened to me.

My friend showed me the picture and I saw it as white/gold when I was inside a car on a sunny day. I just agreed on what he said and didn't pay much attention to the picture at that time. 

Later I see this topic trending on Reddit and I see it as blue/black. So I'm like "wtf, this picture you told me about is here right now, but it's clearly a edited to be blue/black." My friend goes "What? I showed you the same picture before!" 

He opens his phone with the same picture and says "It's always been blue/black!" I see the same blue/black dress on his phone and I thought he was doing some prank on me. 

Turns out it was always the same picture, I just saw the white/gold the first time and agreed to what he said. While he saw it as black/blue the whole time and was talking about how he didn't understand how people could see it the other way.

Seeing it as white/gold seems a bit harder to me. But I tried to see it as white/gold and got it to work a few times. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've only read the first and I started with the second book. I noticed that the books seem to be missing another character (but isn't actually an important character) The prostitute from Winterfell who travels to Kings Landing. She pretty much bumps into the story with a few different characters. 

It's been a long time since I've seen the first few seasons. If I remember correctly, here's my simplified shitty story:

[She sucks off Tyrion, then decides to go to Kings Landing. Theon sees her as she's traveling to Kings Landing and throws her a coin so she could open her legs. Then she meets Lord Baelish in the brothel where she is taught more skills. Then gets to meet Prince Joffrey and reveals that he has a weird fetish. And then dies from Joffreys fetish.](/spoiler) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back up your files...

I used to use the same memory card on all my phones because it had more storage space instead of what the phones came with. This memory card was used ever since I had a nokia 5800 xpressmusic, so at least more than five years.

Side related story which lead to the useful knowledge:

My grandma had a guard dog that I knew ever since he was a puppy. Very loyal and smart, but had to be put down because of a weird illness. This was pretty tough for to handle and my parents were pretty bad with delivering the news. After that, my grandma decided to get a new guard dog which was still a puppy. This dog was pretty fun and all until a few years later, he had to be put down also... (Kind of a complicated and a long story, I can tell later about the dogs if anyone wants to know.) I was pretty sad about this too.

So you can guess what happens next. A year later, I lose my phone while I'm in a vacation abroad. Although I had lots of pictures from my first dog in my computer, there were still many pictures from him in my phone which were important to me. But all of the pictures from the second dog were gone. Two or three years of memories of that dogs entire life got lost.

I had many pictures in Whatsapp, but I could only restore my account information and not the pictures that I used to have. Luckily, some friends still had pictures of the dog which I sent through Whatsapp. I'm glad that I got at least some pictures back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saw Leafy's channel once, never again. The dude seems to have serious issues. Every video is about him ranting about someone. The one I saw first was about him going crazy about some popular cringy vine kid. I admit that the kid was pretty cringy, but him ranting about the kid for more than 10 minutes, and making four videos about him (each over 10 minutes) with the same ranting content felt way more cringy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was something that happened a year ago in Ukraine. Can't remember which way the story was, I think it was that the rebels in Eastern Ukraine claimed that the US provided Ukraine with stingers (Even though the rebels don't have any planes.) But some text in the stinger turned out to be the same as the text on a stinger model in Battlefield 3.

Edit: [Found the story.](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukraine-pro-russia-separatists-use-battlefield-3-stinger-missiles-accuse-us-weapon-supply-1512215) </TEXT>
