	<TEXT> I have been homeschooled my whole life.  I really appreciate it and have met a lot of great people through it.  As long as you meet other homeschoolers, it's great.  I have participated in sports at my local high school and have made friends there as well.  I, for one, really think it made me into a good person and I don't think you have the qualifications to say that no one should ever do it ever.  </TEXT>
