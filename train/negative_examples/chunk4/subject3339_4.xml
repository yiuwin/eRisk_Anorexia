	<TEXT> Who cares who made it as long as shit gets done.

America has been so ass backwards forever  you have had a good president who doesn't have Control of the house so nothing gets done. I'm not sure if your aware of this but most countries don't operate that way. As long as a party has majority control it can do what it wants for their term and if they do a great job they will get reelected if not they get a big boot out the door. So say what you will about it being Obama's bill just know it was majority Republican party that passed it  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Such ridiculous clickbait.
The experiment in question was pitting two neural networks against each other in a video game. Through a process of example, trial and error training, and experience these programs create and refine processes, like learning to play a game. The game went along the lines of, "whoever collects the most apples wins", and the units were allowed to knock each other temporarily out. They found that when apples were plentiful, they would focus on collection and when there was competition over a limited supply they would fight over them. There was no other possible outcome of this. These things have no self-awareness, or even really awareness of others. They just find the most efficient way to satisfy the win conditions.  

So there vulcans
