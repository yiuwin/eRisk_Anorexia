	<TEXT> Yeah, the program here in Texas is a five-year curriculum that requires service hours, lectures, planting gardens, judging honey contests, creating workshops, et cetera.  I'm just starting out, so I wanted the inside scoop on the program.  But if you're running 6000 hives, I'd say you don't need a certificate to be called a master beekeeper! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the response!  I have two questions, for starters.

1. Why did you personally join the program?

2.  The curriculum and requirements seem really rigorous at the higher levels.  What are you looking forward to (or fearing) the most as you work your way up the ladder? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm using [this top feeder](http://www.brushymountainbeefarm.com/10-Frame-Hive-Top-Feeder-w_Floats/productinfo/688/) from Brushy Mountain.  I assumed the plastic floats would prevent drowning, yet today's inspection revealed about 40 dead bees.  Does anyone have any commentary on this style of feeder?  Should I switch to a standard entrance feeder? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't believe it's technically honey if the bees are feeding on sugar syrup.

Edit:  the FDA has specific guidelines that say honey is made from the pollen of flowers.  Of course, I've only just started, so the veterans can correct me if I'm wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Former editor here.  That's not how it works in the catalog business.  Mann Lake has no in-house proofreader who gets paid to double-check the printed media they purchase from other companies.  Mann Lake isn't to blame for a pagination error in a catalog, but you can bet that someone at the printer's end of things is paying the price (I've been on that end before!). </TEXT>
