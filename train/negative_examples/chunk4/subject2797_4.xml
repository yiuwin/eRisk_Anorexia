	<TEXT> dude. Im just asking if its a good tool for the arsenal. I never said the only tool. I appreciate the effort put into this response but I dont think its all completely necessary. essentially I am asking for yes or no to the following question: while studying the concepts of Godels incompleteness theorems, are those logical puzzles completely useless? or do they have some merit? shouldnt be too insane to postulate an answer lol.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would appreciate a description of what it is like to have a job in this field. and what were your steps toward becoming a mathematician. did you earn your first degree in something other than math? how many hours a week do you work. and is this field worth looking into if you love math? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also forgot to mention the disrespectful way in which they think its ok to reject me. God for fucking bid I just get a simple no or no thanks outright and up front. noooooo. women like to lead you on first only so they can ignore you when you text them as their version of saying no or they agree to go out sometime only to come up with every excuse in the book not to fucking go out when you ask them. I fucking hate how these cunts think they can just treat men like shit and then turn around and bitch about womens rights.  </TEXT>
