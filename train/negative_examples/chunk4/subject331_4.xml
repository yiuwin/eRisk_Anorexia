	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is an idea I've sort of had for a while, mostly from seeing /r/anime. I've also recently seen some people mention wanting more discussion here, and /r/television can be light on content sometimes, especially as we head into summer. Basically AutoModerator would create a discussion thread for each episode as it airs - i.e. what already happens in most TV subreddits. The threads would not be stickied or distinguished and would live or die by the votes. The threads would start this Sunday night, May 1st at 9 PM EDT.

*Currently I've set up AutoModerator to create discussion threads for the following shows*: 12 Monkeys, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Arrow, Banshee, Fear the Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Gotham, Legends of Tomorrow, Orphan Black, Peaky Blinders, Penny Dreadful, Person of Interest, Silicon Valley, The 100, The Americans, The Flash and Veep.

Feel free to suggest other shows that should be added to the schedule that are either currently airing or soon to air. If the show has no real fanbase on reddit though I won't add it because then it's just extra work for me that won't matter. Or if you hate this whole idea in general or have other suggestions or questions then feel free to chime in.

***
As an aside I'm also curious for your thoughts on how Netflix/Amazon etc. shows should be handled that drop all their episodes simultaneously. Currently the series premiere discussion threads have an arbitrary limit of not allowing spoilers from after the first 4 episodes, but sometimes I can't enforce that as I don't have the time to go binge watch every show the day it comes out - nor interest or even a subscription sometimes. 

Sometimes people even report episode 4 spoilers despite their being allowed, adding to the confusion. And I see it as unsatisfactory to allow only spoilers from the first episode since most people will watch more than 1 episode, and allowing spoilers from the entire season would just keep most people out of the thread. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> /r/television is looking for new moderators! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-26 03:24:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1.  What are some of your favorite TV shows and TV show subreddits?

2. What timezone are you currently located in? When are you usually on reddit? How much time could you theoretically dedicate to modding /r/television on a semi-consistent basis?

3. Why do you want to moderate /r/television?

4. Do you have any prior experience as a moderator? If so, where?

5. If you could change, add or remove a rule for /r/television, what would it be and why? [See our current rule list here](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/wiki/rules).

6. Part of being a mod means dealing with unsavory things. Would you be able to handle dealing with verbal abuse, personal threats and shocking content while staying polite and levelheaded? Would you be able to handle being exposed to spoilers from TV shows, books and movies?

7. Do you use the browser extensions RES or Toolbox? These are extensions that modify the reddit website. If you do not use them, would you be willing to install them?

8. Feel free to mention any thoughts or ideas you have for /r/television or anything else you'd like to mention about yourself.

***
Part of the primary responsibilities you will be expected to perform as an /r/television moderator involve dealing with user issues over modmail, addressing user reports, and reviewing the links submitted to the subreddit and removing any that violate the rules. 

Other miscellaneous duties involve creating series premiere discussion threads, organizing and monitoring AMAs, creating awards show threads, handling surveys, creating flairs, updating the subreddit shoutouts, adding subreddits to the dropdown lists, and more. Mention in #8 any miscellaneous duties you'd be willing to perform.

***

Please post your response as a comment to this thread, do not modmail or PM any moderator your application. 

Thank you for your interest, and best of luck to everyone that applies.

*Applications are now closed. Applications may take a few weeks for us to process and select the new moderators, though I really cannot say for sure how long it will take us - could be a week, could be a month. All selected moderators will be invited simultaneously.*

	<TITLE> Submissions for /r/TrueDetective will no longer require tags </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-01 05:06:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all, if you have no idea what this thread is about, titles for submissions required something like [Season 1] or [Season 2] in the title or they could not be posted. 

Initially this rule was implemented to help people navigate spoilers for the subreddit, but ultimately to me the advantages I have seen are limited. 

It has made it difficult for users to submit content, especially if they have to deal with a cooldown timer (some users would have to wait 10 minutes to resubmit improperly tagged content due to how reddit works - we moderators could not remove that timer). It's also caused a lot of confusion for submitters.

Spoilers in titles are still not allowed, but going forward you should assume that spoilers for both season 1 *and* 2 may be present in any /r/TrueDetective thread, unless the title specifically indicates otherwise. For example, someone making a thread titled "Just started season 2, is it worth finishing?" - spoilers for the end of season 2 would not be allowed in that thread without spoiler tag code.

If you want, feel free to leave any ideas you have for the sub, whether you hate/love this change, and any other meta discussion.

P.S.: In case this timing is a little suspicious to you, this is not an April Fool's prank, and if it was, it would be a really lame one. </TEXT>
