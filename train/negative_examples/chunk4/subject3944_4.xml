	<TEXT> Sounds sexist? I know right?

But hear me out.. I'm so incredibly finicky about genders. To me, some Pokemon just "look" like a certain gender. For example; my Talonflame is Female.. It just reminds me of a female bird.. My Roserade? Female.. But something like Breloom.. to me has to be Male..

Am I seriously the only one who thinks this way? If I am, some help getting over it would be really appreciated.. I worked for two days getting this shiny HA Shroomish.. but I'm just sad that it's a female.. sigh..

And to add on to being honest, part of the reason I don't like the Female Pokemon is because I hate the shade of red used for the icon.. </TEXT>
