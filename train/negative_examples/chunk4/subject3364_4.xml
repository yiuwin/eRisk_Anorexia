Also can we please have Joong Ki, Gary and Lizzy back for the finale! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SG - Haikyuu. I like sport irl but I never considered watching a sport anime before Haikyuu. I checked it out and after a few episodes it quickly became my favorite show.

SB - Sword Art Online. This was the first anime I ever watched. I had been recommended by many to watch it and had seen some Youtube clips that looked intriguing. Holy crap. This show was so bad. It literally put me off anime for ages because I thought this was the best that anime had to offer.

Edit: Not trying to offend anyone who likes SAO by the way. Just my opinion. </TEXT>
