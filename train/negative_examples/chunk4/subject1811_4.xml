	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, I'm 20/M from Lithuania, I'm forever alone due to my stupid social anxiety, I don't really have much experience with girls, to be completely honest I don't think I ever had, maybe in middle school, but I'm just curious to try new things. I'm into photography, newest tech, sports, sometimes when the night sky is clear I do some astrophotography, occasionally I try to play something with piano, also I like to learn languages. I would prefer a girl to be same age or younger than me. Let's chat here on reddit first and move on from there :) If you're curious to see what I look like, here's couple of my photos https://imgur.com/a/wrxUJ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None of the examples of conversations we would give you work, because when the moment happens and you have to say something, everything goes blank in your head and the heart gets racing. So I think the first step in being interesting is to find a way to deal with that panic that hits you when someone asks you a question or says something about you, that is what makes you incapacitated and not interesting. I'm yet to find a way how to deal with the pounding heart, if I would be able to get rid of it, I imagine I would be so more free. </TEXT>

I rarely go outside, it's difficult for me in everyday social interractions, I deeply wish I could approach and talk to a pretty girl, but can't. I'm thinking going to the gym, but don't have courage yet to do it.  
I'm really looking forward discussing with people in this subreddit. I'm so glad that I have congenial people that I can relate to here. </TEXT>
