	<TEXT> my brother was about five and my dad asked us what we wanted for breakfast and my bro said "cereal with ketchup!" so my dad gave him that and made him eat it. He started crying because it was horrible and he was hungry so my dad made him sit on the floor and eat it. And he had it again at lunch when he couldn't eat it, so I ate it in the end. It made me sick. Not eaten ketchup since I was six
