	<TEXT> Every day talking do not make bond stronger in every case. My father's childhood friend lives hundred of hundred miles away from our city. My father and he wrote letters in 1970s  and my father still has it. Sometimes they talk on mobile but whenever my father needed he was spot on. Now they both are ill and cannot meet but both have great memories of each other. I do not have any problem with modern technology. I was talking nostalgic things. When you make card with your own hand you put effort and heart on it. Now we just forward single message to whole group of friends. I am also part of this era and me too use mobile, Internet chat etc. I am in third world country and I have scene that houses have broken apart with the miss use the technology, husband and wife are cheating, children are cheating parents so on and on. I am not saying it was not happening ago but now things are in limelight. </TEXT>
