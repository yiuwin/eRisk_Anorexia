Now there's a movie that just kept going and didn't know when to end.

I mean, argue all you want, I think Doug knows it's the truth. It's why his DVD exclusive reviews only have movies in the public domain/he already owns the rights to/are owned by a fellow CA reviewer, and have no clips outside of the movie he's reviewing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean like, er for example, when he cuts to the Greater Good clip from Hot Fuzz in his Top 11 Simpsons Episodes. He says "the greater good" and cuts to that clip as a joke. It's not critical commentary, he just ripped the gag from the movie, and then continues on talking about Simpsons like nothing ever happened. You could take out the Hot Fuzz clip and Doug's commentary would be exactly the same and the viewer wouldn't be confused, so trying to call that fair use probably wouldn't hold water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was never really an actor. He was in the business because he penned several early 1980s TV holiday specials, and him getting the lead on ALF stemmed from the fact that he was a pretty key behind-the-scenes force on the series (the ALF puppet was his and he was the one that pitched the show to Bernie Brillstein, who helped him develop it with Tom Patchett). So after ALF was over and the ALF movie came out in 1996, there was nothing to keep him in the business because he was never a live-action actor and his one puppet role was very niche. 

Also, he was uncredited for providing the voice/puppetry of ALF on every episode of the show + the movie, so I'm guessing acting was never really that big a deal to him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know that, but using a clip from a movie as a reaction isn't "parody".

For example in the Top 11 Simpsons Episodes NC (random choice but it's the first one that came to mind) [he cuts to a clip of Hot Fuzz for a joke about the greater good.](https://youtu.be/RqG2w3zInEw?t=251) That's not fair use, seeing as how it's not parodying anything. He just showed a clip from the movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The clips from the movie he's reviewing he uses could maybe be considered fair use if you stretched the definition to nano levels of thinness. But NC reviews are rife with other copyrighted material. You ever notice how often he'll cut to a clip of some movie/TV show as a joke? Yeah... that isn't fair use. Fair use for commentary is fine, fair use because NC needed a reference isn't </TEXT>
