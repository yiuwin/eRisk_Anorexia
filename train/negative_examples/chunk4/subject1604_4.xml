	<TEXT> This isn't a spoiler but wanted to make sure. Those of you who have seen the episode will know the part I'm talking about so I won't talk details. 
    Vane calls someone a "motherfucker". Is this period accurate ? I think "you cunt" would've been more fitting. I remember watching Boardwalk Empire (Set in the early 1900's) and Knucky hears Chalky or one of his men call someone a motherfucker. He has never heard an insult like it and has to ask his assistant Eddie about it. 
    Also, Flint says "yeah" to Silver at one point which I thought would've been better as a "yes" - clearly not a big deal though. 

Any thoughts ?

	<TEXT> Why would they do this ? 
    If, say, ps4 sell more consoles - it would make sense they would not want this to go forward if say that it is more likely that your friend buys a ps4 (which, in this scenario it is) then you would also buy one. 
    So doesn't this imply that microsoft is selling less consoles and so wouldn't be hurt anyway by this "effect" ? Thus there must be some other logic for them to want to bridge this void. 
    Any ideas ?  </TEXT>

Any ideas ?

	<TITLE> Bonjour, I am looking to have a historical French court song translated, if any of you can help. I have searched and found some translations but I can not be sure that they are correct as I speak only english. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The song in question: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJDLhajCCCE

From google translate; 

Aux plaisirs, aux dlices, bergres,
Il faut tre du temps mnagres,
Car il s'coule et se perd d'heure en heure;
Et le regret seulement en demeure.
A l'mour, aux plaisirs, au bocage
Employez les beaux jours de votre ge

Les ruisseaux vont aux plaines fleuries,
Cajolant et baisant les prairies,
Le doux zphir parle d'amour  Flore,
Et les oiseaux en parlent  l'aurore

Maintenant la saison vous convie
De passer, en aimant, votre vie.
Dj la terre a pris sa robe verte,
D'herbe et de fleurs la campagne est couverte.

Ce qui vit, qui se meut qui respire,
D'amour parle, ou murmure, ou soupire;
Aussi le coeur qui n'en sent la peinture,
S'il est vivant, il est contre nature.


The translation; 



The pleasures, the delights, shepherdesses
It must be the household time
Because it flows and is lost every hour;
And the only regret remains.
To love, to pleasure, to the grove
Use the best days of your age

The streams are the flowery plains,
Cuddling and kissing grasslands,
The gentle zephyr about love in Flora,
And birds speak at dawn

Now the season invites you
Moving, loving, your life.
Already the earth took her green dress,
On the grass and flowers countryside is covered.

Living thing that moves that breathes,
Love talking or whispering or sighing;
Also the heart that feels in the paint,
If he is alive, it is against nature.



I do not think these to be correct. The French lyrics I translated may have missed a few verses. 
    Any input would be greatly appreciated. 


    Merci beaucoup.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Red wine/smoked ham taste question - all help appreciated. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello, 
    I sometimes eat smoked wafer thin ham slices, in a sandwich. After drinking some red bordeaux the aftertaste reminds me greatly of smoked ham, I think. It could be something else I'm tasting. 
    Can any of you figure out what I'm tasting ? 
    
    Thanks in advance for your help.  </TEXT>
