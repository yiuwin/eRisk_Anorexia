	<TEXT> 1st, you're right about the Nerevarine, I forgot about the corpus. However the whole business with the CoC is much more complicated. We must first wonder if he still is able to roam Tamriel or what's going on. It's a really odd situation that is extremely difficult to answer and understand the implications of the event. I've spent quite a lot of tome with a friend of mine trying to work out what happened, we have all the mantelling covered though what happens after is trickier. Next time, don't just assume that I don't know what I'm talking about, seeing as this situation is the most complicated moment of mantelling in TES history, it is quite difficult to actually 'know' what happened.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> All of Middle-Earth vs all of Tamriel </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-26 15:45:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Assuming that everyone put away their differences and formed a mutual alliance. Let's assume that this happens before the events of the lord of the rings, and at the beginning of Skyrim. 

A giant portal opens somewhere in Tamriel to another plane, known as Middle-Earth. The high elves call council in Rivendell with all the great factions, so dire is the situation that even goblins, orcs and the ents are called to the council. Eventually it is decided that there must be war, and war there is. The armies of Middle-Earth March through the portal in attempt to conquer Tamriel. The citizens of Tamriel, seeing this act of war call the great nations together to retaliate, all the races are forced to truce to fight against this enemy. 

This is all out war, and there can only be one Victor, who is it and what strategies do they use to win? Assassins? Spies? Dark magic? Battle? There are no limits, though, it seems that even Alduin has delayed his plans and wishes to watch how things unroll (he won't fight). What would the end results be, will Middle-Earth prevail? or will it be defeated.

Edit: Middle-Earth - third era

Tamriel - fourth era

The combatants of the war are all trained warriors and mages/wizards. 

Also, this excludes the dragon born as he has yet to come into his power, and the Greybeards remain peaceful during the war.

However, Sauron somehow managed to get back the One ring and now sends his forces to attack Tamriel as well, he goes with them to fight with all the black captains and the Nazgl at his side.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> at my nieces birthday I was in the kitchen looking it the laundry and saw a 5-6 year old girl with blonde hair and a red and white polka-dot dress. She walked around the corner and I went after and she wasn't there. I asked around, and apparently there was no-one at the party that matched the description. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dave was bragging to his boss one day, "You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them."
Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, "OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?"
"No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it." So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,
"Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"
Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.
"No, no, just name anyone else," Dave says.
"President Obama," his boss quickly retorts.
"Yup," Dave says, "Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington," and off they go.
At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, "Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."
Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.
"Pope Francis," his boss replies.
"Sure!" says Dave. "I've known the Pope for years." So off they fly to Rome.
Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, "This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards </TEXT>
