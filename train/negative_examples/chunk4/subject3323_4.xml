Our LAST option is Yellow, it shines as if it came from the sun itself.

	<TEXT> I got gold cat from my ticket and I'm curious whether I should keep it, I'll keep it if it's rare and sell it if he's not worth having as a meat shield

EDIT: I decided to keep it, actually he's pretty good considering how I can upgrade him to lvl 30 compared to regular cat, and I beat their hard+ special so I got 1 million xp either way </TEXT>
