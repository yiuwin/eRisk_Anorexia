	<TEXT> what are you trying to get out of this?

I don't think many people care about the losses, both were horrible regimes. 
The Soviet's did have many more losses, many of which has not been given out by the Russian government.
many of these casualties were due to the "not one step back policy" of the USSR, it was the only way the Soviets could defend against the Axis in their prime.  </TEXT>
