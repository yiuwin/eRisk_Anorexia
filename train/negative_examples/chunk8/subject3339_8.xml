	<TEXT> Difference with vivint is they use cell receivers and wifi so the connection is alot harder to tamper with or so I'm told also They have different prices but will only give you the one option but they can be brought down and negotiate with.

I think the one they push is 79.99 a month and you get a bunch of sensors and cameras the other is like 49.99.

	<TEXT> Since we started using satellites and the internet and even then it's hard to say if we are doing it the most accurate seeing as the temperature on the ground and the temperature in the air are different. 

One of the reasons I hate these kinds of studies is the charts people show me are that they are comparing a temperature chart from 1980-2015 and dismissing everything else.


Couple Questions for anyone reading this.
1.how do we find out the greenhouse gas levels from the 1800-1970s as it would be really to narrow down that time range with ice cores.

2.if the hole we put in the atmosphere caused a period of cooling wouldn't it healing cause the temperature to rise?
