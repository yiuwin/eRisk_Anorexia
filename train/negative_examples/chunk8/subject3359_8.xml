	<TEXT> He's not the greatest caster and in a tournament a while back he wanted to cast the finals even though Semmler, Anders and Moses should've (The usual and "best" caster trio), so he got to cast the final and a lot of people disliked that. After that people just started hating on his casting in general, and now he doesnt even get hired anymore for any tournaments, not even by ESL even though he's working for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically: He let someone else who's a small youtuber upload a commentary video on his channel which was about anime and a lot of weebs got triggered, it's Pyro's most disliked video to date. (The like to dislike ratio at least) And he's apologizing to his viewers, that it was his fault and not Lando's. (the small youtuber) He also said he banned some people for his channel who just went too far with the comments, if people disliked the video and said they didn't like it he was fine with that, but he wasn't happy with the harassing comments and abuse towards Lando. 

Also LtCorbis unfollowed him on twitter and he got her to follow him back in a heated skype call. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think Lucio deserves a big nerf or something, I do think they should change back the wallrun ability so it's not infinite and actually has a skill ceiling to it rather than everyone can ride walls forever. 

For Zen I think a small nerf could be to change back the speed at which discord orbs move to the enemies because now it's basically instantly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess that's true that people would focus on getting kills way more, however for me it made me play slightly more defensive instead of being kill hungry. I loved getting those huge kill streaks like 25+ or something, but the reason you gave for removing it is a pretty valid one.

The main reason I find it annoying is because now the quickplay stats are way different compared to the competitive ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember that killstreaks used to carry on from round to round, it wouldn't say it on the screen but it still counted if you pressed tab. Why did they change this? It's kinda impossible to get those huge killstreaks again, my quickplay and competitive killstreaks aren't even close to each other now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So what we have to do is look at the game itself, look at the health of the community itself and say, OK, is this actually going to translate to TV? Counter-Strike lends itself perfectly. There are nuances, but at its very basic level, you understand it. We feel like a game like that translates really well. We just announced that were doing Overwatch. Overwatch is a first-person shooter. Again, basic concepts of the game, its very similar.

Have to agree that CS is one of the easier game to watch, it explains itself quite well after watching for a bit. Overwatch on the otherhand you'll probably have no idea what's going on most of the time as a NEW viewer. You kind of have to have played the game to understand it well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, he does have a point. S1mple definitely could be the best player in the world if he worked on his attitude and him tilting, I don't agree with him calling Niko the best though. That goes to Coldzera atm at least, I wouldn't call Niko the best until he and his team actually accomplish something  big. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's playing under Splyce atm and his stream is still doing relatively well.

When an article about a LAN he attended came out the whole Overwatch community just threw hate his way, for a poorly organised event which wasn't his fault. Seems like people will never let go of what he did in the past. A lot of them didn't want to give Steel a 2nd chance. </TEXT>
