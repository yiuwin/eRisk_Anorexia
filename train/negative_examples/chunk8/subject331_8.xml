	<TEXT> *Respond to me here if you notice any issues with the survey, or need a show added to any of the lists*. Any other thoughts on the survey are welcome.

* I know it's a pain, but the shows are listed in random order so that results aren't biased towards the top and bottom shows on the list. Use CTRL-F to find your favorite shows - if you're responding on mobile, most mobile browsers should have a search function by now.

* Only the first part of the survey requires an answer from you. All other parts are optional.

* It is okay to link this survey elsewhere on reddit, especially other television subreddits, mostly because I can't stop people from doing that anyways.

* I plan to leave the survey open for about 2 weeks, until Jan. 4th, but I might leave it up longer. You can edit your responses up until I close the survey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/Zippy0223, a now former mod, decided to vandalize the sub for whatever reason and basically messed with anything he could. He didn't even really do it all that well all things considered, he clearly gave up halfway on several things like deleting flairs or messing with user posts. If he actually knew what he was doing he could've done a lot more damage. I'm still in the process of reverting some of what he did, but I wasn't going to immediately drop everything to fix every last thing. I fixed the big stuff first, and I've now unlocked all the threads he locked. </TEXT>

I checked the [changelog](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases) and version for uBlock and it hasn't updated today which is when the issue began. I assume the problem is on reddit's end since nothing has changed user-side and that this update might somehow be a factor since it's the only recent CSS news I can find. </TEXT>

A pride of desert lions are so hungry they risk hunting a giraffe several times their size, while male sandgrouse fly 120 miles each day to the nearest waterhole and dice with death to collect water for their chicks. Filmed for the first time, a tiny bat does battle with one of the world's deadliest scorpions, and in Madagascar, a locust swarm of biblical proportions is seen as never before.
