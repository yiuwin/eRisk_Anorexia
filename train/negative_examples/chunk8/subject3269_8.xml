	<TEXT> ok, so im an idiot and it wasn't working and I went back to fix the bash profile file and I must have really messed something up because now whenever I type anything at the terminal it says `-bash: ls: command not found` or `-bash: nano: command not found`.  If you could help me fix this that would be fantastic thank you

Edit: I fixed the issue.  For some reason I still cant import pyqt4 from idle, but I will figure it out.  Thanks so much </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have idle, idle2, idle2.7, idle3 and idle3.6 at `/usr/local/bin/idle` and the following line is for the 3.6 version.  Should I just update it to be `#!/usr/local/bin/idle3.6`?

`#!/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/`

	<TEXT> ok great thanks that all worked and now I can run python from the terminal but when I use IDLE it still doesn't recognize PyQt4.  Do I need to update the path for IDLE as well? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I checked the 3.6 folder that python puts in my application folder, and it's not there, but when I run which python3 it's says /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3. 

I just realized I was checking my Library folder for the frameworks folder earlier and not the one higher up in the directory.  So I did look just now and it is there.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right I was thinking about that. I did use --with-python3 and it didn't work. It says pyqt-5.8.2 already installed.  The weird thing is if I go into the python 2.7 folder or the python 3.6 folder pyqt is not there.  </TEXT>
