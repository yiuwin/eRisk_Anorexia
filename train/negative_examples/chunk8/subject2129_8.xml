	<TEXT> It's good dude.

I think you need help on recording, It sounds a bit muddy.

Instead of an explosion of sound let each component breath, you have everything on blast.

Good idea! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Analog synthesizers especially, coming up with new ideas and sounds is all up to how creative you are.

All I play is my MicroKorg...I'm always finding new ways to create new sounds with it.

It's far from a very expensive synth,however , If your creative with it the MicroKorg has tuns too offer. 

It's not what you have, it's how you use it.

	<TEXT> Deer are such gentle curious creatures, Iv'e been studying them since I was a boy.

I came up with something cool, I'd climb a tree somewhere deep in the woods then drop a length of rope to the ground and gently pull it.

Out of Curiosity they'd come and investigate what is making that noise.

This worked for me several times and gave me a chance too see them up close.

	<TEXT>  running line and a T wrap 

PortaWrap is what is normally called, It is a steal device that is secured/tied at the base of the tree and is shaped like a T.

The running line is the rope you use to lower branches to the ground.

The proper way to lower big branches to the ground is to wrap the rope once or twice on the PortaWrap, This causes friction so that the guy on the ground(the groundsman) can safely lower branches that are a lot heaver than him so a situation like the one in this Gif does not occur.

Depending on the weight of the branch or log the running line is wrapped around the PortaWrap till adequate friction is obtained to be able lower the branch or log.


Without it everything would come crashing to the ground with no control.

With smaller less heavy branches the running line can forgo the use of a friction device,however, in this case it was needed.....It was a very stupid miscalculation buy the climber and groundsman to let this run. 

Hope this helps.  </TEXT>

I like the fact that he's trying to be different, he also from what I can hear has many different types of analog synths.

I can get the Timbre Wolf on the cheap but I'll stick to Korg. I have nothing but good things to say across all the Korg gear I've played over the years.

I have a lot of stuff I can trade perhaps I can find something more suitable. </TEXT>

I did a search for H mart  (Korean supermarket chain) In Texas and there are some, If your close to an H mart give them a try.

I prefer spicy kimchi... so if you like spicy go for one that is.

The great thing about H mart is they usually have free samples so you may be able to try it first.

I'm curious too see if you'll like it.


Edit: And I got downvoted

I wonder how that conversation ended..

"Do you know where the candle supply store is?"

Guy says"Yea I know where the candle supply store is, but you know what's on my mind right now? 

Old lady says"whats that?"

Guy responds" It's not how to get to the fucking candle store, it's your totaled smoking car in my loading dock!"

He does seem like a nice guy, Is he really funny or original though.


EDIT- I just want to elaborate that he does seem like a nice down to earth guy who is in no way off putting, I am just asking if fans of h3h3 actually find him funny. 


I'm just asking because he is obviously well loved.

I just can't figure out why people find him funny.  </TEXT>

Explanation

 The experiment shown here was carried out on the International Space Station to see how combustion happens in a 0g environment. They used a 50/50 fuel mixture of iso-octane and heptane, tested in a standard air environment (21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen at 1 atm). The results are quite interesting. The only glaringly obvious feature is that the flame looks spherical. The reason for that is simply that it has no reason to look otherwise. On Earth, gravity creates an axis that defines the direction of convection (i.e. up). In contrast, in the case of micro-gravity there is no up and gases diffuse with a spherical symmetry. An additional feature that is important is that the flame looks blue. That simply indicates that combustion takes place to completion. At times, you see parts of the burning droplet turn bright orange. The orange color indicates the formation of some soot, i.e. products of incomplete combustion. These then give off a bright orange color similar to a typical fire on Earth. Finally, you can see some fluctuations in the drop, e.g. where the orange patches show up. This asymmetry helps the dying droplet swoosh away in one direction before it runs out of fuel and disappears. </TEXT>

I did allot of research into this and even listened to a podcast where she was interviewed, we are never really going to ever know what her true motivations really are.

We are left with ...is this a joke on american culture or is she just a sweet Philipina girl who really loves a family tradition of eating McRibs and chicken nuggets.

In any case this is genius to me.  </TEXT>

There where some IRC chat logs floating around that where  purportedly his,however, the consensus deemed them to be fake.

I could see him using IRC because of anonymity, years ago when I was heavily into IRC i heard rumors he lurked around 7n music production channels and even worked a little doing DemoScene stuff...but who knows. 


I could see him being into the DemoScene.

For those of you that don't know what the DemoScene is here is a Wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Edgar Allen Poe i think looked at the world as a bit of a ruse a lie if you will, take for instance his poem bells.

Bells starts off with the imagery of wedding bells and holiday bells, joyless occasions then the poem dissolves into the dark sides of life, funeral bells and a maddening cacophony of clanging.

I find this to be his common theme, that underneath everything that is beauty lays an underbelly of misery and suffering.          </TEXT>

There needs to be more education available to expose this lie, further more, homeopathic medication should be illegal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Go to http://www.antique-bottles.net and post it, Make sure you take pics of the bottom.

That's the best way to learn more about it,sorry I could not be of more help I specialize in 1800's bottles so I don't know allot about crown tops.


FYI

Don't let anybody try to trade you for it until you know it's value, There are allot of bottle diggers/collectors that are well known scammers that prey on the novice/new collectors.

I have been raked over the coles before so I know.  </TEXT>

I get the feeling it's trying to say, being offensive just for the sake of being offensive  isn't really saying anything at all, And that social media has diluted our way of thinking with purposefully controversial click bait garbage? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Storyline

Alice lives on a ranch with her father, her favourite horse and confidante, Red, and the love of Red's life, Molly. One day her romantic world-view is shattered when her dad hires a stud horse to impregnate Molly. At the same time, her schoolmates are developing a sexual awareness that Alice can't decipher. As her family life deteriorates, and Molly's pregnancy unfolds, Alice must reckon with this raw and sexual world in a way she has not yet encountered.
The only person that can guide her now is the one eyed mad man called Rex, who lives locked in a cage behind the Barn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My guess is it's late 30's bottle you have here, in very good condition.

EDIT-  After searching I am mostly certain it's from 1937, The paint is perfect for that bottle.

From Wiki

The first product in the Royal Crown line was Royal Crown Ginger Ale in 1905,[4] followed by Royal Crown Strawberry, and Royal Crown Root Beer. The company was renamed Chero-Cola in 1910, and in 1925 renamed Nehi Corporation after its colored and flavored drinks. In 1934, Chero-Cola was reformulated by Rufus Kamm, a chemist, and re-released as Royal Crown Cola.


It may be from 1934...if it is, that really would be a gem.

	<TEXT> My guess is the girl was going to throw a lit candle in a bucket hidden behind the cardboard structure, after she throws the candle away,(into the bucket) two kids then raise a trough full of a flammable liquid to simulate a structure fire.


What I think happened is, she missed the bucket, that triggered one or both of the kids to get startled causing them to drop or spill the trough.  </TEXT>
