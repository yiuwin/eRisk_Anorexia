	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> According to [this graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#/media/File:US_GDP_10-60.jpg) depicting the American GDP in the 20th century, between 1939-45 the GDP doubled from ~$1T to ~$2T. This seems unintuitive - I'd have thought that the war would have redirected resources toward the war machine rather than domestic production. What happened to make GDP shoot up like that? Was the rest of the economy booming too? I'm assuming the war was the cause of the boom because the period of the boom exactly matches that of the war, and the GDP drops significantly after the war finished.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kind of agree. You can only dumb something down so much before the analogies and the "it's kind of like this but it's more complicated really"s start to work against you. I had a vague idea of roughly how quantum computers work (as much as some random guy on the internet with no experience and only a passing interest can have) but this just made it more complicated. And if I didn't already know a great deal about computer science (less of a passing interest and more of a degree) I would have been lost very early on. As it is I *only* got lost about halfway through.

I think if you're going to try to explain something very complicated like QC's, then you need to do either an hour-long in-depth explanation from scratch or a 2-3 minute overview which makes you feel like you've learned something but actually you haven't. This seems like the worst of both worlds in that it was netier informative nor easy to follow.

Just my thoughts.

	<TEXT> It's not a disorder. I'd say it's more of an "effect" that most people experience. For example the cringe and extreme discomfort felt by most people when they hear nails down a chalkboard, or that fucking polystyrene they use to package boxes which is literally the work or satan himself. It's horrible to hear. But it's just a sound. It's not really rational or sensible but it's a common effect that most people recognise - a negative response to certain sounds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember reading somewhere - maybe /r/CrazyIdeas? - that it'd be great to see a show where the world's top professional chefs compete against each other and try their best to impress a judging panel made of completely amateur food critics with no culinary experience. They'd get eliminated on entirely arbitrary grounds such as "no this has tomatoes in it and I don't like tomatoes". That'd be hilarious. I'd watch that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm that's true. Maybe they need to have at least 1000 score on the subreddit or something to make sure they qualify as interesting or impressive somehow. That'd limit the number of nominations by removing the uninteresting ones. The subreddit already, by nature of the reddit algorithm, acts as a filter to bring the interesting posts to the top, so we can use that to find good nominations that everyone agrees are at least interesting enough to be nominated.

We could further filter them by maybe saying they have to be in the top 20 (or whatever) of /r/overwatch/top when filtered by the "highlight" flair. That way there's a hard limit on the number of nominations, so if there's a particularly active month where 100 submissions get 1000 score, only the best 20 (or whatever) qualify. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Play of the Year - can we make this a subreddit-official process? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-13 16:18:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was quite excited at the end of last year at the idea of a "Play of the Year" contest where each submitted potg is voted on to find the best play of the game of the year.. People seemed supportive of the idea and enthusiastic to nominate and vote, but it sort of never really happened, which is a shame.

I know it's a little late for this, being mid-February, but can we look into some process for the 2017 Play of the Year in December? I think it'd be great fun. I don't *really* have much in the way of ideas myself, but I'm hoping we can brainstorm and get the mods involved so that we can arrange nominations and a voting process. 

Perhaps we could do something like a play of the month for each of the remaining 10 months, and the poty will be voted on between those? To be Play of the Month the clip would have to be potg in qp or comp, and there could be a sticky to vote on the best for each month. Voting should of course be handled by an external service for fairness, and anybody who sugests using First Past The Post for a voting system should be banned from not only this subreddit but the internet as a whole. 

I have a some decent experience writing bots so if we could automate the process I'd be willing to lend a hand there if people think that could be a good idea. I do love /r/vexillology's monthly design contest, which is mostly automated, so maybe we can use that as inspiration.

Leave a comment if you have a better idea. 

If we can get something going here I think it could be great fun to nominate and vote for potm and poty, and could be a great recurring game/thread/fun. I do enjoy watching and appreciating others' highlights and seemingly the community does too. 

Thoughts? </TEXT>

Gorilla arm is a term engineers coined about 30 years ago to describe what happens when people try to use these interfaces for an extended period of time. Its the touchscreen equivalent of carpal-tunnel syndrome. According to the New Hackers Dictionary, the arm begins to feel sore, cramped and oversized  the operator looks like a gorilla while using the touchscreen and feels like one afterwards.

It's basically a discomfort caused by using a vertical touch screen </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think under 8 or over 20, but not more than 50. 

Under 8 I can use for a little snack to relax at work or during the day. 

If I'm falling asleep I want something longer because it usually takes me about 15-20 mins to fall asleep. But I find that videos longer than about 50 mins will wake me up again after I've fallen asleep, so they should be long enough to send me to sleep but not long enough to wake me up again. 

Just my personal preference </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Regarding the reports we get on submissions like this: just because it has condoms in it doesn't make it adult content. As long as there's nothing sexualised in it, i.e. blatant porn or "sex sounds" etc, it's completely fine. Anything can make a tingly sound, including objects usually associated with sex, and as long as they're not being used for their, ahem, intended purpose, it's all good.

As always, we appreciate the reports so please keep them coming in, even if you're not sure whether something is ok or not. They're incredibly helpful for catching rule-breaking content faster. In this case we don't see a problem, but I wouldn't have reviewed this as quickly without the reports so it's always better to report if you're not sure. I'd rather have 50 reports to go through with one removal if that means we catch that one removal sooner. </TEXT>

I have a simple list of strings called `tag_list`, for example `["[meta]", "[question]"]`.

I used this line to check whether a tag was present:

    if (f in title for f in tag_list):
        something
    else:
        something_else

The condition was always returning true, so it was always doing `something` and never `something_else` regardless of the tags in the title. Even when I used an empty list in place of `tag_list`.

 The solution was to use [any()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any) around my condition:

        if any(f in title for f in tag_list):

Which works fine.

But I'm not sure why the first line didn't work. Why would it always return true? 

Just asking to learn :)

	<TEXT> Please read our rules at /r/asmr/wiki before submitting. 

Reddit catches all short links (i.e. goo.gl) and removes the submissioin automatically. This isn't something we can control - it happens site-wide. So this submission was automatically removed as spam by reddit as soon as it was posted. 

Also, we don't like people linking to their whole channel. Firstly it's blatant self-promotion, which people (including the mods) don't like, but secondly it doesn't allow fair voting. If you link to a single video then people can upvote it [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) it triggers them. Linking to a whole channel might invoke a mixed response so the votes wouldn't be representative.

Finally, [media] submissions should be links to journalistic reviews or stories about asmr, so your submission of a single video should be submitted with the [intentional] tag.

Hope that helps. I know the rules can be off-putting to new uers but they're there for good reasons to help keep the subreddit friendly, on topic, and free of spam etc. Let us know on modmail if you need anything - the link is in the sidebar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly it's surprisingly unreliable. The bot will assign the content creator flair automatically and I used to go off the channel name, but it would take people three tries even with their own channel name. They'd say for example "CGP grey" and it wouldn't find it because the actual channel identifier, in the URL, is "cgpgrey". There's other ways it can be confusing too. 

But secondly I don't want it to be an arbitrary channel tagger. That'd be a whole separate bot. It should only be for prominent asmr channels, and there's no (simple) way to check whether a channel name is an asmr channel.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We reused a common stylesheet from /r/Minimaluminiumalism, but when someone uses a bulleted list as follows:

* item 1
* item 2

it shows up in a sort of table. I just want the bullet points without the table styling. 

[Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/5l07di/meta_freeforall_friday_weekly_casual_hangout_and/dczkg3d/)

Any idea which part of the stylesheet I need to remove to get rid of the table? [Here's our current stylesheet](http://pastebin.com/PTR0QSC6). Thankyou! </TEXT>
