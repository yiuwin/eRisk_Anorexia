	<TEXT> I've slipped on ice sideways and tried to touch the ground before landing to soften my fall. It was too late to get my hand out completely so I extended my elbow. Elbow hits the ground, shoulder stays up while my head/neck hits it. It hurt like hell to my neck, but I was like 11 when that happened. I can imagine this could've been more serious if a full grown adult would've landed like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was pretty ok at this one game, but I got steamrolled by a kid who basically didn't do anything special in the game. So this answer is a bit different from the question. 

I used to play Shadow the hedgehog on my PS2 a long time ago. This game has a arena mode where you can fight with a friend and I was pretty good at it. 

So then I went to a vacation with my family and we stayed at some friends that my parents knew. This family has a kid who was about half my age during that time. He owned a PS2 with the same game and wanted someone to play with him. 

So we obviously play that since it's the only game that he understands/can play, other games were apparently broken because he didn't know how to play them. So we start the arena game and he just beats me straight away without doing much. I try everything in it but he just does one thing that makes him win almost every time. There's this square button in the game which causes the player to turn into a homing spinning hedgehog, and all he was doing was just spam the square button the whole time and it infuriated me! 

I keep trying different tactics while he just keeps spamming the square button and beating me. So I start to spam the square button too and both of the hedgehogs turn into a mesh of light bumping into each other and occasionally one getting a hit. This went on for a long time and I was trying to figure out where was the fun in this. He was just entertained throughout the whole spam marathon.

This is probably one of the perfect times where "don't hate the player, hate the game" would fit and oh my god if that kid would've known that phrase, I would've thrown him out of a window.

We tried other games (lotr and tekken) and he was really shit at it so he blamed that those games were broken. So we end up spamming the square button again in Shadow the hedgehog for a long time.... ^Yaaay... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know a house which has a secret door behind a painting that leads to an "attic". (Basically a long triangular space that's between the second floor and the roof.) The house used to have two dog booth holes in front of it and they lead into a basement under the house. 

The house is much smaller than the house in the game, but it does have more bedrooms and two bathrooms. It's pretty compact and spacious at the same time. I always wanted to recreate it in some multiplayer game and ever since I started to play Rainbow Six, this game would be the best place to recreate it. There aren't many shooters with crawling options and a siege map with places that you can get into through crawling would be cool new feature. </TEXT>
