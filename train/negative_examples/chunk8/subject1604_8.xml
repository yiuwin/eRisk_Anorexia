	<TITLE> Windows 10 update, lost files and programs. Any help appreciated. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm running windows 10, last night all was well, load up this morning and there must have been a system update. My desktop and task bar are all back to default, and the screen saver is vanilla too. Google chrome is gone. I used a chrome extension called one tab and had hundreds of tabs saved. All gone. 
    I reinstalled there but wondered if I can get it back. 

Some folders are missing too. There are no system restore points. I had some before I upgraded to windows 10, and I thought that the OS created restore points periodically for you. 


Any help is greatly appreciated. 

Thanks. ~~~~ </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Custom decision </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking to create a custom decision to change the flag and map colour of France from blue with the fleur de lys to white with the bourbon state flag under Louis XIV. 
    In the same way that you can form nations like Russia, without any game changing effects. 
    Can this be done without a lot of hassle ? 


Also, mods, when writing this title on the Reddit app I couldn't use spaces. Autocorrect added it for me. Thought I'd mention it. 


Thanks !  </TEXT>

    San Marino took in some general who was integral to the unification, then he allowed them to retain their independence. Other micro nations either are owned by very rich families or something similar. There have been a few ask historians posts about this.  </TEXT>
