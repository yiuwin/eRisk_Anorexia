	<TEXT> I agree. I get the desire people have to yell at former supporters of the Trump train, but honestly, I don't see why. It will probably just alienate them, when I find them pretty reassuring. Maybe I'm too soft (mostly because I think that myself from a few years back definitely would've gone for Trump) but I like when they pop up, it's not like we don't want people turning against Trump. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably the weakest IRS album but still very solid. I'd say the best songs on it are Feeling Gravitys Pull, Driver 8, Auctioneer, Green Grow the Rushes, and Cant Get There from Here (honorable mention: Life and How to Live It). Despite some very impressive highs it's brought down because of three tracks that can't get into at all, these being Kohoutek, Old Man Kensey, and Maps and Legends. I'd rank it a 3.5/5.

Oh, and one other thing: The B-side to Driver 8, Crazy, is stellar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reagan was Governor of California for 8 years before he was president. Regardless of what you think of either, he was far more qualified than Trump. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the best part was when Graham Chapman stated that he knew John Cleese had not read the book. This contrasted quite humorously with Cleese's above statement, where he appeared to have read the book based on the fact that he gave an opinion on its quality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still see it pop up occasionally. Even as someone who leans left it's pretty damn stupid. Trump ancestor changed their name when he came to America, how exactly does it matter that he didn't revert to it? I could've tolerated it if it he just went "lolzers drumpf sounds funny" but he tried attaching the Stewart thing to it, which isn't an equivelant. </TEXT>

And yes, Trump has tall genes in him. His first son Don Jr is a pretty average 6' but Eric Trump is 6'5" and Ivanka is 5'11". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't really make sense though. Trump never changed his name, it was done way, way, back, he kinda didn't really have a say in the matter. Stewart dropped his surname himself. I liked Oliver's segment but the Drumpf stuff is cringeworthy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Harry Shearer is getting up there. He's 73 next month, and has a notable lack of interest in the show (remember when he quit for like 2 months last year?). 

Also Kavner's age definitely shows. It's not her fault, of course, but Marge's voice has devolved over the years into a really harsh croak and it's painful at times to listen to. I can't imagine what she'll sound like when she's 76 </TEXT>
