	<TEXT> The sapphire staff of Moses (aka the [staff of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_of_Moses#Alleged_present_location)).
As per Sefer Hayashar, the staff was no ordinary staff that Moses used. It has a long history beginning with Adam - Noah - Shem and his descendants - Abraham - Isaac - Jacob - Joseph - Jethro runs off with it and plants it in his garden. The staff was said to be so heavy that none could wield it without divine assistance. From there, many mighty men seeking Zipporah's hand in marriage tried to pull the staff but were unsuccessful. When Jethro saw the staff in Moses' hand, he gave him Zipporah as a wife.
So, whoever finds the staff in today's age, and manages to wield it with divine assistance, would basically be the true Messiah. Doubt there's any inanimate object closer to being associated with the true Messiah than the sapphire staff. There's many references to it all over the place, and in various religions too. Would be interesting to find it in its current location, and take turns trying to pull it King Arthur style. </TEXT>

The next challenge is how to uncheck a checkbox. And for this, you can use radio checkboxes. Combine that with multiple labels and labels which swap out other labels, and you basically have a piece of machinery that can evolve into a gear-like operating system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, that's assuming the generalization is always true regarding any two minds we compare. Yet there is some fuzzy logic at work due to the term "alike" which allows some difference. If we relied on just the "thinking alike" aspect, the little-known second part of the saying is "fools seldom differ". So perhaps thinking alike is actually a sign of foolishness rather than being "Great minds". Perhaps A, B, and C are all great minds because A thinks like B and B like C while A and C differ. All three are great minds due to the positive aspect of the saying while the negative aspect is ignored due to fuzzy logic. The point is you can't bring a proof from such a saying as perhaps both her and I are actually great minds, just we're A and C which I believe is the case. Knowing I'm a great mind, I was hoping to fulfill the positive aspect of the saying by finding someone that thinks like me. </TEXT>
