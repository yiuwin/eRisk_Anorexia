	<TEXT> In August 2008 when I was 18 and was studying computer science, I began to lose my eye side. After some months I was almost blind. Because of unawareness I left my studies for 3 years. My one relative told us about a blind center in the city. I, my elder sister and my mother went their to see their system. I began to learn "Braille" their and restarted my studies. Now I have done graduation in History and political science.

I am working on daily wages where I get 5.50 dollars per day. I am from a middle class family and after my blindness first time I felt how difficult is a disable person's life in a third world country. I want to make a well fare organization for poor, needy and disable persons.Prey for me. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Way is not in the sky. The Way is in the heart.

Happiness is a journey, not a destination.

Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship.

To be angry is to let others' mistakes punish yourself.

Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else;you are the one who gets burned.

Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be
shortened.

You will always be getting praise and blame,but do not let either affect the poise of the
mind.

An outside enemy exists only if there is anger inside.

There is nothing so disobedient, as an undisciplined mind, and there is nothing so obedient, as a disciplined mind.

Happiness never decreases by being shared. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> on a sunny day in the spring of 1906 the Miles brothers filmed the journey down Market Streetfrom 8th street down to the Embarcadero from the front of a street car, where the streetcar ends it's journey, and is turned around for the return trip
up Market Street again. On the day before the earthquake the brothers put copies of this film aboard a train headed for the East coast, unaware that the
very next morning the landscape of downtown San Francisco would be changed forever, with this one film that would show us a hundred years later what thatstreetcar ride was like.  </TEXT>
