	<TEXT> It shouldn't harm them if you keep the chlorine level low enough. Ducks are pretty tough birds, they can thrive in almost any kind of water as long as there are some tasty algae and micro-animals to eat.

If you go too heavy on the chlorine, these guys will just leave, don't worry about them. It all depends if you wish to keep the ducks to swim in your pool or not (but remember, ducks defecate and urinate as they eat, so I wouldn't swim in a pool that has ducks living on it).

It's up to you, whether you still want these guys around or not. If it's just to give a cleaner aspect to the water, a bit of chlorine won't hurt them in any way, but it is surely going to kill what they feed on :) </TEXT>
