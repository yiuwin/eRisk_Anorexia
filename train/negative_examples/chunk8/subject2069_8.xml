	<TEXT> Im going to say i prefer it to the first movie.

I dont think it was really a cop out. In a lot of ways it was a bold, bold move, killing off two fan favourites. And it served the purpose of the narrative, that the alien cost ripley everything she loves. It was a bleak narrative, but a good one in my view. And ripley eventually returns the favour, even if she lost her life. </TEXT>

Shes clearly a woman, just a super strong, fit athletic lady.

Im a fat dude so id never have a chance with her, but i honestly think shes one of the most beautiful women ive ever seen. Theres nothing manly about her at all.

Ive seen this comment a few times and i guess it just bugs me for some reason. Like i dont get how a woman being fit and strong and healthy is somehow bad or manly. </TEXT>

She stated: Ridley asked Neill not to make our Alien 'til after Prometheus 2; he wanted his movie to shoot and be released first.

	<TEXT> Yep. But Ridley only wanted the universe to himself which is really unfair considering its not his baby. His original film, while classic, isnt even the best in the series. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was never too pleased about not being asked back after aliens, and when the blokamp sequel started getting traction, he decided to suddenly make a new alien movie. Asking neil to postpone his movie, only to shut it down because he wants to do more himself, was kind of a shitty movie imo. And i respect ridley a lot, just dont think he handled it well  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never got the hate for it. I loved aliens too and i did miss seeing newt and hicks, but i thought this is a beautiful, bleak piece of film making that wrapped up ripleys story nicely. The ending is one of my favourite movie scenes ever. Fantastic soundtrack. Love everything about it. </TEXT>

I wont ever defend or vote for anyone that not only represented someone they knew was guilty, but got them out of jail. It doesnt matter to you because it wasnt your kid he fucked. You might feel differently if it was. </TEXT>
