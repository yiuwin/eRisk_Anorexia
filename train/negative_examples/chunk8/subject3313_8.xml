	<TEXT> at vs, we're told that it's 75% of women wearing the wrong bra size! even if they're wearing their sister size, it might not be as good of a fit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> when you buy a new bra, you want it to fit comfortably on the loosest hook because it'll stretch out as you wear it; that way you'll have the room to tighten your band and still get the same support! that's why they put you in a 34 :] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's called a sister size. So, say a 34C fits well in the cup, but the band is too big. You go down in the band and up in the cup = 32D which is essentially the same cup size, just 2 inches smaller in the band. Now, if a 34C fit in the cup, but was too tight around, and you go up in the band size, you go down in cup, making 36B an equivalent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i just googled vast amounts of pictures of katy just to look at her boobs. as a victoria's secret employee, i'm pretty sure they're bigger than that; a 32D is only equivalent to a 34C (don't be fooled by the letters!). </TEXT>
