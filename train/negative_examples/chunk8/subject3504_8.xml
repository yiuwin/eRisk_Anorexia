	<TEXT> Here, in America, the common foods are:

Breakfast: Eggs, Bacon, Toast/Bagel, Oatmeal, Cereal, etc..

Lunch: (Could be anything) Maybe left over dinners or sandwiches?

Dinner: Mac   Cheese, Vegetables+Meat Combos, Potatoes, Steak..

Stereotypical items eaten, not always accurate because I honestly eat eggs at all times of the day.

What do you guys eat? Indian breakfasts? West indian dinners?

I just love cooking haha </TEXT>
