	<TEXT> Retail store manager here.

We do mixed case discounts of 10%
Solid case discounts of %15
That's to our customers.

When we buy wine from distributors, the discounts per case are typically around ~5% a bottle. In some cases (ha pun) when we buy more than say, 4 cases, it'll go up- but that's not often. </TEXT>
