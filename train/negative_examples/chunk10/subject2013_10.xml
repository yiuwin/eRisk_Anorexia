A law firm won $50 million for Trump Entertainment but then had to sue its former client after Trump Entertainment tried to avoid paying its legal fees by claiming bankruptcy: In 2008, the law firm Levine Staller began filing tax appeals for the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza, and Trump Marina. Its work saved Trump's company lots of money: In 2012, Levine Staller won a settlement that returned $35 million in overpaid taxes and cut $15 million from the company's future liabilities, leading to a total savings of $50 million for the corporation. Trump agreed to pay $7.25 million to the law firm in legal fees, but then only paid Levine Staller $6 million before trying to claim the rest as unsecured debt in ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. In response, Levine Staller sued its former client, Trump Entertainment, and in 2014, a judge rejected Trump Entertainment's request to be absolved of this debt and told the company to pay up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was wondering whether anyone had some good book recommendations on various dictators in history.  I find that reminding myself of past events tends to help me deal with a chaotic present, so I figured reading about historical dictators might help me a little bit with what's going on.  Any recommendations? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously, it all depends on how dictatorial things get before he's gone, but right now, with Trump's track record, I'm not entirely disappointed Clinton lost.  Had she won, Trump would be talking about illegal votes stealing the election, she'd have a Republican Congress that would never work with her and would refuse to confirm her SCOTUS pick, and all his voters would claim to be martyrs.  I'm hoping Trump sucks so badly that the fever breaks and we can get back to rational politics. </TEXT>
