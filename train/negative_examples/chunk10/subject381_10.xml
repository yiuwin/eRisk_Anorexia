	<TEXT> Most of them before all of this where not racist, and generally close to left or normal conservative to begin with. When people started calling them racist, sexist, bigots, etc. The wouldn't stand for it at all. Do then they retaliated by being extremely anti-left and adopting racist beliefs, ones they barely any of them deep down actually believe. These people are not the most sociable people, so they would be completely willing to be attacked for it, since by then, tons of people where with them. </TEXT>

Nobody is dying for/over/in Crimea. There is other fighting in Ukraine that may or may not be supported by Putin. Most Russian people legitimately support Putin, as he increased GDP after the fall of the soviet union among other things
