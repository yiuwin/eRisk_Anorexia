	<TEXT> Well let's see. 
hasnt made a significant change to his system at all until the switch to a back 3 recently
failed to introduce any sort of pressing system

I don't have time to scour the web for proof but the best example I can think of was 1 maybe 2 seasons ago, when Arsenal were doing poorly around December and with a trip to City approaching, he switched to a pressing form of the regular 4-2-3-1. Cazorla was moved to a holding mid position, alongside Coquelin, where they both excelled for the rest of the season. 

failed to organise his defence in any way even with painfully average defenders

Firstly, if you think Mustafi, Koscielny, Bellerin, and Monreal are painfully average, then you're either a troll or somebody who has never watched them play and draws their football knowledge entirely from memes on r/soccer. Besides that, Arsenal's worst defensive performance in recent seasons came in 11/12, right after the last mass exodus, when they had the 8th best defense. Since then their defense has been the 3rd best in the league twice, the 2nd best once and the fourth best once. 

But, hey, who gives a flying fuck about these figures. Arsenal is shite.

	<TEXT> So true. I hear they still use babies as the main form of currency over there. God forbid they wisen up and switch to something more practical like paper money. </TEXT>
