	<TEXT> It'd be the 15th of August actually. Sometimes it's not the same date due to days in a month fluctuations, but the bot [uses 92 days](https://github.com/Theonefoster/asmr_bot/blob/master/asmr_bot.py#L935) (7948800 seconds) to represent 3 months as a compromise because it most often lands on the same numeric date. 

Although [it only updates its repost database once per day](https://github.com/Theonefoster/asmr_bot/blob/master/asmr_bot.py#L986), so there can be between 0-24 hours extra added depending on exactly when the post was submitted. But at 2:01am (GMT) after 92 full days after the original post, you can post it again </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can anyone give any tips on how to create a gif from a clip of a video? I've got some clips I'd lik to share, but they're in ultra-high quality and some of them are 15 minutes long. I need a way to trim the clips down (so to just the highlight rather than the full 15-minute saved game) and reduce the quality before I turn it into a gif. It seems like it should be simple to trim a video, yet I can't find a way to do it (except upload the entire multi-gigabyte file to youtube, use youube's embedded trimmer, then re-download the resulting video. I'm not doing that.) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I like the convenience of previewing what a text message says on the lockscreen, but I don't like the idea of other people reading my messages, so I have the setting configured to not show the preview. 

When I'm at home, where I live alone, I don't have to worry about people reading it, so the message preview should be showed.

Does a tweak exist to change this behaviour based on a geofence? Or maybe connected to a specific wifi network? (although sometimes I use 4G at home as my wifi is unreliable in certain rooms). I'd imaging it could be expanded to change all kinds of other options. You could have a whole different set of privacy settings for when you're at home vs away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're ok using the command line (type "cmd" into the box that pops up when you press Win+R) then you can start a timer which will shut down the pc. The command `shutdown -s -t 3600` will shut the computer down in 1 hour; change the 3600 value to the number of seconds on the timer. You should get a notification telling you you're about to be logged out in 1 hour (or whatever value you entered).

If you want to make it a bit easier to do regularly, create a text file on your desktop and paste in just that command. Save it as `shutdown timer.bat` and you'll be able to run the command by double clicking it.

edit: some professional level detective work on my part reveals that 25m is 82.02 feet, so perhaps it makes sense that the actual height defined by the law is 25m which is roughly 83 feet when rounding error and/or misremembering figures is considered. This is speculation by me though.  </TEXT>

I wouldn't watch a video with a half-naked guy, and similarly I don't want to watch a video with a girl who's practically got her boobs out. Girls can dress however they please and I'm not saying there's a dress code we should uphold, but at a certain point it's just soft porn and is completely distracting from any asmr that might have been experienced otherwise. You seem to think that innocent girls who just happen to like dressing in a certain way are being accused of sexualising themselves, when this is the opposite of what's actually happening: they know exactly what they're doing, and tbh it's a cheap trick used to gain views from young teenage guys. I don't want to click on stuff like that. It's uncomfortable. </TEXT>

This is probably against site-wide rules and is certainly against subreddit rules: 

For Content Creators

YOU CAN:

* Post your new content as it comes out

* Participate in discussions in the comments of a submission of your content

* Solicit the community for ideas, suggestions for future videos, etc.

YOU CANNOT:

* Post the same video/content more than once to attract more viewers (deleting and reposting your video is also obviously prohibited).

* Post multiple of your own, or any one channel's, content per day (unless you actually produce more than one work daily)

*  **Solicit the community for money (kickstarters, etc.).**

This is a great way to get your account shadowbanned site-wide. Comment and submission removed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really think you're thinking about this backwards. You're taking it upon yourself to take content creators content, for which they're not directly getting paid  
 as a result (whether that's your or YouTube's fault is irrelevant), and then you're asking for them to approach you to arrange a cut of the money you've made off it, which you've not even given an estimate for. There are (tens of?) thousands of content creators on YouTube, so expecting all of them to hear about your app, go to the effort of approaching you, have all of them agree to have their content hosted on your app and agree to your terms, and then somehow paying them for their content after all of that, is ludicrous. You're going to end up with hundreds to thousands of content creators who have no idea you're making money off of their content. 

The way you should be thinking about this is as a platform, like YouTube is at the moment. The arrangement between a content creator and YouTube doesn't exist until the content creator approaches YouTube and gives them their content, and their consent for YouTube to host and distribute that content. They can choose not to do this if they don't like the terms, but in this case YouTube doesn't then take their content and show it anyway. You should arrange a process for content creators to approach you and *give* you their content in a mutually agreed arrangement. You can approach them to make them aware of their option to open an agreement with you, but taking their content without their knowledge or consent and then making money off it is wrong, even if you mean well.

It's not my place to suggest any business model or particulars of arrangements made with content creators, but all I care about is whether they have an agreement with you when you use their content on your app. Even if you're not making money off it, which sounds like the case at the moment, you're taking revenue away from creators. And it sounds as if you plan to make money off it in the future.

It sounds as if you have put a lot of work into your app but you need to approach it differently if you want to succeed, and especially if you want the approval of the community. What you're doing at the moment is stealing content, whether you think you are or not, and whether you mean well or not.  But the current setup is benefiting you and only you, and we can't allow you to advertise such an app on the subreddit. As I said before, if the app changes tack we'll be open to discussing it again. And I think it would be a great idea to brainstorm with the community how you could approach making a dedicated platform in a mutually beneficial way - it *could* be a great idea. 

So what would it take for us to allow discussion of the app here? The only thing from my perspective is an agreement with the creator of every video that shows up on your app. If they don't agree to your terms, you don't show the video. And an absence of response is not agreement. 

I hope this works out in a positive manner for everybody involved because it sounds as if it could really help both content creators and viewers, if it's done in the right way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have an anti-apple circle jerk? I love apple's stuff. My point was that the article was far longer than it needed to be to get the point across. I understood the point fine (that apple legally has no choice but to charge a nominal fee for the software), it just took too long for the journalist to say. It felt padded. 

It wasn't even *that* bad, I just noticed it as a throwaway comment

And, incidentally, I read the very paragraph you quoted after the article left me wondering what the SO act was since it didn't really explain it. So I did do my own research. I'm really not sure why you felt the need to write that comment because it was exactly 100% unnecessary, and seems to commit the very crime it accuses me of - jumping the gun and being misinformed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've removed this thread and we won't be allowing any further submissions about the Tingles app until the concerns that have been expressed in the comments have been addressed. It sounds like a great app for the average watcher (although I haven't used it myself), but the question of monetisation and paying content creators for their work has been raised several times and a satisfactory answer has not been provided. Until the developer can answer these questions to the satisfaction of the mods and community, its advertising won't be allowed on the subreddit.

I'm open to this being a miscommunication and the possibility that this could be a great app for everyone, but the information we currently have is very limited and to be honest it sounds like it's taking content creators' content without permission and using it to make money without a cut of that money going to the creator.

Heather (/u/sailorchell) expressed these concerns very well in [this comment tree](https://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/65yig2/im_a_designer_of_tingles_asmr_app_free_for_ios/dgexaeh/), so answers should be provided there or in reply to this comment.

And I'd like to remind everyone that linking to "backups" or otherwise rehosting of deleted content is against the rules and will earn an instant ban. If a content creator has removed their content we should respect their right to have it removed from the internet, even if you enjoyed it in the past. As always, requests for deleted content will earn a temporary warning ban and links to or hosting of deleted content will be a permanent ban. </TEXT>
