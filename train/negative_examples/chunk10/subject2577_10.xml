	<TEXT> Being single as a male vs being single as a female.

My sister and I are both in our our 20s.

When people ask me why I'm single I tell them (the truth), that I'm not looking at the moment. This has never been challenged.

When my sister says the same thing, every single time she is told 'have you tried this app', 'oh this website is good', I hear 'x' is single.

It's weird that society won't accept that a women is single by choice but for a man it's completely fine and won't be challenged. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alhambra, I pronounce the h, mostly because it winds up my grandmother.

In Spanish I deliberately mix up aguila and anguila, eagle and eel.
My dad's favourite show is la aguila roja (the red eagle) but whenever I mention it I will call it la anguila roja ( the red eel) and it seriously winds him up.

If I hear someone say the word scone, I wait for the nearest moment in conversation when I can say scone too but I will say it the opposite way to what has previously been said. 9/10 I can see the person thinking 'am I saying it wrong or are they' :D :D :D

I called skype, skypey as a spanglish joke but then my family forgot it was a joke and now they all say skypey, and there's even a few non family members that call it that now. I've created a monster :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In my 15 years of going to Starbuckses, I've gotten the douchey "correction" exactly twice. Both times, I switched to a grizzled Southern accent and said "I don't speak no Italian".

I do the opposite and in Italian, say "oh you speak Italian, I have a question, why does it say latte up there but when I order it I don't get a glass of milk"?

Only happened a handful of times but every time there's a long pause whilst I wait for an answer, knowing they don't speak Italian, which is then followed by them making my drink and me saying thankyou.

	<TEXT> My paternal uncle's wife cannot have kids and my maternal Aunt cannot have kids. 

So that's cousins out.
My sister cannot have kids so that's nieces/nephews out.

If I don't have kids my entire family tree will die out. No pressure :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The trouble here though, is you also have feminists that believe woman  men and they're the ones who screw up the message and have tainted the word 'feminist'. 

Plus as others have said feminism is a terrible word/name; putting gender into a name is why many men associate it with misandry.

At least egalitarian is gender neutral and still promotes equality for all. </TEXT>

Though I guess it helps that Columbus day is also dia de la Hispanidad/raza (for us Latinos) so I guess if you're having a big party anyway, may as well chuck in a marriage in there :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you miss a run, don't try to catch it up later. Just mark it as a miss and move it, in the grand scheme of things it won't make a difference.

I used to always eat scrambled eggs and toast before a big race. But my long runs were always on saturday mornings, so every Saturday I ate the same eggs and toast (the odd toast/herb tweak here and there but generally the same).

I think it's important to get used to having the same meal before a long run. Quite often on marathon day inexperienced runners will eat a breakfast that they don't normally eat and it can throw their running off.

For hydration, get used to drinking roughly a certain amount of liquid (adjusting for weather) when you train on your long runs. As you have water stands quite often at every mile, a lot of runners get caught up in the moment and guzzle too much water and that really hampers your running. I personally made that mistake when I went from 10ks race (not water required) to my first half marathon.

Music wise I tend to to work out throughout my training what songs motivate me and make a special running playlist with it.
I also helps it keep you on track time wise, so when x plays you know if you're ahead/a lil behind of where you should be.

I also have always had the exact same song (which I can skip to if I'm setting a pb) when I get down to the last 500m so that when I get to 100m the song is peaking and it motivates me to sprint the last 100m, which fyi when your family wants to see a video of you doing the marathon, it always looks cooler when you sprint.

When I did the Berlin marathon as I was the only one full on sprinting the last 100m the announcer/dj actually called out my name and played viva espaa (I'm Spanish). Honestly it was an amazing moment and it looks hella cool on the video. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ability to pass every drink/drug test there is.

We're not allowed to drink at work/during work hours (office job, no reason for that rule). We also have a few office cunts that love to get people into trouble.

I'd go out with them for lunch, order a few drinks maybe smoke a joint. Then when they report me I'll claim harrasment when my tests come back clean. :D

	<TEXT> For me it's when I see someone I don't know just having a shitty day and I can see they're about to break and I go over to them and ask it them want to just talk.

Obviously not everyone says yeah but for the ones that do, honestly over the years you wouldn't believe the things people have told me, and I can see just having that one conversation where they just take and step back can just unload makes them feel better.

And knowing that by just listening to them has made them feel a bit better always brightens my day. </TEXT>
