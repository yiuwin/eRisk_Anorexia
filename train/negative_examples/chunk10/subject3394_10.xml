	<TEXT> It seems like I can't find a legitimate answer to this question. My US history professor claimed that the civil war was Lincoln's attempt at holding the union together, because had the confederate states been free, they would have been allowed to secede from the union. But after a lot of research, I have found a different side to it; this side claiming that the civil was solely about the southern states wanting to secede in order to keep the institution of slavery intact. So which is it? </TEXT>
