	<TEXT> That's an amazing question. I think about it often and even have gone as far as try to avoid pain all together in my work. I feel it is not something someone would generally want hanging in their house unlike my cityscapes.   I realize now that it is the core of my work after going through some hardship and feeling the pull of expressing it. Just last week, I  have people in my life that are suffering(cancer, divorce, violence) and I am not physically involved but am on a spiritual level, in helpless pain.  I am frustrated and that is the reason for the expression, it's not only to communicate to others but also to express in a form of therapy for myself. When I create the work about pain and am IN the actual pain, there is no hesitation, no mistakes, nothing to compare the work to, it is just pure getting lost to the process and I find resolve in that. I can come to terms about certain things after finishing the work, like the pain and torment and anguish is always going to be a part of life. It is such an important part of the universal human condition and such hardships really do impact the way you perceive the world around you.  After doing this piece for myself, I was sent many messages of what the piece meant to some of my closest friends and that came as a shock. Some of them were dealing with dark histories of drug abuse or something else and it makes the piece that much more important. They said something along the lines of "I never thought I could communicate how I felt after   *blank*   happened, but when I saw your painting, I suddenly knew what the pain visualized into" 

Sorry I think I just ranted </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I have a few friends who have seen this piece and are in love with it just because they have felt this way in some dark times, withdrawing from drugs, etc.  I think it's all relative, something "overdramatic" to myself might be someone's reality and it's important to remember that.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeasss!!!  I love the way the palette knife can create tons of textures with ease. I wanted to make it clean and rainy and accidently got his skin ton in the background but enjoyed that disintegration look. Like part of his spirit is in the wind and the sword had just striked. It could have been cleaner looking but I enjoyed when it's a moment captured in time, especially one of a chaotic nature.

	<TEXT> yasss!!!! It's incredible. Really reminds me of Aang's internal conflicts. This however, is on a whole different level when he contemplates suicide, etc. It's so powerful with such minimalistic design choices. I think I'm doing another piece on Jack meditating, there has been a ton of those introspective moments this season. My first choice was from ep. 2 when he's hiding and his older self is yelling at him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One painting session. Mostly wet on wet using liquin. You can see the first layer was very loose so I kept those for the layers in the sky and street ground but built up the warm lamp lights and darker defining structures. Thank you </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Na, I enjoy the center for this one. Not everything is absolute. Just because it's in the center doesn't mean it's a shit composition. I don't have any other elements leading the eye around the piece to a focal point. It's essentially a "portrait" of the man on the boat. Simple as that.  You're assuming I don't know composition from this one piece. What if I made those choices deliberately? How do you know I don't have other pieces with good composition?        Maybe you're the one who doesn't understand composition and what it's for(not to follow obsessively, but to learn it and break rules for the sake of storytelling). But really at the end of the day, if  people like it and feel something from it, then who really cares ? I'm not mad or anything. It's kind of a cool "debate/argument" .   Having a great day :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah me too. You know that's gotta be the hardest thing to do as an artist, at least to build that skill of not "over-doing it".  Sometimes I post my work in progress as I create and people will tell me at a ccertain stage to STOP and it helps to know what others see.  I've learned to not give away the whole story narratively and compositionally and it's a great payoff. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're fine. I love hearing all the different takes on my work. Everything's about context I think. Yours is an interesting title and would give the piece some grounding to the narrative of this man's life. I chose "One"  because there is so little in the painting it leaves much to the viewer's imagination to fill in the gaps. The title I chose also is the same, so little but you gotta wonder, one? and it associates with what you see without directing too much into a specific storyline like "fishing" or something would. Just preference you know, no hard feelings hah </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just kind of made it up in my mind, wasn't any reference. I created a certain boat painting a while back and drew influence from that. Even that though was from something I witnessed and observed.  Cool relation though.

Hey guys, thanks for the interest. The original is $100, here's my website, www.artoframan.com . If you click  "Shop" it will take you to my original paintings so you can buy straight through paypal and I will package and ship them.   If  you'd like a print, the drop down menu under "shop" says "print shop" where a lot more of my work is available in many print options, frames, etc.    My original shop is two weeks old so I'm still uploading all my work on there. You can get more of a taste in "galleries".

Thanks and let me know if you need any help. - Raman  </TEXT>
