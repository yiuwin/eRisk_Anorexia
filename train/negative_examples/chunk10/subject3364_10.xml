And no guys, it isn't CGI or a robot . Just luck. Or misfortune depending on how you look at it.

Edit: Since this is getting pretty popular and some of may be curious about what this show actually is, I'll explain it here. The show is called Running Man, a Korean variety show. Basically it involves the cast and often guests competing to finish missions, usually set around Korean landmarks, for prizes. Guests have included Jackie Chan, Park Ji Sung and a lot of K-pop groups like Big Bang and 2NE1. I'll leave some of my favourite clips here so you can get a better idea of the show.

Personally, I loved it. A standout was the scene with the poison which was simultaneously exhilarating and heartbreaking. The story kept me on the edge of my seat, I never felt safe for any of my favourite characters. Shout out to [Mimura](#spoiler), he was the real MVP of this movie.
