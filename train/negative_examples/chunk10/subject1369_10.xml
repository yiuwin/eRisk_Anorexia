The WHO ICD is only updated every few decades. The current one (ICD-10) was issued in 1990. ICD-11 is due in 2018. It takes years of research and multiple committee decisions to approve the change. Every committee that has considered the change has approved the new definition.

So, no. Not end of story. Remember that thing I said about "an ounce of research?" It might be smart to try it next time, though I do enjoy embarrassing you.

	<TEXT> You're statement predicts something you cannot possibly know.

By your own logic, nothing is knowable. 

Also I'm sick of people throwing around the term "mental disorder." What is and isn't a mental disorder is [not a matter of opinion but fact](http://time.com/4424589/being-transgender-is-not-a-mental-disorder-study/). No one gets to decide someone is mentally ill because something they're completely ignorant about makes them uncomfortable. Take a minute to do an ounce of research.  

You're arguing like this subject is some nebulous hypothetical and not an issue impacting real people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When Lionel is eating with Troy and his other friends they yell out "gay" and "fag" in a derogatory manner. (Episode 2, 4:30) 


**BONUS:**

Later Lionel can't get his hair cut at the barber. 

In later episodes Lionel's editor calls him a girl. 

Lionel's shyness is partly due to his fear of being out in a culture that can be repressive.  </TEXT>

For me the were no lulls in The Wire. Every minute of every scene is packed with meaning, nothing is wasted. Every line of dialogue advances the plot. 

And then you have Breaking Bad episodes like The Fly and [scenes like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKa9J8bglSM).   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you bring up a good point. There is no great service that provides a quality rundown of all the sports highlights for that day. 

ESPN will show highlights but they are disjointed. Their site loads terribly and their video player seems to break every time I use it. So why go to a bad site to watch poorly produced highlight videos?   

There seems to be a huge gap in the market for highlights. The problem, of course, is that no startup would be able to pay the league licensing fees of the raw footage.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once a profit powerhouse, ESPN has become a business in crisis as it struggles to navigate the eroding pay-TV industry. Some conservative critics attribute this to a newly politicized network. Other conservatives say they recognize that ESPNs business problems are deeper  and that the political aspect to ESPN is merely an attempt to generate heat amid that decline. The gleeful reaction, some say, is mostly just schadenfreude. Either way, in the parlance of trolls abusing sportswriters Twitter mentions, conservatives say ESPN should stick to sports.


The article essentially ascribes the decline of ESPN to a list of issues:

1)  Spending billions of dollars a year on expensive sports rights.

2) Falling subscriber rates as people "cut the cord." 

3) Young people (main demographic) get highlights from social media.

4) Stats and scores are easier to find online. 

5) New digital competitors have grown. (PFT, Big Cat, Bleacher Report)

6) General corporate mismanagement.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  FOX News doesn't exist because of some evil scheme to promote conservative hegemony, it exists because they realized there was a market for right wing news and could make a ton of money. 

Eh, thats not exactly accurate. Ailes was desperate to have a conservative perspective on TV to help the GOP. Before becoming the founding CEO of Fox News he was a GOP operative. Before it launched only Murdoch and Ailes expected it to be profitable, but no one knew how successful it would become. 

I highly recommend Gabriel Sherman's **The Loudest Voice in the Room: How the Brilliant, Bombastic Roger Ailes Built Fox News--and Divided a Country**.  </TEXT>
