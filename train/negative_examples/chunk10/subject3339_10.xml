	<TEXT> 1.Aristarchuswas born in about 310 BC in Ancient Greece. He was the first person to propose that the earth and the other planets orbit the sun. He also said that the stars are much farther away than the planets.

2.Gregor Mendelwas a monk who founded the science of genetics. He was the first person to correctly identify the rules of heredity which determine how traits are passed through generations of living things.

3.but his hypothesis is gaining ground everyday even the national post did an article on his theory. I'm not saying it's 100% at the moment but I'll be watching more information

	<TEXT> Or hear me out it's the cost of building on a flood plain and never expecting that 1 in 100 year storm to actually show up even tho your insurance company tells you before you buy the fucking house it can't insure you for floods.

Same thing happened in Calgary and that one I believe was worse  </TEXT>

Close but still they over shoot by enough to to seem like the world will end in 9-15 years instead of 50-100 and given that co2 lvls from man are growing at a declining rate we still have to wait to see if that actually makes a change. I'm still waiting on the science to tell me x amount of co2 rises the temperature x amount of degrees </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. My prediction is just as valid as any other scientist who claims to know when we will hot the marker today alone I have seen 9 years away, 15 years and 2100s is what the governments have been told so I like my chances of being right better.

2. In the next 15 years our co2 lvls will drastically drop then methane will be the leading cause till we start eating lab grown meat then life will become cold for most of the planet.


I like the planet warming means it will get more tropical  so sit back and have a beer and soon a beach will appear
