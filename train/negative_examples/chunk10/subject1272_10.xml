	<TEXT> Anyone ever played classic Nexuiz? I remember the game having lots of servers filled with players and then the game started to die out after the new Nexuiz was being released with Xonotic at the same time. 

Did the playerbase split into three or did most of it move into the new one? The playerbase of the classic one just started to drop right after the release and Xonotic didn't even get nearly as much as players as the old one did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are three magazines in the office on the first floor. (First is on the red sofa, second is on the office desk and the third is on the ground between the first two.) 

All three have pictures of attacking soldiers. Assaulter, sniper, point man (guy with a shield), and assaulter. The first row on this list might be hinting the type of attacking operators that will come this year. Jackal is already here who pretty much fits the role of an assaulter, and a lot of people are speculating that the attacking operator for the second season will have a sniper. 

If this is correct, then we might know that the attacking operator for season three will have a shield.

The other picture with the man and a house could be what the next seasons operator will look like, and the house might be a haunted house for the theme park map. (I checked the buildings in Bartlett map and they don't look like the picture in the magazine.) 

I haven't figured out yet how to transfer pictures from the PS4, [so sorry for this potato.](http://i.imgur.com/iNNTEFi.jpg)

	<TEXT> If cops want to bust drunk drivers than they should bust people who are driving drunk. Drunk drivers are extremely easy to spot and you don't need a checkpoint to spot them.

A few years ago I was driving normally behind a car and then there was a line to a checkpoint. The car in front of me was checked and they signaled the car to go to the side. The cops started to walk away to the car in the side. I just drive slowly and confused and decided to ask if they were going to check me. The cop was only talking to the radio and said " The driver has 1.4 promilles" and then looked at me and waved at me to "move along."

I wouldn't have known that the driver in front of me was drunk, if it weren't for the checkpoint or if the person would've crashed somewhere. In that case it would've been "easy to spot" and it would be too late for someone at that point... </TEXT>
