	<TEXT> My best friend from 1st to 8th grade.... we went to the same high school and our freshmen year, like 2 months in, she was sitting in the hallway and I went up to her and I said hi. She completely ignored me. I said "Kelly? Are you ok?". Ignored me. I kept asking questions and she didn't even look up at me. I just walked away super confused and sad. I never did her wrong or gave any reason for her to just completely disregard me. She was always a bitch tho and I ended up  making great new friends.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I drink alcohol (or sometimes when I eat too much), I make this weird noise that feels like it comes out of my chest. It's not a burp, though people think it is. It's like a gurgling that comes out of my throat and it's really loud and completely uncontrollable. It happens multiple times a minute. For like 20 minutes. I absolutely hate it and if I know I'm gonna be somewhere that will be quiet at some point, I can't drink in fear of this noise. It's hard to explain. 

Edit: a word and sentence  </TEXT>
