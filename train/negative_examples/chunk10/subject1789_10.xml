	<TEXT> Here's some. Would link but on mobile. 

Dreamscape - About 3k followers by now (I think), and they release almost anything as long as it's high quality. If you just look up dreamscape on sound cloud it should come up. 

Silver Skies Records - Pretty sure around 2k followers by now. Same as Dreamscape, release quality music regardless of genre. Look up on SC. 

Outertone - Not really small, but they release happy melodic stuff. Look up on SC. 

Sorry for no links again, will get some when I get on PC.  </TEXT>
