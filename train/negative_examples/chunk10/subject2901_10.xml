	<TEXT> Hello /r/diepio! I'm /u/subject2901.

I'm not popular at all on this subreddit but I feel as if I still have some good feedback here.

I created this Reddit account 11 months ago solely to make suggestions in the old "AutoMod's Suggestions Thread". I actually did that a lot but they obviously went unnoticed.

But why do I say this? Well, it's kind of obvious, but my username is literally Diep.io spelled backwards, except the period is an underscore and Reddit doesn't allow that.

My username stuck like this because I did not have any idea how to use Reddit and I didn't know I couldn't change my username. So, /r/diepio being the priority, I chose the name.

Just wanted to say that, I feel kind of unique </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any two points on the Earth have the same pressure and temperature, ALWAYS.

EDIT: Imagine two opposite points on the Earth, now imagine that the two points travel along a circle around the Earth. They must have swapped temperatures as they travel to each other's places, so imagine the graph that graphs the temperature. The intersection is the same temperature point. Now make another ring out of an infinite amount of those points, and pick two opposite points again. Again, going around 180 degrees, the air pressure must have swapped.

This is chanced and proven, always. https://youtu.be/csInNn6pfT4?t=10m55s </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello guys, I was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/6as9yy/eve_lander/) and thought I would make my own Eve one-rocket return.

Now, I've done my searches and approximations, but I am still not sure. Has there been any changes to the game since 1.0.5 (when I played a lot) and how much delta-v is necessary for Eve?

Or, any tips? </TEXT>
