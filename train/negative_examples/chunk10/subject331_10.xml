	<TEXT> Not sure why'd you say that, we don't exactly have a policy of locking threads as you can see from [this](http://i.imgur.com/tiOUiNN.jpg). The log doesn't go further back in time. Most of it's just AMA crossposts being locked to avoid user confusion. The rest of the non AMA threads were also removed I think for violating some rule, so it wasn't just a lock by itself. 

Generally the mod team doesn't agree on locking threads just because the comments section might be inflammatory. There are plenty of such threads in /r/television that remain unlocked. My personal view is that OP isn't responsible for the comments section so locking (or removing) the thread for something beyond his control isn't fair. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To explain the situation to some users who were writing comments, the thread was briefly locked for about 5 minutes. It was unlocked by me since the action was taken without consulting other mods. A quick follow-up discussion among online mods was in favor of leaving the thread unlocked. I will leave this comment up for about a half-hour since it won't be relevant for much longer beyond that point.

	<TITLE> Mod Announcement on the Leaked Episodes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-29 18:19:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone, the leaking of episodes (apparently 10 of 13 episodes) complicates things for us as mods. So we ask of you and remind you of the following:

* Do not ask for or link to streams/torrents/etc. - **no piracy**.

* **Do not post spoilers from the episodes anywhere in the subreddit** unless it's abundantly clear the thread is about leaked season 5 spoilers. That means if you want to discuss the leaked episodes in their own special threads, that's okay to do, but discussing them elsewhere where non-piraters may be is strictly prohibited. Even if you use the spoiler tag format as described in the sidebar.

* Since the episodes have unfinished effects, ADR, etc., there will be no official discussion threads made to discuss the leaked content since the leaked episodes are not representative of the official OITNB episodes we can eventually expect to see. </TEXT>
