	<TITLE> A local earthquake station gets an anonymous tip... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-01 00:31:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 
One day a local scientist named Steve was sent a mysterious email. The email read:

Steve I know who you are, and where you live. My name must remain anonymous, so as of now you may refer to me as "Somebody". Steve I contact you because my independent studies have discovered a massive earthquake heading your way. You, your research center, your city, and half of your State are in for the mother of all earthquakes. My advanced Richter scale is reading an earthquake with a magnitude of 13! That's an extremely dangerous magnitude as you should know, your state will literally vibrate, do the wave, roll itself out, in other words you will die if you don't act now. You have exactly 25 hours to evacuate everyone and take any important instruments or research devices that cannot be lost or replaced, to safety. By my calculations you'll pick up the oncoming earthquake in 4 hours, but if every city and town doesn't start evacuating in 8 hours, it may be too late to save everyone.

Steve panicked, he didn't want to risk anything so he packed all of his important instruments first into a van and pulled out his laptop. He needed to make sure that this was a confirmed earthquake and not some hoax. So he did, he waited the four hours and sure enough it was real. He quickly speed dialed the mayor, who had always been a good friend of his.

"Steve, you caught me at a rough time what do you need?"

"Mayor you need to evacuate half of the state, we're all in danger!"

"Woah! Woah! Steve, are you okay? What's going on?"

"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me". </TEXT>
