	<TEXT> When you use the"let off accelerator brakes" does it light up the brake lights? Or not. 

Is autopilot smooth enough to simply ease to a stop without lighting up?

My question stems from following a model S in traffic this morning. As the freeway slowed down into a jam and throughout the jam, the brake lights came on so infrequently that it was difficult to gauge if they were slowing down or not. It seems that they only lit up when the vehicle was a complete rest, which also seemed relatively infrequent (which leads to my autopilot assumption) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For me it works like this. Space is a typically described in three dimensions. X, y, and z axis, but really time is also. Think about it this way. To create a collision between two objects, they need to occupy the same coordinates at the same time. Of course, you know that. And of course for a collision to actually occur, the two objects need to occupy the same coordinates at the *same time*. This means that it's also a coordinate that can be plotted. You know this intuitively - whenever you talk about occupying space in a specific place, you are also referring to when it's being occupied. 

Once you have that processed, let's talk about relative time. 

To put it simply, we seemingly experience time as a *constant* it doesnt speed up or slow down, we are simply traveling at a given rate.

Let's put that back in our coordinate system, as a graph. We had 4 coordinates, x, y, z and t. Let's for simplicity, consider only two dimensions. X and Y. Where x is time and Y is forward and backward in space. (an object moving in one direction/vector). 

Let's say the object is perfectly still, it is still moving, it is moving through time, at the constant speed of time. Or one minute per minute. In our graph, this would be represented by the object moving straight across the graph with no turns, moving at a constant speed. 

Now, the object gets moved, someone pushes it, so on our graph, it is now moving diagonally. It's still moving through time, but it's also moving through space. Of the constant movement of the object through the graph is at a *consistent speed*, then it moves to the side (through time) more slowly. 

For example if every unit in the Y axis is 1 meter, and every unit in X axis is 1 second, when you move an object 1 meter per second, then the line will be moving in a 45 degree angle, and must*travel farther to complete one unit (second) in the x axis*. 

But we already established out can't move faster, it's constant, which means, for the object, in one second, it is now moved through time (x axis) slightly less than one complete unit (or second). Time has slowed down for it. 


Now, moving to light, light speed is what happens when the speed is so great, the angle through the x axis is 90 degrees (the slope is vertical. Ie, staying still has a horizontal line which the slope is infinity: 1 aka 0, at 1 meter per second, the slope is 1:1, or 45 degrees, 100 meters per second is 1:100, or very steep but not vertical, light is vertical, completely, that's how fast the constant in the universe moves)

That means, for light, moving that fast means that where ever it goes, time has not moved, and therefore, from its perspective there is no time. 

In other words, there is a constant speed to everything, no more no less. The more you move in one dimension, the less you move in the other. If you are still, all the speed is dedicated to the time dimension, if you are light, all the speed is dedicated in the x (or y or z) dimension. Any speed in between is dispersed among the various dimensions, but always add up to the same total speed. But we move too slowly on earth to notice it.  </TEXT>

The GOP needs to fully confront the message they have been sending for years, and make a decision whether or not they will eject their deplorables.  The Democrats kicked them out in 64, and willingly took out their electoral chances for a generation, I hope that the GOP will have the courage to do the same.

	<TEXT> People don't realize, as much as corporations push for lower taxes and less regulations, the biggest risk to business is volatility and instability. 

Meaning, even if, and big if there, they actually believed that trump would get the laws they wanted, it still would be bad for business, and worse than any negative regulations. 

The stock market would tank and investment will dry up, simply because he is so unpredictable, and no one wants to risk it. 

Even if they don't like Hillary, at least they can predict and plan for whatever it is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am finishing my masters in architecture at the moment, and prepping my thesis on American building home standards. 

In short, drywall is good enough. Why spend more on masonry or concrete when you can get more than good enough with drywall. And the difference isn't small. You're talking a good 20-30% price increase of the total house (especially with the added weight of these walls on the structure, causing an increase in that realm.)

Drywall is also easier to work with, saving on transportation costs, labor costs and more. It's less material and energy intensive to produce (cement production is one of the largest contributers to greenhouse gasses, drywall and cement board uses far less)

It's also cheaper and easier to maintain and repair.

Also, it takes less room, meaning that the square footage dedicated to space dividers goes down, adding a good 3-7% usable space in a standard building envelope. 

Lastly, it makes for a more flexible interior that can be easily changed. This means that the house itself can last longer, because you won't need to demolish the whole thing to move a couple of rooms around as living situations and standards change. 

In general many people rag on the quality of American building materials, but it's simply the technology advances are stunning over the last 30 years. For example, the cheapest sealants and glues today have more than double lifespan of the best ones just 30-40 years ago. Architects are still building to the 100 year standard (and has almost always done), it's just never been easier or cheaper to achieve that. Properly maintained, your crap McMansion will last as long, or longer, and be more cost effective than anything you or I could build with brick or concrete.
