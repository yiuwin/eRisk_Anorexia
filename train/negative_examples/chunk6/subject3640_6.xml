	<TEXT> Hey, I don't know how many of these requests get filled so maybe if you want, I have Kung Fu Panda 3, but at 720p and its approx 750 mbs (and... I know its probably not the best for showing in front of friends or something but its watchable if you're alone, again not sure how many of the requests get filled)...and its on Dropbox. Now I could transfer it over to Mega but its going to have to be overnight so you're going to have to wait about 12 hours. But anyways here's the Dropbox link if you really want it immediately
