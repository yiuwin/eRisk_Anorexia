	<TEXT> I'm mainly an FPS player so I was looking to play the offense classes, but I found myself playing Lucio, Zenyatta and Symmetra quite a bit and had lots of fun. Just stay behind and support the team by healing, orbs etc. and don't get to close. Sure you'll get flanked every now and then, but usually you'll stay alive, especially as Lucio. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yogg isn't even competitively viable so who cares? It won't make tournaments or something, and usually if you face against it, the person playing that deck loses anyway.

The shaman card is perfect for mid-range and isn't that powerful since it's usually played late in the game when it's easy to remove. 

Stop whining, this expansion has been fucking great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Liquid told him he could play whatever role he wanted, then they picked up Koosta who can't rifle so S1mple had to.

Kid was just homesick, he wanted to see his family, friends and gf. He lived all alone in LA, while his teammates were home and they could visit their friends/family all they want.

Then Liquid promised a bootcamp which never came either.

It sucks for s1mple as well, but there's two sides to every story. We'll just have to wait for Liquid's statement or what the players say down the line.

I love s1mple as a player, but there's no doubt he has a very strong personality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to Hiko, Liquid is trying to get him into a European team most likely without a big buyout.

However, the only team I feel like he would maybe fit in is Faze. Na'Vi is the 2nd best team in the world, so for them to do a roster change now would be idiotic.

He left F3 with bad blood between him and the players, Oskar from HR definitely doesn't want him either. Gambit could be an option, but I'm not sure how those players feel about s1mple either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That isn't really true. It was more him being like: "what the fuck he just running shot me" (just an example of what someone would say) instead of being calm and calling where the enemy is.

And also true what Tonyxis says below. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I couldn't find a better pic either.

Also, at the part where it goes to map 2 in the Luminosity vs Navi game it says "Map 2 Mirage" even though it's Inferno. 

Just pointing out a small mistake, great fragmovie nonetheless! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great video although it's a bit long. Watched all of it though since I'm definitely going to buy Overwatch and I haven't seen all that much of the game.

Also, it's great to see you and AZK get into this game and staying relevant in competitive gaming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was a big part of why he was kicked. They also didn't give adreN a chance to prove himself with a different role, they put Hiko/Nitr0 on the IGL role after he was kicked, which was a mistake imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nitr0 played like a mad man. It seemed like Liquid just overextended way too much, especially s1mple (probably due to tilting). I mean hell, the guy has insane talent, but he needs to learn to stop overextending and to play smart. Also to just calm down. 

Koosta played like dogshit on T-side because he can't do shit with a rifle, s1mple was pretty quiet with it too so I don't see why they didnt just let Koosta have it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. They have 3 aggresive players, a lurk and koosta as support I guess? They just need a rock, a rifler who can keep sites on lockdown until teammates rotate. Like Krimz, xyp9x etc. Sadly there aren't a lot of good support players in America, and one of the best ones is banned, AZK. </TEXT>
