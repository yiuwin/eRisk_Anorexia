	<TEXT> Theres nothing noob about this questions. There were times when I had the same questions but noone to ask. So had to figure it out myself. In this case the first was put the sunset. So the reds and yellows. In the sky and i put few brush strokes on spots where forest would later appear. During the same wash i made some marks on snow shade. Then came the cabin and then the forest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it is not, there are so many great watercolor artist that do far better stuff than I will ever do. Really. And dont take this that way that I am saying this to hear more ego stroking things, but because of the credit that I believe deserve people like Zbukvic, Castagnet, Tanabe, Jasiewicz, Gorean and many more </TEXT>
