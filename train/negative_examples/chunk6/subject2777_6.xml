	<TEXT> Looks like Ancestral Vision is out--this is the single card I was hoping for the most :/

It would be sick if 217-220 were exactly Ensnaring Bridge, Chalice of the Void, Crucible of Worlds and Engineered Explosives.  Of those I'm hoping for Chalice the most.

Please Aether Vial at 215 and Cavern of Souls at 232.

	<TEXT> Hi guys, I recently took this deck to play with my three friends

*4 Stormcrow

*4 Siege Rhino

*4 Splinter Twin

*4 Damnation

*4 Living Wish

*4 Burning Wish

*4 Glittering Wish

*4 Death Wish

*4 Golden Wish

*24 assorted lands

The idea of this deck is that you play all the best cards plus a bunch of wishes in order to get more copies (since I can only have 4 in my maindeck but as many as I want in my binder).

**Round 1 vs Nelly with Elves (homebrew!)**

She got me low by flooding the board and attacking, but I stabilized with Damnation. Then I played some Stormcrows which all her 1/1s couldn't block or attack into, and I eventually pecked away for the win.

**Round 2 vs Gery with Lantern Control (filthy netdeck)**

He got out Ensnaring Bridge and emptied his hand really quick. I was able to land a Rhino and equip it with Twin, but he stopped my combo with Pithing Needle. I had to use Glittering, Living and Death Wish to get more Rhinos from my binder. I ended the game with eight Rhinos in play, just like I drew it up.

**Round 3**

I was supposed to play my last friend Chris but their mother came to pick them up. So I played a literal mirror match with a mirror. The reflection only played out a creature or spell when I did and so the board was completely stalled and there was never a good chance to Damnation. I eventually decked out.

**Conclusion**

The deck performed above expectations and I would recommend to anyone who needs to put their friend, girlfriend or little brother in their place.
