And a week later I was fine but something set me.off and ranted to her. She said she felt bad about the break up. I know she won't "eventually fall into my arms again" like everyone keeps saying. She wants to be friends and I don't want to chase her away. I'm lost and she doesn't seem to feel as bad As I do.  </TEXT>
