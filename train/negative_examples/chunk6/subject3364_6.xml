	<TEXT> Yeah. That's what I'm worried about. I don't want his price to increase if people realise the potential he has in the EPL. I'm loving his card so far and if his price increases with the TOTW and goes out of my budget I'll be really annoyed. </TEXT>

3. Your Name - Radwimps (Zenzenzense, Nandemonaiya)

There are obviously many more soundtracks that I have enjoyed but these four are the most memorable ones. Hans Zimmer is a genius. I cannot wait for his next score. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just finished it. I've been kind of off anime for a while due to an obsession with a korean show called 'Running Man'. Check it out if you're interested, its hilarious. Anyway, I returned to anime with Kimi no na Wa which was good. Really good. But after finishing TGWLTT, I personally think its better. I've only watched a few anime movies. 5 centimeters per second (a bit disappointing), Summer Wars (good), Kimi no na Wa (great), Castle in the Sky (decent) and a few others that were not memorable. TGWLTT is definitely my favorite  out of those movies.


 The main characters in it are all good. Especially Chiaki who I didn't think would have so much depth to his character. The side characters are a bit forgettable. Except Takase. He went insane and then just left which was a bit disappointing since his situation was kind of interesting.The main girl's (Makoto) friend is kind of just there and doesn't really do much, though she did do one really awesome thing near the end which signified the relationship the two girls had. If you've seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about. I would put spoiler tags but I have no idea how to. Someone please help me.

Anyway, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time was a brilliant movie. I put it off for a while due to prior commitments with Korean variety but I am so glad I gave it a try. If you haven't seen it yet, please give it a go as well. </TEXT>
