	<TEXT> I don't like Opie   Anthony eather, that being said..that dudes story was soooo fake and weird.

I'm surprised they didn't call him out even more, who the fuck would ask there friend "hey dude will you tape me fucking"?

Yea right! , This guys  "friend" is going to hide in a closet for hours just to film his boys dick?

It actuality sounds like a weirdly homoerotic fantasy, He wishes he had the tape?....really?

The devil is in the details, it plays out more like a closeted homosexual fantasy then it does as a funny story.

	<TEXT> I don't know, Bikers are notoriously a rough bunch, I'm not sure what they do to earn those patches, but i'm sure it's not pretty.

When i was in Arizona i camped out with a biker gang, They are very VERY scary people, If you want to test your luck go right ahead.

They indeed will fuck you up for wearing there stuff, a percentage of them are ex military and have ptsd.  

gemininature i agree with you in some respects,however,real biker gangs are nothing to fuck with!

TLTR Bikers are not rational people. </TEXT>

I think some music sounds better to other creators than it does to those who just listen.

	<TEXT> During my wedding, as we where walking down the isle, the DJ's laptop crashed.....

He comes storming out yelling "Don't worry I'm not going to screw this up, i have a backup!" (everybody laughed)

The point is, that made our wedding so much better and memorable, If i where her i would have been laughing my ass off, the lighter side is they have a hilarious story to tell for all time.

I doubt  she was amused though, too bad, in another light this could have been the highlight of her wedding.

This is just too funny!

So far i only record with a Microkorg and Audacity and there all real time experiments.... so yes there out of time and just don't hold up as reliable source material.

In the future i will be working with a different programs, so who knows what tomorrow will bring.

	<TEXT> I agree It's not like white people need a prefix you're just white, not Irish American or Italian American etc.

Not all black people come from Africa....Let's say you're black and you were born in the UK are you British-American?

To be black and American it's as if the onus is on you to trace your family lineage back to your earliest ancestors.

That may be interesting to some, however, does the majority of white Americans need to do the same?

Black people were enslaved to build this country from very early on, there more American than most immigrants, they earned the right and then some to call themselves AMERICAN! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a real thing when i was younger i traveled the country and i met many Rainbow people.

They set up events called rainbow gatherings they were cool, hundreds of rainbow kids would come and they had multiple camp sites.

Each camp, for the most part, had a specialty one might have coffee the other may have a pizza kitchen and so on.

Money was not generally allowed what is preferred is a barter system.

They even had rainbow guides that alerted you of the next gathering as well as names and addresses of other rainbow people across the USA so if you needed a place to stay or needed food you could basically just show up at there door and be taken care of.

	<TEXT> Certainly not, when I first heard Tycho I thought it was an excellent idea!

If i were going to make a guess you and Tycho are heavily inspired by Helious another great project.

That being said i think the pitfalls of Tycho and Middaystatic are the predictable nature of the compositions....The listener knows what's going to happen.

Middaystatic has definitely learned the ingredients, however, fails to make a better cake.

Perhaps it may be better for Middaystatic to choose the road less traveled and surprise us like i know you can.

You're talented! Smoke some pot and see what else you can come up with i'm eager too hear.  :  )

Things wrong here :

* I have always been taught to never climb a dead tree...unless it is thoroughly inspected EG~ root integrity,holding wood,cracks,stress fractures, pest intrusion  etc 

* Escape route

* The groundsman was pulling way too hard. 

When you hear an electric chainsaw with any kind of climbing (warning bells are ringing)

I can go on, there are so many things wrong here to list them all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I spent some time living on the streets when i was a young man and i heard so many similar stories(and the one he is telling is common)

My take on hearing these story's are that they are fabricated. Not too say that it doesn't happen, but for the most part they are disingenuous.


Let me explain why, We as human beings need an essential ingredient in life, and that is to have control.

Without having control of your life we feel helpless, that's why i think these story's of hardship come in to play as a way to place the Onus on these extraneous circumstances rather then on themselves.... therefor selling the idea that they had very little to do with there downfall.

I feel it in a way soothes them, In telling these story's i think they feel empowered by controlling the perception that most have on them (worthless)....I believe it is a way of humanizing there behavior so we can understand there pain and suffering without judgment...or harsh judgment, it eases away from the guilt.

I do not see this as a negative sort of thing rather an insight into the physiological nature of us all.

I am sure we have all fabricated a story to save face...imagine what it is like for them.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think i can offer the same good advice as was given to me on the track i made.

I think like myself our work sounds a but predictable.

I myself need to elongate the base track to more than 4 bars and fade and mix in different layers to engage the listener.

Edit- I checked out planets (your other work) and heard some tunes i really liked, I really hope you keep on developing your ideas.

I'd like to collaborate if your interested.   
That said i did like how the track eventually developed (nice touches at the end)

Keep it up I'd like to here more    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is great advice, i agree the song is very predictable, I do need to lengthen my melody's to make it sound more interesting.

Everything you said was spot on...currently I'm learning Audasity, This is the first in many years i am falling in love with a program that fits my needs.

I have an interesting philosophy when it comes to creating and recording music.........Everything besides the drum track is done in real time.

I've never been a fan of step recording although i do love the results.

I guess i like the organic nature of this method, every one of my songs (if you can call them that) are completely different.

I also find it challenging to play in time for an entire track i hope this will improve my playing over all.

So yea i really appreciate your advice it means allot to me.

PS does anybody have a beat i can use?        </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello all you music makers out there, I am a mod over at /r/SoundsLikeBoC a sub dedicated to music that sounds like Boards Of Canada.

I've had it on my mind that not only did i want to create a sub where like minded people can listen and discover new music,....
but also a space where fellow musicians can come together/
collaborate on music projects.

[Here is something](https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundsLikeBoC/comments/4x20u9/i_have_an_idea_for_a_community_music/) I came up with as our first collaborative music project.

Take some time too check it out and tell me what you think.

My hopes for the future is that SoundsLikeBoC will be a sub not limited too just music discovery, that it will be a platform where fans of BoC can work together and make music of our own.
