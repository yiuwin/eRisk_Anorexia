These will take you on a mind blowing journey but in a nutshell some people think mankind has been as smart as we are for 7000 generations but we keep getting fucked up by events that bring us to the brink of Extinction. The last big one being somewhere around 12000 years ago when we were brought out of an ice age by  something melting the glacier super fast like a meteor impact. 

Suffice to say we are the most technologically advanced we have ever been and us preserving it may help us return to that level faster in the case disaster strikes again.

Take the videos with a grain of salt and do your own research folks . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> America is broken half your people are on welfare and that creates a the majority of your crime, prison and health problems in Canada are welfare state is at about 10% why you might ask? well we make people on ei go out and search for work and if they don't we kick them off. If you legal can't wait because of health problems you get put on a government program where you get paid barely enough to survive. 

Your country needs someone to take a lead and make the hard choices, educate the public about what this means for them and they will follow or go ballistic cause that's what Americans seem to do. 

If you make over 250000 a year in Canada you pay a 33% tax someone like Bernie only paying 14% needs to change in order to fix your country

	<TEXT> We all know a douche who thinks he is God's gift to women and goes ballistic when he gets rejected.

we all know that crazy bitch who after couple drinks think she's Ten Feet Tall and will chop your nuts off with a knife cause becky with the good hair be looking at you.

Humans are a mixed bagged but creating a stigma around certain people is just begging for trouble.

Edit: my point is everyone is equal but the narrative nowadays is to shame and berate men and its going to have negative consequences

	<TEXT> I thought it would be fun to do the math 

Each person exhales 2.3 pounds of carbon dioxide a day 

839 pounds a year 

So at Alberta's current carbon price the government would make half a billion a year on just us breathing.

At the 2050 price it would be 8.75 billion  </TEXT>

Killing jobs to virtue signal to the youth who don't even fucking vote. taxes that don't have a clear purpose for use and most people are just sitting at home watching Netflix not giving a single fuck.
