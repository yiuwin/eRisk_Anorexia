IMO, Spidey should be one of those characters where you can always find a classic red and blue version of.

EDIT: I'm glad it did take them a while though, I'm not a fan of those older bodies, and Pizza Spidey arrived just when Hasbro started going above and beyond with the accessory count on these figures. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd rather have him in another MCU film to be honest. The MI franchise doesn't really need another fit guy to help Tom Cruise. 

I know the same can be said about Hawkeye not being needed, but I like the idea of him showing up in Ant-Man and The Wasp. </TEXT>

Did a double take when I saw it.

EDIT: Got one a few hours ago. Colossus was one of the ones I was planning on waiting for, but seeing the prices it's been going for lately, made me reconsider. Didn't wanna miss out. </TEXT>

I do agree with his Nomad complaints. I absolutely hate that thing, and I hope it's done away with for ME:A2. </TEXT>
