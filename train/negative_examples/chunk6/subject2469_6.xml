I guess it's the size of it that you are pointing out ... my problem is rather that the trend often picture big eyes and innocent characters, which reminds me of baby kids...and I find it a bit disturbing to see kids with such a thing...but then again they always say it's a 16+, 18+ character :/ ... sometimes though, it's really outrageous how they picture teenage girls. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it depends on what your expectations are...is your number of views satisfying to you? when starting off, I think uploading as often as possible is a good thing...But you shouldn't put your expectations too high, because it is relatively a very hard thing to grow a channel, the most important is to enjoy what you are doing. When you have fun doing something, whatever else doesn't matter and you can be more patient while waiting for luck to turn your way. I've been doing this for almost 2 years now, I have made over 150 videos and always trying things out (paid advertisements, social medias, ...) ... but nothing has been very fruitful up until now ... however, I enjoy doing so much that really nothing else matter and I keep making new videos for my few real followers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just leave it, go spend time with your family and friends if you are longing for that. It's useless to keep doing something when you feel the costs are too high for so little benefits. Just do what you enjoy doing and if "making youtube video" is no longer enjoyable for you, then find something else. Still, I don't think your situation is that bad, I mean, I'd love to have 3-7 subs daily and 100-200 organic views per video. Your problem is the retention rate, when you feel like doing it, try to find how to increase it...maybe your videos are too long or not engaging enough. </TEXT>

In order for it to be a career, it has to be a viable business, therefore you should study what a viable business is and consider it as such from the beginning. It might still not work and backfire later on, but you need to have the necessary strength to accept your mistakes and keep working hard. Even with all the effort you make it can still not succeed, but that's what risk is and "who risks nothing gets nothing" .... On the other hand, you could just relax, post one or two videos here and there from time to time, and bet on their quality, i.e. gamble on getting a miracle hit....but that's not an effective way of making a career.  </TEXT>
