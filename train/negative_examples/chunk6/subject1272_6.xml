	<TEXT> That's pretty much how ISIS was getting reinforcements at the beginning of the conflict (though other groups did this also). IIRC they had some video footage of blowing up prison walls/gates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They obviously don't have any resemblance to each other, but I noticed that the Vacuum B.O.B's [1](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marathongame/images/d/d9/Vacuum-BoB.gif/revision/latest?cb=20100908185423), [2](http://marathon.bungie.org/story/_images/Pfhor_VacBob.jpg) look very similar to the early concept of [Master Chief.](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/halo/images/d/d4/Halo_original_4.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070225063222)

You're right though, the security officer/cyborg doesn't look like that pog at all. There might be some artwork that looks similar to the pog [1](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marathongame/images/f/f9/MRno54.gif/revision/latest?cb=20100924081215), [2](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5362/345504-rage3.jpg), but there's a whole bunch of artwork with the cyborg looking slightly different in each picture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Alternatehistoryhub](https://www.youtube.com/alternatehistoryhub) has a lot of good videos on historical events and the outcomes if they would be played a bit differently. It might be a bit inaccurate, but I binge watched all of the videos straight away.

Some are less serious like if movie scenarios are turned into reality while others are more serious and long like "What if Germany won WWII?"

[Example video.](https://youtu.be/VEmr36AJm54)

[Knowledgehub](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2_KC8lshtCyiLApy27raYw) used to be called Geographyhub. But now has started to make more videos on different topics. Still many good videos of geography and flags.

[Example video.](https://youtu.be/kjiIC2TWWG8) 

They're both done by the same guy and he adds a little humor to them. There are also contest videos sometimes where you can write your own alternate history scenario/story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not the weirdest, but its the most frustrating unsolved crime that I saw it on TV was about some man in Florida who went missing on a fishing trip. The end of the episode pointed out that most of the evidence was pointing towards the wife who wanted to end the searches and now lives with the husbands best friend. The wife also threatened the husbands mother that she would never see her granddaughter if she hired a private investigator. The whole thing was so fishy with every clue pointing towards the wife and it was so frustrating that it ended unsolved with the mother still waving a "have you seen me?" Sign after many years.

Edit: Thanks for the help of telling the name, [I also found the episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG8EHa0SBBM) Watch it if you want to get pissed off. </TEXT>
