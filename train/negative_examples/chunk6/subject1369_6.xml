	<TEXT> A non-exclusive franchise player may negotiate with other NFL teams, but if the player signs an offer sheet from another team, the original team has a right to match the terms of that offer, or if it does not match the offer and thus loses the player, is entitled to receive two first-round draft picks as compensation.

	<TEXT> The optics grow worse, too, when Cousins shows up in person in Atlanta for the NFC championship game and says on social media that hes taking notes on Aaron Rodgers and Matt Ryan, two of the best in the world do what they do. A 3-year-old could connect the following dots with a fat burgundy crayon. Ryan is coached by Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan. Shanahan is two things: Cousinss first pro offensive coordinator, back in his days with Washington, and the apparent next coach of the San Francisco 49ers. Cousins is guaranteed to play in Washington just one more season, and wouldnt Shanahan just love to take a guy with whom he already has worked to the Bay?

Hillary won both the primary and general by around 3 million votes, America chose her.

	<TEXT> That post was clearly designed to confuse the reader. This is what people are talking about when they say conservatives are gas-lighting the country. 

This was posted to a right-wing Facebook page with the ultimate goal of removing any regulatory obstacles to making a lot of money destroying the environment. 

It's shameful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I looked it up. Filing fees in the three states total about $2.2 million. 

Wisconsin's fee is just $1.1 million. 

Stein's originally estimated attorney costs at $1 million but as money poured in the number was raised to $2-3 million.

	<TEXT> That is not entirely accurate. The Clinton camp is not supporting the recount but participating. [NPR had the same confusion.](https://twitter.com/npr/status/802616084646002688) 

The distinction is important. Clinton's campaign is participating in the recount to ensure nothing gets out of hand. Essentially they're saying they will be in the 'room' because without them it would just be Stein.  </TEXT>
