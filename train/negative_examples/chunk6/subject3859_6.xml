	<TEXT> Haha I wasn't really going to. and thank you, it's not tooooo hard but can be a struggle to develop the piece to a certain level. It's in oils and is on a wooden panel. I started by doing a single colored underpainting, which means I throw one color on there, light blue  in this case and spread it all around the panel. When its even, I will draw out the face and city, etc, with a brush using the same blue. That layer is in gamsol(paint thinner).   that's the first layer and usually the hardest for me to get the face accurate. IT's basically a struggle at the beginning to get all the proportions and stuff in the right place. After the drawing layer is done. I let it dry.

about a day later, I can start adding color layers using linseed oil and letting them dry a bit between each one. IF the drawing is in place, the rest is just fun. you can experiment with textures, values, and choosing what to really emphasize in the painting.  I built everything up to a certain level in about 2-3 layers and then only focused on the face. as you can see it's more developed. eespecially the eyes. Just spen tthe rest of the time on that.    The level of technical finish usually is strongest at the focal point and gets looser as it things move away from the it.  

whoops didn't even mean to write that much.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah I have been asked that quite a lot. I wish I had made it to sell but I made it for myself to build my portfolio. I am working around the theme of sikhism/punjab. I can make you something else though, just can't sell this particular piece. If you're interested in a painting, p.m me.   You can buy a print here and check out the rest of my work. Thank you

It was a just a gimmick to make it feel more recent or fresh. 

If I saw "I painted this last year" or "I just finished this painting"

what's more exciting?
I know it was wrong but honestly don't feel so bad about it.
I had no ill intentions behind it so forgive me.  </TEXT>

Sometimes I say I "just finished" it. Why is that a big deal?  IT's my painting. So what if I finished it a year ago?   does it matter?

Seems like you found out that you were wrong about accusing me and now just want to find something to pick at. 

Why are you so worried about it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thank you and yes! I started out using just the knife and then slowly figured out a way to be efficient with it. Since the palette knife takes a lot of paint, I started building the initial layers with a brush and as the layers thicken I was able to use the knife. It moved around much easier and the paint had better reaction to the surface because of the strong underlying foundations.    

The landscapes are smaller, usually 8x10 canvases and for those I sometimes skipped building with a brush since I didn't need too much paint. </TEXT>
