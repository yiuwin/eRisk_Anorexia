	<TEXT> How do the precepts help to cultivate conditions of "clarity of mind"?
  They prevent  having disturbing thoughts that take me away from now. Goodness gives peace.

Also, How does using lemon pledge to wipe down a counter cultivate conditions of "Clarity of mind"? How is cleaning your home connected to the purpose of the precepts?

I know I kill creatures that way. Maybe little tiny ones, but I do.  That is a disturbing thought </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are not right choices. Also, there is single person suffering and married person suffering, so It is not something you run away from.

 You need to be at esay with your self and don't decide out of anger, fear nor delusion. Just let It be and rest, It will get clear soon. Hope It helps. </TEXT>
