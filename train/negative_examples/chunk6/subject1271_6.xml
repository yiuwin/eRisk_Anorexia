	<TEXT> Yes. I think it might make it even better tbh. Is that even the main mystery of the show? not in my opinion.  </TEXT>

Erlich: "Hey, you notice how we never get any pussy? "

Richard: "Yea, because there are hardly any girls around here"

	<TEXT>  How this isn't the no. 1 comedy on TV right now is completely beyond me.

diversity issues. it's a very white male dominated series and doesn't caters to a female audience. It's a true representation of the tech industry and Silicon Valley (the place) itself. My problem is tho the shows has never ever taken the time out to address this issue not in the slightless.

You thinking this show could be the no. 1 comedy on TV despite lacking diversity is very naive of you.

	<TEXT> no only live numbers. Unless HBO Go has gotten a maasive uptick in subscribers I'd like to think the amount of users on HBO Go is still pretty much the same as it was last year. Even less now that Game of Thrones isn't airing </TEXT>
