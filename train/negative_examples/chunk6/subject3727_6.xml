	<TEXT> [Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir) whenever you listen or talk about India you should talk about Kashmir. In 1947 Indian government occupied Kashmir Illegally. You can do your own research about it but the main thing is that Indian army has murdered more than 100000 man, woman and children and God knows how many baby girls, woman has raped. I am sharing some links you can see what is latest happening out there.
