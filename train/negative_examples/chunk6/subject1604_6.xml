Can I create the empire and then edit the files or do I need to create a decision or something ?

	<TEXT> If this is the wrong place for this sort of post then please mods delete it and I apologize - I'm running the latest patch and trying to play the latest patch of the CKII+ mod and the CKII+_INDIA submod. Vanilla game runs fine, though when I check the mods the game opens to the very first screen before the blue loading bar screens and my cursor turns to the loading icon. 


Any ideas ? Thanks ! 


Edit: "using running" to "running"

	<TEXT> In some some medieval fantasy universes, ASOIAF and LOTR etc, and some other "historically rooted" shows, swords are passed down through families for generations or from father to son. 
    
How realistic is this, that a weapon would still function after all this time and say periodical use ? 

Assuming the blade is not ceremonial. 



Many thanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No I'm complaining that a game mechanic is pointless. Say the top score possible so far is x. Well then once you reach that you're on page 134 of the leaderboards among all the others who have the same score. Time isn't even taken into account. The leaderboards are pointless. They're just used as an excuse for the always online requirement.  </TEXT>
