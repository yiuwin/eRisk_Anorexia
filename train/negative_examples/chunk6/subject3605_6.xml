	<TITLE> Does anyone know what this movie is called? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I've been searching for this movie for a long time and I don't believe it's too old I just can remember what it is called. 
I'm sorry if my description is hazy but it's about two men who move into this neighborhood and ask their neighbors for Juice and end up murdering them and then the movie ends with them moving somewhere else and asking an old grandma for Juice or sugar. 
Any ideas what it's called?  </TEXT>
