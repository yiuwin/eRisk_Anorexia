Wow. You're definitely my senior in terms of piano experience. You should be giving me advice lol. I started quite late compared to others, many of my friends are at 7,8, and one who is at the level-above-10-that-I-can't-remember... I hope as I get busier I will still find the time to practice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you first start 30 mins is all you need, consider moving on to 45 min or an hour only when you're fairly good (think lvl 6+). Will save you a fair bit of money. I found that [hanon exercises](http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/1/1b/IMSLP91547-PMLP03129-Hanon_Final.pdf) are really helpful, play for 10 mins or so for warm up helps build up finger strength. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsmyZF6gh3E) are [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I_NYya-WWg list=WL index=12) stuff I [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am0PCTQI8iM). You have a looong journey ahead of you, stay true, my friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, different versions in the same model tree just add more fancy features that you don't really need. I came across an older version of my piano, touch and sound are exactly the same, just not as many buttons. I'll even say if you are looking at a model, maybe consider buying older versions, its usually cheaper. But if you're playing pretty advanced stuff, do consider spending extra bucks and buying a higher end model; the sound really is different, and I think its worth it. </TEXT>
