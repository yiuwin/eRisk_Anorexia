	<TEXT> Holy fudgemarshmallow, I'm late as fuck to this thread, but it's really relate-able.

I moved to the States when I was 9. I speak fluent English now (no duh I'm on Reddit?) and I started realizing the world a few years ago.

When I was young in Suwon, the only real source was just TV and my dad. My dad is an honest, hardworking person, and I knew that he always told the truth.

But...he always told the truth. Bet you were expecting a turnaround. I'm kidding.

Anyway, I just knew that the two Koreas were divided because of a war a long ago, and even to this day it seems a little complicated to me. They didn't teach much about it at my Elementary School.

Also, my grandfather served in the army during the Korean War. Lived to tell the tale, and he still runs the Marathon once a while. Strong man. Respect.

Anyway that's about it hopefully this doesn't get buried and people ask me questions, *hopefully someone sees this please.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It wouldn't, and tidal forces would cause the moon to be ripped apart.

The Earth would not fall because its relative mass does not change its orbit. You have to remember that every atom and molecule is traveling at the same speed, and remember, gravity pulls everything toward the center of mass at the same speed no matter the mass. Think of what the astronauts did in Apollo 11, dropping a hammer and feather on the moon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello /r/diepio, and what was once /r/diepiosuggestions and has crumpled.

This idea has been suggested many times already but I want to bring it up again.

Virtual leveling is essentially the game allowing you to level up, but you cannot gain anything from it. The only thing you get is the level cap, and you do not get anything bonus or stat points or anything. This would make it a fun challenge to see where you can get to, and there will be more incentive to aim for higher scores.

If you don't know what the level-correspondent point amounts are, just use Desmos. So helpful. </TEXT>
