In order to keep the thread safe I will have to be severe and perma-ban anyone who comments with spoilers. Yes this includes 'subtle hints' (people aren't dumb, they'll get what you're implying) or even telling people to get hype or to prepare to be disappointed - I'm very serious about this.

	<TITLE> Quick rundown on the rules for /r/Westworld </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-19 19:30:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all, we're nearing the premiere date, so we figure now it's a good time to detail the rules, which you can read in full [here](/r/westworld/wiki/rules). But since most people won't read that, here's a quick summary:

* For spoilers, we won't be using a tagging system. You should expect unmarked spoilers up to the latest officially aired episode in any submission or comments section unless OP specifically says otherwise, such as OP titling a submission "no spoilers". We believe that this will keep things simple and make the spoilers system minimally inconvenient for both submitters and users. It is our desire to cater the subreddit to those actively watching the show, so consider not subscribing if that won't be you. Spoilers in titles are still disallowed, and some submissions may be marked as NSFW in order to hide a spoiler.

* We will remove posts that we judge to be of low relevance, low quality, low effort, and so on. Submissions should have a direct relationship to Westworld, and not just be related through the title, like the submission of a generic reaction image.

* Standard rules for user behavior. We'll ban you if you're engaging in a bunch of personal attacks, bigotry, being a creep, troll, or otherwise bringing the subreddit down.

* Standard no piracy rule. Links to or requests for torrents/streams/etc. will be removed.

***

If you have any thoughts or questions on the rules, let us know. </TEXT>

* **Once you submit your predictions, they are final**. So don't make a typo in your username. If there's a winner with a typo in their username I won't be awarding them gold.

* Each prediction is worth 1 point, for a total of 27 points. The users who get the most points will be rewarded 1 month of reddit gold until I run out of gold to give (I have 20 months to give out). In the case of a tie after I run out, gold will be awarded to the user who submitted their predictions first. Anyone who gets a clean sweep, or is otherwise #1 in points, will receive 3 months of reddit gold.

* All questions are mandatory to answer to submit your predictions; this is to help make it so you don't accidentally skip over an option. If you aren't familiar with a category's nominees, just guess at random.

* Mods of /r/television are allowed to participate but if they win they won't receive reddit gold.

* This form will close shortly before the Emmys begin @ 5 PM PDT Sept 18th.

* Winners and their rankings will be publicly announced Sunday night or on Monday depending on the time it takes me to verify the winners. If all works out well, I should also be able to publish stats on the average and median scores, and the predictions that most redditors made a mistake on.

If you are looking for the results of the fan poll on who redditors *want* to win at the Emmys, you can view the results [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddJTLURSXyUNP3FOUjm3qXdubYaodZA5gglkI3KIgHsZHDmw/viewanalytics). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> View the results [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddJTLURSXyUNP3FOUjm3qXdubYaodZA5gglkI3KIgHsZHDmw/viewanalytics). This survey was open over the last week, people were asked to vote for who they *wanted* to win, not who they think will win.

On Saturday or early Sunday I will also be running a contest for redditors to predict the winners of the Emmys. I've got some reddit gold from the admins to give out to the people who predict the most categories correctly. Still trying to figure out an easy way for me to determine the winners, I only realized later what a massive amount of pain that could theoretically be. I might just limit the voting to a handful of big categories, with the rest of the categories only coming into play in the event of a tie. If you have any ideas on how this should be conducted in a feasible way let me know. Or spreadsheet techniques on how to identify rows that have any 26 of 27 possible winners, and so on. That would be ideal. </TEXT>

Want a flair for an old character with a new look or appearance that they had in season 3? Request it here as well.

It's very helpful if you give me the episode number, describe the scene, or even give the approximate time for the expression you want a flair made of.

Flair requests should be of characters and not objects, backgrounds etc. Any flair that could be considered a spoiler is a no-go as well.

	<TITLE> [No Spoilers] A reminder from the mods on the spoiler policy for /r/MrRobot and some changes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-17 21:58:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all, there's been some complaints recently about how we're moderating the sub in terms of spoilers, which we've taken to heart. So we're making some changes, and would also like to remind users about the details of our spoiler policy.

* The submission title tags are not just for the type of content you're submitting, but also for the type of comments you'd like to allow in the thread. If you post a thread as [No Spoilers] because you're sharing a picture of you and a cast member, that means no untagged spoilers are allowed in the comments. It is okay to scope your thread as having spoilers even if the actual linked content does not contain spoilers. AutoMod will now also comment on [No Spoilers] threads to remind other commenters of the spoiler scope.

* The [All Spoilers] tag has been removed. If you would like to talk about the whole season, tag your thread as the latest episode you're basing your information on. If you've only seen up to S2E5, then tag your thread as [Spoilers S2E5]. Alternatively there's nothing stopping you from tagging the thread as [Spoilers S2E12].

* We will be much more liberal in removing threads that might even sound like they have a spoiler in the title. A lot of reported titles don't actually contain spoilers, but they sound that way to a user who hasn't seen the latest episode, so we left them up. However this still appears to be causing frustration so we will be removing more of these types of threads. Please keep your titles vague.

* Another problem is people stating their theories as facts in their title, which can sound like a spoiler, e.g. [Spoilers S2E5] The whole show is a dream. To reduce the chances of your thread being removed, you should try to mention that this is only a theory or speculation on your part, e.g. [Spoilers S2E5] My theory: The whole show is a dream.

We are doing this as a response to users being unhappy. If our new routine does not work or is too overbearing, we are open to changing our ways again in the future.

Lastly, please report more often! Sometimes I'll find a bunch of comments complaining about an untagged spoiler or a spoiler in the title, but not a single person has reported the offending content. We can't remove something if we don't know about it. </TEXT>

#Moderation Log from May 2nd to August 1st
(We are disclosing actions as far back as we can query the log since this is our first disclosure.)

* 17,367 actions were performed by human moderators.

* 25,779 actions were performed by AutoModerator.

* Most actions by AutoModerator involve removing spam, as well as removing comments that contain some triggering phrase.

* 406 users were banned with 32 users unbanned. The vast majority of users who are banned are spammers, such as ones that rehost YouTube videos and manipulate vote counts. The next biggest group of banned users are those who participate in personal attacks against other users, then those who spoil other users. All bans are performed manually by a human - AutoModerator does not auto-ban users for anything.

* *Not counting AutoModerator* in the actions total, 7 moderators contributed 0% of moderator actions (their numbers were small enough to round to 0 - their action count ranged from 11 to 164, no moderator was completely inactive for this period).

* Still not counting AutoModerator, 1 mod contributed 1% of actions, another contributed 2% of actions, then another 5%, then another 6%, then another 36%, then the last one 44%.

* 4 new mods were added semi-recently for the first time since June of 2014, with a new mod in April (who had previously modded here years before) and 3 brand new mods in late May/early June.

#Meta

* Does our current [rule list](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/wiki/rules) satisfy you? Do you want any rules added, removed or changed? Do you perceive us as inconsistently or ineffectively enforcing any of these rules?

* On that subject, how do you feel about the "No Politics" rule, wherein we have an exception for direct video links to late night show hosts covering political content? Is this a good compromise, or should we be more strict as the United States gets closer to election day?

* How, if at all, should /r/television moderators cover the Olympics? Should we create daily discussion threads for the events, or leave coverage to sports-oriented subreddits? What threads concerning the Olympics should we allow to be posted to this subreddit? The Olympics will be occurring from August 5th to August 21st. User feedback on this would be especially helpful.

* How do you feel about the episode discussion threads created by AutoModerator? Should we set up for more threads to be created? Should we sticky more of them? Or should we only make threads for the really popular shows? </TEXT>
