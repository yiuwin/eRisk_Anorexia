	<TEXT> This is what kills me, I like my job. I have a fun job and I'm good at it. It pays alright and my boss even supports me doing comedy but the reality is it's exhausting, I am knackered all the fucking time. I barely see my friends, I have just enough time to see my girlfriend and I can't motivate myself to write more. When I get in from a full week of work and gigging then turn on the TV I instantly feel like I'm being lazy and holding myself back but fuck I've just worked all week I need a beer and to zone out, not to go to a coffee shop and sit there for 3 hours staring at blank paper.

...and this is why I fear I'll never make it. </TEXT>

The ones I had in Argentina were about 5 a bottle and they were sublime but it's a bit of a commute from London... </TEXT>
