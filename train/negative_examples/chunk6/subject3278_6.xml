	<TEXT> Had my Rift for two months now and lately its been collecting dust because I always feel tension in my eyes when I use it. It feels like I'm going cross-eyed and the feeling lingers after I've taken it off. 

I measured myself at a 63, and I can tell that I've got it set up optimally because it is the clearest possible. And I do get motion sick sometimes, but I can live with that. What I can't handle is worrying that I'm damaging my eyes. Now I'm not using it that often because its always the same result. 

Thoughts? </TEXT>
