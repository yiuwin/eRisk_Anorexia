I've known plenty of nice redditors from all points along the political and social spectrum. 

If you reword it I will *happily* re-approve it, does that sound fair? </TEXT>

But no, we aren't paid. 

And I don't think reddit has ruined it's reputation. Otherwise I wouldn't be here, nor would the other people who moderate. 

Reddit is what you make of it, just like any other site of this nature, or anyplace else people make comments. You choose what to read, how to respond, and what to believe. There are always people in place to make sure rules are followed.
