	<TEXT> if I had to guess I would say in labyrinthian where the guy is stabbed in the chest with a knife (dagger). that would be my best idea. the same place you use the wooden mask. 

edit: reasoning. the guy running the expedition was quite rude, forcing several mercenaries to stay put while he ventured through time. one time when he returned they were fed up, and evidently stabbed him with a knife (dagger). seeing as this room is (I think) in the middle everything falls into place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Race - Orc (great ability, but only once a day) 

Armour - heavy, get all the perks that increase armour rating. 

Shield - definitely, get the perks that deflect arrows and magic,  great for tanks. 

weapon - mace, get the perk that increases armour penetration, will help. 

Stats - focus mostly on health but make sure to have a decent amount of stamina.

Enchantments - 

Armour - health, stamina and heavy armour enchantments are all good.

weapons - try and enchant with life draining effects as this will help replenish your own health.  

Extra - also focus on smithing so that you can increase the strength of tour equipment.
