	<TEXT> Thank you so much. I kind of didn't know what to expect by posting this in Reddit. Now I'm much more relieved by knowing it was not 100% my fuckup, or at least something good came out of it. I'm going to try and be more cautious if other similar situations show up, yet it feels good to know that trying was a good choice. </TEXT>
