	<TITLE> Everybody Loves Dave </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-16 12:33:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Dave was bragging to his boss one day, "You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them."
Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, "OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?"
"No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it." So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,
"Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"
Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.
"No, no, just name anyone else," Dave says.
"President Obama," his boss quickly retorts.
"Yup," Dave says, "Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington," and off they go.
At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, "Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."
Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.
"Pope Francis," his boss replies.
"Sure!" says Dave. "I've known the Pope for years." So off they fly to Rome.
Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, "This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope." He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.
Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.
Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, "What happened?"
His boss looks up and says, "It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it's the common 'trade' language, but why would a race that feel superior to others not use their own language indefinitely? Even though they went to war with the empire (recently) they still seem more inclined to speak Cyrodiilic. For example during the embassy mission in the first room you see two Altmer speaking in the common tongue, and in soltheim the Altmer who buy stalhrim speak exclusively in the common tongue regardless of your presence, plus, the note about capturing the blacksmith is written in the common tongue, why? Would it not be more secretive to write it in their own language? So, basically I'm wondering why do the Altmer we see seem to exclusively speak the common tongue?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't think it lived up to its franchise (or my own bias beliefs of it). But it just didn't give as much freedom as other games by Bethesda, in it I feel as if no matter what I do the game is pushing me towards the main quest, every faction is just something that pushes you to the main quest line. I feel as if this kind of ruined the freedom of the game, but then again my expectations were pretty high, is this just me or does anyone else feel the same way?  </TEXT>
