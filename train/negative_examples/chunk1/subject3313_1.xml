	<TEXT> It's funny when I go back and watch the old seasons of SG-1 (which is hands down one of my favorite shows, let's be honest), and I'm just sitting there going, "Man, some of this is so cheesy!" Haha. But you get so wrapped up in it, you can't help but love it. Atlantis, I think, is a little darker than SG-1, and it opens up new realms since the characters are in another galaxy. I might be guilty of liking it more than SG-1. Definitely watch it! Just be prepared to be really sad when it ends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> he has really bad ocular discharge.  judging by that and the blood on his front paw, he probably got into a fight with another cat or wild animal.  take him to the humane society, and they'll take care of him.  especially if he is friendly, he'll most likely get adopted and not have to worry about fighting.  poor guy :[ </TEXT>
