	<TEXT> This piece took about hour and half. To get to this piece it took me about 1 and a half year. I am self taught that watched few videos of Alvaro Castagnet and Joseph Zbukvic, and since I don't consider myself any good I believe this is a sign that if you try really hard and work on yourself everyday you can do good art. Practice makes perfect is all that matter in my opinion. (Doesn't mean that this piece is perfect) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had this same problem when I started in 2015. I was trying and trying and never figuring it out. Than I bought videos of great Alvaro Castagnet and amazing Joseph Zbukvic (on http://www.apvfilms.com/show_artist.asp?id=24 ) Than I came across Keiko Tanabe, Michal Jasiewicz and many more. I picked up things from their videos or just from gazing at their works and started doing this. For me important thing is having a good sketch with clear lights and shadows and paint with limited colour palette.

	<TEXT> I use combination of primary colours, never the black you can buy in stores. just mix your own blacks and darks and you will see the difference. since it will be a mix you will get a hit of this and a hint of that colour in it and it will create much natural look. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for such nice words. I don't consider my self any good, I started with watercolours only in autumn 2015 so I guess I would consider myself as someone who's still learning and just trying to figure things out. Look at me, I am a 5 day user on reddit and I wake up to this. FYI I just came here to read comments on the last episode of Sherlock and ended up with this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can give a little advice here. The sky was started with pre-weting the paper with just water, than i added some yellow hue, than a bit of cadmian red and than some blues and darks. After drying that has created the effect. Some trees were painted on 1.wash wet on wet. other were painted during second wash dry on wet. third wash was just few little details with just a touch of brush. and than the birds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sure must make an easy account after such an evening I just had, so I would really like to ask people for a bit of patience. I never ever thought that any of my works would catch such an attention. Everything I sell and will sell are original works, no prints. Not yet but if there will be demand why not.
