	<TEXT> Oh we were taught in the second education round about it , 5 grade would have been a bit early in those days 95-95. I guess they didnt want to enable teasing. "Spontiouse" bleading in that age would seem wierd as fuck </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being from northern europe, this is creepy as fuck to read, the education and the assault


I think we had sex ed twice  once in fifth grade prety stright forward on how the biomechanics worked, we boys got to leave earlier cause the girls got menstruation education

The second one on the eight or ninth grade, and then we had in depth (ahaaa) education on both genitals, still remember the teacher discussing the muscular tissue of the vaginal wall. 

We did hear the sock-chewing-gum bullshit but that was from some church youths on confirmation/communion camp ( lutheran majority national religion) </TEXT>
