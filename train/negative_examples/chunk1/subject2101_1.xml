	<TEXT> TBH, I don't think I struggled with a particular concept. I had been learning English since I started school, but English teachers and supporting resources were horrible at my school. I just sort of assimilated the language from spending a ton of time on the internet. The result is that I never struggled with English academically, the tests were quite easy for me (ESL though), but I have trouble speaking face to face. I'm not perfectly fluent, and have quite a horrible accent. I'm 14 though, so hopefully I can work on fixing those issues. </TEXT>
