	<TEXT> Hey guys, this is my first ever post on Reddit so please bear with me! I'm currently a sophomore in college, and to be blatant I'm not really sure where I want to go in life. To give you a little background, my entire family is analytically-minded; my mom is the Senior Accountant Manager for her company, my dad is an Electrical Engineer, and my oldest brother studied Marketing. Currently I am majoring in Economics, and I wanted to know what careers are out there in this field? I've done some personal research, but all I have found pertaining to this field is being a financial analyst. Just to be clear, I'm going for my BBA in Economics at my University's business school.
