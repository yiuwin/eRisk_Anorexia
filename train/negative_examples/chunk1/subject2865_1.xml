	<TEXT> IMO, Ben should've been removed from the residency program. I understand what he means by "I didn't see the door" or "I saw it but I didn't register it". Nevertheless, a doctor with a good sense of judgement would've estimated that the risk of opening up the patient in the corridor is bigger than taking him up the elevator, especially when the doctor performing the procedure is still learning. And as Miranda said "6 months IS a special treatment". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just the fact that you are generalizing in that way speaks very poorly of you. That way foreigners can say the same thing about us: "They are all haters." but for example the least thing that I am is a hater. People like you make us look bad! Just because you didn't come across more contemporary thinking people that are above all that hatred and racism doesn't mean they are all like that. You should not generalize. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there, I'm from Bulgaria. It's really nice to hear you liked my country so much that you would like to come live here. What I would recommend you'd do first is choose the region where you would like to relocate. Bulgaria has lots of beautiful mountains that are very different one from another and offer different kind of things (climate-wise, livelihood-wise, soil-wise, etc.). The Rhodope mountains are one of the most loved from us Bulgarians. Secondly, I suggest you search on the Internet for articles that tell the stories of other UK people living in Bulgaria because there are lots. I could send you some but they are in Bulgarian. I suppose it would be nice for you to have some fellow Englishman around. For example I know that in NOVO SELO, LIPNITSA, VALTCHEK, PESHTERA, LEVKA, KRUSHETO live English people. And last but not least, check Google Street View just in case - some of the rural places might be on it. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't decide what says what... So I say "stop thinking about it, when the time comes you'll know what to do". It is a cliche but I believe everything has it's own time of happening and if you don't know whether to listen to your heart or your head (supposing that it's not actually the head that's saying both things) then you should give it some more time until a sign comes and guides you to the right answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey man, well it's sort of a music hub where you can connect with musicians and teachers (and fans). It has facebook-like features like posts and a newsfeeed, but additionally you get things like online jamming, a metronome app and you can give or take lessons - they've got an internal payment and booking system set up. Hit me up there if you like, my profile is Dimuker Hadzhikuker :) And gl with your efforts! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I guess YouTube and www.justinguitar.com or www.ultimate-guitar.com are a good place to go. However, you can give www.drooble.com a try too, it's a new and growing community where you can find teachers, post help requests with questions and also jam online (though only 2 people simultaneously, hope they add support for more). Hope that helped :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before sometime i was thinking about how can a musician earn a living without being world-famous. So i figured out that if you have a few projects with which you regularly do something (playing on festivals, organizing events, merch, etc) you can earn a living even without a job, but not in the beggining. So i am now working in a online platform for musicians (drooble.com), 7 days in the weeks,but still am a bassist, drummer and audio-engineer but i don't earn enough money to make a living on those projects, but i am patient ;d </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use ableton live 8 with axiom 49 and get the samples i love the most on the 8 drum pads of the keyboard, i do breakcore, ambient and experimental in that way. I think e-drums would be nice but yeah, basically if the modul is not expensive enough, you would have to position the midi data manually , which doesn't make much sense, i guess :)) </TEXT>
