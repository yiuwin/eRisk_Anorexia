	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I found out about this game Co-opoly.  http://store.toolboxfored.org/co-opoly-the-game-of-co-operatives/  It sounds pretty interesting.

In Co-opoly: The Game of Cooperatives, players collaborate to found and run a democratic business. In order to survive as individuals and to strive for the success of their co-op, players make tough choices regarding big and small challenges while putting their teamwork abilities to the test.

This is an exciting game of skill and solidarity, where everyone wins  or everybody loses. Will the Point Bank continue to dominate the players lives, or will they break free and take control by jump-starting the movement for a truly democratic and cooperative economy in their community?

I was wondering whether anyone has tried it and could recommend it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Could Co-Op XCOM Work? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-25 01:43:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With people talking about the possibility of Twitch Plays XCOM, I was thinking that I'd really love a co-op XCOM.  One person would be Squad Leader and determine turn order.  People could talk freely to coordinate, and each individual would control one XCOM soldier whom they'd be able to customize.  Heck, maybe even make it so they carry over from game to game, and when you die, you have to start a new soldier from scratch.  I think it'd be fun, especially with actual voice support, although possibly frustrating if you set off a pod and everyone else decides to leave you as bait...

Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I go to church with some friends once in a blue moon because my partner likes it, but sometimes I feel that my friends think that I'm going to become Christian and join the church, and I feel sort of bad, like I'm leading them on somehow.  Has anyone else been in this situation?  Did you ever feel that you had to clarify things?  I don't want them to get their hopes up, but they're never pushy or explicit enough to really warrant me directly saying that I can't possibly imagine ever believing in any god. </TEXT>
