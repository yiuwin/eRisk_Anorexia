	<TEXT> It wouldn't be Trump who establishes a puppet, it would be the CIA who have been planning for war in Syria for at least a decade. Trump doesn't know what he's doing but the CIA knows exactly what the goal is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my biggest fears with the JWST is the reaction wheels failing. Apparently the reaction wheels were made by the same people who made the failed reaction wheels on Kepler. I don't have a source for that, it's just something I picked up somewhere and don't really know how to verify. 

Regardless, the more moving parts, the more possibility of a part failure. JWST has a lot of moving parts, particularly with its initial deployment/unfurling phase. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is so much to do that doesn't involve free roam PVP that I gave up trying to write a list out. GTA Online has much more content than it did upon initial release. </TEXT>
