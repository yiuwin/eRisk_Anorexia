	<TEXT> Half of me wanted to see how you'd reply, surprised you're this accepting of it - the k stands for kriminel (spelling) meaning detective. PP stands for polezipistole (spelling) meaning police pistol. The PPK was issued to detectives. The PPK/S was created for importation or manufacture by S W I think in the US. S standing for special or something. 

Edit: S standing for sport, apparently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is the killing curse used when a cutting spell, such as the one used in the last film, could be used instead ? Less light, noise, and more visual - you can be sure a person is dead, and it is more shocking to anyone who would see it happen.  </TEXT>
