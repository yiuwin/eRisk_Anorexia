	<TEXT> Second grade little girl. I have to pee like hell. And I raise my hand like a good child. So the bitch teacher, instead of letting me go right away makes me stand next to her till she's done talking. I stand there fidgeting with my dress straps while she's chatting away. Somehow, God knows why, I manage to loosen the straps just enough to fall off my shoulders. Thus causing my dress to fall down to my ankles in front of the whole class. I never moved so quickly. I bent down so fast and picked up my dress I'm not sure you would have seen me move. But I'm sure the whole class did.  </TEXT>

My biological mother was the same. Abusive, verbally as well. A total alcoholic maniac. Oh you just got $20? Congrats on buying alcohol and cigarettes. And her boyfriend abused the both of us. The look on her face when she said the police had arrived was priceless. Of course her boyfriend tried to hide and was found. The last thing I seen on my mother was the back of her head. That was 14 months ago. I'm free as a bird.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I went on a Facebook LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Transgender) page and posted about a recent scenario involving my seven and four year old cousins. Basically, I was trying to teach them about tolerance and respect toward Gay people. Then some guy comments as follows:

Ignorant Guy: you are teaching them to be gay.

Me: noo, gay can't be taught, but tolerance and respect can.

IG: actually you are teaching them to be gay. So stop it, being gay is wrong.

Me: then why are you on a LGBT page

IG: looking up hot lesbians, how 'bout you?

What was the dumbest thing you have ever heard in a conversation that resulted in mental face palm? </TEXT>
