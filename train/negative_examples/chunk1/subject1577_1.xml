	<TEXT> I don't often post, but I've always been a terrible sleep talker, the best one that I've been told about is one night at a party I had fallen asleep while a few other people had stayed awake to watch the exorcist. As the movie is reaching its end my friends told I sat bolt upright, and loudly proclaimed, "hand of the devil," and then proceeded to cackle. I of course have no memory of this event, my friends still tease me about today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> O.K.  I haven't really written a lot, I'm usually a lurker with occasional pokes through the protective awkward penguin layer, but I figured I'd share this here...
I had recently gotten out of the hospital after finding a new, and exciting allergy to bee stings, and was trying to get some sleep.  When ever I would fall asleep though I would immediately (it seemed) have soul crushing nightmares. suffice to say I was not tiptop.  It was through all of this mental fog that my dog walks into my bedroom, its eyes catching the light giving it that "I've walked out of your nightmares" gleam and gives one single low grumble "bark" 
An odd mix of horror, and a sense of grand importance immediately hit me, my dog was trying to tell me something, something very important, I stared at her for what seemed 10 minutes, finally she walked around the corner, disappearing into the kitchen, I got up following after her stepping into the kitchen I look out through the glass door and out on the back porch sat my dog patiently waiting to be let in.  Taking an inordinate amount of time to open the door, I finally let her in after which she gave her little "thanks" bark, and proceeded into the living room to climb up into the recliner chair and fall asleep.  After that I decided sleep wasn't such a great idea.      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw this post a little while ago, and it rekindled memories of hours, and hours of frustration, (the kind that only a 10 year old can know) and then, sadness, when it looked like no one else remembered this awesome game.  I figured with all of the old nintendo games getting love why hadn't crystalis, so I figured I'd give it a try, not perfect, but I think good. I even joined reddit, woot!
