	<TEXT> The key differences is
1.check if it's an opinion piece or not. 
2. Determine bias 
3. If bias is found check the source or other news outlet

I fucking sell newspapers door 2 door and once had someone tell me they get their news from TMZ. Most people don't trust the news to give an unbiased opinion and have moved on to echo chambers or blissful ignorance.

Sorry for the rant.

	<TEXT> It's disgusting to think that YouTube can pick and choose who gets money based on their content. The advertisers don't give a fuck they just want the views.

Now many of us won't boycott YouTube so that's out of the question but I think a Thunderclap will get there attention. I think that's what it's called where everyone shares a video all at once by various channels and that might be effective here 

*So Phil make a open video to YouTube we can share and spread to everyone 

If anyone had any ideas I'd love to hear them and I'm sure Phil would too.

*Edit missed a sentence

	<TEXT> So with 24 events in the bag and the payout averaging $161,145 (approximately 6k a fighter). This year's pay out will be about $7 million dollars this year. that leaves me believing that each year we will see a slight increase in the pay out to fighters kind of build it up year after year which would show the fighters that over the long run they will make more and more.

If they build 2015/2016 7 mill 2016/2017 8.5 mill 2017/2018 10 mill 2018/2019 12 mill 2019/2020 14 mill 2020/2021 16 mill 

Works out to be 67 million which is around the total worth of the deal

	<TITLE> (rant)fighters pay the journey of robbie lawler and the problem with aljamian sterling </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-21 10:20:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> this is the fighter pay story of ufc champ robbie lawler and the reason why fighters like aljamian sterling wont get what they ask for just by making noise.
-first 18 fights made 1k-20k a fight progressive build 

his elite xc days 30k-45k 

strikeforce he made 80k average with the lowest being 65k and highest 150k

his second stint in the ufc he made 105k which build up thru wins to his last title defense he made 500k 

for those who say fighters dont make enough i conclude that they havent been fighting long enough after 16 years in combat sports robbie lawler paid his dues and it paid off after 6 years of being a pro.

aljamian sterling has been fight as a pro for 4 years  and has only fought in the ufc 4 times 

he started out as 8k/8k  and progressed to 14k/14k at what seems the normal build up rate of ufc fighters on a win streak. the more they win the more they make.  

the ufc wont pay this kid anything more he will get the same progressive contract and once he defeats a champion he can start getting paid the big bucks till then he needs to shut up and pay his dues just like everyone else.

sorry for any errors

	<TEXT> So read a post earlier and most people were saying we can't do it we would have to send robots. 
 
So I doubt think we are limited to just setting up base in just are solor system as we self evolve thru technology I think we can in essence change our species to fit our surroundings. Modifying our DNA is just beginning.

We will genetically rebuild are body's for space flight and then travel to what ever planets we can change are genetics to suit that planet and our needs.

What do you guys think will we be able to solve the problem with colonization thru genetics or will we still only be able to explore with robots. </TEXT>
