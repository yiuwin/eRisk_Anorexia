	<TEXT>   Getting the order for the back nine seemed like a surprise.

It wasn't. When a show premiering in the fall has the option for additional episodes to be ordered the producers are hoping that option will be exercised (not getting extra episodes in that situation means the show is pretty much guaranteed to be cancelled), and in Lucifer's case its fall ratings were solid so the back order was not surprising. And many of the show's contracts will account the option for the extra episode order, for instance Lucifer's main cast members wouldn't have been allowed to book other gigs for the time when episodes 14-22 would be filming (unless the producers okayed it). </TEXT>

But he could easily learn. He seems to know quite a bit about everyone on Team Flash so it's not unreasonable that he'd sniff out an attempt to hide Iris, plus he could also just torture one (or more) of them until they reveal Iris's location. 

Anyways hiding her on a different Earth is effectively no different from just sending her to a different city. </TEXT>

Well...

 all the major broadcast networks let you stream their shows from their websites and apps

People who are brilliant in their field can often be surprising clueless in others, and many companies have woefully inadequate IT practices (and while Team Sky may be high-budget in the world of cycling, their ~$30 million in annual revenue is really not that large as far as companies go). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  at least 2 had full seasons from the beginning.

None of the shows I listed had full seasons from the beginning. It's true that only 3 of the shows on that list had 9 additional episodes ordered, but that list was just from this year; do you want a list of all the shows that had 13+9 orders in recent? Because I can get that, and I can guarantee that of that list Lucifer is the only show which delayed airing its 13th episode until anytime later than March. So should I believe that Lucifer takes significantly longer to produce than basically all other broadcast dramas? Or that the delay is for a different reason?

 Gotham are delaying while having a full schedule.

And it's the same break as Lucifer (maybe plus or minus a week). Again: What's more likely: (a) Lucifer and Gotham both happen go on break at the same time for completely unrelated reasons, or (b) Lucifer and Gotham both go on break at the same time for the same reason. 

 None of your examples are of picking up that many episodes, nor are any of them the quality of Lucifer. 

Three of them (Bull, MacGyver, Designated Survivor) were also 9-episode additional orders, and again there are numerous examples of shows getting back nines if you look beyond just this year. As for 'quality', nothing about Lucifer indicates that it would take abnormally long to produce compared to other network dramas.

 Some from Lucifer did say they didn't have all the episodes done.

They obviously don't have all the episodes done yet, most full-season shows are still filming currently. But has anyone from the show said that the reason for the abnormally long delay was because of production issues? To my knowledge the answer to that is 'no'. 

The only evidence that the abnormally long delay is due to the show's production being behind is random people on reddit have said it, without giving any further explaination or evidence to support the theory (and most were likely just repeating what they saw another redditor say). That is not a good reason to believe it. You ask how I could know this isn't the reason, but you don't ask how one could possibly know that it *is* the reason. </TEXT>

That doesn't make it legal; similar services have been shut down in the past. Of course they're not not going to *say* that it's not legal because that would be moronic.

 "Our free plan includes all major terrestrial stations that as an American citizen or resident you would normally be able to receive for free"

The issue is that those terrestrial stations have the rights to broadcast to people physically in the US, not the rights to broadcast to US citizens wherever in the world they happen to be. To legally broadcast or stream in other countries they would need to have purchased the rights to do so in each country, regardless of whether the viewers are American citizens/residents (which ustvnow doesn't actually verify).

Using ustvnow's paid service in the US is [presumably] legal, but that's about it. </TEXT>

 Broadcast is dying

Nothing in that link shows that *broadcast* is dying, it's all about cable. And I already acknowledged that cable is not doing well (aside from premium cable).

 Because Nielson is still the gold standard of viewership measurement and very little has been done to take other considerations.

Nielson is still the standard for pricing the sales of commercials on the linear broadcast. That says little about whether or not networks are considering other areas.

Networks are very aware of streaming; all the major broadcast networks let you stream their shows from their websites and apps, and they often advertise those streaming options. Those views are not counted in Nielsen's C3 and C7 ratings because they typically have a different commercial load than the linear broadcast, but the network still counts and considers them. However they don't release those numbers to the public (just like Netflix doesn't release its numbers, and how most of Nielsen's data is not released to the public), so they're not heavily discussed in the media. Also 3 of the 4 big broadcast networks collectively own 90% of Hulu, and the 4th has its own paid streaming service.

	<TITLE> [S1E9] Regarding Cat Grant and Supergirl's Identity </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-27 12:04:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I was rewatching the scene [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynPZ0qyL9Hw) where Kara and J'onn convince Cat that Kara isn't Supergirl, and the more I watch it the more I'm convinced that Cat still knew and was just playing along (albeit confused as to how Kara and Supergirl were both there at once).

In particular, as 'Supergirl' is leaving Cat says "Kara", then immediately afterwards turns to Kara and says "And Kyra..." So Cat knew the proper pronunciation of Kara's name, yet only used it when seemingly directed at Supergirl. The only way that makes sense is if she knew, and her then talking about how they don't look anything alike was a red herring to make Kara think she didn't know.

Also Cat's behavior towards Kara and Supergirl since then fits with her knowing that Kara is Supergirl. For instance in 1.16, Cat didn't seem to be concerned that Kara was missing at the exact time Supergirl that had gone off the rails, and the interaction between Cat and Supergirl  at the end of that episode was far more similar to the interactions Cat had had with Kara that those we'd seen her have with Supergirl.

Edit: Ok certain details of this may not be quite right (see the comments), but I still stand behind the main idea; Cat knows, she's just keeping quiet about it. </TEXT>
