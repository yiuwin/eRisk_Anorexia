	<TEXT>  shame not a lot of people have starz so not a lot of people know about it.

actually the show has a huge fanbase. the biggest i've ever seen for a starz series. I was on twitter last summer and it's all they use to talk about on there. it's just not talked about much on reddit considering the target demographic. 

As the titled said, it's the 2nd higest rated series on premium cable.  </TEXT>
