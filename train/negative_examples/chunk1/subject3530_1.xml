	<TEXT> Not a dad story, but every time I was told to turn off/on the light, I said no. Then I turned it on/off anyway.  I was then told not to say "no", which I then thought was a bad word and never said it. My parents caught on and asked me awful,"Can you do this?" questions which I had to say yes to. I eventually started saying no again, but felt wrong doing it.

Tldr:Thought no was bad, parents exploited. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok I will be quick. The website does not show the information I need, so I will ask here.
1. What will the lunch selection be?
2.Is there a player limit?
3.Is there a register cutoff.
4.Do I need to register now to get an open spot if they are limited?
I hope I can get these answered. Tips for the tournament would be appreciated as well. Never went to a tournament of this magnitude so I am a bit nervous.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Deci S_oon_tir_(Sorry I can't spell it without autocorrect.). Deci tanks shots while Interceptor arc dodges around the prime target. As for upgrades it's hard to go wrong on the deci, but Interceptor needs Royal Guard, Stealth Device, Hull Upgrade, and Push the limit if you have the expansion. Autothrusters instead of Hull if you have Starviper.
