I wouldn't worry too much - it's already received a full season order, and it's a fucking BEAST in Live+7 ratings. I think ABC is pretty damn happy, especially considering it's in a 10 pm slot on ABC (where many shows have flat-out bombed), and it's doing far better in that time slot than its shows in the past.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a very good debut for Supergirl. I hope this bodes well for the return of the wonderful Crazy Ex-Girlfriend on October 21st. The CW has so many quality shows these days, so it's nice to see them performing well.

	<TEXT> This is incredibly disappointing and disturbing news, especially since I was always a fan of Devin's writing since his CHUD days (he was always controversial in his very outspoken views). I will continue to read the site, though, since they have some great writers (like Meredith Borders and Brian Collins).  </TEXT>

Hopefully Timeless settles around a 1.3-1.4 - I think it's pretty fun so far.  </TEXT>

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this event alone (along with Trump's probable disastrous debate tomorrow) makes Clinton go up another 2-5 points in the polls nationally (where she is already up an average of 4-5 points nationally). 

Trump, I think you're fucked.  </TEXT>

Empire is really falling fast - this was almost a series-low. 

Hopefully Designated Survivor recovers next week - it will surely do great in the Live+3 and Live+7 ratings, though.  </TEXT>
