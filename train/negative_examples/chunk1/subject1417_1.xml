Did I catch it at a bad time or does no one play it on there anymore? Has the boat just sailed or is there something I can do?

Please don't just put 'Get it on PC or Mac' I don't have a decent enough PC and can't afford to upgrade. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had to study this as part of my Degree and I'd never noticed before but this film actually centers a lot round Nazi Propaganda. The SS troopers, fighting a non human enemy, being a citizen not a civilian. Even the uniforms are similar to that of the SS. Don't get me wrong it's not pro-Nazi in the slightest, it was just an example of their use of propaganda and brain washing a populace to fight an enemy.

Also it fucking rocks, I love this film. "Kill them....Kill them all!" </TEXT>

I told him I wasn't a Mr Man and my skin wasn't that colour so he asked what colour i wanted and I said black and he said he wasn't the owner of a fancy dress shop.....Touch Mr Doctor man!

I was still at school at the time which was the hardest when I had the eye patch but I also went on a date with it. It went a lot better than I expected but still never went on a second date </TEXT>
