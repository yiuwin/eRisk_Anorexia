	<TEXT> My friend was an extra on Vanilla Sky once. He told me they were instructed not to speak to Tom Cruise at all because he was focused and in character. Well after one of the takes one of the other extras asked Tom if he would read his script. Everyone was grimacing and prepared for the worst, but Tom said he'd read through it, and if it was any good he'd contact him. Then the guy is supposed to have said, "And don't think just because I gave it to you that you get to be in it because your last movie sucked."
Then Tom had someone escort him off the set. </TEXT>
