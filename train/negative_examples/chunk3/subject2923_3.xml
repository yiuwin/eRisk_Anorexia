	<TEXT> And found a Maestro MP-1 today for $100! I can't take it home from the shop for a couple of weeks because of used merchandise laws in my county, but I'm super excited. It's the only phaser I've used that immediately spoke to me. It sounds so detailed and full but not over the top. Plus you can control the speed and depth with your feet! The same shop has a Maxon ph-350 and a stage phaser both priced really well. Anyway, just sharing my excitement. I'm itching to take this thing home. 

As you were, pedal friends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I'm recording, if I'm trying to accomplish what I think you're talking about, I run my guitar through an re 201 space echo first. Overloading the mic input sounds pretty great. The echo you can have on or off. Also it's possible to plug your guitar into the PA input and get only the wet signal into your daw. If you turn the repeats all the way down and turn up the speed as fast as it will go in mode 1 the latency is manageable. </TEXT>
