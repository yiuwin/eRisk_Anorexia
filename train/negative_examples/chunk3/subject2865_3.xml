	<TEXT> It turned out that my Philosophy teacher was dating a class mate of mine. Me and my two best friends were the first who found out. They talked on the phone during recesses. A class mate of mine accidentally saw them kissing in the center of the city. The girl attended additional classes with the teacher to "prepare for a Philosophy Olympiad" yeah right... :D In the end, the whole school found out.

Did I mention my teacher was 50+ years old, married with children, and my class mate was 15 back then? Their relationship continued for five years.......... </TEXT>
