	<TEXT> Of corse, I will try to pick the things I learned the hard way.
First of all i guess it is important to use quality tools /meaning colors, paper and brushers/ In terms of paper I use paper made for watercolors, which means it is heavier and can take more water then other papers /usualy these papers are 200g,300g or even hevier/ Then theres the colors I personaly use winsor newton cotman colors in tubes since they I believe it is easier to pick the color from the tube and make some details at the end. Also I find them better to mix. Then dont be that guy who wants to paint everything with every color he/she sees. I am writing this just because i was this guy, and thats no good. The key for me is simplyfing what i am about to paint. Sketch is an important part of the proces, it gives me the idea of light and shadows and in my opinion in watercolors its all about light and shadow, warm and cold spaces and interconnecting them. Also I find it very useful to work with limited color palette. Usually I pick like 2 or 3 primary colors and work with them the whole time, just by mixing other colors into them. This way the outcome will look more compact and work better as a whole. A good thing is masking tape. It is very useful since the paper wont be moving while you paint, but make sure to try it first before painting to find out if it doesnt rip your paper, since it would be a pitty to destroy a nice work after an hour of painting just by taking the tape of. I hope this was for you at least helfpul. If you have any further questions I will be glad to answer them if I can. Good luck with your work and many nice watercolors is what I wish to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest I dont have anything except one book. The books is by  Dougles R. Graves and is caled drawing portraits, That should give you the basic idea. After that I just spent some time at pinterest searching for different styles and works of pencilwork, after that is just about finding the right pictures, with the right light and shadows and after that its just about trying on an on and then finding your styles, what is best for you, sharp or round edges etc. I hope this was at least a little bit helpful, since I myself am a selflearner in terms of drawing, skething and painting, and I am not that good at explaining things I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thank you for your understanding. To avoid any complications or negative outcome I just wanted to ask if you have specific request for the packaging. Usually I ship biger pieces in Tubuses, which means the paper is rolled, since there is problem to find suitable big and safe envilope. But I can check at the post office if they sell also same big and safe envilopes. If not I will have to go in tubus, But please dont worry, all international competitions in watercolor medium take only tubuses, so theres no problem to straighten the paper under the glass after framing. </TEXT>
