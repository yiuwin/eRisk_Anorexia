	<TEXT> Hey PF long time lurker, first time poster. I'm a 16     y/o and I've had a job for a few years now. At first I blew through lots of my cash income, but recently turned around and started saving. I have about 500 dollars in precious metals and will have 3 k expendable cash by the end of the summer. looking for some suggestions on what to do with investments other than just let my
money sit! </TEXT>
