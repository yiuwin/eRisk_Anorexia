	<TEXT> It was weird seeing cops in the malls having their guns out, of course it's for security but that's something you don't see Paul Blart do or in Europe.

Another odd experience was at this resort, where one of the guards would stroll around during the dark. Slowly swinging his sawed off shotgun with his finger on the trigger. The staff are supposed to smile to everyone so the guards would smile too. It felt a bit like the scene from The Purge where a girl with a smiley mask was swinging a machete. Some other guard would do the same thing with a revolver. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All other escalations had some small reason that caused the rise in escalation. Like the last one was about the speakers or the mines. What's the current reason for this escalation? Is it because the world reacted negatively towards the tests? (H-bomb tests and satellite/missile test.) </TEXT>

My sister or grandma would say that I should take the disc out and blow the dust off. Of course we also wiped it out carefully with some cloth. But I wonder if what they said originally came from them cleaning the old cartridges. </TEXT>

They think that the urge is purely righteous, and everything in the way should be blamed for causing the urge.

Thought the first part was only a problem in 3rd world countries, but after trying to search for an article about one. I was wrong, it seems to happen a lot in the US and Europe too... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The maker of flappy bird got so much shit on from everyone. Seemed to get more hate than other games (or companies don't react much with outraged messages of copying) and other messages of how hard the game was or how stupid it was. The maker got sad and deleted it, even though it was completely free and add free. 

People seem to get really pissed over remakes that get more popular. Some probably deserve it if they get money from copying. 

I think he completely ended his hobby of making games after that... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to climb pine a pine tree too! It was hard to catch the first branch to climb, but then the rest of it was so easy to climb. I kept climbing the same tree over and over again, each time a bit higher. I can't remember exactly how high I was, but I got up to the point where the trunk was thin enough to sway it around with my own weight. I could look out and see my house from there! Then a branch broke off and I was holding to dear life, kicking around to grab on something and not to dangle with one branch under my armpit. I grabbed the trunk and silently went back down.

Never tried it again after that. </TEXT>
