	<TEXT> Lol, I guessed you were female but didn't say in case I got it wrong.
 how our own pasts and memories affect our relationships with other people

That's something I thought about too. Memories and experiences, not names or titles, define a person. I would be much more worried if I can't remember what I did with my family than if I forgot my name.

 nobody will relate or understand, that what I think happens to everyone really only happens to me

I know I can relate to 'The Thespian', I've always joked that I could move to a new place and use a new name, and totally shed my old self. Nobody would suspect anything unless they meet my old friends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Face it, Tarquin, you've lost," I said, facing the king of this Empire. "Our army has taken over all the surrounding cities and fortresses, you are isolated and cut off from help. Resisting will only delay the revolution." 

"Oh really?" He turned around and stared at me with steel eyes. "Then why have you asked for a parley? Couldn't Brutus the Brave storm the capitol and conquer the throne?"

"You know as well as I why we're here to talk," I answered. "Your defeat is inevitable, I do not want to spill unnecessary blood. Step down peacefully, and we shall spare the lives of you and your family. Refuse, and this will be your end."

"Rubbish! Tarquin spat. "You've spilled more blood than anyone can measure, you've sent thousands of men to their doom! And here you are talking about unnecessary blood?"

"It is the people's will, they chose to go to war," I replied. "We will give you two days to consider the offer. If you have no answer by then, we will attack."

His eyes narrowed. "Oh you can have my kingdom Brutus," He hissed, "but over my dead body. I will not surrender. This is my final decision." 

"Very well," I nodded. I started towards the door, accompanied by my guards. "I will warn you Tarquin: When the time comes, let go. Nothing lasts forever. I will still send a messenger two days later in case you change your mind."
***
The capitol fell after two months in siege. Tarquin was found dead in his bedroom, a dagger through his heart. The empire became a republic, with Brutus as one of its consuls. The last king was later known as Tarquin the Proud, the man who couldn't let go of his kingdom to save his life. </TEXT>
