I don't entirely get why he ghosted me either...I would like to say that I'm not looking for him or would date him if he came back but I totally created a second Facebook to check his and I tried calling with a friends phone. I'm pathetic  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My now ex :( had some medical worries and he thought he was dying. My entire family is in the medical field so I knew that while he was really sick he would most likely recover just fine. He proposed that I start dating other people...I didn't do that. He also has ptsd from being raped a couple days before Christmas so we haven't had sex in a while and he asked me to get a fwb. I did that one and he seemed fine with the guy. Wanting a threeway when he gets better...I think there were probably plenty of signs that I missed. This still sucks though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happened to me today. I spent months with a guy who I feel for and thought he feel for me too. He ghosted me today. 

You have no idea how much I want him to send me a text calling me boo again but that's not what's good for me and I don't think that's what's good for you. 

Remember the pain you went through that first day, I'm feeling it now. You can forgive him but I wouldn't be able to trust him. Trust is what a relationship is based on. 

I hope everything works out for you with whatever choice you make. Please keep me posted so I can learn from your choices.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was ghosted by my now ex bf today. Thus far I've drank a bottle and a half of wine, took a bath and listened to music (hand of god, Jon bellion is amazing)


My plan is to just be sad for a little while and do the things I like. Go on a date with one of the guys who asked me out, paint, help at a food pantry. Do things that make you feel good. Do they for yourself not to make the other guy jealous. It's tough and this is just day one for me too. 

I wish you the best of luck my broken heart bro </TEXT>
