Generally if the problem is just "(cast/crew member) is a douche!" I don't really care. I still like Rick and Morty even though I don't at all like Dan Harmon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't follow Harmontown that well, but I do know his twitter. He frequently goes on tirades where he belittles his fanbase if anyone dares to question him, and then insults them in his own tweets, and calls it #harmonblock(year). Try searching #harmonblock2015 to see more. 

Also a few months ago, he ruthlessly tore open one fan who barely spoke English. He tweeted for an hour about how much of a fucking loser the kid was, and when people told him to knock it off, he started a HARMONBLOCK again, and called people who were telling him to stop antagonizing the kid cowards and insulted them in a series of several different tweets.

Reading the /r/harmontown thread about it - https://redd.it/3pk8h4 - shows me that Dan being a bully to his fanbase isn't a new thing. So yeah, he seems like an asshole to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup. The book is surprisingly emotional and, outside of some of Tommy's eccentricities, it doesn't really attempt to be a comedy. So... this doesn't appear to be in good hands. And Franco is also a horrible director. So there's that.
