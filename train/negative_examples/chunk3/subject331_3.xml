	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Premise:** Hap Collins is a white working class laborer who spent time in federal prison as a young man for refusing to be drafted into the military and serve in the Vietnam War. In his late forties, he is often haunted by the various unpleasant jobs he's held over the years such as working at an aluminum chair factory and working the East Texas rose fields. The two now work for the former police officer turned private investigator Marvin Hanson. Hap tries his best to avoid violence and also tries his best to avoid the taking of another human life. Often lovesick, most of his relationships haven't worked out. He is currently with his on-again-off-again girlfriend Brett Sawyer. Some of his past has been taken from Mr. Lansdale's own past. The stories are told from Hap's narrative point of view. Not as quick to anger as Leonard, he often finds himself attempting to talk Leonard out of committing serious violence.

Observations:

 Netflix is on fire with redditors, scoring 6 slots in the top 10 shows of 2015 vote.

 The popularity of Fargo may surprise many, having scored the #3 slot for favorite shows of all time, bumping The Wire down a rank.

 Amazon continues to struggle for recognition and popularity, at least among redditors. Their biggest fare yet, Man in the High Castle, ranked directly beneath True Detective Season 2 at #22 for the favorite new shows of 2015 question.

 Despite the survey not being linked to any anime subreddit, One Punch Man had a very strong showing, being the 14th favorite new show of /r/television.

 Another strong showing was had by sci-fi series The Expanse, being the 15th new favorite show of 2015 with only 4 episodes out at the time of the survey.

 South Park clawed its way into the top 10 after a season primarily focused on tackling political correctness, a message redditors appear to have been receptive to.

 The power of a single vote does matter. There are a quite few ties in the top #100, and Rick and Morty edged ahead of Arrested Development by a single vote, and The Wire is ahead of Parks and Recreation by 2 votes.

 In an amazing coincidence, 30 Rock again ranks #30, tripling its vote count from 101 to 303. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In case you missed it, a vote for the Golden Globes portion of the television awards was held in this sub recently for a few days. People could only vote on the actual nominations, so if a show or actor wasn't nominated by the Golden Globes, they weren't eligible to be voted on in the fan poll either. Check out the full results [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nhHN2-OTAMNUxsoMGMwpxgQuipBBgl4fjoJEnTVyCGU/viewanalytics).

The winners:

#Best Drama Series: 
*Mr. Robot* (49.7% of votes)

#Best Musical or Comedy Series
*Silicon Valley* (47.9%)

Confirming that redditors love Silicon Valley, but the show is unlikely to be a winner tonight at the awards.

#Best Performance in a Television Series - Drama (Actor)
*Rami Malek in Mr. Robot as Elliot Alderson* (32.5%)

I know many Mad Men fans just collectively groaned at reddit, but Jon Hamm and Rami Malek were literally tied vote for vote for many days before Malek pulled ahead by 30 votes in the last 2 days of the poll.

#Best Performance in a Television Series - Drama (Actress)
*Robin Wright on House of Cards as Claire Underwood* (45.5%)

Despite Wright ultimately emerging as the clear winner, this was perhaps the most open category for a while, with Eva Green initially ranking first before being usurped by Viola Davis before Wright rocketed ahead.

#Best Performance in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy (Actor)
*Aziz Ansari on Master of None as Dev Shah*

An unsurprising result given many redditors' affinity for Netflix (and Master of None), with most other shows in the category being on less watched services such as Starz and Amazon Prime.

#Best Performance in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy (Actress)
*Julia Louis-Dreyfus on Veep as President Selina Meyer* (58.5%)

#Best Performance in a Miniseries or Television Film (Actor)
*Patrick Wilson on Fargo as State Trooper Lou Solverson* (45.6%)

Though Wilson was the clear favorite, Oscar Isaac continues to be a rising star coming in second place for his role on Show Me a Hero, with Idris Elba a close 3rd for his role on Luther (which recently aired a two episode season 4).

#Best Performance in a Miniseries or Television Film (Actress)
*Kirsten Dunst on Fargo as Peggy Blomquist* (76.1%)

#Best Supporting Performance in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film (Supporting Actor)
*Christian Slater on Mr. Robot as Mr. Robot* (54.1%)

#Best Supporting Performance in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film (Supporting Actress)
*Uzo Aduba on Orange Is the New Black as Suzanne "Crazy Eyes" Warren* (47%)

Though Aduba comfortably won over the others, this category had the most split votes of all, with the other contenders all about equally dividing the vote at 13% each.

#Best Miniseries or Television Film
*Fargo* (88%)

This sets Chuck on a collision course with one of the most powerful men on Wall Street. While it could be a career-defining case for Chuck, he must tread carefully, because his wife, Wendy Rhoades, is the in-house performance coach at Axe Capital and Axes key confidante. But a costly purchase by Axe gives Chuck the opening he needs, setting off a cat and mouse game where the stakes are high and intensely personal.
