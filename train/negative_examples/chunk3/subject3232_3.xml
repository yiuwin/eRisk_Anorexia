	<TEXT> Hey there! 

Welcome to /r/iamveryculinary! This is a sub for enjoying the smug and pedantic comments about food that we often see online. These comments don't have to lead to arguments or drama (although that's always an added bonus), they just need to make you roll your eyes super hard. 

I'm currently tinkering a bit with the CSS, but because of my busy schedule it will probably take me a little while to get everything looking spiffy, so pardon some of the clashing colors while I figure out what I want to do with it--and if you have CSS experience and want to help out, please send me a message!

Please check out our sidebar for submitting and commenting rules (don't worry, it's a short list). I hope you enjoy this little sub and find it entertaining.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> We need another movie like Cloak and Dagger </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-08 02:28:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Cloak and Dagger](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087065/) was on TV today, and it brought back lots of good memories. This was one of my favorite movies as a child in the 80s, and although I don't like the trend of remaking anything precious from the past, I think we need more movies like this now and I haven't seen anything for kids that really fits the bill. It's exciting, it gives the child protagonists realy agency, it's genuinely frightening in parts (the only people in the car used to really give me nightmares), it involves video games and espionage, and it also plays on the desire that every kid has to be closer to their parent(s). I think you could make a similar movie with a girl in the lead and a boy helping, too--it's pretty easily reversible. You can still use video games as a delivery mechanism for the info, and you can still have the espionage story. Even if it is not specifically remade, I think a spy story with a child protagonist and an imaginary spy friend could be done today with the right balance of drama and fun to be a really great kids' movie. 

Any thoughts? Would you want this? If so, who would you cast? I think the casting would be pretty damn flexible, so there are so many possibilities... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Think back to the glorious drama of last year, and the banning of FPH and the exodus of Ellen Pao! Remember Voat? Remember the multi-headed hydra of fat hate-themed subs? Well, even though this is a post from today, it feels like last year--kind of a greatest hits album of 2015 summer drama. 

Very quick background for those who don't remember last year's dramawave--check out this [Out of the Loop post](https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/39bzdf/why_was_rfatpeoplehate_along_with_several_other/?st=isui8m0p sh=17d9b6a1) on the subs that were banned and the top comments of [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/36w9fy/what_is_happening_to_reddit_and_why_are_people/?st=isuiaoo5 sh=d0fbdd96) to learn more about Pao and Voat. Pao was widely blamed for Victoria's firing, which, of course, [spawned the most downvoted comment ever](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/csqg24d?st=isuideyy sh=3e9022d8), right here in our humble little sub!

Anyway, many of these arguments have been resurrected today in /r/pussypassdenied as they discuss the news that Pao will have to pay court costs. One of the reasons this feels familiar is because the news itself isn't really news--the linked source is from last year. But the drama is fresh!

[Free speech drama](https://np.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/51qecz/ellen_pao_officially_found_liable_for_roughly/d7e3n4h?context=3 st=isuht6xj sh=62adc641)

	<TEXT> For the first time in 50 years, the Dallas Morning News has not endorsed the Republican candidate for President. Dallasites discuss--here's the [full post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/51fhuy/the_dallas_morning_news_doesnt_endorse_the/?sort=confidence sh=d3e16af0 st=iss6qged). 

Two big arguments break out, both about Trump. 

The question "What exactly has he said?" [kicks off a 54 child argument.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/51fhuy/the_dallas_morning_news_doesnt_endorse_the/d7bkvg6?context=3 st=iss6r3o2 sh=e9d811bb).

	<TEXT> **Background:** So yesterday [Chris Brown was arrested](http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/chris-brown-be-arrested-after-woman-claims-he-threatened-her-n640126) for allegedly threatening a woman with a gun in his Tarzana home. The cops got a warrant, searched the home, and Brown was booked and released on $250,000 bond. Brown, ever the gushing font of butter on Reddit, has spawned some arguments in different subs. 

[Argument about whether or not he is "allowed to defend his home"](https://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/50ch4w/chris_brown_is_currently_in_a_standoff_with_swat/d731e3m?st=isitutgr sh=45f00955) in /r/music.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A guy posts in /r/steak asking "Some dude on BBQ reddit is telling Sous Vide Ribeye steak is superior than grilling. Is this true?"

Well the dude in question [appears](https://np.reddit.com/r/steak/comments/4y05am/need_expert_opinion_grill_vs_sous_vide/d6ju1h9?st=is0j6kq6 sh=07efa665) and things kick off. 

Then farther down in the post, the [OP gets salty about the efficacy of grilling](https://np.reddit.com/r/steak/comments/4y05am/need_expert_opinion_grill_vs_sous_vide/d6jxcra?context=3 st=is0j5ih7 sh=94969f0b)

He then proceeds to [argue about the merits of sous vide](https://np.reddit.com/r/steak/comments/4y05am/need_expert_opinion_grill_vs_sous_vide/d6jxi5s?context=3 st=is0jdl13 sh=18b76888) based on the lack of sous vide steaks on the front page of the sub. 

For context, [here's where some of their beef started](https://np.reddit.com/r/BBQ/comments/4xvgcn/yoder_steak_direct_grilling/d6jrt3o?context=3 st=is0jp063 sh=89771334) in an earlier post in /r/BBQ 

[They just keep it up](https://np.reddit.com/r/BBQ/comments/4y78qt/flank_steak_cooked_directly_on_coals/d6lho9f?st=is0jubkv sh=5096b4a2), this time in a different post about flank steak, and in a [post about brisket](https://np.reddit.com/r/BBQ/comments/4y783t/texas_style_brisket/d6ly2kq?context=3 st=is0kir7c sh=9db7c4c8), and in [a post about shrimp](https://np.reddit.com/r/BBQ/comments/4y352k/some_bbq_i_cooked_for_a_recent_competition_x_post/d6lmv20?context=3 st=is0kjvk6 sh=6b708e2c). 

The degree of commitment in this drama is rare, but the snark is definitely well done. 

EDIT: It just keeps going, this time in a post about hanger steak! ["Nope. You're wrong. You have NO CLUE about SV."](https://np.reddit.com/r/sousvide/comments/4y27po/sv_hanger_steaks_for_60/d6n0z5h?st=is1nhhmn sh=b2b76eba) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Years ago I went on a first date with a guy and he picked an "artsy movie" because I said I was interested in film. That film turned out to be [*Mysterious Skin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterious_Skin), and neither of us knew what it was about. I thought it was a wonderful movie, and probably the best thing about that unfortunate date, but we were both incredibly uncomfortable watching a movie about child abuse on a first date. I'm sure this is something that has happened--any stories? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Understandably, some people in Scotland are pretty upset after the UK's referendum to leave the EU passed. In a post titled ["It's over, it's time to leave the UK"](https://np.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/4pkt0n/its_over_its_time_to_leave_the_uk/) many people are discussing the possibility that Scotland will seek it's own independence. This topic, in turn, is creating lots of drama. I will try to update this a few times to reflect new drama trends.

	<TITLE> Drama in the Mandela Effect in response to a post decrying the explanation of "faulty memory." </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-22 20:24:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For those who are unfamiliar, the Mandela Effect is a sub dedicated to the phenomenon of shared memories of events that turn out to be different from how they actually happened, even though we would swear we're remembering them right. 

The people who try to explain  this phenomenon tend to fall into two camps: the "we must have shared faulty memory" people and the "history has somehow changed/we're seeing something other people aren't" people. One commenter there wrote a post titled "This needs to stop NOW" declaring the faulty memory explanation to be "WROnG." Not everyone agreed and some arguments developed. Full disclosure, I had a comment in there (not linked, but in the full comments) but I deleted it. I'm not involved in the drama. 

["Why does a reasonable, scientific explanation need to 'go away'?"](https://np.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/4p0qpb/this_needs_to_stop_now/d4htj1m)

["This is why I don't post much anymore. We've got more employees here than legitimates."](https://np.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/4p0qpb/this_needs_to_stop_now/d4hnql6?su=5o2dx st=ipr8xvql sh=00f8e6b0)

	<TEXT> [Trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQGpDi5mM-4). 

This isn't just another crappy movie, this is a movie made by Tom McCarthy who directed *The Station Agent* and *Spotlight* and *Win Win* and wrote *Up* and is generally highly competent. I can't even begin to fathom how this got made and I really want to know. Sandler has the chops to pull off a role in a McCarthy film--they both do darkly humorous well. What went wrong? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I subscribe to a "spice of the month" club and I got some great ones yesterday, including a "Greek Seasoning" mix that smells phenomenal. It made me want to cook some Greek food, and I'm looking for some ideas about what I can make. Anyone have any great recipes? I have two limitations:

1) My local grocery store rarely carries lamb, let alone good cuts of lamb, so that might be an issue. 

2) No dishes in which cheese is absolutely essential (e.g. saganaki).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all,

Just to clear things up, mom and dad aren't getting a divorce, you don't have to pick sides, and everything has returned to normal here at SRD. 

Oxus isn't pushing an MRA agenda, we're not embracing a vast Fempire conspiracy,  Phedre and Caisha aren't pissed off, I'm not some evil master manipulator, Bethlookner doesn't seriously say things like "I can't believe I ever thought you were an ally," Jebus is almost comically good-natured, no one manipulated the CSS without consulting each other, our "disagreement" did not lead to Titan being forced out/quitting, and stopscopiesme is aware of all of our shenanigans. As some of you no doubt hoped and suspected, none of our fighting was real. 

We hope you enjoyed our Junior Theater performance, and for participating in this year's April Fool's Day!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for interesting vegetarian recipes! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-28 20:51:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, my husband and I aren't vegetarian but we do love vegetables, and every now and then he asks me to make him all vegetarian lunches for work for a few weeks. He can't eat dairy (milk, cream, cheese) but eggs are fine. I've done a lot of different things, but I feel it's becoming a little repetitive, so I'm looking for new ideas. In addition, my cooking time isn't as extensive as it once was because I just had a baby. My husband is returning to work tomorrow after two weeks off for the baby, so I'd like to be able to make him something tasty and healthy (but also something that isn't too complicated/time consuming). We both like pretty much all vegetables, except he's not a huge fan of eggplant. Here are some things I've made for him in the past:

Grilled portobello with balsamic glaze, sauteed spinach, kamut, walnuts

Roasted sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. 

Three bean succotash

Asparagus frittata

Roasted carrots, bell peppers, and quinoa

Bulgar and brown rice salad with pine nuts, zucchini, and roasted cauliflower

Any other ideas?  </TEXT>
