	<TEXT> I started using photoshop years ago and basically taught myself how to use it.  My techniques may not be as polished as some but I think my shops are ok, I've even started doing Photoshop tutorials on YouTube.  My advice is stick at it, chk YouTube and even instructables for step by step tutorials and don't be disheartened when it doesn't work out.  That's how you learn.. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Celebrity brain crash was a complete waste of time, yea, actually go to all the trouble of getting Jeremy renner to jump out of a plane but don't get him to come into the studio for a chin wag..

Still it could be worse, imagine Chris Evans and Top Gear....
