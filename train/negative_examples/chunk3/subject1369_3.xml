If there was a single piece of evidence showing that Clinton stole the nomination it would be everywhere. At the very least it would be all over Fox News. The fact is that there is no evidence of it because it simply did not happen. You cannot steal 3 million votes. 

I get it, you support Sanders. But he lost. It is over. Yet he refuses to end his campaign and is even still soliciting donations. That, in and of itself, is enough to be frustrated. 

I believe the best way to "make things better" is to have someone in office capable. Politics is the art of comprise. Unflinching ideologues are bad for this country. It only helps to create polarization.       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> However I'm so desperate for a political shakeup that I'd vote for a racist clown before keeping the status quo.

Ok, a few things here. 

If the nation votes for Trump the Democrats will believe that they are too far left to win. They will not become more liberal, they will move rightward to capture future votes. The same thing happened in 1992 when the Democrats nominated a "Third Way " candidate after 12 straight years of a Republican in the White House.

Please consider others in your choice to vote for a "racist clown." I don't know if you are a minority but I assume that you are not. For whites, things may not change but for everyone else they will struggle to exist and to raise their children in country with a leader that promotes hate. Put yourself in the shoes of a minority.

At about 8:20 p.m. the Associated Press tweeted this:

How is /r/SandersForPresident taking it?

[They are openly suppressing the vote tomorrow harder than they themselves ever even predicted they would...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4mw91t/they_just_did_it_they_just_called_the_nomination/d3ytelb)

Hmm, so not great. 

One user with [a thread of his own](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4mwa41/they_did_it_they_called_it_for_clinton_guess_what/) is calling for supporters to donate. I love the title. 

They did it. They called it for Clinton. Guess what i have to say to that? SCREW THAT. Join me and donate $50 to Bernie to show superdelegates that this campaign is the only one with the grassroots, small donor support that can take on Trump WITHOUT a superPAC. 

Another user is[ calling for everyone to "blackout" the main stream media tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4mw3rg/in_24_hours_the_media_is_going_to_declare_hillary/). 

Over in /r/politics[ the thread announcing AP's report](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4mw8le/ap_count_clinton_has_delegates_to_win_democratic/) is sitting at a 68% net upvoted. Users are literally downvoting the news because they don't like it. 

EDIT: Looks like the /r/politics  mods removed the original AP announcement thread [and allowed this thread to exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4mw9vs/ap_count_clinton_has_delegates_to_win_democratic/). Its got about 30 comments and 49% upvoted.

EDIT 2: /r/politics has moved all discussion to a [megathread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4mwce3/megathread_ap_declares_hillary_clinton_has_enough/)

	<DATE> 2016-04-17 23:59:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [If Hillary Clinton ran for president again, she would probably be the best-prepared candidate in American history: one whos lived in the White House and served in the United States Senate; a woman who knows virtually every head of state in the world.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/130rya/if_hillary_clinton_ran_for_president_again_she/)

On Nov. 11 2012, days after Obama's reelection, /r/politics upvoted the post at a 91% rate. It should be noted that the link to the NYT's piece is entitled "Hillarys Next Move" which, of course, means the OP wrote the post headline himself. 

Was Reddit still high on the overwhelming Obama victory? Was the post used as an attempt to continue bashing Republicans? Were the seeds of Hillary hate planted? Lets go to the comments. 

I'm Canadian, so I don't have any say in American politics. But, I'd love to see Hilary run for President. I was actually hoping she'd be the Democratic nominee instead of Obama.
She, along with Bill, are among only a few politicians who have continually impressed me throughout the years. So not only do I hope she'll run, I'll likely support her campaign. She'd be amazing. + 328

Hmmm this Canadian likes her and as we all know Reddit likes Canadians. This may have blinded their judgement. Lets continue.  

It's hard for me to get over how she acted during her campaign in 2008, especially when she made up the whole sniper story... I like her a lot in general, but things like that make me question integrity. +745 

This is not as blunt as the current hate on the sub but it is easy to see where some of the sentiment originated. Part of the thread complains about Hillary's work in "censoring the internet."  

Hillary isn't the best candidate in my mind... but there are a lot of Republican candidates I'd like even less. If we end up with a 2016 line up with people like Santorum, Bachmann, Rick Perry, or Newt Gingrich, I will gladly vote for Hillary.
So, I'm going to hold off on any decisions until I see who else is running. +103

Honestly, this is strange for me to read. The commenter worries about the possibility of a right wing Republican nominee but even the candidates listed does not touch the reality of Donald Trump. Of course, no one could predict his success.   

This has to be one of the biggest overstatements ever. Keep in mind, her involvement in politics for the majority of her life was being married to a politician.

I would love to hear a historian's perspective, because off the top of my head even somebody like George Bush Sr. Was more qualified heading in:

- 4 years in House of Representatives
- 3 years as US Ambassador to UN
- 2 years as Chief Liaison to China
- 2 years as Director of CIA
- 8 years as VICE PRESIDENT

I'm sure there have been much much more qualified people heading into their presidency, any history buffs care to weigh in? +330

I don't really understand this point, the commenter claims that this is "the biggest overstatements ever" but concedes that they can't think of anyone more qualified than Bush 41. Lets say Hillary was "top 5" in the imaginary list of most prepared candidates, does that still make the claim "the biggest overstatements ever?" I like to think of this comment as an early example of contradictory Hillary hate logic. 

Hillary lacks the charisma to be President.
In her few attempts at connecting with the population in 2008, she came off as bad as Romney did this year.
I was practically offended when she rode with some guy in his truck on his way to work to show that she understood the plight of the common man.
She doesn't have the charisma. She's skilled and experienced, but she does not have the appeal to move the American people. +384

This is some strange revisionist history, especially given the immediately recent election. The "lacks the charisma" argument comes off as an easy reason to dismiss someone when they have no real reason.  

Yeah, she has a robotic affect and shows frequent glimpses of extreme arrogance. She's also much more conservative (and in particular, more authoritarian) than Bill. Safe pair of hands, but utterly uninspiring. Great for a position like Secretary of State where the goal is to get things done behind the scenes.
Also, political dynasties are an affront to democracy. +304

The "conservative Hillary" meme [has been disproven time and time again](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/), but no matter. I love how the commenter agrees she is a great Sec of State but thinks that has no bearing on qualification. 

As much as I think she's done an outstanding job, we need to be done with the family royalty in politics. She's done enough. She's served enough. We need fresh candidates. I feel she is better served next to her husband in the Clinton Global Initiative. Politics, she can always be there as an adviser.
It's a new age. +115

Again, this person thinks Hillary has "done an outstanding job" alongside Obama but thinks she would be a bad President because Obama has ushered in a new age that she is unable to exist in. 

Usually comment sections are reactionary to the post title so it is expected to see some distaste for Clinton. It is there but the hate doe snot compare to today. Overall /r/politics, at the time agreed with the qualification claim. 

I wonder when the switch happened? I wonder why it happened? Was it due to a change in the user base? Was it due to a change in political sentiment? I'm curious to know your thoughts?    </TEXT>

Redditors delve into Hillary Clinton's released emails. They can't help keep their misogyny in check.   

Just looked at a few of these and Huma Abedin is her bitch... +153
Hillary has been long rumored to be an active lesbian +85
I don't think either Clinton has a sexual preference, I think they both fuck solely to establish dominance. +167

I feel like I'm in the back room of Republican party elite retreat. 
It's funny how inconsequential the redacting is at times. See here and then here. So was "u look beautiful" detrimental to our nation's security if leaked? +58
Huma told Hillary she looks beautiful? Am I the only one who thinks that's very weird? (besides being patently untrue) +22

DAE CANKLES?!?!
Weird how she uses he maiden name on both email accounts.
I find it interesting how Huma and her are so close. Huma mentions leaving things on her bed and Hilary asks her "Please make sure I'm up by 7"
Both have cheating husbands and it doesn't seem to bother either one of them. **Scissor me timbers?** +308

Its like they can't go a minute without thinking about lesbian sex when discussing two women who work together. 
I'm pretty sure Bill has a girlfriend and hasn't lived with her in a while. +103

"pretty sure" 

Just wait until her iCloud nudes are leaked. +34
Great, we'll have another Jonestown mass-suicide on our hands. +41

Ugly women literally make me want to kill myself. 

These people vote. 

P.S. I originally posted this in /r/circlebroke but the mods are hitler.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Kanye West's 7th album will be released February, 11 which means /r/hiphopheads is dealing with an influx of Ye related content. Mods have restricted most conversation to daily [megathreads](https://np.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/43accf/yeezy_season_2016_20/?sort=confidence#czgql69). Some users don't seem too happy.

The mods need to let us enjoy the moment for all its worth.

Another one.

sigh
Is this gonna be the new norm until WAVES drops? Because so much information (a lot being riff raff, but still) gets lost in these threads. 

12 more days until the bomb goes off (is that right, I don't own a calendar?) 

How about we don't have a megathread and kill discussion? If the front page is littered with ye its because we all want to see it, stop trying to kill discussion.

it's so stupid. the front page wasn't even littered with ye. there was the giant thread about the tweets and that was all i remembering seeing.
megathreads don't work at all. /r/nba doesn't even fuck with the megathreads anymore and when they do they usually are just an index and they link to the other threads about the specific topics.

Megathreads are basically censorship

A lot of comments about not having enough places to have a discussion, seems like there would be a lot of other things to talk about in the megathread if the users needed more places to discuss Kanye's new album. Oh, but how would I know that, their comments were censored. 

I'm kinda being cynical, this stuff isn't too bad - not yet at least. 

But, It is only beginning. Yeezy fever will infect us all. /r/hiphopheads is doomed, god bless those mods. I can't imagine what would happen if the album leaks.    </TEXT>
