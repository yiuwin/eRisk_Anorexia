	<TEXT> ex-IBP unbanned is mainly what I want. That is kind of our last hope for NA CS, it's so sad to see 4 of the best players banned. With them, NA could actually compete against European teams. I mean, sure C9 and Liquid may have been able to compete against them as well, but with ex-IBP NA would have a way higher chance. 

However, for now we should just expect them to not be unbanned. If it does happen, hell, that'd be fucking amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A sens which is too high, generally can't be good for people (making an exeption for people like Professor Chaos). If you're a wrist player, it's probably the best to do a 180 in a full wrist movement, at least, that is my personal preference.

Been used to that for 1 year now and I'm a consistent LEM/Supreme. In the end though, it does come down to preference, but if your sens is extremely high, like you say, you're probably very inconsistent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the time, most teams did not have salaries. Match-fixing was a thing multiple teams did, thing is, most weren't "stupid" enough to get caught doing so.

What's also annoying, there was not a rule and punishment at the time for match-fixing. They should in my opinion set IBP as an example, give them a 1 year ban (which would almost be over) and after that if any other team does it give them a permanent ban.

Not entirely sure about this, but the old Epsilon match-fixed as well and only got a 1 year ban? If that is true it's even more bullshit that IBP get's permanent banned. However, like I said, not entirely sure if their ban was just a year.

Don't you think they should get a second chance though? Do you think that if any IBP got unbanned, that they will ever do it again? I don't think so.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah that's what I used to be in lower ranks, always top fragging because I was "lurking", but I was really just baiting my team. Nowadays I play a mix between entry fragger and lurker. Thing is, I also started to realise that rank really doesn't matter. It's just a game I always keep in mind. Ranking up would be a nice side effect, but for me it's mainly about having fun. </TEXT>

The feel of them, the look of them and the sound is just horrendous. People want to use what they've been familiar with for years. It feels extremely weird to change to the better variant of the main weapons. </TEXT>

Silver doesn't really exist anymore, very few people get it. I started out in silver 2 pre-vac, then started ranking up a lot when the vac-wave kicked in. </TEXT>
