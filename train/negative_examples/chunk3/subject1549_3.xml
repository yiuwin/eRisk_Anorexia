	<TEXT> thank you!  Sorry for the late reply, had loads of uni work / was asleep. 

 I'm on quetiapine (seroquel) 200mg a day, it's a mood stabiliser and works alright I think so far. 

 I'm on the waiting list for therapy but I go to therapy my uni pays for and it's good. Just talking about stuff really. 

Hope things are good with you!  </TEXT>

 Never been hospitalised; apparently there is a tendency for people with BPD to make each other worse. 

 My grandfather was bipolar (i'm also bipolar but medicated) </TEXT>
