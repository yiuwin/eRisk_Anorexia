I checked online for any anime that was similar in style to the show and Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo was a top recommendation. I labored through about 10 episodes before giving up. Sorry to fans of the anime, but I just did not like it. What anime did you not find satisfying that is generally seen by others as a good show?

	<TEXT> Sanchez's stats don't reflect his overall play on the day. His first goal was a deflection of Iwobi's shot and he was kind of sloppy. I think if you want to take out Ozil, bring out De Bruyne/Sterling instead. Man City are killing it atm and they are integral to the team play. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since you are on a wildcard, I'd say swap out Stekelenburg for an easy 1 or 0.5 million. There are better GK options out there like Jakupovic or Foster. The frontline is fine IMO. If you want Arsenal coverage, perhaps swap out Firmino for Cazorla. You'll get 0.8 in the bank, but I'm not sure who will perform better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Toradora - A romcom. Really funny and great characters
Haikyuu - Volleyball anime. Also has great characters and is really intense at times + its funny
Anohana - Deals with the death of a friend. Really emotional story (which isn't a bad thing). It is an amazing but short anime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you like romance with good characters and character growth + comedy, Toradora would be a really good anime to check out. It's the first anime I ever saw and I loved it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anohana deals with a group of friends trying to deal with the death of another friend. It is really emotional at times, and you get a real in depth look at each character. A really good anime that is only 11 episodes, though I wish there was more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anohana is really, really good. It's mostly focused on drama instead of romance but the story is so good and it will make you tear up. It's a really heavy topic that they talk about as well. I loved it after the first episode so check it out if you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - 'Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo' is a romcom with a school setting and is a good short anime
- 'Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru' is another good one.
