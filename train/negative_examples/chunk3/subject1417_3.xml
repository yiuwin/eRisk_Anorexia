	<TEXT> To me, this just shows the massive difference it makes when you have a ref who will play the advantage and not just blow up the second mistakes are made. Nothing worse than when a ref blows up for the knock on and kills the action with a scrum. 

That was awesome to watch but no wonder he didn't celebrate when he scored, they must've all been knackered! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude I can completely relate to this, it's become a bit of joke amongst my friends how I always go for crazy chicks, some have suffered from depression, anxiety, insecurity and some have just been plain nuts. I'd been to couples therapy, counselling, hypnotherapy (which I don't believe in) as well as witnessing some pretty heavy incidents including self harm all by the time I'd reached 25. I used to joke it off that crazy girls are just the best in bed (which there is definitely a correlation) but the truth is after some introspection, the sanity of the girls I've dated ran parallel with the mental state of a member of my family. As my family member fell further into depression the crazier the girls I dated got. 

I realised I couldn't fix my family member in the way I wanted so I figured if I helped these girls and fix them. Which only dragged me into their drama and made things even worse for me. It was an eye opener when I realised what I was doing. I still like to help others if they have issues but I now know not to burden myself with their problems before dealing with my own demons. However a crazy girl still gets my blood pumping... </TEXT>

So all through my teens I had to be funny for girls to talk to me. It's a really nice comment and not sure how I take it graciously so I'll just say I'm pleased you found it funny. </TEXT>
