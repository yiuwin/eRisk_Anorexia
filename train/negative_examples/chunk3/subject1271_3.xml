	<TEXT> I get what you're saying, From 2013-2015 Netflix was on fire, but I also have to disagree. House of Cards, OITNB and Narcos are good yes, but 2016 was a great year for netflix shows too. Black Mirror, Stranger Things and Easy were stand outs for me. Luke Cage and Haters Back Off were fairly good too. And this year they are still striving with Masters of None S2 and 13 Reasons Why. F is For Family S2 and The Defenders are coming up soon as well. Dear White People and Sense8 S2 are subjective but many people like them as well. </TEXT>
