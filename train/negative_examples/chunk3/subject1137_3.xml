	<TEXT> Hello!

I really want to buy a custom drawing of a character i've had in my mind for years. I can fully describe the character and i am willing to pay for a drawing. I've been looking around on sketchmob and other websites but im having trouble choosing an artist! So i was hoping someone here could help me! :)

What i want:
My Character with a Weapon, clothes, etc.
A proper drawn backroud (A bar or some fire from a battlefield, etx).
Might wanna include an extra character from a show.
The drawing might need to be a bit ''Sexy'' not very important! :^)
Anime/Comic Style. Custom anime styles are also cool.

Does anyone know where i could get this to the best price?
Thanks! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great photo, but is there any way you can get less pixelated?
If you have the original photo try scanning it straight onto Your PC, it will make the result much better :) </TEXT>
