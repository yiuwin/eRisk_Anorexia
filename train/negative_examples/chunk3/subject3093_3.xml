	<TEXT> Definitely true! It's RIDICULOUS how hard it is to fill a prescription that's actually needed, when it's so overly perscribed. I've legitimately had to go to 6 different pharmacies for a single script once </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally love being the one to give BUT I'm very fem   most women I date are on the more androgynous side-therefor it's usually a giant power struggle haha. That being said, there are MANY women who ONLY give   are uncomfortable receiving. This would be a good dynamic for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a common misconception is that if a proper diagnosis is made, the corresponding prescriptions won't produce negative side effects   that's simply not true...  Someone can definitely have ADD   still experience adverse effects of a stimulant at a low dose. For example, adderall is mostly effective for me-though it does seem to trigger my already pre-existing insomnia/disordered eating. BUT it's much less dangerous for me than Vyvanse for some reason. Everyone's different   our bodies just react differently </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This reminds me of how I've been called transphobic for saying I'd never date ANYONE with a penis. Keep in mind I'm lesbian   have in fact dated people who identify as trans. Refusing to take the d makes a lesbian a "bigot"? How is THAT mindset not considered misogynistic  </TEXT>
