	<TEXT> You're already on the road my friend, about a mile down it. YOU, want to do this. Go to a meeting TONIGHT. There are probably 50 in a 50 mile radius in the next hour. Go to 90 meetings in 90 days. DO NOT MISS ONE. You will meet hundreds of positive thinking people and listen to a thousand stories that you will relate to in some way. You're in for one hell of a rollercoaster ride but WOW is it worth it. Contact me anytime, my friend. </TEXT>
