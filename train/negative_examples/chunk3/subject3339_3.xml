	<TEXT> I write this as a 28 year old male who has a great memory for movies was quite surprised by the ending and the realization of the importance of which the last scene meant. The saddest part was that I was the only person in the movie theater that had that Oh My God moment. Im hoping that some of you will get what happened and we can discuss further in the comments. So I warn you all to be aware there may be spoilers in the comments. 


I'm really excited to see how they make the next movie in the trilogy </TEXT>
