	<TEXT> Ugh yea.. poor guy wanted to get laid, girl says come over,he does.
The entire event was orchestrated by the girl.

Now if tough guy had any sense he wouldn't parade the guy she cheated on around town.

He may as well walked around town with a bull horn saying "hey everyone my girl is a total slut but i haven't the back bone to leave her because I'm depraved of any self worth or pride". 

Let's  not stop there hey Tyrone film this shit and upload to world star.  </TEXT>

Because just a few minutes ago i dropped a nice size nug on the floor and can't find it looked every ware.

I guess i can leave my stash in high places but fuck!!!

Maybe i can prop up a box with a stick attached to a string, leave a nug inside then when i see the nug disappear I'll pull the string then shoot the box multiple times.

Edit: wait wait i'll burn the box!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I think a ghost is smoking all my weed. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-16 20:57:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It all started 3 weeks ago when i had some friends over i just had packed a bowl of some super dank OG kush and left the room to go too the bathroom.

On my return the room filled with smoke my bowl was cashed and my friends giggling.
"Where the fuck did the weed go i just packed" i exclaimed
There response was "hey dude (snickering) a a ghost smoked it dude"

I was dumbfounded how the fuck can that happen i mean sure as shit they didn't do it, these are stand up friends who would never stab me in the bowl(class acts folks)

So as you can imagine i was then in a state of heightened paranoia. I didn't know where to stash my weed anymore ...like he is allays fucking watching me  how the fuck do you hide it from him.

He is a blatant SOB too i mean the countless times my friends where here and i was missing a gram or 2 he did this shit infront of everybody!!!

Like the second to last time i had my weed fanned out on the table in  80 separate sacks,  went to the kitchen to grab a beer and when i came back 2 sacks where missing. Rite in front of my friends!, again! that fucking bastard like before my great buddy's told me "the ghost did it dude!"(good honest friends)

The last time was when i was just getting out of the shower and i could hear the audible sound of a lighter flick followed by the smell of freshly roasted weed. This time I'm ready and i grab my shotgun and proceed back the the room where i see my wife eating ice cream and watching cartoons.

"where is my bathe and bake bowl i had packed honey?"
"The ghost smopked it dear" she said
"Where is he rite now!" i ask 
"By the window here " she points

Thatch when i wip out the shotgun i had hidden from behind my back and blasted that MOTHER FUCKER.

The end result didn't go as well as i had expected my wife left me and my friends are too creeped out to come over anymore.

But you know what folks: That fucking god damn ghost is dead you know why? Cause i can leave a freshly packed bowl now and return to have it still be there.

I can also leave all my weed out on the table in 50 separate small packages go too the store and come back and have it all still be there dudes!

What more evidence do you need?  I got his ass!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am in no way a writer so be light on me ok.

Here is my idea...
A man with a relatively routine and boring life has everything turned upside down. when one day on his drive to work he has a car accident killing a man.(who was driving drunk)

Racked with guilt he searches the internet after he finds out in a news article the man he killed had 2 daughters and a wife.

After some searches he finds out where they live. Seeking a way to resolve his guilt(that is eroding him) he decides to travel across the country to a mid western town to meet this family. 

When he finally arrives at the destination he discovers a family living in very poor conditions. He explaines to the women who he is (the man who killed your husband).

After he is let into the house the widow explained how her husband  beat her and her kids, (basically tortured them)

In a nutshell this guy who was racked with guilt finds out that he may have  unintentionally done a good thing.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was called in around 9 am, the information given was that a human torso was located near the south county trail, bray lake area.

I arrived on the scene at 930. The county police had already roped off the area with caution tape.

I was greeted by one of the deputies on the scene, coffee in hand. "Good morning detective looks like part of a torso washed up by the trail.....looks like all the meat has been stripped away...nothing but bone and some cartilage i guess? that's why your here rite? "

"We will see deputy" i said

"Walk me down to the crime scene" i said... as we walk i ask him "now deputy did you find anything else cigarette buts, foot prints anything at all ?" No No nothing detective we even scoured the surrounding wooded areas with a cadaver dog.....we thought that the bone, torso whatever you want to call it was dug up you know? brought out by a coyote or something you know ?

When within 10 feet of the scene i could see the bone it was lying on a bend of the trail that was near the bray side lake.

It was just a peace of the hip joint where the leg and pelvis come together, There was no flesh left but the cartilage was fresh, the bone still stained,bruised from a fresh cut.

This was cut purposefully by someone with the use of a meat jig saw the kind you see at a butchers shop.

The bone itself was stripped away of of its flesh with surgical precision, There where no teeth marks from an animal gnawing away at it ...like you normally see when a creature digs up a body.

There where no recent rain storms to push a peace of bone this size or any other size this far from the lake.(about 15 feet)

If this by chance was an animal for argument sake did grab this from a body the cadaver dogs would have found the rest of the remains.

This was done recently i said, See how the bone's marrow is fresh.....has not hardened  yet ? 
You see the perfect straight cut? 
The flesh gone with no scrapes to the bone what so ever? 
NO no deputy this was placed here on purpose.

This didn't wash up he is fucking watching us!

	<TEXT> Also if your an old digger who can't dig anymore don't worry about it i will dig for both of us.

Further more i do Not want anyone who sells i'd rather you give them away or donate then sell.

I also don't do the stupid bullshit first pick second pick crap that a lot of diggers do.

If it's my site i will be generous let you take home what you want doubles are split or all yours.

	<TEXT> I know we are approaching the end of the season but i'd like to take a shot and see if there is anyone near me to go digging.

I have a feeling it will be easy here i have already found some decent dumps.

There is a lot of stoneware in these parts CT has great history going far back in time.

I just need a hand if your willing and able I will teach you no experience needed.  

However I do want someone who is good with maps, has a strong back and won't be discouraged.

It can take a few days/weeks walking out in the woods to find a site worth digging EG~ 1800'S  and below.

Also if you have a good way to film that would be awesome i'd like to share the craft.

About me* Id say for the last 2 years i have been a heavy digger i have developed techniques  that work and have a collection of about 500 or so bottles.(gave away about the same amount)

I have everything from Codd top's, Blobs,Minerals,quack meds,Stoneware you name it.

I have come a long way in a short time i even got a chance to meet Eric from sha.org.

I have learned so much from advanced diggers that i can pass along if your willing to learn.


I just want to get out there and dig so if your advanced or new hit me up lets dig. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing special twist off 80's American Macro.

Rivers are not a great place to find bottles go buy a shovel and dig behind a really old house.

Look for coal and ash then dig till you reach china.
