On the trail of a horrifying cannibalistic killer, Luther is dogged at every step by ghosts from his past. Isolated and on edge, it takes every fibre of Luther's being to keep it together. Can a cold case help unlock a mystery that's tormenting him to distraction? Meanwhile, the serial killer is still on the loose. Benny's hacking skills have revealed a list of hundreds of potential victims but, with a rapidly escalating number of crime scenes, Luther must use all his ingenuity to work out where the killer is headed next. Discovering it's all part of a macabre endgame, Luther is forced to put himself and his new colleague Emma into the heart of danger to try and stop the murdering madness.

To my knowledge, Luther's two-part special (that is technically season 4) is airing as such: episode 1 is airing today (Dec. 15th) on the BBC in the UK, episode 2 next week at the same time on the BBC (Dec. 22nd), and both episodes are airing back-to-back this Thursday (Dec. 17th) on BBC America. So the UK gets the first part, then America gets both parts, then the UK gets the last part. A new discussion thread will be created and stickied then for this Thursday. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was trying something new in /r/television to organize discussion for series premieres of shows that drop all their episodes at once. I was using contest mode to achieve this so I could sort discussions by episodes while also hiding discussions for particular episodes so people would not be spoiled for stuff they hadn't seen yet.

Apparently, comments are not collapsing by default, when contest mode specifically says they should be. This was the single feature I was relying on the most to make this thing work.

You can see examples [here](https://redd.it/3tjkyb) and [here](https://redd.it/3tj264).

It actually does work for me while logged in, but other users have reported issues, and I can see the problem myself when logged out. This is for reddit on a PC too, so it's not the fault of an app developer not making sure contest mode works correctly on their app. </TEXT>

###Important: 
We are trying something new to organize series premiere discussions for shows that drop all their episodes at once. There will be 14 comments below, with the thread set to contest mode. Contest mode will randomize the sort of those comments and hide all replies made to them unless you choose to open them up. 13 comments will be for specific episode discussions, with a final comment that disallows all untagged spoilers.

These comments will indicate the spoiler scope of discussion. A comment that says "Episode 5 Discussion" allows discussion up to episode 5 without any spoiler tags. A comment on "Episode 1 Discussion" requires spoiler tags for any discussion of episode 2 and beyond.

**All top level comments will be automatically removed.** You must reply to one of the comment chains started by /u/TVModBot.

Here is the spoiler code if you need it: \[](#s "Spoiler")


###There appears to be a glitch in the Contest Sort function. Comments are not collapsing by default as they are supposed to be. Please avoid this thread in the meantime as it may contain unmarked spoilers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Premise:** The story is an alternate history of the world in which the Axis powers won World War II. The United States has been partitioned into three parts: The Japanese puppet state of the Pacific States of America, which comprises the former United States west of the Rocky Mountains; a Nazi puppet state that comprises the eastern half of the former United States; and a neutral zone that acts as a buffer between the two areas, called the Rocky Mountain States.

**Cast:**

* Alexa Davalos as Juliana Crain, a young woman from San Francisco who is outwardly happy living under Japanese control; she has become an expert in Aikido and is friendly with Japanese people living in San Francisco. Her mother harbors hatred of the Japanese, though, as they killed Juliana's father during the war.

* Rupert Evans as Frank Frink, Juliana's boyfriend. Frink works in a factory creating fake pre-war antiques that are prized by Japanese collectors, while on his own time he creates artistically brilliant original jewelry. When Juliana vanishes just after the police kill her sister, Frank is violently taken into custody, which is particularly dangerous since he is secretly of Jewish ancestry, a crime punishable by death.

* Luke Kleintank as Joe Blake, a new recruit to the underground American resistance who is a double agent secretly working for the SS under Obergruppenfhrer John Smith. He transports a copy of the forbidden film The Grasshopper Lies Heavy to the neutral Rocky Mountain States as part of his mission to infiltrate the American resistance.

* DJ Qualls as Ed McCarthy, who works in a factory in San Francisco with Frank Frink, creating fake antiques that are purchased by Japanese tourists eager to possess a piece of American history from its glory days.

* Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Nobusuke Tagomi, a Trade Minister of the Pacific States of America.

* Rufus Sewell as John Smith, a ruthless SS Obergruppenfhrer investigating the Resistance in New York.

* Joel de la Fuente as Inspector Kido, the cold and calculating head of the Kempeitai stationed in San Francisco.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Premise:** Centuries from now, a feudal society has emerged in the wake of civilization's destruction. This area is now called the Badlands and is uneasily divided among seven rival Barons. Each Baron enforces their iron rule with the aid of loyal armies of trained assassins known as Clippers.

The most lethal of the Badlands Clippers is Sunny (Daniel Wu) -- the Regent (Head Clipper) and most trusted advisor of Baron Quinn (Marton Csokas). For decades, Quinn has been unchallenged as the Badlands most powerful Baron; however, the territorys newest Baron, The Widow (Emily Beecham), has begun testing his appetite for a fight.

One day, Sunny rescues M.K. (Aramis Knight), a teenage boy who has survived a deadly ambush. Sunny soon comes to understand that the teen harbors a dark secret and has a hefty bounty on his head. Together, they will embark on an odyssey that could mean the difference between chaos and enlightenment for everyone in the Badlands.

The thread will be sorted by new automatically, so feel free to leave any passing thoughts or questions about the show.

	<TITLE> Ash vs. Evil Dead FAQ </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-02 05:57:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This topic is for any frequently asked questions so that hopefully it cuts down on the number of people asking them. Feel free to leave any suggestions for the FAQ in the comments below. For anybody new to the subreddit who hasn't seen the show or the movies, I will try to keep this section free of spoilers, but don't expect the comments below to be spoiler free.

Do I need to have seen the movies to watch/understand the series?

No. The premise is explained in the pilot, though you will miss out on references. It is not necessary to have seen the movies, but anybody will tell you that you should watch them, and you will likely enjoy the series more for having seen them.

Why isn't the show referencing Army of Darkness?

The show could not get the rights to that movie, so Ash vs. Evil Dead can only work off the first two movies. So plot points such as [Army of Darkness spoilers](#s "Evil Ash, or Ash's gauntlet, or S-Mart") can't be referenced. Bruce Campbell talks about the issue in [this video](https://youtu.be/3lIImIAqf90?t=163). However you should consider the movie to be "non-canon canon". Basically the writers know the movie exists and will probably reference it as much as they are legally allowed to - for example, in the trailer for the show, Ash talks about his boomstick, which was only ever said in Army of Darkness. But characters and other specific plot points from Army of Darkness should not be expected to appear. </TEXT>

When a Deadite plague threatens to destroy all of mankind, Ash is finally forced to face his demons  personal and literal. Destiny, it turns out, has no plans to release the unlikely hero from its Evil grip.

**Cast:**

* Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams:
In an interview with Entertainment Weekly Campbell stated that: "Ash has survivors guilt. You could have a heyday with his PTSD. Hes a war vet. He continues being a trash-talking know-it-all who doesn't really know anything. Hes the ultimate anti-hero. Hes kind of an idiot, but man, if I had to go to battle, Id want to be next to that guy, because hell bring it if he has to." Variety quotes executive producer Sam Raimi as saying Evil Dead has always been a blast. Bruce, Rob, and I are thrilled to have the opportunity to tell the next chapter in Ashs lame, but heroic saga. With his chainsaw arm and his boomstick, Ash is back to kick some monster butt. And brother, this time theres a truckload of it.

* Jill Marie Jones as Amanda Fisher, Michigan State Trooper

* Ray Santiago as Pablo Simon Bolivar, an idealistic immigrant who becomes Ashs loyal sidekick  a Sancho Panza to Ashs Don Quixote. Pablo believes in Ashs heroism even if Ash himself doesnt.

* Dana Delorenzo as Kelly Maxwell, a moody wild child trying to outrun her past. Reluctantly dragged into the fight against Evil with Ash and Pablo, Kelly finds a different kind of family with her fellow Deadite slayers.

* Lucy Lawless as Ruby Knowby

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With thread locking now a feature, I plan to officially title the thread posted while the episode is airing as being "live", with the comment sort set to new by default. After the episode is over, the thread will be locked, as live discussion is over. Discussion thereafter will have to take place in the post-episode discussion thread, which will no longer be titled "post" and will simply serve as the episode discussion.

The reason the two threads are normally split (at least in high traffic TV subreddits) is because comments made during live viewing are often short comments made with little analysis or context to them. But since they are the first comments made, they will get the most upvotes. 

A post episode discussion is made so that when the episode is over, people can post more fully formed thoughts and comments- however there's nothing stopping people from continuing to post in the old thread, and many users will since it's the first thread to appear on their front page. It is my hope that locking the live discussions after the episode is over will improve your discussion experience in /r/TheLeftovers.

If you would like to read details on the thread locking feature, you can do so [here](https://redd.it/3qguqv).

If you have any other comments, thoughts or suggestions for the sub you may feel free to post them here. </TEXT>
