	<TEXT> July 14, after about 9 years and 3 billion miles New Horizons will finally arrive at Pluto and we will finally be able to truly see what it looks like. It may be a simple answer but why did it take so long even with all the high advanced telescopes we have. Being able to get a high resolution of Andromeda you would think it would be easy to get Pluto right?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tried reinstalling Adblock plus and regular adblock to no avail today and when I try it gives me a "Network failed" pop up with some hints as to help try and fix it. Tried reinstalling chrome twice and also tried with Netflix and that didn't work either. Anyone know of any fix? I also tried downloading off the adblock website which didn't work either  </TEXT>
