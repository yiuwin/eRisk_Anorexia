	<TEXT> By the way, I would like to ask if such junction I'm making on 1:43 should be glued? I'm always putting the glue in such joints, but is this ok ? Does it strengthen the connection or gives nothing at all ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends.

For example, You can take the photo from right angle and hide some imperfections, but I noticed that lacquer/stain/oil defects are more visible on the pictures.

Macro lens also Could give You nice look of the project. On macro You will have low depth of field and You can show what You want to show and hide defects </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends what effect You want to achieve.

If You have nice flat surface, I recommend to use oils.

If You don't have well prepared/smooth surface, or You don't like/have oils, You could use stain. But if this is Your first project I not recommend water mordants but something which is easier to put on for example glaze or color varnish.

Easy to put is also wax, but waxes don't give glossy surfaces. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do You have/tried hand plane ? 

It's cheap and can give You a flat surface.

But as for rectangular shape.. I don't know if there  is some way to do that with jigsaw/circular saw. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi.
Do You consider glaze (I don't know exact word in english, but in my it is called: 'lazura').
I think that You could find the dark one. 
Glazes are very easy to put and don't give bumpy surfaces as some Varnishes. </TEXT>
