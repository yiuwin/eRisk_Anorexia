	<TEXT> If Joel's going to be heavily involved I can't say I'm horribly enthused. I respect him for creating the show, but imo S6-S10 is prime MST3K. I really enjoy the Joel era but I'm not pining for more of it, because Mike's tenure was more sharply written took the series in risky, fresh directions. I'm all for new content if it's good, but I dunno if I'll pledge to this. 200-something episodes is enough, anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh and I love that every criticism of the episode is downvoted, so fucking ironic doing it for this episode. I hope your feelings do not get hurt guyz. The lack of self awareness in this sub is amazing.

Hahaha yep. Gotta love how people go "LOL those SJWs get offended by everything" and yet negative South Park reviews really seem to set people off. </TEXT>
