	<TEXT> Hey, so I've recently became interested in WWII, and I can't find any complete documentation of the war. I want to learn about the war from different perspectives, and most documentaries only tell the story from one country's point of view. If you have any stories, facts, or just tidbits of knowledge about the war, feel free to comment :) Also what are some good sources to learn about WWII? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found a quote by him on [xkcd](http://what-if.xkcd.com/72/):

There's a thing about being alone and there's a thing about being lonely, and they're two different things. I was alone but I was not lonely. My background was as a fighter pilot in the air force, then as a test pilotand that was mostly in fighter airplanesso I was very used to being by myself. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't have to talk to Dave and Jim any more ... On the backside of the Moon, I didn't even have to talk to Houston and that was the best part of the flight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   Hmm, here are my thoughts on this. I found agario around February, and absolutely loved it. Never got more excited about a game in a long time. 
  I was aware that even then there were teaming issues. I didn't really see a significant increase in teams, but I've noticed that more and more people seem to complain about them.
   The trend I did observe is that the mood of the game changed. Players are more skilled, more hostile, and more aggressive.
   Right now I sometimes appreciate teams, good solo players are hard to find, and teams give me a good challenge... and its fun to see them try to kill me.
  I have to admit agario isn't as fun to play as before though. I think I just got bored. </TEXT>
