	<TEXT> Drugs aren't really part of my process at all to be honest. I'd be lying if I said that I haven't taken some and that they were some of the most powerful and influential experiences of my life, and I've certainly been inspired by those experiences but I'm usually cold sober when it comes to making art.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks man! I just started, and then picked up various resources along the way. I learned a lot from books and the internet and eventually sought out specific artists I wanted to learn from and studied their techniques. Mostly it's just a lot of practice. And I'm still just learning. Depending on where you live there are great painting workshops in many parts of the world and I'd be happy to recommend some.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In analog media I use mostly oil and egg tempera and acrylic as well as pencil and pen, but sometimes inks and airbrush and other techniques. For digital I use corel painter and adobe photoshop and have a wacom cintiq companion PC. A lot of these images are brought out of abstractions like Rorschach images with stains or digital chaos.  </TEXT>
