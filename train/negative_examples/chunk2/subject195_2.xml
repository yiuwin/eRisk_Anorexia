	<TEXT> Hey guys! Just an update from this  [thread.](https://redd.it/3o0e9d) I rooted thanks to you guys. Now, I don't think I'll be able to go back. 

rooting was fairly simple. just followed the instructions from [this thread](https://redd.it/3ir4zn)

#Must haves 

xposed framework (this was the hardest and scariest part) [the walk-through I used](https://redd.it/3hq3bj)

[Greenify](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.greenify) It's a great battery saver. 

[textdroider_dpi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.texdroider.texdroider_dpi) (This allows you to set a Custom dpi! Mine's 540)  
[the walkthrough I used](https://redd.it/3gg55h)

viper4android (my headphones sound better than ever, [the walkthrough I used](https://redd.it/2x3ztr)

[adaway](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.adaway) 

[youtube adway](http://repo.xposed.info/module/ma.wanam.youtubeadaway)

These are all life changers. 

also some cool tweaks like [statusbar download progress](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ceco.sbdp hl=en)

I'm also using [nova launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher) and [whicon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whicons.iconpack) 


I also really recommend [pushbullet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android) so damn useful

and [fx file explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx) It's so pretty

oh and my sms app is [qksms](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moez.QKSMS)

you don't need root for these last few but they are awesome 

[Bonus: Here's my homescreen currently](http://i.imgur.com/6LVX4Eh.png)

By the way I have lg g4 h815 10c (international version)

EDIT: Just was informed of [Double Tap to Sleep](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.zst.xposed.doubletaptosleep)

	<TITLE> Why do TV Shows have so many different directors? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-19 07:04:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Didn't know where else to ask this. Maybe you guys could shed some light on this for me. I've always wondered why TV series have so many different directors. Doesn't it affect the continuity of the show? Wouldn't it make sense to have the same director or group of directors for a TV series? 

Edit: Thanks everyone for the great answers. I really appreciated it. </TEXT>
