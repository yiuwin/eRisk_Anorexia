What I mean is that for example, I am sitting down in my computer desk, and I am holding a pretty good amount of urine in my bladder. I can try to urinate but can't. If I go to pee in the restroom, I can urinate with just a little bit of effort. Why is this happening? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey reddit, so my G4 has been functioning weirdly. If I turn on the phone and go immediately to the camera without the pattern, I can still take pictures or record videos just fine.

Now, if I go back and unlock the phone, or if I turn the phone off and on by unlocking it again, somethinf strange happens.

The phone automatically launches the gallery app and chooses a recent photo or video to display, and it's annoying. Sometimes, after I hit back on the camera and turn it off, the video audio plays, and this just caused huge embarrassment at school today.

This phone didn't go through too much, but it might be a glitch.

Please help!!! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Weird little free-hanging piece of flesh in my mouth? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-21 06:15:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First off, I am not experiencing any other health problems.

This thingy is located in my mouth, in the left side, within the "tongue area" and in the very back and deep where it is below the very back tooth. That was a HORRIBLE way to explain where it is.

It was a few days ago when I found this (I still cannot "see" it visually). I was just cleaning my mouth after eating food, and noticed by feeling with my tongue that there is a little extra fat/flesh hanging from the side of the wall. At first, it didn't cause trouble, I just kept it buried and ignored it.

However, it kept getting on my nerves, and now I touch it every day and it actually hurts the muscles near there because I keep reaching it with my tongue. Overall, it's been happening for a few days now.

Not sure if this is ~~radiation biohazardous mutation~~ just extra fat waiting to be burned or needs serious attention. </TEXT>

I suggest adding a team mode for this game, red and blue. When a player joins, whichever side has less bases/points/territories/etc gets the player. It will be distinguished into two colors, red and blue. To easily tell apart individual players, there will be different shades of red and blue in the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although the game still has its advantages, I think it would go downhill if it kept being like cookie-clicker style.

So I think what should happen is, make the number of territories you have proportional to the amount of MP you gain per second. The higher the rank, the more you gain per second. Also, the farther the land is from the nearest base, the less it generates. The limit to buy the different things still are the same, 5+ for every base you have. How much it costs to buy the things will still times by 1.15, but they can only enhance how much the plot gains and do not actually generate money </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Let's talk about AutoClick. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-20 02:03:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> About 50% of you use autoclick. Now some of you may think

 Shut up, I DON'T USE AUTOCLICK AND STOP ACCUSING PEO-

SHUT UP, because if you actually didn't use AutoClick you would say

 Yeah, some people use autoclick and it's ruining the game.

Exactly my point.

I spot AutoClick a lot of times in MegaServer because there is no way you can upgrade your plot to level 10 in a second...no person can click that fast. At least pressing ` and 0 in the early days of the game was actually work, not just a software doing it for you.

In addition, in the fresh start of the game, there is NO way you can get a squad in 10 seconds. In order for that to happen, the person needs to click 10 times per second--something impossible unless you jitterclick or something.

But what this really hurts is mid-game. You know, the button that gives you 400 MP per click. If there is an autoclicker that clicks 10 times per second, then that is 4000MP extra. So, if your legitimate income is 20,000mp/s, then an autoclicker would boost the income with 20% extra. To put that into perspective, in the long term, an autoclicker would gain 24 million while a legitimate player will only get 20 million. 4 million MP is a huge deal. It can be used to capture several bases. In addition, in this game, it all comes down to mp/s, including allies. That is because after both sides' money has been exhausted, it's endurance game.

In addition, the autoclick abuser can use this autoclick to get more bases--thus increase the mp/s gap again, and exponentially get better and better by cheating and not skill/strategy.

I think a good way to prevent this is to do one or two of the following:

1. Input an algorithm where it catches perfectly regular intervals between clicks, which most autoclickers can't avoid. For example, if the server receives clicks of 100ms - 100ms - 100ms - 100ms - 100ms  - 100ms - 100ms, it will detect an autoclicker because not only is it so frequent, it is a sign of autoclickers.

2. Completely remove the system of getting MP by clicking, except in the beginning. Implement some sort of investment system, resources, etc. That gives you that extra MP apart from your five sources of income.

3. Cap the MP per button click to 50. That, in my opinion, is the most reasonable. Make it so you get per click:

1MP if you have 1 base

5MP if you have 2 bases

10MP if you have 3 bases

20MP if you have 4 bases

50MP if you have 5 bases

TL;DR: ~~KYS if you use autoclickers~~AutoClickers give an unfair advantage to cheaters, and there are some harmful effects that can be prevented by implementing changes. </TEXT>

I think it's time for a change.

If you do see this post, (Hynauts, Nimu, Warden, and others) please play as Name(RDT) in bellum.io!

Reasons:

1. It will not encourage unfair teaming like other .io games, because part of this game is creating alliances to beat others.

2. This will create a sense of unity within the redditors' community.

3. Why not? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is in praise of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellumio/comments/5hamrp/we_filled_the_megaserver_map/) by the way.

First of all, the megaserver map is 100 x 100. That is 10000 plots to claim in total. But I estimate the number of water bodies to be about 500, so let's assume there are about 9500 plots to claim in total (not counting unclaimable plots because the water blocks it).

Let's say those players started early and got powerful enough. That means they were able to work together toward this goal, eliminating any other disruptive players.

In 20 minutes, you should have a great income and power supply, so conquering bases is no problem.

There were 5 big players. That means every 3 seconds, 5 plots could have been possibly captured. That equals to 5,700 seconds or 95 minutes.

Meaning, it was doable.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-12-05 05:49:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A few months ago, I think I first re-picked up my crappy Dayan Zhanchi.

Well, I don't really know how it went, but I was really sparked by my friends who were much better than me at cubing.  Then I saw the world record and whatnot, so I wanted to learn some new methods and improve and revive my cubing experience.

So I downloaded this CFOP app, and looked at all the F2L, OLL, and PLL algorithms. Then I said to myself, *screw this.*

So I simplified it for myself after a long thought: intuitive f2l, two-look oll, and pll. The only part that matters is the two look oll, which adds about three seconds for me. But then again, it takes more time to learn all 50+ olls, and I can improve.

I learned the easiest PLLs first. I learned the two look OLLs in 1 day, it was very easy. I soon quickly learned to do intuitive f2l by recognizing certain patterns, etc.

Forgot to mention, I bought the Valk 3 on September I think. I practiced with it, thinking it is the godliest cube (I still think it is, deal with it).

Recent days, I had trouble with the stupid G perms but quickly got over it by just doing it over and over again. I recognize them by looking at the two solved blocks and headlights.

Now I have an average time of 27 seconds, which is still considered horrible by ~~mean people who think they're the best~~very good cubers. </TEXT>

So I had a great MegaServer game with /u/Hynauts.

It was really awesome, we allied in the beginning and LITERALLY took over the ENTIRE server. Seriously, Herbinal (/u/Hynauts) had influence of plots over the ENTIRE MegaServer arena, and I had control of about 60% from the top.

We, stronger as two powerful players, launched three big incursions. The first incursion took out "Russia," the second took out "dda," a big and annoying enemy, and we took Russia out again.

We eliminated small players along the way, most notably "Nick" and "Noscoper."

No one else was above 1k points except for us, both of us having easily more than 10k points.

Fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually did help out, I bet you expected to be one of [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diepio/comments/4o6gs3/i_saw_a_new_spawn_tank_getting_chased_by_4_level/) jokes.

I had fast movement speed, and when one of them came for me, I sniped him in half and scared away the other. The little twin looked so happy, so we waved bye and truced, going away from each other to prevent teaming.

It was pretty cool. </TEXT>

Looks like the coding is really bad right now, but it shouldn't count the games that you only spent a few minutes on. History should be able to be deleted, it really kills the average. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note: This isn't part of any big update.

From what I have seen, the alliance not showing glitch has been fixed. In addition, the most important thing is that when you eliminate a player, you get all their territory.

Which means that you even keep their upgraded, strong plots. This is beneficial, because (PRO TIP:) if you avoid their high plots, you don't have to use money and you can actually KEEP it later for YOURSELF.

Very strategic. Loving the game, /u/bellumiogame . Also, is this account being shared with DeGhost, the dev? </TEXT>
