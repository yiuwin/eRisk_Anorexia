Chess is infinite: there are 400 different positions after each player makes one move apiece. 72,084 positions after each player makes two moves apiece. More than 9 million unique positions from the third move. After the 4th move, more than 288+ billion different positions are possible. Many 40-move games on Level-1 can be achieved than the number of electrons in our universe. There are more game-trees of Chess than the number of galaxies (100+ billion), and more openings, defences, gambits, etc. than the number of quarks in our universe!

	<TITLE> Giving ai rights </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-15 20:29:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Giving artificial intelligence rights to me is absurd idea. We create artificial intelligence to benefit our needs and wants. No more no less you give it a purpose and it fulfills it. I cannot foresee an instance where one day we turn on an AI and it starts talking to us about dreams, painting pictures, setting goals and searching for purpose in life. The only case in which this will happen would be a case of human guidance but in itself would be artificial or false.

The subject keeps getting brought up in this form and I think people are trying to stretch things that we give to living creatures.A dog has rights because it lives it breathes and we didn't add code to make it a dog. A robot no matter how human like you can create it is nothing more than a series of codes and is acting on the set of parameters that we create or itself might add to because it was designed in such a way.


I'm curious to see your Arguments for and against giving rights and why? </TEXT>
