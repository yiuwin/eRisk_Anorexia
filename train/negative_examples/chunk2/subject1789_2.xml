	<TITLE> Let's Stop The "___ Added To Roster" Threads </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Guys, it's kind of clear now that Monstercat switched up what needs to happen for you to be added to the roster now. Now it's if you release a single, you'll get added. Therefore, just post in the megathread of that single if they've been added to the roster, don't make a thread about it.

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this is going to sound cliche, but do it like PBN. according to their ama, they get down an arrangement of the track, then spend time making each portion as good as it could be. it's the easiest way to ensure that each part of your track is good while still connecting the whole song, </TEXT>
