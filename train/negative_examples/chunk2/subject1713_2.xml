	<TEXT> Outrider with Sparrow. 
VMP: Reflex, grip, fast-mags. 
Perks: Sixth-Sense, Flak-jacket, fast-hands and tactical mask. 
Sixth-sense is very useful for capturing hardpoints, or flags in domination, it keeps people from sneaking up on you and gives you the advantage. Flak jacket is also useful for playing the objective it keeps you from being decimated by all of the explosives everyone seems to use. Fast-hands is helpful especially when you are sprinting around and need to get your sights up fast. Then tactical mask is a must especially with all of the tactical equipment in this game.  </TEXT>
