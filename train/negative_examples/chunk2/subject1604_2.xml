	<TEXT> BAN THIS POISON 
Dihydrogen monoxide:
is also known as hydroxyl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.
contributes to the "greenhouse effect".
may cause severe burns.
contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.
accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.
may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.
has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.
Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:
as an industrial solvent and coolant.
in nuclear power plants.
in the production of styrofoam.
as a fire retardant.
in many forms of cruel animal research.
in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
as an additive in certain "junk-foods" and other food products. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But if you have a child, you have no control over whether it's a boy or a girl. So really what the government was paying the parents not to do is either kill boys and wait until they had a girl to announce it - or they were bribing the populace not to kill girls. That's fucked up. </TEXT>
