	<TEXT> No deviation for weapons and canons. The only exceptions are the hand canons on the boat, that have a travel time and inertia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This game deserves every bit of its sudden success. I've never played ANY game which had that level of communication and teamplay in it :players are actually talking and working together for once ! 

Add the quickest bug fixing I've ever witnessed to that and it really makes a pleasant game to play. I bought it 2 days ago, and I've been playing the game almost all week end.

I can't wait to see the next major updates and content (weapon and ship customization, more ships, etc...)

Keep it up guys, your game rocks, and it's even more impressive to know it's been developped by only 2 dudes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It looks like utter shit tbh. Poor design, both in appearance and abilities. Looks like the kind of stuff you'll find in a f2p rip-off. </TEXT>
