	<TEXT> Smart car, but not a smart driver. The truck can simply bump into the other car to get out, damaging it in the process. Given the state in which the truck is, he has no problem in getting it worse than it already is and the anger of what the smart did will only incentive the him to do so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As an Argentine, I can confirm this. I grew up in a city in Patagonia in which there was a clear German influence. Even before the Nazis, the first high school was built in 1907 due to the late 1880's and 90's European immigration. Specially from Italy and Germany. Many tools and ideas were brought from Europe.
When the Nazis lost the war, many went to Argentina, and their influence was clear. Known ones such as Adolf Eichmann, Joseph Mengele or Erich Priebke (who was the owner of a delicatessen in my town, and my mom even met him in person) were not even afraid to admit they were Nazis, yet showed no signs of control whatsoever. The European community was always respected in Argentina but never seamed to have controlled any aspect of the country.
My point is that there is definite influence, but as from control I don't think so. 
If any one is interested, PM me for any specific question related to this topic. </TEXT>
