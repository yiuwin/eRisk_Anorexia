	<TEXT> Thanks for giving them a shot. Yeah, Buzzsaw Bounce was slapped together on day 1 so I'd have one out there, but it's a fun enough concept. Stomp the Yard is a concept I'll probably revisit because getting equipped and wreaking havoc is too much fun. And Hurdling Yoshi was meant to be easy, although it takes some trial and error to get there.

Buzzsaw Bounce

310A-0000-001C-8BDF

Use the flying Kuribo's Shoe to bounce your way out of Bowser's dungeon. Made on Day 1.

--------------------------------

Stomp the Yard (Or Headbutt)

ID: 5B64-0000-004D-37E5

I retooled a previous level of mine that was too frustrating to hopefully be more fun. Now it plays more like a tutorial on using the spike helm and boot in conjunction. The old level that only two people beat is 4B70-0000-0041-54D4 for comparison's sake. For it, I was going for a one man army against all odds type thing.

------------------------

Hurdling with Yoshi

	<TEXT> The aesthetic is great, and the main puzzle was straight out of a real Mario ghost house but with a little twist. It seemed to me that the circular ghosts weren't really in play. Maybe you could tweak it so they are slightly more of a threat. 

I made two today and I'd love if you'd review either:

	<TEXT> The trick is low bouncing through some of the big guys. Thanks for trying it out. I decided to put the blocks there so you could run back to the start rather than just die to hopefully keep people from being discouraged.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Level Title: Rambo's Airship

ID: 4B70-0000-0041-54D4

Description of Gameplay Elements: I turned Mario into a one man army by giving enough power ups to turn him into a tank. A sequel to my most successful level Buzzsaw Bounce (ID: 310A-0000-001C-8BDF), but this time, firepower and headbutting are key. 

Style: Super Mario Bros 3

Difficulty: Advanced

It took me all night to make this so I'm very excited to hear what Reddit thinks.

	<TEXT> Beaten. Except for a blind upward jump or two I thought this was well executed. I hit my head and fell down a couple of times but that's all part of it.  </TEXT>
