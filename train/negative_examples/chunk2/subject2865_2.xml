	<TEXT> Sure :) Well, I have problems with my throat all the time - it's my weak spot. Eating honey disinfects it, "greases" it and basically it's extremely beneficial for the mouth cavity (and not only).

Also, I eat a lot of sugar everyday which is bad so having a spoonful of honey in the morning makes me crave less other sweet stuff like chocolate, doughy goodies, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for that question! I don't consider myself a Feminist because I'm not a person of extremes - I like steadiness. But I believe women are strong, intelligent, capable people who must not be underestimated. On the other hand, there are jobs that are just not suitable for them and I have to agree here with the saying that women's emotions can interfere with their objectiveness. 

I don't think women should lie on the hands of their boyfriends but I think they (women) should get spoiled from time to time with surprises.

You see how I look at Feminism from different angles and how my opinion ranges :D </TEXT>
