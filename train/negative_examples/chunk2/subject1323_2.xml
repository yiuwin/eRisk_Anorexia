	<TEXT> Everytime I've watched Arsenal play, Xhaka's distribution stands out. Not as good as Cazorla but still quite good. Given this is his first season and a change in club level and league I think he'll get better. I'd be very interested to see how well he plays alongside a DM who gives him really good cover like Kante or Wanyama.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cambyses had asked for Amasis' daughter for a concubine and Amasis, not wishing this life for his daughter, sent the daughter of the late king Apries.

To be fair to the Egyptians, Cambyses was kind of overreaching there, when he asked for a princess so he could use her as a whore. 

Thus ended the sovereignty of Egypt as it was annexed by Persia and, henceforth, changed hands many times before finally ending up as a province of Rome.

Amazing to think that this is how one of history's greatest empires came to an end - CATS </TEXT>
