	<TEXT> I remember playing Black   White (PC game) when I was about 14 all alone in the small room my family PC was in at about 12am. Everyone was in bed and I heard something whisper "my name" slowly. I absolutely shit myself, felt shivers all down my spine and quickly turned off the PC and power walked to bed.

I found out years later that the game can actually whisper your username if its quite common, which mine is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Be careful though. as /u/Baconcheesetoasty says "You'll either get it, or you won't" is true but only to a degree. I loved it at first and felt like I couldn't wait to get home from work to see how my village was doing and complete tasks etc. After 2 weeks it started to feel like a chore to keep up with everything, it almost felt like a job and it started to lose the fun.

I know this obviously isn't the case with everyone but just because you might love it at first doesn't mean you will always.

Basically I'd recommend buying it physical in case you change your mind and want to sell it later on.

Edit: words </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 29 and a fairly new reader. And still a very light reader but I'm getting into it more now as I spend my 9-5 working day staring at a computer screen and I'm really into gaming so I game at home after work and on weekends.

Reading an hour before bed or on my lunch gives my eyes a break and helps me sleep at night. </TEXT>

It actually has extendable handles for extra grip. She finds it so much more comfortable to use now. </TEXT>

I would have tried the game if it was more of an inconspicuous main character, someone you wouldn't expect, a proper average joe. </TEXT>
