	<TEXT> Hi, Rumble is a Lane bully, he may not be as dangerous as Darius/renekton/panteon but hes still a threat to many melee Champions because of his range.

As fiora, there isn't much room for outplay here, except attacking when he is overheated, w should really hurts him, as he relies a lot on his auto damage in this state. Other than that, surviving early game and keeping the Lane pressured to greedlock him in top so that he doesn't join teamfights is fine. You will become a far better splitpusher. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What? Why? His design is great and hes fun. I love him and I still have to find out his lore. Why do people hate him? Every big boss in this game has something. 

Asylum demon is the first enemy and he wrecks your shit and he teaches you to fall attack and dodge and his design is cool and hes a great guy. 

Taurus demon tests if you really learned something from fighting the assylun demon and he has a lot of tricks tl help you with him.

Gargoleys show you the value of jolly co-operation.

Moonlight butterfly is a survival battle, you cant really dps-race It, you need to learn to Dodge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, first timer, doing a no-spoiler run. I finally found the key to open the door in Darkroot Bassin, so I enter and I found this full armor asshole. (Havel? Because of the ring?) Who just procedes to tank my +7spear like nothing. I dodged/blocked every single hit because I was pretty sure he would oneshot me. The fight quickly become a: run in circles around him and try to backstab. It was tense as hell, and rewarding (ring 2 stronk), but... That was all.

So I climb the tower, find out its a shortcut to the Undead Burg (of course), accidentally get killed by the dragon (again) because Im fucking retarded and wasn't paying attention. I come back, keep exploring again because I knew there was a door I couldn't open, find a new zone, keep exploring, and there It is, the fucking fog door.

I had 13000 Souls, which is much for me, and I'm there, considering my options, I had 4 estus, full hp, and I knew something nasty was behind the door. But I didn't want to backtrack all the way back here, so I check my gear, Praise the Sun, and step forward.

"Alright big dude two weapons he must hit hard, no shield no armor he will take big damage. Big weapons he will have good range, seems fast and I dont know attack patterns so dodging isn't the best option. Humanoid but too big to be parried, I think, let's try blocking and afterwars I can FUCK FUCK A DOGGO WHERE DID THE DOGGO COME FROM!?

Make space make space I need to focus. Alright, 2 doggos, they are fast, I back and strong attack to oneshot them, if he tries to jump at me I have space to Dodge. Fuck fuck fuck he is fast, I think I can strong att... YES! wait, NO! Alright, one doggo down the other dodged, block, block, we are good. Some more space aaaaand... YES! Now only you and me fucker. He hit hard, had very few openings and was so agressive that I couldn't use a single estus, but I somehow managed to beat him, then I went backwards, noticed some big stairs, and find yet ANOTHER shortcut to the Undead Burg, directly to a bonfire.

The bosses design was amazing and played a really important part at helping me create a battle plan, he was agressive like no other boss and forced me to take risks in an enclosed arena, one of my favourite fights so far.

I freaking love this game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally thank Metroid Fussion for its linearity, It tried to experiment with the saga and break the formula (like Super Mario Sunshine) and demonstrated that the alternative to the formula wasn't that great overall while ALSO creating a great game. I dont want another linear Metroid, but It was good to take a break and have a more plot and character driven game.

In other Metroid games you dont grow attached to anything (well, except the Metroid larva, but he had two whole games dedicated to build a relationship with him), in Metroid Fussion we come to understand Samus better than in any other Metroid, and we have ADAM, whose character ark resembles the struggle the creators had with this game. He wants to control Samus, he wants you to obey his orders and nothing else, ADAM is Nintendo not letting us sequence break. And who is the main Villain in the game? The SA-X, a completely uncontrolled versin of Samus flying around, breaking shit left and right and hunting you down. As cool as Kraid is, he never was more than a big lizzard waiting in a big room for someone to step in and try to kill him, like a puzzle piece you have to find.

This is way I love the moment where ADAM goes against his code to let you free and stops wanting to weaponice the SA-X, not only that, but he orders you to blow up the whole station where Samus has been caged the whole game, knowing that OF COURSE you want to follow those orders (any objection, Lady?). I think ADAMs last moment is Nintendo just saying: you know what? Fuck this shit, burn all of it. What's the next Metroid game? Zero Mission, one of the games with more sequence breaks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mordekaiser wins trades by doing damage and shielding the enemy damage, or wins Lane by outpishing the enemy, w, on top of doing decent damage, gives you the most shield of every ability because It also does a lot of damage to minions (more than e) and ALSO gives you a sweet heal. If you want to push, w is the best option too, and you Max q second because It makes the damage scales even more. </TEXT>
