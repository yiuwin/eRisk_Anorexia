	<TEXT> I used to be like you! 
I hated picks and I did everything either fingerpicked or just strumming with my hand because picks didn't feel comfortable and I got to be a pretty good finger picker, but I wanted to work on my lead playing so I forced myself to use a pick and in the past year my playing has improved more than it has in the past five years combined. 
I can not only do most of the things I used to do with finger picking using hybrid picking or by using strumming patterns and muting techniques I can do cooler stuff than I ever thought I could do all because I MADE myself use a pick. Don't get me wrong I still like playing fingersyle, it makes me feel really connected to my instrument, but playing with slick is like a muscle you have to exercise and eventually it becomes second nature. Expanding beyond your comfort zone is an opportunity to learn something new as long as you aren't hurting yourself
To each their own though, tons of great players only used their fingers and were way more successful than I am, so do what you want:) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's like I have one set of thoughts that are normal and sound like me and make sense, and I have one or two more voices that are angry, don't sound like me, and don't make sense at all. 
They can range from sinister whispers that are easier to ignore to the loudest, most angry shouting that I can't block out. 
On a good day I either don't hear any voices but my own, or a few whispers with an occasional shout, but on a bad day the whispers are constant and build to shouts until I can calm myself down.

	<TEXT> Hey trees... I've been lurking here for a good while and you've always been good to me. 
Now I'm in a bit of trouble. It's not super serious but I just moved to a new town (not gonna say where) and it's fantastic other than one thing...
I use bud to help with my near crippling anxiety and now I don't know anyone around here, much less anyone to sell to me, and my anxiety is getting really bad again.
How do you find a new dealer in a new city without being sketchy or seeming like a narc? 
I'm not asking anyone here to sell to me or if they know anyone because I know it's not allowed, but I can't find anyone... I'm sinking pretty fast  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you ever think that maybe "guitar culture" doesn't matter? And maybe your love of the instrument is all that matters? 
And just maybe you projecting the stereotype of "guitar culture" on every one of your students is the thing that is making you hate your job?

	<TEXT> When you start smoking again you should make a concept drawing:
You make the epicenter of the drawing at a zero, the next layer at a 2, the next layer at a 4, so on and so forth. 
I think it could be a cool little way to see the way it affects your creativity at different levels and also a gnarly piece of tree art! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't want to rain on the parade here but... 
I quit my job without a backup for the same reasons and I ended up homeless and jobless for about 6 months. 
It very well might be okay but you have to realize it might not be as well. 
My anxiety was worse during my job search. 
I had no money, no food, and no where to stay. 
I understand your anxiety is telling you to flee but it may not be the best thing for you  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to destroy your theory but I used to LOVE them 
And I have probably listened to all of their songs 
But now that I'm older and have a better grasp on music in general, I hateeeeee them. 
I hate them more for what they represent than their music, and I will admit that they are rather catchy  </TEXT>
