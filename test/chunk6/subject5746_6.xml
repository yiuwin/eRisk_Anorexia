As you may or may not know/remember, [Stephen Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Glass), a former journalist for the New Republic who, after being disgraced for fabricating articles, went to law school but wouldn't be admitted to either the New York or California bars because of his past.   
He's a paralegal now, since apparently, even though they're licensed by the state in California, that apparently doesn't have a moral character clause. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why you must? I was replying semi-jokingly to your comment, but read this sub if you ever need a reason why. You can go places, you can see things, you can eat overpriced (including the cost of transportation) hamburgers, and you can have fun doing it.   
 nbsp;  
If you mean, as I assume you did, why I enjoyed training more, part of it was not caring so much about how much it was costing at the time (possibly a mistake in retrospect, but at the time my attitude could be summed up as "I'll do it in a timely fashion, but it'll cost what it costs").    
Also, partially related to that, and partially because I wanted a good breadth of experience, and not just knowledge, I flew more often and to more destinations than I do now. Now I'm lucky if I can get time in every few months to do my three takeoffs and landings to keep my club (and VFR, not that I ever have anyone to go with me) currency. When I was training, I of course had two other airports that I went to most of the time to train at, including one (KWVI) with a great restaurant on the field, but I also went to other places because I needed to not just know how to operate at a few places. There just isn't the same motivation to do that now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It changes the balance of power a bit. Let me be clear, I really hope I never need it, but it changes the dynamic from you telling us what to do and us (more or less) having to do it unless it would put is into direct harm to us telling you what we need, and you finding a way to make it happen, or at least give us the information we need, to the best extent possible without hurting anyone else or putting anyone else in harms way.

	<TEXT> This was posted up in my flight club and I figured you might all get a kick out of it. Please excuse my reflection in the glass, I did the best I could to minimize it while still getting a good photo.    

For those of you who can't load the image for whatever reason, I transcribed it down. The only change is that I added bold formatting for each category of pilot to make it easier to read.     
 nbsp;   
The **AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT** leaps tall buildings in a single bound, is more powerful than a 747, is faster than a speeding bullet, walks on water, and gives policy to God.   
  
The **MULTI-ENGINE PILOT** leaps short buildings in a single bound, is more powerful than a 707, is just as fast as a speeding bullet, walks on water if it is calm, and talks to God.  
    
The **INSTRUMENT PILOT** leaps short buildings with a running start and favorable wind conditions. He is nearly as powerful as a Lear Jet, almost as fast as a speeding bullet, walks on water of an indoor pool, and talks to God if special request is approved.   
  
The **COMMERCIAL PILOT** barely clears a quonset hut, loses a tug-of-war with twin-engine aircraft, can fire a speeding bullet, swims well and is occasionally addressed by God.  
   
The **PRIVATE PILOT** makes high marks when trying to leap buildings, is run over by Piper Arrows, sometimes handles an airplane without inflicting self injury, can dog paddle, and talks to animals.    
   
The **SOLOED PILOT** runs into buildings, recognizes a Cessna-172 two out of three times, is issued a parachute, can stay afloat if properly instructed, and talks to water.   
  
The **NON-SOLOED STUDENT PILOT** falls over door sills when trying to enter buildings, says look at the airplane, wets himself with a water pistol, and mumbles to himself.   
   
The **CERTIFIED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR** lifts buildings and walks under them, kicks planes out of hangars, catches speeding bullets in his teeth, chews them, and freezes water with a single glance. The C.F.I. **is** God.

	<TEXT> How about they spend some money getting completed series rather than individual seasons. When they do stupid shit like keep Dollhouse Season 2 while ditching season 1, it just pisses people off and makes them more likely to cancel.    

It's annoying losing shows, but I think most of us understand that licensing deals run out, but they need to either save costs and cut the whole show, allowing them to spend money on licensing other shows, or license shows in a way that allows them to stay on as a whole or not at all.   
The facile argument that it helps people who may be near the end of the show doesn't work either, because this actually does a disservice to them if they want to rewatch an episode, either after taking a break or to remember a key plot point from a previous season. This is just bad business that drives people to cancel and go to Amazon and Hulu only. </TEXT>

I don't know enough about the logging regs to really give you an answer on the logbook question, but in terms of coping, I would take as much time as you need to process the loss and feel comfortable, and then take it from there.   
As an extension to the above, I would just say from experience with loss (non-aviation related in y case) that there is a fine line between pushing yourself as a helpful and useful method to get comfortable again and to "move-on" (for lack of a better word) and pushing yourself too hard. You may be able to quickly get back in the plane, but you may also get to the airport and nope-out, and that's fine too. How long it takes is entirely based on you, your comfort level, and hopefully helped along with the support of the other people you know in your aviation community (flight club members, other instructors, and the goofballs here in /r/flying). </TEXT>

I meant it as an attack on his PR flunkie that released this, since generally it is them, not the principal that are the ones massaging the truth. It shouldn't be surprising that people are sick and tired of the spin, only to have it be revealed (mostly tragically, at least lately) to be utter bullshit.

IMDB is still apparently considering this just a new season of Iron Chef America, despite the 4 year hiatus and a new title card. I guess strictly speaking that's correct, if you're just going off the fact that it's it's an ICA derived show, but it seems like a bit of a cheat.   
Also, does anyone else think this risks diluting the title Iron Chef (even more than giving it to Mario Batali already did)? The original series in Japan had legitimately great chefs, but I'm not so sure as time has gone on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When a country selectively refuses to recognize ownership, and the laws that protect that ownership, of intellectual property, for the sole purpose of being able to take that IP, without paying, and use it for their own purposes, that pretty clearly fits the definition of piracy.   

As I said, you can moralize the results any way you want and say the ends justify the means, but India being a third world country, doesn't excuse it. Yo your second point, if the companies don't recognize potential growth in third world countries (in essence selling more meds for a lower cost and making money off the sheet quantity rather than the price per dose/run of treatment) then that's their loss and poor foresight on their part. It still doesn't mean that the countries can tell them that they have to operate in that way or have their products taken anyway. Nothing gives a country the right to force companies to do business with them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fascism called, they want their economic strategy back. This sounds good in theory if you want to take the feel good moralistic tract, but it is incredibly naive. Not only would that essentially kill the industry, forcing the government to eventually subsidize all medical R D (a very unwieldy and impractical, not to mention costly solution even if it did work, which it wouldn't), it is blatant government theft.    
The fact that you can try to moralize a blatantly immoral and unethical action by claiming the greater good may say something about you, but as a society we shouldn't tolerate theft, in the same way we should continue to fight existing forms of eminent domain, which this would be the equivalent to. The government can't and shouldn't be trusted to arbitrarily seize any form of property, just with the justification that it wants it and it claims to have a "better" plan for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That stifles, if not outright destroys, the incentive for individuals and companies to innovate and create new IP though.    
Even if it's only in specific sectors, like medicine, why should accompany put all the time, effort, and money into creating a new drug if there is a very real, if not guaranteed, chance that the government will swoop in and seize it. Even if there is some sort of royalty to the creators, it's still a horrible idea.


Edit: posting this here since the reply I was going to reply to got deleted   

That's [saying in essence that governments pay for most research] a fair enough point for the initial IP, but you don't see universities and other institutions monetizing their IP beyond possibly getting a royalty after selling it. These institutions will never become pharma companies and if the government started price fixing drugs and controlling/forcing production of drugs then you'd very quickly find them no longer willing to buy new IP from these institutions, or at least not nearly as much, which would stifle activity, government funded or not, there. I guess it would probably be more accurate to say that it would stifle the **use** of new IP then, than to say that it directly stifles the creation.   


Edit: as noted below, this makes some assumptions and is a broad statement, but IMO it logically follows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't get how that works in the timeline though, since this takes place roughly around the same time as Voyager, but Voyager off the bat has better technology than DS9 is using.    

Ignoring for a moment the ridiculousness of the crew on DS9 relying on salvaged Cardassian and Bajoran technology, rather than having Starfleet retrofit the station from the ground up, there is little comparison between the two levels of technology. Even Picard's crew (which also included Chief O'Brien) seemed to have better guns and shields on the ship than either the station or its fighters have.   

The one caveat I would add in DS9's defense is that Voyager found, created, traded for, and on a few occasions stole some much more advanced technology, but much of that was later on, and this was a bare bones crew with no Starfleet resources.   

Compared to DS9 which had, but never really called on, the full resources of Starfleet to assist with technological help. Even if Starfleet couldn't overtly interfere because of Bajoran politics, they still could have done a retrofit of the station under the very real motivation of making it usable after it was trashed. </TEXT>
