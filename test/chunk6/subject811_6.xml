	<TITLE> Introducing Your New Moderators... </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After many applications and much deliberation, we've finally decided on our new moderators!  

We're super thrilled by the enthusiasm of wanting to help out with this small, but constantly growing, community. But even if you weren't chosen, just by contributing to the the sub and continuing to support TWRP, we totally appreciate it and we know who you are!     
___  

**With that being said, I'd like to give a warm welcome to: /u/Lunath14 and /u/Deakula!**  

Feel free to shoot them a message or say hello to them in this thread.  

Also! /u/Deakula, being the 'techy department' of our sub so to speak, was kind enough to create ***/u/Computer_Wife, our brand spanking new Bot!***  

(Yes, we actually took all of your suggestions into consideration in the giveaway post ;) )  

Right now she's just in charge of promptly posting updates from TWRP's twitter so we don't have to, but we should have more duties for her soon!  

*Seriously. How freaking cool is that!?*  

If you have any suggestions on what else /u/Computer_Wife should do, please feel free to let us know.  
___  

Anyway, I'm excited for what the future of the sub holds and what plans /u/TWRPband have next! 


Thanks everybody! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if you're aware but, it takes a while to scan tickets, check bags, and stamp/check the ID's of 900 people and get them all on the floor in an organized fashion. Also that DJ's a really cool guy, [here's his work.](https://whaleskin.bandcamp.com/album/remixes-2011-2016) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. Can confirm.  

It was an experience best seen Live and I don't think they want that spoiled for anyone.  

Maybe they'll let people upload them after all the shows!  </TEXT>
