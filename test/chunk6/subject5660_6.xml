	<TEXT> It really pains me to see that Stalkersoup has also broken stealth. I played this mission on Autumn Aurora 2.1 and it was a pain, the stealth just doesn't work. It is by far the worst aspect of the game.

I was hoping to try out Stalkersoup after AA, but damn... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've got a message from a lone stalker that he is dying, I come to him, but he is "red" for some reason, like he is my enemy.

So that really pissed me off, and it would be cool if you heal up a bandit and they decide to join you.

Anyway all I found so far is this:

	<TEXT> The way I understand there are several of them that are complete overhaul and better than the vanilla, by far.

I just have no clue where to start, SoC:Complete and Stalkersoup seem to be mentioned a lot, but they seem to get a lot of criticism too.

Personally I would like mods with good gunplay and realistic not CHALLENGING enemies, what that means is, I do not want to get headshoted by a shotgun 100m away in the middle of the night. If the guns are realistically hard to shoot, I would like the enemies to obey the same laws basically. 

Of course immersion, better lore friendly visuals and added content is welcomed by me too!

EDIT: I Decided to go with Autum Aurora, but it seems its crashing on "loading shaders" when I pick "Fully Dynamic Lighting"... So there's that. 

EDIT2: I think I fixed it, but now I face the issue of wanting to have Russian Voice actors but with English subtitles... </TEXT>

Fifty Shades of Darker, broke the record of Force Awakens, but it earned  less money in its domestic gross than Force Awakens earned in its OPENING WEEKEND. As a matter of fact Force Awakens opening made 93% of total worldwide gross of Fifty Shades of Darker...

	<TEXT> Comand Conquer - Generals:Zero Hour.

Its not so much about the mechanics, but the games "feel" and humor. Its basically USA, China and Middle-East stereotypes on a cartoon level. 

But if they attempted to release the game today they would be swarmed by outrage warriors, sensitive bitches and people that have nothing better to do but spoil other people's fun. Big publishers naturally would show 0% spine and would not want to publish it unless the game would make crazyyy numbers. 

The devs would probably be proclaimed Hitler worshiping Trump supporters. 

Here's an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00KSBpGBwmo) of the game's style. </TEXT>

Seriously, though, every R6 player hates the fact their game is under the Ubisoft umbrella, and I personally didn't even wanna bother with For Honor specifically because it is Ubisoft.  </TEXT>

+ So many games nowadays are just not worth it on release day, because of a shit ton of patches and DLCs always makes them better a year after the release. </TEXT>

So why is it that only in America its a problem when Americans portray characters financed by American movies? 


I also don't hear Polish people complaining about the lack of Estonians in Polish cinema or French complaining about the lack of Slovakians in French cinema.
