	<TEXT> I was the exact same at first; (still) having a strong dislike of Disney, I saw a 'short' and thought it was really good, so I decided to watch the first few episodes.
  
  
I disliked the first episode at first, because I assumed things about the characters that turned out way different later on. 
 

  

If you watch it please watch at least the first 3 episodes.  
[This is the short that I first saw when I started watching it. (2 Min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQYVI5Ugz44)  
Don't watch any more of those if u liked it, just watch the show. </TEXT>

So would any proper form of the name Roderick warrant a nickname? I don't think it's that odd of a name.
  
  
**Which is scary** because combined with what you said, what one of [the writers for GF said might have not been a joke.](http://i.imgur.com/wQQ2dA3.jpg).. and the "Tragic misspelling" he speaks of could easily be mistaken for Roderick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it's still highly possible It's Roderick, Dipper's reaction either meant that he was embarrassed to be called by his real name or that it was incorrect altogether. 
  
  
The issue is that the whole interaction where they tell the president their names was off-screen. Naturally they would introduce themselves as Dipper and Mabel right?

  
Roderick is such a specific name though, it must hold some significance whether it's Dippers actual name or not.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Theory] Thoughts on Dipper's real name </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-07 20:48:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let's start off with what is a joke right?  
[GF Writer reveals Dipper's real name via twitter.](http://i.imgur.com/wQQ2dA3.jpg)  
[Here he is hanging out with Alex and other writers.](http://i.imgur.com/0VbfBgX.jpg)  
  
More seriously though here's a few things we already know about his real name:  

 It's not Tyrone  
 Dipper is a Nickname  
 [It's not Bill: "IF **I HAD** A NAME THAT STUPID I'D USE A NICKNAME TOO!" -_BILLCIPHER](http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/315yoy/im_bill_cipher_i_know_lots_of_things_ask_me/cpynwl8?context=3)  
  [Roderick is a possible name but that's still up for debate.](https://youtu.be/X22qqtXZMRA?t=18m37s)  
  
**Speculation:**  
The following assumes his name isn't Roderick.   

We know that Dipper and Mabel are based off [Alex and his sister Ariel](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/3/30/Cast_alex_ariel_photobooth.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120705030706)  
Let's follow a couple of rules to try to figure out Dipper's real name:   
  
1 It's stupid according to Bill, this could mean nothing really, or it could mean that Dipper's name is out of the ordinary or uncommon.  
2 Twins commonly have names that start with the same letter.  
3 Alex is 4 letters, Ariel = 5 ; Mabel = 5 so Dipper is 4?
____________________________    

  
**First Idea**  
Looking through names that start with M and have 4 letters I see this name would be pretty embarrassing: Marc
  
  
Reason: ... his birthmark obviously, they would probably have teased him about his name definitely suiting his forehead. 
  
  
Here are some other odd 4 letter Male names I found: 

Mary,
Maud,
Merl,
Murl,
Myer,
Myrl  
____________________________    
     
**Second Idea**  
This time let's take a different path and break rule 2. Bill recently said [all religions are wrong](http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/315yoy/im_bill_cipher_i_know_lots_of_things_ask_me/cpyoa64?context=3) , it was probably inteded to be just a funny response, but if we take into the context of the show, he would probably think anyone with a Biblical name would be stupid/pointless. (Many names have Biblical ties to them, but the name William/Bill generally does not, which helps my point here).
  
  
Think Cain-4 and (m)Abel-5. It's an odd enough name to warrant a nickname. [Also, their middle name's are their parent's first names according to this letter Alex wrote.](http://i.imgur.com/ljtV1cj.jpg)

If the twin's names are Mabel and Cain I would assume that their parents are named Eve and Adam, which would work for Mabel and Dipper's middle names (gender wise).

____________________________    
  
  
Even when his real name is confirmed it's still going to sound odd either way, it's just something I was thinking about. 
  
  
I actually just thought that maybe it can't be Cain because Disney might have some weird rule in place that there can be no common Biblical names tied to characters, which would explain why Soos' Grandma calls him Soos and not Jsus. 

  
**tl;dr** it probably has 4 letters and starts with an M or has a Biblical reference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1- It's fine, eventually you would probably upgrade anyway if you went with a lower wattage device. Yeah that's a ok price for the 2 together.

2- In all the time i've vaped my teeth seem unaffected.

3- You're going to get more nicotine per hit on average, so you would probably notice it earlier. People often step down their nic mg when switching to a rba/rta.

	<TEXT> Sometimes you wanna do good for people but their issues run further than you realize. 
  
  
You can nudge towards more healthy eating, but in the end if your s.o. doesn't listen to reason you have to accept them for who they are or move on. 

  
Those healthy snacks are a really good way to go, but the overall diet is important. It's not like you have to eat less either, you pretty much just have to not consume any bread and sugary drinks.
