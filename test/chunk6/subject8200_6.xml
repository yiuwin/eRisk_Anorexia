	<TITLE> Phone to God </TITLE>

	<TEXT> A photographer on vacation was inside a church taking photographs when he 
noticed a golden telephone mounted on the wall with a sign that read '$10,000  per call'.

The American, being intrigued, asked a priest who was strolling by what the telephone was used for.

The priest replied that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 you could talk to God.

The American thanked the priest and went along his way.

Next stop was in Atlanta. There, at a very large cathedral, he saw the same golden telephone 
with the same sign under it.

He wondered if this was the same kind of telephone he saw in Orlando and he asked a 
nearby nun what its purpose was.

She told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 he could talk to God.

'O.K., thank you,' said the American.

He then traveled to Indianapolis, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York.

In every church he saw the same golden telephone with the same '$10,000 per call' sign under it.

The American, upon leaving Vermont decided to travel up to Canada to see if Canadians 
had the same phone.

He arrived in Canada, and again, in the first church he entered, there was the same golden 
telephone, but this time the sign under it read '50 cents per call.'

The American was surprised so he asked the priest about the sign.  'Father, I've traveled 
all over America and I've seen this same golden telephone in many churches. I'm told 
that it is a direct line to heaven, but in the US the price was$10,000 per call.  Why is it so cheap here?'

The priest smiled and answered, 'You're in Canada now, son .... it's a local call.'

	<TEXT> A man returns home a day early from a business trip.  It's after midnight.   While en-route home, he asks the cabby if he would be a witness.  The man suspects his wife is having an affair, and he wants to catch her in the act.  For $100, the cabby agrees.
 
Quietly arriving home, the husband and cabby tip toe into the bedroom.  The husband switches on the lights, yanks the blanket back and there is his wife, naked, with a man!
 
The husband puts a gun to the naked man's head.
 
The wife shouts, 'Don't do it! I lied when I told you I inherited money'.
HE paid for the Porsche I gave you. 
HE paid for your new 25 ft. Ranger Fishing Boat . 
HE paid for your Packer season tickets.
HE paid for our house at the lake.
HE paid for your Golf Trip to St Andrews and your new 4 x 4.
 
HE paid for our country club membership.
and HE even pays the monthly dues!'
 
Shaking his head from side-to-side, the husband lowers the gun.
 
He looks over at the cabby and says, 'What would you do'?
 
The cabby replies, 'I'd cover him with that blanket before he catches a cold.'

	<TEXT> Ale and bread cause all sorts of dental decay. Tooth decay existed long before the dawn of M M's. Archaeologists regularly find signs of tooth decay (and painful tooth repair ) as far back as the Neolithic period, about 9,000 BCE, when humans began to shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture and grain-eating. Starches in the grain and other plants led to tooth decay. Before this, in the Atkins-diet era, tooth decay was rare. http://www.livescience.com/2011-truth-tooth-decay.html </TEXT>
