	<TITLE> England's 2 Summer Tests this summer against Argentina will be very interesting. (IF They can Beat Ireland) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-12 16:00:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This post is basically void if Ireland win next weekend. But Englands streak will be at risk in those tests and England will be fielding a possibly far weakened team. You can guarantee that Argentina will be fielding their strongest team possible to beat us and think they could easily beat us without the nucleus of our team. I feel I may regret not waiting a week to post this!

Edit: I mistakenly said that Argentina will be 'guaranteed' to field their strongest team.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why I think England VS Scotland is going to be the best game between the sides in over a decade. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-10 18:26:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Without trying to sound ridiculously patronising, when was the last time that Scotland played England with nothing more than the goal to get one over England. In previous years when both England and Scotland have played each other and been unbeaten it has been early on in the tournament so there's still the possibility for Scotland to falter later in the tournament.   

However if they win this weekend then they only have the prospect of beating Italy. Scotland have so much to gain from beating England this weekend.  

-Ending England's Unbeaten Streak   

-Win 4 out of 5 6 nations games. Never done before by an Scotland team.    

-Win in Twickenham for the first time since 1983.  

-Win the Triple Crown  

-Have a massive chance of winning the Six Nations. 

The bookies firmly have their money on England to win but I personally as an England fan think this game is going to be an absolute cracker. The bonus points system means both teams are going to be desperate to score as many tries as they can and I don't think Scotland will be intimidated by the atmosphere at HQ. Having said that I still think England will win.  

TL;DR: Buzzed for an absolute stonker of a game tomorrow.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I have spoken to their press office about the possibility of being given permission to post certain videos that are made in more of a montage style than a highlights style. Sadly they said if you want to buy rights you have to do it on an annual basis and it will cost tens of thousands of pounds for that.  

Howver channels like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64OdUq_NWQg t=3s) manage to post full highlights and they don't get any kind of sanction and I know for a fact they do not pay for the rights to the content. I wonder if there is a way to get round it.  

Thanks for your responses /u/BigZtv  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I will be careful not to. My channel is based around sports videos however so every single bit of content is copyrighted in some way or another.  

I have been attempting to contact the copyright holders to say they should monetise my videos as I do not have any monetisation settings enabled. However understandably they would rather just give me a strike and leave it at that, which is fair enough. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Question About Copyright Strikes. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-05 04:10:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi there, I recently got two strikes on my youtube channel for being stupid and attempting to re-upload a video that was taken down in a different style.     


 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/sGJKxCw.png) it appears to say both strikes will expire within two weeks of each other. However am I right in believing that once the first strike expires then the next 3 month 'timer' will start for the next expiration. So in theory I won't lose all my copyright strikes until July/August?  

Also, once I lost my strikes will I have leeway of potentially getting another two strikes or will I always be on a "last chance".  

Thanks for taking the time to read and hopefully help me on this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting comment here. However Wilkinson was additionally a great tackler and his tactical kicking was superb as well. He did a lot of things that were not amazing to watch but they were effective. These things consisted of kicking well for the corners and setting up players around him.  

If you see the clips below, you can see just how good he was at his peak.  
[Clip 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6crfOqj5NaI)  [Clip 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqoEHjR4MxY)  

Also he was a VERY smart player in many ways. If you think back to his quick thinking for that cross kick to [Paul Sackey's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP8AcKTBFFc t=1s) try against Tonga to see he can offer a great deal more than just place kicking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both players in their own right have had to go through some real struggles in my opinion. Jonny had to go through all that grit to get to the 2007 RWC final to fall at the final hurdle. Similarly Carter missed his nations first World Cup triumph in years through injury.   

When I think of the best fly halfs ever both their names instantly spring to mind, well there's Andy Goode too of course. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In this one I wanted to try and portray just how much of an effect this man has had on rugby in England. Obviously there is the craze surrounding the 2003 world cup but there is also so much more. The way that he managed to recover from all those injuries and play in another world cup final was outstanding. I remember in 2005-2006, many people thought he might retire early. What a man and ultimate professional. I strongly suggest you all watch "Building Jerusalem" which is a great documentary about the success of the England rugby team (Non England fans will enjoy it too.)  

I am going to start making more individual player tributes so please send any suggestions you may have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Scotland in many ways. I always thought Scotland is a place where rugby belongs and I feel like if they were on of the top 3 teams they would be terrifying. All the British teams would be thinking, "shit the Scots are coming down" or "god we have to get thrashed by them in the north again". 

I understand this post doesn't make much sense but I feel Scotland will one day hit a run of 2 or 3 years when they will dominate. Be that in 10-15 years.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tips for players against snipers </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-01 14:04:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know I'm preaching to many of the already converted, however here are some of my top bits of advice if your under fire from a skilled scout.

1. DON'T DO A RICKON. No matter how far away they are, if you run straight a decent sniper will easily get you. Zig zag and be a unpredictable as possible until you're in cover.

2. Don't hit the ground! If your under fire don't try and hit the floor. This is a god send for scouts. Instead if you feel that first hit, you go go go! 

3. If you have no cover nearby, fire at the scout. The suppressing fire will make their aim inaccurate. This should give you time to get to cover or get support from your team.


Hope these help if nobody has heard any of these bits of advice before. </TEXT>
