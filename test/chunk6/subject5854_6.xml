	<TEXT> Its probably a combination of the heroin and his own obsession with food and piling garbage into his stomach... some people lose weight when doing heroin but I think it would make Artie just not give a fuck about anything at all, then on Stern they would have those huge gourmet cupcakes every day and Artie would just go to town on cupcakes and hawaiian punch. Then he would get home and his mom would have a pyrex full of pasta bake and lasagna waiting for him in the fridge. He was surrounded by food and had no reason to care about himself or his health so he would probably just wolf that all down in an opiate stupor and then sit for  the rest of the day watching Charlie Wilson documentaries and sportscenter.

Maybe if he never did heroin he still wouldve blown up to the point where you could lay him on his stomach and spin him around in circles on it without his feet or head touching the ground, or maybe he wouldve realized at some point hes becoming a rotund mess and would care more about himself and his health and did something about it. Plus opiates also constipate people so when he eats as much as he does and it all just sits in his digestive system for days on end, that can't be good for keping the weight down either </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's decent but not incredibly eventful at all, if you don't like Ellis I would avoid listening cause it's heavy on him talking, if you do like Ellis and didn't catch this it'd be worth listening to. If you don't care either way but want to listen try going a little ways in skipping the smalltalk since there's some Jim/Opie splitup talk somewhere in the 2nd half hour-ish of the clip, although it wasn't much that we have not heard before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh look who it is! Had to add these man they are some of my favorite for years now and I always go back to them every couple months. Great work on them, I especially like how there's a pause so you know its a new clip.

Early Chip is the best IMO, I still like Chip now but once he discovered working blue, he got very loud and angry compared to his early days and almost on par with Dice he now loves his taglines. Probably hard to keep a character fresh but I would miss him if he went away. Anthony's reactions to him and everyone in the room's pure hatred for him in these clips cracks me up. I forgot he used to call into the show and then say shit off to the side like "Tss they're laughin their balls off in there" when absolutely no one was doing so. 

Thanks for the great stuff and glad you're cool with having it in the archive! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's actually a best of too. Not to mention sounds a whole lot like cherry darts but much more boring.

I checked on Ch. 791 too which is named after him and it doesnt seem to be on there either as a live show. On SXM site it says his show airs on Faction but neither of them seems to be live </TEXT>

	<TEXT> #EDIT --

This was a bust... according to SXM site Ellis starts at 10AM ET but could not find a live Ellis show on either of the channels that play his show (Faction / Ch. 791 EllisMate). When Bert asked them what else they were doing this week they said that they were doing Ellis's show before they did their own show today. Maybe we will find out when they get on air if something happened

-------------------------------------------

The last time Jason Ellis interacted with the show being the Opie vs. Ellis thing, could be interesting what gets said on there. Probably will end up being underwhelming in that aspect but we'll see I guess. I'll have that going in the room before the show at 11AM </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should provide examples then... there are plenty of pop culture references in the game and the game is clearly marketed as what I explained to you. Your certainty is unwarranted.

Whether or not you are able to accept the storyline, the game was well reviewed, sold very well, and is loved by many. Your problems with the game are clearly not shared by many others, if only for a small and irrelevant demographic of people who weren't big enough to effect the game's sales or overall reputation.  However you seem to want to paint your opinions as objective multiple times in the thread. Instead of writing your posts from your perspective, you write words like impossible and approach it as "what is the player supposed to think?" when in reality it's just you having an issue with a years old game that has already had a very successful run.

 You have a strange delusion that the criticism you're placing on the game should be universal, when it is not. Your moral dilemma about the game's hunting mechanic is evidence of how far too seriously you've taken video games in general to be honest with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're just taking it way too seriously to be honest. They're not real animals you know, nothing is actually getting hurt so you really don't need to feel bad about shooting a collection of pixels on the screen, which in your comment replies you're making it evident that you have some moral dilemma with this. It's actually just a way to incorporate the wildlife into the game and add hunting as a factor to it for something else to do in the game. 

The entire game is designed like one of those ridiculously over the top cornball action movies where one guy unrealistically ends up being the powerhouse that normally would take an entire army to accomplish.

So yes, to be straight up with you essentially you didn't really get "the joke" the game is presenting you with, because you seem to be approaching the game as if they designed it to be a realistic, plausible, totally run of the mill normal storyline that could totally play out in real life. It's about as realistic as Rambo, Die Hard, Commando, Con Air, The Rock, etc. 

It's just you having a chance to be the main character in and playing out one of those crazy unrealistic 1980s action movies in a cool tropical setting. If you keep that in mind and suspend disbelief a little more, you'll probably have more fun with the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I did hear that part actually, figured he was at least a little more direct a different time this week. That's pretty lame, being that subliminal when almost everyone who's in tune with the internet side of the show or a longer listener knows about Artie's recent criticisms. I'm sure Howard is doing the classic "I'm huge and have a massive audience so talking about you is just giving you attention" but Artie made a few news sites etc, people know about it, might as well just respond.

	<TEXT> My memory is a little blurry on the exact sequence of events but I'll try. 

Doug has a podcast he does in front of a live audience that actually somehow seems to have somewhat of a decently 'dedicated' following.

One of the regulars (one of the guys who talked shit about Anthony and got into a fight with reddit on Twitter last winter-ish) Geoff Tate  was there on the show also along with Bert Kreischer and also one other guy who doesn't talk much.

Doug seems to take his podcast VERY seriously. He plays a set of games about movie trivia etc that people are supposed to bet on or something. 

Bert came in pretty drunk. He brought 100 burgers from Burger King to give out to the crowd. He didn't know however, that the venue the podcast was taking place in was also a restaurant. 

Before the show, he showed up and Doug told him not to distribute or bring up the burgers since it was a restaurant and Doug didn't seem to like the idea of the burgers. 

When the podcast got started, Bert brought up the burgers which Doug didn't like either. The crowd did not seem to share Doug's seriousness about the podcast and cheered about the burgers being distributed, so Bert went off stage during the show and found the burgers. Not clear if he did indeed give them out or not but it seemed like he did. This further pissed Doug off, he wanted the burgers to be a dead issue and it went from being one to getting brought up in front of the crowd to having Bert actually go find the burgers while the crowd cheered for them.

Doug took little snips at Bert with Geoff Tate backing him up and treating Bert like a drunken idiot, for example Doug around 15 minutes in goes "I don't know if you know Bert, but Geoff Tate is **WAAAY** more popular than you. Maybe not overall but with this crowd he is" this got one or two hoots n hollers but most of the crowd didn't back Doug on that.

Bert was not really taking the show as seriously as Doug and throughout it he was going off topic, making a ton of jokes and acting a little drunk etc. the crowd seemed to be enjoying it and laughing at Bert's yumor.

Once Doug tried to start playing the games he wanted silence and reverence for his podcast on stage from everyone and Bert was continuing his light hearted off topic humor etc. Eventually Doug spazzed out and got all whiney in his voice and pretty much told Bert he needed to leave and get off the stage. The crowd was booing and not agreeing with Doug. At that point Bert didn't leave.

From that point forward for whatever reason, Geoff Tate seemed threatened by all the laughs Bert was getting and he started getting really snippy with Bert at any chance he got to put him down or act patronizing under the guise of humor.

At some point, as a joke, Bert said something I can't recall to Geoff about "Maybe if you actually had a comedy special anywhere for once in your career, cocksucker" which got laughs from the crowd. At that point Geoff was very annoyed.

The show tried to continue on but eventually somewhere in part 2, Doug and Geoff went off on Bert again and told him to get off the stage and leave. That time Bert actually did leave in sort of a pouty awkward way. The show continued and Geoff tried to make a bunch of jokes and get the crowd back but the vibe in the room seemed really uncomfortable and the crowd for the most part was sided with Bert throughout the whole thing. Doug realized this and mentioned that it was awkward and kind of sad, he seemed to feel bad when Bert actually did leave the stage. The show went on for another 20-30 mins and then ended.


The next day Doug appeared on Bert's podcast and they tried to recap the whole night and clear the air in general. Doug IMO seemed a little pissy and whiny on this Bert podcast too. Bert would sort of admit his mistakes but defend himself too. All in all, it was MUCH to-do about pretty much nothing.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it's a work. Benjy probably did come in late on accident but Howard just took it and ran with it, he even said it himself that it was a guestless day and he was guaranteed looking for time filler. Benjy being late was like handing him 40-60 mins of decently compelling radio on a silver platter. I doubt Benjy coming in late was a planned engineered incident but I would bet money that Stern's entire tirade about it was just a punched-up time killer to make some decently interesting office controversy radio that he knows fans enjoy.


He will then use Benjy being outside the studio as a go-to time filler for awhile, then he'll use Benjy's return to the studio as an hour or 2 of radio too. 

Benjy will end up doing something outside of the show where Howard will say "wait a minute Gary's sending me a note right now that Benjy's up to something outside the studio" -- Gary walks in and rants about Benjy disrupting things outside the studio for the past couple weeks, annoyed at him -- Howard then gets Benjy on mic and berates him again -- someone else like Jason / JD / Ronnie will come in and pile on Benjy -- Benjy continues to defend himself -- another hour or 2 killed off. Updates the next day or a couple days later for another 30min off the clock.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They stuck the bat in a bunch of girls holes

Jim fucked an underage drunk girl(s) in the back room. I think he didn't find out till after that she was underage

An intern got a blowjob from one of the contestants (I think it was the same incident/girl who Anthony went on to date, Melinda/Melissa or w/e her name was)

One of the girls started bleeding to the point were EMS/police were called

After the show had ended things continued and eventually O A J snuck out the back hoping not to get fired and/or arrested

Insertion was permanently banned from the show in any capacity

The Jaegarmeister machine was removed from the building

Over the years all of the above have been heavily hinted as being the truth about that show. The one about the intern and the ones about insertion and the jaegarmeister machine are guaranteed to be true because they were both obviously happening and/or announced on the show. 

I have that show btw if you can't find it anywhere, it used to be very difficult to get a hold of but I'm sure it's easier now </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This might get some downvotes cause from what I've been reading most people aren't going, but I'll just be straight up with you and say what I felt honestly when reading this, what you wrote sounds overly sensitive about this whole thing to me. Way too incredibly sensitive. Everyone has things they don't like right away about their significant other, and it's completely normal to commiserate about them with their friends instead of coming right to you about them. It doesn't mean that they might not grow to like them, it just means the things seem weird to them as they're just being exposed to them or exposed to another person doing those things when they haven't seen that before. What that actually means is that she cares about you and doesn't want to hurt your feelings, but she still thinks it's weird. No big deal at all. Weird isn't always bad, she might just grow to love your differences but you gotta handle it right and frankly not how you're handling it so far.


You have some quirks. Everyone does. There's nothing wrong with this. Quirkiness is something that is going to be found weird by others, but she's not planning to leave you over it and she never said anything that's truly shattering. It seems so dramatic to me that you feel "shattered" over the comments she made to her girlfriends.Nothing she said warrants feeling shattered, in fact it's kind of nice that you got to hear her honest opinions, completely unfiltered unlike the way she might have come to you about them. It's not like she said she's going to break up with you or anything like that, and what she told you later that night is completely correct. She didn't brush off your feelings, she's trying to tell you not to be feeling that way because none of it was intended to make you feel that way, it's not coming from a place that had that intention from her.

My advice is that to be in a long term relationship you gotta come to terms with the fact that your girlfriends are always going to find some things strange about you, they're never going to see you as completely perfect or absolutely love every single thing about you. They are going to talk about it with their girlfriends and laugh about it, it's no big deal. You might just be blinded by a fresh new feeling of love, but believe me you'll eventually start to find weird things about her if you haven't already. It's okay to talk about those with your friends too but more importantly to get to a comfort spot in your relationship that you can joke about those things together on both sides. That's where some fun comes in.

Be proud of your  quirks, they make you unique. I wouldn't focus on the fact that your pillows are from an ex at all cause no one would like that guy or girl in any relationship. Don't take yourself so seriously that you can't joke or can't feel comfortable with her joking about it, it will close doors in your relationship. Definitely don't mope or be all down about it, she didn't say she thinks you're a total loser or anything, she just said some stuff is not normal to her but she wasn't talking about it in a 'room goes silent' 'concerned discussion' way, she was trying to laugh it off. Going forward from this just make jokes about them and be happy about them. Make your casserole and announce that you're making your shitty casserole and make loud mmmmmmmmm sounds while eating it. Let her make fun of the casserole to you and joke back about it tell her she simply has no fancy taste your casserole is where its at. Brag to her friends all about your gourmet casserole sarcastically next time you're around them with a cheshire cat smile and make her laugh about it.Let her rib you about them in person, hit her back with a few ribbings of your own and have a laugh at it together. That's part of what makes a relationship fun, busting each others chops a bit. A girl doesn't exist in the world who will ever see you as a completely normal, heavily desirable hero at all times and about all things and the way that people get that off their chest is either to laugh at it with their friends, or if/when they feel comfortable enough, laugh about it with you. You moping and feeling shattered isn't going to help in any way to get your relationship to a place where that comfort level is there to have fun with it, it's going to do the total opposite actually. Just be proud of yourself and laugh about it more. Everything you're experiencing within what's happening in this relationship with this girl is normal and will happen with pretty much any girl out there, it's just life and it's no big deal. Good luck and have fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem man playing a lot of old stuff mixed with some new in between, 1995-ish KROCK with all the staff drama and pile ons and anti-PC Howard is great to see again. It's insane how much culture has changed now 50% to 3/4 of what he's doing on all these shows would generate instant Twitter outrage and probably get him suspended if he did it today </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who really knows, millions sounds a little nuts, I'd think if they could produce those kinds of numbers to potential advertisers they'd be doing a hell of a lot better than DeepDiscount and BetDSI. Also it's sort of a business move to tell Luis the network makes millions while also telling him at the same time that his show brings in no subscribers or views which he said they told him that when contract negotiations fell apart, because its simultaneously feeding him with an incentive to get his show to re-sign, while also cutting him down so he takes a small salary for it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone was saying the Cowhead thing wasn't real and that would make sense even though it's a weird and random joke thats more confusing than funny... he'd either have to move to NY or do the show with Opie through an ISDN line. If that's really true theres no way it lasts long. Also if anything Anthony said was true about no one being able to last long doing a show with Opie, Vic/Sherrod/DiStefano will either stop coming in so often within a few months or just get audibly sick of doing radio with him. It's almost a guarantee the Cowhead thing was completely faked (he probably got Cowhead in on it too) to try and generate buzz so he can show execs people want it then try to lobby for it to happen... if that's true it's even funnier because it backfired, the top response tweets were people saying Please no and Cowhead calling everyone fuckface

Not only that, if what Anthony/East Side Dave were saying about how Opie treats other shows/staff, lies and manipulates and 'backstabs' people by stringing them along only for them to get left in the dust... I would bet money he's convinced Vic / Sherrod / DiStefano that the execs have 'shown interest' in getting him a cohost spot, fooling them all into coming in and doing radio with him all the time because in their head they're competing to get a paid afternoon gig at Sirius. In reality everything that Opie actually said during the contract stuff pointed to them barely even showing interest in having Opie there as a host, so there's no chance they care about finding him a cohost on a 1 year contract, and he's fooled all the comedians who support him so he can string them along and get them to come in all the time and carry his show.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who are the 'most' here that hate anything Jimmy does? You're the dope who got all mad at the Nancy Grace interview 5 minutes after it aired saying they blew it and ruined the chance at getting good radio... a day later it was everywhere

https://www.reddit.com/user/Sippycupofpee/submitted/

* The show was good today without Jim.Jimmy just seems to bring a cloud of tension anymore.

* This sub is so confused about what is actually entertaining. Jim and Sam both suck, Sams laugh competes with Jims tired old 'I'm a perverted gay but not gay, addict' schtick.

* So, apparently opie is doing a show today, didn't invite JIMMEeeeee. So Jimmy tried to put a show together with Sam and it almost didn't happen because don wickland didn't want to be bothered with it. Jim was not talked to with the respect he deserves so is NOT happy with don, and...

* It's time for jim to take a break from sirius, he just kills the atmosphere with guests.

* So whats your favorite part of Jimmy and Sam show? Sams voice/laugh? Jimmy's worn out quips or BS tranny jokes? ($60k)

* I have no ideal why this sub wants OPIE gone. He has been 90% of the entertainment here. Jimmy is just so played in his comedy, Opies mental state can only get funnier.

* How long til Sam and his hole get tired of Jim norton?

* What's the odds worm norton goes on Anthony's show teusday when opie premiers.

* So big Jim norton blocked people from the show because they didn't invite Jim on their podcast. Hear that Doug benson!!

* How will Sam deal with angry Jim?

* K fucknutz, opies show today found some legs..


... you're most definitely a cut above anyone else here with hating Jim Norton and consistently try really hard to show backhanded support and love for Opie, just be honest with yourself and us and say what you like/don't like instead of trying to play to the narrative of the sub to get your Jim hate out. This underhanded shit is extra cowardly being that this is an anonymous message board but I think you know if you don't do it your dribble would never get read by anyone

Any of those sites or any website named in the title, reports are surging since 2PM across the board on most of the bigname sites I've checked. I'm surprised reddit hasn't been hit. 

What could this be? Usually we'll hear about a site or two a day going down, but this is a major outage hitting everywhere. Some people are blaming Level3, a VPN service as being the vehicle through which a huge DDoS attack is occurring.

	<TEXT> Without a doubt, he's really moving and shaking with the higher ups but he gets thrown around offices like he's a 3rd week intern.

Also this might be a reach, but Vic sounded a little tired/annoyed at the start of today's show before Artie came in. Maybe he was putting his best foot forward every day before today, trying to play it real smooth and match Opie's over the top weird hyper energy, the one he's been using as a diversion so his listeners are fooled into believing there's something worth listening to while the content is completely empty... Vic just trying to fake the chemustree in hopes that he would beat out Sherrod and DiStefano and grab that 2nd mic cohost spot permanently. Those Bruno royalties were drying up fast and he was ready to cash in on the Opie investment with a stable part or full time spot on the afternoon show. Then after all that effort stomaching Opie's daily horse shit, thinking there's still a chance, he logs on to Twitter yesterday and a big ugly picture of Cowhead is staring back at him... scans the caption, and disappointment quickly morphs into rage when he reads "Opie show" "cohost" "December". All that wasted time pretending Opie's remotely fun to be around thinking theres some actual money/stability on the other end of it and fucking Cowhead gets the spot without having done more than an hour of radio with Opie in his entire career. Yet he was still booked for today and like you said, he didn't have shit better to do as an alternative </TEXT>

opieradio I swear that I don't know how to turn this horrible selfie filter off...sorry.

Translation:

*Well, I went too far. There was a shadow of a doubt when it was Theo and DiStefano next to me, but not even Hellen Keller would believe Artie's face is authentic here. The only thing to do now is play dumb, everyone will think I'm a real regular joe, eh the ol lady musta put some fancy filter on my phone here, waddo I know I'm just here doin my show, these phones these days ya know Chris? You gotta turn this fawkin thing off man! Look at Artie, he looks like *insert joke from Twitter comments as my own* *!

Loffs had all around, DiStefano turns off the app Opie downloaded and configured himself 2 weeks ago, Opie goes right into the fake sigh of relief attitude, back to shuckin and jivin and silently sulking to himself cause he's not going to be able to use his newfound youth generator, wide open vulnerability for the haterz to run wild on Photoshop again....

	<TEXT> EDIT: Horror marathon starting now on http://cytu.be/r/opieandanthony but the Stern TV marathon will begin after we get done watching IT. Link to the channel for Stern marathon will be there

**HERE IS THE MEGALIST** -- http://pastebin.com/iYNp4w3s Anything on that list is playable all weekend. Just send me a PM on the channel listed or here on reddit for what you want played. Also the service were using has a "Poll" function so we can vote on what we want up next etc. Feel free to suggest anything the playlist is totall open right now. I'm drinking pumpkin beers and eating pizza and lookin forward to watching some Howard with everyone, c ya soon!


I do have stuff separated by staff members and topic like -- fights / roasts / Sal   Richard / Artie / girls / games   contests (Win Fred's Money etc) on and on

I'll look for anything like that which foreshadows the changes that were to come. Although, my material really starts thinning out as it gets further past 2011, my biggest bulks are in the circa 1995 KROCK era and 2006-10 Sirius era

~'95 KROCK is great with plenty of Howard, Fred, Robin Jackie fights... the Fred/Jackie folders are particularly extensive and always fun to watch together. Gange bashing, Gary bashing, intern+staff drama and infighting, all that good stuff (Howard arguably in his prime of staff trolling / instigating fights) 

good amount of E! Show stuff when they got the new TV-friendly studio/early Artie era... 

lots of heroin downfall era Artie material although most of that everyone's seen a hundred times on YouTube... still though, it's pretty fun watching stuff together and makes a difference / gives it a new replay value. That's my favorite thing about these is discussing it as its playing!). 

Plenty of Channel 9, but in the past people were getting bored of Ch.9 pretty quick. 

Also have an absolutely absurd amount of interviews but those never seem too popular either, still open to requests from the list.

Speaking of that tomorrow when I get these hard drives plugged into my computer I'll include a full file list to check out with the whole library anyone can put in a play request from

Also if anyone is interested we have a separate [O A synctube channel](http://cytu.be/r/opieandanthony) but tomorrow we're doing a horror movie marathon on it which we've been doing every weekend this october. Everyone is welcome to watch some horror movies, it'll be right after that the weekend-long Stern marathon begins! Link to that will be posted tomorrow night during the horror movies and here on the sub. Cya then! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly... Pretty sure Car Crash Comedy by O A actually came well before both of those and it's the exact concept of Kill Tony but much funnier and a lot less awkward. Redban is a bigtime fan of O A, if he had anything to do with the creation of Kill Tony I wouldn't doubt he jacked the concept from those episodes. IIRC the first Car Crash Comedy was around 10 years ago...

If you want a copy of it I'll send it later tonight

I did save the link in bookmarks, might just grab a month sub there to grab them and go on a spree of finding more datafile stuff for the month, but I saved your name on Friends just in case.

Bass was booming out of this world, for convenience here is an all-in-one part1/2 38min with audio mix leveled out  and downloads enabled. Thanks /u/crookedmile for this and for the heads up in general, haven't been playing close attention to Artie or Howard lately so this was clutch....

 Sternbot fans who swallow everything Howard spits at them and people who discovered Howard a year ago will call this a dog barking at the moon and use excuses like that but he's honestly 100% on the money. Howard wants to pretend for the most part that everything he did to earn himself all the money he has now never existed and never even happened. Opie seemed to try to do the same shit the only difference was he didn't have any power or influence or charisma so it got shut down completely. Howard's gotten away with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much imranr11 you are truly the man!! 

If anyone's wondering about this show I highly recommend if you want something that's light and easy to pick up but not too light that it's totally corny or anything. This show is a very lighthearted take on cop/crime TV shows. It's got upbeat music, a quick pace, lots of comedy peppered into each episode, and yet it doesn't try too hard to sugar coat the murders Monk is trying to solve or the criminals he's going after. 

Besides having a much less gritty and more comical mood than Law and Order, it's in the same type of style as those shows. A murder kicks off the episode, sometimes you don't see the murderer and you can figure it out with Monk, and sometimes you see the murderer and watch as Monk tries to solve it. Each episode is encapsulated within itself save for a few 2-part to be continued episodes throughout the show. This makes it nice because you can just throw on a random episode, watch it enjoy, and it won't totally hook you in where you have to binge watch or wonder what happens at the end of each episode. While I love those type of shows it's nice to have something you can eat up in 42 minutes and go about your day without wondering.

Basically Monk is a detective in San Francisco. He has an assistant (two different actresses play his assistant and they switch somewhere midway through the series), an agoraphobic brother, and he is a widower who was deeply in love with his wife, who was murdered before the series picks up. This is a recurring storyline throughout the entire series -- Monk will find little clues, **The thing that makes Monk unique as both a character and what differentiates this from the average crimesolver police show is his severe mental disorders.**


Monk has severe OCD, germophobia, and plenty of little quirks about himself involving order and cleanliness, mostly based around that disorder and that phobia. However.. because he has these problems, it turns him into something of a super-detective. It's been awhile so I can't remember if he is specifically employed by the SFPD or if they use him as an independent consultant, but either way, he's so good at noticing things out of order, extremely perceptive at reading a room and getting a feel for the last things that happened in it, noticing tiny subtle details about people, that he's the top detective in the city by far. 

He has a reputation among the police as being slightly difficult to work with because of his quirks, the main sergeant is a classic cop type character with his right hand man being a little more goofy but determined, and although the sergeant cop thinks Monk is a pain in the ass and they bump heads all the time, he recognizes his brilliance and realizes he needs him around.

Overall the show is a great balance of light comedy / mood / cinematography, mixed with semi-gritty opening scene murders, clever writing, twists and turns, and enough character development and storyline arcs to glue the series together very well. Tony Shaloub is absolutely brilliant in this role and won an Emmy and Golden Globe in 2003 and another Emmy in 2005 for his performance as Monk. I highly recommend it, I used to love this a ton in high school and I'm so looking forward to diving back in! Thanks /u/imranr11 !

	<TEXT> I despise Trump, but still think it's shitty to unearth slightly racey clips of he or his son bullshitting to get Opie's name into the news. Fuck that guy.

Yeah, could care less who's in the news for what but I'm totally with you on that last bit. It's pathetic, 100% driven by the fact that Opie's ego can't accept that he's now the radio equivalent of the kid in Little League who botched so many plays the coach just threw him off in right field for 2 innings a game to avoid damage control the rest of the season. Then right after that the kid who used to sit bench was given a chance in shortstop and flipped a double play to end the inning a week later while Opie watched in envy from the outfield. Now he's so green with envy his total void of self awareness went into overdrive and hes selling out a multiple time guest who was always pretty 'loyal' by Opie's standards, did the show even when he got more popular with the Apprentice etc. It's not that I care about DT Jr. getting skewered it's Opie's sleezebag pathetically desperate treatment of it, all so he can try to imagine himself competing with the morning show with a little blurb in a side section of CNN's website that pretty much fell off as fast as it went up. His desperation is disgusting </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes Opie's astounding lack of self awareness pays off in ways that are hard to even imagine but this is almost too far for me to enjoy. He doesn't have a clue how scummy this looks and how he just showed himself to be so desperate for attention he sold out a multiple time guest who showed a liking for his show, gave great appearances (for a son of a rich guy TV side-host) gave attention to their show when he was bigger on Celebrity Apprentice, and in return desperate sleezebag Opie sells him out for a tiny little blurb in a side section of CNN and 5 minutes of attention.

 If there is a stronger word for pathetic this deserves it. I could care less about who's getting what kind of attention in the news but this is almost mildly rageworthy, that strong stench of pathetic desperate jealousy from the Nancy Grace buzz motivated scumbaggery coming off of him is really deserving of Opie falling flat on his face over this. Really hope this gets totally ignored by DT Jr </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anthony's calls into Jim and Sam have been a million times more enjoyable than either of the Opie+Ant phone calls. One of the only complaints I can think of so far for the new J S show is sometimes Jim sounds really mellow and tired, just kind of low key all around. It's not every day by any means just here and there for my ears maybe like 25% of the total air time. Other times he seems to wake right up and it's an awesome show. 

Sam seems to be good at keeping energy up on his side, but I don't think they have the experience just yet where Sam knows how to get Jim into his high energy quick jokes and the more entertaining version of himself. Although I noticed he definitely seems to be slowly improving on that ability which is cool to hear. On the other hand, it shouldn't just be on Sam to get Jim revved up in the morning. I hope Jim didn't take that cockbag Sean's comment about sounding like he's had too much coffee to heart because that criticism couldn't have been more off base IMO

However back to the beginning of this ramble, when Anthony called in last week you could tell how much it woke Jimmy right up. He instantly was back in his 3rd hour of the show XM era O A mode. It was great and I wish that call went on for hours. Anthony sounded like he was tuned in really well even through the raspy frog voice and just woken up they were all funny as hell and I laughed several times throughout that. Seemed completely effortless all around. 

Compare that to the Opie calls and it's just embarassingly forced on both Anthony and Opie's part. First call not as much because they had all the things to hash out and Paul/Vos did half or more of the talking.. but this 2nd call was almost cringe inducing. . Give them another phone call or two, or even better, an appearance on TACS by Opie, and we will have that full on dead conversation, like when you have one of those calls or meetups with an old friend or family member that doesn't go how it used to go, you get a quarter into the conversation before youre spending half the time pretending to listen to them and the other half brainstorming silently to yourself for something to bring up when the current topic inevitably goes dead, just to avoid that awkward silence where the realization that the easygoing nature of your past friendship is totally vanished and you're talking to a half stranger you don't want to talk to anymore. 

That might be the only actual value of Opie   Anthony calls/'reunion' shows, listening to them frantically scramble to give off the facade that the chemustree isn't 100% extinct, since at this point they're both using each other as a mutual escape rope, and if the forced, awkward nature of their current relationship is exposed, they both lose something, but Opie loses much more. Any and all of his leverage or hype will be gone for next October, he'll keep the haircut, get offered a shorter one, or they'll just cut him out and do away with his office interrupting, drama creating antics, and his totally guest dependent format for his show. Which is becoming blatantly obvious he can't carry whatsoever on his own, not even solo with Erock for support. Kind of sad. Either way it will be a very interesting year... looking forward to watching where that ship gets steered, and for more Anthony + Jim + Sam enjoyable funny radio.  Ant has the benefit of having 2 options and one is clearly much better than the other both for us and for him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd be my hero man... I did find a few torrents but the seeding was not working out too well at all and some of the qualities were even worse than old basic 4:3 TVrips. Haven't tried since earlier this summer though. 

If/when you get the time to it'd be very appreciated, but I know you guys stay busy though. I don't have much to give in return that you probably don't have easy access to already, but if you're a fan of Howard Stern I do have like 300gigs of HowardTV rips I could upload somewhere as a payback.

featuring Tony Shalhoub as a detective in San Francisco... he has a slew of mental disorders including severe OCD / germophobia, but his psychological hangups become advantages in the criminal investigation world. 

It's a lighthearted, sometimes funny, sometimes thrilling and suspenseful show.  Simple and easy to watch but with pretty good writing from what I remember and overall some very easy going murder mystery entertainment. 

Aired on USA network. My buddy and I used to love this show back when we were younger. If anyone could find this one it would be appreciated so much as I would really love to watch it again and to burn my friend some DVDs to mail for Christmas this year!

Don and Mike were part of my first wave of radio interest.

	<TEXT> I agree it's not O A 100%. That really was something else and what truly brought us all here at some point.

But what it really deserves to be compared to is the show we narrowly escaped having on in the morning, which was O J or Opie solo show.Out of any possibilities we could've gotten this is so far and away the best option, when it was actually happening I couldn't even believe it, seemed too good to be true but here we are.

Every show and every single second of it isn't amazingly good and there's some kinks to work out along the way but it feels so nice and almost foreign at this point to enjoy what I'm hearing, laugh at it, get happy that the show is on in the mornings to enjoy, and see how they do and how they keep growing it and building on it. I think it's even significantly improved from some of the stuff they were dealing with week 1. Anyone who's been around the past 2 years can hear that Jim is having such a good time and it's hilarious even if its stupid, with that soundboard and his dumb jokes, and you can tell Sam is pumped up and happy to have this show now, IMO you can tell he's been ready for it for awhile. 

All in all it's almost weird to enjoy the morning show again.. I'm sure they will do stuff to piss us off and annoy us but it'll be out of us liking the show and its potential instead of straight out pure disgust at what's perpetrating our eardrums like it was, only about a month ago. Characters are coming back, bombed jokes are being celebrated, mean humor is creeping back in, cringe interviews... Opie mightve forgotten what this show was suppose to be about but lucky for us everyone around him didnt't. Horsecock and Sam to the future </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly this would be a rude way to treat a guest if it was most other people besides Nancy Grace or people like Grace. She's a complete bully, hard to figure out a better way to put it, the news pundit version of a bully who treats real life stories like 2 week long perez hilton esque sensationalized tabloid stories. Like as in kidnappings, murders, parents allegedly killing their children, missing kids, she'll interview the parents and start grilling them like maybe they're responsible... as if that's her job to do.  Worst of all she plays judge and jury and writes it off using her law degree as some sort of extra authority to decide what it looks like they might be (innocent or guilty) she has a signifcant and loyal following of the type of people that like their news to feel like professional WWE wrestling with a tinge of anger. Compared to her own modus operandi they were pretty polite to her. But in the end theres no need to take my word for it, if interested more in her I'm willing to bet theres a slew of videos on youtube where one can see her in action on her HLN show </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow... I might be biased but I really can't stand Nancy Grace. I've had family members who used to love this show in the past and I've seen her in action one too many times to not appreciate this.. she spends decades doing this and much worse to people who've been through real, actual traumatizing events, you'd think maybe she would know how to handle it a little better. Satisfying to see the tables get turned for once, and did she ever crumble quick. Once the host brought up her exploitation of WWE wrestlers using their injuries/deaths under the veil of playing 'concerned citizen' to sensationalize a story she could chew on for a few weeks on TV before spitting out and moving on, she seemed to lose her footing almost immediately. That was some solid mini-justice for a lady who's spent years doing this to others in front of millions more viewers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He actually has to do something that would enter into our ears for us to hate on him. Some people talk about his podcast here, but that might as well be a tree falling in the forest.

I actually just listened to his segment a few nights ago where he ripped on Louis CK and Ricky Gervais for coming in and acting pretentious or ballwashing each other. He was completely right to do it because they were getting a little cunty, but at the same time I realized it's coming from a shitty place with Jay Mohr. It's like he wanted Louis to act a certain specific way or he wanted Louis to notice him and acknowledge him more for whatever reason, act like they were buddies in the studio, and when Louis was doing his own thing it made Jay insecure so he got all pissy about it on the phone afterwards. Jay just seems like the type who isn't happy for people when they get successful, he gets jealous and insecure about himself around them so he starts looking for ways to cut them down in order to feel better about his own career shortcomings </TEXT>
