	<TEXT> I'd rather the award go to someone who didn't sit for rest. I think Kawhi was right there a month ago, but the slump he is in now is not helping. Also, they would have had to get the 1 seed for him to be a serious contender, and that's not going to happen. I'm fine with them not giving it to Kawhi, even though I think he's probably the best basketball player on the planet right now (people keep saying he's number 2 and Lebron is number 1, but I don't understand why the number 2 out plays/beats the number 1 every time they play each other.)

	<TEXT> Shaq's best season, as you would expect, was when he was 27 years old. He had his most points, assists, and second highest rebound total, and he did this as a member of the Lakers. Shaq hit his prime when the average basketball player hits his prime. He was in pretty damn good shape in LA. If you researched how much every basketball player weighed when they entered the NBA and what they weighed when they hit 30, you'll see that players tend to put on weight. This narrative that Shaq was fat for most of his career and could have been something special doesn't jive with the facts. Shaq was in shape for most of his career, and he WAS something special. Yes, Shaq was out of his shape late in his career, but it seems that's all people remember. I'd take Shaq on the Lakers over Shaq from the Magic any day.

Edit: Also, I've read reports that say he intentionally put on weight (http://www.stack.com/a/remember-when-shaq-was-ripped-and-super-athletic-heres-how-he-put-on-so-much-weight). Let's not forget, Shaq wasn't the best center in the league when he played for Orlando. He might not have been in the top three, honestly. He was dominated by Hakeem. By the time he was on LA, and no one could move him, he was the most dominate center/maybe even player in the league.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't seen any indication that we have the kind of ball movement that can keep a defense like this on their toes. Kawhi is not going to be able to carry us as easily when he is getting doubled for an entire play off series, and the movement off the ball is not good enough for Kawhi to find open shooters out of the double team. When he does find them, they are missing the shots. I think we are clearly the second best team in the NBA. The sky is not falling. You have to wonder, though, how we got to this point in three years time. Three years ago, the Spurs were the best passing team (maybe of all time!). The disparity between that 13-14 team and this year is huge. It makes you really appreciate how good Timmy and Boris were at passing the ball.

People act like everyone freaks out for no reason after a loss. I have to wonder if those same people have been watching the Spurs all year. These issues have been here all season, and they've been there during the losses and the wins. It hard to believe they'll be magically fixed when we enter a play off series. As a fan, I see these problems being exposed even more in the playoffs, and it's hard to see this team in the finals.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's 25 years old and he's sat games this season for rest. He'll be fine. He's averaging about the same amount of minutes as last year. And if those are the greatest shooters of all time, then that tells you something. Even the greatest shooters go through slumps. Kawhi is obviously just going through a shooting slump. His legs are fine. He's playing great defense. He's getting a step on his man and hitting mid range jump shots.  </TEXT>

Neither team is allowed to smell the playoffs... I wouldn't call 6 games ahead of the last ranked team in the west as being in a better place by far. Hypotheticals don't put you in a better place. The Sixers have to actually show that they can draft these people and keep them on the court before we can entertain the idea that the 13th ranked team in the East is in a much better position than the 15th ranked team in the West. If you going to include hypothetical situations, you're ignoring the Lakers hypotheticals, such as being in the better position to attract free agents like Paul George. </TEXT>

The guy averaged 23 points, 11 rebounds, and nearly 60% FG for his career. He's unquestionably a top 5 all time center...not someone who just had some great years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I think he knows what kind of player he is, but I don't know if that's a Spurs kind of player. Defensively, he would be a downgrade from pretty much all of our guards. I don't know if it's necessarily just a effort thing either. He certainly lost lateral quickness since his string of injuries. He's also never been a great facilitator. At the end of the day, I don't think the positives are worth the negatives and price tag. 

On another note, I never heard what happened with him disappearing. Did we ever figure out exactly why he did that this year?  </TEXT>

He can still reach his audience and give them what they are accustomed to. The issue is how this edited, which I think he can easily fix. The rapid cuts are too much for me and make me feel queasy.

Edit: I've now been downvoted for supporting and criticizing Robin Black within the span on 2 days. HUZZAH's for everyone! All I am saying is Charlie Sheen was not a talk show host. He also decided he was going to be a comedian around the same time. He was just throwing crap at the wall, hoping someone would give him some money. Robin Black is doing the same exact thing he was doing before. If you liked Robin Black before, there is a chance you are still going to be getting the things you liked from him, especially after he tweaks the editing. This is obviously not true of the Charlie Sheen example. I personally didn't enjoy his breakdowns, so I am obviously not his audience, but he still has an audience, and I think he can still please his audience. If Charlie Sheen's show was any better in production quality and guests, it's because Sheen is/was way wealthier than Robin Black.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bro, are you slow? Did you read everything I've said? The same things (more so) are happening in these threads! You have a few people stepping out and defending him, yet you are claiming everyone shifted. My point is this: there were a few people on a comment with only a couple hundred responses that criticized him prior to the tweet, despite the fact that the guy himself is commenting! People like me said nothing, because obviously I would have been downvoted, and I wasn't nearly as motivated by my dislike of the breakdowns as the people who were sharing it were to silence a contrary opinion. Now we have people on here who come from a litany of different places and opinions to sway what it appears the "sub thinks," but you are ignoring hundreds of different reasons why a shift occurred. Downvoting is a zero sum proposition, but a lot of things in life, such as people's opinions, are not. Whats more, why are you basing the entire subs belief on the activity of a couple hundred members? You can say people are now more motivated, but say that a tweet changed their opinion on something unrelated is silly when you have no evidence to back it up.

People still like Robin Blacks breakdowns, but the climate of the sub makes them less likely to say so. That is how the echo chamber works. People who assume a massive swing in opinion don't really understand how majorities work. When you are talking 200 comments, and 10s of thousands who said nothing, how many people do you really have to sway? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look at my post below. I basically dispute everything you said and show criticisms of him prior to his comments and what happened to those people. I was here, a member of this sub. I tend to pick and choose what I want to get downvoted on, and criticizing a member of this sub to his face wasn't a high priority, so I remained silent. I didn't get what some people liked about his work, but since he gave me no reason to actively criticize something I didn't like, I chose not to do it. I'm still yet to find a case of someone saying they loved the break downs and now they are saying the opposite. We can keep parroting this or we can provide evidence like I did. You can have 200-500 people carry the entire sentiment of this sub. What I saw prior to his comments was a group of people who were highly motivated to share and promote his material on this SUV (one of them was Robin himself). It's not like these videos had massive amounts of response. There's a bigger response to negative posts about him, from a larger group of people, most of whom never commented any support for Robin Blacks breakdowns. What you're saying is just not true and the evidence doesn't support it.

Edit: you know what's funny, go to the Aldo vs Conor break down and see how many people said film flam (mind you, this was prior to the Helwani tweet). I have a feeling you're going to be disgusted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, the building collapsed when the earthquake happened. But we don't know the two are related. The building may have collapsed for an entirely different reason.

Go back to school, bro, and try again. Earthquakes, from prior knowledge and empiricism, tend to cause buildings to collapse. I have no data saying that when someone makes a rude comment people tend to criticize their performance at work. You have to figure out how these things called facts work. You are saying that a comment made by Robin Black caused a whole mass of people to change their opinion about his quality of work at his job without evidence just because you saw the chronology of events.

Here's are some pre-Helwani threads: 

Check out Robin Black's first official UFC piece. So happy for him, hard work pays off!!: https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/3quphn/check_out_robin_blacks_first_official_ufc_piece/

Let's Help Robin Black: https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/3rgm4m/lets_help_robin_black/


Robin Black on the UFC's commentary team:https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2nhz65/robin_black_on_the_ufcs_commentary_team/

All three of those posted by the same person with less than 100 comments. 


Why does Robin Black not work for the UFC?: https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/3nrgit/why_does_robin_black_not_work_for_the_ufc/

Less than 100...

Then you come across his breaks down, which Robin comments on himself. They actually DO include criticisms of his work, but they are downvoted into the ground (probably because they are basically criticizing the guy to his face and we always give people who post on this sub extra love at first) just as I said. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/3vgxug/ufc_194_robin_black_breaks_down_aldo_vs_mcgregor/

That thread actually has people saying exactly what they are saying now: 

I believe he knows the fight game but for some reason this guy aggravates me. Something between the posture and sounding like an infomercial pitchman."

Then you have this one, which was downvoted by 25 people (probably has something to do with Robin actually posting on the forum and bias of people liking him (if we are talking about personal feeling impacting how we see the quality of work)):

So, who's this clown? Robin Black you tell me? Never heard of 'em. And yes, Aldo's right hand will lead him to retain his belt - though I don't believe that has ever been seriously in doubt in the mind of the more knowledgeable MMA fan.

So, yeah, brave people where saying what they are saying now then...

Then we get to post-comment posts:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/4mmza7/robin_black_using_ariels_situation_to_big_himself/

This one has just about double the comments that the most popular pro Robin Black post has.  You're telling me that about 200 people (generously) embodied the mindset of the whole sub at that time?  What about the other half of people who came out when the climate on this sub was anti-Robin Black? What were they thinking? Did you expect all these people to shit on him back then when he was posting on this forum? Please tell me, since you seem to know how everyone was thinking based on a few posts, most with less 100 comments. Search the threads, just about all of his break downs have two things: 1. Robin himself as the top comment 2. People saying it's not that good with tons of down-votes.

Sorry. Sometimes you have to actually think and realize the world isn't black and white. Sometimes things happen for multiple different reasons. Sometimes the building has a weak foundation for whatever reason and a small earthquake takes it down, while all surrounding buildings remain upright... In those case you have to ask, "why did the building fall down and how can we prevent it from occurring again?" Did his comments contribute to the change of opinion about his breakdowns, sure, but did they cause it? I don't think so.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're painting the picture however you like to see it. Loyalty is a strong word, and not one in which I reserve for celebrities and people I don't know. I don't think people lashed out against Robin Black because of their loyalty to Ariel; they lashed out because they saw his comments to be akin to kicking a man while he was down for no reason. I'm sure if you lost your job and someone said, "well, you're not nearly as valuable as me anyway," you might be upset...and I wouldn't blame people for thinking that person was being an asshole to you. I also think those same people should have avoided talking crap about Robin when he lost his job; however, it's not exactly the same as what Robin did, because its a direct response to what Robin did. People understand it as paying him back in kind, which was not what Robin was doing. Most people don't believe in the golden rule, they believe in active karma. Still, I consider both cases to be douchy.

I don't like seeing his content because I don't think it's good.  Period. The idea that the criticisms of his content are direct response to what he said about Ariel is what I find to be silly. I get that people are petty, but this is a dim view of humanity that I just don't subscribe to--and I'm a pessimistic person. We've seen people commit terrible crimes, but nary do people attack them for their performance at their job when it's not related. I mean, OJ murdered people and you never see someone saying, "man, OJ was never good at football after all." Personally, I don't care about Robin Black. Would we get a long in real life? Probably not, but I don't actively dislike the guy. I do think his break downs and music suck though, because I'm entitled to my own personal tastes, and I think everyone who agrees with me on this forum is entitled to that opinion without being accused of having it because he made comments about Ariel Helwani. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You can go look at any of the old Robin Black submissions prior to the Ariel thing and see /r/mma gushing about him. Then you can look at any of the Robin Black submissions afterward and see them downvoted into oblivion with jackass comments about how much everyone hates him for what he said about Ariel.

This is a fact, but I've provided contrary reasons why the opinion shift may have (and likely did) occur. Just because event A happens and then event B happens doesn't meant A caused B...does that make sense? The two can be related, in this case I think there is relationship, but I don't think it's an A caused B relationship. I'm not re-writing history. I am making it clear that those events happened in the order you claim, but I disagreeing with the claim that you know hundreds of people's motivation. I am just not going to act like a mind reader and say I know what those movations were, or claim that this sub has one collective brain. I just want to see 5 people who said they like Robin's breakdowns prior to the Ariel comments who are now saying they hate the breakdowns...that's all I want, just five people. If it's everyone, and literally everyone knows this is a fact, it should be incredibly easy to find five examples. 

Literally everyone on this subreddit who was around knows for a fact that it was the Ariel thing and only the Ariel thing that changed public opinion.

No, I don't and neither do you. If you're going to make this claim, provide some evidence for it. It's not a fact if you don't have any proof other than event A happened and then event B happened...that's not proof of a casual relationship. What you have is a theory based on chronology of events.
