	<TEXT> Don't think that Pudding would go against Germa 66, if she wanted to do something against Mama, she would do something directly related to her. Plans on stealing Tamatebako treasure, maybe put on Germa 66 quarters, that would make sense, but is she that sneaky? Also, needs to be confirmed if she is the three eyes girl.

Reiju, hands are bleeding and thigh is blooded, was she shot by Capone? Don't think so, she seems like a strong character, Maybe she went up against 2 commanders, if Pudding was the one hurting her, I'd be displeased, unless she has a great akuma no mi, which I doubt. </TEXT>

2. rubber can't be cut and stretched indefinitely.

Also, some theorist already said some thing that convinced me, Mama's skill of taking someone's lifespan is based on their fear of dying, Luffy went through hell with Garp so his will to survive wouldn't make him afraid of Mama, thus rending her ability useless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll be honest with you, mate, I don't usually come here asking for help, but when I did when I was building my PC I was always answered, maybe not by many, but by enough. Also, I don't know about you, but if some of my posts aren't as well seen as I was expecting, I'd try to post in a different time the next time, so maybe I could get the attention from more people.

Also, don't limit your search here, go to other forums ask there, will it take some time? Sure, but asking the same question in two different websites is better than just one.

One thing worth mentioning is, sometimes you won't get your answer in a few hours, or a few days, I remember that once I was helped by some dude that came weeks later, you have to play the patience game, people here are helping you for free, if you want answer right away pay for a professional, it is that easy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Demons are parasitic, they feed on people's souls when they are out of touch with themselves so that's when they strike. A swift breeze and a cold cut, it could kill you in a matter of instants, but they are Machiavellian, it want to see you suffer, it want to see the light of your life extinguish, your inner fire grow cold until you are a lifeless body. If they sense that you are not being you, they will attack and when they do, you won't be the same.*

Calm night, desert neighbourhood, a house that doesn't look abandoned, but it has seen better days, a black smog feels a weak presence there, a being that isn't "complete", so, as usual he prepares to possess it. Once it is inside its moves will soon begin, but something feels odd, it feels dazed, the body is not warm as it should be, the weak presence that he felt starts to be overlapped by several other presences: suave, violent, childish, cynical, kind, arrogant, reckless, one after the other their energy start to impose a feeling of threat to the demon.

"You can't leave"

"You can't leave"

"**Who are you? This was supposed to be a weak person**"

"Weak? There isn't such thing here"

"Oh, no there isn't, mister"

"Are you not a demon that possess bodies? Too bad you haven't heard of this"

"**This is ridiculous, I can overcome you with ease**"

"YA'D BE VANISHED, MAGGOT"

"Well put, I'll try to explain in a way that you will understand we all play a part here..."

"I like to play..."

"We know you do, we all play a part here, sometimes we preponderate over each other in some actions, sometimes we act together - which can result in impossible reactions such as trying to swing your left arm to the left, right and touching your scapula at the same time - but, in general, here we do what we can to survive, at least in each of our concepts of survive"

"**It's simple then, I absorb him and I release you from your pain**"

"I don't think you understand yet, demon, we are not products of this person psyche..."

"Aren't we like him?"

"Yes, we are demons, but the difference is that we didn't get in out of free will, we were put in here, God locked us in cells so we won't manifest our true capacity"

"And here we live in harmony, when something exterior is introduced it can destroy the balance"

"OOZE THAT BUG"

"We split you so we can all enjoy the energy, but don't you worry, you weren't the first, you won't be the last, if it serves as comfort..."

"...things have been working like this for millennia, to avoid the destruction of its ultimate creation, God picks a few and introduced in them demons to depopulate an overcrowded Hell"

"And the Devil cares for its locked up children so he sends new bloods to feed the ancient ones"

"**No, I won't end up like this in here**"

"To late now, you have been engulfed by the darkness" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I'd rather having a long break on the series, much like how Masami Kurumada is doing with Saint Seiya: Next Dimension now, than having Bleach end the way it did. If he didn't felt like drawing anymore - even though we knew he loved drawing the characters, he could have just give the info about the story and made a Light Novel with it (if after his break he was still unable to do the work he thought he was supposed to do).

Honestly, some people might think I am being harsh here, but Bleach had a shitty end, I liked how the Thousand Year Blood War arc was going, some might said that it seemed just like the first arc we've seen in SS, but I didn't care, the story was amazing, but he rushed things up and it ended up like shit, that's a fact, the only hope that we have is if some day someone will give Bleach a chance to end in good colours, maybe inspired in Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, a good anime closure would relief the sour taste we still have in our mouths. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Iraq cold winter, might sound weird, but the desert can turn into a frozen hell when the sun sets and there was a man, blank-minded, lying on the sand.

"Where am I?" looking around, trying to find someone to reply his instigation, no one was there.

He gets up and starts wandering, the cold is fearsome, his body shivers, his teeth click, can't feel the tip of his fingers.

But on the horizon he sees an old leather tent, he approaches seeking shelter and he sees an old man, long greyish beard, his skin damaged by the sun, he looked like he could have lived many lives, but that wasn't possible.

"The cold is terrible outside, would you mind if I spent the night here?"

The old man, which was reading a note, raises his head slowly, gives him a quick smirk and replies: "Of course, Frederik, you may take as long as you want."

The man was confused, who was Frederik, was it him, is the old man insane? But that didn't bother him, he had a place to spend the night.

"Why did you call me Frederik? I can't remember anything, do you know me?"

"Oh... I do, Frederik, since many years, how unfortunately for you to forget about your past. If you want I could help you relive some of those old memories."

"Would you... would you do that? I think that maybe even a hint would be enough and better than knowing nothing at all."

The old man, with some effort stands up, grabs a rusty tankard, and starts to pour some water and coffee powder on it. The aroma after some minutes was all over the tent, a strong and bitter smell of a coffee that could help anyone wake up just by smelling it.

"They don't make more coffee like this anymore, where I was from we used to plant great farms of coffee, since then never have I seen coffee like this anymore."

He stares silently, introspective, the man wandered what he meant about the coffee, he drinks it, he agrees with the old man, the coffee really is really well brewed.

"That's some nice coffee, thank you for sharing it with me, now can you tell me something about my past?"

"My dear Frederik, but I am, you see, this coffee that you are drinking and your past are strongly connected, at least for me, so I thought that if I mentioned it it would be a great way to start your tale."

The old man walks towards the opening of the tent, the cold wind is easing up, the sky was clear and filled with stars, he sighs deeply.

"I lived in a region that used to be as arid as this one, everything that you tried to plant would die, the sun was too hot, the soil was too poor, there wasn't enough water, but eventually my civilisation was able to develop a way to surpass all of those adversities. One day, foreigners came wanted to know our secrets, but we couldn't give them, we were swore to protect it."

He then returns, looks at the man, which had already finished his coffee, and sits on his old shredded rug.

"But they tried a more diplomatic approach, sending their 'missionaries' to try to know our civilisation with them. After awhile we grew to have respect for each other, even though foreigners, they would work as locals and respect our traditions, almost living as locals."

"Frederik..." the old man called, because it seemed as he spaced out during that part.

"We saw them as equal, as friends, there was one in special that even wanted to marry my daughter, it wasn't really on my best interests, but who can discuss with their children, right?"

"They got wed, she was expecting, and I thought this was reason enough to believe in him, to entrust him the secret of our prosperity, what we have achieved."

"Frederik..." the man spaced out even longer now, were he pay attention or was he remembering? The old man continued with his story.

"Not so long after my daughter gave birth, her husband had vanished, we couldn't find him. She was sad, but there wasn't much we coul-..."

"Nylva'nnya..."

"I see... so you are starting to remember, Frederik, maybe I can push forward a bit more. The child was three, but then we were attacked, we didn't know who, we didn't know where, we were simply attacked, a huge blast could be heard from all the corners of the city, shrapnel hit people, what was that that could destroy with such violence?"

"No, it can't be, how could that happen..."

"Not long after that, there was an even bigger blast, but this one was different, it made an even bigger cloud, with thick smoke on a weird shape, everything was destroyed, nothing was able to resist, not my city, not my family, all I had left were those coffees."

"You see, Frederik, you were the main responsible for what happened to my city, my daughter and you children."

Frederik collapses, memories start to rush on his head running on a loop, the city on crumble or what was left of it after the attacks, people half alive but unable to survive, all those smells, the sights, everything that Frederik then felt, was coming back. He starts to cry, can't remotely think on anything else but that.

"Frederik, reach for your pocket, I've got something for you there, it's a remote, with it you can forget everything that I just told you, you will be able to have a peaceful life, turn your back on the things that I've just said and start all over again."

Frederik didn't know what to do, was the old man serious, could all that pain and suffering stop with just one push of a button? Frederik thought he had nothing to lose, so he pressed the button.

And as the old man said, gone. All the memories had vanished, no more sadness, no more fear, no more terror.

Actually, Frederik was completely gone.

"You see, Frederik, there is a thing I always forget to mention, I once used your remote too, and I have build one myself, but the thing is, my memories don't work using synapse, so the electrical influence on time travel doesn't affect what is inside my head as it will affect in yours, so I use this on my advantage, you see in time travels it isn't your whole body that can travel through time and space, but what some would call the concept of 'mind'. That's why I remember, and you don't, that's why I come back every time, because watching your first reaction is always better than letting you live with guilt, maybe some day I'll break free of this curse..."

The day started to dawn, the first rays of light started to warm the old man's skin

"...but tonight I have an appointment with you in Samarra." </TEXT>
