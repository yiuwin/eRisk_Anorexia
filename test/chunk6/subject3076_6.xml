	<TEXT> I am curious as to how you think people recover from alcohol abuse. It seems that you think it's more than just not drinking.

For me I got so exhausted. My last drunk was terribly emotional and something kind of snapped inside me and I went "Yaaaah I dunno if I can do this anymore"

And I loooved being fucked up. 

I kind of tricked myself into going to rehab and it worked. I signed up, went through the motions with little to zero resolve to stop...but then I got there and went "Ok. Well I guess I can try"

But it wasn't something I could just do on my own. I believe I needed serious inpatient help. I had very strong habits and patterns that needed to be broken. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes small efforts build into massive shifts. A 20 minute walk after dinner was the start of my dad getting on track with losing weight, getting off blood pressure medication, learning to meditate, getting a new job, and turning his outlook on life around. 

My recovery didn't happen in one day with giant life altering decisions. 

It was OK, never drink. Ever. Then it was "first things first" and "easy does it" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My name is Victoria. You have consent to use what I write in this comment. 

I found SD by searching around reddit for recovery subreddits. I found SD and really liked the vibe. It was more laid back than some of the other subreddits and seemed to have a different way of being. 

What I like about SD is that there are so many different people here. Not everyone here says that they are alcoholic, and many don't even use that terminology. I don't. There are binge drinkers here, people in college who worry about their consumption...there are older people, younger people...I think what's cool is that we share a common theme: that we have a relationship with alcohol that makes us or others unhappy.

I love SD with all my heart. I think it's such a cool place. The kindness people show total strangers is a testament to how recovery can bring people together. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Recently we've been getting more and more interest from media organizations. The truth is, as we grow, we're going to get more and more attention. Online recovery tools, apps, are all booming. 

The mods are in the midst of creating a sort of press package more robust than [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_media).

In reality, the SD members, your stories, encouragement, sharing and kindness are *what makes SD special*. 

**Your experiences are what people are interested in, and as mods, we cannot recreate your experiences or speak for you.**

So we'll do our part and explain the guidelines, community development and history.

So we're asking you, if you want to, let us know about SD and it's impact on you.

**To keep yourself safe when responding, please remember to be mindful of the amount you disclose and what you're comfortable sharing. In theory, media organizations and outlets should be asking for your consent before they use content you share, but this doesn't always happen. [Reddit rules on it here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206630455-Press-Media)**

It's your turn to speak. How did you get here? How do you use SD? What do you like about it? What's your experience with SD?

This thread will be kept up for the weekend, and then it will be linked along with a small press package on the sidebar.

	<TEXT> For me, being drunk felt being better than being sober. 

I would start withdrawing if I didn't drink for 7-8 hours. So it was like...I believed I couldn't stop, because the withdrawals were so nasty. Plus mentally and emotionally I'd be nasty.

It makes rational sense to stop drinking. Like I did a pros and cons analysis, and the only pro to drinking was "Get drunk" but that was SO FUCKING REWARDING that it outweighed alllll the cons.

What happened to me is that I was pretty lucky. I didn't die, I didn't kill myself, and I managed to trick myself into going to rehab under the guise of "I need to get these people off my back, they are so annoying"

I had a very small voice in my head telling me that I might be worth getting sober, and I kind of followed that. In the beginning I just put some things into action (filling out paperwork for rehab, seeing my doctor, making a treatment plan) without actually wanting it.

I think I knew at one point I knew that I was going to want to get help. I just had to wait for that moment. I woke up on May 27th 2011 after my last drunk, and just knew that that was it. I can honestly say 24 hours before this, I would have wanted to drink. 

Since I had planned, albeit unenthusiastically, a treatment plan: I went to rehab on June 1st and haven't looked back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I haven't had PAWS in years. I meant I got hit with anxiety and agitation at my one year celebration. 

I wish I could say that anxiety naturally goes away, but I have a diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Some of my earliest memories involve anxiety. So it's just something I deal with. I've been medication-free for over 1.5 years, and that's huge for me.

Sobriety and lifestyle management make my anxiety infinitely easier to deal with. 

My life is sort of kittens and rainbows though. I say that because I honestly think my life is pretty good, despite the things I struggle with. It's all about perspective and attitude. </TEXT>

When I am agitated, I generally need to move. I find forcing myself to relax is a losing battle. Just my experience.

As for PAWS, it's totally individual. I found that I got hit with PAWS at 3 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and then a huge hit of anxiety at 1 year. Is it PAWS? Is it just the perils of regular human adult life? Who knows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find realizing that I am bored/tired/hangry is the first step. After that, I have a decision. Drinking is a conscious choice, although it always seems automatic as fuck. In between being bored and drinking there is a choice.

So in early days I had a plan if I were to get bored, or tired, or hungry. Then the trick was actually doing it. Because I didn't drink because I was bored, I drank because I wanted to get drunk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I couldn't quit drinking on my own and have a non-miserable life. I needed to work on myself. 

I think addiction has roots in biology, psychology, the social realm, the spiritual realm and the cultural realm. As well as learning and habit playing a huge role.

So I approach my recovery in the same way.

Biologically I detoxed, saw a doctor, drank water, avoided all things with alcohol in them.

Psychologically I talked about my problem with a therapist and with others, I learned how to self-regulate with DBT and mindfulness.

Socially I found new peer groups and dismantled my idealized and romantic view of alcohol.

Spiritually: this has changed and morphed for me. It's been a very personal journey from hardcore atheism to just respecting people and having compassion. 

Culturally I am still figuring out where I fit in.

Long post: but I guess what I am saying is, I had to do stuff to stay sober and live a good life. Not drinking was necessary, but not sufficient, in attaining the results I wanted. </TEXT>

I have been to Cuba, Hawaii, done multiple road trips, long camping trips and am planning a few overseas trips in the next year.

What I can say helps me is connecting with people in a different way when I am there. Getting into the culture and being true to what I value and respect. 

I also pick and choose vacations that aren't meant for partying. In other words, I don't set myself up for failure.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone is allowed to have their opinion. Most of these people are uneducated about the problems that alcohol can cause. 

The reality is, most people don't know what is good or bad for them and just follow what society's fads are. There's a new thing going around facebook that whiskey, honey and lemon juice cure colds. Like, where do I even start with that? 

As for people being careful around me because I am in recovery, I don't make myself look like a victim. I tell people I am in recovery from substance abuse. If someone talks about how wasted they got on the weekend and realize I am there, sometimes I'll get a "Omg sorry I forgot you don't drink." I'll just say "Man, it's all good. It doesn't bug me. Sounds like a fun weekend"

	<TEXT> I know many people who stayed in the industry after they got into recovery. I know I was able to start bartending and waitressing again after some time away. It was never as "fun" again and I ended up changing careers.

At the end of the day, I had to make a decision. Do I want to continue being the party person, or is it time to take some ownership of my health and well-being?

I chose to take care of my health and alcohol problem. I haven't regretted it. Friends and career will always change. I cannot rely on my body regenerating from constant benders. </TEXT>

1. Actually recover. Not like, half way it. Drink sometimes, fuck off sometimes, get angry, get defensive, pretend I was better. Actually get honest, open and willing. Do the work, finish rehab, go to outpatient, do the meetings, cry the tears, talk to my family.

2. Forgive myself. Because no one was going to forgive me if I kept carrying around the shame and guilt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to think that being an "alcoholic" was unfair. I learned that there are way more unfortunate physical, mental and spiritual problems. 

With alcohol, all I need to do is not drink it. It's not like a mental illness in a lot of ways: I don't find there is a lot of everyday maintenance, I can choose to relapse (whereas depression and anxiety sometimes come back without warning).

Substance abuse isn't a cancer. It's not diabetes. It's not a lifelong drudgery that I need to drag my ass through everyday.

I don't drink, and my life is better. How much better I make it is just like anything else in life: interest, motivation and effort. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yah it's more confusing eh? Sometimes it's much easier to stop something when it seems SO out of hand.

You mentioned quitting smoking: think you could transfer any of the skills you learned during that time onto the drinking?

For sleep, it's definitely a bummer. The brain becomes accustomed to getting drowsy from alcohol, so it took me some time before I started to fall asleep on my own. I had to actually put effort into sleep and develop good "sleep hygiene" (it's a thing!). 

I also used a prescribed medication to help me sleep for the first couple months. It was non-addictive, safe and given to me by my psychiatrist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Inpatient didn't cost me anything because of insurance.

Inpatient was a 35 night stay. Daily schedule that needed to be followed. Wake up, go for walk with everyone, breakfast, group check in with team (social workers, addiction counsellors, doctor and psychologist). Then we had either a psychoeducational group or a therapy group. Then lunch, then structured leisure time/activity/sport. Then another group therapy meet. Then dinner, then a nightly check, and then sleep.

We had homework, a couple hours a day to chill and play sports or go for walks/exercise. We had three meals a day, healthy. It was awesome. Best thing I've ever done for myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many find a daily pledge helps.

For me a daily pledge helps now, but I couldn't have gotten sober with just saying the words. I needed to actually do things during the day that guaranteed a safe and sober arrival home.

I did things like fill up my schedule, have zero alcohol in the house, not drive or walk by liquor stores, not go to bars or restaurants, go to meetings, talk to people about my problems and start loving myself and being accountable to me. </TEXT>
