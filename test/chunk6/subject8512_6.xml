	<TEXT> Haha this is amazing, I also got mine for free! My school used to use it, but it was broken, so I got it and fixed it and voila!
I love the 90's aesthetic! I'm more of an 80's synth guy, (Roland Jupiter 8 is my favourite synth ever) but the D-70 sounds like early dos games and similar, which is a little before my time, bet still feels nostalgic!
I haven't used it much yet, but I'll probably be recreating some video game music with it as well as making new tracks in a similar style :)

Why do some not accept transgender people, why do some not believe in evolution, why are so many not capable of learning/changing their views? We need better and more education, we need less materialistic usage of stuffs in a less capitalistic world. We need to take better care of the environment, and we need to accept each other!!
