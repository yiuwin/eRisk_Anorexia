	<TEXT> I've been practicing your deck and it's a lot of fun to play. Nice to get away from the hog/RG meta. Couple questions. Pekka's primary function seems to be countering the RG and turning into a big push but I'm having trouble using him outside of double elixir. Hogs are giving me trouble and with the elixir pump nerf it's not a reliable distraction anymore.

Would you replace pekka with inferno or even mini pekka? Both are great hog and RG counters. Will your deck change with the new balance changes? Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ark is much newer and still needs lots of developing. Rust has its quirks but it feels more fluid and easier to play. It also runs amazingly well on my low end system. Ark raped my PC. I bought ark for $12 in the March monthly humble bundle, it's going to sit in my library until I get a new PC and the game becomes more polished. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great write up, I like the flexibility of the deck. I have a level 3 balloon and I've been looking something like this to use. However all my cards other cards are 1 level lower than yours. Is there a specific one I should prioritize? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boom beach suffers the same fate at around hq16-17. Especially if you're doing well in medals you'll encounter level 50 guys that you have no hope in defeating so you can't really attack anything. Upgrade costs exceed 1 million wood and stone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My PC is significantly worse than yours and I don't have these issues... R9 270x and an i5 2500k, 8gb ram. My frames will drop in and around monuments but in my base or when there's combat around it I'm over 60fps. Settings set to good. I did follow one of the guides for launch parameters and core unparking. It helped a lot. </TEXT>
