	<TEXT> It has a great story, and accurately potreys how fucked people can be, but also how good. It's ignorant of you to say that just because people watch a show like that they have no morals. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about CG3D anime like Gantz:0 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-27 21:11:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have never seen the Gantz anime, but recently watched the movie on netflix. The animation was phenomenal, and the story to me seemed fantastic. My question is what are some other really great CG3D anime movies out there with a similar quality of animation? I don't particularly care about the story as long as it's entertaining, it's just that Gantz 0 was my first experience with that quality of animation, and am now hungry for more. TY </TEXT>
