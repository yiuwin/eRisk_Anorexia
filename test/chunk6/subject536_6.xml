	<TEXT> I'm only 16 and I don't know a lot about who I am and what I like... Right now I try and take things as they come and I work hard in school to have many opportunities later on. This is gonna sound very dramatic of me but I just have this over whelming feeling that there isn't much out there that I'll like; I get bored easily, have a poor attention span, I'm bossy, I suck at making friends, and I am horrible at connecting with people and honestly I have no plans to improve on my personality. Because of this I think my main goal is to not end up alone and to be satisfied with my life. But outside of my obsession with food I'm afraid there's not a lot to me :( Was anyone else like this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ENTP. Though I don't take mbti toooooo terribly seriously, I've always felt like my type would not at all be prone to EDs as an ENTP is supposed to be kind of sporadic, laid back, and easy going. I notice with my type a lot that sometimes ENTPs say they just forget to eat... I wish I had that problem lol. (of course I know there isn't much of a correlation between mbti and mental health). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. I feel so disgusted with myself for this but yeah... Just the other day I was looking at pics of myself from when I was around 5 with some of my friends. I was much smaller than everyone else and my mom goes "You were so tiny" and I felt so much guilt and jealousy towards my past self it was crazy. I wish I was still tiny. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know that being more private will be a resolution of mine, but I can totally relate! Also, I've been a vegetarian for about a year now and I love it! Somehow I never found the ENTP type to sound prone to something like vegetarianism, but I don't know. It's been one of the better decisions I've made in my life! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ohhh yeah I get you. The dark web is pretty much full of criminals and teens with too much time on their hands (like me). it's definitely something an intp would have the skills to navigate for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well yeah but that's not all the dark web is itself. Just because you get on the dark web doesn't mean youre doing anything illegal. You can find illegal things on the regular internet too--doesn't mean you're going to get arrested just for being on the Internet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think you can get in trouble just for associating with the dark web. In fact, I'm almost positive. Many of the things on there are a sham anyway (though not all of it of course). And I somehow feel that's more of an ENTP thing, but I don't know it does seem pretty INTP too I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been looking for someone to do the same actually! If you want, we could exchange emails? I'm an ENTP girl with a distinct lack of critics in my life and Id love to give your stuff a read! </TEXT>
