	<TEXT> TBH it kinda felt like all other reality tv shows. It felt like they were just milking any chance to get a tear jerk or a bad mouth about the other corps. Also felt like they missed out a lot of explaining and details and sorta just jumped around a lot. Hopefully it gets better when tour starts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea but everybody on this thread was just talking about starting Edwards over him? lol I mean i really enjoy him and he is my favorite player but I feel like he might do better at a new team. He has just had a bad defense in front of him everywhere he goes and maybe earl edwards would be able to handle a shaky defense better anyways.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So ive posted something like this before but I kinda want to bring it up again because I notice this happen everytime Bendik is brought up especially when its for a chance to start for the USMNT. Why do people instantly say that he is like one of the worst goalkeepers in the league and that he doesnt deserve a shot. I just dont see him being bad at all. If anything he seems better than 80%-90% of mls keepers and has never once had a shot at USMNT. He always plays in front of a bad defense so its hard to use stats as any sort of indication of his skill level. It's just so frustrating that people call for people like Bingham or Hamid to be called up who I would honestly argue are either on the same level or lower than Bendik and than he is brought up and well this happens https://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/55895l/who_would_you_call_up_to_the_cuba_and_new_zealand/d88r9db?context=3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well from what I was told by a percussion director at a top 6 corps when I was going to audition last year was that they care a lot more about you being able to play the packet well than to mimick their technique. Actually they'd rather teach you their technique over the course of the year so everybody looks more uniform. So if that is true I'd recommend going in their with your best technique that you can produce on your own. Stay relaxed. KNOW the packet 100%. Be able to play every exercise well at all kinds of tempos. Adjust whatever to YOUR technique that you need to so that you can do that. Don't really worry about trying to make your hands look exactly like theirs. That being said, I'd imagine they wouldn't be mad if you came in with hands looking exactly like they teach and being able to play the packet extremely well. So long story short. Prioritize the packet and worry about the way your hands look later. Although the person that told me that isn't roger carter or mike jackson so they might indifferent to that philosophy. 

EDIT: To clarify a little bit. Your hands should at least look pretty damn good when you audition. But I'm saying you shouldn't prioritize making then look exactly like the corps your auditing for since almost all corps play slightly differently. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It just felt like russel was pushing a new narrative there. My theory is that Russell was trying to get gamby to admit to anything cause Russell also refused to admit any blame in that discussion. In fact I don't think he said anything over than "mhmm". Its almost as if he knew he was recording the convo so he was just saying anything to get gamby to talk and then when we didn't he just pretended like he didn't know what gamby was talking about.  I felt like that's where it went from gamby and Russell being in it together to "gamby I can't believe you did all this stuff to Belinda brown" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I mean is that Im 90% sure one of the devs said in one of the Steam discussion chats that they were testing private servers back in august along with full customization as well as new maps. Suddenly 2 months later they said they are just now testing customized apparel for characters and the release date for private servers is "soon". Anybody else feel like they are just stalling with all these tiny patch updates? SIDENOTE: also wtf happened to that soccer gamemode they showed off at e3? is that even planned for PC or is that just their PS4 exclusive that they are releasing before they even finish this version. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean honestly I love the dude but I also have a personal connection with him so theres some bias. I've just noticed that anytime people bring him up for like USMNT candidate or to talk about his play theres like a instant shut down from most people and I dont know why. I think everyone deserves a chance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats not how announcements work my friend. They dont just decide to not announce something cause we are all "pussies". I think youre more worked up than the people who thought it was gonna be announced at the press conference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean I did literally say in the title "I didnt really expect it to be announced today" like if you can read its right there. Im saying in general the lack of communication from rockstar is getting a bit crazy. This is a discussion subreddit right? </TEXT>
