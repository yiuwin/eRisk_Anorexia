	<TITLE> Trying to Compromise on Who Comes for Wedding Dress Shopping </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-01 18:09:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Mini-rant. So, i asked my FMIL to go dress shopping with me. Background: my mom passed away 10 years ago, so unfortunately, i don't get to do the mother/daughter bonding thing. My dad is retired and lives outside of the country, so he can't do it either. So, I thought being my FMIL only has sons, and is really excited about this wedding, id ask her. GREAT! But, she has a ridiculous schedule. She's in Africa on vacay right now, and then comes back, and then goes away again in like a week and a half. So, we managed to book an appointment together March 11th.

Awesome. But then I find my MOH, my best friend, wants to come too. She isnt demanding about it, but i could tell she was bummed because she's going to be away that ONE weekend. She's free every other weekend but of course, FMIL isnt until mid April. We just got engaged and the wedding is in November, so I'm not trying to put shopping off.

After sending a bunch of annoying emails out (i felt like i was being annoying, anyway) trying to reschedule, i instead decided to do one appointment on 3/11 with the FMIL and one 4/1 with the MOH. Is that fair? My MOH felt better about it, but now im worried like...what if i find THE dress on 3/11 and then go...ooops sorry, we arent going 4/1 now?

I definitely have issues with always trying to keep people happy haha i realize this. been my whole life. Im also a planner, so i feel like i want a plan incase i DO have to say "sorry i found the dress." ugh. Im thinking about this WAY too much.

/endrant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We saw 3 venues on Saturday and the 1st one we loved immediately, but of course wanted to give the others a chance. But by the end of the day we knew...the first one was the ONE. We are getting married Nov 18th of this year, the day before my birthday (so exciting!). We are waiting on our contract to be sent over so we can sign, but we are booking [The Pratt House](http://www.pratthouse.com/) on the Upper East Side in NYC (im a born and raised New Yorker, he's from Connecticut). It was built in 1919, has a rich history, and was just beautiful. It felt like "us." So excited to have that done! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is It Possible to Plan a Wedding in 9 months? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-20 03:22:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all, new here. Just got engaged yesterday (eeee!) to my long term boyfriend of almost 5 years. We are already discussing timing, and he and I would love to actually have it early november. Are we insane? Mind you, im a CRAZY planner. Not in a "i get uptight way" just in a "I LOVE PLANNING" way. Always have been that way. Im already making lists of venues, i LOVE planning things. Are we going to be in trouble trying to get a venue we want at only 9 months out? Is it doable or should we realistically give more time? ( we were thinking March 2018 the latest). I assume i have to start looking at places/calling around NOW, which is fine, but are we really getting ourselves into stress city, or can it be done? **EDIT**: Thank you all to your feedback, you've made us feel a lot better about it. We've started reaching out to venues just to see if finding something is even POSSIBLE; and we'll figure it out from there. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Worst bathroom situation ever </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> About a week ago im on my way to to work. I commute by subway a good hour but i know some stops to get off if i need to. Cue cramps and anxiety so i get off at a stop that has a bathroom, pretty rare as most subway stations closed their bathrooms years ago.  Anyway ive gone here no problem at least half a dozen times by this point. But this time there's no toilet paper and i forgot to carry my wet wipes. Cue panic.  Then i realize i have one of those free magazines they sometimes hand out by the entrance to the train.  Yup. I used magazine pages. Not exactly soft and plush.  Lesson learned, i never leave without wipes anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> $2850, for the first floor of a townhouse. 10 min walk to Ditmars. So Second floor is another tenant, and thats it. Our floor was going to be a 3 bedroom, but since its my boyfriend and I, we asked them not to build a wall they were planning on building in one of the rooms to make it 3. So the way it is set up for us, we have 1 bedroom, full kitchen, living room and large dining room. We also have the basement floor to ourselves which is my office; 1 1/2 bathrooms. Garage we share with the upstairs tenant, new washer and dryer, and a parking space. + the courtyard directly outside the building is also ours alone to use. We came from a 1 bedroom in the east village where we were paying $2650 for less than 500 square feet. So for us, this was a huuuuge space upgrade, even if we are paying on the higher end for astoria. </TEXT>

We really need these out, and are trying t sell couch for $200 and desk for $80 but are willing to negotiate. aptdeco links with images are below (prices a little higher here because of the percentage they take to cover delivery, but if you pick up we will sell for less):

	<TITLE> Experience with DHP Futons? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-31 16:50:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> DHP seems to be a brand that pops up on all the major furniture sites like overstock, hayneedle, wayfair etc. The futon in question is this one: http://www.hayneedle.com/product/dhp-brent-futon.cfm?ltype=child tid=AMW982-1

This is meant to be seating in our basement and a way for people to crash if need be; it won't be used nearly as much as our living room couch. But i don't want people to be crazy uncomfortable on it either. We just didn't want to spend too much . on something that's only going to get use once in a blue moon.

Any experiences with this brand? Is it better to get this and a mattress topper, or just spend the $$ on a better futon? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can take my work computer home currently, but I work with larger teams on national clients, and cannot do all my work remotely. I need to be present for internal meetings, client presentations, etc. I am considering moving to freelance though because I work in social media and so I think i could do exactly as you say, work over Skype, and from home easily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ive been on and off diff meds, diff diets, for 4+ years. I mean, i wouldnt solely turn to working from home for IBS; i don't enjoy an office 9-5 and would rather be my own boss. And in my field (social media engagement manager with 6+ years of experience), I can be. I do know going full time freelance is a lot of hustle, however. But, IBS has also pushed me to it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I often consider quitting my full-time job and switching to full-time freelance because my ibs-d can be so debilitating. Like this morning I have a client meeting at their offices and right now I'm sitting on the toilet. I still have about a half an hour before I have to leave but my anxiety has already started and it really depresses me that I even have to think about these things. I do take Imodium and some Fiber to help it but I still have days where I'm thinking well is today the day that it's going to be liquid , is today the day that I'm going to have an accident? The problem is financially I'm not in a great position to quit   stay home. I share an apartment with my boyfriend and I need to pay rent and I don't have enough saved to get me through the next few months yet. Has anyone else dealt with this or made this decision? Has it been worth it for them? I don't think it'll turn me into a hermit, I do love traveling and I love going out with my friends. But to take the pressure off in terms of work and feeling like I can't do my job well I think it would really help my state of mind and just how I deal with things physically. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all! My mom passed away quite a few years ago and I received all her jewelry. There are a few earrings of which I don't know if any gems are real or if they are just costume jewelry. She had some brooches from the 60s and plenty of stuff from the 70s and 80s. Would i have to take these to some place to look at? I live in NYC so if anyone has a suggestion of where ,that would be helpful. I want to sell them, but I don't want to accidentally sell something under value. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How does THAT work? I always assumed running to the bathroom all day every day would cause me to lose weight. Instead i found i had put on 5lbs that i never was able to lose. I've been taking fiber (Heather's Tummy Fiber) and so far, ive only had 1 issue in the past week. I have also lost like 4lbs. Was that just all some weird bloating/retained water from feeling ill? How does having normal BMs actually cause me to lose weight, as opposed to D? I'm more interested in the science of it, if anyone can figure it out! Im certainly not complaining, its just...weird! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So far, so good. Less pain in the mornings. BMs are fully formed, if anything they come out in small round pieces so not perfect. Though randomly on Saturday, i had a normal BM, then suddenly pure liquid, (not even anything in it, like, water)....then a normal BM again. So THAT was weird but i chalk it up to just my IBS being...IBS-y. Otherwise its been good. Im taking half a teaspoon twice a day, morning and evening. Though i did forget to take it this morning so we'll see if thats immediately noticeable or not. </TEXT>
