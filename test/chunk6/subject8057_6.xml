	<TEXT> What DNA are you expecting? DNA evidence is a PITA to recover, and DNA degrades rapidly in the environment. Blood and semen and body parts can have enough to find some DNA evidence, but on a lock?

Good fucking luck. Unless he bled or masturbated on it, it'd be incredibly unlikely he left any DNA evidence on it.

I mean, in principle you can get DNA off of a lot of things from shed skin cells or similar, but in practice, it is a lot harder to recover DNA evidence than you think. Just touching something usually won't leave behind recoverable DNA evidence, which is why they often sweep a lot of stuff for DNA evidence. It is easier to get it from clothing, because clothing is in contact with us for a while and has a nice, rough surface which is good for catching shed skin, as well as getting sweat and other stuff.

But a smooth, metallic surface like a lock isn't likely to hold onto a whole lot, and unless you're handling it regularly...

Another problem is that DNA testing and fingerprint-testing are mutually exclusive on the same object; gathering the evidence for one destroys the evidence for the other.

It should also be noted that they found no DNA evidence of someone else entering his apartment, so by the same token of "But what about his DNA?", you might as well ask about the DNA of his alleged assailants.

The reality is that while CSI is a cool show, real forensic evidence is often a nightmare to collect and even if you go looking you're not guaranteed to find anything.

DNA evidence is very reliable *if you can find it*, but it isn't reliable in the sense that it is easy to get samples. </TEXT>

The report wasn't clear on whether he called the cops for help or to help him nail in the other hand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is extremely difficult to tell if something is a bubble or not in many cases.

The biggest signs of a bubble are when the price of production is not closely related to the price of the thing (i.e. the price of the thing is going up a lot faster than the cost of production is) or when the cost of a mundane good or service is going up much faster than salaries are. However, these sorts of things can be signs of other things (shortages, for instance).

Lots of market speculation is often a bad sign, as are things like low leverage.

I feel like it is a bubble because I don't see the prices as being reasonable, especially if interest rates go up, and because we're seeing a sharp increase in prices similar to what we saw back before the last one. But it is hard to say for sure that it is one.

It could also be a shortage, but there are problems there, too, as if the shortage is alleviated (by, say, building more high density housing within cities, or building more jobs outside of cities because cities are too expensive to do business in), that could result in the market plunging as well.

I feel like some places (Vancouver, BC) are clearly in the midst of a bubble, but other areas appear to be more or less a slow, steady increase rather than the spike. It is hard to say for sure, of course; there's people who make big bucks by anticipating a bubble bursting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is why the BDSM community has the motto of [safe, sane, and consensual,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe,_sane_and_consensual) because some people get carried away and do very stupid and unsafe things.

There's a significant enough community of people who enjoy tying themselves up that not only have I heard of them on the Internet, I've read things written by them and they described some of the things they do in order to make sure that, should they screw up and not be unable to undo their self-bondage that someone will find them (for instance, invite some friends over for a few hours after the bondage session, so if they are still tied up at that point, they can be let out of their restraints).

There are some real horror stories about people who don't do this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is an FPS.

Blizzard makes:

Real-Time Strategy Games (Warcraft, Starcraft)

Action RPG Looters (Diablo)

A MMO (World of Warcraft)

A digital CCG (Hearthstone)

A multiplayer FPS (Overwatch)

Obviously there's overlap between Warcraft and Starcraft, but WoW is a totally different kind of game, and is more like Diablo than Warcraft and Starcraft. Hearthstone and Overwatch are entirely different.

There's a lot of people who play Blizzard games in general, but there's also a lot of people who are RTS fans, or looter fans, or MMO fans, or CCG fans, who have no real interest in Blizzard's other properties.

So it isn't terribly surprising that you get a bunch of FPS people in Overwatch who have zero interest in their other properties.

If you're not a Blizzard (the company) fan, you're unlikely to care. </TEXT>

And really, Warcraft's lore is mostly because of Word of Warcraft. If you've not played World of Warcraft, though, you likely don't care at all. I think something like half the heroes in the game are from that verse.

I'm more interested in Starcraft/Overwatch/Diablo stuff, really, because they're not generic fantasy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> CPI is a bad measure of inflation; it overestimates it.

If you look at actual prices for consumer goods, you'll actually see that there basically hasn't been any inflation at all for a very long time.

How much did stuff cost in 2007?

A new computer? A new video game? A new TV? A new monitor?

The reality is that the price of a lot of goods hasn't really changed much in the last 10 years. Heck, in the last 20 years. This isn't true of everything - the nominal price of some things, like meat and gasoline, have gone up since the 1990s - but the prices of other things, like oil, are down from their 2007 peaks.

The problem is that you're assuming that "inflation" is real. It is nothing more than an observed effect. IRL, most "inflation" in the US is driven by housing prices, education costs, and health care.

The reality is that those homes were grossly overvalued in 2007, and are probably still grossly overvalued today. </TEXT>

Fingerprints usually aren't left behind. People who know anything about the science of fingerprinting know this. Finding usable fingerprints is rare and is a total pain in the ass. Try fingerprinting shit around your house; you'll be shocked how many times you regularly use don't have fingerprints on them.

	<TEXT>  'Liebeck effect' is from the lady that spilled McDonalds coffee on her lap and won huge $$$ from McDonald's. Headlines ran with "Lady spills coffee - wins millions!!" and massive outrage/confusion ensued, however if you dig into the story, the lawsuit and award made a lot of sense.

Actually, the award didn't make sense. This is itself a myth.

The reality is that coffee is normally produced and stored at those temperatures because otherwise the flavor profile of it changes. McDonalds and other places which brew coffee continue to brew and sell it at the high temperatures in question, and indeed, it is the general suggestion for producing coffee and keeping it very hot to avoid said changes in flavor profile before it is served.

Subsequent coffee lawsuits based on the same arguments have failed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, that's trivial - you mostly don't leave usable fingerprints at all.

Fingerprints require good luck to capture. Most things you handle on a regular basis probably don't have any fingerprints which could be captured on them.

Some surfaces are relatively good at capturing them, but most aren't. Fingerprints are very ephemeral things and you don't find them the majority of the time. </TEXT>

 Scotland Yard's inquiry also found no evidence of Williams's fingerprints on the padlock of the bag or the rim of the bath, which the coroner last year said supported her assertion of "third-party involvement" in the death. Hewitt said it was theoretically possible for Williams to lower himself into the holdall without touching the rim of the bath.

This is so worthless. Fingerprints don't show up *all the damn time*. They're actually quite a PITA to capture, and aren't always left behind. From actual forensics data I've read, this seems to happen more often than not. </TEXT>

I find that three vs AI games are enough to propel me from level 1 to level 3, generally, though some super short ones are not; I did a few Sylvanas rush games which were over in like, five minutes.

 Well, you want a new player to feel those lootboxes early and get them hooked.

I do have to say it is neat getting a bunch of lootboxes. Getting that huge pile right off the bat was neat, and it was nice being able to play a level 1 hero and win a vs AI match and get another loot box.

	<TEXT> [As noted here,](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/topic/20754375545) the new xp/hero level in Heroes of the Storm 2.0 is:

* Level 1: 0 XP

* Level 2: 100,000 XP

* Level 3: 250,000 XP

* Level 4: 400,000 XP

* Level 5: 500,000 XP

* Level 6: 600,000 XP

* Level 7: 700,000 XP

* Level 8: 800,000 XP

* Level 9: 900,000 XP

* Level 10: 1,000,000 XP

* Level 11: 1,100,000 XP

* Level 12: 1,200,000 XP

* Additional Levels: 1,200,000 XP

This means that it takes a cumulative total of 1,250,000 XP to go from level 1 to 5, which is almost exactly the same as level 12+ experience.

It was just kind of an interesting way to put it in perspective about how much leveling slows down, as well as how advantageous it is to pick up those early, cheap levels for gold and loot boxes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on how much you play, really. I played back during the late beta, and by the week after it "officially" launched, I'd unlocked 13 heroes in less than two months of playing (out of then 35? heroes, so a bit more than a third of the cast). I religiously leveled all of the free-to-play heroes up to level 5.

I was level 156 when I came back to the game now for this event and tried picking it back up.

I'm level 170 now, have 33/65 heroes between the bundle and various other things, and have 12k gold to buy more stuff.

I'm not sure how important unlocking the whole roster is, though; it would be nice, but I've got a lot of choices as-is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Frankly, Blizzard doesn't care about the assholes who get butthurt. They don't "have" to do it, it is because there is something deeply wrong with them as people. They're sick in the head. Doing something that makes them miserable for hours to unlock something in a game is a sign that there's something wrong with you and that you need to re-evaluate your life.

Their goal is to get extra people in the game. The "ill will" comes from people who are already horrible anyway, so it is unlikely to really matter at all.

The goal is to get people like me to take another poke at HOTS (because they gave me a whole bunch of stuff for getting to level 156 back in the beta) and thus hopefully keep us around and get us to spend money (a futile effort with me) or at least provide content for the whales. </TEXT>

Everyone who is throwing games is a horrible person. It's just reality.

The thing is, Blizzard enabled horrible people. You never want to do that.

Really, why are you playing HOTS if you hate it?

Answer: your brain is broken. Any answer you give is an obvious, immediate malfunction.

The reality is that you're making yourself unhappy for an hour or two for no reason whatsoever. You could be doing something fun instead, but instead you're wasting your time doing something stupid. You'd be better off just playing Overwatch for loot boxes. </TEXT>

You're wrong. That isn't the point at all.

The goal of cross-promotional events like this is to get players to try out a game they wouldn't have tried out otherwise, with the hope that they realize they like that game as well and keep playing it.

They want to make it a good experience for people. Moreover, by basically bribing them with stuff, they encourage them to keep playing both games. Indeed, that's why they've got four weeks of challenge, and that's why one of the rewards is a stimpack - to encourage Overwatch players to keep playing HOTS.

The problem is that they fucked up. They probably should have made it all vs AI, or just had the first three vs AI and the last one involved actual PvP, and required them to win, say, three games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they're only a level or two ahead of you in that situation, the game is actually very winnable. One won teamfight and your team will be able to get the boss or counterpush or whatever and probably get a keep of theirs and get close to equalizing the level gap (or at least put it to one), or possibly win an objective (which can potentially just outright win you the game in that situation on some maps).

There used to be maps like Haunted Mines where there were "lost" games, but I think all of the maps now don't have such auto-damage type things.

Realistically speaking, the only time a game is really "lost" before it is over is when you've got several dead heroes and they're bearing down on you with an objective or a boss. Wiping the enemy team in a teamfight, or at least killing 3-4 of them, is a pretty huge turnaround late-game and can lead to a really dangerous push. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, you're bending over backwards to try and claim that two things which aren't equal are equal.

I pointed out the flaws in this in several ways - that rich people don't serve shorter jail sentences despite earning more income (their time is more valuable) and that older people don't serve shorter jail sentences than younger people (despite the fact that it makes up a larger fraction of their remaining lifespan).

Indeed, you seem to not even understand the purpose of punishment in the first place.

Prison is not done to "take away people's income". The very premise is completely, totally, and utterly wrong.

When we put people in prison, it is a combination of punishment (they have to sit in time out) and to protect society from a criminal for a given timespan (as it is very difficult to commit crimes outside of a jail from inside one).

It has nothing to do with denying people income. Zero. Nothing. Nada. That's a side effect of the punishment, but it is not its *purpose*.

Thus, this argument is wrong on the face of it. It has no validity whatsoever.

Indeed, that was what I was getting at by pointing out that a rich person getting a shorter jail sentence than a poor person because their time is more valuable (which, I'll note, is also "equality" - equal *value*). According to your logic, we should put rich people in jail for less time than poor people, and unemployed people should be put in jail for longer. Someone who produces more value with their time is more costly to remove from society than someone who produces less of it. Indeed, it is obviously unjust to put them in jail for the same amount of time, because they're losing more value!

The reality is that this entire thought process is wrong from beginning to end. The purpose of imprisonment is not to deny people income, it is to deny them access to society so that they cannot commit their crimes again.

Fines are likewise assigned on the severity of the offense. Speeding isn't a very severe offense; fraud is. That's why you pay much larger fines for fraud than speeding. The fine is relative to the damage/danger. A rich person and a poor person illegally parking somewhere are doing the exact same amount of damage, so the fine should be equal because the damage is the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The system, as-is, assigns equal penalties to everyone. This is fair - if you commit a crime, it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, you are hit with the same penalty. Same monetary penalty, same time in jail.

It is difficult to argue that exactly the same thing for everyone is unfair - if you do X, you get Y result. And indeed, this is how things are supposed to be - penalties are supposed to be relative to the *crime*.

If you believe that people should be sentenced differently based on income levels, then you are saying that it should be legal to penalize poor people more heavily than rich people, because it is using the exact same logic of relying on some other concept of equal other than equal.

The fact that one person has more money than another person does not mean that they should be penalized any differently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How is that "more equal"? The fine is supposed to be relative to the magnitude of offense. Someone who is 20 and goes to jail for 20 years is going to get out when they're 40; someone who is 70 and gets sent to jail for 20 years is likely going to die in jail.

Does that mean that older murderers should be given lesser sentences?

I'm using the exact same logic as you, but applying it from a different angle.

The reality is that penalties are supposed to be proportional to the offense. Someone being rich or poor and getting a different sentence as a result is seen as unjust when a poor person gets a greater sentence than a rich person. Why would the reverse be any more just? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Can someone who makes $10k/yr sue the City because a $400 fine for them is astronomically more of a punishment and imposition than a $400 fine on Elon Musk?

No, because it is the same sentence. A sentence is supposed to be relative to the magnitude of the crime. Getting a 20 year jail sentence when you're 20 means you get out when you're 40. Getting a 20 year jail sentence when you're 70 means it is likely you're going to die in jail.

If you got charged $40,000 for the same offense as someone got charged $40 for, you'd have a real case for a violation of the equal protection clause.

If you commit fraud, should you be fined less because you lost all the money you stole from other people?

 Fines from violations only encourage the government to create more regulations for its citizens to violate, and they're used as potent weapons against poor communities and communities of color across the country.

Fines exist to try and discourage certain behavior. The fact that people use them as revenue-making schemes is problematic, but the reality is that enforcing traffic laws is important.

Moreover, the whole "weapons against poor communities and communities of color" is not true. The reason why such areas tend to enact more fines is because they need to pay for government services and people refuse to pay more taxes (and indeed, the tax base in such areas is often shitty to begin with). Thus, you end up with fines, which people are generally less opposed to, because shit needs to be paid for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  See: all the deaths for cannabis: 0

Protip: it is trivial to use Google to find out that this is false. The only people who make this claim are, I'm afraid, potheads.

First off, it is indeed possible to die from consumption of cannabis/THC; while for a long time there weren't any reported deaths as a result of such, in recent years they've become much more common (though still rare). About a score of deaths are reported per year now as a result of consumption of products containing THC and having a bad medical reaction, with a higher number (somewhat north of 100) recorded as a result of mixing marijuana with other substances, primarily alcohol (as marijuana and alcohol can have certain cumulative effects). AFAIK, all of the deaths from THC alone have involved extracts and edibles rather than smoked marijuana; it would be very difficult to smoke a lethal dose of THC (it would take hundreds of joints within a very short period of time). You'd probably die of other causes related to smoke inhalation before you died from the THC if you tried to smoke that much pot.

But people do nevertheless die.  [Here's a paper from 2014 documenting two such deaths.](http://www.fsijournal.org/article/S0379-0738(14)00054-1/abstract)

A secondary cause is erratic behavior caused by consumption of cannabis. One of the more common side effects is anxiety, and there are recorded deaths ([such as this one](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6428a6.htm)) which were caused by people's erratic behavior after consuming cannabis or THC. There's evidence that THC can trigger or worsen psychological disturbances, and as such, so any deaths resulting from such would be in part attributable to the consumption of THC.

Consumption of cannabis/THC is also associated with criminal behavior in much the same way as alcohol is; this isn't terribly surprising if you think about it, as both impair judgement. People who commit crimes are disproportionately likely to be under the influence of cannabis relative to the general population, indicating that at least some deaths as a result of crime have THC as a contributing factor.

Thirdly, there's accidental deaths. Cannabis is second to only alcohol in terms of appearance in fatal car crash victims. While some studies have claimed that this is due to the age of the victims, this is somewhat problematic because the causation can run the other way - i.e. younger drivers are more likely to get in crashes *because* they're more likely to abuse cannabis, and thus some of the risk factor from being a young driver is actually not from being young, but from more young people abusing cannabis. Studies have found that cannabis does significantly impair driving, and for longer than alcohol, though the acute impact is smaller (i.e. you are a worse driver for longer, but it impairs driving ability by less). It has also been found that mixing alcohol and cannabis results in greater impairment than would be expected by naive addition of their effects.

Fourth, the long-term health effects of marijuana are not well-known, but it probably kills a lot of people in the long run. No one has ever died from a nicotine overdose from a cigarette, but hundreds of thousand of people die premature deaths as a result of the long-term health effects of smoking each year. The same is true of alcohol consumption as well - the number of deaths from the immediate effects of alcohol are dwarfed by the deaths in the long term. There's no reason to believe that marijuana is any less toxic in the long term than smoking tobacco or drinking; it is known to cause brain damage in its heaviest users, something alcohol does, and inhaling smoke is certainly not good for your lungs. It may cause other forms of organ damage as well, given it can alter bloodflow to the organs and that it is a toxic substance which the body has to metabolize. Professor John Henry has estimated that the long-term health effects of cannabis consumption in the UK kill about 30,000 people per year, or about a quarter as many people as die from smoking tobacco.

It is hard to know how accurate these figures are, though; unfortunately, a lot of marijuana users also use other drugs (particularly tobacco and alcohol), which makes it more difficult to disentangle the health effects of cannabis consumption from those of other drugs. Additionally, as marijuana is an illegal drug, its usage is more difficult to track.

However, it is highly probable that the long term negative health effects of marijuana kill a lot of people each year.

Of course, there are things beyond deaths to consider; side effects are another major area of concern, and cannabis has serious side effects from the point of view of medical usage, impairing ordinary function.

Obviously, Big Pot will lie and claim that marijuana is safe, just like Big Tobacco claimed that smoking cigarettes was safe. The reality is that marijuana is a fairly powerful psychoactive drug and only fools would believe it is safe. There's not any evidence suggesting that it is safe to use, and quite a bit which suggests that it isn't.

I'm in favor of marijuana legalization, but marijuana is not harmless, and everyone who claims otherwise is ten times worse than the Big Tobacco folks, because we know better now. </TEXT>

*Number* of years of education beyond, say, middle school, is another kettle of fish; people who have more years of education generally earn more on average (I forget the exact correlation, but it is pretty high). That said, there's not good evidence that education when children are very young (pre-kindergarten) makes a difference in long-term outcomes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  First, teachers educate our children, often protect our children, are trusted with our children, yet we pay them less than many other occupations.

The median teacher salary is actually better than the median salary in the US. Additionally, teachers get a considerable amount of non-wage compensation in the form of pension plans, insurance, and other such benefits. Teachers work about 75 days a year less than other professions, which means that their salary and benefits are being granted for roughly 30% fewer work days.

Teaching positions are fairly heavily sought after, which is part of why teachers have erected barriers to entry in teaching - interestingly, certifications appear to have little influence on actual quality of teaching.

The idea that paying people more money gets better results is simply wrong anyway; [studies have failed to find that increasing pay or giving incentives for performance improves performance.](https://hbr.org/1993/09/why-incentive-plans-cannot-work) This makes sense if you think about it; why *would* it?

 I'm pro arts related programs such as theater, band, etc. Schools tend to cut these first as "unnecessary" but to be well rounded, they are very necessary. 

It makes sense to cut them first, because they are less necessary and often require additional expenses. And indeed, a lot of art classes do little to improve students' artistic abilities, unfortunately.

Cutting administrative staff should come first, though; schools have excessive amounts of it.

 It's a mixed bag and I get why those that can often send their children to private school.

There isn't really much evidence that private schools give a higher quality of education.

Of course, the impact of schools on outcomes are surprisingly small. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  4) I made no allegations about minority voters. Not once. Please re-read my original post.

I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I was saying that Republicans say the same thing about poor minority voters as you're saying about poor white voters. And they believe it, too.

 They prefer Republican for a multitude of reasons including, their family's allegiance to the party, the candidate is often white, the candidate makes claims about "moochers" of the system often blaming a minority group, and more absurd reasons.

You're leaving out a number of important reasons and only listing the ones which are most negative. That's a bit unfair, I think.

I'm not saying that poor white people should vote for Republicans, but I think that the argument that they're being tricked into voting with such diversions is something a lot of people like to believe because a number of the true reasons are a lot more intractable. That's not to say that lies have no influence on their vote, but I think that you're putting outsize importance on a number of issues.

One thing you didn't list: they don't like people who talk down to them, and they feel like a lot of Democrats do exactly that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a Democrat. But I think you should probably reexamine many of your assumptions.

1) Voting should about how you think the country should be run, not what is in your own personal selfish interest and screw everyone else. Just because something is against your own selfish interest (at least superficially) doesn't necessarily mean you don't think it is correct.

2) If you do believe that people should only vote in their own selfish interest, you cannot complain about rich people or fundamentalist Christians voting for Republicans.

3) The assumption that all voting for Republicans by poor people is purely driven by non-issues and fear, and not educated reasoning, is not true - there are reasons why they prefer the Republicans to the Democrats in many cases.

4) Republicans make the exact same allegations as you do about minority voters, and they are exactly as condescending.

5) The assumption that most people in the country make decisions based on any sort of rational decision-making process is quite wrong. Most Democrats don't vote based on "educated reasoning" either. If we only allowed people to vote based on "educated reasoning", we wouldn't have many voters. </TEXT>

 The national academies of Science, engineering, and medicine has compiled much more conclusive information than just fda based information. In fact they've included the fda information in their results. And still there is only moderate evidence to suggest problem cannabanoid use will form. Whereas they know for a fact cannabis can be use to treat chronic pain.

Except they don't.

The reason why we have double-blinded clinical trials is to prove that the drug is more effective than placebo and to look for undesirable side-effects. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Social security is simultaneously progressive and regressive. It is progressive because it replaces a larger fraction of income for lower income people than it does for higher income people, and regressive because eventually how much you pay into social security is capped.

It is redistributive because in the end, it ends up benefitting poor people more than rich people relative to what they paid in - depending on how you measure it, they net a benefit of somewhere between 5 and 13%.

This isn't a bad thing, mind you - it is part of the design intent of the system. </TEXT>
