Dick in, dick out, I can do that while you're asleep and you may never know, even if you do it wouldn't go past you getting mad at me.

In Brock Turner's case, it was the media talking about it everywhere what wore her down, it became public and that drove her crazy. Privacy does wonders.

And why isn't it bad if they are unconscious? Well, what traumatic experiences are they getting? What flashbacks? There's nothing to remember so, it shouldn't be hard to get over it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At least for me, ranking Super Strike characters gets tricky given their nature. Easy to get and farmable SA, there may be better pullable alternatives to them, but these are still naturally stronger at SA 15 than low tier characters. Links may be limited, but they work like beating sticks, with some additional effect, except for Trunks he's garbage. 

So I'll try to speak well about the ones I consider could get a promotion. 


STR Tao is one of the few decent STR villains. Surprisingly high stats, excelent passive and a low ki stun. He's surely beaten into the ground if compared to SSJ3 Vegeta, but it's still a worthy unit with damage on par with TURs if his passive procs. Better than Rildo or at least Bojack, both A tier. 

TEQ Jackie Chun is another good one. Really high damage coming from  farmable SA and a 20% increase while doing it. But the main appeal is his Super seal. There's already TEQ SSJ Bardock, but 
both could be used on a Mono-TEQ team to be safe. But considering Murasaki is on the Tier list for being the only AGL sealer, maybe you value a lot having alternatives, Bardock existing means Jackie isn't necessary. But he's still kinda good.

Both PHY Mecha Frieza and AGL Vegeta are hard hitters, I usually found myself hitting for over 100k with them under double Gogeta lead, haven't tried with God Leaders. They are some of the biggest hit sticks a free player can get. 

AGL Vegeta does have a lot of competition and Pikkon is better suited for a Vegito team, I can get him being low tier, but I'd argue for Mecha Frieza as S tier; big damage AND his SA lowers enemy ATK, could be the Pikkon of Mono-PHY teams trading Shocking Speed for raw power. Besides, he has low ki requirement, so he compensates for his lack of Ki links. But seriously, I'm still surprised at that damage.

Haven't maxed my Mighty Mask but I can at least tell that he's the absolute best, for Broly Dokkan event. Both blazing battle and being able to greatly reduce defense is a bless. Some people also said he hits really hard at 15, so there's that. Should be at least A for being the best unit given for that one boss, and go to S if we ever get a double-boss Dokkan event, that passive is strong.

Android 16 has a really good passive and his SA 15 gives him an attack boost since he isn't linking with anyone... I guess he can go up a tier when an INT GOD leader comes out, right now he isn't worth a spot outside of Mono-INT teams, but there are no reasons to run Mono-INT.


Also, I'm still bitter about Champa, as he has only one unreliable gimmick. That ATK boost may not even happen at all, but even assuming he does it one time every battle, it's not enough. You're hindering your team just by putting him there since he offers no links and has no passive. For example, by using Mecha Frieza instead of him, you'll probably make up for that 200% SA in 2 or 3 supers. Way more consistent, since those happen every turn.

	<TEXT> Now that I think about it... it will be pretty broken.

You can use Babidi, General Blue AND Bulma, all three are INT type and have the highest stun rate. 

With double GOD leader, you are already at a high HP level so don't worry, and then you fill with your strongest INTs. That may include Demigra, another stunner.

Maybe change that Bulma for Demigra so your team doesn't suffer that much. Pretty much a viable perma-stun team </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Now that I think about it, next event should cover Majuub's and SSJ4 Goku's battle against Baby. 

We already have gacha Majuub and final Baby Vegeta, we're only missing his giant monkey form. We're probably gonna get medals to dokkan last event's Baby into a TUR, since his stage 2 is already in the game and I doubt they'll leave his evolution line unfinished (and he's not gacha material)

So, that's one possible free unit, a TUR Baby Vegeta stage 2. But what about a new farmable character?

What's left of Baby saga is pretty straightforward, only Majuub, SS4 Goku and Golden Ape Baby are relevant, and I don't see the last 2 being farmable. 

So, maybe we won't get a Majuub rebirth, and they'll instead create a much better farmable one. 

Or they could do both. Farmable Uub with medals to dokkan him into Majuub, and those same medals could dokkan the STR one! 

Now that I think about it, they could also give a Golden Ape Goku </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still depressed about Bandai's hate for non-saiyans 

They just had to make Hit a featured character (again) on the banner and not give him a rebirth even though this was his saga...

But not only that, they didn't learn anything from it and introduced Champa, another BIG letdown.

He may be useful on Broly teams, actually, he may be the hardest hitter if his passive activates under double broly lead... but that's very specific. 

Outside of it, it's very hard to work him into a team, it's better to replace him with someone who has links.

Only hope is that they make an U6 dokkan event, giving rebirths to Hit, Champa and a dokkan to Frost.

About Frost, it's ridiculous that all of his forms are SR, at least the final one should have been SSR.

But that third form is one of the best SRs for a beginner, high attack and good passive </TEXT>

But I guess it's not all for nothing, lots of people still think that rape for power is a myth. I always like to shed some light on it, since I can clearly differentiate the urges. 

Disgusting is not the right word, it's just fucked up, equal to getting really angry at a dude and wanting to break his legs. 

Rape is the ultimate weapon to break someone, that piece of information should be available to everyone. Some may use it for evil and some for good. The awareness, not the action of raping. 

It's not always about just pleasing the peen, I can't stand how rape is often portrayed as such a petty thing, it's very complex with a lot of thought put into, an action worthy of the best villains. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kite would have won with serious injuries, if he doesn't die he gets kidnapped and the arc plays out pretty much the same. Pitou was full of scratches and impressed by the fight... those same attacks which left her lightly injured would have probably killed her without a Nen armor. 

But about Kite getting that injured even if he wins, it's because don't trust Nen enough to physically protect a human from attacks coming from an alien who can travel a kilometer in just one leap 

Netero wouldn't have sacrificed himself. Remember, at first Meruem was really passive just sitting there and one hit from Netero draw some blood. 

Blood... from freakin Meruem... on just one hit? Compared with what whe saw in their fight, it's obvious that he was unprotected. In fact, we see him activating his aura when Netero finally convinces him to fight; he didn't have Ren at first. 

The arc would have ended with less casualties, but the Royal Guards without Nen are on par with top tier hunters. Say, instead of dying from one direct hit from Youpi, it would be like getting punched by a full-force Hisoka; it still hurts a ton, but it ain't certain death.

Meruem would be on Netero's level, the old man is still the only one who can fight him. Would have won after losing a limb, by then instead of feeling light pain, Meruem would be almost dead.

And even assuming he survives long enough to figure out the pattern, Zero hand disintegrates him. That way Netero loses his powers and the Chairman election still happens.

	<TEXT> Villains links are pretty much restricted to their own sagas... or even worse, limited to their very own characters. Frieza, Cell, Buu, they only link with their own transformations. 

That's as ridiculous as Gokus only linking together or something like that. 

Fear and Despair is a link which pretty much applies to all villains so, important villains without it need TURs to get that one. Of course, only linking for 2 ki is still bad.

Talking about that, it's more that their links are bad. Too much atk and no ki. STR Bojack comes to mind.

They are badly designed since birth. 

Ironically, GT is headed in the right direction I believe, kinda. They're the most decent villain team, Baby cards link wonderfully and you can throw Broly in there... but then you might as well go full Saiyan.

If Bandai was really going for the whole "Villains are selfish" thing, they should double their passives or something to make up for the lack of teamwork.

For example, an 100% ATK Baby Vegeta if over 50% hp would be "strong" but with current links, it wouldn't even be broken.

Seriously increasing their passives would make them individually strong and it'd make them at least somewhat usable.

Also, I'd add a new link for Rebirth villains, +5000 or 20% ATK on Super. They really lack burst. 

You said no changing current links, but Big Bad Bosses was already improved since it was trash. It should change one more time, no HP restriction. 

There's also the whole no good leader. Raditz would have been good as a leader 8 months before, those 3 ki aren't even helping anymore. 

And I'm really, REALLY mad in general. If I have fielded some of the most emblematic villains in DB history why aren't they at 30-40k ATK throwing Supers everywhere!?!?!?!?

Right, because that restriction needs to end. There are Bojack team links, Android 17   18 links, Friezas only linking with his family, Cell only links with his AGL self, Buu is the same...

Heroes usually have that as a gimmick. For example Bardock sharing 1 link with Goku but making up with something else to be included in a team without him.

On villains those gimmick links are usually their only links </TEXT>

He's got to be one of the most useless "strong" cards. People usually talk as if he was really good but he hits like a SR, it'd need at least 2 or 3 turns of supers to start hitting like a normal character.

	<TEXT> Hit is probably one of the worst SSRs out there.

Yeah, he may have TEQ Whis passive, but that would take him from B to A. He's really not something you want to use, Strike characters are better. Unless his Stun chance is close to 100% and he does it for 2 turns and not just current one, then you could cheese bosses with double gogeta lead

His links are pretty much limited to SRs and not good ones at that. Cold Judgement is the one with more SSRs, and it's 300 atk.

I guess... if he's your only SSR.. you could pair him with farmable Cabba for 2 ki.

Honestly, that U6 Tournament Warrior link shouldn't have been created. It's not even a "Super" link, it's limited to that one saga.

New Super characters won't even have it. </TEXT>

I love that type because I like villains -and I have them-, but their links are just so bad. Even with the finest villains you'd probably have trouble supering without a Ki leader. 

I'm like "Oh great, I have all these SSR Int villains! They're so strong!"... but they don't really work as a team.

Yes I'm frustrated and looking at you Bandai! I have Perfect Cell, Janemba, Baby Vegeta 2, FF Frieza, Nappa, King Vegeta, Android 16 and FF Cooler!!!!
