	<TEXT> I agree with this advice. The expats have to go somewhere. If you can find out where they work (such as an embassy) it could be possible for you to reach them at their work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To me it sounds like you want to create something, but for some reason something is holding you back. 

I feel the same way. I think one way to overcome this is to find one or two people who want to go in on your business with you. This gives you the motivation of knowing that you aren't going at it alone. 

If I were you, I would find friends, or even people here on reddit who would be interested in starting a business with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn ads are the most successful for campaigns that we have run. LinkedIn is incredibly targeted because you can narrow your list to specific job titles, companies, years experience, etc. 

LinkedIn may be a good place for you to target entrepreneurs who don't have coding skills. My best bet for your business would be LinkedIn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a marketer, so I have done a bit with email marketing. 

Based on that subject it just seems like you are fishing, throwing your line out there and hoping somebody bites. 

While it is awesome that you have a list of 60,000 emails of college students, how many do you think are truly interested in building a website? Are they from all different majors? 

If they are from a bunch of different majors, I would even suggest doing some advertising on Facebook or LinkedIn to find a more niche audience. 

But what I might do is offer a promo code in your next email saying that people can get 30% off their purchase if they purchase within the next 10 days. 

Then just have a link ready for them to start building their website.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Assembling team of wantrepreneurs </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I love the idea of having my own company and not working under somebody else. However, the idea of investing into an idea can be frightening. 

I have always wanted to connect with other people who have great ideas, but who are a little hesitant to get the ball rolling, like myself. 

I want this to be a place where wantrepreneurs can come together and team up to actually achieve their dreams instead of just talk about it. 

Share your ideas below - if you like them and want to be involved, PM the OP and start working together to finally build something instead of daydream about it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you don't mind me asking, what was your subject line and what were you offering them in your email? If there wasn't something of extraordinary value, then most likely people just ignored your email. 

Subject lines and the first line of your email can make the biggest difference in getting people to actually open the email.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, I was being sarcastic about CP3. I really don't see this being a close finals. As you can see tonight, the Warriors have too much depth. 

The Cavs will never beat a healthy Warriors team in the finals as they are currently constructed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We paid about $400 an hour, split among four of us, so it ended up being $100 per person. We heard there was an area where we could get it for $300 an hour, but our Spanish wasn't quite good enough to get us that deal. 

I think you could get it for $300 an hour if you go back next time! </TEXT>
