	<TEXT> I already took the b18c out of the integra and swapped it into the civic. Now its time to harvest the remaining parts for the civic and sell the rest to pay for the swap.

What do you guys think I should do for couplers and wheels on the civic? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  begin the tear down phase of the project. The Integra GSR was a donor and is being harvested of all the parts I can salvage for the 97 Honda Civic hatchback project car. I will eventually pull the suspension and other exterior bits but spent today pulling all interior items that I can sell on ebay to pay for the whole swap. The goal is to recoup all of the cost of the b18c swap by parting out the GSR shell and strip it bare.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, this is how I find the used book store dumpsters every single time I swing by... Its sad and at least they try to recycle. Makes me want to open a library or something, I just dont understand the amount of waste and need to reprint over and over. Capitalism at its finest.

I've found some really cool vintage copies that I keep on my bookshelf from these places let alone the music cds and movies in the actual dumpster </TEXT>
