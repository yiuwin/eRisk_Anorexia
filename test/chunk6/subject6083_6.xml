	<TEXT> Yeah. Snap TV already makes the game volume a bit lower altogether; the focus is what's on TV. But the crowd is still really loud, especially playing at home; whenever you make a basket the crowd goes crazy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With my Xbox One, I snap TV a lot. Since Microsoft hasn't made it possible yet to mute the game, I go in settings and realized you can't completely mute the crowd. You can mute commentary, sound effects, etc.

Anyone with Xbox One feel the same way? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're both guys, 18-19 years old.

We have been going to the same school for 7 years, this is the last.

We used to be the best of friends the first 3-4 years. Then something happened, time passed, and we're just not good at conversations together. AT ALL

Get this. He says something or brings up a topic, I have to think **really** hard to keep up the flow. I say something or bring up a topic, most of the time he replies "Oh... That's good." And that's the end of it.

I'm not the type of person who thinks silence is awkward, but with him, I just don't enjoy my time anymore.

At school, whenever he sees me, he always tries to have a conversation with me. I don't push him away or anything, in fact I'm very welcoming. He has other friends but I'm always his first choice and it's really annoying.

In the past month and a half, he's asked me 6 times to hang out. I always had legitimate excuses as to why I can't, but what do I do the day I'm free?

I left my phone downstairs for 10 minutes last week. When I came back to it, 5 missed calls. Guess who? I called him back, he wanted to hang out, I had plans unfortunately, or fortunately, however you wanna look at it.

I feel like a dick. This has been going on for about two years.

And he's not interested in me, for those who might think he's gay hahaha </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Long story short, near the end of last semester, I asked a girl for her number, telling her we should do something over the month long Christmas break we had.

I texted her at some point in there; it ended with us wishing each other a merry Christmas. I didn't text/call her again. I was more inclined to spending time with my guy friends or by myself over the break. I feel bad nonetheless.

This semester started last week. I ran into her once: I was in a rush so I just said hi and we parted ways. Next time, what should I do? Do I apologize? I'm not very good at this but I'm open to anything! I always had a feeling she liked me.

We're both 18-19. </TEXT>

That's it.

I don't care if you only score 70 points. I don't care if you lose by 50. You will get 3 stars if you get 20 assists. And if you're at least decent, you'll have 20 by the end of the 3rd already.

	<TEXT> My guy friends still invite me over to all of their hangouts, but I feel and know for a fact I'm the weakest link. It makes me feel bad, but their hangouts are always a fun time so I always go.

Also, I was in love with some girl two years ago, who thought we were just best friends. I told her, we stayed friends. Something I didn't even cause happened in the past 6 months. She never contacts me now. The rejection hurt but I got over it, and she knows I got over it. She was someone I could tell anything to and she's just not in my life anymore even though we still go to the same school. Sucks but what can I do. If I contact her she'll just think it's another attempt at "getting her."

So at the moment I don't really have any supportive people in my life, in terms of close friends. I'm alone, but I'm pretty happy. I keep a positive outlook since I'm going into university next year. It'll be a nice change of scenery and I hope I'll get to meet new people.

Rereading what I just wrote, I realize i'm such an insecure person. I project a lot of confidence in my daily life but on the inside I need attention hhahaa </TEXT>
