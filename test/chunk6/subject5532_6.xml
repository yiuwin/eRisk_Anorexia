	<TEXT> It doesn't really matter if there's a slight difference between PS4 and Xbox One, and I can't even see how that would be the case anyway because they use very, very similar controllers. Although xbox may be the least skilled, as you say, by no means would it be as big a leap between PS4 and PC. I find it hard to believe cross platform for PS4 and Xbox would probably not even be noticeable in terms of skill differences between players.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes but in order for Sony to be convinced Blizzard need to actually pursue implementing it. Additionally, although the title says Blizzard, if you look at the petition it's addressed to Blizzard, Sony and Microsoft. All 3 need to be on board. Sony can say yes, but the question needs to be asked by Blizzard first.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's a combination of a couple of things. For one, I think Blizzard have to commit to wanting to implement it. From there, they have to get Sony and Microsoft on their side. That's why the petition is addressed to all 3. Although there is a lot of confusion as to who is in favour of crossplay. Sony used to be, but apparently no longer are. It's the opposite of microsoft.


Honestly I think it's a case by case thing and nobody has the answers yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It keeps people playing the game for longer. People will commit more time to the game, and potentially spend more on things like Loot Boxes. People who haven't got the game because they can't play with the friends who have a different console might go out and get it if cross-play becomes supported.


It basically increase the game's longevity, which will probably increase profits too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it will keep people playing the game. And that's 100% Blizzard's main goal at the moment. Keep people playing, make them buy loot boxes. People are clearly taking the bait with loot boxes, and over time they can add more skins and such to keep people buying them. The only problem is that the console versions could die off (whereas that's unlikely for PC) and cross platform play could stave that off and keep people playing for longer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The most interesting part of the article IMO. 

In a muddy field, Jon Snow is fighting a dozen men. His costume has changed (Purely for merchandisingnow everybody has to buy a different doll, he jokes), and his wild hair is partly pinned up, out of the way, almost like a samurai. The actor is a whirlwind. Harington swings his sword this way, that way, stepping and spinning, ducking and stabbing, delivering a complex series of fight moves faster than you would think is possible. And as exhausting as this is, Harington always wants one more take.
Hes become phenomenal at it, Benioff says. Theres something great about watching Kit do a 60-second take where hes actually doing all the moves. Weiss drily agrees: He might actually be of serious value in a medieval army.
Harington takes the physical part of his job as seriously as he does protecting the shows secrets. Hes able to pick up a 14-beat fight in minutes, and when he briefly removes his shirt he reveals an intricately chiseled physique. (Cunningham quips, Hes just doing that to annoy the rest of us.) Harington will later share a photo of his bathtub full of brown water from all the dirt that comes off him after a day of battle.
Yet even the toughest heroes cant handle dozens of enemies by themselves. During one scene, Jon Snow is overwhelmed, and he goes down swinging. Fighters pile atop him. Harington is pressed into thick, soupy mud and crawling bugs. Jon Snow came back from the dead once, but if he perishes again, one shouldnt expect him to be saved a second time.
Harington refuses to say his safe word (banana) to stop the pummeling. But when the scene ends, he seems more winded than usual. The Game of Thrones star staggers away, giving a weary smile:  Become an actor, they said... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some highlights from the article:

 There was one loose thread that gave Harington hope that Snow would continue in some form: Ned Starks bastard son never learned his mothers identity. His characters parentage has been one of the biggest mysteries hanging over the shows mythology. Why would there be this whole arc about your mother if that was never going to be relevant information because you died before finding out? he wondered.
And then, between camera setups, Benioff and Weiss asked Harington to go for a walk.
Harington recalls feeling nervous. He knew what this conversation was about, as did everybody else on the set  this is what an actors dismissal looks like. But for months afterward, only the three of them would know what was truly said.
Once certain nobody was within earshot, Harington says Benioff told him this: Me and Dan, we know this, a couple producers know this, and George knows this. Now youre going to know this  and you cant tell anybody. Not your mom, not your dad, not your family  not anybody. You cant tell anybody.
Okay, Harington said.
You are back next season, the producer told him. You are alive. Melisandre brings you back. And youve got a sload to do next season. Youre going to be doing a lot.
Harington felt a surge of relief. I was incredibly happy, he recalls.
As Harington rejoined his castmates, however, something shifted. This is a group of people who are my family, and they have been for the last six years, he says.
Harington forced himself to put on a downcast face. And he began an impromptu performance that he would have to repeat, over and over again.

More:
EW: You literally didnt tell your family?
KH: I couldnt keep it from them  my mum, dad, and brother. I just said, I am still in Thrones, but dont tell anyone. Because otherwise what youre saying to
your family is, financially, This is where the money stops from Thrones. EW: What about your girlfriend, Rose Leslie, who played Ygritte?
KH: I told her from early on. In fact, Dan said to David, Hes going to tell Rose, isnt he? She was allowed to know.

Finishing season 5:
When filming wrapped, Nutter announced to the cast and crew that this was Kit Haringtons final day on the show. Then he called up the actor to address the crowd.
I had to do a fake goodbye speech, Harington says. It was awful. It was like being at my own funeral.

Nutter called the speech heartfelt and quite powerful. Harington told the cast and crew how he had made so many valuable friendships, noted how much he cared for them, and regretted how this part of his life would now be empty.
It was the worst acting Ive ever done, and thats saying something, Harington says of his speech. I couldnt do a big weepy I love you. Some of them bought it, some didnt.
EW: And after the speech? KH: I got the fout. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the EW article:


Not only did actor Kit Harington and the producers manage to hide his role in season 6 from public view (aside from one pesky leaked photo), his role itself is actually huge: Kit Harington spent more days on set this season than any other Thrones actor.

	<TEXT> I'm not talking the laws of the magic or anything like that. I'm simply talking about the fact that the resurrection in the show is literally "Hey Red Woman you ever tried revival" "Yeah I'll give it a shot" *magic hands and words* *everyone gives up hope* *OOP there he is!*

If the books takes that story, it'll be told in a much better way </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But who's to say Roose is to die? Of course, there's a high chance he will, but that's not the point. I think approaching the whole topic with the negative "spoiled is spoiled" viewpoint is counterproductive. The whole point is not what is spoiled. It's that the show is spoiling things, but it's doing it in the quickest way and without any nuance. The approach that the show is taking without GRRM is very hollywood, and hollywood is not what the books are. TWOW will be different enough to keep your interest.

You don't have to watch, and if you have the belief that "spoiled is spoiled" and you're sour about it, then maybe it's a good idea to stop watching. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) Season 6 so far has reaffirmed my belief in the books </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-02 11:54:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I love the show. I will always love the show. 

But when they said the show would be different from the books, just with the same overall story, they weren't lying.

The last two episodes have reaffirmed that this is no longer an adaptation of the books at all, and that we're not spoiling the books by watching it.

Jon's resurrection was un-George. It just felt like the show was doing it because it was expected, and needed to be done. Similarly, deaths have been handled completely ungracefully the last few episodes. The Dorne Assassinations were just completely un-George, and I really don't think we'll ever see Roose die like he did in the show. Even Balon being thrown off the bridge felt like it lacked substance. It was only happening because it had to, and there was no weight behind it. Euron literally just grabbed him and chucked off after a silly discussion that appropriated Euron's character. 

I love the show. I truly enjoy watching it every week, but it's become so unlike the books and George's style. It's lacking nuance. I can't wait for Winds of Winter.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Everything] The Season 6/ASOIAF Hype Train: A Guide for the Uninitiated. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-29 10:47:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all, all good guides should start with an image. So here's one for your convenience: 



http://i.imgur.com/S8QfKFo.jpg


This image will be used as a reference guide. I'll go down the train and explain each and every passenger, as seen in the image.


###Euron Greyjoy


This one's fairly simply. Commandeering this ~~ship~~ train is of course, Euron Greyjoy. He wears a eyepatch and pirate hat as, in the books, he's a pirate (kind of). He's Theon's uncle, and is a general creep/badass. In the books he sends his brother Victarion to go get Dany for him... He's appearing in S6, so the hype is strong here. Moving on


###Lady ~~Stonehype~~Stoneheart


Previously rumoured to appear in Season 3, 4 and 5, and cockteased by D D's episode titles for the past three years, Lady Stonehype takes her place on top of  the train. Lady Stoneheart is a resurrected Catelyn, who wreaks havoc and revenge on Freys in the Riverlands. In the books, she crosses paths with Brienne, and demands she go and retrieve Jaime and bring him to her so she can get revenge on him for not returning her children to her, as they had agreed. 


Her appearance is so unlikely that you could probably bet extreme amounts of money on it at your local gambling establishment for terrible odds. So naturally, the hype is high!


### CLEGANEBOWL


GET HYPE. This theory poses the Hound as the gravedigger in AFFC, and states that he will be called upon to fight for the Faith against the Mountain, in a trial by combat to determine Cersei's fate.


If you want confirmation that this is a thing, just google "Ian McShane". The actor is supposedly playing Septon Meribald, the man who brings the Hound back to life. McShane has even practically confirmed it himself (probably much to dismay of D D).


###UnJon


Well, there's kinda no way to show a resurrected Jon, so I just went with this image of him as a white walker or a wight or something. Realistically, he'll probably just be resurrected. I don't need to elaborate here. Some theories think he'll be finished with the Night's Watch (since his watch is over) and continue on south to fight Ramsay and the Boltons at Winterfell.


###Tyrion Targaryen 


Some theories will have you believe Tyrion is actually a secret Targaryen, and will eventually become a dragonrider. For a nice, rational explanation of this possibility, check out this link:

OR, for an explanation with way more hype, check this one out:

https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/30mat2/spoilers_all_ddt_a_neverbeforeseen_theory


Chances of this happening this season (or at all) are pretty low, but this is a hype train and we don't have room for non-believers. 




That's about it! Want me to add anyone or anything to hype train? Comment below! I know I've probably missed a few things. 


I hope that my explanations have somewhat helped the unitiated understand some of the hype. Let me know what you think


Tl;dr: Pirates, Revenge Cat, Cleganebowl, Snowbowl, Tyrion Targaryen
