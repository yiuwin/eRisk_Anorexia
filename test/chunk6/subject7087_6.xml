	<TEXT> They use him on their propaganda, you dont think the president shitting on ALL Muslims helps their narrative that the west hates them? trump the best recruiter they could ever ask for.

Youll see how Bush and Dick Cheney would talk about Muslims even though they're war criminals they would sound like a liberal these days, would never call ALL of them bad etc.

ISIS clearly doesn't actually love trump but his seems to be very helpful for them.

Also considering he has no plan for them, any nominee with a "secret plan" doesn't have a plan.  </TEXT>

strongly disagree, doing even one of these things is clearly pro censorship..

 not all censorship is bad (no brainer to most people)

you're saying suing satire and jokes, vowing to crack down on internet porn and opening the libel laws is "good censorship"?... </TEXT>
