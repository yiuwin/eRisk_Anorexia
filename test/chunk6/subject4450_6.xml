	<TEXT> while not as good or rewatchable as the first, i feel like this is the marvel sequel that'll age the best

best character development, most emotionally satisfying climax, and no real villain for most of the film (a welcome break from the marvel formula)

it's unique and weird and i love it for that </TEXT>
