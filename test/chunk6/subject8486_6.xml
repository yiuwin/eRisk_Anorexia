	<TEXT> It has been a number of years since I looked for daycare, but I think any place that's not a large daycare center isn't going to be able to provide availability six months in advance.  So relax a bit.

On the other hand, checking out providers and having a list of potential ones that you can call next year is certainly something that you want to do the legwork on ahead of time. (BTW, the state has a list of licensed family child care centers you ought to consult). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Massachusetts is perhaps the only place in the world where there are 'representative town meetings': town meeting which is elected, instead of having everyone participate. They do have a very high number of members, generally: 240 in Brookline, 200 in Lexington. 

Towns with this form of government DO have a board of selectmen to run the day-to-day business.

And remember, it's these local governments that make a lot of the decisions that effect your daily life: hours and numbers of restaurants, parking rules, quality of schools, taxes (which affect you even if you rent), safety regulations, and more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One good place to start is http://www.uptontea.com.  They offer a very wide range of quality teas in most every style; the website offers good descriptions of each tea; and they make every tea available in small samples so you can try a bunch and figure out what you like.

I'd say, if you like black tea, that it is essential to try Assam, Darjeeling, Ceylon, and Keemun. </TEXT>

Wouldn't you say that helping larger numbers of people with job training or transitioning to permanent housing or treating substance abuse/mental health issues (which are often the root causes of homelessness) would help more than helping the one person?

As you say, this could be a great thing for this one person, and permanently change his life in a great way.  But I prefer to try to help more than one person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most tools offer that.  But think about how many comments there are about any reasonably-sized brand. Do you want to have to be in the tool checking them all and adjusting them constantly? And how is that better than the much cheaper alternative of getting a list of mentions, dumping them in a spreadsheet, and checking them all manually as positive or negative? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work for a not-very-large brand, and we rarely respond to @messages. I can only imagine that celebrities respond to none. Unless your message really resonates with their personal cause (in which case, you're probably better off reaching out directly to their PR people, instead of hoping someone notices). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have any help on your main question, but can help clarify some terms. The IEP is created by the school to address your disabilities and the way they will be accommodated.  Your therapist doesn't create it.

Depending on what your disability is, you may not need a full (and expensive) neuropsychological evaluation to get your diagnosis documented.  A qualified psychologist should be able to look at the testing report, and just repeat part of it. </TEXT>
