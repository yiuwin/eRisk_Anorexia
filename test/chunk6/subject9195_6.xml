	<TEXT> Sorry its a before and "after" album. Look at the "after" pics please. Nothing is flexed, except stomach vacuum. I've been cutting for a while. The average given BF% of 7 Body Fat calculators puts me at 16% (which seems a bit low still).

I was initially planning on cutting till I hit 163, and then bulking, but I'm not sure. I've been doing a modified version of strong lifts 5x5 (to try and maintain some strength), while eating in a deficit.  </TEXT>
