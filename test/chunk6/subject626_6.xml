	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure this is a common bug of the historical focus AI if the player takes alternative history decisions 

it also happens if you do little entente as france and invite romania etc. - they just garrison their entire land and dont even have a front line until the german front reaches their country and even then they send a small fraction of their total number to defend themselves. also germany pulls (basically) their entire french front to poland halfway through Danzig Or War despite being occupied by baguettes right up to berlin

	<TEXT> I mean yeah those are big numbers and you win that battle but could you realistically hold if the entire front line was attacking you with fleshed out 120 combat width everywhere, locking up all movement? would you do worse, similar, or better if you'd pushed 3-4 battles of 120 combat width of infart for the same production cost? without these panzer divisions, would the soviets have realistically ever beat you?

let's be honest if you play Germany you're going to have success regardless of what you do because you start out so far ahead of everyone, I'm personally more concerned with starts that force you to prioritize your production and research rather than just churning out a lot of everything.

I'm talking mostly about the opportunity cost of tanks not being really worthwhile compared to straight infart </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well shit I didn't realize paradox were such idiots lmao

the very easy and obvious solution is to make the stats additive and introduce diminishing returns for very large divisions to reflect the fact it's harder to *organize* larger divisions.

just a random example of such diminishing returns would be, I dunno, org penalty, initiative penalty, scaling training time and experience gain penalty (harder to create coherent divisions and learn to fight as a unit) etc.

they just spent all their time coding AI on this one

	<TEXT> can you explain your point about combat width because I'm not sure I get what you mean.


You are right that their meager attack is a big problem. In reality their main purpose is to negate or overcome enemy entrenchment, this could be modeled in game by removing enemy entrenchment bonuses to defense if your tanks are not being pierced for example. If they also boosted up entrenchment to the point where infart could not break each other (defense always winning 4:1 or more) they would replicate the real-life conditions that brought about the need for tanks in the first place.

The biggest thing I don't understand about tanks is why they have such low org, why a pure tank division can't just steam roll an infantry division with zero anti-tank support or line divisions is complete bs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never seen significantly better results from adding tanks to my configuration though, in fact often I feel like I'm less powerful by diluting my production compared to just sticking to infart. Do you have an example of a playthrough where you can make significant use of tanks (not Germany USA or soviets)?

I've always thought tanks were meant to allow you to leverage production output to overcome manpower shortage but it seems to me no country with manpower shortage is able to produce tanks and have an effective army simultaneously </TEXT>
