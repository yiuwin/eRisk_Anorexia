	<TEXT> She did learn something though. Heck, her entire game is completely different this time. She's been holding herself back in every possible way in order to not piss people off or look like a target. Did she take it too far? Yeah, but you can't say she didn't learn from her mistakes. Also, I think it's important to consider the fact that this season was two weeks after her original season. She never got to see her season air before playing so it was probably hard to understand what really went wrong the first time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no sympathy for people who can't adapt to the market. If you want to get paid for making youtube videos, you have to make videos people want to pay you for, period. You can't go "WHY WON'T THEY MONETIZE MY PEEING JOKE?!" you have to say "alright, they aren't going to monetize the peeing joke, time to come up with a new joke they will monetize." Good riddance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, the Rotu 4 alliance. There's just something about all of the that's...off and it makes me uncomfortable. I feel like they're all aliens or something. And Vecepia is just such a bizarre winner to me, her game is really hard to qualify and she isn't as well-regarded as the other early winners were. And then there's the fact that the reunion show was hosted by Rosie O'Donnell...I don't know this season feels like a survivor fever dream to me. </TEXT>
