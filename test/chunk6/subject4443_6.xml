	<TEXT> You can save on Windows. Unactivated Windows 10 has a watermark. If you can live with that, you can put that cash towards some other components.  

Higher speed ram will improve performance. 

From what I've read on r/nvidia, SLI doesn't give the performance you'd expect and it's better to go for a single better GPU instead. 1080 Ti FE is a steal at its price( blower style cooler not withstanding) .  

Also. Apparently iCX versions are apparently better than ACX from what I've read, but don't quote me on that.

Good build overall. Cheers mate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great build.  Good choice mate. 

Also. Ryzen 5 series processors are out April 11th. If you can wait, check out the performance of the 4core Ryzens.  They'll be cheaper and going by the fact that they have only 1 CCX, they might, just might perform great while gaming.  

You can then put the extra cash for an ssd.

	<TEXT> 1700X or even the cheaper 1700, if you know how to manually OC a processor.  You'll actually be getting a better value for your money and similar if not better performance with AMDs offering in this case. 

In case you still want to go with Intel, apparently they are planning on bringing in 6core chips later this year, then again they probably won't bring it soon enough.  

That said, the difference between the 1700 and the 1700X is the amount of clockspeed you can get after OC. The 1700 overclocks to 3.9GHz stable while the 1700X /1800X overclocks to 4.1GHz stable. 

All 3 chips are great in multi threaded loads. But I'll suggest that you check out reviews specific to the softwares you plan on using to get a better idea how it'll perform.  It'll help you decide which chip to go for. </TEXT>

The other guy who told me that he had low temps just messaged me back saying he had delid it and had water cooling.  

About TIM. I doubt there are any others with better TIM. Since Intels known to save costs by putting a cheaper one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope.  You're not the only one who's facing this issue. There's been quite a few 7700K adopters recently and a lot of them have complained here about the high temps, idle or load. 

It's everything to do Intel cheapening out on the the IHS paste, using metaphorically "Cheap Chinese toothpaste" for the heat spreader. 

Try reducing voltage and see if you're getting better temps.  Last option is delidding, unless you want to go for Ryzen. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, "Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink." They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, "Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore." At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. "Look," she said, "I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen."  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A new store has opened up in New York City that sells Husbands. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-13 02:46:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When women go to choose a husband, they have to follow the instructions at the entrance: 

"You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are 6 floors and the value of the products increase as you ascend the flights. You may choose any item from a particular floor or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you CANNOT go back down except to exit the building!" 

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. 

The 1st floor sign reads: Floor 1 - These men have jobs. 

The 2nd floor sign reads: Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids. 

The 3rd floor sign reads: Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids and are extremely good looking. 

"Wow," she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. 

She goes to the 4th floor and The sign reads: Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help with Housework. 

"Oh, mercy me!" she exclaims, "I can hardly stand it!" Still, she goes to the 5th floor and The sign reads: Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, help with Housework and Have A Strong Romantic Streak. 

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the 6th floor and the sign reads: 

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good specs. That said, if possible go for RX 480 8GB for the graphics card. Better to have more vram. But Frankly what you need in there is a Quadro series card from Nvidia.  Also a bit faster ram 2400mhz /2666mhz.  

Make sure you update your bios first thing post OS installation. </TEXT>
