	<TEXT> Thank you very much for being here!

I'm curious to know more about your collection of First World War accounts. With the death of the last living veterans of the war, this repository has become more important than ever; what is the scope of its contents, how are they being preserved, and what do you have planned (if anything!) for 2017?

Thanks again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would echo /u/sunagainstgold's take on it -- small in size and quick to read in principle, but there's much in it that requires a more lengthy and digestive approach. In a sense, I found myself still "reading" it long after the physical process of turning the pages was over -- and I'm still not entirely convinced I'm finished.

Absolutely worth reading, though; Coates has cemented himself among the very best of our current essayists with good reason. </TEXT>

I had the privilege of attending a reading by Mr. Ghosh back in 2011 when *River of Smoke* came out, and the discussion afterwards on the difficulties surrounding the crafting of historical fiction was incredible.  He was sharing the stage with Guy Vanderhaeghe, one of Canada's most accomplished literary figures and a terrific author of historical fiction in his own right.  It was an amazing evening, especially considering that it was free. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I've been looking into this a bit both on my own and through Twitter inquiries.  

It seems that much of this idea can be traced back to contemporary reports from British officers who claim to have heard it from German POWs in the first few months of the war.  These are named officers, to be clear, writing in their own words, in their own works -- but I've no way to verify their accounts, and still less to verify whether or not those putative POWs were telling the truth if they ever said any such thing at all.  This was an age of whirling rumour and exaggeration, unhappily, even if much of it was basically pious at heart. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My own experience with books like this is to use them as meditative objects rather than as strict note-for-note cookbooks.  While following along with everything in them is technically possible, I've found it's much more rewarding to simply take their contents as pretexts for thinking about food in new ways.  This can be of real help and use to you even if you don't end up reproducing whatever happens to be on a given page of the book.

For example, I was recently making my way through a truly excellent Scandinavian cookbook that described the chef's unorthodox experiments with moss-infused broth or letting vinegars mature in oak stumps to change the flavour.  These are not things I can practically do in my small downtown apartment, but they did make me think about the processes involved and how I can scale them towards what I have in terms of materials and space -- or even just thinking of how materials I would never have conceived of as being culinary might find their place in my own cooking.

Finally, and perhaps sort of peppily: the dishes in these books are of course the result of considerable and meticulous effort, but all of this also required a dash of daring!  These restaurants have not become as popular as they are by sticking to the conventional.  Even if the work and ingredients aren't exactly practical to someone reading the book, that sense of adventure can still be stoked. </TEXT>

I know it all makes perfect sense after a little investigation, of course, but at the time I was mostly informed by the popular view of the war.  Japan certainly doesn't figure too largely in THAT. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome, Dr. Lukacs; thank you very much for agreeing to visit us this week!

My question is more abstract than specific, and (I suppose) more personal than really historical.  Given that you have a rich deposit of personal, experiential knowledge, and that you have in a very real sense "lived through history," how do you find that this personal involvement has impacted your work as an historian?  Alternately, do you find that your work as an historian and your knowledge of theory/philosophy of history/etc. has impacted your understanding of your own experiences?

Thank you once again for stopping by. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, *for my own part* (as distinct from a matter of historical record), I view it as sort of grotesque to faff about prolonging the war amidst the ruins of hundreds of French and Belgian communities -- especially while the inhabitants of those communities either lay dead beneath the soldiers' football-playing feet (however exaggerated) or lived in destitute poverty in refugee camps throughout France, Holland, or England, if they weren't instead in German prison camps behind the lines.

Militarily, what we find in the Truce is a collection of almost exclusively volunteer soldiers, under oaths of service, who chose to fuck around instead of prosecuting their duty to the best of their abilities.  This does not impress me.

I recognize that a position such as this really does depend a great deal upon what one values in the midst of a conflict, and I can absolutely understand the more general popular response to the Truce even if I do not share in it. 

I will say as well that I am very much irritated by how this event is held up as yet another example of how wise and superior the common soldier was when compared to those idiotic, blood-thirsty generals, who barbarically wanted to win a war instead of having some skylarking kickabout. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [**Christmas in the Trenches**](http://i.imgur.com/8qmUYms.jpg)

Much has been said and written about the famous Christmas Truce(s) of 1914  and filmed, too, whether in the profoundly serious *Joyeux Nol* (2005) or the childrens animated short War Game (2001)  and much in those materials has been made of how illustrative it was of the better intentions of the men over their barbarous, war-mongering generals, the shared humanity of those in the trenches, the cruelly snuffed possibility of Finding A Better Way, etc. etc.  I have my own views on all that, which many here have already heard with dismay, but for now Ill draw attention to the fact of the image linked above being from 191**5**.

The official discouragement that was one consequence of the truces of 1914 took some of the spring from the step of those looking to indulge in sentimental affection in the middle of a war.  A rather different approach to the matter can be discerned in 1915, in spite of the efforts of soldiers like those in the photo above.

Lets take a look at how Christmas 1915 played out in the memoirs of two somewhat notorious participants in the war.

From Michael Hoffmanns translation of Ernst Jngers *Storm of Steel* (1920):

 We spent Christmas Eve in the line, and, standing in the mud, sang hymns, to which the British responded with machine gun fire.  On Christmas Day we lost one man to a ricochet in the head.  Immediately afterwards, the British attempted a friendly gesture by hauling a Christmas tree up on their traverse, but our angry troops quickly shot it down again, to which Tommy replied with rifle-grenades.  It was all in all less than a merry Christmas.

And from A.O. Pollards *Fire-Eater: Memoirs of a V.C.* (1932):

 We spent Christmas Day in the front line.  At midnight on Christmas Eve we sang all the carols we could remember; the whole company in one huge chorus.  After we had exhausted our repertoire there was a lull.  Then the Bavarians started in their trenches.  Christmas Day was uneventful.  There was no shelling and both sides were unusually quiet.  At noon [we] decided to let Fritz know we were on the alert and contemptuous of him.  We climbed on to the fire-step and fired off five rounds rapid.  There was no reply.

While modest gestures towards a repeat of the previous years festivities are apparent, nobody seemed keen to get into it again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is this really a commonly held view?

Very much so.  It is routinely held up as some triumphant moment of shared humanity and an example of how the war should have *really* ended if not for those pesky generals and evidence that we're really all just the same and oh my the Spirit of the Season and on and on and on. 

They tried to get ["All Together Now"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Together_Now_(The_Farm_song\)) to the top of the Christmas chart in the UK last year, and very nearly succeeded.  It is absolutely a commonly held view.  It is certainly "widely understood" among historians of the war that this was a momentary and unremarkable blip upon a much greater horizon of ongoing violence, but the public is absolutely fascinated with it. </TEXT>

I'm also sorry I wasn't able to take a look at it the other day! Things got busy in the evening, but I can see that it's exactly as amazing as we've come to expect from you.

As you've suggested elsewhere, my own position on the Truce has shifted over the course of my life from warm approbation through complex caution before arriving, finally, at actual disgust.  Thinking about it just makes me angry now, and hearing it championed so constantly in media accounts of the war is tremendously frustrating.

Oh well -- only a few days more and we can go back to not thinking about it for a year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you can, try to find a library or cheap used copy of *The Outbreak of World War I* (6th ed., 1997), edited by Holger Herwig for the *Problems in European Civilization* series.  While it is not the most current work available on the subject, it is nevertheless a wonderful collection of very accessible essays about the leading theories where the war's origins are concerned.  This volume, like others in the same series, is especially focused on providing details to the newcomer about not just the history of the events being discussed, but also about the ongoing controversies and debates over those events.

This is a short volume indeed, but it packs more value per page than any other I've seen on the subject.

I'm sure earlier editions of it will be fine as well; you can get a copy of one from 1991 [for $1.27 here](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=15333211817), currently, but do check your library! </TEXT>

In a story that involves travel between universes, a world in which Alexander the Great lived to a ripe old age, and battles between attack helicopters and Native American warriors, the least plausible thing is the fact that segways are popular everywhere.  I presume he was writing the bulk of the thing just as the device was hitting the market, but still -- it's jarring. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To live under German occupation in Belgium or France during the First World War was to find oneself mired in an appalling poverty that started out awful and only got worse.  Dozens of industries collapsed as a consequence of the invasion, and the German insistence on overseeing every facet of those they considered essential (infrastructural supplies, communications, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.) saw many others driven into bankruptcy as the war dragged on.  Travel without proper papers was impossible, and prohibitively difficult even with them.  Civil authorities could not operate without the inspection and endorsement of German officers, assuming they hadn't just been replaced by collaborators or German bureaucrats in the first place.  Public gatherings were forbidden.  Clergy were harassed.  Private property was subject to snap inspection and search on no pretense at all, and anything of value could be declared seizeable contraband without any formal justification whatsoever.

The life of these communities was strangled in other ways.  Most notably, the leading citizens in hundreds of villages, towns and cities (usually starting with the mayor and his staff, but extending to those who were wealthy, well-endowed with land, highly educated or generally thought to be powerful in some way) were taken as hostages and sent away -- sometimes to elsewhere in the country, but very frequently to Germany itself.  Many of them would die in captivity.

Hundreds of thousands of civilians were forcibly deported throughout the course of the occupation, often never seeing their friends or family again.  Some were sent to prison camps within Germany itself (Holzminden and Rastatt being the most notorious), while many others were sent to labour camps throughout the occupied territories.  These prisoners were kept on starvation rations and given the choice of working for the German war effort against their will, in which case they were functionally treated as slaves, or in a comparatively more co-operative spirit, in which case they were also functionally treated as slaves.  

This latter group of prisoners were conscripted into the *Zivilarbeiter Bataillonen* (the "red armbands", as they came colloquially to be called), which was responsible for a variety of work in aid of the German war effort in their own country, against their own people.  Sometimes this was only infrastructural repair or farming or land-clearing; sometimes it involved *digging German trenches while under fire from Allied guns*.  The slave-prisoners who refused to join the ZB had the same work, but none of the very slender perks associated with it (slightly increased rations, the ability to send and receive mail, etc.).  They could also tell themselves, for what it was worth, that they had not willingly lent their support to the destruction of their sons and brothers who were still in the fight.

There is also the matter of the program that saw thousands of French and Belgian women abducted and deported without warning to special camps in Germany -- hostages taken to ensure co-operation back home.  

Annette Becker's *Oublis de la Grande guerre* (1998) (among other of her volumes and articles) has much more on this from the French perspective, while much of [Heather Jones' considerable output](http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalHistory/whosWho/academicStaff/jones.aspx#tabbedarea_L14_3) has to do with the experience of POWs under German control. </TEXT>

Chesterton skewers certain types of "social reformers" who then enjoyed considerable public influence -- many of them for preaching a secular gospel of the perfectable human being.

	<TEXT> This is a late recommendation for your very interesting-sounding project, but you should check out Iain Sinclair's *Lud Heat*, which is an amazing poetic meditation on the sinister qualities of London's cityscape.  Peter Ackroyd is a great fan of it, as is Alan Moore, and it has a lot to do with the architectonic problems articulated in *Hawksmoor*.

While I would agree with others' recommendation of Bachelard, I would also suggest some of the essays found in Georges Perec's *Species of Spaces and Other Places*.

Have you considered looking at some theorists of urban planning as well?  Jane Jacobs is a particularly famous and influential one, and has many interesting books on the subject. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to admit to carrying a bit of a torch for this movie.  A lot of it is weird as hell, and Cage is always Cage, but there's something so amazingly satisfying in it being willing to let a mysterious warning about impending doom be... just a warning.  It's only information, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.  In any other movie the protagonist would decipher it, find the amulet/crystal/chosen one/reactor core/ancient something, save the day, etc.  In *Knowing*, though, there's literally nothing that can be done.  The warning is *just* information, not an action plan.

	<DATE> 2015-11-07 03:33:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Structural and personal problems [with artillery direction] remained, however.  Perhaps the most notorious came in VI Corps in late 1916 when the Amazon explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett arrived to take up the new post of corps counter-battery colonel.  He immediately declared that he was not in the least interested in the innovative work being done on the detection of German guns by flash-spotting and sound-ranging.  His corps counter-battery intelligence officer was invited to 'go away and stay away'.  The only counter-battery shots which he would allow, he declared, were those against targets clearly visibly from British lines, **or those he had personally detected on his ouija board** (emphasis subject9371's).  One brother officer described him as 'probably the nastiest man I have ever met in this world', and there must have been some wry smiles when he disappeared on an expedition to the Mato Grosso in 1925.

	<TEXT> One thing I'll add to this otherwise fine answer is that there were ways to avoid a certain amount of trench experience once you were actually in the infantry.  Enlisted men could (and regularly did) volunteer for specialized training (e.g. as bombers, machine gunners, etc.) that would see them removed from the trench rotation for days or even weeks.  The Army needed specialists, and this is how it produced many of them.

I should add as well that the situation with cooks was an interesting one; while one could not just volunteer at the recruiting office to be a cook and only a cook, many positions within the front-line cooking infrastructure were indeed distributed to volunteers.  This did not preserve them from the trenches full stop, as even the cooks were expected to fight, but it did go some way towards relieving the monotony of it all.  It also, regrettably, lent a tragically amateur character to some of the British Army's food production at the front lines -- many of those who joined a ration party or helped in the mess had never cooked a thing in their lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Wilfred Owen's career was terribly short, by any standard, but his early attempts at the conventional nature poems and other Keatsian rehashings would give way in 1916 or so to a tremendous flourishing of talent.  The war poems that would be the sole focus of his energies until his death in 1918 have a totally different and superior character to anything he had attempted previously.

2. While a strain of thematic and liberal Christianity can be found throughout much of G.K. Chesterton's early and middle work, his conversion to Catholicism in 1922 saw the Roman Church become a perennial subject in his writings until his death in 1936. 

3. The career of C.S. Lewis, similarly, underwent a profound alteration upon his conversion to the Church of England.  Apart from the most obvious difference, being his decision to actively explore the implications of the Christian faith in both works of apologetics and works of fiction, his conversion seems also to have been the death knell for his hope of becoming a successful poet.  Lewis' early career had been marked by numerous poetic forays, ranging from varied short works to longer narrative standalone poems like "The Queen of Drum" and "Dymer".

4. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, perhaps?  His early/mid career is marked by an intense variety of literary production on all sorts of subjects, but his developing interest in the world of Spiritualism (as it was called; the purported communication with the dead, among other things) saw this seep into most of his written works as his career drew to a close.  Even the normally stubborn and skeptical Professor Challenger of the *Lost World* stories would eventually fall under its spell, if I remember correctly.

5. I feel like Ezra Pound could be in here as well, depending upon one's perspective.  While his career was intensely varied throughout, one has no choice but to mark an astounding difference between the earliest of his *Cantos* and the latest.  He begins them as a tribute to Browning, to Homer, to Malatesta -- and all in familiar tones, meters, modes; he concludes them in a bewildering explosion of Sanskrit, Chinese pictograms, Provenal, and heaven knows what else. </TEXT>

This volume won't tell you in blunt terms how it all happened, but it will give you amazingly valuable insight into the disputes that still exist about that subject.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> While perusing [the Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbershop) on Barbershop Music, I was surprised to learn that the actual origins of the genre -- and the reason that it even has its name -- is actually matter of some contention:

 "In recent years, new insights and greater clarity have been acquired, which include aesthetic issues relating to sound, some answers to questions of race, gender, and other social factors shaping the genre, and exploration of the ideology surrounding the so-called revival around 1940. Still, the debate about the origins of this genre seems to be widely unsettled. The current models that chart the birth of barbershop harmony are diverse and often contradictory with regard to categories such as race, gender, regional context, social environment, amateur or professional, impromptu or composed-arranged, and highbrow or lowbrow."

I can see this sort of thing happening quite easily for much older and more mysterious art forms, but this is a twentieth-century development.  Is it really actually a mystery?  What work have musicologists and music historians been doing on it lately? </TEXT>

Was this pseudo-medical approach to the matter always on the table from the very beginning, or has it only been adopted in the intervening decades?  How did medical scientists respond to the idea?  And have they played any role in the subsequent collapse of meme theory as a field? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your best bet would probably be to cover all of those platforms and more!  There are many people who use only some, or only one, to the exclusion of others -- and there are ways of automating the process pretty substantially so it isn't a complete pain to keep it all updated.  Twitter at least seems to be essential, though, and you'd do well indeed to hit the bigger history subreddits (as well as /r/Islam, of course!).  /r/Podcasts also exists, and is happy to help promote new programs!

What sort of length per episode do you have in mind?  People with established and fanatic listener bases can get away with multiple-hour programs, but it might be worth aiming for a bit more in the way of brevity to entice new listeners.  Offer something they can "try out" easily without committing a tenth of their day to it.

Another potentially useful consideration: having a short write-up attached to each episode for the benefit of those who are on the fence.  A paragraph or two hitting the major points would be fine.  This would make a tumblr or something very useful, but I suppose it's not wholly necessary!

Make sure to see about getting your podcast hosted on multiple platforms, if you can.  There are a lot of them out there and not everyone you're likely to want as an audience is going to be subscribed to all of them!

I wish you all the best with it, anyway -- this is a daunting task, but also potentially very rewarding indeed!  I think you'll be filling a very important role with this particular topic as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But none of those were from Shakespeare himself. The Folio was posthumous, the quartos were unauthorized. No evidence exists to show that Shakespeare ever intended his plays to be read as pieces of literature whole and complete in their textual form, so I'll stand by my statement that they were meant as performance pieces -- at the very least primarily, if not solely.

Right, but I'm not focusing on Shakespeare's intention here, which wouldn't matter in any case.  What matters for our purpose is that dramas were being published as books for a reading audience rather than just as prompt-books for performing troupes, and that this enterprise was viewed as both commercially viable and -- more importantly -- unremarkable.

 But Shakespeare's plays? Never saw them in school, save for one clip of a movie adaptation of *Romeo and Juliet*. We read *Romeo and Juliet*, *Julius Caesar*, *The Winter's Tale*, *Hamlet*, and a few others I can't remember at this point, and yet not once did we see any performance or adaptation of any of them. If that seems like the proper way to teach Shakespeare to teenagers to you, then I'm afraid we have an irreconcilable difference of opinion.

That does strike me as an absurd approach, if one is to teach Shakespeare to teenagers at all, but I'm not entirely convinced that we even should.  

Throughout this thread, as in many threads and general discussions like it, there is a consistent tendency for students to respond most poorly to works that require them to empathize with and situate themselves within contexts and characters that are very far-removed from their own present situations.  Teaching students to be able to **do** this is naturally one of the goals of the educator (or at least should be), but there seems to be something unreasonable about trying to have them run before they can walk.  It requires a great deal of imagination, sympathy, and work for a child born in 2000 to get out of *The Scarlet Letter* or *Great Expectations* or *Hamlet* all or even much that there is to get, and too often it seems that demanding this at such an early age simply ends up alienating that child from literature at a crucial step in his or her development.

Anyway, I certainly agree that it would be absurd to teach important works of drama to young people without giving them some insight into how they might be performed; I was mostly just responding to the seemingly implied idea that *only* performance matters when it comes to the print history and significance of dramatic works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But plays are not meant to be read by the audience, they're meant to be performed.

This is controversial, though!  Certainly *most* drama is written with performance in mind, but there are entire sub-fields of drama -- like the "closet drama," for example -- that are meant more as experiments of form than as templates for physical staging.  There are epic dramas, too, that defy even earnest attempts to stage them and are *absolutely* meant to be read rather than performed; consider something like Thomas Hardy's *The Dynasts* (1904-1908), which contains some 19 Acts and 133 Scenes, and which would require the cast and crew to somehow dramatize everything from a satellite's view of Europe depicted as a prostrate man to the battle of certain spirits within a human heart.  Even today it would be hard to do this convincingly, but in 1908?  

Even with Shakespeare the situation is complicated.  Certainly his plays *are* plays that *can* be performed, but that's not the only way in which they were presented even during his own life.  Published versions circulated to be read, not just used by theatrical troupes, and the 1623 First Folio compiled by Condell and Heminges was a rather expensive 630-page document that would not have been well-suited to use as script material at all.

All of this is to say nothing of the fact that no two productions of a play will ever be the same, or even CLOSE to the same; every theatrical company or troupe has its own ideas, its own alterations, its own agendas when it comes to adapting a printed play.  "Adaptation" is the key, though; they're engaging with a readable text and translating it into a different form.

In short, plays -- even Shakespeare's plays -- involve printed text on paper.  This is meant to be read.  What one does with that text afterward is another matter, but saying that one can only effectively enjoy or learn about a play by seeing it performed rather than by reading it is going a bit to far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of this remains a bit too speculative, though.  

The earliest English translation of *The Odyssey* that is commercially available is Chapman's from 1615; this is contemporary with the works of Shakespeare and is very far from difficult to read (though it is certainly a bit antiquated from a modern perspective).  It is frequently reprinted in cheap paperback editions, owing to being easily accessible and in the public domain, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ended up with this one.

The Pope translation from 1725 is also widely available and rather popular, but it's even less difficult to read.  By the time we reach the next still-commercially-printed translations we're past the 1850s, and there's nothing at all in there that could stand being described as "old English."

In short, you probably ended up with Chapman's *Odyssey*.  I'm sorry it wasn't more to your liking, though!  I really enjoyed it, though my favourite *Odyssey* translations remain Pope's and Lattimore's.  E.V. Rieu's 1945 prose translation is also really cool, though mostly (to me, anyway) for the story behind it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many of us who post in /r/AskHistorians work in fields that continue to see different scholars and schools of thought contend with one another over matters of interpretation, evidence, ethics, etc.  Historiographic debate is a rich and interesting field, if sometimes somewhat maddening.

I realized yesterday, however, that I've no idea at all how this sort of thing manifests itself in the field of sports history.  Are there disputes there as well about the role of "great man"-style work?  Is there a subaltern that experiences only complicated acknowledgment?  Are their iconoclasts or dissenters in the field who hold controversial positions?  Have there been archival controversies (or even disasters)?  What role do Marxist/Feminist/Post-Colonial/etc. approaches play in the field?

There are a lot of possibilities here as far as answers go, and I'll be glad to winnow the above down a bit further if the mods request it. </TEXT>

1. How did the Great European War impact the Maison Lucile and its attendant salons?  I imagine the Paris branch had considerable difficulties, but I note that you were able to open a new branch (in Chicago) even while the war was still in progress. 

2. Can you tell us some more about your "emotional gowns"?  What sort of process was involved in creating them, and really, uh... what was the deal with them generally?  This is a very inarticulate question, but I lack the fashion vocabulary to ask it properly.

3. Beyond presumably being an outrage to you personally, how did the decision in *Wood vs. Lucy, Lady Duff Gordon* alter your marketing practices in the years following 1917?

	<TEXT>  I have to wonder how such a large, powerful empire, with deep roots going back a very long time could ever get to the point where it was such a clusterfuck.

Well, I think one important factor in this the "cultural schism", if we may call it that, which existed in the Empire.  

There were competing Austrian and Hungarian kingships and political hierarchies, thanks to the dual system established in 1867, to say nothing of the many small ethnic and religious enclaves that existed throughout Austro-Hungarian territory, and everyone involved each resented their counterparts to a very heightened degree.  Some of the opprobrium surrounding Franz Ferdinand during his life had less to do with him being a difficult person and more to do with him being an *Austrian* heir rather than a Hungarian one.  Certainly his stated desire to consolidate the Empire into a united confederation of ethnic states with Austria as the overarching authority -- rather than Hungary, that is -- did not win him many friends in certain political circles, and there were uncomfortable rumours that his assassination, if not actually ordered by Hungarian-sympathetic opponents within the Empire, was not exactly balked at when it happened.   

/u/_elos has rightly mentioned the absurd compartmentalization of the Austro-Hungarian military along cultural lines; this isn't a decision that was arrived at out of a regard for what was most militarily desirable, but rather what was politically tolerable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With a particular regard to myths and controversies, you might give these a try:

- Gary Sheffield's *Forgotten Victory*
- Dan Todman's *The Great War: Myth and Memory*
- John Terraine's *The Smoke and the Fire*

Gordon Corrigan's *Mud, Blood, and Poppycock* is a reasonable introduction to the debates as well, but I find it a bit too caustic and deliberately contrarian (at points) to really earnestly recommend it.  Terraine's is probably the best of the three above in terms of sheer quality, but also the least accessible given its age; Todman's is the most recent, though still ten years old.

More recently, Brian Bond's *Britain's Two World Wars against Germany: Myth, Memory and the Distortions of Hindsight* (2014) provides an excellent introductory overview to these problems, but without the specific WWI focus that you might desire. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good grief.  With Haig and Kiggel I can now raise to four the number of generals who are alleged to have so heartlessly come to this realization.  It has as much substance behind it as the actual "Lions led by Donkeys" thing -- which seems in any event to have had its provenance in the Franco-Prussian War, if not earlier.

I note too that attributing this quote to Haig flies in the face of the irreconcilable claim that he "never once visited the lines".  That's not true either, as his diaries and his letters and other people's recollections attest, but still -- they should at least be consistent in what they impute to the man.

Yes, I've read that new Bond book -- it's very good indeed, though I found some of it to be a bit of retread of material he's covered elsewhere.  Still, it's quite up to date, and the comparative approach is deeply appreciated.  I was pleased to see also that there's [a new collection](http://www.helion.co.uk/new-and-forthcoming-titles/from-liddell-hart-to-joan-littlewood-studies-in-british-military-history.html) of his essays and occasional works out as well, or at least slated to be out soon (I think it's available in the UK but not widely in North America, yet).  Very much looking forward to checking it out, and to having all of those pieces in one handy volume.

One recommendation if you haven't had a chance to look at it yet: while it's a bit outdated, the volume Bond edited for Oxford called [*The First World War and British Military History*](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198222996.001.0001/acprof-9780198222996) (1991) is absolutely indispensible.

	<TEXT> I'm a bit late to the party on this, but I wanted to offer my vote of thanks and praise for this (as usual) excellent work.  The amount of rot that continues to be written about the war is an absolute scandal, and work like yours is very much the kind of thing that we need in response. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you seen Peter Watkins' *The War Game* (1965)?  It's a precursor to *Threads* on the same subject that is shot in Watkins' signature faux-documentary style, complete with interviews with survivors, emergency workers, etc.  The actual bombings have an appalling intensity to them in spite of the work's low budget and black-and-white aesthetic, and it is a film that has a reasonable chance of giving nightmares to those who see it.  You can find it online in its entirety very easily.

*Testament* (1983) is an interesting and heart-breaking TV film that tells the story of a small town that was largely cut off from the initial attacks but which still has to deal with both the abstract and literal fall-out.  It's worth watching for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you found this bleak and terrifying, I'd be interested in your perspective on the British take on the same subject: [*Threads*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threads) (1984).  If anything, I found it slightly more appalling than *The Day After* -- but they're admittedly different approaches. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm doubtful this qualifies, and it's certainly very short if so, but still:

The notorious English occultist Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) spent most of the First World War in the United States.  He spent the bulk of his time there working odd literary and editorial jobs while travelling around to visit certain cultural and geographical hotspots while continuing to work on his joint career as an author and a painter.  A lot of this involved him indulging (to put it somewhat politely) in a great deal of drug experimentation and "sex rituals," and not always with happy results in either case.

During the course of this trip, he also spent a great deal of time speaking against the potential entry of the United States into the ongoing war against Germany.  He became a prolific writer of anti-Allied propaganda, as well as a dynamic maker of often ludicrous-seeming speeches.  He took his Irish ancestry as the platform from which he denounced Britain and her role in the war, calling instead for a general Irish revolution and for a German victory that could finally allow this to happen.  In all of this he joined a small cadre of other British intellectuals -- like the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw and the English scholar Houston Stewart Chamberlain -- who found themselves being held up as traitors (however defined) to the British cause.

It turned out, in the end, that Crowley seems to have been a double-agent all along -- working for Britain the entire time, and writing/orating things that were calculated to make the neutral and pro-German causes in the United States look extravagant and foolish.  All of this would culminate in his novel *Moonchild* -- written in 1917 and published in 1923 -- which saw the various forces of white and dark magic take their sides (respectively) with the Entente and Central Powers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My own answer to this question as an amateur probably sucks, but I just wanted to note that I absolutely love the idea of this contest and wish I could either participate in it or serve as a "judge" of sorts.  Even just watching it would be enough.

That said:

- Mustard powder

- Ground cumin

- Cardamom

Two final questions, though:

1. What's the butter situation in the contest?

2. And what's the garlic situation?

Depending upon the answer I'd probably change my response.  I'm probably too late, anyway, given that the contest was tonight, so I guess I'll just close by asking how it went! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is great!  I've had good results with adding lots of mushrooms to this as well, but there's really no wrong way to do it as long as you end up with "thick tomato-vegetable stuff" with eggs on top.

One variant that's pretty neat: get some large, open mushroom caps in there early, with the opening faced up (of course), and break the egg into that opening so that the yolk settles there with the whites solidifying around it.  It can be amazing if done properly, though I've found that giving it some time under the broiler is the best way to ensure success. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The German Luftstreitkrfte during the First World War rather idiosyncratically permitted its fighter pilots to paint their assigned planes in whatever colour scheme they wished.  While the men of the British Royal Flying Corps, by comparison, were stuck with the standard dun-brownish colour, German planes could be anything from pure white to pure black to pink with green diamonds.  Blue/white stripe jobs were popular, apparently, as were blue/yellow.

It's not entirely clear to me if this doctrine extended to heavy bombers as well, but a great deal of variety was certainly permitted with fighters.  In the case of a pilot like Richtofen, the total lack of camouflage was sort of the point: he wanted his enemies to know he was coming, and to fear the likely consequences.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just how successful or influential was the global protest movement in shaping the course of the Vietnam War? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> That many millions of students, academics, political activists and other people protested American involvement in Vietnam is one of the most widely known and proverbial features of that war -- but what impact did it actually have? I have read breathless accounts of various protests, marches, sit-ins, teach-ins, civilian congresses, conferences, and goodness knows how many other things... but missing from many of these narratives is any reliable sense of just how effective any of it all was.

I'm as interested in broad strokes as I am in individuals, here. I know that U.S. National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, for one, did sometimes participate in debates and discussion with protesting groups and individuals. Do we have any record on whether or not it helped shape his thought on American involvement in the war? What about Robert McNamara, who seems to have remained comparatively more disengaged from such protests?

This is probably a hopelessly broad question, but I'm intrigued nonetheless. The protest movements of the 60s and 70s are frequently recollected as being heroic and important -- but does this stand up under scrutiny? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The rise of China, the popularity of it in India...

This is in part what inspired the question, actually; a friend of mine was telling me that apparently Macallan has been facing shortages on its 15 and 18 stock, in part due to the increasing demand for it in China.  This has evidently led to their relatively new line of Amber, Gold, etc. products, which are still "somewhat expensive" while not being aged to anything like the standard of what they're best known for.  I'm not sure if this is entirely true, but it made me think.

It would be an interesting business to be in, in any event. </TEXT>
