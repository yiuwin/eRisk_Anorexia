	<TEXT> Yes, but I bring up Menuhin since he is widely regarded as the perfect example of the "wonder child" and was already performing with various major orchestras before the age of 14. I don't have the direct quote (from "The Art of the Violin"), but even Ida Haendel described Menuhin as having "already mastered the great violin concertos" in his adolescence. 

Needless to say, every performer constantly gets better, constantly finds something new in a piece, and to withhold them from embarking on this great journey is greatly detrimental.  </TEXT>
