	<TEXT> I was stick thin growing up and I was bullied a couple years in school.   The fat kids I can remember (there were like 2 because obese people were not as common) were not picked on.   One was dick and the other was kinda just not noticed.   This is a small sample size so take it with a grain of salt, but it defeats a notion as silly as saying that skinny people cannot be bullied worse than fat people.   Anyone can be bullied.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I couldn't get past the into.  I was on the fence because i had mixed feeling about BL2 because the gameplay was great but the writing made me cringe every 5 minutes.  The effect seems to have doubled for the pre sequel.

Where the first borderlands was fun, gritty and a little dark.  It just has been reduced to a 5 year giggling because someone says taint or ass every 5 seconds.  If you don't care about the writing or can just mute it, it's the same exact game with characters you didn't ask for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it helps I will say that warlords of draenor is disappointing and it felt like they wanted to make it to where much top level content can be pugged.  But wow used to be pretty challenging.   Ulduar was probably the best example of how raiding should be done.   Since then it had slowly been progressing to cinematic over innovation.  No offense is taken.   It's my opinion and it's based in my experience.   Using a bit of exaggeration for humorous effect does not change it.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was server 2nd twin kill.   4 other raid groups downed it on my server before the nerf. It was an intensely challenging fight thathad little to do with great gear   I stopped playing after getting to turn 8 on coil.  I went back to wow which had turned into a Facebook game (which was fun for a bit)  and some pretty uninspired raid fights.   Furnace and black hand were ok, preceded by don't stand in bad/ gear check fights.   Mythic wasn't out yet, but I did some high maul mythic which were largely gear check versions of the hm.  They were hard of course, but nothing mind blowing.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never thought I'd see someone say that wow raids are more complicated than ffxiv.  The most recent raids are designed so that just about anyone can succeed in wow.  All content is very forgiving to mistakes.   Whereas the first turn off of coil remained untoppled for months on my old server due to having fights that forgave no mistakes.   Wow is more like "lol half the people died.   That's OK.   They were the carries". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's more annoying when there is a clear embellishment.  It's like talking to someone who is telling an interesting story, but they throw in a fact that can't possibly be true and then tries to back pedal and just won't admit the story is bs.  Something to this effect is probably what bothers people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Muslims allowed other religions, but there was non-muslim tax.  That's the biggest issue I know of concerning your question.  This served more to convert than cause unrest though.  Muslim rule was pretty cool with all the prophetic religions (christianity and judaism).

Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure Islam was pretty prosperous and worry-free until this century.

*edit* last century </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I've read about battles, they aren't always two sides of well armed troops.  Sometimes it is literally a farmer in his normal clothing with his sharpest tool.  Maybe some of these stories of "heroic knights" is some extremely decked out gear cleaving through a small group of peasants like it's nothing.

Of course, it would also make sense that there were a lot more people who were extremely proficient with the current weapons of the time.  The same way you kind find people today who are like surgeons with firearms. </TEXT>
