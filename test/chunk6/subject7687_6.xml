	<TEXT> Thank you for your concern and honest advice! 


I guess I should have been more clear. The loan I took out was for my university tuition, and I hadn't intentionally sought out to take out more than I needed to cover just for the tuition. 


I got a scholarship this school year which paid off a chunk of my tuition that I accidentally didn't take into account correctly when calculating how much of the loan I should have accepted. Turns out the scholarship paid a good portion of my tuition, then the loans paid off the rest and I was left with around 800 dollars extra that they put into my bank account. 


We decided we would use that money to finance his trip here, and that we would both save up as much as we can to rebuild the money we used. 


Thank you for the encouragement! </TEXT>

I understand where they're coming from too with being concerned about the money, but I know this is the right thing for me to do because I honestly can't bear the thought of being without him for another year or however how long.


I agree with you that the experiences that I'll have with him are gonna be what I remember when I look back on my life. :)


Thanks for the encouragement!

	<TEXT> You're so hard on yourself and it's really heart breaking!


 Honestly I know you've heard it all, and you've probably heard this one too, but you gotta learn to love yourself first, before you go and meet someone you're gonna wanna potentially love. Being in a relationship when you're not even happy with yourself will be even more nightmarish than being alone when you're dissatisfied with yourself. You're going to want to derive so much of the love and validation that you're craving from them, and then either a) they won't be able to give into your emotional demands, or b) you will reach a cognitive dissonance where the amount of love and attention they give you won't be congruent to the amount you think you deserve (because you're so used to hating yourself so much and feeling undeserving about everything). 


Don't be so hard on yourself, seriously! Like other people have pointed out, a relationship won't magically solve all your problems. It might just make it worse or more complicated.  </TEXT>

I just really liked that route because of the inclines and terrain. And jeez! That sounds really frightening, especially at just 16. I never understood why people think it's okay to try to approach someone from the inside of their car! It instantly makes my heart beat really fast. 


And thank you! Cheers to that! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like a lot of girls, I was always brought up to be extra vigilante about my surroundings by my dad. He was never really around when I was a kid, but he made sure I understood what boundaries to keep with strangers and who to trust and etc. 


He still does this now. Ever since I've been running outside alone, he's been making sure to warn me about things I should look out for.


He warned me a few times about not taking the same route everyday when I run, because people start to notice and it would be easy to target someone who you know when/where they'll be most of the time. 


He's been a little concerned because recently, there was a guy he heard about that was arrested for raping/murdering women pretty close by.


Anyways, I've always taken my dads warnings with a grain of salt. I always thought that maybe he was a little too paranoid about people.


There was one incident that happened a few years ago while I was running on the street that left me pretty shaken that I never told him about (he'd just freak out whenever I run in the street if I told him) but other than that, I've always felt pretty safe running outside, since I always try to go in the day time or when it's busy outside. 


That was until yesterday. 


I don't really know what to make of if and I'm trying to figure out if this was just something that just happened where someone was just trying to be friendly and I'm just being paranoid about their intentions or if I should start changing my running route?


Well, I was running the same route I take when I run outside and it was pretty busy outside and the sun was out, so I was feeling pretty good because I hadn't run outside the whole week (the weather has been pretty sucky recently). 


I make it to the top of this hill when a car drives by with this guy waving his hands trying to get my attention. 


He's yelling something, and I'm squinting trying to figure out if I know this person. He's driving a black escalade with these tinted windows. I don't know anyone who drives that. I don't know him, so I keep running. 


I'm a little worried as he stops his car in the middle of the street and gets out still waving his arms and yelling at me. Then he does a U-turn and parks at the street where I know I'll have to run back through when I'm returning to my house. I start getting a flutter in my stomach. Why was he waiting there?


But I have my boyfriend on the phone and let him know what's going on, it's still pretty busy outside, but the street he's waiting at can be pretty quiet, so my suspicion alarm goes off. 


Anyways, I decide to keep running my route, I'm not about to let this guy ruin my run. Eventually, I make it back to the street that I know he had stopped at, but maybe it was just a coincidence he stopped there and he had left? Then I see his car. He's still there. He drives up close to me and yells, "HEY! Hey! I see you running outside all the time!" 


At this point I'm flustered that he was still there waiting. He knew my route and how long it would take for me to get where. I do a mental face palm as I remember what my dad always told me to do. Never run the same route every day!! I feel like an idiot. 


I can only stammer out a pathetic "Um hi" as I try to run out of that eerily quiet street as fast as possible. 

He slows down his car and looks me up and down and repeats, "You always run through here! I always see you! Maybe you can run with my friend some time." He has this thick Arabic or middle eastern or almost russianish accent. 


I feel so confused but blurt out, "Ok! Bye!" and dash out of there as fast as I can. 


As I run farther and farther away, I get upset with myself. Maybe I shouldn't have been so rude? Maybe he was just a lonely person, coming from a different country who was just trying to make friends? The more I think about it, the more stupid I feel for acting so rash and suspicious about a person who seemed just like an overly friendly man. 


At the same time, I get the nagging feeling that I really should start changing my running route. It really did creep me out that this person had been watching me run and knew where I run and which streets I stop at and could calculate where I would be when he stopped his car at that street.


TwoXchromosomes? Am I being too suspicious/paranoid? Do you think this guy was just trying to be friendly and all the years of my father's warnings have finally got to my head?

Should I start changing my running route? To any of you lady runners, who run alone, is this something you make sure to do?


**TL;DR was stopped by a man in suspicious looking tinted window car who knows my running route and don't know whether to keep running the same route or not**

	<TEXT> The only thing I know that can treat both depression and a low libido is exercise. Maybe you can encourage her to do that, since she's trying to self treat? Or maybe do fun, quick exercises with each other to get her pumped up or motivated to try it?

I have bipolar disorder and when I get depressed, it's really severe. I just lay in bed and sometimes can't even move, but the second I force myself to get up and exercise, there's a complete shift in mood, attitude and my libido soars through the roof. 


Getting her heart rate up and then back down through exercise can also do wonders for her anxiety. It can also make her more relaxed through modulation of her cortisol (stress hormone) levels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> oooohhhhhhhhh that's a tough one. 


I guess the very best thing I'd advise if you so choose to stick it out with a person with a mood or personality disorder is to be very patient. Extremely patient. People with these kinds of disorders have (as you may imagine) very dynamic shifts in behavior that maybe contingent upon little, tiny, miniscule details that matter a great deal to them, but wouldn't cause such an intense response in the average person. So try to be patient by recognizing that a lot of the time, their changes in mood an behavior will be due to illogical reasons or irrational assumptions on their part, NOT your own doing. 


Once you realize this, and stop wondering "What happened? What did I do that was wrong? Why does this person hate me so much?" it'll be easier to handle, since you'll understand that 90% of the time, it isn't actually your fault!

Also, give them space. Especially when they start freaking out. Don't try to smother them with reassurances if the are screeching out verbal assaults at you. They won't care. At that point you need to stop, walk away from them and let them figure out what's wrong for themselves. Don't let them walk all over you but at the same time don't give them ammunition to use against you by saying something that they can make you feel terrible about. 


The important thing is not to take their "in the moment" verbal rampage as a personal hatred against you. They will say a lot and I mean A LOT of hurtful and mean things. Not trying to make excuses, but most of the time, they will be in a different state of mind and won't realize/care what they say. Typically when they calm down, they'll be surprised by their own behavior. 



Now if you're not actually choosing to be with his person, but are forced to put up with them and their aggressive behavior on day to day basis, I would say to simply try to stay away from them as much as possible! These are not people who you want to forge a relationship with or start drama with! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm honestly still trying to figure that part out!


 The best advice I can give to someone who might be going through  similar aggressive mood swings is to be self reflective. Introspect on what's really bothering you. Is it really the other person/situation that's gotten you feeling so upset or is it a feeling of disappointment or restlessness in yourself? 


I know when I start lashing out against someone I'm close to,  it's because I'm not feeling satisfied with myself and so I project my frustrations onto them without addressing the real problem. 


Also, exercise. I don't know where I'd be without my running! It's really helped me a ton with my problems. If you're not a big exercise fanatic, just do whatever you really enjoy that relieves your stress! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, sorry if this is tmi, but while on my period, I realized this week that my whole body is super sensitive. Especially my nipples! I didn't realize it before, because I don't like to...do anything while on my period. 


Anyways, I was laying in bed when I felt my nipple rubbing against my shirt and it felt amazing. That's how it started. Soft rubs and tweaks here and there and literally a minute later my whole body felt like it was on fire and I didn't even get downstairs yet! It was so awesome! I never thought just your nipples could make you orgasm but that will be my next goal :D

TL;DR doing stuff while on your period is totally worth it! Especially if your boobies are sensitive.  </TEXT>
