	<TEXT> Two masons named Diablos and Reznikoff were working at the University of Toronto during the 1850s. Both were in love with the same woman and fought resulting in the death of Reznikoff. It was said that he haunted U of T until the remnants of a body, which had a stonemasons emblem on the belt buckle and believed to be Reznikoff were found after a fire.

	<TEXT> In the summer of 1847 almost 1000 Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine died of typhus in makeshift "fever sheds" located at the corner of John and King streets where the TIFF Lightbox is now located. Many of these people were buried near St. Paul's Basilica at Queen and Power Street. Bishop Michael Power (whom Power Street was named after) also contracted this disease and died while caring for the sick. 

The bodies of the Irish immigrants are now located under the parking lot adjacent to St. Paul's school and are marked by a plaque. Michael Power is buried in the crypt below St. Michael's Cathedral Basilica on Bond Street. Artifacts from the fever sheds can be found in the library at the TIFF Lightbox building.

Somebody has major problems with identity and sexual identity. (e.i. They're transsexual) 

Trevor's character is not a transsexual. He's transgender.

How much you wanna bet they were sexually abused? Yeah... That's like an ingredient to be a transsexual person. 

I believe these statements are incorrect and ill-informed. Do you have any links to published research studies that support these claims (i.e., that transsexuality is "caused" by sexual abuse? And that this is a "no brainer"?)

Basic psychology. 

If by basic psychology you mean an introductory course on the subject could you please provide references to these courses that cover the "causes" of transsexuality?

	<TEXT> There's a difference between intellectual IQ and emotional IQ. We know Lip has the former but we've seen many times where he lacks in the latter. I don't think one necessarily has to have had the life Lip had to be where's he's at emotionally but it certainly didn't help. He's medicating his feelings with sex and alcohol, to deaden his emotional pain because he lacks the skills to find ways to have his emotional needs met in more mature and healthy ways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, we all know how "Romeo and Juliet" ended!

I'm indifferent about Jimmy so I don't really have a horse in the race as the saying goes. 

I think the actor is pretty busy but it seems like he enjoyed being on the show and would fit it into his schedule if he was offered an opportunity to return. It also seems like he's well liked by the producers so it looks they would support writing him back in. 

But I think if they were smart they'd look at the reaction by the viewers to their attempts to close Mickey and Ian's storyline very closely before bringing Jimmy back. It needs to be done in a realistic and ultimately satisfying way that serves both the storyline and the viewers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have many robocalls from the Toronto Police Association as well as an invite to a town hall meeting by phone, which I did not participate in. I think in the two messages they've left on my machine (the others since the town hall are all hang ups) they said something to the effect that budget cuts will force them to let go of 500 officers and this will impact the community in terms of either response time or crime going up (I can't recall which as I've read articles about this elsewhere as well). 

I'm not very sympathetic. I think they are being very manipulative, using scare tactics and could reduce their budget with other cuts. How about each officer taking a proportional pay cut across the board that could cover the shortfall? I'm sure there are other ways they could reduce their costs.

If she Tweeted this, it's confirmed by the network. She would not do that if it weren't.

"Showtime had no comment following Rossums tweet, so a renewal for Season 8 has not been made official. But, its safe to assume the show has been picked up  why else would Rossum and Macy be negotiating for future seasons? Insiders previously told Variety that the Season 8 renewal was being held up solely because of Rossums contract negotiations. Now that her deal is closed, a formal renewal should be announced by the cable network shortly"

Literally nobody is circumcised in Ireland so it feels like the Gallagher's have been far from Ireland for quite a while. (Centuries) 

Most of the Irish in America immigrated during the Potato Famine in the 1840s. Because there was such a large influx (about one million in total left the country but I don't what percentage ended up in the US) they were treated very poorly: called names like "dirty Irish", endured stereotypes like being drunks or lazy, ridiculed for being Catholic and were discriminated against by companies who hung signs, 'No Irish Need Apply". 

But then why does Frank call himself Irish? My ancestors are British but I don't call myself British.

Many people of Irish heritage maintain pride for having endured a lot of hardship. Hence the St. Patrick's Day celebrations and parades that still take place today even though people of Irish descent are now well integrated. So basically when Frank says he's Irish it comes from a place of pride.

Why they go completely against what they were brought up with?

Circumcision nowadays is mainly done for medical reasons (it's supposed to be more healthily as in you're less likely to contract sexually transmitted infections). 

If a male child is born in a hospital chances are it was done automatically. This has been changing recently though. I know some parents who were asked if they want it done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In this article the following example is provided, "Greys Anatomys Ellen Pompeo was paid the same as male lead Patrick Dempsey before he exited the series despite his higher starting point based on his resume". I think it's interesting that they received the same amount of money. I don't think Pompeo had many acting credits when the show started but Dempsey did as he was a former child (teenaged?) star. He certainly had name recognition.

Also this quote, "Rossum has an argument about asking for more pay than Macy as she has had more screen presence lately and she carries many of the shows main storylines" provides an example of how 'carrying the show' can be interpreted. This concept has been debated in many of the threads on this subject in this sub over the past few days. </TEXT>

Here's another article that explains a bit more about the show's history of pay increases for the actors:

http://www.indiewire.com/2016/12/shameless-emma-rossum-equal-pay-1201756281/

I found this quote interesting:

if Rossum closes her deal, producer WBTV then will renegotiate with the remainder of the cast, including Jeremy Allen White (Lip), Cameron Monaghan (Ian) and Steve Howey (Kevin).

I think Shanola Hampton who plays V deserves as much money as Kev. I know he's popular because of his comedic contributions but V is also very important with respect to her friendship with Fiona.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have fond memories of buying candy canes around this time of the year to consume while studying for finals as an undergrad. I still look to buy them every year but it's becoming increasingly difficult. 

One excellent source was Laura Secord's. I think there's still a store at Yonge/Eglinton and maybe one in the financial district but these locations aren't good for me.

Although I don't frequent corner stores very often it seems like years since I've seen any candy canes sold there. 

A few years ago Loblaws sold some very good but very expensive ones but I haven't seen these recently either.

I guess there's always Bulk Barn but I suspect they only sell the thin, cheap, small ones.

Any suggestions? </TEXT>

I hear it's getting cancelled after this season. Nothing final yet but going by ratings and such I think it will be, It probably doesn't help the ratings going up against Westworld, at least for live TV ratings. 

As noted below Showtime has just announced the cancellation of Masters of Sex. That show had finished airing it's fourth (now last) season in November. This season had a reduced number of episodes (from 12 to 10) and was no where near as popular as Shameless. 

I think if Shameless is to finish its run the producers will likely get some warning from Showtime, perhaps a season with a reduced number of episodes with a chance to wrap up the storyline. 

I don't know the ratings for either show but I can't help but think if they gave Masters of Sex the opportunity to go out on their own terms Showtime will do the same for Shameless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically what Banting et al did but a few years later:

"On Jan. 23, 1923, Banting, Collip and Best were awarded U.S. patents on insulin and the method used to make it. They all sold these patents to the University of Toronto for $1 each. Later that year, Banting and Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for the discovery of insulin"

	<TEXT> The show really just slowly lost its way after the first season, which was the strongest IMHO. By setting the show in a hospital they provided it with a structure and consistent secondary characters for the main cast to interact with. I know that in real life Masters left the hospital but the writers didn't need to do that in the first season. 

They tried to carry over some of the cast (e.g., Austin Langham, Betty, Barton and Margaret Scully) from this first season but it mostly failed. Viewers spend time investing in a character and their backstory was well as their relationship with the main characters. It can be difficult and disorienting to see the writers basically butcher this. </TEXT>

**Making Cole the father of Alison's baby and not Noah was a bad decision** by the writers imo. And everytime I think about it I just get annoyed at the fact the story didn't need to take that route. 

Maybe they did this to keep Cole in the storyline?  </TEXT>

Sorry if this is a dumb question, but if Alison signed custody papers while in a mental institution while a lawyer was present with Cole and Luisa, why are they saying that she "disappeared" and they couldn't find her?

I'm not so sure she was in a mental institution per se. Did anyone else think, "The Institute" was the same place from last season that Allison went to, sort of like a retreat and that's where Noah showed up (and they had sex outside against the tree)? 

I have to admit that's the first thing that popped into my mind when she called it "The Institute" rather than an institution, hospital or facility. And that she paid them "all the money she had" like she just handed it over to them in advance when she got there unlike being billed as one would if it was a hospital and not a retreat. 

Also the way she was asked, "Did they help you"? as though it seemed possible this place wasn't exactly sanctioned for the kind of care Allison needed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I noticed that in my last re-watch. I had to rewind because I couldn't believe they used a clip from the Toronto Eaton Centre. It's only on the screen for a few seconds. Good catch with the screen grab!

I like to think Shonda used it in this Cristina-centric episode as a nod to Sandra Oh. But Sandra doesn't have strong ties to Toronto (unlike many Canadian performers I don't believe she's ever lived here). Nice touch though.

BTW, Cristina's character has had a few issues with malls. I think there's been at least 3 episodes, this one included in which her character has a storyline that includes the mall, which is very unCristina-like.

Can anyone identify the other episodes in thinking of? </TEXT>

I'm no expert on what type of bugle they used at that time but that one looks a bit too extravagant to be Army issue. It looks more like a band instrument.

	<TEXT> That picture looks photoshopped. The soldier carrying the umbrella is too sharply in focus, especially compared to the other one in the frame. His helmet is different from the soldier in front of him (does it have a Red Cross on it? Is he a medic?). 

Why is he carrying a trombone? Ant soldier who has fought in a war will tell you that you do everything to lighten your load. I doubt umbrellas and musical instruments would be carried around.

I'm interested to hear how deep the dig goes. This  used to be waterfront.

The St Lawrence Market North is located north of Front Street. Infill of the harbour started south of this. There is a memorial plaque describing this on Church Street between Front and The Esplanade that indicates the demarcation point.

According to this (http://www.toronto.ca/311/knowledgebase/70/101000038070.html) section of the Toronto 311 web site you should make the request to the landlord in writing. So you should probably do that if you haven't already.

I'm not sure if the landlord's response of using an electric heater for which the tenant must pay the electricity bill is considered an acceptable solution if heat is included in the rent. I'd assume the 311 staff have dealt with this before and will let you know how to proceed.

I got the impression that she changed it before she started into medicine at all.

Well, that would make things a bit easier except for her undergrad transcripts, which would be in her old name and she would need them to get accepted into med school. I don't know if the name change would be carried over. 

I think the real reason this has been discussed numerous times is because the writers didn't fully think this component of the plot out before writing it. And as a result it just doesn't add up. </TEXT>

http://www.cpso.on.ca/public-register/all-doctors-search

I know someone who changed the spelling of their last name to make it easier to pronounce. When you search this person in this database under their new name it leads to a listing but no reference to the old name. But if you search under the old name they had when their medical license was granted there is a reference to their new name cited as "name change". 

I'm sure there are some women who change or hyphenate their last name when they get married so there's another example. </TEXT>

 Last year they hosted the Toronto food and wine festival. They have also hosted art shows and concerts in the past. 

Thanks for your response. I've lived in this city for 30 years and can't believe I've never been there!

So I should just wait until there's an event that interests me before going or is there enough to do that I could just go and walk around? It's not far from where I live so the travel time is no issue. I like to take photos so I'm assuming there would be the opportunity for that.

Not really sure why Fiona wouldn't have walked Liam to school on his first day of kindergarten. 

I think Fiona, like many parents who have raised multiple children was just slacking off a bit on this one (and it served the storyline about the school being closed so Liam and Frank could discover the private school). 

I know any people who grew up in large families who felt like their parents were tired or had given up on being strict with the youngest ones because it was just too much effort. How many of Fiona's siblings has she walked to school on their first day? For sure Debbie and Carl. Maybe even Ian. If nothing bad happened before she's likely to believe nothing bad will happen now. Also she knows Liam is familiar with the neighbourhood and probably thought it was safe.  </TEXT>
