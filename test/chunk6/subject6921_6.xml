	<TEXT> Yes, he had several hard drives of  child porn. Adding up really fast in court and got him the 15 years. He got way more then I think he deserves tho. But he definitely deserves jail time. Child pornography is very dangerous and wrong </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My cousin got 15 years for having child pornography. He's a nice guy, just had problems and really needed help. He deserved jail time, but 15 years?! And this cop gets 1 year!? I lost a family member and I get so pissed when I see things like this. 

edit: Ok to clear things up. He had multiple hard drives of CP. Was not selling, creating, or directly hurting a child(just looking). From what i know the more  CP you have the longer the sentence (why he got 15 years i guess).if he wasn't caught there is no telling what he might of done later down the road. People with good intentions can get wrapped up with some messed up stuff and end of doing things they never thought they would. Im glad he was caught, but I'm not convinced he should have 15 years. watching CP is an awful crime because it fuels the CP industry and more children are hurt because of it. (watching normal porn does the same btw, the more we watch the more people are forced into it). I think a shorter sentence and rehabilitation would be far more helpful for him tho.

	<TEXT> I adopted about a 6-8month puppy about a month ago. (it might be a year old). so far I've been able to teach her to sit, stay and I'm almost got her potty trained, but one thing i can't do is get her to walk with me without pulling on the leash. Im doing what i read online (stop when she pulls then wait for her to stoping pulling before moving again) and I'm calling her every time she stops to smell something. After a week of doing this i feel no progress. I stop every two steps, she is just not getting it. I live in a apartment complex and I'm kinda worried what people might think of they way I'm walking her. the whole walk is just stop and go and me constantly calling her name.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so back when I was in highschool some of my female Christian friends had tumblrs and would constantly repost attractive males often with no shirts on. Obsessing over certain actors and such... Anyways If i had a Tumblr and did something like that and they found out I would be labeled a pervert and commiting the sin of lust. I know this isnt just in the Christian community either. So what's the difference. Why do girls get by with obsessing over actors or sharing shirtless picture of men? Also women are able to say things like "this is a real man" but hell no, you never set standards a for what a women is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I recently left a job and moved. For the last 2 years I've been waking up at 5:30-6am. Now Im working evening till midnight 5 days a week. Problem is I come home starving and eat then I can't sleep till like 1am. Then there is a good chance I'll wake up at 5:30am and not be able to sleep.even on days off Im staying up till midnight and wakings up as early as 5:30. How do I fall back asleep. I've been laying in bed for almost 3 hours with no luck so I'm just going to get up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> got another question on my tribute page. When I view the page on my phone or shrink the browser the movie list does shrink but the distance between the images grows. Im trying to get the images to be a little larger at phone size and closer together. (for know I'm only using the one photo until i figure it out). id appreciate some feedback on my coding and what i could do differently. (also when i view my page on safari the columns are all off) </TEXT>
