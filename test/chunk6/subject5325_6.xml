	<TEXT> Okay I just checked the prices and I realize it's not that expensive. It's just above a $100 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004NBZAW0) which is a pretty good deal (considering you buy refurbished and not new.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Costlier
2) Not much use if you don't want to pursue a career in science or maths
3) You have to go through the pain of charging instead of just keeping an extra set of batteries. I bought my TI-84 in August 2015 and I haven't had to replace the batteries since then.
4) Too much functionality you won't need or ever use in the Nspire. The TI-84 has all the functions you need for the IB and if there's something you need but don't find pre-installed in your calculator, you can always install it again.
5) Once again - it costs much more.

	<TEXT> Hi! Also in the IB DP program and want to pursue ECE. But so far your grades are good, you'll need to get your SAT scores to really know which schools to apply to for the US.

For the UK, you could try either Oxford or Cambridge (you can't apply to both), Oxbridge, King's College, Edinburgh or Glasgow. All of those are great schools for STEM fields. You could also try your luck at Imperial but you'd need a 40+ to apply there I think. The UK really cares about your predicted grades and your UCAS statement so get on that really quickly. Almost all UK universities will give you only conditional offers based on your predicted grades.

For Canada, definitely try UofT, Waterloo, UBC and McGill (I'm applying to all of those.) A lot of Canada schools offer co-op chances so you can really do hands-on work while also studying, and getting paid. Waterloo has a good rep for the co-op as far as I've heard.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The SL syllabus is a subset of the HL syllabus. There is little no difference. The IA's are graded differently however. You're not required to have as high a level of understanding for SL Maths IA as you would be for an HL one, meaning an essay graded a 4/6 in the criteria for level of Maths in HL would probably be a 6/6 for SL </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am applying for Fall 2017 and so both my friend and I made our accounts at the same time and there was some point where a lot of things went wrong. So now when I login from you.ubc.ca, with MY username and password, it takes me to a page where it greets my friend, let's call him Drake so it says "Hi Drake" instead of my name. But when I access my application from the SSC, it leads me to my application. My friend hasn't got a student number yet and when he logs in with his username, it takes him to this page:

http://imgur.com/8FYRqgy

and then it completely loops back all the time.
We've both contacted support and I think the only solution is for both of us to get our accounts deleted so we can start afresh, because I can't afford to lose my application or his because of a mixup. </TEXT>
