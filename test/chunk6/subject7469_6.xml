	<TEXT> Hi all. I am after a few musicians to play the pokemon theme music at a meetup in Sydney Australia in Hyde park on the 27th July.

I know this is short notice but I didn't think that my event would get as much attention as it did. I just wanted to meet some people from the other teams,  compare pokemons and have a laugh at some crazy catching stories that I am sure people have.

Let me know if you know anyone. 
PM deets.
Cheers </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am in need of a good councelor. I have been in sydney for a few years now and the city is getting to me in a few ways.
My gp diagnosed me with depression.

I have been here before mentally and just need someone professional to talk to. 

I would prefer a man as I feel it is easier to relate. If you know of someone around the city you could recommend that would be really appreciated. Please pm me the details.

Thanks for being an awesome community all. </TEXT>
