	<TEXT> First of all, I'll just apologize for becoming a serial poster here the past few days. I've just been having a hard time, especially on these nights where for the life of me I can't sleep. The support I've felt here has been amazing. THANK YOU all. 


I've met some amazing people here who've given some amazing insight, especially the past few days. I've been trying to take another look at my life and my recovery and really see what needs to be done and what needs to change to be successful this time around. I'm realizing that I have some things in my life that need to be dealt with. It just seems.. so overwhelming. It feels like every tough or painful emotion has been amplified by 100. I guess that's kind of to be expected and a no duh. Take away the numb of drugs and what does that leave you right? I'm having a really hard time dealing with some of these emotions and feelings. It just seems like it's all too much and too heavy all at once. I feel like I can't handle it all on my own. I hate that. I hate feeling this.. weak I guess.


 How did you deal with the first smack in the face by reality after getting clean? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. Really though. Damn. The past few days people on here have managed to find the words that are finally hitting me and making me seriously take a look at my recovery and the direction I'm heading. 

I don't know you personally, but I have so much respect for you. Much love. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's why I love this subreddit. All of the addicts or recovering addicts here are the exact opposite of that quote. Everyone here has proven to be the most amazing support system for me. I now for me personally, I hope each and every person who has ever posted here manages to get clean and STAY clean. And I 100% believe that everyone else here has that same attitude and opinion.

I'm sorry you've had to deal with that from your mom. Just now you've got support here. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Day 7. About to go sit my second final of the  week (and the one I'm most scared of) after almost no sleep. Having A LOT of trouble focusing. I don't remember the mental and emotional wds being this bad before I relapsed. Trying my best to stay positive but I'm quite worried and really, really stressed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh dear God. I hate that movie with a burning passion. It freaks me the fuck out. I had a hard time especially because when I watched it I watched it alone, on my laptop, at about 2:30am. I was also still on heroin. NOT a good idea. I had like a panic attack watching it. I still won't watch it. I think they should just get ride of the anti-drug DARE program and just make people watch that. They'll be so traumatized they'll never fucking touch a thing.

I mean it's well done and all... And if you aren't on drugs it's probably a little easier to stomach. But I struggled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats on your clean time! That's fucking fantastic. :)
And yeah. For the most part everyone here is great. I'm sooo glad I found it. I don't  know if I could make it through nights like I'm having tonight without some people who are willing to listen to me bitch and moan.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. I won't lie, optimism is not always my strong point. Especially on nights like this where I just feel like I can't do it. (Which is really so pathetic. I mean.. what is heroin? a non-living sonofa bitch. How ridiculous is it that I feel like this inanimate object is stronger than me when I am an evolved being with the capability to reason and think for myself?) I'm doing my best to keep my head up. If I can't sleep just tryna find some distraction ya know? Remembering why I NEED to get clean and that this too shall pass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much. I feel ya.. I'm just hoping my brain doesn't decide to finally give out during my final tomorrow. I've never handled stress super well, but for some reason (I guess kind of an obvious reason) it's been completely shutting me down while simultaneously keeping me awake. haha. I don't know. Maybe I'll get lucky and be able to remember something when I'm testing. Positivity right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. God. I don't know why I'm having such a hard night. But it's kicking my ass. This is only my first semester so I mean it's potentially subject to change, but for now I'm doing a double major of international studies and constitutional law. </TEXT>
