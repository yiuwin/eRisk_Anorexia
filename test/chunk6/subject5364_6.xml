	<TEXT> bahahaha, this is something you should NEVER do. Such a sensative topic, for anyone really. But if you're serious you simply need to tell a girl she looks "healthy". Even that could go down pretty bad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I found out adults weren't amazing people. I looked up to my teachers a lot in gradeschool. Almost superhero like, But two teachers would bully this one student teacher and make her cry. I thought adults didn't do that stuff. So I was pretty disapointed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If your not pro something you are usually classified as against something. Gay people are humans, so it's saying your against a certain type of human. Which makes you a douchebag. If you have to go out of your way to say your not pro something it's passive aggressive hate. Like: "im not pro black" I'm not pro abortion" "I'm not pro jewish" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unbotton and whip it out. It seems more diffuclt to unzip the fly then take your weiner out through a mini-maze then reverse mini-maze once your done. Pull down, pull up is much easier.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Avoid it, agree to disagree. Mormon families are strict. Planting atheist seeds every now and then is good enough. Like why should god listen to your prayers instead of a kidnapped child who will be rapped and murdered.  </TEXT>
