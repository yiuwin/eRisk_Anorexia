	<TEXT> Marie Sharp's from Belize is my go to. It's a carrot habanero HS that I feel kind of started to popularize that combo of ingredients. Great balance of flavors. Ring of Fire from 619 is also pretty great. That one is more a of a southwest type of flavor profile, with stronger hints of cumin in it. These are *edible*. Meaning they ain't hot for the sake of being hot like some of the other sauces that got cap oil or oleoresin, or some sort of other pepper extract. Those just get plain ridiculous </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair enough. I totally respect the gesture that you're trying to convey here, it's just that, I feel, that it's become rather futile to look at it that way anymore. Filmmaking and making money off it, in this day in age, has to be adaptive and ever-evolving. If they're smart most of them that have made it this far, will be just fine. 

It's also a very slippery slope to travel when you like movies, like I do, and peruse places such as this sub. But, that's really beside the point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right. It only works with noods made out of rice flour. Noods made out of AP flour or semolina flour don't react for shit. Frying rice noodles can look pretty nice for plate presentations. I've also used rice papers, but they are sometimes a little more finicky and harder to predict the end shape. Source: Work with food and have thrown all sorts of shit in the fryer.

 
E: Come to think of it, you can get a decent fry off of a regular (wheat flour) noodle, if they are thin and cooked in water first. They won't poof up and be as light as rice noodles would be, but they would be somewhat edible. Kind of. Still wouldn't recommend it, though. </TEXT>

But, this story is redundant. It doesn't really shed any light on any of the questions we already wonder about Trump. I see this as becoming a disconcerting pattern with *The Independent*.

	<TEXT> I've been noticing, for a while now, imgur linked posts becoming less of the norm which is fine and all, except that my hover extension (currently Hover Zoom enabled and I've tried another with same results) doesn't work like it should with i.redd.it and i.reddituploads.  
Half the time the shit won't enlarge the thumbnail at all, and the other half of the time it'll just show a same sized duplicate of the thumbnail, effectively doing nada useful.


So, I am wondering if anyone else is having problems using their hover extension on non-imgur linked posts. If so, have you found a decent extension that works with these other hosts?



P.S.  Apologies in advance if this is a commonly asked question. I pretty much just subscribed to be able to ask this question (I guess, I could of lurked around and looked around for a solution, but whatever) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the most part, I think you are right. The thing is, is that I think many of the ideas that the right spout out are also well intended. The idea of strong national security isn't necessarily bad, and the idea of less gov't allowing for more personal freedoms is also, not necessarily a bad one. The way they persistently campaign these ideas; it's not much of a surprise why they are able to garner so much support. Because these ideas make sense. Implementation of said ideas is something entirely different, however.
The problem is that neither party can stick to the essence of what makes their ideas good ones, without pandering to a seeming hidden agenda. This pandering to entities not of the citizenry (citizens united is bullshit), is what often poisons and subsequently tarnishes most platforms from both parties. The drug of choice for the republican politician is often big money and then the fact that their constituency is totally unwilling to see the spade as a spade. They will stick to whatever the lame ass politician tells them.  
The problem for the democratic party is that they just come out looking way to indecisive (often because they have to compromise the progress they ultimately want, because the republicans are so thick headed and afraid of change). And by the time they do come up with an official stance, it will be at odds with the 'essence' of what was told to their constituency but will be agreed regardless, and be touted as something that needed to be done, so as to maintain some semblance of progress and thereby keeping the party breathing. </TEXT>

Looks pretty cool. Not sure, if I'd have the balls (like some in the video) to be running up there, though.

	<TEXT> I agree wholeheartedly. I've always loved that they have never cared enough to have a shtick or take themselves too seriously, but usually the music they write totally says otherwise. Definitely a band I can listen to day in and day out, no matter what the album.

	<TEXT> I know exactly what you mean about them. Oftentimes I think just the sound of their music may invoke a sense of 'non-seriousness' within the listener. But, then if you start paying more attention to Joey's lyrics; shit..he's fuckin great. Sure they've got songs like *Mr. Coffee*, and *Beer Goggles*, but so many more of their songs are way more meaningful. Like off of the same album("Duh" is always gonna be my fave), they've also got songs like *Noble End*, *Angry Days*, *Of Mind and Matter*, and *Bury the Hatchet*.  And this is pretty much the way it's always been with Lagwagon.  
"Duh" may be my favorite album, but "Resolve" is the one I probably think of first.

	<TEXT> I had a hunch that it was some sort of set up around a pool or something. The hose,  and legs propped up like someone laying belly down on a pool chair were clues. As I don't know if I've ever seen a pool with an elevated lip, that's probably what threw me off most. That and that glass.
