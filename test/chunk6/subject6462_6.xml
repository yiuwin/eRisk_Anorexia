	<TEXT> Those are super helpful tips, thank you so much. I don't know that I have the restraint to only do half every three hours (pathetic I know) but I'm going to try the sticky note thing and see if that works! </TEXT>

Soooooo that food and exercise plan that was working for me? Not working anymore. Lol. I spent most of yesterday bingeing on those gd hershey mini chocolates :( it's the damnedest thing... I can eat SO WELL for like almost a week but as soon as the number on the scale starts going down I can't control myself. I feel like maybe I should stop weighing myself for a while but honestly the thought of *not* doing that absolutely terrifies me. I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to be in control. I'm so tired of being a slave to my brain and my cravings.  </TEXT>

My guy had a rough week and is coming over tonight so I'm making his favorite slow cooker dish for dinner. I plan to eat a normal portion but I'm going to try and serve myself less pasta and more chicken.  </TEXT>
