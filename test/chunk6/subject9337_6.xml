	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm constantly anxious and stimulants make me feel better for some reason.  Maybe something to do with how people with ADD take adderal or Ritalin to calm down, dunno. \_()_/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me cigs and vape pens don't really dull my hunger but nicotine patches do a bit, especially when combined with coffee.  I also just really don't like smoking anything though.  I also save all my calories for right before bed.  I have the stimulants in the morning when my stomach is empty so they work better and I can usually get through the day.  Then a couple of hours after I eat at night I take some benedryl to sleep. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would just keep an eye on her, and check in with her doctor from time to time.  Try and be very neutral about it and if it comes to having to make dietary changes do so in a way that doesn't focus on her weight.  

My son is nine and has always been very thin and somehow he already knows what calories are, though doesn't seem concerned by them.  It makes me uneasy because I don't know where he got that knowledge from.  I didn't even think about calories until I was in high school.  A lot of people thinks it's ok to comment on his body because he's thin but I worry about that even.  My weight has fluctuated so much throughout his life and he hasn't said a word about it, so im hoping ignorance is bliss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No clue really but my mom has been a chronic dieter for at least as long as I've been alive, and both parents are at least always aware of their weight and speak about it a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was a very young child I remember my morbidly obese grandmother telling me I was destined to be just like her when I was older.  It terrified me.  Not long after that, she had a major heart attack and almost died.  Since then she's gotten her shit together and is living a long life, (probably longer than mine will be, ha).

Oh and to this day my mom still has a "nothing tastes as good as skinny feels" magnet on her fridge. :') </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking this is one of those things that's misunderstood about people with ED's.  For someone with normal eating habits they're probably like "WHY would an anorexic person be mad about sharing their food?  Then they'd have less!"  It's so frustrating when you've planned everything out and you're like, "I get to have this, I'm allowed to have this much," and then someone eats your food. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have spent a lot of time smoking in parking lots recently!  Sometimes I just have this unexplainable dread about going home.

I've been trying to keep my net calories around 1000 but today I had a ton of protein so I feel really full and slightly sick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh God I feel you about the arms thing.  One of the first physical things that initially attracted me to my boyfriend was how tiny and toned his arms were.  He's only about 2 inches taller than me and while his BMI is several points higher I still feel like he looks thinner than me.  He has a legit thigh gap too.  Mine is so tiny I'm hesitant to even call it a thigh gap. 

 I forget what the context was but one time he said something like "yeah girls always tend to hold onto fat in their upper arms more," which is true and my biggest problem area _  But hey it's cool that we can kind of share clothes, especially because we travel a lot.

He also recently said to me, "If you lose one more pound you're in trouble."  eh...heh heh. -_- </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm for the most part very straight up with everyone in my life and they know that I'm going to eat when and what I feel like.  The only person I'm weak against when it comes to food is my boyfriend's dad.  He takes a lot of pride in his cooking and sometimes I stay at his house for long stretches of time and the last thing I want to do is seem ungrateful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of weird but I do the opposite.  I always buy clothes a bit bigger than I need them because I don't trust myself to maintain or lose weight.  I like shirts baggy anyway and with pants I almost always use belts.  I think I have one pair of pants that only start to get baggy when I'm below 100 pounds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, photos are so weird because I feel like I could look completely different in every one.  Lighting, angles and optical illusions makes such a big difference in how someone looks in a photo.  It's not even just me, I notice there are "bad" pictures of other people, where it's obvious they look better in real life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I think they do for most of their clothes.  It's difficult to find pants there that are small enough now.  Sucks because I love target it's my go-to for everything. :D  They have some pretty cute stuff in the boys section right now though.  Pretty soon I'm going to be sharing a wardrobe with my 9 year old. _ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly it's probably because fat people don't really use pictures of obese people as "goals" for them to like...reach that high weight or whatever.  Thinspo is often used as a tool to push yourself to make your body look like theirs.  I don't think most fat people are actively TRYING to put on more and more weight to look like some "fatspo" they saw on tumblr.  It's more of a body pride or fashion thing.  Not saying it's right, but that's probably the main difference between the need for warnings. </TEXT>
