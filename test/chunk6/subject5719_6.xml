	<TEXT> Does Em still hate his dad's guts? The older he gets the more and more mature he becomes so I was just wondering what you guys think about his feelings for his dad. I mean we've all seen that letter his "dad" wrote to him, but I just wanted to gather your opinions on this. 

P.S. Could the father/son theme be one for his next album? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A song about some bagpipes that young Marshall found sitting around one day and when he asked his mom about about it, she said his fagdad (*get it* baghdad = fagdad) left them as a way to remember him. Only reason he didn't use fagdad in the title of the song is because Baghdad is his favorite city in Iraq and that rhymed with fagdad.

Sorry, I tried. </TEXT>
