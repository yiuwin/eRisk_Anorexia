	<TITLE> Enemy cast bar for PVE </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> While implementing cast bar for PVP and WvW would change the game balance immensely, i don't see that much downside if it were PVE.

Casting animation is often too underwhelming and goes unnoticed by most player, espeically in big zerg. Having a cast bar would encourage players to play around them with interrupt mechanic or dodge roll, leading to more build variety in open world. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do i stop two specific programs from interacting with each other. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-13 19:57:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am using a program called Unikey which enables me to type in Vietnamese. One thing it does is that it turns "w" into "" automatically, you have to type the key twice to get "w". And that specific function is interfering with my input while i use other programs. Mostly when i play games and use "w" to move, the games would recognize the input as "".

So how do i stop Unikey from interfering with my games ? Since i need it up all the time, the problem gets way too annoying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "I had so many expectation, you seriously disappointed me" my mentor said this to me yesterday. I was top in class, got into a very prestigious university in my country, had lots of thing planned out for my 4 years. I was always positive and proud of myself. Until my bestfriend stopped being my bestfriend.

He and i were really closed, we even lived together. I wasn't outgoing so he was basically my only friend, the closest person i had got. We were an open book to each other and shared everything( well, almost everything). Then one day i realized i was having affection for him. I hid that from him for a year. When i finally gathered the strength to tell him, i expected a "Sorry i only see you as friend.", but instead, he seemed freaked out, digusted even. He said he didn't feel comfortable being my friend, so he started looking for somewhere else to live, and stopped talking to me.

My sense of self was destroyed because of that. For the first time in my life, i was ashamed of myself, insecured, and started to doubt everything i did. I began to compare my life to his and others, and see how i could never have a normal happy life like them, with a wife, a family, and respect from people around me. Then i started smoking, drinking, skipping classes and basically screwed my first year.

(-TLDR) Honestly i don't want to go on anymore. If my bestfriend can't accept me, who will. Everything i am doing right now is just mindlessly running forward, without a goal. My life now is a huge mess with horrible first year gpa and my drinking, smoking habit. I really need some help right now.

Ps: The statement from my mentor might seem insensitive, but i haven't told her about my bestfriend situation yet (afraid that she might act the same)

	<TEXT> 1. Got hit on for the first time ( and so many times after that ) when i came out at 19, felt like late puberty lol.

2. Roadmap for straight relationship mostly doesn't apply to me, realized that fact too late after having followed it for such a long time. Every one of my date is undiscovered ground.

3. How i hate being call "Gay". Idk, i absolutely don't have any denial about my sexual orientation, but i prefer being known as just another normal guy, rather than "that gay dude" .

4. I thought it would be really hard to find a bottom because i just assumed every other guys hate being bottom.

5. Having a penis for more than twenty years, i thought i would know how it would feel to touch someone else's dick. NOPE. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have played PoE for a while now but being pretty casual, it seems like 50% of the game is still unknown to me. I don't know which skills go well with each other, how much life is enough for a life build, what defensive mechanism should you choose for a build...etc. And the idea of making builds seems exciting but almost impossible for me since i have zero knowledge on the pattern of the passive tree.
I would love to know if there is any guide out there that teach you those things. </TEXT>
