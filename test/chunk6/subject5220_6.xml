	<TEXT> True, but I think companies will want some evidence that you can draw people before they had something over. 

Put together some informative\entertaining reviews of components you've already got is one idea. I doubt anyone is going to give or loan components just because OP has said he wants to review them. 

A magazine has an expected readership, which will convince manufacturers to send them bits for review. Same with Toms Hardware. Without that expected audience, can't see anyone offering something for nothing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're going to have to persuade either online shops, or gpu manufacturers, to loan you cards. Thry, in turn, will want some proof of predicted viewing figures to make it commercially sound. Can you show 500,000 youtube views or site visitors? What about examples of previous benchmark studies you've done? 

If you can't provide the above, on what basis should these companies provide you with loan cards for testing?

	<TEXT> I think [toffeeface](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pvbyq/what_do_you_think_was_the_worst_book_adaption_to/cd6iohw) had it right above; would have been better if they did a mini series of the book - would have suited the episodic nature a lot better. 

I have seen mentioned in this thread, though, that the film was done as a prequel to the book, and there might (only a rumour as far as I could tell) be a second film in the works, which would cover the book. No idea how correct\likely this is though!

The book was certainly rich though, you're right! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Build Help] Quadro   GTX in same machine </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-04 23:01:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm acquiring the bits for my new machine and have a question about running a Quadro K2000 I have alongside a GTX (looking at a GTX770). 

I will be alternating between gaming and 3d modelling (Autodesk Maya). 

I've already got a 4770K, along with the Quadro K2000D. Really, I just wanted to hear if anyone else is successfully running a Quadro series card alongside a GTX before I buy my mobo, case etc, and how they are finding it - any problems to be aware of, or process for setting the primary card when modelling\gaming etc. 

Welcome any advice\thoughts on the matter! Thanks in advance </TEXT>

	<TEXT> House was broken into by some mental woman looking for retribution against my flat mate, who was sensibly not there. I called the police whilst she was busting the door down. Police turn up, mob handed (like 4 patrol cars), and rush in. Detain crazy woman and bundle her off. I'm somewhat a bag of nerves, and having to give a run down of what happened to a couple of police in the living room. As I'm explaining to them, I notice a lump of dope on the sofa next to me (I say lump, it was probably a couple of grams tops), and stealthily shifted over and sat on it to hide it. Finished off talking to the cops who thanked me for my time and made to go. First cop walks down the hall to leave, the second one turns to me as he's leaving, grins, and comments "Just a friendly tip, but next time you call the cops, you might want to clean up any incriminating evidence beforehand", and glances at the sofa. I nervously chuckled, thanked him and that was that. 

Close escape.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a healthy respect for the power, and ability to turn me into chunky niblets, of bears and sharks. But the animal that scares me the most is undoubtably the [Tarantula Hawk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula_hawk); a spider hunting wasp that preys on, you guessed it, Tarantulas. It doesn't even sneak up on them either, it hunts them them down, and then fucks them up in [face to face combat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJFzNr5YL4). 

And that's not even the worst part. Once it's immobilised the Tarantula (which they frequently do), it drags it back to it's nest, injects it with an egg, and leaves its young to gestate and grow inside, eating the helpless arachnid from the inside out.

	<TEXT> There are only around 8 parts to your average computer, and they make it almost impossible for you to connect them the wrong way around. 

* Case
* Power supply unit (PSU)
* Motherboard
* Processor (CPU)
* Memory (RAM0
* Graphics card (if you don't have this built into the motherboard, which is fine for some builds)
* Hard drive
* Optical drive (cd\dvd)

All of these make up your average computer. Plug in your keyboard, mouse and monitor and there you are.

	<TEXT> First of all, if there is any danger from overheating, your motherboard will alert you via some loud beeps. TBH, there is unlikely to be any issue from having the cooler slightly askew like that. 

Try booting up into the BIOS and looking for a hardware monitor option. This will give you a CPU temp read out; watch this for a few minutes. Does it seem stable? Keep on watching, leave it on for 30 mins or longer if poss, read a book and keep an eye on the temps. 

This should give you an idea of whether there is likely to be an issue. I'm using a monstrous Thermaltake cooler with one of the mb (physical)  connectors having falled off; it's held on with 3 of the 4 clips, and works fine, no cooling issues at all. So really, it is very unlikely that you'll be able to heat damage your CPU; you'll get plenty of warnings before that is likely to happen, giving you plenty of time to shut the system down.

	<DATE> 2013-10-02 14:49:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Had this problems many times, in various versions of Maya. I rarely use SubDs to haven't looked into why it's occuring. However I'm determined to get to the bottom of this issue for once!

When converting between Poly and SubD objects and back again, face (and possible edge) normals start misbehaving. [Few images here](http://imgur.com/a/AaHED) illustrate the issue. 

Now I can easily solve this by just selecting the object and then "Set faces to normal", but I'm sure there must be some option I've missed, or something in my workflow, to be causing this. So, has anyone experience of this issue, or have any ideas why it's occuring? 

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Build Help] Turning old gaming rig into a NAS\RAID box </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-17 14:16:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm looking to build myself a new gaming\work rig in the near future, and want to do something useful with my current build and turn it into a NAS. I have 3 x 2TB drives I can use. 

Basic specs of my existing setup are

*  ASUS P5Q-E motherboard
*  4 GB (4x1GB)
*  Intel Q9650 CPU
*  GTX460 video card
*  OCZ modular 600W PSU
*  Gigantic thermaltake volcano (or similar) cooler\heatsink

Now for this NAS, I realise that low power is desirable, as well as low noise. So I figure I sell the CPU (with cooler) and video card, and go for a low power CPU instead, and this is where I could do with some tips. This box will mainly be used for household backup and media streaming, but am open for other uses as well. Would something like a E8400 cpu be enough\overkill\underpowered for my needs, and still running at a low enough power rating to need a smaller heatsink? 

I've also got an old GTX260 and a GTS250, which I've never used (spares from a friend), but they look still quite beefy. MB has no onboard, so my options are to use one of these cards, or sell them and get a dirt cheap PCI graphics card instead. 

Would welcome any thoughts on the above! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! Whisky books are a good idea; I actually have a couple of old whisky compendium books somewhere that should have overviews of some of the whiskies will be trying, and maybe something on the distilleries too - like it!

I was planning on getting some oatcakes in; apparently they're quite good at neutralising the palate between tastings. Good point on the glasses though, not even though of that. I have got 9 litres of highland spring mineral water in just to keep with the general Scottish theme, so plenty to rinse glasses out as well as for drinking. 

I've even got some pipettes for adding water a drop at a time to any drams should folks wish; picked up a few at the Whisky Exchange a few years ago and found them really useful. 

Thanks for the tips! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great, that tasting\nosing chart looks just the ticket, cheers :-) Lots of nice descriptive text there that we can use! 

You're right, the lineup is very much with an Islay slant, which I'm afraid is my doing and is generally reflective of my collection. In fact, the snow phoenix is probably the only non-peated one I own, although the Leif Erikson doesn't have a lot from memory. 

I'll resist buying any more bottles at this stage; this evening is to try and help clear some shelf space so I'll have to stick with the Islay focus for this one. 

Here's my [current drinking shelf](http://i.imgur.com/LwZFTox.jpg), sans the Bruichladdic Waves and the Snow Phoenix; you can see there is a definite Islay bias! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've invited a 5 friends over this weekend for some whisky tasting. Some of them have a tipple occasionally, but nothing specific. I'm looking for any feedback on my plans for the evening, and the scotches I'm going to break out. Not worked out any order yet, except for having the stronger, Islay beasts at the end. 

* Glenfiddich Snow Phoenix
* Bruichladdich Organic 2003
* Highland Park Leif Erikson
* Bruichaddlich Waves
* Jura Prophecy
* Ardbeg Uigedail
* Laphroaig Cairdeas 2010
* Laphroaig QC (Possible)

I was thinking of doing some group-reviews as well possible. Get some simple review sheets printed up for folks to jot their thoughts down. I'd like to have a sheet of some key words that can prompt people to comment on flavours\smells\sensations etc, rather than feeling a bit lost. Does such a thing exist? 

I'm going to show folks this video beforehand as a primer for whisky tasing too. [HP Tasting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boj33DVSILQ)

edit: The whiskies above I've chosen as they're mostly the ones I have open at the moment. I am thinking of breaking out one of the nicer bottles I've had hanging around, but there are mostly Islay, with a few HP specials thrown in (Earl Magnus   Thor). 

Anyway, wondering if anyone has any tips or thoughts they could share to help the evenings planning! Thanks in advance :-) </TEXT>
