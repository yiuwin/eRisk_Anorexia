	<TEXT> Bra is a shortened version of the word "brassiere," which has its origin as a Norman word for a child's undershirt. Hence singular. 

Panties are small pants. "Pants" are a shortened version of "pantaloons." Pantaloons take their name from the Commedia dell'arte character Pantaloon who in turn gets his name from the Italian martyr "Pantaleon" (Pan = all, Leon = lion) who survived seven execution attempts by the Roman authorities.

Edit: just seen which sub this was posted in, I'm still leaving my original comment up as I wouldn't class this as a *joke*. </TEXT>
