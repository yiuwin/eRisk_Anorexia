	<TEXT> I understand people will say the dog is running like that because it hasn't been exercised properly, but all dogs get like that. Like humans get hyper, as do dogs too. 

My parents have a wolfhound called Buzz ( Buzz because he decided it was sensible to roll in semi warm tar which stuck to his fur requiring a buzz cut ) which has made a track in the front garden around a tree because he likes to run. He gets a two hour walk daily..  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can anyone explain what this has to do with Podesta? 

The videos seem like they've been made by some guy who's a bit upset with his life   rants about it by leaving witty songs with lyrics about hanging himself or shooting his wife   kids. 

There are some videos that have some distressing audio on but nothing that shows any visible proof that children are getting treated incorrectly. 

This to me feels like an art project of some kind, if it was going to be a leak of information I don't think it would be needed to hide it amongst all of the other strange material.  </TEXT>

Relating to true skill I'm gutted. It's always fun to try and see how good you are against the masses especially early on! I hope when they refer to post release it's a week max..  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do people not know the history of Iran? Back before 1979 it was to be considered like that of Europe, The Uk or even USA. Women didn't have to wear any form of headdress, their was no major religion. 

In 1979 there was a revolt between a few groups of people and the religious people snapped up the country after the civil war. After 1979 it was declared an Islamic state! 

It's not a place of doom   gloom, quite a nice place to visit! </TEXT>
