	<TEXT> It's the only job so far that doesn't make me miserable to get out of bed in the morning. 

To some degree, I get paid to have new experiences and continually challenge myself in writing, ideas and creativity. Journalism also pushes me to improve on my weaknesses, like socializing and connecting with others. 

Before this I was working various jobs. I bounced around, got customer complaints, got fired from a few places. I was bored and depressed. News is where I believe I belong.  </TEXT>
