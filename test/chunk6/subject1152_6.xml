	<TEXT> It's amazing mixed with cottage cheese.  I've been doing this with trader joe's pumpkin butter and it seriously tastes like pumpkin pie.  I've been using small curd, but it would probably be even better with large curd.  Obviously,  this only applies if you are dairy friendly. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Running on a reconstructed knee </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I had major acl reconstructive surgery 4 years or so ago.  Before this, I was extremely active in sports and general working out.  I rehabbed completely and was cleared to return to sports.   Since then, I fell off the running/ exercise wagon for a few years and have only within the past month gotten back into running (3 milers and sprints).  

The knee is pretty sore in response, and I was wondering if anyone has haf a similar experience.  The graft was taken from the patellar tendon and I'm wondering if maybe I'm developing tendonitis even though it's only been about 2-3 weeks of actual running.

I should add that I am 21 so fairly young. </TEXT>
