	<TEXT> Goodbye my fellow brother. I've been waiting for a chance to write a fair well ode, so here is mine to you:

Do doth see the light beyond the grave, 

Do not give in to death or mourn of sadness,

There is a way out of this hell that your living.


The time has come, 

For you to take a journey.

To change your life,

And beyond to a new eternity.


We saaaayyyy goodbye to you forever,

But don't forget, we're always here beside you. 

Though you must go, do remember,

To love another person is to see the face of God.

	<TEXT> I take it your talking primarily about dopamine. And I think your right, if we're not getting dopamine and what have you from achievements and hobbies, we're gonna look at other places like PMO. 

Still, I think the reason that your not achieving things can generally fall under some category. Laziness can obviously prevent you from achieving things, as can stress or anxiety, for different reasons. Just my 2 cents, thanks for your input. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As many people know, PMO is just a coping mechanism for underlying problems in our lives. While dealing with PMO is important, addressing the underlying issues is far important, and should be our main goal. 

What I've been trying to do is found out what some of those underlying problems are. That's why I'm asking for input and experience from the NoFap community on this issue. 

So far I've isentified three causes of PMO: 

Boredom/Laziness 

Loneliness 

Stress/Anxiety 

Im sure there's more, so please give your input on this topic. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, obsessing over not watching porn is a mistake. It is far better to simply fill your time with good habits/practices/environments which will naturally draw you away from PMO. 

That said I disagree that watching porn a few times a week is not as bad as constantly thinking about not watching porn. For many, porn is an addiction that steals time/money/energy. It is far better for these people to avoid porn at all costs rather than give in a few times each week. Giving in will only make it harder to beat this addiction. The hope is that over time, these people will make better lifestyles changes so they will no longer need to obsess over not watching porn, </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really. NoFap is more than just abstaining from PMO. It's a lifestyle change replacing bad habits/practices with good ones. Instead of wasting time/money/energy on PMO, instead we focus on improving ourselves through physical training, productive hobbies, etc. and it's these things that give us "superpowers." 

PMO isn't the cause of the problem; it's a side effect, a coping mechanism for deeper problems. By abstaining from this coping mechanism (and others), we are forced to face the root issue and fix it, rather than run away. Given this, I think NoFap is far more than placebo. </TEXT>
