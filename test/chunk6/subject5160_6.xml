	<TEXT> Yea, its amazing to me that these guys never gave up their secrets, while American POWS from Vietnam like John McCain and several other high profile prisoners admitted to breaking and providing (often under torture) at least some information to their captors. It really shows that the CIA are really the top of the top. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Given that there are huge numbers of desterers mentioned in the text, it is all but assured that there are other veterans of the Band of the Hawk who were not killed in the eclipse, but given that they are not mentioned by name by Miura, they seemingly have no part in the story to play. It would also make sense that there were members who were to injured to continue serving as mercenaries and thus left the band of the hawk. </TEXT>

US Navy scientists are utilizing shark antibodies integrated into biosensor platforms which can determine whether military military personnel have been exposed to chemical or biological agents. Currently the military uses mammalian derived antibodies in similar systems, but it has been found that the shark derived antibodies are actually more resiliant to higher temperatures thus increasing the utilities of such biosensors </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wolfsmund is probably the closest thing to Berserk that has been completed, but Basilisk has alot of similar elements to it as well and has been finished.
Other manga series out there that are very similar to Berserk that have not been completed are Bastard! and Vinland Saga. Most of the other manga and anime people have mentioned here (excepting perhaps Claymore) don't have much in common with Berserk in my own opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was a  White Russian general during the Russian Civil War. For most of his life he was obsessed with East Asian culture. Mongolia had declared itself independent from China in 1911, but was subsequently reconquered by the Chinese. Under presssure from the Red Army, Von Ungarn attacked the Chinese in Monglia and drove them out. He installed Bogd Khan as nominal ruler of an independent Mongolian state, but was largely in control of the place himself. He made fantasical plans to conquer all of East Asia, and married a Manchu princess to give himself legitimacy. However, the Soviets  put a damper on these plans and sponsered a Communist take over of the country. Von Unger launched a pre-emptive attack against Soviet and Far Eastern Republic forces preparing to invade Mongolia, but his offensive was repulsed. Vastly outnumbered, he retreated back to Mongolia. His troops however believed their cause was lost and requested that their army move east to link up with the remaining White Russian forces in the Russian Far East. Von-Ungern however gave orders that they were to move to then independent Tuva and eventually make their way to Tibet, who's ruler (the Dali Lama) Von Ungarn had been in contact with. This caused his troops to revolt against him, and they assasinated his second and command and tried to kill him as well. Deserted by all but a few die hards, Von Ungern was soon captured by Soviet partisans and executed by the Soviet government. The partisan leader who captured him later died under mysterious circumstances in 1927. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Christianity was a rapidly growing religion in Japan up until the [Shimbara Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimabara_Rebellion) in 1637 in which tens of thousands of Christian peasants revoltated against the Shogunate. After the rebellion was put down, the Shogunate doubled down on its efforts to exterminate Christianity in Japan, expelling the Portuguese missionaries and traders which had moved into parts of the country and exterminating the christian communities they had formed. [Some Christians went underground, and practiced their religion in secret passing it down generation by generation until the anti-christian laws were repealed in 1873.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakure_Kirishitan) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is whats called a small portrait note, as small portrait notes are currently being destroyed by the Federal Reserve as they recieve them, they are increasing in value. However, very high grade uncirculated notes are the ones that have signifigant premiums to them. The note you have looks like it would grade somewhere between Extra Fine and About Uncirculated. I've seen 1988 $100 About Uncirculated grade notes sell on ebay for $120 shipped, which means that after selling fees and shipping costs you would make about $5 if you managed to sell it. The risk of loss and fraud alone means that its not really worth your time to try to sell it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in the early 2000's there was a great deal of speculation that North Korea had the capability of putting containerized ballistic missile systems onto merchant vessels, and use them for counter attacks against the mainland United States in the event of American intervention in North Korea. I haven't seen anything on this recently and was wondering if there had been any further developments regarding this theory or if it had ever been proven as having been implemented by North Korea or any other state. I imagine Iran, Egypt, and several other countries could potentially develop the same thing. I know the Russians attempted to market the Club-K containerized missile system that operates on the same principle, but has anyone country purchased it? </TEXT>
