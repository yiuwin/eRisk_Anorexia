	<TEXT> Since the ability to get Pokmon seen in your Pokdex when you see them in a gym, I've been regularly browsing through any gyms on my map just to see what's in them.

But since the recent update, this occasionally freezes and then the game closes. This has only happened to me when I was scrolling through the Pokmon quickly and (possibly a coincidence) Dragonite always happened to be at the top.

EDIT: I'm also on Android. Samsung Galaxy S7 if that helps.

EDIT: I'm referring to VIEWING the gym. Not battling it.

EDIT: It seems likely that this is caused by the gym having trainers with new clothing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with everything except the CP. Come on, you can't just add CP. That would break the game. You can't set a cap either. Pokmon have specific CP for a reason. You want to train your Ninetales, but Every single person training their Blissey to 3000CP will be gamebreaking.

Or what if Shuckle could leave behind it's lowly 300 CP and grow to 3000 CP? With the highest defense in the game, this might be even worse than Blissey. Every attack from a lower Pokmon might do 1 damage. 

I totally agree with the idea, but I think that we should get Stardust from this. Maybe a fake battle gains you 25 Stardust or something. (You can literally do this every minute so you can't get more Stardust than catching a Pokmon or something.)

Or maybe every 10 battles gives you an item. That way rural players won't be as stuck if there's nothing around them. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After catching almost 4500 Pokmon (according to my Collector medal) I'm pretty tired of seeing the same background every time I enter a capture. I think it's amazing that the background changes at night and they've even put in new music etc.

But I'd really love to see a Bellsprout in the grass, a Totodile near the water, A Larvitar in a rocky area, etc.

I know this has been mentioned before, but I haven't seen any mention of it in a while.

Also, I totally understand that this might be extra resources, etc but I'd personally be willing to let the game take up extra space or even occasionally use a tiny bit more data for this.

For those areas that are combinations of multiple biomes, the background could be a randomized choice of one of those biome backgrounds OR I'm sure the specific Pokmon that spawns will determine what biome pool it's pulling from and that specific biome could be the background.

What do you guys think? I'd really like this to be in the next update. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ... Okay but that's pretty much how the game works. You're basically complaining about the fact that not all the rare or difficult-to-get Pokmon are good. Many Pokmon aren't the strongest. They're just meant to be caught. Maybe it's someone else's favourite, though. :)

Remember that everyone has completely different spawns around them. I never saw a Porygon or Chansey until the Valentine's Day event, but I literally caught about 500 Clefairy. But some people really wanted Clefairy and were overjoyed to see them during the event.
I avoided Clefairy the whole event, but I understood that other people never had an easy chance to get them before.

In the same way, maybe Pinsir isn't the best Pokmon but maybe lots of people never see them and you do. It's not really rare for me either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, this has been mentioned many times on this subreddit, but for your sake, I'll briefly explain:

Eggs don't hatch randomly into Pokmon.

The Pokmon inside the egg is determined the instant you pick it up. We have no idea from our side because it is hidden from us but it's definitely saved on our accounts straight away.

An egg you picked up BEFORE Gen 2 was released will ALWAYS hatch into a Gen 1 Pokmon because it was already determined when you got it.

An egg you pick up now can hatch into any available Pokmon within that distance egg group. It now won't only be Gen 2 or Gen 1. It could be either.

Makes sense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'd like to discuss this a bit.

Firstly, the regional-exclusives for Gen 1 were 4 non-evolving Pokmon that are not game-changing.

In Gen 2, I believe the possible options will be:

Yanma, Girafarig, Dunsparce, Qwilfish, Shuckle, Corsola, Mantine, Stantler.

* I would not include Heracross as it will likely be a decent gym-battler and will be wanted by all.

* I would not include Miltank because it will likely be a Chansey-like or Snorlax-like equivalent with regards to defense and HP.

* I would not include Smeargle due to its uniqueness with its exclusive attack, Sketch.

* I would not include Sudowoodo because it is something of a unique Gen 2 mascot that was actually shown on the overworld in the game, similar to how Snorlax was for Gen 1.

* I would not include Delibird because Ice Pokmon are already very rare and it wouldn't be fair to make that easier for one area.

* Finally, I would hope that the previous Gen 1 regional-exclusives were set in specific areas for the purpose of making the next round work for completely different areas.

-----

So, despite these probably being mentioned before, here's my thoughts:

* Girafarig in Southern Africa - Giraffes are native to Africa.

* Dunsparce in Northern Africa because it is a cave/desert dwelling Pokmon and this seems to make me think of Egypt as a possibility.

* Qwilfish in some non-Farfetch'd Asia. Pufferfish are a delicacy in some Asian areas and Farfetch'd was clearly placed in specific areas of Asia for some reason.

* Yanma in South America. South America is known for rainforests and massive insects. I think this works well. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [PSA] My favourite thing about the new update is that it doesn't end your encounter during a network error! (x-posted from r/TheSilphRoad) </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The amount of times I lost a Pokmon because of a network error really frustrated me in previous versions. I lost my first Charizard and my first Hitmonchan because of these errors and while it took me forever to find another Hitmonchan, I never found another Charizard and ended up evolving one :)

Anyway, I usually have patches of bad reception in my area and with the new APK, it doesn't end your encounter with "Error" or freeze while the Pokmon "flees" even though you might have caught it.

It will now still tell you that you have an error, but it will try to reconnect while remaining in your encounter. It seemed a bit buggy, but I caught a Chansey because of it, even with my crappy connection, so yay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I went outside and got 5 Clefairys in my neighborhood in 5 minutes

Haha wow! I also see them fairly often in my area so I'm not too interested in them. Chansey and Smoochum, I need though.

I never saw a single Slowpoke until the last couple months and then I caught a Slowpoke and a Slowbro :O

Then I've seen maybe one or two since then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still need to find and catch:

* Chansey

* Porygon

I still need to hatch:

* Magby

* Elekid

* Smoochum

I still need to obtain via evolving:

* Magneton

* Dewgong

* Cloyster

* Electrode

* Gyarados

* Omastar

* Kabutops

And I'll never get any of the regionals at this point.

On the plus side, this event should hopefully give me Chansey and Smoochum. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, I don't mean it's impossible.

I just mean it seems a bit dumb for me to receive a Level 40 Charizard with Wing Attack and Fire Blast... and that's all :/

A level 12 *Pidgey* would even have 4 moves (I think).

Something I always made every effort to do was to get the most varied four moves on each of my Pokmon (in the original games) so if it means you have to go out of your way to get back moves or something, it seems like a bit of a mission :(

Just my opinion though. The fact that it's available at all is totally awesome. You can get all the unavailable Pokmon in your game this way and you don't even need anyone to trade with etc. I guess if the Pokmon you're receiving is unavailable in another way, then it's worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This doesn't make sense to me as Pokmon in PoGo have two moves.

Would they get two random moves upon transferring to your DS game? Or are you stuck with less moves until you learn new ones?

EDIT: I'm not saying it's impossible to work with this, I just think it's a bit sad that they'll only have two moves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When Billy-Boy becomes a man,

He leaves his home for a caravan.

His mum and dad do not approve

But oh how Billy wants to move!

He picks a house. Blue or red?

Both have hookers. One is dead.

He does not like the hobo's hugs.

He does not like the smell of drugs.

He goes outside to fight the cats

Because he has to now eat rats.

The neighbour lady makes him run

And laughs as she waves her gun.

Billy slowly starts to learn the truth...

as he loses hair and tooth...

"The redneck life is not for me!"

Billy yells, proudly as can be. </TEXT>
