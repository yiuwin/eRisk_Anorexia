	<TEXT> While I think it's a positive experience overall and has a pretty impressive plot twist, I have to say that I find it unrealistic and like it answered one question but left out a thousand others. To put it bluntly I don't see how it's "one of the best scifi movies" material which it is according to a lot of people.

About the realism: I'd imagine that if this was real, you'd think the government would get more than just one linguist and one scientist (I don't even remember what's his specialization) to find out about, well, everything. From what the movie shows us, it's safe to assume that the heptapods have way, way, way advanced technology than we do. So much that when I see the aliens and the shells, they don't feel alienlike, more of Godlike. First, the shells - enormous, perfectly shaped, solid colored, nicely rocky textured, levitating without leaving any clues of "how", presumably indestructable, also able to vanish into thin air (maybe time manipulation but that's equally Godlike). The heptapods - They squirt ink that "magically" fly towards the glass and form the exact patterns they want. I mean, yeah we use ink as well, but it's not like we splash ink on a surface and somehow make it form alphabets. Yet it can be presumed that they are not Gods, since they don't show any form of putting themselves above humans and they need our help after all. So basically they don't feel like aliens to me, not to say that I know what aliens are like if they exist.

The plot: Personally I find it intriguing when they first met the heptapods and tried to communicate but I won't blame those who find the movie sleep-inducing. Quite a weak opening sequence too. What put me off the most was that I was really getting excited for the slow and steady learning of the alien language and then they basically did a fast forward and poof it's like they learned the alien language completely, they can even put the alien symbols on a computer program and it can translate everything perfectly. That felt like r/restofthefuckingowl material to me. Also, for a story where super advanced aliens come to Earth on a global scale, it's pretty silly that the plot ends up focusing on a single person's life. While it did imply that the alien language is a big discovery and useful tool for all of humanity, the movie ends ends right after Louise understands what's going on, so as far as the movie is concerned, she is the primary focus as opposed to the aliens or their language. And judging by her "memories" it seems like life goes on as normal after the aliens left anyway. So I guess we have to wait 3000 years to have any idea what's the whole purpose and reason of this alien visit. Now that I think of it, it's like how Jesus came down to Earth then rose back to Heaven and we'll just have to spread the gospel until the second coming lol. Again, feels Godlike rather than alienlike.

Lastly, I just feel this film lacks a lot of technicality. I mean, it's supposed to be scifi right? Or does it mean it's a drama after all; the scifi is just a disguise to make the plot twist better? The plot twist definitely worked out beautifully, though IMO it would be better if they answered more questions after that. There's really nothing more to the plot the moment you figure out the nonlinear-time-memories thing. It was interesting while Louise was explaining and applying her expertise on the technicalities and science of language and using a scientific approach to communicate with the heptapods. Then it turned into a let's-help-each-other wholesome philosophy thing. It's a nice emotional touch, but would you blame me for being disappointed when I was all built up for a clever, geeky story? Actually, I'm not saying that there's no cleverness in the story, but the movie doesn't confirm any of it; it's all viewer's speculations, no matter how probable, and the writer's just like "for me to know and for you to find out.. except there's no way for you to unless I explicitly tell you because it's fiction and I'm the writer".

I find my feel towards this movie a lot like towards The Imitation Game. Was intriguing at first, expecting to understand the genius behind his cracking of the enigma machine and foundation of artificial intelligence, but it ends up being more of a drama about his personal life, not that I don't appreciate it. Still a great movie nonetheless but a lot of wasted potential if I say so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reddit orders 10 beers and drinks at imgur's table. Imgur claims 5 of them as his own while getting annoyed at Reddit for occupying his table. While they argue, 9Gag passes by and goes to order the same beer as Reddit. Somehow Reddit manages to notice that in the middle of an argument and gets mad, accusing 9Gag of stealing all of his beers. 

A few moments later, Imgur concludes that he can't win and so bitterly shares his table with Reddit. 9Gag is happily enjoying his beer elsewhere. Reddit remains hostile towards the two for the rest of the night. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to understand that we are approaching the matter of "going to hell" as objectively as we can. If a person does not accept Christ, that person will not be able to enter heaven, period. It's not about what you do or how you live your life determining your worthiness of going to heaven. *Nobody* is worthy of heaven, not even the "holiest" of Christians, without Christ. It's basically a yes/no system regarding the acceptance of Christ as your Lord.

It's not a personal attack. I know, hearing someone telling you that you'll "go to hell" is a very unpleasant thing to hear, but try not to take it too personally. Yes, there are a lot of "holier than thou" type of Christians around who say it really to condemn you using words but I really hope you understand that there are also us who use it objectively as I've explained above. It makes things so much difficult if everyone gets touchy around the subject of the salvation in Christianity. </TEXT>
