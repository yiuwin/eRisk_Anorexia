	<TITLE> 'And then we doubled it': Thoughts on Incentives, Resting, and Primal Gear </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-01 22:53:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I originally had the gist of this post as a comment in an earlier /r/Diablo thread about the new Primal items, but it got quickly buried and I had a few more thoughts on the topic since then that I wanted to bounce off of this community for feedback.

It's always been fascinating to me how a reward can, from another perspective, simply be the absence of penalty. Long-time Blizzard fans were introduced to this concept several years ago when World of Warcraft introduced the "rest" mechanic. The idea was to get players to only game for a couple of hours at a time, rather than go for 26-hour binges before dying of dehydration. The idea was that over time while in-game grinding, the character would tire out, reducing the amount of XP they could farm per monster kill. Beta testers absolutely hated feeling like they were being punished for playing longer than the devs wanted, so instead they introduced "rest areas" wherein if you logged out for a while in these zones, you would restart the game with a 200% XP bonus. This went over far better with the testers, but interestingly the devs didn't actually change any numbers, they just doubled everything, making the "penalty" XP loss the new "normal", and the old "normal" into a nice bonus.

Diablo 3's variant of this idea is the Reflecting Pools. You can find these wells so easily in-game, and the 25% XP boost lasts for so long that it can start to feel like the baseline rather than a bonus. It just keeps stacking and stacking, forever giving you a helpful XP bonus... until you die. Then you lose all any Reflecting Pool bonus you had and go back to normal. See what they did there? Much like in Diablo 2 they still reduced your XP as a penalty for dying, but it doesn't "feel" like a punishment so much as a temporary setback.

Marketers love this trick because people tend to respond to positive incentives better than negative ones. Selling cars for half price is OK, but selling them under a "buy-one-get-one-free" model gets you a lot more business as people believe they're getting a steal of an offer! Hotel chains hosting large conferences often rephrase "late booking fees" as "early booking discounts". And, of course, long-time players who have been conditioned to years of free content updates will complain when they have to buy DLC for the first time ;)

Which brings us to Ancient and Primal gear. A bonus you receive all the time stops feeling like a bonus. It's just the new normal, and anything less than that is a penalty by another name. When the mechanic was originally introduced, Ancient gear was meant to actually "feel" like a bonus: they were (in theory) rare enough to not fully deck out your character with 13 BiS pieces, but powerful enough to offer that bump that makes a difference on the leaderboards. But it later turned out that it wasn't quite so implausible for regular people to grind out a fully Ancient-equipped character before the season ended, so full-Ancient became mundane. The LoN re-design was Blizzard's way of admitting that Ancients were too common to work as intended, so now we get Primal Ancients to scratch that rare item itch. The whole point is to *not* be fully decked in Primal stuff, but to maybe find 1 or 2 items that offer a bonus that feels more rewarding than just scraping your way back up to "average".

All this is to say that, whatever else can be said about Blizzard, they aren't stupid. This isn't a simple case of power creep, it's just an update on a long-standing psychological reward system that Diablo has always been based on. I don't know if it will be a game-changer in practice, but when patch 2.5.0 drops and I get that first Primal, it won't cheapen my old nonseasonal Ancient gear because I know it's an extraordinary event rarely duplicated. It won't add to my grind time and it sure as hell won't make me want to reforge my Ancient Wand of Woh.

Thoughts?

Edit for TL;DR - TED talk about the psychology of reward, followed by a defense of Primal gear. Basically, hard to find items are a bonus, not a baseline. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't say inventory space. I was talking about my Hero slots, of which there are 12, or 15 if you got the special edition.

	<TEXT> I'm reminded of Pools of Reflection, those wells that give you 25% EXP. They're so common and last for so long that you basically have them all the time, but when you die it gets reset. A bonus you get all the time ceases to be a bonus, it just becomes the new baseline, so being deprived of that "bonus" is the game's way of penalizing you by reducing you to "normal". 

Blizzard is no stranger to this; veteran WoW players will remember when the rest mechanic was introduced, they phrased it as an experience penalty for ending the game outside of a rest area. People hated that, so without changing the numbers or the mechanic, the devs simply re-phrased it as a bonus (for quitting inside a rest area) and the testers were thrilled with it.

(Sidenote: If anybody has gotten used to years of free content, then complained when the paid Necromancer DLC was announced, that's why. /sidenote)

The way I see it, Primal Ancient items are just Blizzard's way of modernizing what regular Ancient items were originally supposed to be: a bonus, not the baseline. They're just rare enough that you can't expect to be fully decked out, and just enough of a bonus to make that crucial difference on the leaderboards. I don't know how it will work out in practice, but to me it's just another facet that's great to have but not necessary except at the highest tiers of play. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once you're up to 70, some would joke that the game can actually begin :P A lot of legendary and set items become available and can begin to drop, each contributing to a different mechanic or skill set. The point is that just because you're both barbs doesn't mean you can't both be drastically different builds anyway. If you want to shake it up and find a new playstyle completely, a typically ranged class like Demon Hunter could be fun, or a Witch Doctor if you want to try letting your pets do the grunt work. Wizards do a lot of damage but can be squishy at lower levels (though that isn't really a problem at lower difficulties anyway), and Crusaders and Monks are two variations of tanky (high armor vs. high dodge chance). Each class has several different variants you can run, of course. You have options at lower levels, but in general as long as you prioritize damage you won't have a problem getting up to 70 quickly. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for ideas to refine the mechanics of a magic item </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-26 04:03:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I made a 5e one-shot a while back, and one player wanted to make a Captain America type of Paladin that threw her shield over and over. It was a lighthearted game we weren't taking seriously, so with no magical throwing shield in the DMG, I made my own mechanics and may have gotten a little carried away...

The shield, Falkonbord, has the returning property, but if she threw it with an enemy in melee range, they would get an op attack and her AC could not include the shield's +2 while in flight. Falkonbord has a thrown range of 20/60; it can't travel a total distance farther than its max range, nor can it bank or curve in mid-air. It could only change direction by bouncing off something, meaning no enemy could be hit more than once unless she bounced it off another surface first.

The idea was that she would call her shot, pointing out every enemy in Falkonbord's flight path. The first enemy struck would be a standard Str vs. AC attack, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage. From there (assuming the first strike was a hit), a Dex check was made against a DC determined by how many enemies she called out. If she passed the check, everything she hit would take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This effectively meant that a 6th level player was doing 3, 4, or even 5d6 of damage per round as a cantrip, though the damage was spread around and ineffective against single targets like bosses.

From her perspective it was a risk vs. reward kind of thing; do I risk a higher DC (it incremented by 4 each time) to hit more bad guys? It's a fun mechanic but I thought it could use some refinement, so I share it with this community for advice and suggestions. Thanks :) </TEXT>

What I worry about is that as I get older, the same thing will happen to me: I will have spent my youth fighting for rights that are here now, but when I get old the next generation will discover new inequalities we hadn't even considered and I will start to resist change on the basis that these new unheard of issues are too "frivolous" to be worth fighting for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not caring and not giving a fuck are two very different things. People who don't care are boring, and say things like "That movie tries too hard" or just "Pffff..." or simply don't comment at all.

People who don't give a fuck go out of their way to make sure you know it. Oftentimes they care too much, but the thing they care about is making it abundantly clear how little they give a fuck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In many places in America, the mother isn't entirely in control of how many kids she ends up with, on account of *another* irritatingly self-righteous conservative talking point, but that's a whole other can of worms. Suffice it to say it's not your job to presume how they ended up there.

Truth be told, I wish more than anything else that welfare wasn't absolutely necessary for society to work properly, but that's not the world we have. I've scraped a modestly comfortable life together through no small amount of sheer dumb luck, but when you're as poor as I was growing up, middle-class people *are* the rich; in our minds they got lucky or born into it. Actual rich people are a fairy tale. Welfare sucks, but I'm truly jealous of the clearly charmed lives of the people who think we don't need it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's more to the poverty dynamic than just that. For kids growing up in the poorest conditions, welfare is simply the only life they've ever known. Being poor is expensive, and while getting out requires sacrifice, poor people simply don't have anything *to* sacrifice. If you think it's hard to get a stoner off the couch long enough to find a job at McDonald's, try convincing a single mother of three to give up one of her jobs to take on classes or an unpaid internship. Every resource, including the WIC card, goes into merely maintaining the shitty life in progress, keeping your head above water while holding a bag of cement that only gets heavier the more you try to get rid of it. That's the welfare trap. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I trust the raw data, but I stand by the original point that what constitutes a celebrity has a lot to do with exposure, and the information age has cooked the numbers. BBC must have a lot more pre-prepared obituaries than ever before, frequently being revised and updated. Instant media means that every news source wants to be the "first" to get the scoop on an event like that, so it's safe to assume other news outlets have pre-written articles as well. It's a journalistic arms race. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gearing the followers is a bit unintuitive. The damage they deal is so small that offense becomes insignificant, but toughness is irrelevant once you find the token that makes them immortal (indispensable if you play solo). You want to focus on items that affect their skills and support you, as if you were playing a zDPS character. If you absolutely must have a gem in the sword, they're all pretty bad options but I suppose an argument can be made for Topaz thorns damage, as he's going to get hit a lot. Mostly I'd just roll the socket off and get something like CDR for him. </TEXT>

Better than MP3's for sure, but the difference is barely detectable to untrained ears.
