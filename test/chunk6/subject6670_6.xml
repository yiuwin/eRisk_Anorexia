	<TITLE> Help with xbox app (win 10) and xbox smartglass (ios). Can't turn on console (can recognize its is 'sleeping") </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-18 05:42:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey.  I have my xbox one wired into my asus rt68u router.  I have a iphone 6 with smartglass and surface pro 4 with xbox app.  BOTH can see my xbox is there.  Both can control the xbox IF IT IS ALREADY turned on (i can even game stream on the surface).  However, neither can 'wake it' from sleep.   i.e.  I cannot turn it on (its in instant on mode)   I've 'forgot device' from both apps and re added, i've also rebooted my router and hard rebooted my xbox, still no go.  any help is appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i had an issue, and online chat passed me over to microsoft store chat so that they wouldn't get a negative review.   The ENGLISH speaking person via chat told me to call, the call center can do more than the chat, and the store chat was getting this all the time, and it was becoming frustrating to them.   Calling is the way to go, as they helped me RIGHT first try! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Surface Pro 4 and Hearthstone. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-24 02:22:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Well, i just got my m3 surface pro 3 (i had a surface pro 2) and am loving it.  I have always heard about Hearthstone but never tried.  After getting the surface pro 4 i was looking at what games work well with touch.  Seems unanimus that Hearthstone was one of the best (I love civ already).  I installed it and, fell in love.
Problem is, it keeps freezing my system.  I've tried some different resolutions (none fills the screen sadly) but it will always freeze.  Its at random play amounts also.  Sometimes it'll be during my first match...other times during my 10, but it will always happen.  
My surface is FULLY updated, and no other programs are running.  (i'm actually running the newest intel driver w/ control pannel)

Any help or thoughts (esp optimum resolution/settings) would be very appreciated! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Got the demo unit (last pro 3) that my local staples has. its was 299 and the coupon for 50$ off clearance tablet applied.   The pen was missing, so the manager gave me the surface pro 4 pen (with tips) for 1/2 off (30$)  Here's my problem.  It has a slight yellow tint line down the left side.   Really, it doesn't bother me to bad, but i know its a hardware defect.  Microsoft knows by there serial its a demo unit, and will not warranty it.   I have a surface pro 2 i5 128gb thats perfect.  Was planning on selling it (i think i might be able to actually make a little money - or at least break even) but now i'm not sure which to keep.  I still have warranty on the pro 2 until july 2016.   Whats Reddits opinion?
Thanks! </TEXT>
