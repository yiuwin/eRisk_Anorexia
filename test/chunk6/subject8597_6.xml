	<TEXT> In universe, Tony will win the Presidency, and have very little time for super-stuff. He'll pop up when plot demands it. 

Marvel woould be foolish to kill RDJ's Stark, and I don't think the man has any real interest in walking away from the biggest thing he's ever done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone once told me that they were releasing a set of Masterpiece Seekers with all the old hip kibble from OG MP Starscream. I immediately started fingering their anus and nibbling on their earlobe, whispering for more information.
The Mustache Master at the leather bar I was hanging out at overheard the whole talk and knew this bastard was fucking with me. He only clued me in only after he saw me let the bastard give me a full facial, stumbling around on a mechanical bull. I felt so stupid.

Where were you then? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some prick injected me with some synthetic Chinese neurotoxin, and unless I accrue massive levels of downvotes, I'm fucked.

So, here's my honest opinion on MP-33.
Fuck. That. Thing.
In the history of Optimus Primes, Primal is without question, the least visually appealing of the bunch. 
While this figure is truly amazing in is faithfulness to its source (and should probably have its dick sucked really hard for it), it's not GEE WUN...
There is no place for this on my Masterpiece shelf. There is no place for this on any of my shelves, because Beast Wars was like stale, off brand Captain Crunch... shitty enough to make me hate my mom.
I don't know how any of you guys are going to present this thing, but I promise you one thing. It's gonna look like miserable dick, overshadowed by the ginger pubes that are your Beast Wars collections.

	<TEXT> Kanye never had a TG16. He overheard some rich honkey kids talking about their dads old consoles and jumped on the first thing he heard that might make his next album sound relevant to his music purchasing, and ticket buying audience (the lily-white ones, with money for 90 dollar tee-shirts). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Born in Kansas, blessedly into a military family. I got to see the northern hemisphere in great detail before my Paw retired  and brought us all back here.

This state is every bit as contemporary in attitudes and ideals as the festering piles of shit directly to the north and south, which in turn are equally as abysmal as their southern and northern neighbors.

Granted, I am happier in a place like Wichita than I am in Salina, compared to a city like Phoenix or Raleigh, I might as well be living in Gypsum.

Doing my best to end this rant without pissing all over the states politics, but they are a big part of the problem.

In all, I think the nation would only thrive if someone were to take a five hundred mile wide plow, and raze everything from the North Dakota/Canada border to Laredo. Start over.

Life inside a filthy Norman Rockwell painting is not life at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A whole new series actually.

Animated.

No timeline, just more episodes, tastefully written, animated by the guys who do Archer, and dubbed by original cast when possible.

Call it a late night animated show for TV Land.

Cable execs, this is a pitch. PM me for more details. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because they are a one size fits all type of garment, and fit smaller heads better when pulled tight across the lower jaw. On bigger heads, much of the mask covers the nose and mouth with less to go down below. 

It wasn't a "regulation" thing as far as I know.
Probably not a gender thing either.
More comfort and personal preference. 

That's just how they fit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What if Jesus was nothing more than a slave to his hyper-advanced penis... a mindless drone, operated with miraculous precision by the brain below the belt? 

What if water made Jesus melt, and his penis used telepathy to levitate Jesus above wet surfaces? What if the penis of Jesus was a master of hydrodynamics and used it's deep knowledge to manipulate the feet of Jesus to repel fluids?

What if Jesus had been nailed to the cross by his all knowing penis? Would Jesus' penis have still been able to resurrect him had it been skewered instead of his ankles and wrists?

Was Jesus Christ's ever-knowing, and mega-empowered penis the trick behind the resurrection?

	<TEXT> Well, to argue for the pricks that demanded rolling heads: Giger did spent an awful lot of time airbrushing mosaics of dicks, pussies, dicks and pussies, and pussy garbage chutes. I might be shocked if I were a kid stumbling onto these images upon recommendation from a teacher.

But, how many times have they canned a teacher for name-dropping Georgia O'Keeffe?

At least Gigers shit looks cool.
