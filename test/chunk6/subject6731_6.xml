	<TEXT> I gave it two shots a few years ago. No way I'm going to go to any effort to give it a third. Got far, far too many other, better tryptamines to trip. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would love to see this for a much larger body of texts; I would also like to see proper definitions given. I am honestly flabbergasted to see that War and Peace has such a large number of unique words, but then again I've never read it. Could it be because the copy you used maintains the original's use of Russian (or English, in translation) for narration and French (even in the English) for conversation? If so then that kinda dampens the effect of your graph.

	<TEXT> You got a different MET than me. Mine was dark brown, almost dirt-colored. Packaged differently too. Wonder if there is a molecular difference between my MET and yours? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What color was the MET you got? Mine was a deep brown. Another person, a rather old man, has reported to me having experienced similar effects.

Any experience with EPT? Only done it once and I tend to tell people that, while MET feels erotic like meth, DPT feels intensely hallucinogenic like 12g mushrooms, EPT tends to feel more sedating and numbing, with an almost opiate-like flavor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really didn't mind the taste. I've vaped it maybe 5 times and snorted twice or thrice. I usually have some sort of erotic reaction thereto, but only once to that level. The burn is what gets to me: it doesn't hurt at all for the first 30 seconds or so but slowly waxes until becoming almost unbearable, then wanes; all in all, lasting for about ten minutes and ending roughly as the peak starts. 

I don't really know what nicotine feels like, for tobacco is not a drug I am willing to touch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't remember feeling anything good from 5-MeO-MiPT. Just made me feel gross inside and out, so sweaty, and I distinctly recall my olfactory sense being heightened significantly, to no good effect. </TEXT>
