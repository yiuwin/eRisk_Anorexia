	<TEXT> Indeed. I'm a child of the 90's and people always accuse me that I had no childhood. Usually because I didn't watch the 90's cartoons, just MASH and Star Trek. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm afraid your scale is a bit off. Take a look at this website. It demonstrates scale if the moon were the size of one pixel on your screen. Scroll through it a little bit and it can help you comprehend the scale!

Edit: Not as an alternate title, but just as a title for something else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None yet. I want to read through the main comics first. I only discovered Mignola last year, so I haven't had much time XD

Actually I discovered comics in general last year. So I've been frantically reading what people generally consider the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently I have been making some small simulation/art/time-waster projects and I would like to share them with people. They're not quite games, but there is some minor interaction.

Does anybody know a good place for me to share them? Any good websites out there for stuff like this? Or should I try and make my own website for posting projects? </TEXT>
