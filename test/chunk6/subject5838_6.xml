	<TEXT> First off, [fixed the link for you](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheCraftyLamm).  Secondly, your pictures are wonderful.  Third, I would recommend doing trades and/or selling at a discount in order to rack up your first few sales.  You need to build your feedback and credibility.  Yes, you know you are an honest seller, but new customers need to hear about the experiences of other customers.  Your prices *may* seem high to customers because it's a brand-spankin-new shop.  Once you have a few sales under your belt, your pricing is exactly where it should be.  Hope that helps!  I currently run 4 separate Etsy shops and it does take a bit more of a push at the beginning to start the momentum.  Best of luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's an [exchange](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2013/) that takes place every year in December where redditors can be signed up to be a "secret santa" to another redditor.  The person you send to is not the person who will send to you, so sometimes people get the shaft.  Sometimes people don't even get matched up!  Last year, I signed up as a rematcher x3 (sending to those who never rec'd) on two different accounts.  I didn't even have my original santa match up, so I ended up sending out *seven* santa gifts and getting zero in return.  It sucked.  I didn't expect seven back for my efforts, but one would have been nice.  At the time, I signed up to be so many rematches because I figured I could just send stuff from my shop.  I ended up going WAY overboard, digging into everyone's interests and pseudo-stalking to make the best, customized presents possible.  During rush season, among 1000s of other, profitable orders of my own to deal with.  Would not recommend.  Anyway, I felt super let down by not getting matched up, and don't want others to feel like that!  Needless to say, I didn't sign up for 2013.  Sending out decals is like an easier version of a rematch! :)

TL;DR Got dicked over by Secret Santa 2012, fixing it in my own way. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Monthly Meetup for December </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-21 14:47:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Due to our freakishly late Thanksgiving this year, Dec 1 interferes with a lot of our lovely redditoras going to a lot of lovely places.  Therefore, the date has changed for the clothing exchange to **December 8th**.

Date: Sunday, December 8th.

Time: 11:00am--???

Location: [Kalimera Caf](http://www.kalimeracafe.com/) at 15311 E. Alameda Parkway in Aurora. (Intersection of Chambers   Alameda) [Yelp Reviews](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kalimera-cafe-aurora) for the curious.

What to Bring: Any unwanted clothes, accessories, shoes, etc. that need to be cycled out of your rotation!  I would be happy to take any remaining clothes to be donated to Goodwill.

Please note: There were some concerns about size.  It looks like we're going to have ladies ranging all over, so c'mon down, bring whacha got and we'll see what's what.  Worst case scenario, you're at a brunch at a place with good service   great company.

	<TEXT> I do cross-post now and then, but it really conflicts what the sub was supposed to be about.  Organizing in general is a little difficult, as many people (not just r/denverwomen) are flaky.  I should just make a generic post saying "If you want to hangout and/or need new friends in the city, text me at any given time" and just leave it at that. ;) </TEXT>

I've used one by TreSemme, Fructis, Herbal Essences...they're all essentially the same.  My hair has turned from being a giant pain to being easy to style.  Takes maybe 5 minutes to comb, scrunch through with serum stuff (top layer) and then blow dry bangs/a little bit in the back.  It's glorious! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Clothing exchange: Dates? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-14 20:01:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all, I've discussed with a few of you at one time or another the possibility of doing another clothing exchange.  We had a great turnout at the last one, and I ended up with a metric shit-ton of new clothes that I still wear a *lot*.  It doesn't require a lot of participants; I know I brought a bagfull of clothes that I needed to cycle out.  Yeah, we're not all the same sizes.  I think I ended up with a few things from a girl like 7" shorter than me, but not everything fits everyone the same if you're going for a different look.  So take a chance, saddle up, get some brunch with me and whoever else comes.  Right now I'm taking suggestions for proposed dates.  I would like to do this IN PLACE OF the meetup for the first Friday of the month.  I do intend to cross-post this to [r/denver](http://www.reddit.com/r/denver) unless there is any opposition, in which case we'll open it up to discussion.

Also, last time, which was very well executed, (brunch at Lodo's during the exchange, and a thrift store hunt afterwards) any unwanted clothes were taken to Goodwill immediately after the event.  I would be happy to take on this responsibility.

Included: Clothing, Accessories, Shoes, etc... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there, I am a long time Etsy seller that is always looking to expand.  If you've got a good, unique product that you can mass produce and are interested in selling wholesale, shoot me pricing (wholesale and ideal retail) and we'll see if we can work something out.

Right now, I have working relationships with a few Etsy vendors that I buy items in bulk from, anywhere from 10 to 100 at a time, depending on my external sales.  This should, in no way, interfere with your Etsy sales, rather, be an additional source of revenue for you.  Thanks for reading. </TEXT>

Why these are not on the top shelf is beyond me.  Maybe they want the sales associates to *have* to talk to customers, in order to get them down?  Hmph. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I don't think [u/hop_hound](http://www.reddit.com/user/hop_hound) has posted yet for this week, but the get together on Wednesday night is going to be at [Strange Brewing Co](http://www.strangebrewingco.com/).  Shindig starts at 6p, I usually show at 7 or 8.  I wanted to post here because it's been posted more than once in the past on here, and I wanted to reassure those of you that don't know that it's a good time, and there will be other womenfolk present.

PS- Costumes encouraged.  I will be sporting a scarecrow getup, so I should be easy to identify.  Also, my name is Mallory. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Interest in Moab for Thanksgiving week </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-29 15:03:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey, all!  The hubby and I were thinking of heading to Moab and/or as many of Utah's national parks that we can get to over part or all of Thanksgiving break.  We are both off from the 11/23 until 12/1.  As it's too cold to camp, I'm all for staying in hotels or booking something from [vrbo.com](http://www.vrbo.com), which was recommended to me by a friend.  We were curious as to if anyone (or couple, this isn't necessarily women only, obviously) would be interested in joining us.  Note, I am not, nor do I plan to, post to [r/denver](http://www.reddit.com/r/denver).  I feel that this sub is a little more private.  I will be at the [meetup this Friday](http://www.reddit.com/r/denverwomen/comments/1ol3ze/monthly_meetup_friday_november_1st/) (I'll post a reminder, too, don't worry) if you'd like to meet me beforehand.  Just thought I'd float out an invite to see if anyone likes the national parks as much as I do!!!


Note:  We are planning on taking my car, so that's not a concern. :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Monthly Meetup: Friday, November 1st! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-16 19:52:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey ladies, last month I posted very last minute about a meetup on the first Friday of every month.  We ended up opening it up to r/Denver and had a few gentleman show up, and it ended up being a good time.  This time, I'd like to get the word out in advance this time and have it be lady-centric, at least in the beginning of the evening.

I'm basically planning the same meetup at the same place, with a new time and date. [OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/denverwomen/comments/1nq2vz/proposal_ladies_night_meetup_on_the_first_friday/)

Location: [El Jardn ](http://www.iloveeljardin.com/)up on 73rd and Route 2.  [Yelp Reviews](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jardin-commerce-city) for the curious.  Qualifications met: Good food, good drinks, and plenty of space.

Date: Friday, November 1st

Time: 6pm

Feel free to text me at 630.750.5033 for a specific spot in the restaurant once we're there.  Name's Mallory.

A little about me, for those who don't know me.  I'm a 25F who moved here last July (2012) from Chicago.  My interests are sports (playing, not watching), hiking, camping, crafting, marketing, teaching, also tend to be a girly girl with nails/clothes/etc even if my attempt at fashion is usually a fail.

Looking forward to meeting all you Denver noobs that keep posting as well as seeing new faces!!! Disclosure: I say "Denver noobs" affectionately. </TEXT>
