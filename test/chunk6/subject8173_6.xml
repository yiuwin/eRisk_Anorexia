	<TEXT> This was mine too! Even in elementary school when they did the whole what do you want to be when you grow up this, I'd always say a pro wrestler. I got laughed at mostly. Right when I turned 18 I went to wrestling school and trained for 2 years. I might not have achieved stardom or anything, but setting foot in an actual ring was beyond incredible. And debuting in a match in front of 1,100 people wasn't too shabby either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Wonder Years - Hoodie Weather

"Growing up means watching my heroes turn human in front of me. And the songs we wrote at eighteen seem short sighted and naive. So when the weather breaks I'll pull my hoodie up over my face. I won't run away, run away. **Cause as fucked as this place got, it made me me.**" 

Encapsulates everything I felt about leaving home.

Also, The Wonder Years - I Just Want To Sell Out My Funeral

Oh and Fireworks - The Hotbed of Life

"So, I started writing songs about this girl... And now that girl, she's somebodies wife."

Timing played a cruel joke on me when I first heard those lyrics. </TEXT>

The storyline will revert back to the idea that Cena is attempting to tie Ric Flairs record of 16 championships. </TEXT>
