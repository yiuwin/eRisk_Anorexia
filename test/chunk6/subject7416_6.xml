	<TEXT> True, but there is also such a thing as close platonic friendships, just because you care about someone deeply doesn't mean that you have romantic feelings towards them. Now I am not saying you can't interpret it as a romantic thing if you want to, but I do think that with that you're ruling out the idea of meaningful friendships, which is unfair imo. Obviously there has been homoerotic symbolism in Coen brothers films before, and that is not a bad thing... but I don't like it when people interpret all close same-sex friendship as sexual/romantic. 

So maybe he is bi, but I never got that from the movie, then again I might very well be wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recognising racist language is not the same thing as indulging in racism, he didn't associate black people with animals, he assumed someone else did, because racist people have a tendency to dehumanise people by talking about ethnic minorities as they are wild animals, insects, or diseases. 

Was OP being racist? I don't know, but your argument is definitely a defense of racism regardless, and if you don't understand why describing a group of black people as "disgusting animals" might be percieved as racist then you're either ignorant or hateful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly I don't think that girl calling out (the person she believed to be) Trump matters all that much, sure it is funny, but she is just a kid, she has no real opinions about politics other than what her parents have taught her.

Now I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing, and it is definitely not brainwashing or whatever some people would like to call it, I just think that is important to keep in mind that at that age kids are just parroting whatever they've heard other people say. That goes the other way too, because kids with Make America Great Again hats don't really know what any of it means either. So this whole thing is silly, it is not offensive or bad, it just not something we should take all that seriously in any capacity.  </TEXT>

And you're just being obtuse and childish, your line of reasoning is nothing more than reductive nonsense that solely exist to be difficult about things. I agree there are no specific rule, but I would say that you're not really vetegatarian unless you have gone several weeks without conciously eating any meat, and you have plans to avoid eating meat in the forseeable future. However if you know plan to eat meat once a month, then you're not vegetarian... you can call yourself flexitarian or mostly vegetarian, but you're not a true vegetarian.

Have I humoured you enough now?  </TEXT>

I really hate when movies or TV shows treat us like idiots by pandering to the lowest common denominator, by over explaining everything, and by not having the guts to go where it needs to go. There was nothing of that in Atlanta, Donald knew that even us white folks would be able to empathise with he characters and care about them even if he couldn't relate to all of their experiences.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mostly stuck to Chinese food, because I didn't feel the need to eat a lot of western food, but yeah most of it was pretty bad. The pizza was the worst though, it is like they fundamentally didn't understand what a pizza was supposed to taste like... I guess part of it was due to how they probably didn't use dairy cheese.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are other terms out there you know, if you eat dairy products but not meat for an instance, then you're a vegatarian like me. If you occasionally eat fish then you're a pescetarian, if you eat chicken then you're a pollotarian.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Criticising someone for inaccurately categorising something isn't gatekeeping OP, because some things are in fact binary. If you eat fish occasionally you aren't vegan, that is not gatekeeping, that is not a form of exclusion based on an idea of superiority, it just a fact. If you do heroin once a month you're not straight edge, you just don't do drugs very often, and if you have sex once in a while you're not celibate, you just don't get laid a lot.

	<TEXT>  Also do you know how much comics can end up costing a month 

One of the reasons I don't want to get into comics honestly, because I don't know if I can afford it, like I am already spending more money then I should on records. 

And I am not crazy about all the hostility and exclusionary attitudes that seems to run rampart in the nerd community  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly I understand that was their reasoning, but I don't know if casting a white lady was the best solution. Because obviously they couldn't rewrite that character as being Chinese, because that would be incredibly insensitive... but there is something really fucked up about Marvel sucking up to China. 

They could still have cast at least an Asian actor in the role, and just made the character less stereotypical.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah that was my takeaway from the whole election, that the reason why he was able to get away with all of the fucked up thing he said and did was because there was always a new controversy around the corner, to the point where he didn't get enough time to focus on story long enough for it to kill his chances of winning. And I guess it actually made running smear campaings against him useless because himself was in control of all the bad shit people had on him.
