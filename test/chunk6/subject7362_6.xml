	<TEXT> my impulse is to roll my eyes and brush them off as ignoramuses. usually i restrain myself, but it's not always possible, especially if it's in an informal or social setting, in which case i've occassionally been quite rude. it really is a terrible thing to say - it's almost like meeting someone from mississippi and telling them they're not as black as you thought they'd be.

I travel a lot to the mainland and i get this question all the time. it drives me crazy. but context means a lot. if the first thing someone says when i meet them is about my (lack of) accent then basically i want to end the conversation right away. if, on the other hand, someone genuinely is curious about newfoundland and its dialects i am happy to tell them all i know, especially if they are interested to learn something that goes against their preconceived notion of what a newfoundlander sounds like. newfoundland english is actually pretty interesting, but someone who leads with their ignorance of it in small talk usually isn't worth talking to.

and if i'm feeling generous i'll explain that it's not that i don't sound like a newfoundlander, but rather that i don't sound like what they think a newfoundlander sounds like. and then i challenge them to figure out where their idea of a newfoundland accent comes from - the media, newfie jokes, one person they met years ago, etc. if they're smart enough they'll come to recognize their own ignorance/insensitivity.

long answer, but i get this a lot, and i fucking hate it.

	<TEXT> In my field it is extremely common for teachers to pursue relationships with students or former students. My undergrad supervisor and two grad school supervisors all married former students (two of the couples are still together). Also, several of my grad school classmates are now with their former students. When I became a teacher myself I swore I would never pursue a student not only because it is morally reprehensible, but also because it is tacky and predictable. And I never have. The end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a toss up for me between Super Mario Bros 3 and Dragon Warrior 4. SMB3 was just so imaginative with a great variety of environments and perfectly designed action. DW4 represents the pinnacle of NES narrative and gameplay depth. The two games are so different from each other that it's impossible to pick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rick killing Joe by biting his throat out. It was absolutely one of the most terrifying moments of the whole series. Joe promising Rick that he'd see his friend and his son be raped to death before he was beaten to death himself. Rick having no opportunity or resources except to resort to the most brutal, visceral, and violent form of self-defense. The parallel made between walkers who consume living flesh and our survivors who had to bite someone's jugular out to survive. The incredibly touching moment in the aftermath where Rick tells Daryl that they are "brothers", a relationship that has arguably been the most important in the whole series. Not to mention the incredible beauty of the scene itself in terms of lighting, colour, and action. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The episode you mentioned is called Genesis and I agree it would be a good choice to start with. You want to be sure you pick a good episode that doesn't require too much knowledge of the Star Trek universe or a lot of character backstory. Some amazing episodes won't have their full effect, like Yesterday's Enterprise, for instance, which is much better when you know who Tasha Yar is, as well as some basic 24th Century Alpha Quadrant history. In addition to those episodes others have mentioned I would also suggest Who Watches The Watchers, Rascals, Tapestry, Q Who, First Contact, Disaster, Cause and Effect, and Schisms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Not everyone will be losers in a climate change scenario.

True, some people will get worse weather while others get better weather. But even if only a tiny fraction of Earth's population is negatively affected it's going to have a negative effect on everyone. A 2.5m sea level rise is going to create 100,000,000 climate refugees in Bangladesh alone. Where are they going to go? An unusually long drought in sub-Saharan Africa will create another hundred million migrants. That's an order of magnitude greater than the number of Syrian civil war refugees, a conflict which, it has been argued, has climate-change-caused drought as one of its root causes (and we've already seen how that situation has reverberated around the world and caused destabilization in Africa, Asia, the Europe Union, and the United States. Nobody wins from climate change, because the climate change losers make life miserable for everyone else). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's some storm surge damage from "basically" a post tropical storm on October 16 2016. Lots of inland damage but plenty of ocean side structures washed away as well (I remember seeing more at the time but can't seem to find them at the moment). My neighbour's basement was flooded by the surge during this event too - the first flooding he can recall at his house. Storm surge and sealevel rise are already causing significant damage. https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/10-tweets-damaging-newfoundland-flooding/73136 </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Newfoundlanders used to float their houses

In the 1950s and 60s fishermen floated their houses. They're not going to do it again now that the people are 70 or 80 years old. Houses won't be moved by current owners, and the real estate will have zero value so no one will ever buy them. Best case scenario is they will be demolished before they pollute the ocean. Worst case scenario is that communities will be wiped off the map not simply because houses get washed away, but because the cost of rebuilding an entire community will be much more than a community with no great future is worth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it was all going good until I got into Kraid's Lair, then I simultaneously ran out of vertical space and ran out of space for the middle part, which I had to make an inset for. Also needed an inset for Ridley's Lair, but since I started it at the entrance it was fine. If I'd had any idea that the beginning of the game was near the top left I would've done the map in portrait instead of landscape, and placed the starting point appropriately. </TEXT>
