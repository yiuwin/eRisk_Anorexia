	<TEXT> If that's how you feel about this thread than so be it. It was merely a discussion that i started for some civilized chat about hockey and how non lightning fans feel about our team this year. I think our team is awesome but there are so many good teams and it's all about matchups at this point. I was just remarking about certain fans saying we only won because of easy teams where as if we were on the other side of the brackets we would have been out first round. but i do appreciate all your input :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your input, i'm glad you decided to comment with some background and knowledge of the sport and i'll keep that in mind that i'm coming off salty. I'm not feeling salty we are 8-2 in the playoffs so no need to be mad. I just wanted to know what people thought about us as a smaller market team :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the response and btw I think the Islanders were by far one of the most underrated teams this year. I mean they had their downsides but  that series easily could have gone 7.  If Tavares gets a little more support around him and he does his thing you guys are gonna be top tier in my eyes! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question for non-Lightning fans about the Lightning. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-10 23:02:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This years playoffs and last I have stumbled upon what i believe to be simple trolls or ignorant fans. But the Lightning have been in cup contention for these years and i've heard the same things each of these years. Last year it was "You guys will never beat the Canadiens." and after we beat them "You guys will never beat the Rangers." Of course the Lightning went on to the finals against Chicago with an injured Tyler Johnson (wrist) and an injured Ben Bishop (groin) and played both guys in their 4-2 series loss. (not saying the hawks didn't have injuries too!) But this year i'm hearing we had the easiest 2 teams and easiest side of the bracket in the playoffs (which i'm not denying at all!). Now all i hear is how the penguins (which we went 3-0 i believe against this season) and the caps (who i believe we went 0-3 agains this season) will destroy the lightning and are superior teams.  Mind you I've heard the same complain in the west from certain teams fans saying they played the strongest teams first too. I'm not saying the playoff layout is perfect or "fair" but I got tired of all the backlash the past two years the Lightning have had. My question is to all the other teams is; are we a revered team around the league or in general do people really think we've been lucky or something? I do truly believe we have a great team and have a decent shot at the Pens/Caps series coming up and the cup (especially with Stammer and Stralman coming back). </TEXT>
