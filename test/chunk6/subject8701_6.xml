	<TEXT> You can still get the statistics. Br print them. Various crimes stopped being recorded over the years. This is mainly due to the way in which information is recorded. Because not everything recorded is actual crime, it can cause issues with groups being targeted. Your best bet is to look at convictions.

The BBC have covered Rape in Sweden in quite a bit of depth. 

http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39056786

They actually put out articles regularly. I am not sure about other sources. I provide people with information about this (I am regularly contacted by media outlets), but I never check whether they use it or not.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By making that statement, it is evident that you have done zero research into why rape rates in Sweden are so high. Hint: it goes well beyond the definition being changed. Having spent 10 years researching it, I can honestly tell you that Sweden has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, rape rates in Europe. 

Research how rape is recorded in Sweden then get back to me. In fact, better yet, my post sums it up.

https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/60jut9/nigel_farage_investigated_by_ofcom_after_rape/df7i6i8/

Extra hint: most of the rapes aren't even immigrants.

Now, you are probably going to come back with some bullshit argument. So, I am just going to respond to you and all those replies right now:

You are wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Borders not get closed. That is just a stupid assumption.

Countries need migration to survive. EU Residents are going to be less likely to come to the UK for work. As a result, the UK needs to look abroad for people to prop up the economy. In fact, there are scores of people waiting to get jobs in the country, which they would have been unable to get before due to the EU limiting migration.

You are silly if you believe that the borders are going to be closed. Migration will remain at the same levels, it will just come from other parts of the world.  </TEXT>

You never educated yourself about how tough it is to migrate to the UK from the EU, did you? And how tough it can be to remain. 

You also fail to realise that a company needs immigration to thrive. Immigration is going to be exactly the same going forward, only the immigrants are not going to come from just the EU, they are going to come from all over the world.

	<TEXT> No. Not really.

It started because my contracts were mostly tied to remaining in the EU. Well, sort of. It was not so much EU work, but these British companies no longer wished to invest in their UK operations to the plummeting value of the pound. Within 2 days of the EU vote going through, six companies bought themselves out of their contract. This is because they felt they would be better poised to start marketing themselves elsewhere in the EU.

But, you will be pleased to know that I had to put 5 people into unemployment in the UK.

Cap this off with the fact that some of my staff are paid in SEK, which was abysmal when the exchange rates changed so rapidly, and it was a disaster.

So, don't tell me how it is due to me not managing my cash flow. It was due to the shoddy decision to leave the EU and the impact in my industry is going to be felt for years to come.

I am just a small company. I dread to think what larger companies are going through. They may be able to cope now, but when we leave the EU good and proper, companies *will* crumble. 

Why are you pleased to leave the EU? What are your benefits? </TEXT>

And yes, we have a right to reform. We did not have a right to totally change the makeup of the EU, did we? It is a group of countries. Not one country dictating all the terms.

And no, we do not have a right to leave without being 'punished'. The EU have to ensure that they continue to thrive without the UK. They are there for themselves now, not for us.  </TEXT>

- Found a new place to live (woo)
- Oh no. All my money has been locked up by Skrill for investigation into money laundering (which I do not do). This meant I lost the 'new' place.
- I live in Sweden, not necessarily a bad thing, but I can't really rely on my parents to help as they are in a different country. 
- My dog then died
- My card stopped working at cash machines so I can't withdraw any money until I get to my bank which is an hour away.
- I pissed off all my friends
- The cat then died
- Clients are threatening me.
- 100% sure I am coping with depression

	<TEXT> Going by Emma Watson quotes here:

http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39513543

"To me, it indicates that acting is about the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, and that doesn't need to be separated into two different categories."

So, should they be scrapped? Should we just have single categories for acting? Allow us to choose the 'best of the best'? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry. Another article I read in the past said they were unsure as to how much he paid. I just sent the first link I sent about it.

I am very open minded. But you are flat-out denying that Trump is a terrorist supporter.

So, answer me this:

Did Trump attend an event run by leaders of a terrorist group?

Did Trump pay to attend that meeting?

Is it likely that he donated while he was there?

Did King, one of the top politicians in the administration, donate to NORAID?

And none of this whataboutism from you. </TEXT>
