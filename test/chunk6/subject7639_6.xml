	<TEXT> Also, in parts of asia and most of africa, most provinces are underdeveloped and even if you create a large empire in those areas, most buildings are actually not very good, because they yield little benefit in return. What would be the good thing to do with my money in those areas ? 
(Bukhara could be an example) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you build manufactories ? I heard they pay double because they also add to trade value, and when playing countries like Ming I thought a good tactic would be save money until tech 11, and then just use it all to build manufactories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good guide overall, but I didn't understand how you managed to get 120k army with ottos by 1500. If you could explain that, that would be great. I would just run out of cash </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its 1490 in my game now, and I have reached Constantinople, and sacked them for their worship of Jesus. I have around 40K of an army, and I'm equal with the westerns in mil tech. Most of my army is cavalry. But I don't have enough states to sustain my empire, and I'm only making 25 ducats a month. I barely survive off that, and I don't really gain much extras from it. I always go to the negative side when I go to war. Is there any way I can improve  my financial situation ? I don't want to reform yet, I have to keep going to Europe. </TEXT>
