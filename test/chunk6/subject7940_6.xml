I mean, by not being available all-around, maybe there is a clue there, but I believe it may not be something that important, you know.

Anyway, you who has access to it, what can you say me about it?

Just for curiosity, you said you have some random observations on it and I would like to know to see if any idea pops up. </TEXT>

As the the other commented answer explained, they did, I only received an e-mail from WordFence 6 hours earlier than the CloudFlare one.

I guess they had to think and work a lot in this case as I received a mail for non-damaged domains, so, probably they went directly to inform the damaged ones firstly. </TEXT>

Even some WordPress/CloudFlare websites were not damaged:

 Fortunately, your domain is not one of the domains where we have discovered exposed data in any third party caches. The bug has been patched so it is no longer leaking data. However, we continue to work with these caches to review their records and help them purge any exposed data we find. If we discover any data leaked about your domains during this search, we will reach out to you directly and provide you full details of what we have found. </TEXT>

It is my original thought too, but the problem is it would be pointing to its existence more than to something to do, I think, and the glyphs kind of would not match with the other ones found in numbers (in spite of being possible to have one more somehow or to count Omega's as one). </TEXT>

I had never thought about that the way I did here and it is just an idea, not a theory nor anything else, so, I would not discharge your view about it.

By the way, this idea is no revolutionary as it simply claims the *status quo* by associating the faded glyph with the fading UFO, thus, not showing us any new performatic possibility. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me neither, I must say; actually, reading this post and, mainly, viewing the image made me to think about that.

I mean, if the glyphs are all about the UFO, then, the faded one could be an analogy to one of its known features, I do not know; it would at least guarantee some in-game knowledge about its fading ability and it would not look like a problematic approach, but an advise about something that really happens around there. </TEXT>

I only played it once on my first playthrough and, before ending the mission, he did not make it and stood still on the ground.

Unfortunately, I just wanted him alive, so, I killed Franklin with an explosive before completing the mission because the three characters were already waiting to regroup in the end.

I am not sure if he would just resurrect after the mission, but I plan to try to have him killed in that mission again just to know what happens; unfortunately, it will take time till I replay it to report something new. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, Adobe and Autodesk are not cool with their systems and I did just like you: searched for another tools.

Ten years ago I used to mix MS Paint drawings with Photoshop filters to achieve something different, but soon I realized Adobe Photoshop was not a long term tool, I mean, the next installation I tried was a total different software and I did not get use to it nor wanted to.

I kind of left drawing aside for like 5 years when the MacOS Pixelmator and Sketchbook for iPad popped up while me and my girlfriend tried Apple and they were nice tools; we used Pixelmator to design some promotional material for long time and the shapes and features of Pixelmator are cool, the only problem is the system it is on (by the way, the tablet version has nothing to do with the original one).

I found iDraw, after some time she tried to, but soon it became Autodesk Graphic and the iPad got older and her Mac too; and we had to look for new tools again, fearing we would not be able to keep the pattern we used.

Inkscape was my choice as firstly I tried to just draw something with it, realized how nice it is, and now I prepare everything on it; she simplified her hardwork on these software, by using Canva, a internet tool that she is enjoying a lot.

Aseprite is my next bet, I have never made anything on it (everytime I try something on it, I get the taste of trying to make a pixel game, so, I have to slow down myself), but I am sure it is a powerful tool by just trying it.

Krita is another one I separated, but I still have to create something with it, just to try; when I got it, I got Inkscape too and it was easier for me to try first.

I am not an artist myself, but I like to test and use these software like I am, then, I always create something with them just to feel what can be done.

Here you can see some attempts with: [Paint](https://quaestio.org/category/paint/), [Photoshop](https://quaestio.org/category/photoshop/), [Pixelmator](https://quaestio.org/category/pixelmator/), [iDraw/Graphic](https://quaestio.org/category/graphic/), [Sketchbook](https://quaestio.org/category/sketchbook/), [Inkscape](https://quaestio.org/category/inkscape/). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought iDraw before becoming Autodesk Graphic and nothing changed since then, only my tablet got older and load time increased and crashes started to happen more frequently, so, I can not say great things about Autodesk besides being the owner of two apps I have; by the way, there was no revolutionary updates in years.

I noticed you mentioned, Krita, and it is interesting because it was in the list I discovered the best drawing software; I even installed it, but never used; I ask you: which ones do you use and indicate? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, I am not an affictionate myself, but, between the mentioned ones, it is the one I used and one of the few I have not unistalled yet on my old iPad, although I do not use it anymore nor the iPad.

I used it mostly long time ago for some raw design material and once for to create a fun drawing with my girlfriend and thought it could be useful if one master it.

Anyway, I am really into geometric precision, so, since when I discovered iDraw back then, I abandoned it and these kind of free drawing apps; even on desktop, I favor Inkspace, Aseprite and Paint for that as I use to work with lines, shapes and alignment.

I would never rely only on it nor on one app as I rarely use only one software while creating something, but it was at least useful in the past for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Autodesk Sketchbook is really a good option, I can say.

If you want more geometric precision, Autodesk Graphic (former iDraw) is the one.

It is also good to mix some apps while doing, like using one just to cut or to create a shape, then, continuing on another one where the artwork is set. </TEXT>

I was playing [Nicholson Electroplating](http://lanoire.wikia.com/wiki/Nicholson_Electroplating) and, after visiting [Hughes Aircraft](http://lanoire.wikia.com/wiki/Hughes_Aircraft) and passing by the Tech Service, places where the intro scene is shot and his photos are shown, coming back upstairs the NPC was there drinking water and quickly caught my attention as ideas about [Howard Hughes](http://lanoire.wikia.com/wiki/Howard_Hughes) was all around in this mission.

The first thought was he was there following the case related with his business, a scenery that could fit well in a mission like this one; so, I watched some [videos](https://youtu.be/vnUg9tZ9s44?t=30m31s) and noticed the same NPC pops up in the [Wilshire Police Station](http://lanoire.wikia.com/wiki/Wilshire_Police_Station) most times in this case (different outfits and positions, but same model); also, I replayed another arson mission, [The Gas Man](http://lanoire.wikia.com/wiki/The_Gas_Man), and he was there from the beginning in the back with a hat (interesting is that after the [cutscene](https://youtu.be/i3ZZkX1LYbc?t=1m37s), I tried to look him closer, but the NPC disappeared; unfortunately, this video does not show that).

Another detail in this mission that was really weird to notice is what Cole Phelps said when he saw this real photo of a guy with a mustache by the end of the mission: "[Hangstrom and McLellan are the same man](https://youtu.be/vnUg9tZ9s44?t=32m9s)"; if you are there thinking about Mr Hughes possible appearance, it looks like a conclusive answer somehow.

Like you observed, it really can be a reuse, anyway it is a reuse of a very special NPC; also, it is funny to see how Rockstar deals with reuses when they do, just like another [coincidental NPC](http://imgur.com/6VCzIA7) I spotted last year in GTA V which is both depicted as a wanted criminal and the staff manager of a bank (where a [heist](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/The_Paleto_Score) happens). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It really is fascinating to behold.

I can only say the same!

I started staring it confused whether it was a comet or, indeed, a ship on fire; realized the stars in the sky and the tip of the iceberg: it would be enough already.

Then, I started scrolling down, noticed the water goes deeper and the supposed continuation of the iceberg; down there, a whale. </TEXT>
