	<TEXT> With the Spread of news of the Texan independence party, its membership has swollen to some 150,000 strong. The majority of this new blood is not, however, new. After talking with several members and delegates, the most common background for these members was their participation in the original independence movement, during which the United States fragmented in to the states present today: The Midwest, Orleans, Florida, and The United States of Columbia. However, the ranks of the party are expected to swell more and more as they campaign for both members and seats in the government. </TEXT>
