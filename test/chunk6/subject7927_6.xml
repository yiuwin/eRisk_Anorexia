	<TEXT> Honestly that's my first thought.. I work in child care and yes children get very hard to tolerate some times. But I am an educator and there is ways to deal with that. A child should never be scared to thinking their about about to get hit... And then to say your wife does it. THAT is where it is coming from. So disappointing  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work in child care and this is the number one thing I make sure I don't do with the kids...  Yes or no questions...

Always give them a choice even though it can be the most ridiculous ...    "Do you want to wear this hat or this hat"? Not "can you please put on your hat". They think they are the ones making the choice and it most of the time works.... 

Also try to take the word no out of your vocabulary ... "No running" . all the kid hears is "running!!!!!"
Instead say "please walk".  </TEXT>
