	<TEXT> 3 times a week 1 and a half hours is plenty. You can get really good results with that. Even better results than guys who train 6 days a week but follow stupid brosplits. You just have to have a good full-body training program. You can use supersets to get more work done in less time. Alternate pull ups with bench press. Do rotator cuff exercises between squats. Just find a good full body program from the wiki. If you can't make it to the gym, follow the bodyweight workout program from r/bodyweightfitness. if you think you will not make good gains, you never will. That is how it works.

	<TEXT> It's not a stupid question. But yeah a muscle group just refers to individual muscles. However, you can't do 20 sets per week for chest, back, traps, shoulder, biceps, arms, hamstrings, glutes and quadriceps of course. So you need to prioritize. Also, compound exercises will target multiple muscle groups at once which makes it a lot more complex. You don't have to do 20 sets of curls per week because you are also doing pullups and rows (hopefully).

	<TEXT> "Higher frequencies for smaller muscle groups, lower for larger ones". Arm muscles recover quicker than you big leg muscles,  so you don't want to 'just' do heavy squats on upper body days.

	<TEXT> I don't really know what you are trying to say with this statement... yes you posted a link that I read and included in this thread... So what? I already knew about his stuff. The sole purpose of this thread is to share some really good sources on lifting for hypertrophy. My own experience level is irrelevant as long as I post sound information. I am not saying by any means that I am an expert on the subject on sports science, but Mike Israetel is... so I shared some of his best work with other people. What is wrong with that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! I much prefer this  article  https://renaissanceperiodization.com/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth/  though, because it goes much more in depth yet it takes less time to read than to watch that video.

	<TITLE> General recommendations for hypertrophy by Dr. Mike Israetel </TITLE>

	<TEXT> **Hey guys! I just want to share this piece of knowledge with y'all. It's from Mike Israetel's Facebook page - great stuff! I think Mike Israetel really knows his stuff. The advices below are for people who are mainly interested in size gains. However, Israetel also has some great stuff about powerlifting since he also works with Juggernaut Training Systems. If you wanna read more of his stuff, check this out first: https://notehub.org/6cvvk. Have a great day!**


"General recommendations for hypertrophy training:

*1.) Volume:*
15-25 working sets per muscle group per week
* Make sure to start on the very low end of what you can recover from (MRV)

*2.) Frequency:*
2-4 days per muscle group per week 
* Higher frequencies for smaller muscle groups, lower for larger ones
** 60% of the total volume in half the workouts, 40% of the volume in the other half (to promote recovery and adaptation)

*3.) Intensity:*
55-85%1RM of the exercise you're doing

*4.) Programming:*
Accumulation 3-6 weeks of adding about 2% weights to the exercises per week and 1-2 sets per muscle group (not exercises) per week
Deload 1 week with the first half of the week as heavy as the first week of accumulation but with half the sets, and the second half of the week with half the sets and weight of the first week

*5.) Periodization:*
During weight gain,
1-2 mesocycles of mostly sets of 8-12 reps
1-2 mesocycles of mostly sets of 12-20 reps, with one of those mesos including drop sets, supersets, ultra high rep sets, and/or occlusion
During weight maintenance,
1 mesocycle of mostly sets of 4-8 reps with 2/3 the usual set amounts (to bring down fatigue and re-sensitize for growth)

Plenty of exceptions on the details, especially for folks just starting out and those who have been training longer than 15 years. But, these are some ok staring points from my experience in coaching, training myself, and my reading of the literature."

EDIT: Also please note that these recommendations are for intermediate and advanced lifters! You don't have to follow this stuff if you are a beginner, in fact, it is better to follow a simple beginner program.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is one of Christian Thibadeau's programs. To me it doesn't look good. Too much variation, too much machines and too much fancy intensity techniques. I think you are better off with full body-workouts. But you could do it and it would probably get you results.
