	<TITLE> Im curious to know what George Lucas' rejected script for VII was. Do you reckon we might be able to see it some time soon? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> According to [starwarsnewsnet.com](http://www.starwarsnewsnet.com/2016/06/iain-mccaig-talks-about-production-on-the-force-awakens-hints-at-star-wars-episode-viii-plot.html)

Lucas initially wanted nothing to do with VII, but in a short while after pre-production began, he decided he wanted to submit a script. He brought in Ian and another prequel artist (possibly Doug Chiang, I missed the name) to the Ranch to help him realize his concepts. The script was rejected outright, as a result of
Disneys banishment of anything mildly prequel-related. Usage of prequel-only characters, environments etc were banned, as to not incur the fan bases wrath.

Even though i loved TFA, a little part of me still wants to know what George planned for the movie and which prequel characters he had included in the script. And what the movie may have looked like without this major restriction imposed by Disney. Do you think this would ever get released to the public?

	<TEXT> A lot of (great) music these days has an intro and an outro.

The intro builds us up for the big bass drop
The outro summarizes what we just experienced and tries to keep the feelings go on for longer.

I think Star Wars is the same. The opening crawl just gets us all pumped up even though it might be unnecessary since everyone basically now knows whats going on in the galaxy. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think some things are better untouched.. Not sure i'd be happy with a re-introduced Thrawn, Katarn, Jade, Revan etc . I feel like if they did, they would put a different spin to them that might spoil them. What do you think?

I'd much prefer they introduce new characters that reflect the above mentioned almost entirely but just with different names/faces etc. At least that way we can get the best of both old and new canon without fears of spoiling. what do u think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What kind of stories do you think they could tell in a peaceful period? 

Perhaps we would be limited to the personal exploits of various characters where the stories dont have a significant impact on the galaxy. i.e Luke's adventures searching for Jedi Lore ( taking on a more Indiana Jones kind of story) or Han's racing or smuggling stories for example. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [spoilers] the period between the battle of Jakku and the events of Bloodline </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-01 15:50:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Bloodline is the first canon novel i have read to completion and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed every page of it. At first i was hesitant to read a Star Wars novel that was not primarily action and adventure based... but after half finishing Twilight Company and getting a little bored, i decided to pick up something new and different. Im glad i did.

The book seems to indicate that after the battle of Jakku, very little military conflict occurred between the New Republic and enemy forces (such as the Empire). This is in stark contrast to the EU where the whole period was filled with constant conflict. First with the Imperials and then with the Yuuzan Vong. 

I guess part of the reason for the constant war that occured after ROTJ in the EU was just the authors of the books and game developers going nuts delivering Star Wars fans content that they know and love. Seeing as their where no more films to come out.

But now it seems that with the new films coming out, the period bewteen ROTJ and Bloodline in the new canon appears to be much quieter. Han Solo gets into space racing, Chewbacca goes back to his homeworld etc...

How do people feel about this? Do you think the new canon will introduce a less involved, more quieter period between ROTJ and TFA and have a more involved post TFA world?

	<TITLE> laws and regulations regarding the bringing back of imitation antique pistols from overseas to Australia? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-01 04:56:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is my first submission here. Sorry if i have posted in the wrong subreddit.

I have been trying to find information regarding the importing of antique imitation firearms. Information on DIBP's [website](https://www.border.gov.au/Busi/Impo/Proh/Firearms-and-weapons/imitation-firearms) contains only information about guns that could be mistaken for modern working firearms

For example, if someone was to buy from overseas a souvenir 19th century-era Ottoman miqueletlock holster pistol like those [here](https://p2.liveauctioneers.com/1521/31705/12554821_1_l.jpg)   or [here](https://p2.liveauctioneers.com/1250/38078/16217487_1_l.jpg) ( both .jpg links)
could one safely bring that back to Australia? or is there a special process one needs to go through to obtain permission to bring these back?
