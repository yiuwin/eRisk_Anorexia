	<TEXT> FiveThirtyEight has a [nice diagram](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/wasserman-landslides1.png?quality=90 strip=all w=1150 ssl=1) showing the rapid decline of competitive districts.

That also shows how dominant the Republicans have become in rural America. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the rise of news sources with fringe political leanings is the key here. Even when the country was not polarized, there was always government corruption (i.e. IRS corruption scandal under Truman) and crazy politicians (i.e. McCarthy).

But what's changed since the 1990s is that the big news outlets, such as ABC, CBS, and NBC, have all declined. These sources are generally center-left, but the new media that is now taking over is more extreme and scattered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Calling yourself an independent or unaffiliated isn't saying much. Most "independents" are very partisan ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/11/independents-outnumber-democrats-and-republicans-but-theyre-not-very-independent/?utm_term=.b64fb0ca5d16)). As far as party registration, I showed you that journalists do not represent the American population at all. </TEXT>
