12:45 PM on the 19th.
Furthest back row, right smack dab in the center.

The theater was actually pretty empty, except for a few seats here and there, and two large groups (a 7 and an 8) that were down in the middle.

Fortunately, the theater (building) serves a somewhat small population, so my odds were good.

Tried to get the 10:45, but the pick-a-seat thing wasn't loading.
Oh well. Less morning rush! </TEXT>

Or, more realistically, what is preventing me from flying to Toronto, getting a printed copy for a couple bucks (since it's now PD there and it's just to recoup publishing costs) and flying back? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The office was far more decorated now. The painting from the senator from Serenno sits on the wall to the right of the entrance, just inside the often-open doorway.

Doing away with convention, he was as a one-man operation, as well as having eight exceedingly comfortable and identical chairs arranged in an octagonal formation where the desk normally would be. In the center is a small-to-medium sized table for datapads, refreshments and what-have-yous. Around the room are various historical and modern sculputes, paintings and knick-knacks he bought on Coruscant, and a few he had shipped in from his homeworld of Akiva, as well as a couple Naboo pieces, and an impressionist painting of a bantha from an artist on Tatooine.

Gannit Valeris sat in the chair facing the door, waiting for his guests, passing time listening to local audio entertainment programming on his in-ear receivers, while checking the latest news from around the galaxy and replying to messages from his fellow Akivans.

"But pretty much everyone there has a gun, since we are so far from everything. It took me three weeks to get here. That far. Because it's a very arms-friendly planet, being so rural, might BlasTech be interested in opening up shop on the planet? It is a ways out, but you would have a monopoly, at least for a while. I could, perhaps, even negotiate for a one year guaranteed monopoly, as long as you don't gouge us." Gannit said with a smile and a wink. "We do have plenty of local arms makers, so you know. And because, for them, it's their livelihood, I wouldn't want you to shut them down, but, perhaps, you could collaborate with them? Buy designs off of them, or even bring them on full-time as designers? Something like that." </TEXT>

Gannit paused, creating a moment of awkward silence.

"I wanted to apologize if I intruded on anything when we met my first day here. I know it said "near-human", but I wanted to meet my fellow senators, and your office was open. That's been sitting on me for a while and I just wanted to clear the air." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Ideally, with enough funding and support, it would run from Dac, all the way around," said Gannit, illustrating with a finger, back to Dac. Or Csilla to Csilla. You get the idea."

He paused to take a breath, then resumed, "Realistically, probably from Dac to Csilla, but with worlds in-between, including Akiva. Both of their respective senators are all but committed to the idea, if that makes it any more appealing. Though, in the interest of full disclosure, the senator from Csilla would like a proposal, in-hand, to present to his government to help convince them. I have a few other senators open to the idea, but nothing concrete as of yet." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Building on what /u/listyraesder said

Trek rights aren't that complicated.
In 2000, Viacom bought CBS, and merged Paramount Television (producers of Star Trek) into CBS. In 2005, Viacom split up into CBS Corporation (CBS, what was Paramount TV including UPN, etc) and a new Viacom (Paramount Pictures, MTV Networks). This is why UPN and The WB merged into The CW, as UPN was now part of CBS.
Now, Viacom and CBS Corp are both owned by National Amusements, and the rights to Trek were split up so that the feature film rights went to Paramount and the TV rights went to CBS. But as they're sibling companies, priority goes to the one which is raking in the money.
At the moment, Paramount is making massive bank on Trek films, and is opposed to any new Trek TV because they're operating on a specific cycle of supply-and-demand and a series might impact their film's performance.
CBS is co-owner of The CW, which is run by Mark Pedowitz. He is extremely keen on having a new Trek series, to the point where he brings it up with CBS Studios quite regularly. However, as Paramount won't give their blessing, there's no current plans to go for it. He especially wanted one for the 50th anniversary but hey.


Paramount also has to pay CBS licensing for any TV characters used (e.g. Kirk, Spock, et al.), and vice versa. So, for *First Contact*, Paramount had to pay CBS to use the TNG characters, but then CBS had to pay Paramount to use the Borg Queen in *Voyager*, for example.

So, it is somewhat complicated, but not a massive clusterfuck. Somewhere about a Marvel level of fuckitude. </TEXT>
