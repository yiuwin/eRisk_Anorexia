	<TEXT> In Modern specifically, I think it has a lot to do with creatures that are at 3 toughness - that is, bolt targets. There are probably plenty of creatures that would massively playable if you just increased the toughness to 4. 

EDIT: Playable is one thing, but the OP was asking what card would be banned. It's actually hard to think of cards which would for sure meet that requirement.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I mean, it's a semi-joke post. Reprints like Birds, IoK, and Serum Visions are more about making Modern folks happy. But, it is also crazy how many NEW cards they made for this set that are truly exciting for eternal formats - as compared to say, Worldgorger dragons.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only thing that really bugged me was the drone camera that was constantly moving during the interviews. It didn't ruin the Pro Tour or anything but I just wonder if they did that to be fancy? Is it cheaper than having a camera man?
On the subject of glare, maybe I don't know enough but can't they just do a test game to adjust lighting accordingly to minimize glare? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, "completely off-flavor" is going too far. It is, after all, *literal* crop rotation. I'm not mad this exists, it's awesome and fun, these were just my first thoughts. Also, I'm biased as I think Crop Rotation is one of the biggest homerun's flavor-wise. Just based on the title and the function of the card, it's perfect - and that's before getting to the original flavor text.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if anybody else was expecting this, but I thought when I right-clicked on the number amount for a specific card, it would reduce by one.
