	<TEXT> I definitely know what you mean. It's like I automatically think of it as a bother before I even know what it is. About a year ago, I didn't have my phone for about a week (cause it got stolen) and I've never felt more free lol. I wish I had the nads to give it up by choice </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And you're entitled to that opinion. Personally though, I feel that since we are the dominant species it's almost like our responsibility to make sure that those who are weaker than us are as protected (within reason obviously) as they can be. I heard a quote once that went something like this: 'You can tell how good a person is by how they treat those below them' And I think that it can relate to this topic as well </TEXT>
