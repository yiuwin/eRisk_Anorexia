	<TEXT> I listen to a really wide variety of music. I listen to a lot of Kpop (I'm American), which leads people to think that I'm like obsessed with Asians (I just really like things from different cultures). I also listen to some death metal/scream-o (Arch Enemy, for example), which makes me seem like a metal head or some really hardcore chick (I'm not lol). Then I listen to pop punk (like The Wonder Years, for example - my favorite band) and I guess I kinda fit that stereotype. A rebellious kid trying to find her place in the world. And then I listen to EDM and stuff and some rap and pop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes I have the thought that my life isn't real, and neither is anyone else's. Like life in general isn't real. And then I think, "Right this very second, who am I? Is life even real? Have all my achievements in life been fake and just some sort of delusion? Who are these people around me? Do we all really exist? Does anything exist?" And then I push the thought out of my brain and go back to whatever I was doing. I don't like to think about it for too long. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not Tinder, but OK Cupid. Went on a date with the guy, but he was kinda awkward but I shrugged it off as first-date jitters. Then he keeps bringing up his ex (which everyone with a brain knows is a big no-no). He drops me off at home, and then I, not knowing how to turn people down, invite him inside. After about an hour of nothing, I finally get him out of my house. But of course, being the idiot human being I am, kissed him goodbye before he left.

I felt zero chemistry on the date. He, however, obviously did and started texting me hearts and all this ooey-gooey stuff the next day. I didn't know how to tell him that I wasn't interested, but I eventually did and he flipped out. He told me that I broke his heart and that he thinks I might be the one and to please give him another chance. This guy was 19 and acting like a 14-year-old. He kept calling me a bitch and saying that I led him on and stuff. Right ok. We went one 1 date and had only been talking for like a week. THEN he throws out the "my life sucks" card, and starts talking about how he's been suicidal in the past, so I apologized and told him he needs to find someone who is going to treat him right and that it shouldn't be that hard. He kept saying he was gonna come over and "make it right." Luckily, I live in a gated neighborhood, so I was safe. Eventually, he stopped texting me and I was free. 

Uh, so now I stick to using dating apps for hooking up.

**TL;DR: Met a guy off OK Cupid who flipped out on me not wanting to date him.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have quite a few, but here are the most memorable:

 When I was 7, I tried to ride an electric scooter with no hands and ended up breaking my leg. I had to wear a cast all the way up to my thigh, then a cast up to my knee, then a boot, and then a brace of over the span of a few months.

 Between the ages of 4 and 6, my friend and I would jump off her bed and I almost bit my tongue in half several times. 

 When I was 9, I was chewing on the end of a red gel pen and had it explode in my mouth. I was at my aunt's house and she thought it was blood and almost called the hospital. I initially didn't tell her it was from the pen because I thought she'd get mad at me.

 When I was 5, I got the stomach flu and ended up puking all over my friend's kitchen instead of walking literally 2 feet to the trash can.

 Between the ages of 3 and 4, I liked to dance with my pet chihuahua. By dance, I mean I'd have him and on his hind legs and hold his front legs. I got bit so many times   never learned my lesson.

 This one is my favorite   it happened when I was 3 or 4: For some reason, the alarm in the house I  lived in with my parents decided to malfunction for no reason. It ended up sending a distress signal to the police saying that someone was being held at gunpoint. There were all these helicopters over our house and police sirens and no one had any clue what was happening until a couple officers knocked on the door and told us they recieved a distress signal from the alarm company. Naturally, my dad explained that it must've been a malfunction and that everything is fine. I was in my room and I actually knew what was going on because my parents explained it to me. However, just as the police were about to leave, I decided to start screaming my ass off for no reason. My parents tried to explain that it was just me, their daughter. Because of me being a little bitch and screaming my lungs out, we had to get our entire house searched. They obviously found nothing and left. Apparently I was screaming because I wanted my sippy cup
