	<TEXT> Thank you targeted advertisements for having [this](https://viralstyle.com/c/1lMOl#pid=44 cid=6377027 sid=front) pop up in my Facebook newsfeed. A festive fun-for-the-whole-family Berserk Christmas-y sweater which many of you'll probably enjoy. 

It's only available to order for the next ~30 hours for those of you who might be interested.

	<TEXT> Not the same in most ways, but Bokurano. It's got the overpoweringly hopeless atmosphere like in Berserk's most pivotal moments while being just as tragic, if not more-so. It's definitely something and not very long. 

Shamo is pretty similar to Berserk in terms of its brutality and the antihero MC (arguable with Guts, I suppose).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, given how fantastic so many of these authors are, it's highly unlikely this will be a regretful decision. My highschool teachers and current English professor love talking about and recommending some of their favourite works, or even works they believe would be influential, which has been fantastic. Similar situation with my current Intro. to Philosophy prof. 

Works by authors like these has been really eye-opening and fascinating as a physics major. Can't quite pinpoint how, but they seem to have expanded my perspective well beyond what it would have been without them.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your and Pharaoh_Ibra's answer helped significantly. There was a feeling that the way I thought of the sine and cosine functions was itself incorrect, and you two enunciated it better than I was able to. There was a fundamental misunderstanding that I couldn't shake off, that sine and cosine could be shown algebraically, which doesn't seem to be the case. Thanks!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It helped quite a bit, actually. There was always a nagging feeling when I tried figuring this out and you just articulated it for me: sine and cosine can't be written algebraically. Thank you!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your reply (alongside others) have helped. Sine and Cosine functions are both *functions* (as well as geometric ideas) which I thought could be expressed arithmetically like x^n. However, if my understanding is now correct, they're more intrinsic, like log(x); an input is 'x' and the output, 'n', is whatever satisfies 10^n = x rather than an algebraic calculation (if the nomenclature is correct)?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No complaints here. It's making me want to explore his works more and more given the time. If you don't mind me asking, was literature your major in college? 

I've read a bit of Gaiman--*Good Omens*, with Terry Pratchett and currently going through *Sandman*, most notably--and absolutely adore his works. Getting increasingly tempted to drop by downtown tomorrow evening just to get *The Book of the New Sun* haha.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's really quite an amazing feat. It sounds like it's one of the few pieces of literature where a re-read is arguably "better" than the initial. 

If you've got the time and interest, one of my absolute favourite series is a Japanese trilogy called *From the New World* (translated from *Shin Sekai Yori*). Someone translated the books [here](http://shinsekai.cadet-nine.org/); although not quite life-changing, there are similar aspects: bits from the first book which may seem like forced exposition or useless information (including implications) which later become major plot points. It's also a science fiction novel with in the guise of a fantasy/historical fiction series. Might be something you would enjoy.  </TEXT>
