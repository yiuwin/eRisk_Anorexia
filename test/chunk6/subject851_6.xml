	<TEXT> Ah I see. Thanks for answering and giving an example. But then again, that's just applying rules again right? Say you had to differentiate with respect to y, and y is some function. Just apply chain rule and you have the answer right?

The thing is I know what you were talking about now, but when you presented it like that I had no idea of what you meant. 
The thing is I love physics, so I learn a lot of it on the side and learning physics means learning maths. And while I love maths, when I'm learning physics I tend to not want to delve into the formality of maths. So I just learn the rules and whatever is necessary to do the physics, but not the whole framework. 

For instance I know some vector calculus, some calculus of variations and how to solve Gaussian integrals, but ask me about the idea behind the delta function, or some of the more complex ideas behind calculus of variations, or to prove my solutions to the Gaussian integrals in a formal way, and I draw a blank.  I call this sort of learning "counting the beans", because of how Mayans taught maths. Priests knew the rules for doing addition and so on, but the regular people were not allowed to learn them. So they would learn how to add by taking jars of beans and counting. They had something functional, but they had no idea of what they were doing. And I also don't know some terminology because I just know the functionality.

Of course, I do learn the theory behind the maths whenever I can, because I really hate the fragile understanding brought by "counting the beans".  </TEXT>

Really sorry for the long post. I had a lot to say. Read it whenever you can, be it a month, year, century or aeon (I'll read your reply from heaven). 

Sure, and no need to thank me for the civil tone. It is a given. 

I see. Thanks for clarifying what you meant by faith. I learnt something new today. But I was talking about faith in general. The Bible may mean it differently, but I meant that religion is based on the dictionary definition of faith. Then again, you'd probably know this better than me. 

And I agree that evidence is not an endpoint and open to interpretation. However, I believe that as more and more evidence will come, the evidence by itself will paint a picture. Thus, the subjectiveness of evidence is because we need more evidence. It's a lot like empiricism. 

But I also get what you are saying, as I am a strong proponent of empiricism. What counts is that whatever you come up with agrees with evidence. It cannot disagree with evidence. For instance, Ptolemy's solar system was a pretty good model at the time of Copernicus. There was no actual reason to posit that the Earth was not the centre of the system, except that for that to agree with evidence, the planets had to go round in circles that went round in circles and it was really complicated. The point is, it worked just as well as the alternative. Therefore at the time, either model was viable because it agreed with evidence. 

With time, Ptolemy's model was evicted and Copernicus's model was slightly revised because planets went in ellipses and kept. Kepler's laws and Newton's law of gravitation, both based on new evidence, adhered to the model of Copernicus. So one could say that new evidence is what discredited Ptolemy. Another example is relativity and quantum mechanics: Newton's physics seemingly encompassed everything, but new evidence turned up around 200 years later and suggested a better model. 

Of course, I doubt that evidence can completely shape a model, for instance energy. But it should at least give a general form, and the models should be equivalent to each other: that is, a model should be able to move into the next. Well that's my opinion based on incomplete evidence, which I highly, highly doubt will ever be proven right (or wrong).

Also, I'm very curious about how thermodynamics and whatnot (I really like how thousands of years of research has become "whatnot") supports the Prime Mover. I can't see it, so if you wouldn't mind sharing with me? When you have time of course.

	<TEXT> Poor choice of words on my part, sorry. I didn't mean that faith opposes facts. But my last point still stands.
Faith, by the dictionary definition of google is:

strong belief in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual conviction rather than proof.

Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com give similar definitions.

Therefore, faith is the belief in something whether there is evidence or not, by definition. So religion cannot simultaneously be rooted in facts and in faith. 

Now, about evidence. Whether I find evidence persuasive or not is none of my business. Evidence is evidence, and I cannot deny the truth. 
Also rationality is in no way evidence. The Prime Mover is definitely rational, but evidence-based? It is not. What evidence do we have that it is true? At that point, Zeno's paradoxes are rational and I can argue that motion is an illusion. I can argue that Earth is still. 

Thermodynamics on the other hand, is evidence-based. We have observed countless times the ball never returning to its same height, the broken glass staying broken, the redshift, the elements' abundance and whatnot. In this case, one ascribes to the hypothesis that incorporates the most evidence, and the Prime Mover is not the one.

	<TEXT> Which is also what I was thinking. The first post does not seem to make that point though. It seems to say that people just accept the Bible without proof, even though it is completely absurd, like a floating teapot in outer space, not that one cannot provide evidence for the Bible because it moves the goalposts by blaming Satan or whatever when things go wrong. 

And while Russel's teapot was most likely an argument for God, I think it is an excellent tool for science as well, for it basically says, what you cannot test by experiment is not worth your time for you cannot detect it anyways. Philosophically speaking, it provides justification for the scientific method.  </TEXT>

Religion is more or less based in faith, which is literally the antithesis of facts and evidence, because faith is the belief in something, whether it is supported by facts or not.

	<TEXT> Did I miss the point of Russel's teapot? I always thought it was an argument that said that if you can show that something is unnecessary, then that's just as good as saying it does not exist.

Each time one fails to detect the teapot you can move the goalposts, saying that it is smaller than expected. But eventually all you are doing is saying that the teapot is so small, that no matter we do, we will fail to even notice its presence. In that sense, the teapot is as good as non-existent, so if you show that something cannot be detected, then it doesn't exist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see why you wouldn't be able to understand it at that stage. With some research you could do it. After all the book is written for the layman, and for most laymen, their science is not that much better than the middle school kid. (Not bashing, just an observation). 

Also, the book definitely doesn't waste shelf space because it can be useful. Besides, if the usefulness of a book is what determines its position, then throw out all fiction books. You could argue that they teach prose, but really, all books could do that, especially if you want to argue around the level of reading comprehension in middle school. 

My own (high and middle combined) school has the Feynman lectures volume 1 and 2 in their commemorative gold editions. (As you can tell I am very proud, one of the few things the school got right, and how right!). And while the level is vastly beyond that of the physics taught for most classes (heck we do maths with calculus but not physics with calculus. I demand an explanation), it has uses and is a fun read even if it did not.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Forces on a puck in a cylinder. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello.

Suppose that there is a cylinder, of radius R and mass M that is stationary on a floor. Now you add a puck of mass m, at R meters above the ground, on the inside of the cylinder. This gets the cylinder to roll without slipping. Here's a picture of what I am talking about:
http://imgur.com/a/vfsZ6

I'm supposed to find the reaction force when the puck is at the lowest point of the trajectory, which should be at the bottom of the cylinder. There is a solution given, but I'm not sure I follow:

The horizontal force the puck feels is N sin  = ma, where  is the angle from the vertical. 
The horizontal force on the cylinder is N sin  - f = Mw, where w is the acceleration of the cylinder and f the friction of the cylinder against the floor. 

The torque is Ij, where j is the angular acceleration of the cylinder and I its moment of inertia, MR^2, and since the cylinder is not slipping: j = w/R. And Ij = fR.
 Therefore f = Mw. 

So far so good. 
From this one can deduce that N sin  = 2Mw. One can also deduce that N sin = 2f.

But if the puck is at the bottom of the cylinder, sin  = 0. Then the above states that 2Mw = 0 and that 2f = 0 as well. But this cannot be the case, for I don't see how f would change, especially since the friction is not physically related to the normal force from the puck. Furthermore, the acceleration of the puck cannot be zero at the bottom of the cylinder as the equation suggests.
I'm pretty sure I am missing something but what?

Thanks for answering.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The entire build-up to the myth of Alcestis and Admetus. Apollo killed the cyclops who made Zeus's thunderbolts because Zeus had killed Asclepius (god of medicine and Apollo's son. Was killed because he could revive the dead). Apollo was bound to serve Admetus for a year. The king was very kind, and in exchange the god told him that when his time would come, someone else could take his place, but only if they chose to do so willingly. 

Admetus's parents, though aged refused to do so, and nobody wished to die for him. Nobody, save Alcestis, his wife. Evetually, Thanatos, the embodiment of death came for Admetus, and his wife volunteered. On the night, Heracles was passing through the kindgom of Admetus, and since the two were friends, Heracles headed to his residence for a feast. Admetus welcomed his friend with open arms, but told him nothing of the fate of his wife. The whole court was in mourning while Heracles feasted unaware. 

However, when Thanatos came for Alcestis, Heracles saw him carrying away the queen. He sprung to wrestle Death, and the demigod's strength was such that he was able to outmatch Thanatos in a death hug (pun intended). Death then left empty-handed. 

I also like the myth of Sisyphus, where he cheats death not once, but twice, and I like the myth of the walls of Troy. Apollo and Poseidon tried to overthrow Zeus, but they failed and were condemned to a year of labour under king Laomedon, as mortals instead. They built the famous walls of Troy, an impregnable fortress, save for the cunning of wily Odysseus.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on how extreme the veganism is. 

There are vegetarians, who eat eggs and dairy. I don't have any special opinion about them.

Then there are ovo-vegetarians who eat eggs but don't consume dairy. It sounds weird because why would you eat eggs but not dairy? But in the end I can't care less. 

Then there are lacto-vegetarians who consume dairy but not eggs. I think they are the most awesome people on the planet. Seriously the best people in the world. Can't beat them. Extremely good people. The coolest, funniest, overacheivers Streetlamp le Moose-like guys and gals.*

Then there are classic vegans who abstain from consuming all animal products. At this point the motive behind is probably because they worry about animals. For some reason, this usually correlates with snobbism. Those people annoy me to no end. But those that aren't snob are fine as long as they don't eat your ears out with their vegan ways. 

Then there are people who abstain completely from animal products. Those ones I can admire, for although I do not agree with their cause (not that I like animal deaths, I just think that it is a necessary evil), they essentially give up on a lot of things. Clothing, items, inks and food all contain a large percentage of animal derivatives which they must forego. That's tough, and they do it out of choice.

And some people don't necessarily give up meat because they care for animals. Some, like me, give up meat because they just don't like the taste of it. I didn't completely give up on meat: I very rarely (like perhaps six times a year tops) eat chicken, fish or eggs, but other than that I stick to vegetables and dairy. 

I literally cannot eat any other meat that the ones I listed above because I will vomit them. And I don't like eating chicken because it has to be cooked in a very specific way, and it has to be a very specific part of it (I think it is the breast but I can't remember). Eggs are the same (well not the parts but the cooking anyway). I only like tuna, cod and hake and even then the thorns make the food not worth the trouble. Same for chicken.

But if he means "nothing" causes the ball to fall, then I'm not too sure. 

A falling ball would be taking the shortest path between two points, but because space-time is curved in the presence of matter, the shortest path is not a straight line and the ball accelerates. In some sense the ball would be just following a natural path: the equivalent of a straight line in a curved space, so in some sense nothing is causing the ball to fall. Though that's again misleading.

	<TEXT> Perhaps he was confusing gravity and acceleration. 
For instance suppose you were in a box and that the box is accelerating upwards at ten meters per second squared, with you in it. Now if you were to drop the ball in this box, the ball would seem to accelerate downwards from your point of view at 10 m/s^2. In fact you could conclude that there is a downwards force acting on the ball. This force would behave in exactly the same way as gravity: no matter what you do you will never be able to determine whether there is gravity, or whether you are in an accelerating box. This is called the general principle of relativity, and is what led to Einstein's unsurprisingly named general theory of relativity. 

In this sense, the ball could "fall" in the "absence of everything". Of course, this not an absence of everything, because there is something causing the box to accelerate. When you are in the box you wouldn't know that the box is accelerating, so you could say that there is "nothing" that caused the ball to fall in this sense. It's convoluted though, and very misleading to say that.  </TEXT>

I do the same as well, though I know I can focus on the ideal only because somebody else focuses on the non-ideal. That's just what physicists do: they take the easy, ideal and interesting situations and whatever is non-ideal is engineering or chemistry or whatnot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends. Do you want to punish them or do you want to get rid of them? Punishing them is one thing, and is morally very hard to justify. Sure you could punish them here, and say that there is a reason. But who is to decide the reason? And where does this reason stop? Torture is a punishment worse than death, and accomplishes little more than that, because in the end all it does is get rid of them, with torture on the side. And torture is very dangerous for the torturer's mind.

Death accomplishes the same result but with less of the mental burden of torture. Of course you might say that justice hasn't been served, and it is true that death is not a sufficient payment for the crime, but then again, are we aiming to make them pay, or are we aiming to stop them?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Raditz is a Saiyan, and is meant to fight. If he doesn't he loses a lot of his character. He essentially becomes a Chaozu if he cannot fight.

Even as a brother he has no worth. Neither Goku or Raditz had fraternal feelings: Goku literally doesn't care or acknowledge him as a brother, and Raditz hates Goku, more than ever now that Goku has surpassed Raditz, killed Freeza, defeated Vegeta and has not only become a super saiyan, but has surpassed it. At this point in-universe, the existence of Raditz is so pointless that I'm pretty sure only Piccolo remembers him, and that's because Piccolo barely forgets with Kami.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello.
First of all I want to apologise if this is not the right sub. If it isn't could someone direct me to a more appropriate one? Thanks.

I remember reading some joke, in the form of panels  somewhere online some 6 years back or so and I cannot find any trace of it despite arduous searching. I cannot remember where I saw it if my life depended on it. 

I can't really remember the joke extremely well, so some details might be off, but I do remember the gist of it. 

Some guy has an appointment and the doctor phones him. He swears at the doctor, and the doctor reprimands him for being unprofessional and puts the phone down. The doctor calls and the guy comes up with an excuse. He starts: my car is not working.
 -That's ok. The hospital is just a few blocks across. You can walk.
-My leg is broken
-Take a taxi
-I'm broke
-I'll take you there myself.
-My mum died
-I thought she died last week
-My dad died
-How will you go to the funeral?
-I'll walk
-Your leg is broken
-I'll drive
-Your car was stolen
-I'll take a taxi
-You're broke!
- ...My mum died.

At which point the doctor is so exasperated he swears at the guy. The guy retorts that that's unprofessional and puts the phone down. 

The joke was something like that - details are a bit fuzzy. 
Anybody came across this?
Thanks for helping. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they are doing really risque stuff. 
Raditz coming back would serve nothing. Literally no one in the series liked him, not even other Saiyans, and he is really, really weak by their standards. And he was a one-off, that they probably don't even remember. Broly and Gogeta never existed in-series, though there is a character based on Broly and Gogeta might make an appearance. None of them save Vegeta really knew Bardock and nobody in-series really cared about him. 

Super literally created a new villain. And the villain's name is Goku. That's really risque. It shows how for all these years when Goku fought evil, it was always his selfish desires that pushed him to do so. For the first time since the beginning of the series, the Z-fighters are the villain. 

It's a beautiful return to his childhood ways. When Goku was a kid he would ruthlessly kill people. After he trained with God he stopped, shown when he refused to kill Freeza. But now he basically condemned entire universes. Makes you wonder whether he spared Freeza because he believed in second chances, or because he wanted to fight Freeza again. Goku is easily one of the most selfish people in the world. 

All these years he protected the universe, he did so just so that his friends could live, or so that he could fight again. The only two selfless things he did in the entire series was to teleport Cell away and to save Mr. Satan and Dende from Buu. In the android saga, Krillin once said that it was good that the androids were coming, because then Vegeta wouldn't go rogue on them. And the tournament arc pretty much shows that Goku goes rogue without enemies; who would have thought that this applied to him as well? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well, I believe that yes, they do. Beards and Moustaches are similar to pubes, so if these transform, I would suppose that pubes do as well. 

While no Saiyan has ever transformed on screen with a moustache, a human has. A human so legendary that his name itself has come to mean strength. A human so pure that he can bear the devil's name without taint. A human so badass that even aliens run at the mention of his name. A human so egocentric that he prompted the revision of Newton's gravity to Einstein's: Ladies and Gentlemen, please drumroll for the great human who is the only human to have turned into a super something god: Mr. Satan.

ok granted, it was only in one of his fantasy lies to the media, but for a brief second we did get to see the glory of Super Saiyan God Mr Satan, and his facial hair transformed, suggesting that his pubes did too. 

However, chest hair could also be considered as pubes, and these did not transform, so perhaps pubes don't change colour after all. It's hard to tell. 

Also, according to TFS, Vegeta's (deepen voice)Moustache(natural voice) transformed, so there's that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can answer a few of the questions, though I don't any fanfic.
The first question can be answered, but only if you ignore anime filler and stick to manga material only. Anime filler, especially in Z and by extension GT, basically ignores everything in Dragon Ball. 

Basically, what we saw destroying the moon was a kamehameha from Muten Roshi. Now consider this: the moon is 50 times smaller than earth, and 80 times lighter. Based on this, it isn't that hard to blow it up. After the moon was destroyed for the first time, only Goku's, Piccolo's (Sr and Jr), Tien's, Krillin's, Raditz's and Nappa's blasts hit the Earth. Kid Goku didn't even hit the Earth at all post lunar destruction, except with a really weak kamehameha. 

Piccolo Sr did hit the Earth multiple times with his blasts, but when he did, he destroyed a city easily (Makosen) and did not want to scar his kingdom. He did hit it at full power with the Exloding Demon Wave, and it basically blew up the King's castle and the surroundings, doing about as much damage as you would expect it to do. It could destroy the moon, but the blast would be a lot weaker on Earth, with its harder minerals, more closely packed matter and whatnot. 

Krillin hit the planet with his destructo-disc, which cut a mountain.

Tien's first kikohoh did about the damage you'd expect when restrained: he blew up a hole in the ground the size of the ring. The second time he used it was just to make a small hole anyway. 

Goku barely hit the Earth again as a teen. Piccolo Jr hit the Earth multiple times, and basically reduced the entire tournament stadium to dust, again what you could expect from rock (moon) vs concrete(Earth). Raditz did not score a direct hit on Earth, as his blasts were blocked by Goku's body and Piccolo's arm.

At this point, Piccolo destroying the moon is not even a feat of strength. 
Nappa really did a number on Earth. He blew up the wastelands and a city. And he held back. A lot. 

From this point on, if you notice, most of the stronger blasts were directed in the water where the magnitude of the explosion is not important because water doesn't get damaged, sent straight in the air, where a massive explosion follows, or their brunt is blocked by a body. This is why stronger blasts don't actually cause huge explosions. The only exception to this is when they fought Buu, but the Kai's planet is a lot sturdier than Earth, as stated by the Elder Kai. 

I'm not too sure what the second question means, but I'll assume you want a list of when techniques were used outside of battle. 

The poster child is flying of course. It's been used countless times to move faster out of battle. Instant transmission is second. Ki blasts have been used to light fires occasionally or to blow stuff up. Gohan lighting a log as a kid and Vegeta blowing up Gero's lab door comes to mind. Muten Roshi also used hypnosis once to turn a wolf-man into his man form after he blew up the moon. Though not really a technique, Trunks and Goten abused Super Saiyan to travel faster, and Piccolo occasionally stretched or regenerated limbs out of battle. Solar flare was used out of battle to escape Dodoria, though I don't know if this counts as out of battle. Ki sensing is very frequently used.
