	<TEXT> I totally understand they live there. But I don't get to pick and choose what job I want to do that day. If the project manager says "hey TxDOT is getting a lot of complaints about spur 527 I need you to get your guys and fix the problem." That's what I have to do. If he says "hey 610 north loop has some down exit signs go repair/replace them." Then that's what I have to do. 

Edit:  I'm not there by choice is what I'm trying to say. Im learning to keep my post and comment short and to the point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I didn't get them in that mess. I have my own problems to worry about. I understand the ones with mental issues but when you used to go with a church and  TRY to provide them shelter and food and they deny help and they  deny viciously then what do you want me to act/feel? I know tons of programs and resources for them but to no avail. 80% to 90% of them want to beg for money to get high and that's the bottom line. Do you know how many times I heard " I make over $100 a day flying a sign" They could move around with that. They get people like you that feel sorry for them and when you leave they laugh at you. Plus I never once mentioned trying to solve the problem. That'll never happen. Can't help someone that doesn't want to help themselves. Just let me do my job and make an honest living so I can feed and protect my family. 

Edit:  Don't think you are doing them any favors by being an enabler.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So the homeless problem is here to stay </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-31 14:48:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I work for the state doing highway maintenance. I do all kinds of things like graffiti, damaged guardrail, damaged highway signs etc... So I maintain the 610 loop and every highway inside of it besides 45. One of the things we do is shoo the homeless away and pick up all of their mess. If you've been by Wheeler Station lately you'll see that one popular place is fenced now and cleaned. Your welcome. So obviously we need police presence to do our job safe and it was never a problem to get them to aid us until recently. With this new police chief in town he has put a stop for letting cops be present while we work. The state won't let us work without them and we are the only company that's allowed to move the homeless and clean up after them. Which is really disgusting. So if you guys want to see less homeless and feel safe and clean please contact HPD or city hall and voice your concerns. Until the chief changes his mind the homeless are there to stay. 

Edit:  Don't read my last sentence. Replace with this
 --There will always be homeless around but we need law enforcement to help us out just a little to try and make our city look better. 

TL;DR Homeless are not going to be moved or their areas will not be cleaned up until the new chief allows his officers to be present like they always were. Bureaucracy at its finest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work for the state doing highway maintenance. So moving the homeless off from the highway is one of our work orders. But we need police presence to do so because we don't get paid enough to get stabbed. Also it something we didn't really sign up for. But when the HPD new police chief came into power he won't send us any cops to get the homeless up and away so we can do our job. I was actually there on Thursday and we got to clean up what we could. So it looks like the homeless are going to stay until TxDOT and HPD can figure something out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the wife and I are not new to vaping by any means. We just wanted to see the consensus of people's opinion on what could possibly be happening. So we get our juice from Mitten Vapors mainly because it's delicious and claims no sweeteners are added . We've recently got new setups and we are noticing that after a day or two of vaping we are getting the brown streams from the coils. The liquid we use is clear. We have had this problem with other juice companies but never Mitten. Can someone elaborate on what could possibly be going on. Thanks in advance. 

Edit: Merry Christmas
