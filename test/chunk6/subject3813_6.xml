	<TITLE> Another clueless 20something interviewer </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I have an interview for the position of veterinary assistant...everyone there wears scrubs. This is my 2nd interview with them, I managed to scrounge a semi-acceptable dress and cardigan for the 1st, but have no idea what to wear for the 2nd. This (http://imgur.com/LeEST    and    http://imgur.com/Pmfcr) is what I came up with for the 2nd one. It's not particularly flattering, but does it work at all? Thank you gals and guys in advance!

edit: title should technically be interviewee. Sorry, my bad. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Third year college biology class: Exactly how to tell which of the progeny are recombinats in a dihybrid cross? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-09-27 20:58:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Given a cross of AaBb x aabb

Progeny:
45 are AB
12 are Ab
8 are aB
52 are ab


What exactly makes them a recombination? Ab and aB are the recombinates according to the answer key, but why isn't AB? Other than the fact that recombination frequency maxs out at 50%.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Cracked, peeling feet? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-09-26 16:23:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The soles of my feet are thick and dry, cracking and peeling. My damn skin comes off in thick sheets. I've tried creams, vasaline, weird callus shavers, but nothing really works and it's always back within a few days. It's really rather ugly and sometimes the sticking out skin gets caught on socks...What to do? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance! </TEXT>
