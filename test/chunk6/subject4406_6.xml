	<TEXT> No, we were already moving out of our spot when he came out to start yelling. But to give you context, here is an image from google maps, where someone is parked similar to how we were. We were even closer to the front than this car. http://imgur.com/a/Fw6cb </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We had just got in our car to drive and some huge crazy guy came and started yelling at us that we parked in his driveway (we didn't). My partner got out to talk to him Calmy to show him we weren't in his driveway and he got up in her face and started spitting at her and calling us dykes and generally trying to intimidate us. Is this even legal? Any witnesses if go to the police? He seriously looked like he was about to go mental on my partner and our car.

Edit: I have partial video because I was a bit shocked and only started recording towards the end.

Edit 2: Here is the audio from our dash cam: https://youtu.be/cpLicizayX4 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dear mfbridges,

Nah, I'm from Australia. John Boston was just a name I came up with while drinking a John Boston beer. But if you're offering me a chance at a job, I'll totally move to Boston. I'll leave the spiders and bring the beer for sure.

Love,

	<TEXT> Yes, this is why we didn't go with that builder.

The drawings are fine, they are exactly what we want. What I mean by bundled services is things like Sydney water to check the pipes (we organised that and its all good), getting a engineer, surveyor and the stuff through the council. We did all of that, and its all good.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We did ask our architect for recommendations for builders, but they only gave us one who was available, and we didn't really like their work. To be honest, they seemed a little bit dodgy, as they weren't licensed, so we passed on that.

My partner is a Project manager in construction, so she knows what she's doing. However all her contacts are in commercial construction, not in residential, so we can't really use them.

Maybe we did make a mistake in not going with those companies that do a drawing/building combo, they seemed very expensive. But they had bundled services we didn't need, so it seemed like a waste.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can anyone recommend a builder for a medium sized house extension? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-17 03:06:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My partner and I want to extend our house. We have already got the plans drawn up by an architect, we just need some builders to give us a few quotes. All the builders my partner has called said they won't do it with our own plans and we have to do get them redrawn with them (which we don't want to do). 

Can anyone recommend any builders/companies they have used to do an extension on a house? 

We are in south west Sydney. The extension is pretty much a rectangle added to the back of our house and its going to be a new kitchen, dining and lounge plus a deck.

Just looking for recommendations if anyone knows someone, and will go off the plans we have drawn with our architect.  </TEXT>

I'll take everyone's advice on bringing our own food. I think that's the only way to go about it. We're still socializing, but just eating something different.  </TEXT>
