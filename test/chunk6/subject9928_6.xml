	<TEXT> Absolutely. I'm usually going aiming for 10, a day, then end up at 15 to 20 (However, using couchsurfing/camping in the wild, I don't have to consider accomodation fees except for the occasional hostel, which should be 7 to 15 outside known hotspots and depending on the country, and occasionally much more). That way I'm still far away from a frugal life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are some fun things for you to do? Most of my typical recommendations would be fun for some 17 year olds, but perhaps totally not for you.

General tips: Go stay in one place for longer than a few days  some less visited random place even (For example, have a look at Rome, of course, then you could spend a week in Viterbo). Stay longer than you need to watch the palace and the cathedral and the national museum and the viewtower (to name the things that every city has). That way you'll get to know an actual country instead of just some tourist attractions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Clarification: It's not a statement I support wholly. I said "from the German point of view", not "in my opinion". This is a wide-spread reasoning here and of course it's faulty. On the other hand it's really not like France is just the concerned watchman, of course they're mostly protecting their own interests in safeguarding their economic ties to the former colonies (which, as almost any Afro-European relationship, is a rather one-sided one). Similarily Germany isn't in Afghanistan just for sightseeing and peacekeeping.

I'd say Germany has still better ways than applying force directly to Syria  of course you may disagree. Far more effective in my opinion would be to use leverage on the Saudis etc., drain the swamp, so to speak  alas, our government does neither. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never said that! I didn't mean that we never had colonies, or gave them up for moral reasons  But indeed, as you pointed out, we never faced the problems associated with independence, decolonisation etc.
As for the brief colonial period we had  exclusively before the first world war , its organisation was a bit different from the rest of the colonial powers. State influence and interest was low, the colonies were mainly managed by merchants. Even the colonial armies (the "Schutztruppen") were the equivalent of Blackwater: private mercenaries and police forces, headed by a few actual officers (with the exception of Namibia). Ties to the motherland were few, even economically. </TEXT>
