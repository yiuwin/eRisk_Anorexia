your literally a bean counter  most of the unis will be  providing the same experience it's not like you are looking to study engineering.


If you are after a better student lifestlye  (social clubs,atmosphere,weekend activtys.)  then ANU  is ur best choice.
If you want the city lifestyle go  UWS.

RMIT is pretty good as well but you will go broke trying to afford student accomodation.

The definition of assault is causing any bodily or emotianal harm.
one of the videos shows an "officer" pushing his head against the arm rest that's misuse of force.

Also  the dude on CNN from  the law society was saying police don't actually have the authority to remove you from a plane  as it's federal jurisdiction not city,if this is true then they had no legal authorty to interact with him.

	<TEXT> At some point
Some beancounter should of gone.
800 per passenger or more.
x 4.

vs  paying  and i just used the charter calculator.
1372 dollars to charter a  6 seater from ohare to lousiville.

Or i dunno chuck them on a  charterd car with a driver.
5 hour or so drive.
would of eassily been under 500 bucks to hire a driver to take them that far.

ive had a driver take me and 3 workers from a work site in victoria australia up to northern nsw that was over 7  hours   and it was about 600 bucks.

This just smacks home the fact of how fucking retarded managment really is in corporate america.
Also  i love how no one stood up for the guy,here  if u tried that shit u would have about 15 ppl blocking the exit as our national identity is based on  the ideals of the fair go for everyone.

The dude who was on that flight that was asked to move cause he could not sit next to a child  as he  might be deemed a pedophile.. cause hey u know  every man in existence is a violent pedo rapist murdering scum lord. 
even though he wasnt which caused emotional distress for the man  he got  a  settlement of over 150k. with no long lasting injurys.
This dude.
HOLY.
HOLY FUCK.
if this goes to trial  any jury  in the land.
is going to rape united  so hard so deep they are going to be walking bowlegged for months.
i mean just a quick factoring.
incidental damages to his body  he is looking at well over 300k just for that.
then the punitive damages alone could be MILLIONs.

 i mean a dude who had hot coffe spilled on him on a flight  got over 1.2 million  but they appealed and settled for 600k  but still.
GOD DAMN.
like im literally getting hard thinking about the amount of money they will be offering this guy.

not to mention there stock has dived over 600 million so far in 2 days haha.
and the cancellations that will now happen.
and this china shit.
United is fucked

FACE PALM.

this is just an institutional failure on united part.

some mid managment person should of said fuck it.
there going to be late to Louisville. not to mention CNN and the BBC are saying the workers had still 22 hours to be on shift plenty of time to get them alternative  travel
if a company with 22,000 workers. a  multi billion dollar a year company.

Can not operate at the loss of 4 workers.
Something.
somewhere is fucking broken very badly.
i mean  shit we have like 10 or so ppl a DAY call in sick here.
You don't see us fucking crying.

I was at some    vegany  cafe in canberrra last week and the dude at the counter was saying this.

Total mouth breather. was telling me  well. sugar and gluten and wheat are all toxic to the body so we don't use that as it causes death so are  protein rich foods like eggs and meat.
Im like you know the human body needs protein to live right...
NO!!! NO IT DOESN'T....
Right

Wheat will kill me will it? </TEXT>

YOU ARE BEING RECORDED.

Also isnt all flights   federal jurisdiction..

Okay i just googled it.
a plane on the tarmac is under the authority of  the TSA and the FBI and us federal enforcement agencys. not the local police there authority ends at the boarding gate apparantly.

Im actualy a bit let down in the lack of humanity of the passengers that no one stood up for the poor basterd.

here in australia we have the cardial   clause with carriers.

Qantas one of our biggest carriers and our flag carrier.

Qantas employe needs to get to melbour from syd.
qantas flights overbooked.
They just walk on over to virgin booking ask to chuck them on for free  if they can.
next time around virgin might need to send a worker on a qantas flight they just work it out.

Supply won't be blocked.

as we have a biased media.
Labor and the  greens would get killed by the PR spin that the govt would use to call the opposition economic terrorists.

So supply will pass.
As it should.
But they have no reason not to block every single bill the govt tacks on to fund it's budget commitments.

You want to pass a tax cut Nope.
you want to cut welfare Nope.

	<TEXT> they don't.
our family sells to the supplier who supplies the carrots  and  lettuce to coles.
Never once eaten an extra cost like that.

They do fuck over the farmers though.
the pressure them into a contract that prevents them from selling goods at local farmers market's or other suppliers even if they knocked back that harvest..

There is a local orange grower here   the ricardos  and they had to  just bulldoze 50 tone of crop into a hole cause there suppliers contract prevented them from selling to anyone except "coles"  even though they knocked back that 50 tones as it was irregularly shaped.

so fuck coles
fuck wollies </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As both the grattan ,KPMG. and even petter costello have openly said.

If we want to create growth the simplest, fairest easiest way to do that is to raise the tax free threshold again.
make it a flat 20  or even 25.
 that's a few K extra in taxes ppl don't lose and can go and chuck into the local economy.
the cost of raising it to a flat 20k from 18500 would be less than 100 mill to the budget that's nothing we spent that on fucking plumbing services to defence bases last year lol.
Also the churches.
It's 2017.
Not 1804.
A church is a company.
It provides a service to a customer so it should be taxed like any other

the right  of the govt needs to wake up to.
Poor ppl will spend every last cent they have. they don't just sit around all day smoking fags   and drinking.
any extra money we can keep into the sub 30k bracket will almost always land back into a local economy. 

That and efficieny of govt services.
the ATO/and tresuary just spend 3.5  million on ordering new tables and desk.
a local company in quenbayen offered to do it. would of employed 25 extra workers.
yet they  order the shit from china to save about 40 grand lol. that's just stupid. they would of seen more than 40k back into the economy   from those extra workers. </TEXT>
