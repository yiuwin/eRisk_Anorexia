	<TEXT> Well, it still doesn't eliminate the problem of evidence. The thing about multiverse theory is that it's really just an explanation that makes other theories make sense, plus it makes the math work out well. If there are other universes, and they don't interact with our own, there would be no way to collect data on them. It's a cool idea, but basically non-falsifiable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, you aren't wrong in that some people tend to dismiss the other traditions in their defense of celibate priesthood, but that doesn't mean there aren't good reasons to maintain a celibate priesthood in the Latin Rite. Celibacy, whether ordained or not, has always been considered a higher vocation from the beginning. St. Paul himself declared it to be such. There's a reason bishops still must be celibate in the Eastern Rites and Orthodox churches. I happen to know a seminarian for the Ukranian Rite, and he's a big fan of the celibate priesthood.

While I would accept a change in the discipline if it were given, I worry that this would cause some people who don't understand the difference between discipline and dogma or doctrine to try and push for changes that can't happen, like Catholic priestesses. At least in the U.S., people think in terms of political affiliations, and this would cause people to think that the "liberal side" is winning so all of their pet causes will be implemented soon. I also don't see much benefit in this change. There are few if any men holding back from priesthood because they can't get married. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We should provide health care to those who need it, but people shouldn't be forced to directly participate in acts they are against morally. If we're going to call ourselves a country with freedom of religion, in any case. I would say that contraception and abortion are not health care, and the Jehovah's Witness would say that blood transfusions are not. If we aren't going to respect people's rights to not commit acts aiding in these actions, we should stop pretending that we have freedom of religion and admit that we have a state-sponsored religion of secular humanism. I'm not strictly against the government providing health care to all people, but I disagree with popular notions as to what constitutes health care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I would be forcing my beliefs on him, by using the government to strong arm him into doing something against his beliefs. I would still be completely free to practice my religion in my own life, and not be forced to do anything against my beliefs. Employers don't owe employees health care, and the fact that health insurance has become bundled with employment has led to the current crisis we have. You can choose to work or to not work for an employer, and the terms of your contract need to be agreed upon by both parties. If slavery were legal, and the law dictated that you needed to provide runaway slave insurance for your employees, would you think this is a violation of your rights? I'd hope so. The only difference is that you think that slavery is immoral and that contraception and blood transfusions are moral. But you don't get to dictate what people do of it's against their religious beliefs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, you seem to be a utilitarian rather than someone who believes in virtue ethics, so it would seem insane to you. I don't see any rational basis for utilitarian ethics, however. Also, my employer would in no way be forcing any of his beliefs on me. I would not be required to do anything against my beliefs, and neither would he. That is how a free society would operate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disagreeing with something doesn't have any effect on its truth. Women are certainly often put in difficult situations because of pregnancy, but there are exactly zero cases where the deliberate killing of an innocent human being is permissible. If a madman had his finger on a switch that would blow up the world, and said he would flip it unless you killed an innocent person, it would still not be permissible. And zygotes, blastocysts, and fetuses are distinguishable from tumors because they are human organisms. The consciousness doesn't enter into it.

People are always going to do a lot of evil things. We still shouldn't encourage them, and should do our best to encourage virtue. I'm not a utilitarian, so the practical effects don't interest me too much. Virtue should be promoted, and vice discouraged, no matter the consequences. 

Nothing about not paying for certain types of insurance prevents a person from practicing their religion. If I were to work for a Jehovah's Witness, they would be perfectly within their rights to only offer insurance that doesn't allow for blood transfusions. If I require surgery that needs a transfusion, I should be obligated to pay for it myself. I knew that going into the job. I choose to sign a contract, knowing what it entails. If I want different insurance, I'll work for a different employer or buy it myself. Also, in the mater of Catholic teaching, if hormonal birth control is used to treat an illness, it isn't birth control but rather medicine with the unfortunate side effect of disabling a healthy reproductive system. Intent matters. Of course, birth control is often prescribed to treat symptoms rather than underlying causes, and in many cases there are treatments that can address them more directly, but that's a different issue altogether. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm against abortion because murder is wrong, and humans are humans at every point in their development. Traits like consciousness, ability to survive outside the womb, and ability to feel pain are not essential for an organism to be human.

Contraception is wrong because sex is primarily for making children, and purposely frustrating that end is wrong. The pleasure from the act is only incidental to it, not the main point.

The AHA in its current form does not allow for enough religious exemptions, and tries to bully people into violating their religious beliefs simply because they own a company.

There, now you know other reasons why a person can hold those stances. Whether you understand them is out of my control. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The gist of this post seems to be: "I like the things that secular humanism and Christianity have in common, but not the things that are exclusive to Christianity." It sounds like your notion of morality is centered around a secular humanist mindset, which would preclude becoming a Catholic. I would suggest researching what the Catholic Church teaches and why, particularly why it is such an unparalleled evil to allow the wholesale slaughter of children to continue in the womb with full government approval.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the SNES American release, you definitely got to keep equipment. You didn't get to keep money. I remember quite clearly since I played that game through so many times. I would always go to the restored Medina Village and buy out everything before beating it, since they had the best prices. After that, I'd sell it all in New Game + to get money in my new game. The only thing you couldn't keep in New Game + was the Masamune, since it was a story item. So you needed to stick Frog with the Brave Sword until you do his endgame sidequest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Japan has at best a tenuous grasp of Catholicism. Kind of like Hollywood Buddhism. They seem to be trying here, but from what I see the "good" version of Catholicism that will be espoused will boil down to Secular Humanism with Jesus flavoring. Also....what kind of dating sim is it? Is it an eroge? If so then you shouldn't be recommending that anyone buy it at all.

EDIT: Looks like the Steam version is all-ages, but there is also an adult version. As much as it's commendable to research a setting properly, it's a porn game at its heart. Blasphemous to use Catholic teachings and symbols in this context. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, it's probably a combination of Divine Command morality and Total Depravity. When thinking about sin and modern people's resistance toward identifying anything as sin, I can sometimes get overly bitter and think things like "Your feelings on the issue are stupid and worthless. Whatever God says goes, and you have no right to say otherwise." Luckily I'm much more charitable when actually talking to people, and I know that the previous line of thinking is not in sync with Church teaching. I need to be wary of the line between Original Sin and Total Depravity to make sure I'm on the correct side.

So what sorts of heresies do you drift toward, if you aren't careful to guard yourself? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It can be rough. We're still considered a "Christian Nation" by census data, but it's clear from prevelant cultural attitudes, media representation, etc. that the dominant outlook is a secular humanist, utilitarian/consequentialist morality, with possibly some God flavoring as a nod to our past. Being against the Church's teachings is considered heroic and standing up to authority, while agreeing with the Church (where it would differ with the commonly held ethics) is seen as barbaric and outdated, as though truth had an expiration date.

Anecdotally, I recently posted on Facebook that I was surprised how many Catholics were going against Church teaching by supporting the Supreme Court's ruling on same sex relationships. Within hours, several people I hadn't talked to in years, who weren't gay nor Catholic, were on there lambasting me for not being fully supportive of the decision, and basically dictating how the Church should change with the times, or dragging out things I've done in the past as proof of how I'd be a hypocrite for ever telling anyone that anything is wrong. No consideration was even given to the possibility that 99% of human civilization had a reason for giving special privileges to male/female binary relationships. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Notice the language being used. Talk about "love is love", the "right to love", "equal rights", etc. Not a single mention of what marriage is actually about. SCOTUS didn't redefine marriage last Friday - that was done by popular culture a long time ago. Around a hundred years ago, in fact. Once marriage became about validating the feelings ("love") between consenting parties, this was the logical path for it to take. Marriage as such no longer exists in the eyes of the general population and has been replaced instead by this bizarre and ultimately useless thing that bears the same name in modern society. Once marriage was redefined that way, it was only a matter of time before it was extended to same-sex couples. Without a coherent definition of marriage dependent on the complementarity of the sexes, there was no reason to deny it to same-sex couples except prejudice. Which can be educated away by normalization in culture. We've already seen it, and it will continue. Shows will be falling over themselves to show diverse enough relationships by including gay relationships. Many already do.

If anything, the major shift with this ruling will be mentality toward opposition. People stuck in the myth of the cult of progress will now see themselves validated as on "the right side of history" and dismiss anyone who disagrees as a mindless bigot. Note how the kids responded when asked if they knew anyone against the ruling - they couldn't even conceive of a possible reason why anyone would be against it, except "religion" - which as we all know just means blind obedience with no thought behind it, right?

The actual implementation of the institution didn't change overnight, but the idea of what marriage is about changed long ago, and we've only recently been seeing the full effects of that change. Expect more. Marriage as it has been understood in past cultures bears no resemblance to this new thing sharing its name, which will only serve to muddy the waters when studying history. They should have thought of a new word when they changed the definition, but it seems too late for that. We'll see where this goes. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have two relatives who are going to their first con in a week and a half (I told them they should have started this sooner but school, sports, and plays interfered), and they really want to cosplay. Neither has the money to shell out for elaborate outfits or props. They are mildly crafty and could probably make props with passable quality if they had an idea. I figure with so little time left and little money, they should pick characters that dress relatively normally, with clothes you could find in a thrift shop. I only have minimal cosplay experience myself, so I thought I could ask some experts in the field.

They are girls, ages 14 and 15, and have roughly the same build (very thin, average height, longish hair). Their interests include:

Kingdom Hearts (they originally wanted to do Axel and Roxas but leather trenchcoats are expensive)

Hetalia

RWBY

The Ace Attorney series

Ouran High School Host Club

Death Note

Tokyo Mew Mew

Any anime with pretty boys in it

Once Upon A Time

Tales of the Abyss

Disney Movies

Probably other stuff I don't remember in the same vein as above

So any ideas on quick and dirty cosplay they can throw together for their first outing and look good? Any help or advice is appreciated. </TEXT>
