	<TITLE> Problems with Iron Fist </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-20 16:10:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First, let me say that after watching all 13 episodes I think it was better than Jessica Jones but not as good as Daredevil.  It was on par with Luke Cage.  It was okay.

But it could have been better.  The biggest problem for me was the lack of positive male characters (other than Danny): Harold Meacham was evil, Ward Meacham was a little shit, Davos was an asshole, Bakuto was evil and Kyle was a wimp.  

[I will, as far as I know, be the first to wonder out loud if Harold and Kyle were supposed to be a gay couple.  Kyle was there after midnight.  He presumably didn't go home.  And the scene with the ice cream was just weird.]

Another problem was race.  Yes, race.  They could have easily made Danny biracial.  They wouldn't have even had to cast a different actor: they could have just hired a Chinese actress to play his mother.  Finn could have pulled it off: he was playing someone who had a foot in two different cultures as it was.

It actually would have made a lot more sense if Heather Rand had been Chinese.  I mean, she was the one who introduced Madame Gao to Rand Corporation.  How did that happen?  I don't think we got the whole story.  Did she know that Madane Gao was exporting drugs?  If Heather Rand had been Chinese it would have been a bit more plausible.

Another problem was Danny's Mandarin.  It actually sounded pretty good, but I have to wonder why he didn't use more of it, say with Madame Gao or Davos or with people in China.  I realize that people don't want to read subtitles but a fair compromise would have had him going back and forth between English and Mandarin.  If Danny and Davos were fluent in both then that's exactly how you would expect them to communicate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Better yet, Barry went down a slippery slope when he had Eobard kill his mom.  So if Iris is dead in the future doesn't Barry have to go back in time and make sure Iris dies?  The problem with that theory is that Iris wasn't dead pre-Flashpoint.  From original Barry's point of view, Iris isn't meant to die.  So this would be an alternative future version of Barry that has already come to accept Iris' death.  This strongly suggests that Barry is preventing the future that Savitar has already come to accept.  From Savitar's point of view, this makes Barry the villain.  Savitar literally ceases to exist when Barry saves Iris. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still compare it to my situation here.  When I first arrived in Taiwan, my Chinese wasn't that good and I would ask people if they could speak English.  Now I don't bother.  And, yes, I have spoken to Vietnamese, Japanese and Filipino people, respectively, in Chinese.  Did I assume they could speak Chinese?  Yes.  Was I being racist?  No, because even if I had known that these people weren't Chinese (which I didn't) you would think they they, living in Taiwan, would be able to speak the local language.  Now, Danny sees Colleen and he first speaks to her in English so he's making the same assumption, namely that she speaks the local language.  It is only later that he tries speaking Chinese with her.

That's really not so bad.  Some foreigners who have lived in Taiwan a long time get really upset when people speak to them in English but, really, why would they think we can speak Chinese?  A lot of foreigners arrive fresh off the plane and don't speak a word of Chinese.  I actually appreciate people taking the effort to speak to me in English.  It's not as if it is easy for them to learn.  And if my Chinese is better than their English then I'll let them know.  It's no big deal.  Some people are just way too hung up on race and think that everybody is insulting them when they are actually being friendly. 

Seriously, you may think "What the fuck?  Why is he speaking to her in Mandarin?" when I was thinking the opposite: why was he speaking to Madame Gao and Davos in English when people in K'un L'un clearly could speak Mandarin?  (I am assuming that Danny learned Mandarin in K'un L'un.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People can talk shit about Daredevil Season 2 but I don't think I am doing that.  There were rumors when Daredevil Season 2 came out that they might not do Iron Fist.  I actually liked Daredevil Season 2 better than Iron Fist but I think Iron Fist had its moments.  I think the Netflix series as a whole have better villains than the movies because there is more time spent with them.  The movies treat villains like the moles in wack-a-mole: they pop up and are knocked down by the time the movie is over.  The villains on the Netflix series have been more menacing.  Well, except maybe the Russians and the Irish in Daredevil Seasons 1 and 2, respectively: they only existed to have their heads smashed in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They were originally going to have four series plus the Defenders.  What would it have looked like?

When Daredevil Season 2 was announced suddenly Iron Fist was thrown into doubt.  I think they were originally going to introduce Elektra as an antagonist in Iron Fist.  She was going to be a member of the Hand.  We would learn of her connection to Daredevil in the Defenders.  I think the problems with Iron Fist stem from them not quite having enough story for thirteen episodes.  I think the series turned out okay.  It wasn't terrible. </TEXT>

In this case, Danny could speak English and Mandarin and he was letting her know that Mandarin was an option. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Extending the Avengers / Defenders analogy </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-19 10:26:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So people have pointed out the way Iron Fist has been promoted as the LAST Defender and how this is analogous to Captain America being the FIRST Avenger.  There's also, the order in which the movies / shows came out to consider:

Iron Man - Daredevil

Hulk - Jessica Jones

Iron Man 2 - Daredevil 2

Thor - Luke Cage

Captain America - Iron Fist

Basically, Daredevil is like Iron Man as he is the most well known of the Defenders characters, not only to the general public but to comics readers as well because there was actually a long period of time after the cancellation of Power Man / Iron Fist was missing and presumed dead.  Daredevil is also like Iron Man because he wears a full face mask.  Well, actually, his mask is actually more like Captain America's because it does show his chin but Captain America rarely wore a mask in his movies and his identity was publicly known anyway.

To say Jessica Jones is like the Hulk is a bit of a stretch but she is, probably, the strongest of the main four Defenders.  She also has anger issues as a result of PTSD.  Oh, sure, Tony Stark suffered from PTSD in Iron Man 3 but it's not as if he had been repeatedly raped for weeks.

Again, to say that Luke Cage is like Thor is a stretch but Thor is immortal.  Presumably a Judas bullet would hurt Thor in the same way that it would hurt Luke Cage.  As Loki says "Humans think us immortal.  Shall we test that?"

Iron Fist, meanwhile, while not actually frozen for years did come back to civilization years later after being considered dead after his plane crashed in the snow and ice.  Like Steve Rogers, Danny Rand would have a lot of catching up to do: he wouldn't know who Rihanna or Lady Gaga were and he would have missed most of the X-Men movies.  He should make a list of things to catch up on.

Eleltra was introduced in Daredevil Season 2 so that makes her similar to the Black Widow who was introduced in Iron Man 2.  She also has "red in her ledger" because she was an assassin working for the chaste before she even met Matt Murdock.  Elektra is also going to be similar to Hawkeye because presumably she will be an antagonist for the first few episodes of the series and will "feel better" once she "put[s] a sai in Alexandra's eye".  

Colleen Wing is also like the Black Widow and Hawkeye.  First, she's female and a martial artist so automatically she is more like the Black Widow than Hawkeye but the Black Widow only uses guns and he "widow's bite" as weapons so both Colleen Wing and Elektra are like Hawkeye because they all stab people with pointy weapons.

Trish and Misty are like Agents Phil Coulson and Maria Hill.  Why?  Well, because frankly they've been more like sidekicks than protagonists so far and, besides, if Misty loses her arm and gets it replaced with a bionic one then to people who don't read the comics she will seem a lot like Coulson.

Finally, Claire Temple is like Nick Fury, first of all because Claire Temple is played by Rosario Dawson and Nick Fury is played by Samuel L Jackson and they are both big name stars that Marvel able to score.  Also, Claire Temple has been in every single one of the Marvel Netflix series and Nick Fury was in most of the Phase One Marvel movies (including mid and end credits scenes).

	<TEXT> I'm watching episode 4 and I am finding it really tedious.  I thought the first three episodes were okay but there just aren't any pay offs.  Ward Meacham is trying to kill Danny Rand but after Joy drugs him he just goes to a mental hospital.  Danny wants to be released from a mental hospital but ultimately all he has to do is knock down the door.  Danny tries to get his company back and then all he has to do is ask Harold Meacham.  Time after time plot threads are ended unclimactically and, as a result, people get the feeling that the plot hasn't progressed after three episodes.   

EDIT: Episode 7 is much better than Episode 6.  Again, you have to ask why Gao doesn't simply have Danny killed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was Zoom after him for using his speed or was Zoom after him because he was time travelling?

Actually, it begs the question why the time wraiths were not after Eobard in Season 1.  We found out about the time wraiths when Barry went back in time in Season 2 when Barry went back in time.  We don't know how Eobard managed to hide from the time wraiths for 15 years but presumamably it is because he didn't have his speed for most of that time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But we also know that Zoom would not be able to find him if he didn't use his speed.

"Now what they should have done was end this season of Legends with him stranded back when he killed Barry's mother, with his memory gone and his speed gone."

That's what we thought they were going to do but that's not what they ended up doing apparently. </TEXT>

No, he didn't say that.  He was much more vague about it.  We assumed that he has been on the run immediately after Flashpoint but obviously we were wrong.

In present day, Caitlin and Cisco still remember Wellsobard.  They wouldn't remember him if Eobard hadn't become Wellsobard.

"why did Eobard lose his speed when he stranded the first time, but not the second time?"

Exactly, he would have lost his speed again and would have had to become Wellsobard again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, yeah, if Reverse Flash kills Barry's mom then he is back to square one.  Basically, he had to kill Barry's mom because this version of Barry Allen was never going to become the Flash and that meant that he would lose his own speed when Barry lost his.  But when he kills Barry's mom then he will lose his own speed anyway and have to become Wellsobard all over again.  Except this time he knows his plan ultimately didn't work.  Or did it?  Presumably Eddie kills himself again but instead of disappearing Wellsobard runs away and stays ahead of the Black Flash who would have destroyed him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The strongest evidence for SHIELD returning is the fact that the Inhumans series is only eight episodes.  That leaves room in the schedule for Agents of SHIELD Season 5 to have about 14 episodes.

Then we'll see.  A lot depends on ratings.  There are many different scenarios.

1) Inhumans is a disappointment.  People don't stick around for Agents of SHIELD Season 5.  Both series are cancelled.

2) Inhumans is a disappointment but word of mouth causes people to watch Agents of SHIELD Season 5 and it gets renewed for Season 6.

3) Inhumans is a big success and it justifies the expense of filming in Hawaii.  It is renewed for another season and Agents of SHIELD is cancelled.

4) Inhumans is a success but it is expensive to produce.  It gets renewed for another eight episodes.  This is good news for the cast of Agents of SHIELD because ABC will want a show to fill that time slot when they aren't showing Inhumans.

5) Marvel is being coy about renewing Agents of SHIELD because they are developing a movie in Phase 4 that will introduce the characters from Agents of SHIELD to people who don't watch the TV show, say for example a movie in which the Black Widow steps up to become Director of SHIELD.  This would make a full season renewal unlikely because the actors would need to take a few months to film with Scarlet Johansson. </TEXT>
