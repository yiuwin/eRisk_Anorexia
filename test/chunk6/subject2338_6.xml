	<TEXT> No,you're right.
I have a weird anxiety thing about drinking liquids,so I limit my ability to drink to certain times in the day,but obviously that's likely the cause of my discomfort. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> INSANE cramps when I run. Is running out of the question for me? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Alrighty,so I've evaluated the likely causes of my cramps,and I think it's likely a result of dehydration. I don't drink much throughout the day,but I find that if I drink anything before I run,I get cramps and discomfort from the swishing around and the feeling of having anything in my stomach.

The other day I went out for a run,without having eaten or drank anything for the day,and I literally couldn't run more than half a mile. The cramps were INSANE,and I just couldn't continue running. I love running,but I can't seem to find a way to run without getting awful,insane cramps that just don't let up. Is there any solution for me,or should I stick to other forms of cardio? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good point.
I'd much rather just bust these classes out,and get a full ride in the fall. I doubt that I'd be able to make enough money over the summer to cover the costs,and I really don't want to lose my funding! I can handle a few months of tough classes,rather than work all summer and school year. I can suck it up for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's true! I'll be living on campus,and only working nights at a bar,so I should have my full days to devote to class. 
My friends are all going home for the summer,so i won't have too many distractions either.
I just hope that i'm not hating life too much:/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went into college with the EXACT same thoughts/situation. My whole family is alcoholics,abuse drugs and basically just become addicted to anything they try.
So I went into college not planning on drinking,partying or anything like that,but then I decided that whether or not I over drink is MY choice. If I can control myself and still go out and have fun,then I'm gonna do it.
I go out,go to parties,drink very limited amounts and still have a good time. The only drugs I take is aderall,on extremely rare occasions,but besides that I don't do any drugs,including pot. My first semester,I was uptight,rigid to a fault,and ended up having a mental breakdown,and needing to leave college for awhile.
I returned,chilled the fuck out,still maintained some rigidity and discipline,and now I can have fun,keep my high GPA and not be anxious or overly uptight.
To each their own though.
