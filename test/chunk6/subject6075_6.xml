	<TEXT> So I dated a guy who turned out to be a huge whiny bitch once I really got to know him. He was clingy and a real loser with no goals or ambitions, but I had liked him for a long time before we dated because he was funny. He also had abandonment issues from his meth addicted mom leaving him at a young age, so I was patient. Anyway I broke up with him after 3 months of misery and it got out of control quick. 

He wanted to go on one last walk through the woods along  the bayou and I was just trying to get it over with, he knew we were over though and was trying to change my mind. I absolutely hated him at this point and was stoned faced the whole time. I tell him we are done for good and he snatches my car keys and try's to throw them into the river. Btw I am 17 with no license at the time, and he's saying he's going to the local police station to tell them I'm driving W/O a license. I was trying to join the military at the time and didn't want anything on my record.

This is when things escalated. I lose my shit cause well, I hated him and I start shoving him trying to make him fall so I can snatch my keys but he fights back and at one point I bit him and grabbed him by the neck. He eventually stops screams and cries, throws my keys back to me and storms off, grabs a huge tree branch and BREAKS IT OVER HIS HEAD. The he goes up to a thorny tree and bangs his head repeatedly until he falls down.

I just leave and he starts screaming my name and catches up to be gets the keys back and and is all giddy and is seriously creeping me out. I realize I'll have to go about this in a different way and try to manipulate him into thinking I might still like him. This last for a good hour until I got him laying in my lap, his eye are closed and his hand with the keys are right there, so I quickly grab'em and dart for the trail out, get to my car and left him. I'm not proud of any of that. It was my first relationship and I had anger issues if my own 

He still tried to get back together days later.  </TEXT>
