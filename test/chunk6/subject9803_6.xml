	<TEXT> Well... if by failure you mean she's raised over half her funds in less than half her allotted time, and is well on her way to reaching her goal, then yah your correct, this is a failure :/ 

And IMO, i think there are essentially 2 ways of looking at Kickstarter

1) looking at it as a store front. this train of thought is basically, "I want to sell my product for $X, so instead of selling it myself, i'll put it on kickstarter for $X which will increase my potential customer base." So the Customer gets the product for the "normal" cost, and the supplier gets the sale at the "normal" cost minus about 10% (kickstarter fees)

2) Looking at it as a way to donating money to someone you like/ believe in to achieve something that would otherwise be financially unattainable, and you can receive a gift as a tiered pledge. I honestly think this is the way kickstarter should be used. The pledges shouldn't be seen as a "i'm just going to pick this item up and check out" it should be seen as using your wallet to say "I believe in you." and the gift is seen as a "thanks for believing in me."  if its merely a commerce platform, just make a site and sell your shit thru etsy, or whatever. I mean its a crowdfunding service, its all about fundraising, do you go a charity banquet and complain that the meal didn't really cost $25 to make, no because the money is going toward a cause you believe in. if you don't care about the project don't back it simple as that. 

this is a FUNDRAISING platform..... you know to RAISE FUNDS. 

As for your outrage about lack of shipping prices. Since you see kickstarter as simply a store front lets look at the 30 Dollar Pledge.... you get a T shirt. Ok, so Its a hand made relief printed Tshirt, I sell the exact same thing in my shop for $25 bucks, You know how much i Typically pay in shipping fees and materials? about 5 bucks. know what that equals? about 30 bucks. all because she don't have shipping prices, doesn't mean she hasn't figured them in. Hoesntly the only issue i have with that is she screws herself over if she has any international orders... but you can turn international shipping off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> one of the most stressful videos i've ever seen on reddit was of that happening. It was a guy going up through a cave, its one of those tunnels that you have to control your breathing to get thru, kind of like this video, problem was, guy starts to panic since he can't get thru.... which makes it harder, to make things even worse, there was water that starts pooling around him, and if he doesn't calm down and control his breathing he'll drowned, haven't seen the video in a long time but i think the water got up to his chin/ mouth before he actually got out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So basically carve the board, paint over that use some slightly diluted acrylic paint. The paint shouldn't fill in the carved lines, rather it should coat them. Then after it's all painted, then you roll over it just like a normal relief print. 

As for shirts, drive by black by gamblin is what you should use. Google it and watch the video for the basic run down.  </TEXT>

So i just called it an wood engraving to avoid that. Guess I could call it a wood cut skateboard, but then non printmakers don't know what wood cuts are.... I just can't win.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean its all a matter of opinion whats better. This board the wood was naturally blue (as you can see when i carve it) but the finished board is all painted, even the blue, is a different shade than the wood. I think the a simple black layer on raw wood looks nice and clean almost rustic and olden, where as these color board seems more Pop-y and slightly more like a production board..... idk. its all a matter of taste. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, really like how the color turned out, only started using color about a year ago and glad i did. I mostly just sell prints when i do shows, this board i was just bored (no pun intended) while waiting from some kickstarter funding to come thru so i made this for fun/ to take to SGC with me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks, modified my original idea a couple times from the critiques that i got from my first couple boards (namely how not to put anything important where the trucks go) and trying to incorperate color, which i was worried about the whole time i was doing it, but it turned out quite well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks, appreciate it. those first 3 i did were nice and clean/ simple (relatively speaking). Originally wanted to do the same thing with this board using only the raw wood and black ink, but the board/ wood was blue, and it didn't look right so i had to paint it to make it work. and really happy how it turned out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not going to lie to you, this isn't too deep. In a nutshell been I often use birds as protagonist in my work, it got brought up that it seems like i use them self-referentially so the bird mask came out of that. as for the boobs..... well i just thought those were kinda fun/ interesting. and the legs, well first bird costume that came to mind was Big Bird, so those are based on Big Bird. thats pretty much it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On a positive note, it's going to get warmer in a couple days so it'll melt faster, also it might sound trivial, but it was 60 yesterday, so the ground will still be retaining some heat so not all the snow will stick right away.... Granted that'll probably mean more ice, So it's kinda a wash.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well I'm not technically a post grad, but pretty much fit the profile, If your talking drinking places, bar wise, I like Arcadium the best, its usually pretty chill, has good beer, and arcade games for 25cents a pop. After that the breweries are a pretty solid choice, in preference order: W6th, Ethereal, Blue Stallion, Country boy (this this tends to be the most college-y out of the bunch).
If your talking events/ outings just depends on what your into, check out Tadoo.com, it can be really hit or miss, but they have some pretty cool stuff on there occasionally, once the Night Market starts back up check that out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A "loyal" player leaving his team looking for the most money = selfish. 

A GM dropping/trading a "loyal" player to save money= just a business decision 

A player leaving a team to get on a better team= just trying to get a easy ring

A team dropping a seasoned player to make a better team= were the best team ever!
