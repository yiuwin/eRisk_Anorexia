	<TEXT> Xhakzorla works. We need to go with those two until Ramsey is back and proves that he's a better option than Santi. I hate when people say that Santi doesn't have the legs to play regularly anymore because that's absolutely false, and he's proving it. Hopefully he stays healthy.

On another note, kind of alarming how many chances we missed last night. This can't be a problem again this year. At the end of the day 3 points is all that matters, but that could have been 4-0 easily.

Overall I'm happy that Wenger is finally taking the CL seriously and as long as we don't draw one of Bayern and Atletico, we can make it through.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 3 Pros and 3 Cons From Today </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-26 02:25:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll start it off.

Pros
1. Cousins, proved the haters wrong with a solid performance
2. Hopkins was spot on today. Feels great to finally have a good kicker.
3. I thought the team as a whole showed a lot of passion today. They seemed like they wanted to win. Baker even got into an argument with Barry, I love to see players speak up. Su'a is insanely passionate, and I love that.

Cons
1. Run defense was horrible yet again. Our linebackers are virtually nonexistent on running plays.
2. Red Zone. Play calling MUST get better in the red zone. It's ridiculous.
3. There were a ton of injuries today. I'm concerned about depth, hopefully we address that during the week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Likes:

1. JOSH NORMAN. Easily the best player on the team. 
2. Defensive line and offensive line both looked much more solid in that game. Looked like they were actually trying. We got some penetration on defense and our pass protection was stellar.
3. Our WR's and TE's are fantastic.

Dislikes
1. Breeland...don't know what's wrong with him
2. Kirk. He's been really bad so far and he needs to get out of his head and throw the damn ball
3. Coaching. Barry is horrible, simple as that. We're too predictable on defense. As for offense, we didn't run the ball nearly enough. Jones was making a difference but he couldn't get the ball enough. McVay called some questionable plays in the red zone (those fade routes) which really fucked us because it was a waste of two plays. Kirk felt pressured to force a throw because we really needed it on that last play due to the waste of the first two downs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agree with the first part, but the second part...what?

Victor Cruz has played twice since returning from a two year injury, he's not a half step weaker, he's like 3. OBJ is far better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> God awful play calling on both sides of the field. 

We waste 2 downs trying at some ridiculous fade route that never works, then Kirk forces it into triple coverage. Obviously Kirk needs to do better, but if those plays weren't called, we would have scored. Just ridiculously dumb things.

On defense, we continued to match Breeland up against Dez. He was wide open coming across the middle of the field several times, so we should have someone dropping back in coverage. Also, it amazed me how many times they'd run a bootleg and a TE would be open. We finally figured that out, but it was way too late.

Kirk also needs to play better. Simple as that. Missing too many easy throws and making a lot of bad decisions. If he wants the big contract, he won't get it playing like this.

And most importantly, FUCK LICHT. It baffles me how you can false start as a center. AND IN THE LAST MINUTE ON A GAME WINNING DRIVE?!?! Fuck off man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How does him playing on one side of the field have anything to do with his talent level? The defensive coordinator puts him there, you act like he chooses to play on one side. He played quite well last week, especially when covering Brown. I see no hints of him regressing at the moment. </TEXT>
