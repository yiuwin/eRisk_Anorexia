	<TEXT> ...because you said red wine was the single worst thing to get drunk on and I strongly disagreed.   
  
Red wine is perhaps the greatest thing to get drunk on. It's cheap. It's served at room temperature. It gets you HAMMERED. There are a few downsides like the hangover, which is easily remedied if you actually remember to drink water when you drink red wine. 

But hey, if you've had your bad experience with red wine I completely understand. There are reasons I don't drink gin anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump really would build a new ballroom for the White House and use it constantly. Business friends would be wined and dined at the White House and spend the night there. Melania would wear a lot of very expensive dresses.   
   
 Hillary would get together with Congress to pass a bunch of tax loopholes for Wall Street. So Goldman Sachs can buy another Gulfstream V or three so their execs can fly to skiing parties in the Italian Alps. Because that's what America really needs: multimillionaires enjoying aprs-ski parties in $1,700 hotel rooms in Europe. 

So blatant wastes of money on both sides...I look forward to my new overlords

	<TEXT> I'm fairly new to Dallas too but I think its both sides wanting independence from one another. For people not living in around DFW, you imagine that Dallas and Fort Worth are on top of each other and must be (in essence) the same place. In reality, Ft. Worth can be over an hour drive from some areas of Dallas and it is in reality, a very different city (more Western at least)  
  
I don't think its a rift so much as people pointing out that Dallas and Fort Worth are more different than alike.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to get on that 4 x 10's schedule. I promise you those extra 2 hours a day are nothing. 12 hour days suck and you feel those but the additional 2 hours a day is totally worth an entire extra day off. I'd give it a serious reconsideration because I miss it so much...I had Sun/Mon/Tues off every week, wasn't great for doing a lot of social things but that extra day was amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see where you're coming from. I would agree that Clinton would continue on in a similar manner to Obama. I just don't really see your point on Trump spending less, the data shows pretty conclusively that the next President will spend more than the previous one regardless of what party they are in.   
And yes I see what you mean about Obamacare costs but one could argue that Obama's increase in spending was a result of 2 wars started under Bush and the bank bailouts, housing crisis, recession yada yada. Every president has to deal with the consequences of his predecessor. In Obama's case it was wars, the next president will have to deal with Obamacare.   
  
 I guess I see where you're coming from in regards to not wanting a president who will spend more but I think that you're assuming that Trump won't spend money based on him having no record of doing so in government...that's not something I would be so certain about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obama is by far the worst when it comes to spending...because he's the most recent. 8 Years ago you would've said the same thing about Bush. 8 years before that you'd say the same thing about Clinton...  
In 4-8 years we'll be saying the same thing about the next president. No offense, but I think your logic is wrong on this point.   
 
Can you provide some sort of basis for your conclusion that Trump will spend less than Clinton...I'm not sure why you think that it's a "very fair bet" that a guy known for lavish spending in his personal life would be any different in office. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> my biggest issue is spending. Obama doubled the debt, spending more than any president in history, and Clinton will likely only expand on this. Trump, while politically unknown, is less likely it seems to spend as much as Hillary surely will.  
  
I'm sorry but this argument really annoys me.[ Every president in recent history has increased spending and worsened our debt.](https://www.thebalance.com/us-debt-by-president-by-dollar-and-percent-3306296)     
Obama spent more than Bush, Bush spent more than Clinton, Clinton spent more than Bush...it goes on and on
  
If you think Trump is going to be any different you are mistaken. I'm not trying to comment on who you're voting for, I could care less, but if your biggest issue is spending then I wouldn't hold your breath for anything to change. I promise you no matter if it's Trump/Clinton/Stein/Asteroid...government spending will increase.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man, I'm probably too late but anyway  
  
[Every really wonder about the numbering system on US highways](https://betterexplained.com/articles/highway-math/)?   
  
  
Even numbers go East/West (I-90, I-10), and odd numbers go North/South (I-5, I-95). Think "Even" goes "East".

Numbers increase towards the Northeast. (Hey, NYC thinks it's the center of the world, right?) I-5 is on the West coast, I-95 on the East coast. I-10 must be in Texas, I-90 must be in Massachusetts.

Auxiliary interstates connect to the primary ones, and have 3 digits: 290 connects to 90, 495 connects to 95, etc.

Odd prefixes (190) connect once into the city from the interstate ("spur").
Even prefixes (495) typically loop around a city. (Being a man-made system, there are exceptions.)   
  
then it gets really crazy   
 
Once the main routes are numbered, smaller roads that connect them can follow this rule:

If you connect two routes, use their product. 3 * 11 = 33, so Route 33 connects Route 3 and 11.

If you loop back to the same route, just square it. 3 * 3 = 9, so Route 9 connects Route 3 to itself.

If you connect three roads, it could be Route 66 (connecting routes 2, 3 and 11). </TEXT>
