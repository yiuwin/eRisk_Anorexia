	<TEXT> Strangely enough this actually happened to me earlier today. I work at a convenience stores (Circle K) and during a fairly slower part of the day a man came in to purchase a poweraid and a banana. Little did I know his dick was fucking out, but by the time I actually realized what was happening I was too shocked to confront him about it. Utterly dick struck. Instead I hastily concluded the transaction and watch bewildered as he walked away. It's been awhile since I've laughed that hard.
