	<TEXT> I have paroxysmal tachycardia, but mine lasts a little longer than 30 seconds and freaks me out too bad to feel euphoric. I've been on countless heart monitors, had xrays, blood work, EKGs, and they can't figure it out either. But I'm being tested for further thyroid, autoimmune, metabolic, and adrenal disorders so my problem may lie there.
I'd suggest asking your GP to test your thyroid, adrenal function, etc. and if it becomes to bothersome, maybe talk to them about a beta-blocker to help with the attacks and pain. It's not something to rely on long-term, but it may help until you figure it out. Best of luck!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IANAD, but with a history of a heart condition, I'd say this warrants a trip to the ER or wherever to get checked out, since you're having chest pains. Don't worry whether you're going to bother your parents or not. They're your parents and if you're sick, you can't help it. Better to be safe than sorry. 
I know nothing about a temperature reading like that, though. 
I hope you feel better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone, 
In the next couple of weeks I will be undergoing tests for adrenal insufficiency/fatigue, metabolic disorders, and a few others I know plenty about. But I was wondering if anyone could give me some insight on what to expect from the Cort stim test.
I've done my reading on it but I'd like to know anyones experience in having it done. I'm incredibly anxious as is and would like to know what to expect. 
Thank you for your time!

Current meds: Omeperazole magnesium, propranolol, depo-provera shot, promethazine.
Existing conditions: Thyroid disoder, paroxysmal tachycardia, endometriosis, IBS, asthma. </TEXT>

But I'm glad it's working for you! It's so hard to find the right med a lot of the time and you end up getting burnt out on switching to this and that, then adding this to that and etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for your reply :) I've had one small psychotic break but its like...its inevitable. Whether it be five or ten, maybe twenty years from now, I know one day I'm truly going to snap and I just don't know what I'll do or how bad it will be. The lack of sleep thing makes sense, though. Usually when I pull that crap, I'm really manic and don't sleep for days and I just clean, organize, rearrange my house, buy shit I don't need, buy a bunch of food and make it but don't eat a single bite...then by the time I come down, I hit hard. I can't bring myself to get out of bed or eat, I don't shower or brush my hair or teeth for weeks at a time, I don't leave my house, and its just bad news. I eventually come out of it but damn, its a fucking roller coaster and each time becomes worse.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't want to walk around all zombified and emotionless. I'm underweight so that's what the Remeron is for, I guess it's an appetite stimulant so I can't complain about weight gain. But I've had horrible acne for years, nothing helps it so I just deal with it. I know those side effects are what bother people the most but I hate the grogginess and not feeling like I can concentrate or function. It freaks me out.
I am incredibly grateful for communities like these. Yeah we're all strangers, but shit, we're fighting the same battle. I still don't think someone can truly understand mental illness until they have experienced it themselves.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depakote made me gain weight like crazy and even more moody than I already was. I hated that shit. My dreams have always been vivid and violent, even while not medicated so I can't say it affected me in that regard. 
If it makes you feel weird or you can't handle it, talk to your pdoc :) There's so many other medications and sometimes you just have to find the one thats a perfect fit for you.  </TEXT>

It's just so hard to deal with when everything is thrown at you all at once and I worry too much about all of the 'what ifs' and never expect any good outcomes, so I'm working on that. But I'm just worried about all the new meds and how they're going to affect me. I've heard nothing but good things about Remeron but Lamictal and Abilify are a whole different story lol  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my first post here, so please bear with me.
I was diagnosed with bipolar I and anxiety disorder when I was 13, but I had been dealing with it for years before being diagnosed. I've had one hospital stay, after my second manic episode in which I ended up trying to hang myself, when I was 14. 
I had been on lithium and depakote when I was admitted and during my stay I was overdosed on lithium and became very ill, so I refused it from there on out. I was put on Trileptal and stayed on it until last year. I quit taking it after a nervous breakdown and health crisis and have been unmedicated since.
Fast forward to present day, I'm 23 and I've had multiple bouts of full blown and mania and depression, I've developed an eating disorder, suffer from extreme emetophobia, and after my visit today, I was told my pdoc believes in showing signs of schizoaffective disorder, due to hearing voices, hallucinations, antisocial behavior, not taking care of myself for long periods of time, and paranoid delusions.
I have actually had these symptoms for years now, but just thought it came with the bipolar disorder so I never brought it up until asked today. 
I feel crazy. Now that I'm looking back on everything, yes, it does fit and make sense, but that doesn't mean it doesn't suck. 
So, I'm being started on Remeron for the anorexia, Lamictal for the bipolar disorder, and Abilify for possible schizoaffevtive disorder. These are a lot of new drugs to try after not having taken any for over a year and I'm terrified honestly. I don't know how they're going to affect me and I'm really sensitive to medicine as is. 
Plus, on top of everything, it's just hard dealing with the fact this might be true, like, how the fuck do I explain to friends and loved ones I'm schizoaffrective, bipolar, anorexic, and anxiety ridden without being treated like a basket case in the end? 
I'm just lost and scared. Everything is finally starting to make sense but I'm worried what the future holds. The voices, hallucinations, and paranoid delusions have gotten worse in the past few months and what happens when it all boils over and I have a psychotic break or something? 
I'm just gonna go back to bed and hope I'm not as depressed when I wake up and can hopefully get a better handle on the situation. I really hope these meds help me. I'm going to have a massive panic attack about taking them but I have no choice anymore. 
Thank you for listening, I just really needed to get this off my chest to someone or people who actually understand what it's like.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah crap, that's true :/ It would have defeated the purpose at that point. But I've honestly done the same exact thing. Years ago, I actually did do it. Wanna know the f*cked up part? My gag reflex is pretty much non-existent and I couldn't even get myself to gag. So it was pointless. I even chugged mountain dew and ate a handful of oreos to make it happen and it wouldn't. So I was just sick and miserable for a day and a half.
But I've heard of people kind of getting over emetophobia by doing that, so if anyone ever has enough courage to do it, more power to them!  </TEXT>

But like you said, your boyfriend felt the same way but never v*, so if you made it through that wave of nausea, you can handle anything. You did awesome though! Just put yourself in that mindset if it happens again and I know you'll get through it, whether it happens or not.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's okay, I understand. My night has been pretty shitty and I've gone off on every person who has engaged me today so I feel you. Plus, it's hard to really interpret through a random post or text what kind of attitude someone has. 
I've honestly never been told anything about steroids and hormones having an effect on people with bipolar disorder, which kind of makes me mad cause I feel it should have been brought up or mentioned at one point in the last 15 years I've been treated for stuff.
I've been on the depo-provera shot for 8 years now and haven't had any issues with it, thank god. But I was recently prescribed a round of steroids for a cold that aggravated my asthma but I never took them. It just intrigued me cause I never thought steroids could have an impact on bipolar disorder and wondered the chemistry of it or maybe why it happens. I like to be knowledgeable about stuff cause I've had so many medications affect me in such weird ways and I'm left in the dark as to why or why I was never warned. 
I'm going to ask my pdoc about this on Thursday when I see her, I wonder what she knows about it, or if there are any other meds I should be cautious of.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yogurt! Antibiotics kill all the good bacteria in your tummy and digestive tract (hence the diarrhea and what not) so try something with probiotics in it. You can also just buy some probiotic pills at your pharmacy. 
But don't be scared to eat! It will help immensely and you'll just feel more sick if you don't. At least Z-packs are only 5 days, you'll be finished with it before you know it :)   </TEXT>

I was incredibly morbid, I talked about death a lot, I never slept, I ran out in front of cars just to see if I could dodge them and feel the adrenaline rush (I was actually hit by a van when I was 6 and fractured my skull), I never slept, I had incredibly violent tantrums, I saw and heard things that weren't there and even talked to them. Looking back on everything, I can honestly compare it to my manic episodes as a teenager and adult and it all feels the same to me. I've never known anything aside from constantly being manic or constantly being depressed. There's rarely been any stability.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh no, I'm sorry to hear you're still dealing with that :( I feel lucky in the regard that I have pretty much no gag reflex. But, when they do it, tell them they need to be incredibly quick. Just focus on something else around the room and not your throat or gagging. Once they do it, take a deep breath, just relax, take solace in the fact it was over in the blink of an eye, and drink some water. The quicker they do it, the better. I've had some super quick strep tests and I barely felt it cause it was so fast. Flu swabs in the nose actually bother me more than strep tests, haha.
If you really really don't want to attempt it, I agree with /u/johnnyodyssey, strep is pretty easy to spot and I think your case warrants a round of antibiotics by now. Two weeks is about how long they tell you to wait and to see your doctor if it persists. 
I really hope you feel better and wish you the best of luck! :)  </TEXT>
