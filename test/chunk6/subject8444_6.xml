	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've seen a lot of comments about increasing DPS by improving piloting skills. I understand each type of ship (cruiser, escort, science) requires different style of flying. But is there any specifics tips that would help increase DPS. I'm in a Avenger (about to upgrade to an Arbiter). As a beam boat I know broad siding is important but is there anything else I'm r missing.

Edit: I'm on console, so how should I approach timing abilities? </TEXT>
