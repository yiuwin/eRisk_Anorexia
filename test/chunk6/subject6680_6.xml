	<TEXT> Great reply, however I think a more important question is "What would it take to get Russia or the USA to unleash their entire nuclear stock pile on each other and basically ensure mutual destruction?"

A lot of the cold war movies typically had a rogue general or bat shit crazy rich person (antagonist of the Bond movies) shown as the aggressor attempting to instigate World War 3. I don't recall having seen a movie where the actual government of either country called for the launch of their nukes. Sure they were ready to retaliate, but not instigate.

 So then apart from a rogue general or bat shit crazy person, what would it take to launch that first nuke on enemy soil? Which off course will then open the flood gates for assured mutual destruction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great answer /u/BreadPresident I recall a thought experiment from many years back that somehow went something like this:

*If you were to create a chain where all the links and bonds are exactly 100% similar right through out the chain (ie exactly 0 weak points (relative to any other point in the chain) or differences in bonds) and you start to apply an increasing pulling force on either end of the chain, would you be able to exert an infinitely powerful pulling force as there would be zero reason for one bond / link to break before any of the other. Thus either all bonds break simultaneously or none at all.*

What are thoughts on this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The sad thing is I know people who won't play because they read these comments and assume the game is crap because of all the negativity.

This is the main reason I quit SWTOR, such immense negativity in that community caused (is actually still causing) that there is nowhere safe on the internet to read anything about the game or discuss the game without being bombarded with all the negativity.

Unfortunately for me, I tend to invest heavily into any MMO I am playing, this includes participating on the official web sites and sub reddits etcetera. It is very difficult to keep staying motivated to commit the required time into a game if it seems like nobody else enjoys it.

I really enjoy ESO currently in huge part to this awesome sub reddit and great helpful players in game. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Basic theory crafting questions. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-06 07:34:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all

I recently reached level 50. While leveling it was not that important to know the finer details of the game, but I am now at the stage where I need to start optimizing my build.

I have the following questions, and would really appreciate some answers (I googled all of these, but most sites seems to reference the game rules prior to the One Tamriel update and thus I am not so confident regarding their correctness as it relates to the current rules in the game):

1. How is the damage any skill can do calculated? Is the weapon damage and attribute amount (stamina or magicka) used in all skills' calculation? For instance if I am a DK and use one of the DK specific skills that deal damage irrespective of weapon type, is the currently active weapon's damage used to calculate the damage potential? If this is so, then it would be better to use a huge high damage 2H weapon with these skills right?
2. Do the amount of skills from a specific skill tree that are slotted on the current active bar, determine the rate at which the skill tree level up? I leveled using 2H and bow, but want to now go 1H+S and bow. Will there be a difference in the speed at which 1H+S level if I slot more than 1H+S skill on my 2H bar while migrating?
3. Are there realistically enough skill points (all obtainable in a reasonable amount of time) to have one main with all the crafting skills maxed as well, or should I level a character specifically only for crafting? If the second one, will the lack of crafting skills on my main cause any housing decorations to not be available, and would I need to farm all mats on my crafter only?
4. Is it possible to share items and ESO+ crafting bag contents between characters of different factions on your account (not possible in WoW for instance)? So if I make an AD character as a crafter, can she send all the crafted items to my EP Nord?
5. While fighting, can you hold down the left mouse button all the time while pressing the skill buttons? I am trying this in game but it is difficult to see if it really works.
6. Are there a similar to WoW Recount damage meter add-ons for ESO?
7. When in werewolf form, how is your damage potential calculated?


Please excuse these questions if they seem trivial, I am still a noob to the game ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just keep in mind that playing on a low spec laptop will without doubt cause the display GPU in the laptop to heat up significantly.

Usually the low end laptops do not have specialised cooling fans and openings in the case to dissipate this extra heat. This causes the whole laptop to start overheating.

After a while all this heat built up will cause the life time of the components to become less and eventually fail. This happened to me previously and researching solutions quite heavily at that point all indicated that there really is no way to prevent it. The entry level GPUs are just not made to run maxed out for hours on end.

Rather ask yourself if you really need a laptop for gaming. Often times it is cheaper (especially on the long run) to have your gaming machine as desktop self assembled box and have a separate real entry level (even without a dedicated GPU) laptop to use when you need to be mobile.

You can always as time goes on replace the components in your desktop as your games require. This is not possible on a laptop. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Do you prefer ESO to Skyrim / Oblivion / Morrowind and if so, why? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-03 12:03:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all

I personally enjoy MMO's and the MMO nature of ESO is one of the reasons I prefer playing it to Skyrim / Oblivion / Morrowind.

Recently got myself the Skyrim SE and started playing it. After the guided intro sequence was done, I spend about 15 minutes walking around and then stopped playing and thought:

* I wish I could queue for a dungeon right now.
* Currently I don't feel like questing, so let me go and RP in Riften a bit.
* There are only NPCs around me, There is nobody to whisper to 'Great outfit!' 
* While questing there was nobody to whisper to 'let us group up and destroy some undead for fighter's guild xp' for a couple of minutes
* There was nobody to share the awesomeness of a particular view with.

Basically Skyrim, even though I thoroughly enjoyed it a couple of times over, felt *empty* for me. 

ESO has spoiled me, and I hope ZOS can keep up with quality DLCs and expansions for years to come... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I really hope this happens as well.

This was one of the reasons I already pre-purchased my Morrowind upgrade. On the my account page my game is now listed as ESO:Morrwind, even the white image that used to represent TU is now showing the Morrowind image.

This enables ESO to be referenced by its expansion name, very similar to how people refer to World Of Warcraft - Legion as only Legion. It enables a sort of re-branding of the game.

The fact that it coincides with Morrowind's 15'th anniversary is also going to attract a lot of older TES game lovers, that may give the game another try and hopefully will be as amazed with it as we are. </TEXT>

I agree that WoW has probably got more players, but having played WoW from 2010 and still playing it at the moment on EU-Argent Dawn, I would say that ESO is giving WoW a run for its money.

I don't have any reputable sources either to substantiate my claim, but from reading the official forums and sub reddits, plus seeing players in game, I think ESO is doing well. This may perhaps even be due to the ESO MegaServer tech. No idea really, but would like to read your sources. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So if I understand you correctly, as soon as the light source (energy source) is not shining on the object the electrons lose their energy and fall back to ground state.

Thus, an object only have an observable color when it is being observed under a certain energy level light, and all objects are completely black in color in the absence of any energy light source? </TEXT>

If you find the female body beautiful, then Marilyn Monroe most definitely should be on your list as one of the most beautiful popular woman.

But the main thing is that she was one of the first to sexualize her image and use her sexuality to great success. </TEXT>

Assuming the process with which you convert is perfect. Thus no energy gets lost via excess heat or light. You would need 89.9 petajoules just to make one kilogram of mass.

	<TEXT> I recall reading somewhere that the tides together with the sub surface ocean currents are responsible for the ocean not being a huge fresh water lake.

if the tides and the ocean currents where to stop, the ocean could over a couple million years turn to fresh water (all the salt sinking to the bottom without constantly being stirred around).

This fresh water would then have a high chance of becoming stale and or rotten over time.

So the moon and ocean currents are one of the reasons life is so prevalent on earth, especially in the zones where the ocean meets the land.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I for one think unique and uneven numbers like primes are much more attractive :)

EDIT: Realized you marked this under Biology. So you are referring to two eyes, ears, nostrils, arms etcetera. My guess would be that having two is just enough to provide us with enough input sensory data to survive by giving us 180 degree view and manipulation of the world, while three is just too much from an evolutionary survival perspective. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can one implement role based permissions for modules at any stage? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-18 13:19:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all

When creating a Java EE Web App that requires certain access levels to information and actions (like approval of payments etcetera).

is it possible to write the foundation of the modules constituting the app initially and then at a later stage implement role based privileges.

My main reason for asking this is that I think it may be faster getting the basics of the app done and then add roles so that one do not have to struggle with permissions during development.

is this possible? More importantly is it advisable?

EDIT: Don't really get the down votes, this is /r/learnjava after all. So if what I am asking makes no sense at all, just leave that in a comment :)

What is the difference between Netbeans and JBoss Developer Studio?

From what I read so far, it seems that JBoss Developer Studio have some out of the box functionality to speed things up (do more with less code?) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Advice needed on most usable Java EE development environment setup on CentOS GNOME DE. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-15 11:36:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Good day all


I am planning on developing a Java EE Webapp on CentOS 7 GNOME DE and then deploying it on the server version of CentOS 7.


I investigated:

1. JBoss / Wildfly.
2. Netbeans.
3. Apache Tomcat.


Could anybody please advice me on which of these integrates the easiest with CentOS 7, and then which of these are the most RAD orientated in order for me to get a prototype out as soon as possible.


I am planning on using Primefaces as well.


Also, what would be the minimum base install from the full DVD to have a development system operational?


It will also be most appreciated if I could get some feedback on how your typical development environment is setup and which tools you use on a day to day basis


Thanks in advance for any comments. </TEXT>
