	<TITLE> Swagbucks videos not working? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A while ago the ncrave videos stopped working for me after quite a few times of watching the playlists but they were still showing on the page, so I ended up just watching the normal playlists.  Ive been watching the playlists for a while and all of a sudden when I tried watching another playlist it said unavailable "Sorry this offer is currently unavailable" I deleted all my cookies, tried reseting the internet, tried closing and opening my browser and nothing is working. Is it the site or what is going on? very frustrating since I cant even do that much surveys. Now Ncrave playlists are working again and the normal watch playlists are not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not so much a story its more of a experience. Here are some things a can explain.

The beginning sequence The dot grows incrementally larger, or closer, before shaping itself into a pattern of rings that simultaneously suggests a birth canal dilating, the stages of a rocket separating, and a lunar eclipse as seen through a telescope's lens.This is Johansson's character, falling to earth, or landing on earth. 

The man or men on motorcylces are her watchers to make sure she stays on task. When the men get lured to her home which is a pure black void, the black goo is another dimension which their insides are being transported back to their world cause that is what they eat. The motorcyclist kills the guy with the deformed face because she let him go. 

There are times when the heroine is a vessel emptied of meaning. Other times she seems like a human struggling to learn the subtle everyday details of a new culture.

When the man tries to have sex with the her, she gets frightened cause their bodys arent compatible and she points the lamp at her alien vag to see if theres any damage and then takes off cause she is confused and upset. The ending just speaks for itself. </TEXT>
