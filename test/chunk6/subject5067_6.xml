	<DATE> 2016-11-15 21:18:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yeah so after finally having some extra money I decided to buy a better graphics card. At the moment I'm using AMD a 10 integrated graphics that has AMD Radeon HD 8670D. So here's the problem, I bought a Gforce gtx 1060 and after connecting all the wires properly, wasn't able to use it. My computer simply won't recognize it. I kinda remember hearing that AMD doesn't allow me to upgrade into another one, but I'm shit with computers so idk if that's true.. So what do I do? Super lost with this :/, installed the drivers using the integrated graphics, but after trying to use the 'live update' i just get a popup message that says that my platform doesn't support this application.

Thanks for ANYTHING you can say, ANY info is GREATLY appreciated since I know pretty much nothing about this. 

Edit: Got it working by simply taking a better look at it and using the boot menu. Thanks for everyone since it was 100% because of you.

	<DATE> 2016-11-08 02:11:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Two things I would love to see changed, first of all, dodging while in promos cancels the promos. Why? Just give the player who dodges a loss and that's it, would help with the people who forget to pick/ban since now it's a thing too (gladly i don't too often but i know there still are people who do, and sure, you can just pay more attention, but cmon.)

Also, change it so the dodge timer (the time you need to wait after dodging) always stays at 5 minutes and the amount of lp you lose increases instead, I just don't feel like making someone wait 20 minutes because he just happened to get trolls or insanely toxic players is a right thing, ofc you could instead make votekick, but why not both? I mean wouldn't be the first time if a duo would be trolling not allowing to kick someone =)

Thanks for reading and share your thoughts! Also happy next season </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, the item is bad, that's the reason pretty much no one who actually tries NEVER gets it. I've seen some ezreal otp (can't remember his name) go hypercarry ezreal when his team was lacking some dps and he had to deal a lot more damage than he ever would've by just hitting q's. But yeah, neither of those items work too well in my opinion, so just skip the berserker greaves and ER and win some games  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I prioritize manamune over sheen because it makes stacking tear cost less mana and gives me more room to trade with autoattacks. If you go sheen you dont stand a chance in a 1v1 against bf--zeal but if you have more ad (from manamune) and you hit your q's you can actually win the enemy. You wanna make sure you get 2 passive stacks ( or 3, depending on if you use your e offensively or not) before you go in for fights. Also try stacking fervor with w + sheen procs when possible =)  </TEXT>

Attack speed boots would be the last viable option and i guess you could take them but then i suggest you skip tear and build the itembuild around essence reaver, which isn't as good </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uhh, 200 ez games plat 1 eu so i hope you don't take anything i say for granted :D.. But yeah, in my opinion going ibg (or frozen fist, however you wanna say it) first is better, due to the dueling potential it gives you, I do however ALWAYS get manamune before the ibg because it gives pretty much no stats that help you win over sheen (the armor shouldn't matter as much because you're meant to poke them before engaging).
So when would i go tri then? Personally i think trinity is great against olaf and zac, it gives you more dps with your autoattacks and q, but less control and defense stats, but since these 2 will pretty much run trough everyone and can't be slowed effectively, the phage movespeed helps a lot, also helps with kiting. 

So yeah, personally I enjoy going blue build ezreal because I'm super aggressive and I enjoy e'ing into them. Also the elo I'm in currently is pretty bad so i can dodge most abilities and the armor makes it so basic attacks, which i can't dodge won't hit so hard. I also tend to catch people with the slow a lot. (so muramana, ibg, ionian boots, lw (mortal or ldr depending on matchup) bork and then one defensive item that suits the game (there's ALWAYS need for one if you ever get that far) 

Also, if you want the slow, you can choose to get frozen mallet as defensive item and go trinity force, but i'd never really do that unless they have some bruisers that just run to you (so xin/jax etc.)  </TEXT>

If someone happens to know any ezreal otps dia1+ please let me know too :)
