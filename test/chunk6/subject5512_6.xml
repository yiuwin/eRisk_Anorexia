	<TEXT> I read somewhere that UBW is supposed to be a bit of an improved experience after Zero. I was also intending switching UBW and Zero around as an option just so ya know. What's wrong with the one I already put up may I ask?

Sorry, just new to the ordeal is all... I haven't even started anyways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got any? For example stuff like balancing multiple series, utilising the watch time you have, managing larger series, etc.

A few of my own:

- Largely focus most either on a large series while dotting into smaller ones, or speading out the bigger ones and managing more focus upon smaller ones.

- Pick shows that appeal most to you and you think are worth watching.

- Plan your routes to avoid complication and series ends being failed to be tied up.

- If you can't finish something like an episode or movie, you can always keep track of where you left off and pick up the next time you're free. </TEXT>
