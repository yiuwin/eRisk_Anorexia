	<TEXT> I mean, it all depends on demand and represses. It will probably increase in value since it'll be a first pressing of the album, and the fact it's red is also a bonus.

A good example would be the original Slappy E.P...black vinyl sells for roughly 20, whereas coloured has sold as much as 50. However, it's worth noting that the colour vinyl of the Slappy E.P. were limited to a certain number which increases value. But it all depends on the demand of the product at the time. I would say it's a worthy investment for the price.

	<TEXT> I believe it means they will not do another pressing in red. If it were limited to a number it would say somewhere "Limited to 5,000" or whatever the number may be :)  </TEXT>

Restless Heart Syndrome (just don't dwell on the lyrics too much)...
Warning...
Misery...
and most songs from Foxboro Hot Tubs' "Stop, Drop and Roll!" Especially Red Tide...
