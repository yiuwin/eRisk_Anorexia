	<TEXT> But you don't want the government to steal people's money for "charity" so clearly you hate charity.

Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) As I said, seek out a place where you're views are in the majority 2) I didn't say anything about rights - I spoke about viewpoints.

So instead of fighting for my views, I should leave? That's not very American at all.

Yeah, bullshit.

Wow, great response pal

You're right - there could be other forms of taxes

I agree. The only form of tax that doesn't create economic inefficiency is the land-value tax.

But this one works

lol what. Aside from the fact that income taxation is theft, it creates economic inefficiency and is extremely easy to find loopholes.

Wow, insults! 

Wow, not an actual response!

And you would be wrong - but you're good at that. I was around through it all, and watched the damage it did.

Oh, I doubt that. If you were actually alive through the 70s and 80s and old enough to understand what was going on, there's no way you could think the economy was worse under Reagan than under Carter.

Wow, a link to an article by a partisan hack that isn't even an economist - it must be right!

Care to debunk any of the points made? Also, you're just plain wrong - he has a degree in economics as well as a law degree, both from Harvard, and he graduated magna cum laude both times. I'd love to see you try and debunk any of the facts and figures he cited.

Additional biased source - FTFY

Again, you don't even try to debunk any of the facts or stats mentioned. "Herf fucking derf it's biased" isn't an argument.

I also like how you didn't even try to tackle the fact that Keynesian models have no way to handle stagflation. I'd be amazed if you even understood Keynesian theory. 

Just another typical liberal hack who rejects reality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the majority demanded it, it would change

Yeah, because 1) majorities always win (minority-rule regimes were never a thing) and 2) our country is not meant to protect minority rights. Totally.

If you're not happy with it as a holder of a minority viewpoint, you have the right to leave and attempt to find one that agrees with your viewpoints.

Actually, according to our founders, I have the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The current government has no intention of allowing me any of those.

Your point is what, exactly?

The fact that the income tax is not at all necessary for the functioning of government, as you claimed. You lefty types can never seem to focus on a conversation for more than ten seconds.

Hard to neglect something that didn't happen.

I know you're probably in your teens or early 20s, so you weren't around, but it quite literally did. [You're simply ignoring reality and facts if you think it didn't.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2011/05/05/reaganomics-vs-obamanomics-facts-and-figures/#3b22d1709ac9)

[Additional source](http://www.heritage.org/taxes/report/the-real-reagan-economic-record-responsible-and-successful-fiscal-policy)

By the way, the staglation of the 70s was literally impossible according to flawed Keynesian models.

	<TEXT> Your first statement is just typical nonsense. None of us ever consented to the "social contract", and if we want to escape we cannot, because the government uses force to make us comply with its demands. None of us "created" the government. (Governments originally arose purely through martial force, including ours. Some social contract.) Finally, the income tax did not exist at all in the USA until the early 1900s.


Your second point entirely neglects the economic rebound "trickle down" economics created and instead focuses on the name, which is a clever deflection but totally not the point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If we are the government, and the government's money belongs to the government, why shouldn't the government use its money to help the poor?

This is the most fucked logic I've ever heard. The government does not create wealth or value. It creates currency to denote a certain amount of value. This is why making new currency makes all the currency less valuable - it's not creating new wealth.

The government issues currency to rationalize the economy and make a standard, unified way of trading value, rather than a barter system.

The government creates small slips of paper which we mutually agree to recognize as symbolizing a certain amount of value. (That value is decided by market prices, by the way, not the government.) 

The government does not create the value which I possess, which those slips of paper represent. While you're right that the government "creates" currency, the government has no right to take the value which I created and own for itself. 

If we are the government, and the government's money belongs to the government, why shouldn't the government use its money to help the poor?

Because taxation is theft, and it's not really charitable to take everyone else's money and give it away. (Besides the point that welfare does not really help the poor in most cases.)

Charity is self-sacrifice. It is not self-sacrificial or charitable to insist that *everyone else* give money to the corporation which has a monopoly on power for it to then redistribute. It *is* charitable to give your own money and time, and if you support charity, you should do so - but you shouldn't force everyone else to do the same. </TEXT>

I have no idea where are you taking this information of yours that "free market" has helped states developed

The history of the world since the Industrial Revolution. Competition and capitalism have massively driven innovation. (Hint: You'd have to read actual books, or maybe just articles not hosted on Salon and HuffPo, to realize this.)

The world is more than Republican vs Democrat ideology

I'm neither a Republican nor a Democrat. What I am is a major in economics, history, and political scientist. Quite a typical liberal, assuming everyone else is just ignorant.

there a LOT of government intervention and mechanisms to push economies forward in all successful cases of development

Not really. Government interventionism is what destroyed Ireland's economy in the 60s and 70s and will likely ruin our economy too if the president gets what he wants. The primary "government interventions" in the successful economies you're noting were ordoliberal and neoliberal reforms designed to help free up the market and encourage private enterprise; not large-scale government interventions like you're probably thinking.

please don't let your political ideology blind your faith.

I don't. I also don't let my faith blind my knowledge of economics. </TEXT>

Trickle down, now you've lost me. Shot still ain't working. 

Trickle-down is a liberal epithet for supply-side economics, which dragged us out the stagflation of the 1970s (which was impossible according to Keynesian models). You're probably too young to remember that.

 On fact it was so NOT tenable that Reagan borrowed against social security (a self-sustaining system) to make it work.

Social security is "a self-sustaining system"? It's a Ponzi scheme that has trillions in unfunded liabilities. Not only that, but there is a clear correlation between strong socialized care for the elderly and people having less kids. Less kids means less workers down the line to pay into social security, and thus the strain will become harder over time as a smaller workforce takes care of the generation preceding them. Social security is the opposite of self-sustaining - that's why even liberals are talking about means testing and raising the retirement age.

What is it about countries like Germany that scare you?

Gee, when did you stop beating your wife? Nothing about countries like Germany "scares" me. If you want to talk about "countries like Germany", shall we discuss the fact that their population is almost entirely homogenous, that they had no minimum wage until 2014, that students who do poorly are not allowed to go to tertiary education, that there are a limited number of diplomas, etc.? 

Of course, in your mind, Germany just has free healthcare, free tuition, free everything - you don't understand the situation or policies they've implemented in the slightest.  </TEXT>

Funding for the military was as high, if not higher, than ever under the Obama administration - in no small part thanks to Bush's idiotic war in Iraq. 

We need to cut military spending, mostly by bringing our troops home from overseas and having our allies do their fair share, if we are truly going to make a dent on the deficit.

	<TEXT> ...Do you not understand debates? I'm showing you how your logic is shit.

1. Oliver Cromwell was a revolutionary republican against the monarchy. Practically The definition of progressive.

2. Eisenhower was a progressive Republican who expanded the government and was covertly supportive of the left, including the USSR.

3. The Soviet Union was a left-wing country. Stalin was commonly called "the leader of progressive humanity" and when members of the Progressive Party went to Russia they said, "We have seen the future and it works."

4. Puritans were progressives against the establishment Church of England. They were generally pacifists and supported strong government. 

5. Of course the French Revolution were progressive. They founded a republic in the name of popular sovereignty and equality. The French Revolution was the ultimate progressive revolution, which began a tide that swept away the ancient order of Europe. Many of the revolutionaries were early socialists, like Proudhon.

If you think those groups are not progressive, you either have no knowledge of history, no historical context, or no understanding of progressivism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I cackle with glee watching the poor die. I sometimes toss money into crowds of hobos and watch them fight to the death. I adopt dozens of small Cambodian orphans (orphaned because of the military-industrial complex I donate most of my money to) and then put them in a forest, telling them that on the other side is a shack full of food, but only one can enter - the rest must die. Little do they know, of course, that the food is plastic. Poor little Lan Nthok kills her fellow countrymen and enters the cabin to find nothing but plastic food. Yes, I am Mitch McConnell. </TEXT>

(Fun fact: we haven't had a governor from upstate since the 1920s, and before Gilibrand, the last senator from upstate was in the 1960s.)

I'm glad you understand and support it - be sure to vote for the Constitutional Convention on the ballot this year; upstate secession or devolution is one of the big issues. </TEXT>

Of those 22 billionaires, 13 -- or more than half -- gave predominantly to liberal groups or groups affiliated with the Democratic Party. The other nine gave predominantly to conservative groups. (A list of billionaires and how much they donated can be found here.)
