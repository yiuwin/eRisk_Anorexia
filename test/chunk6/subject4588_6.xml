	<TEXT> How the language law uses and its status in society affects how we, as people and as political subjects, make sense of the world. It's not about the views one holds, but about *how the person herself is created as a function of the law*. Hope I'm making sense to y'all here.

This receives extensive treatment in academia, but I wonder whether this will be something that laypeople will actually contend with. I really doubt it.

	<TEXT> So I had just immigrated to America from [lol guess where]. My mother and I settled in an Atlanta exurb (I think I read it was the most backwards city in America at some point?), and I was enrolled in the local elementary school. 

Two weeks in, my 4th grade class watches a video on the digestive system. We get to the point where the feces makes its way through the intestine. All of a sudden, this girl gets my attention. She says "You see that?", pointing to the shit: "That's you."

Still hurts to this day, a decade and a half later. </TEXT>
