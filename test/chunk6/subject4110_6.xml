I work in downtown San Francisco and I was talking to my dad on the phone in a large group of people while I was waiting to cross at a crosswalk. My dad and I were discussing how trump was the right person for America and I had at least 3-4 turn around in disgust and tell me what an idiot I was. Well let me tell you... we are going to take America back and show all these complete fucking idiots what we can do to MAKE AMERICA FUCKING GREAT AGAIN.  </TEXT>
