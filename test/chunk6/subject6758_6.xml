	<TEXT> But what's the fun in that? I'd rather do this (https://youtu.be/FpN4wl74CuE) than do a silly "land invasion". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Philipp II's invasion of England (Spanish armada). The navy was decimated, the treasury was depleted and it marked the beginning of the end for Spain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No the thing is, the effects of Armageddon is still there. Pops die faster and the defenses go down faster. The only thing is that there are no effects when doing the actual bombardment. The effects occur but with no effects. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, same here. I wanted to absolutely annihilate my enemies from orbit so it's a bit of a disappointment that nothing happens. I mean, copying the full bombardment animation would be better because at least there WOULD BE SOMETHING THERE!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's basically full bombardment but you bomb the planet so you can kill off the pops instead of removing its defenses. A more extreme version if you will. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about Horizon Signal (spoilers) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-06 17:22:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I reached the point in Horizon Signal where the I have to fight the captain. This part of the event was triggered by a construction ship so I order my fleet to travel to the system. However, the captain just died and apparently I waited for to long. Whenever I try to research the anomalies it simply says "We have no way of researching this project" even though my scientist(s) fulfill the anomaly requirements (level 2 and of founder species).

Have I broken the event chain or do I simply need to wait for another popup (no spoilers for the event chain beyond this point please)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They did and they still have. However, if you Armageddon bombard you won't get any light dots on the planet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a bit disappointing to bombard a planet with Armageddon, only to not see a single explosion appear. </TEXT>
