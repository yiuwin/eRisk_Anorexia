	<TEXT> You are right, but I also think that people need to stop being such assholes about it and disregard every other opinion. Some people may actually think 30fps do look better and there are games out there where it just doesn't matter.

Honestly I find this whole "PC master race" stuff annoying as shit. Let people play the games they want to play the way they want to and be done about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But a constant 30fps are for the most part a better experience than a inconsistent 60fps. The thing what most people seem to forget is that either framerate has to be consistent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not the state. You have to tell the judges because the law is there. Also there are a few more things to consider when talking about 86 StGB . For example is not only the showing but also the producing of the symbols illegal. And only the Swastika with the arms  pointing right is forbidden, because it was a symbol of a now forbidden political group. These groups are fobidden because they go against everything our constitution stands for, thus they are not covered under our constitution.

I would bet that you may actually get the right to sell a game with the symbols in it, if you would take it up to the judges, however depending on the game it may negativley impact your rating, which means instead of a USK 16 for your shooter you may get USK 18 or instead of USK 12 for your strategy game you get USK 16 which in theory is worse for the sales.

Just a little interesting fact at the end: Most games are using the Reichskriegflagge from the German empire instead of the one from the Third Reich, because they are simmilar, but the first one does not show any forbidding symbols. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remember the sentiment of one of the comments in this chain was

 If you call yourself a gamer and haven't heard of Samus Aran then you're not a gamer. 

That is just wrong. You can call yourself a gamer and don't know who Samus Aran is. Actually I didn't knew it until 3 or 4 years ago, because for the most part of my life I was playing games on the PC and there is no Metroid there. I mean I knew Metroid as a name for a game but didn't knew the name of the protagonist.

Same goes for everything else. Saying "If you don't know xyz you are not a true gamer" is invalid in it self. Because no the knowledge of games makes you a gamer, but the fact that you play them as a hobby, that you have fun playing them, that is, for me atleast, the defining point of a gamer. Gamer for me is a synonym to "Videogame player". </TEXT>

I kind of disagree. The gaming culture is not homogenous as other cultures. People who never played Nintendo and don't give a rats ass about other platform may never heard about her. The thing is however if you are a Nintendo gamer you know these characters or at least most of them and you give damn about them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are talking about the first few months/years, but a child still costs money afterwards and while you can get your job back after Mutternzeit, most parents I know take way longer off than that and thus most likely loose the position they are in. After that they don't get the same job for the same money again.

Don't get me wrong I agree that the money thing exaggerated but I think it's still the biggest issue there is. It's very hard to have career while having a family and children as women. It's sad but that's how it currently is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off: I actually upvoted you, because you are contribution to the discussion and that's what they are for.

Actually, the only difference is who you protect. Kids, even the good behaving ones, do to a degree interfere with the people around them. Be it by choice of the people or not. The latter is the problem this owner tries to address by giving people who don't want to be interfered by children a space where they can be, while still giving the families and kids a huge area where they themselves can be.

 I'd vote against a per-se ban and say the owner has the right to throw the misbehaving family out.

He has that right and within that right is to issue such a ban like he has done. It's his property so he can make the rules (to a degree at least). And I would bet that it's harder to throw those families out than to ban kids in one area. He is a business owner so he has to make money he can look out for the misbehaving kids all the time and it's not his fucking job.

 And as for the accident in the kitchen: the good old "Betreten auf eigene Gefahr, Eltern haften fr ihre Kinder" sure would help.

No it wouldn't because you have to proove that the parent was not watching their child like they have to. These signs are just "jokes", they have nearly no relevance in a court case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It is just discrimination if you don't allow someone in an area because of the age.

So it's just discrimination that people under 18 are not allowed into bars? No, it's not, same goes here. If he says this is an 18+ area it's his decision and only his. The family can still sit eat and play in any other area of the biergarten.

 Do we really want to ban kids from areas because they are annyoing?


Actually yes. If the kids are a hazard to or annoy other guests or personal then they should not be allowed to be there. The owner made the decision after several incidents as written in the article.

 Just another case of German kids-hating

I don't hate kids, I acually am indifferent about kids I don't know and who did not behave bad in public while I was able to observe it. However I'm annoyed by kids that misbehave and bother strangers in public. Yes, the kid it self is only partly to blame still it has to take some blame for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually think that the system as a whole is better than double elimination, because double elim takes away part of the reason to win the matches in the upper bracket. Just look at most other sports that are around. Football (Soccer) all big tournaments are single elim, same goes for Tennis, Icehockey, Basketball and so on. I know they are only to a small degree comparable but still every lost match, even if it's a BO5, counts there, because it puts you closer of getting thrown out of the tournament.

If the seeding was done right, I can't really say, we have to see how the tournament playes out and maybe see it a few more times in the future.

As for people complaining: That's normal you'll always find someone who complains. </TEXT>

So SHA-256 and SHA-1 are used to save the key for the encryption most likely RSA. But yeah SHA-256 has no known collisions while SHA-1 is not anymore used since 2010 in most cases. Both are developed by the NSA if you want to use an algorith that is not developed by the NSA you may take SHA-3. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I think I kind of blind sided her. It was in 10th grade, she was 18 I was 16. We lost or virginity together and the relationship was actually pretty good, but I just couldn't see myself with her in the future. The thing is in grade 10 you either stay in school or you leave to get an apprenticeship of some kind. She wasn't the brightest bulb there is and I knew I wanted at least to get the permit to go to university, which meant 3 more years of school. Also she didn't really fly that good with my family.

So after the last school trip for which we were seperated because we were in different classes, I decided to end it. She broke down in front of me crying and sobbing. I couldn't do much and just left her to it. Later she accused me of cheating because on the trip I was hanging out with a few girls, but nothing ever happened. Also she ignored me and let doors fall shut before me when I had my hands full.

But a few years later we met by chance and talked about it and stayed friends for a while, till I moved away. She recently married the dude she got together afterwards.

But I also have been on the other end. I took the last breakup really hard. It wasn't something long, but honestly it was the first time where I could've seen a future with her. She broke up with me a few days before I lost my job. I was really really down in the drains. I couldn't really think clear for a few weeks and if not for a really good doctor I would've ended my life right there. I have a history of being depressed and suicidal so it was not only because of that, I'm not that pathetic! I tried to stay friends with her, because she is just an awesome funny person and even went to a concert that I had a ticket for, where I knew I would bump into her. Didn't go well and I cut all ties after the concert. </TEXT>

I dont know what else I could write about me, so a little bit about what I look for. I would like to get to know you and become friends or maybe more. It would be awesome if you were from the greater area where Im from (e.g. Cologne or Venlo), but thats not needed just a big bonus.

	<TEXT> I have taken IC/ICE 3 times now and one out of the times the train was delayed, other than that no problems. But if one thinks about it, it's only logical that a smallish problem on an IC/ICE has more effect for the journey than on a RB/RE/S-Bahn. Also I think the problem with IC/ICE is that there are not many alternatives, because they are long distance trains and it does not make sense to have 3 different routes for the same goal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly though it's hard to compare our train system to the system in Japan or in the U.S. Afaik the train system in Japan is in private hands while here in Germany it's still run by the state. Yes I know the Bahn is officialy just a private company but the only shareholder is the state. Also I think we have way more track than in Japan, afaik we have around 75000km or tracks while Japan is around 30000km. And many and more small "Kuhkffer" have a station which are adding additional stops.

Not saying the Bahn doesn't have problems, it sure has, but I don't think complaining about it the way many people do, funnily enough I see more people who rarely take the train complain about the Bahn than people who use it daily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As stated as reponse to your other comment. I think the study is somewhat faulty, because understanding the human psyche is damn near impossible.

Yes a divorce has/can have negative effects on the child, but no that does not mean that an ongoing marriage is the better solution. If the parents, or even one parent, are unhappy or resentful  it has also pretty negative effects on the kid. It's not a choice I ever want to make in my life, because neither options seems good for me.

I think the whole view on marriage and human relationships is skewered today. As stated in my last sentence I think that is the problem not the divorce it self. Divorces are just the symptom not the reason. The reason is that nowadays in most countries there is no instituion "forcing" you to hold onto a bad marriage like the chuch and divorces are not frown upon as much anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying that the kids are better of. An intact family is better no questions asked, but I would wager that an family where there is often times fights, lies and such is not better than a broken family. There is no 100% solution that works all the time.

I also find the study somewhat faulty because the human psyche is nothing simple and we are not anywhere near of understanding it. Also I never said that a divorce is not harmful, but that it alone is never the reason for bad things that happen to persons who parents are divorced.

As I stated elsewhere my parents divorced. I was about 6 years old when it happened. I suffered and had problems understanding it. That **combined** with other factors led to a bad behaviour and many problems in the years following. But the divorce is **not** the sole reason and I don't blame my parents for it, because they tried afterwards their best.

Even though I'm claiming that the divorce may have been the best option for my parents, my sister and me, because otherwise there would've been resentment between my parents and they would've fought more and I think that is a way bigger problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You think you would've done better but you don't know. My parents also divorced and yes the divorce influenced me and not only positive, but I do not blame them for my problem. You mistakes and mishaps are not their fault, they are the result of your decision and mulling about what could've been if they didn't divorced does nothing for you.

I know many kids of divorced parents and sadly many blame their mistakes on the divorce, while yes it has an impact on you and yeah it may lead to a few problems, no it's not the sole reason for it. The divorce of my parents is not the sole reason I'm depressed to claim so would be just wrong. There many and more factors that  shape you and that shape any kid.

And I kind of agree children need both parents if the divorce happens in a age when they are aware. But that does not mean you can blame all the shit they do on the divorce.

I'm not tossing around divorce casually, but I think we should get away from the thinking that an marriage will and should last forever. Humans are not made to be monogamous they never will be and yeah for some it may work, but all the "good old" mariages people are referring to a habbit not love anymore. </TEXT>

Not directly but our mom is just the kind of mom where her children are the center of her life so there was no quality time left between her and my dad.

So if they don't want to talk maybe it's because of a simmilar reason, because they fear you feel like you were the reason, which they don't think you are. </TEXT>

The difference between those two are the game modes avaiable ,afaik in Ranked you have All Pick and Captains Mode, while in unranked you have a few more. [Here's](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Game_Modes) a list of all Game Modes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, I'll give it a shot. It's my first time so please don't be so harsh ;) Also sorry for the bad structure

***

I'm starting with the obvious. You are a Civ player and like the series very much, this led to you being most active on /r/civbattleroyale where you are somewhat known by the people there. From there I also gathered that you like writing after all you seem to write a story about a Norwegian pikemen. Beside Civ and writing you seem also to enjoy reading stories like Asoif or Death Note or stuff from the Marvel Universe.

You never really gave away any personal information, be it age or country, so it's hard to guess, but I would wager you are from Norway, Sweden or Denmark, because you used Norwegish in on of your texts for /r/civbattleroyale . You are somewhere in your twenties, most likely near 25. That's based on you liking Death Note, ASOIF and Marvel and also afaik it's the most common age here on reddit.

You seem to never really swear and seem to accept other viewpoints and opinions while not taking everything for 100% true. All in all I would say you are pretty laid back and more on the nice side of the people.

***

I hope what I wrote makes somewhat sense :) As you said you don't have a lot there yet, but it forms for me a rough picture of a nice and somewhat cool guy/gal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently played as a Venge support with a Stom Spirit in my lane. We secured a double kill for rune at 0:00 together with Pudge. The second kill was possible because for one of the first times I was able to body block an enemy long enough. We proceeded to stomp the game Storm and I won our top lane with ease.

Another game I was playing as a Lina support and managed to shift into a nuker/semi carry role at the end. We had Beastmaster, Tinker, Drow, Clock and Lina while the enemies had Slark, Warlock, PL, Necro and Kunkka. We knew from the start that if the enemies got farm we'll be crushed. We managed to secure an early lead just to throw it away (swing from 9k gold for us to 5k for them) but always recovered. The game took about an hour, but somehow we managed to win the team fights and win it. It just felt so good to win a game against a team that by all means should've crushed us with the farm they got. </TEXT>

 excluding it from running on opposing hardware just feels wrong

That statement is wrong. With all I have read about it, it's working on opposing hardware just not as good and they also don't forbid the devs to implement the stuff from AMD next to their own stuff so that AMD users also get more fancy stuff. Seriously I don't think Nvidia is to blame alone for this, everybody involved, and that includes AMD, is to blame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For SSL certificates there are different tiers of verfication. The cheapest and most common variant is the so called domain validated where you either just have to validate via e-mail or a file on the host. Then there are organization validated certificates, for these you have to provide "proof" that you are who you claim. E.g. entry in phone dictonary or commercial register report.
The highest tier is the EV certificate. This is really really complicated to get, but has the highest security. I don't know all procedures but I do know that they may involve a notary.

You can see if a site has an EV certificat by the green lock in the address bar with the company name and country next to it. [This is](http://imgur.com/fKoxsnE) what it looks like for steam in Chrome.

But you are right if you see an scammer using an ssl cert report it so the issuer, most likely they'll revoke it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You've continually circumvented how these actions are putting attractive women on pedestals and minimizing them to sex objects. You're not thinking about shit, and it shows.

You never said how they did it. Please explain to me why it's puttin attractive women on a pedestal when someone develops feelings for them. Go head explain it to my puny little head, because you seem oh so wise......Seriously though if that for you is really the same then I pitty you, becasue you seem to have a skewered view of what feelings are.

Regarding sex objects I already gave an explanation how it's not always a conscious choice to see someonein a sexual manner. We are animals all of us and thus we have this things called hormones and stuff in us and we can't fully control them with our mind, because if we could the world would be either better or far worse, I'm not sure which one.

 Yeah I'm crying a river about all the men whose dicks I didn't touch. Poor me.

No that's not why you are poor, you are poor because you are ignorant to other viewpoints. You are ignorant about the fact that others may have legit standpoints that are not the same as yours. At least regarding this matter.

I'm not saying that women should trust all men, but neither should they distrust all of them. Neither of both options is healthy. I'm not attractive I never experienced it, but I experienced the other side. Where you meet an attractive person, talk to them, get to know them and even though it was never your intention from the get go you start developing feelings for them. That means either you lie to them about having theese feelings or tell them and they think you lied about them from the get go, either way you loose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The comment said he likes attention of attractive women because it boosts his ego.

Yes, and so what? For most guys the attention of attractive women or sometimes even women at all is not something common. It boost the ego there is no harm in that. The same happens the otherway around. Attention from people one finds attractive is always an ego booster.

 And that he's hidden his true motives when continuing to see these women.

Okay, let's be honest here for a while. Humans are animals our highest goal in life is reproduction. As a male our brain tells us to spread our seed as far as possible (aka to have sex with as many women as possible). That means if a woman is attractive for a man he'll sooner or later think about her in a sexual way. However at least for me and most the guys I know it's not mutual exclusive to see someone as a friend and to see them in a sexual way. It does not mean one acts on it, but it's hard not to notice whenether the other person is attractive.  
But here's the deal, most women don't want to know that, at least not in a direct way. I think most know it in an abstract manner, but being told by a friend is something completly different. So I hide that part of me from my female friends, because they are not important to me.  
However what the first comment of this chain wrote means for me, that he is not only attracted to them, but also kind of falls for them, because he misinterprets their attention, which is sadly a mistake that many guys, including me, do. The thing is, as I wrote in another comment as a reply to you, most guys not used to the attention of women they find attractive, thus they misinterpret it easly. It's actually sad for both parties. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's not what thoughts go on in anyone's head makes them jerks or not jerks. It's their actions.

So if I know I'll get hurt and withdraw because of that I'm a jerk? Sure it would be better to endure the pain and "just get over it". I really like it when people who seemingly never have been in that situation where they had to "get over it" are talking about it.

 Women (or overly-pursued attractive people) shouldn't be required to continually give others the benefit of the doubt. They have the right (and in my opinion, the self duty) to minimize trust when it comes to new "friends."

Where did anybody state otherwise? Seriously point me to it because I don't see it. In the chain abouve your comment I don't see anything like that. All I see is a possible explanation for the behaivour described by OP. Nothing else.

 I've been there. And after all this time, not one of those guys made legit use of their second chances, they used the opportunities to trick me into a relationship ("let's hang out," "ok" "it's a date!" "...no, it isn't."), or as a sexual dumping post when they were lonely/horny ("sorry to hear your boss is making you bend over backwards. I'd like to see you bend over hurr hurr!").

Which is complety different to anything posted in the comment chain above. There never was any mention of second chance as I said above just one possible explanation to the things OP described.

 OP don't give too much credence to these "I'm so misunderstood" posts, trust your gut.

Again not one comment said anything like that. It was an explanation nothing more. He didn't say "I'm so misunderstood" more so that he misunderstands.

I think it's sad that you apperently had so many bad experiences, but really not all and I would wager most guys are not like you described. Guys are just humans just as you and every women/girl out there. They have feelings, hopes, dreams, insecurities and much more, they are not some 2D cardboard cutouts and everybody is different. Does that mean you should trust everybody right from the get go? No, but it also means you shouldn't fully distrust everybody either. </TEXT>

He could've had nothing like that in mind but humans can not control all of their feelings. It saddens me to see that someone has such a dark outlook on the whole male part of the population, because it most likely comes from a very very very very small sample size. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There were several reasons for that as far as I know. The SS was never a part of the state but always only part of the NSDAP, sure they later were kind of a second military, but the official military was the Wehrmacht. The SS was kind of elitist, because as far as I know there weren't drafted and you had higher standarts than the Wehmacht, at least at the beginning. Also the SS was often called the elite of the German army, while as mentioned above they never really were part of the army. If I remember correctly the SS was also officaly more a police than a military unit.

In general there was always huge mistrust between the seperate parts of the Third Reich. Before the SS was what she became known for there was the SA which they basicly killed and then merged into themselfes. </TEXT>

"They" are Farin Urlaub and his band the Farin Urlaub Racing Team. Oh and I want to add that there are people who think his voice is annoying, but we don't talk about them ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't call players like Lewandowski who got hit hard enough to break the nose and the upper jaw, played till the end and even participated in the next big game a pussy. Or someone like Messi who  most defenders can't stop without a foul, but who still manges to keep going or all the other players whose names I don't recall but who don't dive.

Yes there is diving in football, but sometimes it's not really diving but trying to prevent an injury from happening or plainly losing balance because suddenly there are another 80kgs on one side of you. Seriously watch a football game with someone who knows his shit and you'll notice how many small fouls you don't see and how many real dives there are.

Also just because Hockey is basicly just a big brawl with a bit of gameplay in between does not mean any sport has to be like that ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The worst queuing I always see is getting off and on trains. People don't seem to remember that there are most likely people on the train wanting to get off.

The worst is when it's while rush hour...so stupid and annoying and it takes way longer for everyone so you are not faster home. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup I'm the asshole because I have to insult someone... For clarification bike in this context means bicycle for me not motorbike. If you meant motorbike it was an misunderstanding. To phrase my last statement from the previous post a bit different: the flow of the motorised traffic is more important than the flow of bicycles. In general the direction with the heaviest traffic has a higher priority. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's a crossing designed for bikes okay, but he didn't say anything about it. For me it seems more to be a normal crossing most likely of two major roads, then for me bikes are not as important as the flow of cars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It may be that the crossing is traffic triggered so it won't show green until at least one car is waiting for it. </TEXT>
