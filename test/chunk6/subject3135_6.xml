	<TEXT> Alba confessing that she wanted Xo to have an abortion is still one of the most jaw-dropping secrets, but this confession comes pretty close in my book. It's just been such a major part of the series that it will be interesting to see how it'll effect Jane's future decisions when it comes to sex! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. The promise Jane made to Alba was really affecting Jane. Almost every time Jane decides to sleep with someone, Alba somehow comes up (Michael, Jonathan). It was her go-to excuse, so it'll be interesting to see how she reacts to making the decision to have sex. </TEXT>

I remember being very young and getting so confused watching "The Color of Friendship" on Disney. At the time, I could not wrap my head around the fact that white girl was from South Africa. It was the first time I can remember thinking about the world on such a large scale and that realizing that stereotypes are not always correct. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that's what I'm confused about too.

In the middle of the episode, the police say that Elena (Mutter) is Clara/Rose (Sin Rostro)'s step mother. But then at the end, Rose calls Elena "Mom".

Do step children typically call their step parents "Mom/Dad"? I don't know. Hopefully we'll find out next week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I refuse to give up hope for Petra/Rafael 2.0.

I'll be the first to admit that Rafael and Petra's marriage was a disaster due to the circumstances. How and why they got together, the miscarriage, Jane's pregnancy, and their respective crazy families. But I feel like there are just way too many instances where the audience is shown that underneath allllll of those situations, that they really do care and love each other. </TEXT>

-unknowingly lets Mateo eat the diamond

-get chews out by Jane for letting Mateo eat a diamond

-plans Xo's lavish birthday party which she doesn't go to

-has his beautiful proposal derailed and his entire relationship with Xo is thrown into question

	<TEXT> Emilio marries Mia and they have Luisa. Mia dies. Then Emilio marries Elena (Mutter) and they have Rafael. Elena takes the $10 million and divorces Emilio. Elena then gets remarried to someone who already has a daughter, Clara/Rose/Sin Rostro, and also [Future Spoiler?](/s "she has a son with this new husband, thereby giving Rafael a half-brother"). Later Rose has an affair with Luisa and also marries Emilio until his death/murder. So Rose essentially marries and murders her step mother's ex-husband and also has an affair with step mother's ex-husband's daughter. Which means that Mutter is Sin Rostro's step mother.

I'm confused just reading what I wrote.

Edit: Well, crap. Now I'm not sure if the police were incorrect in saying that Clara/Rose/Sin Rostro is Elena's *step* daughter or if Elena really is Rose's actual mother. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I met my best friend in kindergarten. I still think to this day that she hypnotized me to be her best friend because she was a mean and rude kid. When we were in 3rd grade, I went over to her house to play. Her family had just gotten a new refrigerator, so we get the idea to make a clubhouse out of the large box.

Now this bitch has me design and create the entire clubhouse. There were windows and pillows inside and I rigged a flashlight to hang like a chandelier in the clubhouse which took me for-fucking-ever. I spent *hours* on this damn clubhouse and it looked awesome.

But after alllllll my hardwork which I did by my damn self, my bitch of a best friend doesn't let me into the clubhouse. I have to sit outside and watch her play in it.

It's almost 15 years later and I'm still pissed about it. </TEXT>
