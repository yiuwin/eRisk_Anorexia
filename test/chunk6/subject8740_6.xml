	<TEXT> There is a "Chiropractic neurologist" near my parents house who tries to present himself as a comparable alternative to a "traditional" neurologist. 

According to his website, he treats ADHD, autism, dementia, SEIZURES, migraines and he REHABILITATES STROKE PATIENTS. There was a lot of other quackery on there but I got too angry and had to go take some deep breaths.  </TEXT>

Plus, even if you aren't exposed to bodily fluids, people spill drinks and drop things. You are better off with leather or vinyl shoes for a hospital IMO </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been really lucky to have a lot of awesome teachers but the one that stands out the most is my 8th grade honors US history teacher. 

She was the definition of 'firm but fair'; she made her expectations clear and expected students to meet and exceed them but she was willing to bend over backwards to make sure that everyone was able to perform up to their potential. 

I was going through a rough time and she was always there to support me and help me stay on track but she never lowered her expectations because she knew what I was capable of. She allowed me to struggle and fail and showed me that I could work hard and doing poorly on one test wasn't the end of the world and one bad grade didn't mean I was dumb and unworthy. She truly made me feel valued and loved when I felt really alone in the world and she created a classroom environment where it was cool to be smart.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I moved into my first apartment this week! 

I struggle with anorexia and I feel like I made a lot of big strides this summer; I worked 40 hours a week and finally took responsibility for planning and preparing my own meals because I am a grown ass adult and its unfair to make my mom pack my lunches. I've gotten over my fear of cooking to a degree and I started lifting (I used to just do cardio) so I'm motivated to eat to fuel the gainz. I'm feeling ready to adult! 

I am a bit nervous as I am at a "borderline" weight, I feel fine and people keep telling me how great I look (I've gained muscle) but I know that if I lose a pound or 2 I could end up in medical trouble or just spiral back down into disorder but I have too much at stake to let that happen.  


Last semester I ended up in the hospital and I almost had to withdraw for treatment but I stuck it out and now I feel like I'm ready to fully live. 
I don't know what this rant is, but I'm proud of myself and I think I might be able to do this and I wanted to share with someone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really didn't really understand binging until I was in eating disorder treatment (I have anorexia) and met people who really struggled with this behavior. 

Binging isn't just eating something because it tastes good and then regretting it; I know people who would be so out of control they would binge on condiments or still frozen pizzas if they ran out of edible food mid binge. Its a compulsive behavior; people who binge don't enjoy it, they binge because they don't know what else to do to deal with whatever they are feeling when they are triggered.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have bulimia (I have anorexia with purging, so I don't binge), but I hope I can be helpful! I would say it was/is pretty bad, there have been times when I would purge everything I was made to eat.

When I want to purge I tell myself that I have to wait 10-15 minutes then I can do whatever I want. Purging is still an option so I don't have anxiety like I do when I can't purge, but I have to wait and usually once that time has passed I am engaged in something else or far enough removed from the emotion of eating to be more rational. 

I have been to treatment many times; inpatient, residential, IOP, PHP and outpatient and I really recommend seeking a higher level of care if you think that it would be helpful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happened to my sister (though her having a physical illness was never taken off the table), and her doctors weren't asshats like the ones your poor sister got stuck with. 

I can't really blame the doctors though (in her case); they are trained to look for the most likely solution and when you have a teenage girl who is quickly losing weight and has a sibling (me) with a diagnosed eating disorder its not an unreasonable diagnosis to make especially when most likely medical conditions have been ruled out.  

Eating disorders can cause gastroparesis and GI conditions can trigger eating disorders (I had several friends in treatment who had eating disorders that developed as a way to feel "in control" of their medical condition) which makes this messy. They should have ruled out an ED at some point; but by having her talk to a therapist to make sure her thoughts weren't disordered, not by torturing her with treatment that she didn't want or need.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do think that content based tests are a fair way to assess people and I say that as someone with severe test anxiety. The fact is, testing works for the vast majority of people and there is no way to have something that is ideal for every single person. 

Most state schools that I applied to didn't really seem to care about the SAT and ACT unless your score was extremely above or below average. I know a few people who were probably offered a few more scholarship dollars because of their excellent scores but I don't know anyone who was hurt by their average scores if they were an otherwise desirable candidate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do agree that there are a lot of issues with out current system of standardized testing; we start testing too young and it is complete bull that teacher pay can be linked to scores, but I also think that people get WAY too bent out of shape about it. 

Test scores don't really mean much in college admissions unless you are trying to get into an Ivy. Excellent scores may help you a little or get you some money, but you have to do really terrible to be hurt by your SAT score if the rest of your transcript is ok.  </TEXT>

This is something a therapist said to me about creating a support network. Basically, no one person is equipped to fulfill all of your needs, a person may have a lot of useful things to offer you but if they are not equipped to give you what you need in a moment it is unfair of you to expect them to provide you with something that they don't have.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we as a society are losing our ability to tolerate any kind of physical or emotional discomfort and that really worries me. I hate it when people say that my generation is "soft" but I really do think that we as a society need to learn to suck it up sometimes because life isn't always fun or completely in line with how we want things to be.  

Sometimes, life is uncomfortable; we all have to do boring things, deal with annoying people and do things that we just don't want to do. It is completely ok to have feelings of discomfort but they are something that we need to learn to accept as a temporary part of life that we just have to deal with.

Try to see food as a neutral thing; if you are not in a place to enjoy it just think of it as something that has to be done at certain times. Schedule times to eat and stick to them. Go for things that are nutrient dense so that you can eat a smaller volume and still get a decent number of calories.
 
I would also recommend drinking some of your calories; ideally you should drink things that also have nutrients (lowfat milk, smoothies, protein shakes), but if all you can stomach is juice or a can of pop that is better than nothing.

	<TEXT> My eating disorder. I've struggled with anorexia since I was 13 (though I had disordered thoughts and behaviors from a much younger age) and I'm so scared that I will never be able to fully recover.

Right now I'm doing well enough medically that nobody is forcing treatment, but my thoughts are still super disordered and in reality I'm a bad week away from being back in a hospital bed. 

I have SO many great things going on in my life right now and my eating disorder has the potential to ruin everything, but I am so scared to do the things I need to do to get to a healthier place. I can't just drop everything and go to treatment but at a certain level I know that I can't do this on my own.
