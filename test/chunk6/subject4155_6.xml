	<TEXT> Yeah I love a) the mountability.. i use a docking system that mounts them nicely. B) the grain and colour.. not being paper seams to change how i draw... and c) i can work on them anywhere, hang with partner in lounge etc instead of being isolated in the studio (familiy/work/art balance is hard)  </TEXT>
