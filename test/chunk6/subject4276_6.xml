	<TEXT> Oh they shouldn't? You're the arbiter of how dumb should make me feel? Oh wise sage, how should I react to these morons who think the edge of the earth is under constant patrol. And also deny any evidence that is provided to them while at the same time providing none. Is it stoked, i bet I should be stoked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I think that most of this comes from people trying to use scientific equipment without actual knowledge of how to actually use this equipment. I said a similar thing in the last video about how they claimed the light side of the moon was cooler than the dark side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> first of all, any so called scientific article that starts off by bombarding me with ads I'm immediately skeptical of. Second, I'm not well versed in gravity but I educated myself enough to know that the writer of this article could benefit from the same education simply by youtubing "how does gravity work" and that's at least most of the questions the author ask answered right there.  </TEXT>
