	<TEXT> Wow, thank you very much, I want to start seeing my options, so I'm visiting all the websites you are giving me to see if I get something clear. I haven't though of a place, I speak both English and French, but my highest degree is the English one (c1, ISE III). 

I would love to live near the sea or lakes, even in an island, but I rather try any destination where they can offer me a good job. :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Routine help] How can I improve my routine? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-30 23:39:09 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hello,
I'm really confused after my break out a few months ago, and I have several issues, please, I need advise because I want to improve my routine.
I am 31 years old, female and I have oily skin, very sensitive and with some acne problems. Mild, but they are there. My main concerns are that almost anything breaks me out and that I have some strange red pimples in my nose that don't get rid with anything (I have a dermatologist appointment for that in January), so until then I'm on my own... I have some sleeping problems too and I have dark circles due to that and tiny fine lines under my eyes (I bought a Naruko eye cream with Vitamin K and niamicine that is arriving next month. Also I have tiny clogged pores that I can't figure out how to remove...
My main problem with products is that I can't find a way to properly remove my makeup. I tried the cleansing oil method, and that was the only time that I felt my face was clean enough, but it broke me out so badly. Now I'm dealing with pih, so I bought "Sr Skincare Vitamin C serum" that is arriving next week.
I would like to add some retinol, but I can't find any here. I have Epiduo but I don't know if is good to apply it all over my face... Also, I really need a moisturizer, I've bought several: Korres pomegranate, Mizon snail steam cream, Tonymoly pore control... But they all seems to break me out. I don't know for sure just afraid to use moisturizer.
My current routine is:

AM:

* Wash my face with Kiehl's calendula deep cleansing foaming face wash.
* Apply Naruko Tea Tree sunscreen
* Sometimes apply Clarins ever matte foundation

PM:

* Remove make up with Comodynes for sensitive skin.
* Wash my face with Kiehl's calendula deep cleansing foaming face wash.
* Wash my face with Sebamed Soap and a konjac sponge.
* Apply Neostrata gel plus salicylic - let it for 20 min.
* Apply Mizon Snail steam cream on my eyes and some vaseline over it.

Sometimes:

* Klairs supple preparation toner. (that's the further I go with moisturizing)
* Rosehip oil (like once a week).
* Aztec clay bentonite mask with apple cider vinegar once a week.
* Apply Cosrx acne pimple pad on the whitehead.
* Apply Epiduo on the closed comedones.

Apart from that I take Vitamin D3 and Zinc supplements everyday.
Can you evaluate my routine and tell me how to improve it? It would be super helpful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been dealing with eating disorders and obesity for a long time. Since last year I've changed my way of eating, I definitely feel much better, with energy, and even my blood panels look better. Today, talking about it with a friend, he said that changing how I eat won't improve my health in general, that an oncologist who treated his brother told him that you would have to wait 20 years of imrpovement of your eating to see any significant change, that his brother asked his oncologist: "Do I have to eat better?" and he answered: "Why? You already have cancer..." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow! I'm so impressed, really. I'm a skincare products junkie too :) but when it becomes to makeup I'm a complete desaster. My dark circles are pretty recent, I've been suffering insomnia for 15 years now (I'm 31) and now starts to become quite noticeable... I bought my first concealer and concealer brush about three months ago. I don't know the exact name but is a compact circle of MAC. The thing is that the MAC girl gave me a shade that is not exactly my skintone (I watched the tutorial you gave me and she says it has to be your exact skintone I think). No matter what I do is quite noticeable and I still clearly see my dark circles unless I put tons of layers letting them dry between one and another, is that normal? lol. You must thing I'm the rookiest make up user in the world lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was reading some blogs about how to get rid of dark circles and I came across [this](http://www.mariefranceasia.com/beauty/beauty-sos/killer-question-getting-rid-dark-circles-18986.html) blog which claims that arnica cream, (specifically Cicabio Arnica by Bioderma) can be useful to get rid of dark circles. Later I went to a pharmacy and the assistant told me that she has several customers that use it that way. I haven't tried, I wanted to know if you may have some information about it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Suggestion for my acne scars? Vitamin c? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-20 18:53:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello,

I've been dealing with a very bad acne breakout for the most part of the year. Now, it seems to be under control, with just an occasional pimple, but the aftermath of my face is a disaster, and honestly, I'm a little bit depressed with all the scars I have, specially because I'm 31yo now and my face doesn't heal like before and I have deep and enlarged marks and hyperpigmentation. I'm so afraid of breaking out again that I hardly use anything in my face, so it starts to be dry and in very bad shape. I was thinking about using a vitamin c serum, and some moisturizer, but it seems that anything breaks me out. I know many products have different reactions in different people, but I would like to know if vitamin c can break me out too, I was thinking about buying C E Ferulic but is quite expensive and I can't afford to waste more money in things that break me out. I'm also thinking in a long term laser treatment, do you have any suggestion?

My current routine is:

AM
-Wash my face with Sebamed Soap.
-Naruko Tea Tree Oil Sunscreen.
-Sometimes Clarins Ever Matte Foundation.

PM
-Sesderma Hidraven Make-up remover toilettes.
-Sebamed soap.
-Kiehl's calendula deep cleansing foaming face wash
-Neostrata Salicilic Gel Forte 15 AHA
-Klairs preparation supple tonic
-Tea tree oil and BP in the pimples.
-Corsx Acne Pimple Paster Patch in the whiteheads or cysts if any.
