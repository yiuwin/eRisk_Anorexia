	<TEXT> Hijacking top thread for this.
According to the "assault weapons" ban in several northern states the criteria for being an assault weapon are:

Semi-automatic rifles able to accept detachable magazines and two or more of the following:
-Folding or telescoping stock
-Pistol grip
-Bayonet mount
-Flash suppressor, or threaded barrel designed to accommodate one
-Grenade launcher mount

Let's dissect this for a second. I own an AR-15. I live in a state with more lenient gun laws. My AR-15 is semi-automatic and it came with a flash suppressor and a telescoping stock. My stock moves back and forth ~3 inches. The flash suppressor is screwed on the threaded barrel. This gun is illegal in northern states and qualifies as an "assault weapon". I can do 2 things. I can change my stock out to not move and I can have my flash suppressor pinned and welded to the gun. This gun would function the same. It shoots the same, it works the same, it shoots the same, but somehow this is considered an assault weapon. These liberal "common sense" laws have diverged into arbitrarily determining what is dangerous.

The second point is that there are firearms banned by make and model. This is the most insane thing to me. For example in New Jersey there's about 30 guns banned by MAKE. This is equivalent to banning Fords because of the name Ford. I assembled my AR-15, it's not a Colt. I can buy and assemble parts to make my AR-15 nearly identical to Colt's AR-15. Do people really think the company that manufactures the gun makes a difference?

I'm Catholic and I visit here often because you guys usually make compelling arguments for all of the topics discussed. I like learning about what the other side has to say, but quite frankly the Trump hate in these subs is detracting from what reddit is supposed to be. Pics, futurology, advice animals, atheism, these are all turning into hate Trump subs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just because it's not on the "federal sites" doesn't mean that all of the sudden lgbt communities lose their rights. Administrations post what their agenda is. They don't have to post a page about every single policy or viewpoint that they have. LGBT communities already have rights, it's not on Trump's agenda that's why it's not on the site. 

Again he's not "censoring" climate change. It's not part of his agenda so it's not on the site.

You know people can still work with LGBT communities and on climate change without it being on a White House website you do realize this right?

Edit: what do you mean they aren't on the "federal sites"? Do you know what NOAA is?

	<TEXT> I'm not saying the people's votes in California mean less, but that point was made because you said the right is an extreme minority. Only flipping 1 state would have changed the popular vote.

We are arguing the same point, but from 2 different angles.  California and NY have very large EC votes which is the exact opposite of ignoring their vote because they all live in one place. 

The popular vote would result in a democratic president every single election from here on out. I'm not against that just because I don't vote that way, but you turn the American system into one of an authoritarian oligarchy. The democrats could literally pick the president every single time. They could choose their candidate, give them the super delegates, and they would be elected because of the vote disparity. I'm sure we can both agree this isn't better than what we have now and that's why the EC is an integral part of the U.S. voting system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First I do agree that they would have a large impact, however you and everyone who makes that same argument fail to realize is that the internet is a thing.

Ok you make this point then you don't explain why it matters.  So just because something was made in the time with no internet that means it is wrong?  I don't understand what the internet has to do with anything.

And sure, it's true that the current republican party likely wouldn't be able to win in regards to a equal voting system, but I raise the question: If they can't win like that why are we letting that extreme a minority run things?

Extreme minority? If California wasn't counted Trump won the popular vote.  Its not an extreme minority.

Since before I was born the right has been farther and farther gone off into the deep end of wacko crazy.
Right, lets not talk about the crazy SJWs and identity politics that the left plays.

Let's look at the definition of classical liberalism.
Classical liberalism is a political ideology that values the freedom of individuals  including the freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and markets  as well as limited government.

So liberals went from freedoms and rights to oppressing people who have different opinions they do.  They claim to be tolerant **BUT SEND DEATH THREATS TO A 16 YEAR OLD GIRL WHO AGREED TO PERFORM AT THE INAUGURATION**. Oh so very tolerant.  I am sorry, but the left has skidded off the rails much farther than the right has.  The left plays this "minority olympics game" where there is a hierarchy of who is the biggest minority and who can we use to our political agenda the most.  You can be gay, you can be black and those are totally awesome.  However if that same black gay person is a Trump supporter than they are no good.  The left creates this world where everyone is good except the evil right.  Caitlyn Jenner was treated as a star and a great person by the left for coming out, until they found out she was a republican.  Then they couldn't use her anymore so she is a bad person now.  Give me a break.  If you do not notice any of this then you are completely blind.

I don't know what the solution is.  Maybe some sort of EC without the winner take all voting system.

One of those jobs, by the way, was preventing someone like Trump from becoming president. 
  Trump hasn't done anything to not be qualified as president.  Sure he said some mean things, but maybe if we all had tougher skin then it wouldn't be a problem.  Obama was a first term senator.  He had no experience.  He voted on other people's bills for 2 years before becoming president.  So what is a qualified president?  Someone that has a law degree?  Any hack lawyer can become president just because the practice law?  Weren't the Clinton's disbarred?

	<TEXT> People's votes matter. This is a straw man argument I see all the time. Trump won a few states by less than 40,000 IIRC. That isn't that many people. Getting rid of the winner take all in states would make sense, except who's going to divide the state's up? The gerrymandering would intensify and it may get worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From politifact:

A few weeks before they left the White House, the Clintons were able to muster a cash down payment of $855,000 and secure a $1.995 million mortgage. This hardly fits the common meaning of "dead broke."

We rate the claim Mostly False.

	<TEXT> No no of course the whole country gets to vote and obviously not everyone in CA and NY or the Midwest vote for the same person. However if we just went by the popular vote then the interests of those 12 states would be overshadowed by just 2 states. Not only that, but 2 coastal states would be the same as 12 rural states who probably have vastly different interests.

Listen I'm not trying to say the electoral college is perfect. Does it need to be tweaked? Probably. Does CA probably need more votes based on population? Probably. But if we got rid of the EC then smaller rural states would lose their sway in any election ever again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not because you are equating civil rights not being in America because of a website? It's chilling that you think since they removed this from a website that all civil rights are gone. You may not care for Trump, but the fear mongering is very abhorrent from the left. Just give it a chance. If any freedoms start being taken away from law-abiding citizens I will stand in protest with you, but until then just give the administration a shot. It hasn't been a day yet. </TEXT>

He didn't do shit.  All he did was create a healthcare system that doesn't work with 0 votes from the Republicans.  All his policies are executive actions that will be undone with the stroke of a pen.  He was an ineffective negotiator and all around a lame duck president for 8 years.   </TEXT>
