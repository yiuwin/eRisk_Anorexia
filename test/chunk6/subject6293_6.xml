	<TEXT> I understand that. I was looking for the quote when Ellie gave Joel the Picture, but I gave up. I don't understand why Joel is condemned to repeat the past even if he does remember it, and accepts it. It contradicts the text on the image, right?

Edit: I think I understand. He remembered what happened when he rescued Sarah, so instead of letting Marlene go [he killed her](/spoiler), unlike how he approached the soldier in the beginning of the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had so many frustrations with auto-rotation. I'm satisfied with Ultimate Rotation Control. To toggle rotation I use Swipe Pad shortcuts,  a lockscreen widget (had to enable all widgets for lockscreen) and a navbar widget. I'm also running aokp. 

Edit: Dude that was a great idea. The rotation app comes with rotation shortcuts and you can select a shortcut as an option for a navbar button. IT'S POSSIBLE.  </TEXT>

 Scrolling works with the Square and Full options, but not Portrait and Landscape.

Make sure you're using either Full or Square.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Custom icons - ms Paint 

Wallpaper - /u/jacko121 

Navigation bar - Softkeyz 

Launcher - Nova 

The play and next icons do exactly that: play/pause and next song. I used [Media Keys](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.cwfk.ig88.mediakeys) for this. 

It ended up being really similar to /u/TheElusivePinto 's submission, sorry about that. I did get the idea from his post.

	<TEXT> My Sony Vaio running Windows 8 would only show a black screen after the Vaio greeting screen. In order to fix this I refreshed it and now I can't access my C drive. I have all my important files backed up and I'm not afraid to lose anything. Also, I can't access my recovery options by pressing f8 during the startup like I usually would. Almost exactly the same problem as this unlucky fella http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-1661593/access-drive-download-files-refresh.html </TEXT>
