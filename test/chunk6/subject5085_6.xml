	<TEXT>  Just because she is a vet doesn't mean she can do wesen surgery. Rosalee already fills that role.

Of course it doesn't necessarily mean that, but that seemed like a clear possible role for her even before Rosalee was introduced.

 I think if she just joined the team she have been bland and boring.

The character was given nothing to do in the story (other than be the bland, boring, nagging girlfriend or the confused/memory-loss-tastic girlfriend) up until the Hexenbiest thing. If anything, her becoming evil was way more tropey than my suggestion. </TEXT>

    comment: |
        Hi! thank you for your submission to /r/subreddit. Please remember to flair your post.

        If you are on mobile and unable to flair it, please contact the moderators, and they can set a flair.

(optionally change `comment` to `message` to send a modmail, as he said)

Make sure `is_moderator: false` is on a separate line and indented with 4 extra spaces. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I assume OP is referring to their comments in /r/DCcomics being removed (their submission was not - well, aside from the original duplicate submission). Judging from context, I'm guessing it's because it's because of comments like this regarding a case of [blatant sexual harassment](http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/marinaomi-harassed-comics-panel):

 Saying inappropriate joke which he apologized for and never did it again, doesn't make someone a "perv".

Maybe the mods thought that their comments violated [rule 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/wiki/guidelines) there?

(I don't mean to rehash the issue or get into the argument here)

Anyway, OP, you'll have to send them a modmail to get a definitive answer to your question. Remember to be polite and patient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another fast-paced episode. Sunny, Bajie, and MK are finally back in the Badlands. Sunny uses Chau to help him get to the Widow (and hopefully to Veil) as Bajie breaks out with Sunny's help and follows them (unbeknownst to them). Then he turns on Chau's forces as the Widow promises to tell him where Veil is if he helps her. "I'm a woman of my word," she says. We all know how that worked out for Veil...

Meanwhile, Tilda's openly confronting the Widow about what she did to Veil... I suspect that conflict will come to a head soon.

Also, Lydia saves Veil from having to kill Quinn just in time, as she rushes in to report that Sunny is alive and has been seen with the Widow. Quinn's interactions with Veil just make me feel icky. I was really worried that something bad (well, worse) might happen to her.

(Not to mention, this episode killed off 2 Barons! And it's not even a season finale or something.)

All in all, a pretty great episode. I'm excited to see how the last 2 episodes of the season play out. </TEXT>

Technically, I believe Jade's still alive, though I'm not sure she's a Baron of much anymore.

Also, the other baron isn't unnamed; he's [Rojas](http://www.amc.com/shows/into-the-badlands/exclusives/the-world#territories-anchor). I think he survived the Conclave (he did support the Widow, after all). </TEXT>

 Just when you thought you knew Stephen Colbert, the newly appointed king of late-night comedy is about to offer a surprising look into his very soul. Shortly before he took over the reins for David Letterman on CBSs The Late Show, The Colbeard sat down with Father Thomas Rosica, media attach to the Holy See Press Office and CEO of Salt and Light Television based in Toronto, Canada, and poured his heart out about his job, his devout faith, and Pope Francis.

From the short clips linked in the article, I found the full interview linked in the sidebar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF5tudIqN7w

(I haven't watched it, but the article contains snippets of it)

Also, you can find other articles about him talking about his faith by just Googling `Colbert Catholicism`. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From /u/AngstChild's comments there:

 Some quick stats... I used the FCC's search function and found that 54K of the 518K results are using this same paragraph text (as of 5/9/2017 @3:30EST). So nearly 10% are fake and that number seems to be increasing faster than actual submissions by individuals. Definitely some bot at play here.

and

 More evidence of astroturfing. I found the following text was used by bots repeatedly (full list for visibility). Searches were conducted between 3:30-4:30pm EST. Will try to update later as well.

 **2,000** of these...  
 "Obamas Title II order has diminished broadband investment, stifled innovation, and left American consumers potentially on the hook for a new broadband tax. These regulations ended a decades-long bipartisan consensus that the Internet should be regulated through a light touch framework that worked better than anyone could have imagined and made the Internet what it is. For these reasons I urge you to fully repeal the Obama/Wheeler Internet regulations."

 **13,653** of these...  
 "I was outraged by the Obama/Wheeler FCC's decision to reclassify the Internet as a regulated "public utility" under a Depression-era law written for the old Ma Bell telephone monopoly. Government utility regulation of the Internet risks devastating private investment, undermining competition, and stalling innovation. It also puts consumers at serious risk of being hit with a new "broadband tax" to cover the lack of private sector investment due to these regulations. The liberal extremist groups that ginned up fake support for reclassification include the group Free Press, which was cited 62 times in the Title II order. Free Press was founded by ultraliberal college professor Robert McChesney who has admitted: "At the moment, the battle over network neutrality is not to completely eliminate the telephone and cable companies. We are not at that point yet. But the ultimate goal is to get rid of the media capitalists in the phone and cable companies and to divest them from control." Clearly, these extremists groups are openly hostile to America's free-market economy. The Trump/Pai FCC is right to revisit this issue. I urge you to stand up to the radical extremists who took over the FCC under Obama and protect our free-market Internet by rescinding the Title II order."

 **54,396** of these...  
 "Obamas Title II order has diminished broadband investment, stifled innovation, and left American consumers potentially on the hook for a new broadband tax. These regulations ended a decades-long bipartisan consensus that the Internet should be regulated through a light touch framework that worked better than anyone could have imagined and made the Internet what it is. For these reasons I urge you to fully repeal the Obama/Wheeler Internet regulations." </TEXT>

Ego killing Peter's mother had nothing to do with Peter having the celestial gene or not (as I said). He killed her because he loved her (or "loved"), but he had to return to his planet to avoid becoming mortal/losing his abilities and didn't want to be drawn back to Earth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree with the article's assessment about Buffy:

 But there are still weak points. Buffy is a terribly written and developed character. Although the actor who plays Buffy does a pretty good job, she can't overcome the insurmountable effect of poor writing. It's very difficult to believe that she's a great athlete, yet she hangs out with a bunch of misfits. And her encounters with Marty are overly adultified.

...as if athletes never hang out with anyone else. And it's not like kids are never sassy or mature. It just seems like a weird criticism to make. </TEXT>

 I made some changes to cut down on unspecific queries that run very slow and return many many links. One of these changes was to not execute queries less than 3 characters long.

 For your example query you could do "`title:q5 OR selftext:q5`" https://www.reddit.com/r/Audi/search?q=title%3Aq5+OR+selftext%3Aq5 restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all

 Sorry for the trouble.

	<TEXT> What an atrocious game. So many weak-ass turnovers, so few shots. They barely tried until the last few minutes of the game, scored 2 goals, and then let their foot off the gas again. Probably the most frustrating Pens game I've watched lately.

The Penguins need to figure their shit out, and come back hard in Game 7. </TEXT>
