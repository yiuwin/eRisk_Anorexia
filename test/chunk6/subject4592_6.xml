	<TEXT> Same reason the stars twinkle.  
There is different and disturbed air in between and it's bending the light.  
As for what's causing the disturbance, it caused by the different heat of the surfaces.  
Ever see an image bendy and distorted on a particularly hot day over concrete or asphalt?  
That's because the man made surfaces are absorbing and releasing alot of heat. So the air above is disturbed.  
It's visible even in daylight because of the extreme heat, but when it's dark and far away you can get the same effect even when it's not so hot.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) CO2 levels like temperature need to be in a certain bound, if CO2 is good, then more CO2 is better and the Earth is best looking like Venus. We need CO2 at certain levels, too low and we freeze, too high and we bake, we're at the too high spot.    
2) Kindly give some evidence for that, I would like to see some legitimate sources with data and replication studies.   
3) Wow, pump a room full of CO2 crank up the heat to 50 degrees centigrade and see how well your plants fare.    
  
Really, if you convince a couple of people that your product doesn't have any negative externalizes, they'll get emotional, claim that any evidence is some elaborate conspiracy and act as your advertising for free.  
The point of all of this is that this is a simplistic hoax for the purpose of **greed**! </TEXT>

Regardless of what was causing the climate to change (it's humans BTW and the world is getting warmer on average), climate change will be fucking us over regardless, so we better make changes. It's already killing the Great Barrier Reef, causing hurricanes and screwing up food prices in the middle east for example.  
Even if there was no warming (there is on average) and the climate wasn't changing (it is), I for one am pretty psyched for terraforming this planet to make it better for human habitation. </TEXT>

Socialism means control of the means of production are own by the society as a whole and not an individual person.  
These things are not mutually exclusive.  
As long as the society does not have any leaders and owns the means of production it can be both.  
But good luck actually getting it to work that way.

[If they are deprived of the opportunity to learn sign language, they start to suffer from cognitive disabilities.](http://www.hearingreview.com/2016/02/study-revisits-sign-language-affects-cognitive-development-deaf-children/) Simply put, we need that voice in our head to organize our thoughts. Deaf people don't have a voice in their head, they have signing hands in their heads.  
[When a person who is born deaf become schizophrenic, instead of auditory hallucinations, they see disembodied hands signing to them.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0707/07070303)

	<TEXT> First of all Medicare, health and social security is 1.8 trillion.    
What you are saying is that with just that, without touching the Food Assistance, Unemployment, and anything else in the .65 Mandatory spending budget left over, without even involving a single cent in the discretionary spending budget, with the states each pitching in $0 to be able to dismantle their individual safety nets.
We can absolutely guarantee that absolutely every 4 person household in the United States is at the Federal Poverty level of $24,600 for a household of 4.   
So yeah, definitely a step in the right direction, but obviously you prefer a quasi-theocratic kleptocracy, so whatever floats your boat. </TEXT>

It's also an efficient replacement for the entire social safety net.  
You can go ahead and abolish HUD, Medicaid, Social Security, the minimum wage, the ACA, and many other government support programs without compromising standards of living. All of those were ways to give the poor money in order to live, just filtered through a bunch of bureaucratic hoops.

	<TEXT> I'm stealing this idea from another redditor, but...   
If your house gets struck by lightning and catches fire, you don't say "Oh that was caused by nature, so I'm doing nothing"  then watch your house burn down.
No, you put out the fire and install a lightning conductor so it doesn't happen again.   
So even if this warming is 100% all natural, it's still going to kill us all, so humanity should be working to reverse it.

	<TEXT> There are many ways a nuclear explosion can kill you, there's alot of overlap, but they tend to vary depending on how close you are or what type device was used.  
Close in, the nuclear explosion creates a fire ball, it's hotter than the surface of the sun. Burned to death really doesn't cover it, cremated still isn't enough, it's hot enough to turn your entire body to carbon from the heat and leave nothing but a dark layer of soot on the wall.    
Further out the light from the blast is still  strong enough to cook. Imagine putting your hand in a toaster, increase the strength of that until it can set things on fire.   
  
As all this burning is going on, the air is expanding rapidly because of all the heat. This results in a wall of wind going out at about the speed of sound.  
  
Close enough and this wind is like getting hit by a truck, and you get pulped.  
Further out and your lungs get damaged and you die.  
  
This wall of wind doesn't just pulp you, it damages building, weaker buildings collapse and you die from stuff falling on your head.  
  
Now lets step far away from the explosion and discuss one of the most incorrectly ridiculed bits of cold war civil defense education.  
You're standing in a home when you see a sudden flash of light. Most human's primitive ape brain are wired to go look for the new bright shiny thing. So you get up and go to the window to look for the bright shiny thing. Remember that blast wave I told you about earlier? That's travelling slower than light. It takes a few seconds to reach you, you took a few seconds to get to the window. The blastwave is pretty far out, but it's got enough force to break a glass window. You die from hundreds of glass daggers to the face. And this is why you Duck and Cover. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not alot of good ones.  
Some of the larger ships have [bow thrusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_thruster) so they might be able to cobble together some motion.  
They might have launches/runabouts and be able to tow themselves.  
  
Or they could go really old school and start [warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warping_\(sailing\)).  
IE find some way to get an anchor ahead of the ship and haul it back in again. </TEXT>

I never got why people waited until episode 3 to cry foul.  
It's more accurate to say "Anakin slaughtering children AGAIN"  
No one seem to care that he explicitly stated he killed children in episode 2. </TEXT>
