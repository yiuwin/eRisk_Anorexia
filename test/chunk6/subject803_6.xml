I don't think the general audience remembers KG Beast's name either (Anatoli Knyazev) - but they will remember that he was a villain.

They'll probably say something in the lines of, "isn't he dead" or "he looks exactly the same as that villain from Civil War" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can relate to that, but let's be pragmatic. How does a profit oriented studio react to a crew that didn't make Justice League do well, despite artistic achievements?

Unlike other movies, Justice League is in a cinematic universe.

As long as the movie is well received, there will be a sequel (even if it didn't do well financially) since the studio is able to predict the next movie's potential. BB was an amazing movie, but it only did 374 million internationally.

However, this didn't stop WB from releasing TDK, since they knew the positive reaction from BB would increase the box office.

The Dark Knight reached a billion internationally...

John Wick is another example, the first movie did 88 million, while the second did 158 million.

Mad Max won an Oscar but didn't do well (there are talks of a sequel though).

Edge of Tomorrow did horribly in the box office, but because of the surprisingly positive reactions from the general audience, they are planning a sequel.

On the other side of the spectrum is Ironman 3, which made 1.2 billion but was not looked at favourably. Even though the movie made gang busters, Marvel is hesitant of making another Ironman movie.

	<TEXT> People will believe that the shift in tone was part of a response to the backlash for BVS, when they were completely oblivious that it was all part of the plan the whole time.

I think it's a combination.

Terrio probably had plans for JL to have a different tone from the get go, but you are kidding yourself if you think BvS's reaction didn't change JL.

This is what Terrio said in his interview with [WSJ](http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/03/11/inside-chris-terrios-vision-for-batman-superman-and-justice-league/)

*I initially thought I wasnt the guy to do Justice League and went off to work on something else. But the first day I went to the set, I saw Jesse [Eisenberg] in a scene with Holly Hunter and I really did feel like I was watching some strange, great performance in an independent film.*

*At that moment, I thought, Im not done with this yet. I want to go back and keep telling the story. Batman v Superman is a bit of an Empire Strikes Back or Two Towers or any similar middle film in a trilogy. The middle film tends to be the darkest one. I do think from Man of Steel through Justice League, it is one saga really.*

*I expect Justice League will be tonally not quite as dark as Batman v Superman. From that point of view, I felt compelled to go back and try to lift us and myself into a different tonal place because I think when you write a darker film, sometimes you want to redeem it all a bit.*

March 11th (the date of the interview) is only 8 days before BvS's release in Mexico, it's not that crazy to assume WB already knew how the movie would be received by then.

What are you talking about?

You literally said you wanted a JL teaser where they show Knightmare Superman.

What do you expect people to think?

most important thing about the marketing is to get people talking

You want people talking about the right things, since Knightmare Superman is not going to be in the movie....it's futile to advertise him.

It builds hype.

It's extremely misleading.

It's also a bad marketing decision, unless they want a million articles of how Superman is now evil and works under Darkseid and another two million articles shredding WB and the DCEU for such a stupid decision.....

	<TEXT> It's the sceptics that could do with a brush up.

They're "skeptics" because they have a legitimate reason to be weary.

It will all depend on the movie's quality at the end of the day.

If it's a good movie, it will be lauded.

If the movie is not, well..... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well said. I think he can and still will live up to Ledger given the proper script and director, but it seems Reeves isnt to keen on the gangster look so thatll be another process

Hopefully Reeves and Affleck will breathe some life into the character and transform him into a memorable villain.

Leto is so talented, he's currently being wasted....I hope they use him well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> he got 10 minutes without a single complete scene. ALl he had was butchered up and music video loooking moments with one liners and random dialogue. How do you expect to connect with the character. The closest to a whole scene was in the extended cut and that was great even though it was about 75% of the entire scene.

I think that's a weird argument.

No matter how much time he had or if his scenes were butchered or not, I got to see his glorified cameo in the movie and I did not like it.

If you read my comment, I did not blame him....I blamed the writer/Director (Ayer).

[In TDK, I was mesmerised by the Joker in the short bank robbery scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqvbv-SB4bg)

If all we got of Ledger's Joker was that specific scene, I would still think that was a great Joker.

Furthermore, I'm extremely disappointed in the mannerisms Leto decided to use for the Joker.

[I was more captivated with a character in a shitty indie horror movie directed by a singer, than Leto the Oscar winning actor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfUzoRMSocs)

Did I mention how appalling his laugh is....

Everything about him is disappointing, from his relationship with Harley to his dialogue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Videolab's video was shit and intentionally misleading.

However, you do have to admit that Snyder's movies are slightly darker than usual.

[For example, this shot of Superman in the arctic with the sun shining](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/899208/images/o-MAN-OF-STEEL-TRAILER-facebook.jpg)

[In real life, the ice reflects the sun, turning everything bright](http://imgur.com/a/FsHxj)

BvS is extremely dark in certain scenes as well.

[Image 1](http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_720,w_1280/t_mp_quality/pgyn9fzdltbmx2qx7ot4/the-dawn-of-justice-highlights-to-batman-v-superman-trailer-362756.jpg)

Snyder prefers his movies to look like a comic book come to life with a lot of contrast and shadow. 

These shots are beautiful but dark and lack realism for many.....

	<TEXT> Before the release of SS, we were not doubting him.

We **knew** he was an amazing actor.

However, SS was disappointing and Leto wasn't exactly amazing.....which is why we're doubting him now.

He will always be an Oscar winning actor, but it all depends on the script and direction of the next DCEU movie he will be in. </TEXT>

...and BvS will?

I think Ironman 1, the Avengers, Winter Soldier, Civil War and the GOTG will all hold up in the future.

 I like Snyder's take on the DCEU tone, only he should be really careful with the screenplay and editing.

The "tone" is not enough, you're hand waving the most important parts of a film.

I thought MoS and BvS had some very carefully placed jokes that weren't forced.

Other than Perry and Alfred's one liners, I don't think I laughed in BvS. Obviously comedy is subjective - but I think Marvel have created a formula that works for them (I didn't like Doctor Strange's jokes though). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bale got stabbed with a small knife by Talia.

He got stabbed up close by a woman he trusted. Talia made sure to stab him between the plates.

Unlike Bale, who has a few vulnerable spots, Affleck's entire body is vulnerable to a knife/bullet attack.

Affleck was stabbed in the shoulder in relative ease.

He was lucky the thug shot him in the head, since his cowl has a metal plating. What would've happened if he was shot in the leg or torso.

And he got wrecked by dogs.

That was one of the first suits he wore as Batman. 

In TDK, he had very good armour.

	<TEXT> It's crazy how amateurish the Bat suit looks here compared to Afflecks suit!

Nolan focused on creating a realistic suit that could be useful in real life....while Affleck's suit looks great - it's far from realistic.

He got stabbed in the warehouse, which goes to show just how weak the armour is.

Chainmail like material isn't going to protect you from bullets or guns.

Not to mention the pure bruteness in Afflecks fighting style compared to the more fitness looking style here.

Baleman's fighting style is actually quite good.

[The Keysi fighting method (now called Defense Lab) is extremely dangerous and very practical.](https://youtu.be/i8DrYtDCjKI)

It doesn't look cool, but it's damn effective </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But a lot of people on this sub talk shit about Collider, which is well deserved and I agree with, but then not only do you go right back to watching their channel you also link their videos for other people to watch. I really don't get it.

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure the natural birth only gives the Kryptonian freedom - but the strength of their genes has something to do with their families.

Clark's family are from a long line of scientists, meaning their DNA is not predisposed to war/fighting.

Remember, all the natural birth does is allow the person to control their destiny, without a set life from birth.

Also, while it might've been Supes' first fight, he had access to his powers for a long time and could control it (the destroyed truck, the Oil Rig).

Faora was able to learn within a short period of time, which is why I see potential in her.

but even still Jor-El held his own against Zod on Kyrpton which isn't at all for a scientist like Jor-El.

I honestly feel Zod went easy on Jor-El as they were once acquaintances. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With that in mind, that would mean that Faora would be pretty equal in power to what Zod and Superman have displayed.

She was very strong.....she manhandled Supes.

If allowed to absorb the same amount of sunlight as Supes.....she would be 2-3 times stronger than Supes.

Atleast, that's what I think.

The House of El aren't warriors, but Scientists/Scholars.

	<TEXT> TIL that Faora is from one of the oldest and more elite families on Krypton.


Since Kryptonian hierarchy was based on your genetics, does it mean that if she was given enough time to get used to her powers....she would've been stronger than Zod **and** Superman? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A lot of the "lore" in the star wars universe that fans love was not even considered canon and made by fans.

I agree with you.

I consider this the movie's official lore, but not the actual movie.

I think Star Wars fans don't kid themselves about the movies. They know how to differentiate between official lore, fan made lore and the actual movies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've said this before and I'd say it again. The amount of thought gone into this film is unprecedented. They really did manage to ground comic lore into reality. Fucking A.

While I do agree with you, the majority of the info on this photo wasn't actually in the movie.

Of course there were bits and pieces, but nowhere near as informative.

This was the same for BvS - where the prequel comics, the Timeout guide and the Tech manual had amazing content that was not in the movie.
