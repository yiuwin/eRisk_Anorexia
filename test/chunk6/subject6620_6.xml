	<TEXT> Where's this from? I ask because it looks like it could be from this documentary series on Canadian high schools that I saw a trailer for on the CBC. If OP did find it from there it probably means they live in Canada. I can't imagine anyone outside of Canada would be interested in CBC's 6 part docu-series on Canadian schools. It would be interesting to see a fellow Canadian memer.

I mean me too thanks!  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This isn't exactly related to the meme economy but this is the only meme discussion sub I know so I thought I'd ask.

I've been sorting my memes just on folders in my phone. Unfortunately it's starting to take up a lot of my time. I was wondering if there was another way. An app or something that can read text off of images and sort them that way. 

I imagine an app where I can program a folder to automatically include all images with the words "dat", "boi", and "oh shit waddup" on them, for example.

	<DATE> 2016-10-02 04:00:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Someone should make an account where they go on an club penguin adventure and they screenshot the story and give us updates every week or so. Maybe if two people could go on and talk to each other you could have some nice dialogue. Or you could just talk to random people for some unscripted scenes. 

It doesn't have to be a continuing story (but that'd cool) it could just be a character who gets up to funny stuff and pulls pranks on the local penguins each week!

I think it'd be a nice way to spice up the sub. 

Every week I'd check the sub not only for funny people being banned, but also for the adventures of Mr Penguin or something.

Thoughts?

	<TEXT> Girls. I think it's pretty good. Most of the actual girls in the show are horrible spoiled pieces of shit who can't shut up about themselves. But that's what makes it funny. We all know a girl like Hannah in real life. Also the show is worth it just for Shosh, Adam, and Hannah's dad. 

And the first 3 seasons of TBBT are pretty good. It went downhill really fast though and the recent seasons especially deserve a lot of hate.  </TEXT>

Last year I liked the Romeo Section. The guy who makes it (I forget his name) has made 2 very similar shows (spy dramas that are almost too edgy for CBC) and I hear they're better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't watch many other CBC comedies so I dunno. But since you watch CBC you might have heard of this new comedy called 4 in the Morning. About 20-somethings staying up late. And it is so fucking awful I can't believe it. The title sequence is cool and the premise is kinda unique. But the show itself is so pretentious and the characters annoy me far more than Mr D. Whoever writes this show thinks they're more clever than they are. It calls itself magical realism or something but it's just bullshit. It's only had two episodes so far and I already hate it more than most bad shows on tv.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a lot of shows that do that on purpose. In the Canadian show Mr D (I actually kinda like it but I'm not sure if most people do, I wouldn't recommend it for everyone) The main character is such a complete idiot and never once shows any signs of growing as a person. Just a huge asshole all the way through. It makes me cringe a lot. But I still watch the show. 

Also Sam on iCarly is such an awful person. I hate all her jokes. But I stick around for Spencer. I can't believe they gave Sam of all people a spinoff with some other girl from Victorious.
