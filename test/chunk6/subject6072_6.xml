	<TEXT> Yes, thats true.  And fossil fuel sources come with massive costs of their own, I cited above.  The point is you're missing costs on both sides, fossil fuels for all the damage they do and renewables for variability (and it would be impossible to account for either in an LCOE).

LCOE is still a valid if inperfect comparison.  If you're analyzing price, you can furthermore analyze variability separately afterwards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Germany's electricity prices rose initially about 30%, but [they've been stable since 2013](https://www.statista.com/statistics/418078/electricity-prices-for-households-in-germany/) while their grid has got increasungly clean over that period.

Like I said before, you do need consistent energy.  But that can absolutely come in forms other than natural gas or coal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually a lot closer than you think!

Here is [Lazards Storage 1.0](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-storage-analysis-10/) analysis.  Here is their [2.0 Analysis a year later](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-storage-analysis-20/).  2 things to note.

1) Lithium ion went down from 347-739 to 267-561.  Thats a massive drop for one year.

2) More importantly, lithium ion is approaching the cost levels of pumped hydro and compressed air.  Those sources are already cheap enough to be somewhat widely used.  So my guess is big storage could be a as little as 2 years away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the Wikipedia page [on this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources?wprov=sfla1).  

Wind's footprint is roughly 2% of the footprint of natural gas, little over 1% of coal.  Solar is a little more, but still far better.

Part of this is also a chicken and egg problem.  Takes electricity to make them, electricity that comes from coal/natural gas.  But until we make them, electricity has to come from coal/natural gas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With that being said, take a look at [EIA LCOE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source?wprov=sfla1) or [Lazard LCOE](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-analysis-100/).  Renewables are fully competitive with natural gas today, even with absolutely no subsidies.

I do agree, fossil fuels are a neccesity right now, its only realistic.  But I think what gets lost is the additional [costs of not acting as well](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21605936-scorched-farms-flooded-homes-and-lower-productivity-cost-doing-nothing).

You're right.  Higher electricity prices have their consequences.  But it has been shown that [not acting probably has more](http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/reduce-emissions/economics-climate-factsheet.html#.WPRqsCIanqA).  Its more than just environmental factors, thats the fundamental misconception.  Its economic and health factors.

Coal is estimated to cost [roughly $500 Billion annually](https://www.fastcompany.com/1727949/coal-costs-us-500-billion-annually-health-economic-environmental-impacts) in health, economic, and environmental costs in the US alone.  Natural gas is better, but not good enough.  Its about 50% cleaner, so it will still cost a very substantial amount.

It would also be very inaccurate to say you need LNG/lignite for when the winds not blowing.  Many countries actually already use no or almost no fossil fuels ([Sweden is a good example](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Sweden?wprov=sfla1)).  There are lots of alternatives other than natural gas or coal, primarily nuclear but hydropower and associated storage works very well too in certain places, like Costa Rica.  

EDIT: I should add I think you made good points.  Just trying to add additional context. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, first things first: **fucking brutal**.  It caused me pain to watch them play.  I've seen junior high teams with more poise and grace.

But some notes:

- Kyle Lowry didn't look like himself.  Can't help but wonder if the flu-like symptoms aren't bothering him.

- Its not all Caseys fault.  But it is a little.    Guys weren't hitting shots.  Casey can't fix that.  But how do Kyle and Cory combine for 60 minutes and 7 points, and not even give Delon a try?  Could he do anything worse?  Probably my biggest pet peeve with Casey, when somethings not working, he doesn't adjust.  But its not the reason we lost.

- DeRozan looked okay, but he can't haul this offense all by himself.  By the 4th quarter, the Bucks basically stopped guarding everyone else.

- We need more than 4 from Lowry.  All there is to it.

- At the end of the day, the issue is right here: 36/22/73.  Its really that simple.

I'm not trying to shoot down the idea.  But its uncharted territory, and it comes with a lot of question marks.

I would much rather start by decriminalizing drugs, legalizing weed and then working from there.  Probably legalize shrooms next.  But analyze every step of the way.  

Suddenly and instantly legalizing all drugs would be a radical and questionable change.  Instead, lets try careful, gradual change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yet, that S-Class owner did buy a Tesla.  And liked it.  But most S-Class owners probably wouldn't buy a Tesla.  They're marketed and designed to far different crowds.

Both tests scored Tesla better?  Thats not even arguable.  Go look at them.  The one actually called the S-Class system a total disaster, not even close to Autopilot.

I think most people would agree the S Class interior is better.  But how can you stick your head in the sand about all of the advantages of a Tesla?  Far better autonomous driving?  Faster acceleration?  Those two are really unarguable.  Not everyone places interior aesthetics above all like you do.

For what reason do you think tens of thousands of people are spending comparable money on a Tesla if its a way worse vehicle? Just cause? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It appears you hate Tesla so much you just might be blind.

No, not particuarly.  Most people would say a 400 to 540 Km range is enough to do what they want, including myself.  So what does "more range" mean at that point?  To me, very little.  Having more provides no real advantage.  

[Here is a Tesla and Mercedes S owner comparing the two](https://forums.tesla.com/en_CA/forum/forums/tesla-s85-vs-mercedes-s550).  He gives edges to both (Tesla: technology, noise, acceleration, speed.  Mercedes: luxury, comfort, ease of entering).

Here is a comparison of [their self-driving](http://www.caranddriver.com/features/semi-autonomous-cars-compared-tesla-vs-bmw-mercedes-and-infiniti-feature-the-physiology-of-semi-autonomy-and-test-results-page-6) from Car and Driver.  It was actually a  $250,000 Mercedes S vs a $136,000 Tesla, so hardly a fair test but Tesla scored better anyways.

Another comparison of their autonomous driving [that says Teslas is far more advanced and superior](http://www.thedrive.com/tech/4591/the-war-for-autonomous-driving-2017-mercedes-benz-e-class-vs-2017-tesla-model-s).  

This comparison from [US News](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/compare?trims=12593-364388_12617-366454) has them very comparable.  9.6 critic rating for the S-Class, 9.5 for the Tesla.

I really can't see how you can pretend the Mercedes is a far better, clearly superior car.  Both have advantages and disadvantages.  Not saying the Tesla is objectively *better*, but comparable?  Absolutely.

To say that a Model S compares to a 3-Series...well thats laughable.  And I say that as someone thats owned two 3-Series, and that loves it.  But the Model S is in another league.  Pretty much every 3-Series owner I know would prefer a Model S. </TEXT>

Relevant quote: "It's the moving parts in a regular gasoline or diesel engine that tend to fail over time and can include anything from the pistons to the belts. The great advantage of an electric car engine is that it has no moving parts so these cannot actually fail.".  

Now it does note that other parts of EV's can fail, and that's true, but it'll take some more time to see how severe these issues look like.  But overall it very much looks like EV's should be considerably more reliable.  Sadly, we just haven't had enough EV's on the road yet to get a good subset of data so I'll be looking forward to some bigger sample sizes to look at.  They may face some issues in the beginning as the technology is still young and more break-prone, but in the long run I definitely think they'll prove to be far more reliable.   </TEXT>

Just to be clear, what do you mean by distribution?  Like, just regular power lines?

Thanks for the advice!  I'll contact them to see if I can get some information.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's fairly [well established](http://insideevs.com/consumer-reports-electric-vehicle-reliability-general-electric-cars-stellar/).  

Electric engines are far simpler than combustion engines, which means less breaks and easier fixes.  

Even Tesla had some reliability issues in their early days, but they still scored well in the "electrified" parts of the vehicle.  More to do with squeaks, door handles, and issues like that, not related to the electric engine.

Of course that's on top of less maintenance to begin with. </TEXT>

How do I tell if a line is a 3-phase?

I [found this](http://powerforthefuture.ca/electricity-411/electricity-map/) map but the legend doesn't define 3 phase transmission line.  Is a 230+ kV system the same as a 3 - phase transmission line?

Thanks so much for the help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, its a tough issue.  They do need a method of enforcement that actually works.  At the same time, they need heavy oversight because too many of these private lots are known for doing unscrupulous things (I've seen it a couple times around my area in downtown Edmonton).

I think ticketing is probably the better way to go, but they need to be able to actually enforce the tickets then.  The reason I don't like boots is because if they do unfairly boot someone, that persons basically stuck.  Even if there was a way to appeal, it would probably take hours to days or longer.  Meanwhile, you lose use of your vehicle for that time and you have to find another means of transportation.

Either way, hopefully they actually deal with this and find a real solution. </TEXT>

You have to realize what the Tesla vehicles are.  They're luxury vehicles (so far at least).  The Model S doesn't compete against $25,000 Mazdas.  It competes against the BMW 7 Series, and for that it is very competitively priced.  The Model 3 competes against the 3 Series/A4/Mercedes C. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes and no.  The first thing to note is you're refering to long-haul semis.  Not all semis go such crazy distances, so my guess is you would start out with either semis used for short hauls or in yards (there are actually already some electric semis being used for this).

We'll see what range looks like, but electric semis also have big advantages.  Mainly, they are *way* cheaper to run.  So you can afford to spend more time stopped and charging if you can run the vehicle much cheaper.  That could let them get away with somewhat shorter ranges hopefully.

Anyhow, it will be an interesting expirment none the less.

Look, I think it was the wrong decision.  But to go into a flight knowing that your daughter needs hot food or she will have a meltdown while failing to give the airline an advanced warning is asking for trouble.  

The flight attendant handled the situation terribly.
