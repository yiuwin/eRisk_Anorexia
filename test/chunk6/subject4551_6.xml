	<TEXT> Although some will no doubt laugh,  at Championship level, despite being utterly ungainly with the ball at his feet, Lloyd Doyley at his best was terrific defensively. Quick, great tackling and decent in the air for someone who isn't a giant. He also absolutely worked his arse off, and improved in leaps and bounds under Rodgers and Malky.  </TEXT>

I guess because it makes moving a player easier if he's (usually) the only one in the deal - correct me if I'm wrong, but American sportsmen don't get a huge say, generally, if their club wants to move them on? 

As for the transfer window, it used to last all the way through to about April (in England at least) but I think it was introduced as a way of attempting to reduce clubs bringing in players at the last minute to attempt to win the league etc </TEXT>

They accepted offers to 3.5mn from Bristol City   QPR, but he turned them down because he wants to move to us. It's not clear if we've still got an offer on the table or not, and we're waiting for Palace to blink. He's out of contract in the summer. 

I think we could find a use for him as back up in the middle three behind Deeney, but I'm not sure he's the priority he was. Plus we've got way too many non-HG players as it is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. The question for the Pozzos is do they aim to keep Watford in the Prem, and feed the cash to allow Udinese to go for Europe, or let us attempt to get to Europe and just keep Udinese afloat. I think you can make an argument that they're much more likely to be able to get into  Europe from Serie A.

There's also the issue of whether or not the fact that Giampaolo is owner of Udinese   Gino of Watford (formally) circumvents that rule. I'm not sure it does.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Teams we hate in no particular order: QPR, Luton, Crystal Palace
Players we love (retired): Luther Blissett (all time top scorer) Heidar Helgusson, Tommy Mooney, Nigel Gibbs, John Barnes
Players we particularly love (still going): Lloyd Doyley, Troy Deeney, Tom Cleverley (might just be me) Fernando Forestieri, Craig Cathcart, Almen Abdi, Odion "Gooooooooooooal" Ighalo

All time greatest manager: Graham Taylor; took us from the fourth division (now league 2) to second in the first division (Premier League) in seven seasons; an FA Cup final; Europe. Came back 12 years later and took us from Division 2 (league 1) straight through to the Premier League; finally won at Wembley in the 98/99 Play Off Final. 

History; we've only played in yellow since the 60s. Prior to that a variety of kits had been worn, including blue and black   white (which was worn at the start of WW1; it's why the season's away shirt is black   white stripes)

Previously known as: the blues (guess why) and the brewers (due to the clubs links with the now defunct Benskin's Brewery. 

Great choice of team, fella.  </TEXT>

1. No real expansionist aims
2. Although Blue Division soldiers had fought for Hitler, Spain never formally entered the war
3. In the context of growing distrust   hostility with Russia, Franco's anti-communism was seen as a Very Good Thing. Especially as the Republican forces had been backed by Stalin which had facilitated the growth of the Spanish Communist Party during the Civil War.
