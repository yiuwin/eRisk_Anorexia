Hi /r/MechanicalKeyboards,

Welcome to my Australian HHKB group buy Interest Check post :)


Here's my current plan:

1:You send me your order for any HHKB from PFU Fujitsu's website.

2:I place the order with PFU Fujitsu

3:I get order shipped to a shipping proxy

4:Proxy receives order and ships to me (in Melbourne)

5:Once I receive order from proxy, I ship via AusPost regular mail

6:You receive your brand new HHKB


How will this work?

I will be ordering directly from PFU Fujitsu and shipping to Australia using http://tenso.com/en,
The more people that order the lower the overall shipping cost to get the Keyboards from Australia will be. For example One keyboard cost roughly 3000 yen to ship from Japan to Australia via tenso, but 2 Keyboards costs 4000 yen(2000 yen per person (23.00 Aud)), 3 costs 5000 (1666 per person(19.00 Aud))etc... But if 20 boards are ordered, the shipping cost is 19550 yen (roughly 1000 yen per person (11.50 Aud)). When the boards are in Australia, the auspost shipping cost is roughly $15-20 Aud bringing the total cost up to $25-43 Aud.

What boards will be available?
The complete selection of boards can be found here: http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/direct/hhkb/


But here's a basic list of what boards will be available:

HHKB Pro 2 English. Black or White. Blank or Printed caps

HHKB Pro 2 Japan. Black or white. Printed caps

HHKB Pro 2 Type-S English. White. Blank or Printed caps

HHKB Pro 2 Type-S Japan. White. Printed caps

HHKB Pro 2 Bluetooth English. Black. Blank or Printed caps

HHKB Pro 2 Bluetooth Japan. Black. Printed caps



If you have any questions, please feel free to leave them.

Thanks

	<TITLE> Beginner wanting to start collecting Japanese cards </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-29 14:58:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi /r/PKMNTCG,

I am a 15 year old from Melbourne, Australia that would like to start collecting Pokemon cards (again).
The last time I collected Pokemon cards would have been 2009 (7 years old), I only bought offical cards, but unfortunately all the kids at my school only bought $2 shop fakes so I lost interest, but recently my younger brother got a couple Evolutions booster packs and I thought that it would be nice to get back into this hobby now that I am older (and have a bit more money). This time round I am wanting to collect Japanese cards, but I know nothing about them so I need some help from you guys:

1. What booster packs/boxes would you recommend that I buy (moneys not really an issue(+ I have a debit card so I can buy online if necessary))?
2. What sleeves/albums/portfolios/other collection supplies would you recommend that I start off with?
3. How do I find people to trade with (preferably in Australia, but world-wide is fine)?


Thanks
