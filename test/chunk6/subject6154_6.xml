	<TEXT>  Are there any duplicates with entries for the same column

If I'm understanding you correctly; no. Each film has a unique 'rank' for each respective list/column. 

These instructions seem complicated, but I *think* I understand what you're suggesting - will give it a go a bit later, and report back. 

Don't suppose you know of any quick way to eliminate all duplicates rows on that "Uniques" sheet? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a bit out of my Excel-depth on this one - and was hoping Reddit might be able to help. I'm attempting to merge 11 separate data sets (in this case, lists of 'best movies') - into a weighted masterlist without duplicates. 

There are over 2,500 lines total, but only half of those are unique entries. I can't really describe it well, so [here's what I have now](http://i.imgur.com/J2C6nt2.png) - and [what I'm trying to create](http://i.imgur.com/nYZ4bT9.png).

Not sure if there's any quick formula to solve this, but perhaps a macro or some complicated if/and equation? Hopefully you can point me in the right direction. Thanks, all.

	<TEXT> 10 years ago, maybe. The actor they get play Bond needs to be a company man, someone capable of playing the role for 5+ movies over 10+ years. Elba is already 44, and Craig hasn't even officially left the franchise yet. 

I hope they go with someone young and relatively unknown - the franchise doesn't need star power. Elba would however be great in some period crime film though. Playing a London mob boss during the 19th century or something?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The great thing about words, and their respective definitions is that they don't really care what they mean "to you" :-)

* ad hominem

 *(of an argument or reaction) directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining.*

It **WAS** an ad hominem attack. Irrelevant to the conversation, and uncalled for it. Let's move on.

 *why is there such a divide over people who see value in 
networks and those who don't?*

I don't think there is. SugiStyle is personally, and financially benefiting from his article thanks to his many referral links. **He sees a "value" in MCNs because they make him money when OTHERS sign-up.** Unfortunately, he's too stupid to recuse himself of this obvious conflict of interest.

 *And I'd like to ask, is there any value to joining a network today?*

Yes, certainly - but as I've argued many times on this SubReddit and others - the 'value' earned is RARELY worth more than the revenue-percentage you forfeit. There isn't a single music library or 'thumbnail help' worth 30% of income. Which is why it's important to negotiate, and figure out the best deal for your channel. 

I've signed on to MCNs in the past because the contract WAS FAVORABLE TO ME. Most of the 'default' options Sugi lists in his shitty article are not. They are overtly predatory, and offer few tangible benefits or guarantees to their partners.  </TEXT>

**you're*

 you had 10 years to work on a channel

That's actually the entire reason for the low-conversion rate in the first place: my channel's age. All 2006-channels are feeling similar affects. Again, not sure how my own personal viewership is relevant to a conversation about MCNs in the fucking slightest, but keep digging your hole deeper.

Owning a CMS-level account is not a conflict of interest here. Do you even understand what that concept means? Hahah, obviously not. If anything, it gives me a more unique and knowledable perspective on the situation, as I'm familiar with the toolset and advantages of both environments. 

 its not like i have referral links to all networks out there

What?! Hahahah! You really are fucking dumb, aren't you? I don't care if it's one link or twenty. You are advocating the benefits of MCNs so you can personally benefit from someone's sign-up - that is the TEXTBOOK definition of a conflict of interest, you obtuse fool.

* conflict of interest
noun

* a situation in which a person is in a position to derive personal benefit from actions or decisions made in their official capacity.* </TEXT>
