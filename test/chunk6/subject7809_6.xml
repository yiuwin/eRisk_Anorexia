	<TEXT> He tends to make a bad case for the community occasionally. Case in point, when he was explaining why marijuana can lead to flashbacks. THC has this potential because it affects the same serotonin/dopamine receptors that shrooms/LSD does. If the pathway is built through frequent trips, weed at high enough doses will be able to activate the same path. He described this simply and wrongly as a "door that is now open" in your mind. Giving vague New Age-esque answers like this discredits his good work. Also he stresses the importance of set and setting (and rightfully so) but in all his reports rarely seems to take it seriously himself. I guess he is a good cautionary tale and shows one can survive such experiences intact, but I also wish a voice as strong as his (he is getting quite popular) would attest to the fact that bad trips are extremely unlikely if one actually takes care of their set and setting.  </TEXT>
