	<TEXT> You should! Its not like Season 9 anymore (like where it was Game-Game-Break-Game-Break-Game-Break-Game-Break-Credits; That was horrendous!)

Aisha has toned down and become quite relaxed, Banter is ever present now, The guys have been finding ways to rag and tease Aisha. Seeing Good Chemistry all around. Different games have been thrown into the mix too. (They've started to really bring back some older games that were gems from the early US run and UK run) I think you'll really enjoy the newest Season (and Season 10) despite the special guest element anyhow.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You haven't tuned in since Season 9? If you haven't just want to let you know, that despite the special guests that show has only gotten better, Aisha too. We've gotten a handful pretty good guests, a handful of guestless episodes too. I recommend you and those who haven't tuned into the show since, to start tuning now; You've missed out on quite a bit, and not only that but it'd definitely pump up the ratings, which will help contribute to the network giving the show another season.

The Network giving it another season could quite possibly lead to a decision to drop the guest element part of the show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even though you aren't much of a fan of the guests; You should really tune back in. It's gotten much better than Season 9 (Let's face it, even I would turn my back on that Season 9 and say it didn't happen!); Season 10 and the Current one we've gotten episodes of such amazing quality its been unreal. Handful of guestless eps too (9 as of August 10th); There are also a handful of guests that have knocked it out of the park too. I say tune in once again; The more ratings the more chance of another season, and with more seasons, the more chance of dropping the special guest element. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still think its quite good, even moreso with the newest season, all of them are pretty relaxed now. Banter is being added in more as well. What you're probably noticing is that the editors aren't making the right choices, you see they do 18-25 games every taping (All different, usually 4 are for guests; and a lot are older classic games!) and the editor hasn't been creative as much. 

Other than that its still great! Aisha is finally relaxed in the chair (Btw, all of the cast knew Aisha before she landed the host role); A lot more banter has been edited in, and newer/older games are starting to just surface. 

As for guests, yeah.. Hit or miss; But we do get the joy of some guestless episodes this season. Also some good ones will stop by this season (Namely: "Penn   Teller", Kathie Lee Gifford, Alfonso Ribeiro, Bill Nye The Science Guy, Yvette Nicole Brown (Who is on Community, and played Helen on "Drake   Josh".  </TEXT>
