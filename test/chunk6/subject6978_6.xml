	<TEXT> My number one goal: making it to the gym at least 5 times a week without excuses. I went through some horrible DOMS this week and really couldn't work out since Friday!
My second goal is building a booty. Since I lost over 60 pounds my butt has completely disappeared. I've started to see progress through my workout, so I'm motivated!
Third goal is to be able to do a pull up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm interested! Thank you! Today I was actually fired for very unfair and stupid reasons from my waitressing job, and I'm moving to another town in a few weeks, which means I'll be bored and home a lot! Worried about eating too much out of boredom... But no excuses for getting to the gym! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, ignore what the people around you say. Eat whatever fits your regime and to hell with what they say or think. This is easier said than done, but as time goes by the people around you will know to respect your wishes.. To give you and example, on passover dinner everyone ate 4 mazo balls. I ate one. I got so many dirty looks, I could hear their thoughts thinking I'm crazy. But who wins in the end? YOU. You win control, you win self confidence, you win trust in yourself. Yes, just by resisting temptation. It makes you THAT much stronger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I hope its OK to post here like this. I'm 22 years old and went through a long weight loss process from 80 kg (176lbs) to right now 52 kg (114 lbs). I started going to the gym around 6 months ago, started with elliptical and Zumba and a bit of weights, typical beginner girl workout. Around a month ago a trainer built a new program for me, lifting more weight and getting a bit more serious into lifting. In the 6 months in the gym I went from 59 kg (130 lbs) and 32% body fat to 52 kg (114 lbs) and 22% body fat.

The program is as follows:

15x3 barbell squat 25kg (55 lbs)

2x8 deadlift 30kg (66 lbs)

10x3 Butterfly press  with 4kg dumbbell (8 lbs)

12x3 bench press with 5kg dumbbell (11 lbs)

12x3 shoulder press with 4kg dumbbell (8 lbs)

12x3 assisted pull ups 36 kg (80 lbs)

20 sit ups followed by 1 minute plank x3

I do this routine 3 times a week followed by 20-30 minutes of cardio (elliptical or running)

My issue is that I naturally have chunkier legs than core and my butt went a bit flat after losing weight. Now with the squats I feel like my butt did get a bit perkier, but my thighs are increasing way too much in size, and its not what I'm looking for personally. I know many women like gains in the legs, but as a former fattie I'm looking for leaner legs. Also being very short at 159 cm (5" 2) when my legs are bigger I just look shorter. Yes, I'm squatting low and slow and engaging my glutes just in case you were wondering.

So what can I do to stop gaining mass on my quads? What can I change, add or take out from my program to have leaner legs and a nicer butt?

Are programs like strong curves good for somebody like me? I really want to get serious about weight lifting, but I want to stay lean since its very important for me. Any tips and suggestions are welcome! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Snacking help </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, so lately I've been having trouble with snacking on small things during the day. For example, just a few cranberries, half a cookie, a few strawberries, a piece of chocolate... You get my point. This wasn't an issue before, but after hitting my goal weight I guess I'm being less strict with myself.

Do you have any tips that could help me stop munching on unnecessary things? Whether it's an action, a thought or an idea, I'd love to hear.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't counted calories for one day in my life, went from 80kg to 52. No, you don't need to count calories.
I'm the kind of person that WILL get obsessed with doing that kind of thing, and that's why I decided not to do it.
Good luck </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend and I eat out multiple times a week and I still managed to lose weight very well. I usually take a salad or soup (unless its a high-carb soup like lentils or potatoes). If I feel like indulging a bit more I take an entre. Or a normal dish like chicken breast and I don't eat the side dish, or only a small part of it.
Some tips- drink lots of water before eating and during, you'll be more full and less tempted.
No dressing on the salad.
Nothing full of butter.
You can try other peoples dishes just one bite. </TEXT>
