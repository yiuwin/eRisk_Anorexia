	<TEXT> Because egalitarians don't do things like protest the building of men's shelters, defend domestic abusers if they are a woman, support the myth that rape is a tool of patriarchy and only ever done by men to women, don't verbally attack women for things like shaving or wanting to be a stay at home mom...they aren't hypocrites. They don't have their own mold their trying to force women into and roles they're trying to portray all men as- they just want everyone to have equal rights, opportunities, and treatment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was forced into professional "help" almost a year and a half ago and all it did was make things worse. I was told I was wasting space because my problems were my own doing, that my cuts were "superficial" anyway, and when I was moved into a different facility the psychiatrist who came to see me did something that basically ruined me and that happens to be the reason I want to cut right now. There is no way in hell I could ever willingly get anywhere near any sort of professional again. Even talking to anyone in that profession makes me afraid and panicked and even more upset. It's very very frustrating. 

I do appreciate the links though, thank you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me there are three reasons- I'm a masochist. It's like how some people like to be tickled, so it makes them feel better when they're sad. But I like the little tearing feeling of tiny, shallow, short cuts opening.

-It's at least *something* to feel. Being completely emotionally numb and dissociated is devastating. I feel dead sometimes, and then the pain and small amount of blood comfort me, making me feel alive, like a living being instead of a floating corpse.

-It's constant. Everyone leaves me or betrays me or hurts me it seems, but I'll always be able to find a sharp object. And the pain is constant when I'm not fighting through recovery- my jeans will rub the day-old wounds, I'll shift wrong and it will throb, the water in the shower will sting. The little bit of pain is always there and it keeps me grounded.  </TEXT>
