	<TEXT> Thanks! I'm not made of money, but we could afford up to $3200 a month in rent for the right location (not looking to buy until we've been there a while ). We have been all over the Big Island and we like Kailua-Kona the best. We would like to be near some good schools, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aiming to move in December/January. I'm a IT consultant so I would be flying to California (where we live now) every other month for a week in person. What's amazing is I'm able to keep my California salary, just as long as I stay productive and work 6 AM-2 PM. We have narrowed it down to Oahu or the Big Island. We have 2 girls (1 and 4), and a small dog. Might be long term, if we like it. Any advice? Questions? Anyone else done this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same here, but I breezed through college, mostly because I chose a business degree. I didn't really understand what engineering was and now I realize I should have chosen an engineering major. I'm doing a ton of self-study to attempt to get an engineering job (software) and it's tough to make time for that with a full time job and 2 kids! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've got the Seaview 180, and I really like it. I usually have issues getting a good seal with traditional masks, but this one was a dream, no water building up under my nose. Diving to 5-8 feet is possible, but it's much more difficult because of all the air inside. Another caveat is that the view is slightly distorted due to the round viewing area, so that can throw off your ability to gauge distances. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will sound weird, but Crocs make a flip-flop (sorry I'm a Californian) which does not break, does not smell, and does not stain feet. They also stay comfortable for the whole day and have really good grip for rocky terrain. I got mine in Kailua-Kona in 2013 and I have used them regularly ever since then without any visible wear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly this is so incredibly rare... how many times have you as a driver had to made this decision? The only times I have heard of a car killing a group of people is when someone hits the gas instead of brake (they were never trying to save their own life), which is never going to happen with a self-driving car. The car should also be able to detect when approaching a populated area and drive much slower. </TEXT>
