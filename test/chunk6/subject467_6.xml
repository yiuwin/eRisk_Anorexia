	<TEXT> In my second year of university I realised I had signed up for a potentially useless arts degree. (turned out I was correct.) I had a lot of spare time though so I taught myself animation and graphic design. I now make motion graphics full time for TV. I'm literally paid to do what I did at home for free. 

Tldr. University time hobby now myand super fun full time job.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An issue is that a lot of the money these people earn doesn't go back into our economy: it's sent overseas to help their family. A noble cause yes but when you see 12 foreign labourers living in a couple of caravans not paying any tax it's feels a bit like cheating the system.  </TEXT>

Me and my girlfriend like to save up and do a nice meal about this price every year or so if we can afford it but the meal will usually last a whole evening. Dropping 300 on a 40 minute meal at a metro station is a bit steep even if I am dying to try his sushi.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having played tonnes of 1v1s I have played much more 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 the past year or so.

They are all completely different.

1v1 - You are responsible for your own actions completely, if you fuck up then you have to fix it. On the flipside you are in complete control and can carry out a coordinated attack without worrying about your team-mate bailing on you or mis-timing things.

2v2 - Teamwork is everything. I only play with people on skype so we get things pretty tight. The key here is to pick two completely different doctrines to fill in each others weak spots and work as one. Its tempting to storm up each side of the map separately but i've noticed the better players roam around separately and then when making contact bring all the troops together on the conflicted point from different angles.

3v3 - Playing this most of all recently. Its a very free-form game and it generally ends up splitting like a 1v1 and a 2v2 all in the same game. The trick is to stay loose and not try to dig in as a single player. If three teams converge on a load of emplacements there is going to be a lot of wasted manpower.

4v4 - Again, played a fair bit of this as a skype team and it divulges into two 2v2 games a lot of the time. generally the maps are quite big so this woks pretty well as a basis. There is often tonnes of room for flanking though so use this to your advantage/dont get caught out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 'side by side' made by Keanu the Reeves, a documentary about cinema's paradigm shift from celluloid film to digital recording and work flow. 

If you like films watch this. It has interviews with every top director from George lucas to Danny Boyle. It explains things in a really simple way but has enough technicalities and trivia to keep even die hard movie enthusiasts like me engaged from start to finish!  </TEXT>

Did you visit the Tuamotos at all south of marquesas? After the big green mountains those little thin desert islands were a big change of scenery!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was such a crazy place. We got there after 33 days at sea with nothing to see but a few flying fish and a lot of waves. Then waking up to see these huge mountains stabbing out of the water was incredible. I remember the smell of land too as we were getting close!

The food was definitely amazing, would you ever go back? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly take the roll out of the cardboard box. 

For saran wrap just wrap whatever you're wrapping and cut the plastic with a sharp knife, hell even your fingernail against the counter top will score it enough. Failing that just stab it in a line roughly in a line where you want it to tear then pull and it will come off fairly evenly.

For foil just rip it, its pretty difficult to fuck that up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have restraints and rope but after tying down (face forward, face up), hog tying, frog tying I'm starting to lose my creativity a bit. 

Are there any good online resources to get some more ideas and to learn a bit better technique? 

My knots aren't too bad but they definitely aren't the easiest to get out of in a pinch! so it would be brilliant to learn some more elegant techniques. Not to mention I'd love to get her to learn a bit better; she sucks at tying me up so anything from beginner to advanced is welcome! </TEXT>

No questions really apart from what did you think of french polinisia? (Marquesas islands especially). I spent a good while on Nuku Hiva and got a really cool tattoo from the cousin of the guy that owns the yacht supply shop! </TEXT>

I sailed from the galapagos to the marquesas islands for 35 days. That's roughly 33 days with no land even in sight. When you spend that long in confinement with the same people you start to notice minute details about them that drive you insane.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've checked out all the links in the sidebar but my book budget only does so far so i could do with a little advice!

I have been making motion graphics for TV for about a year now but before this i studied music and sound design. Everything I know, graphic design wise, is self taught and therefore i feel like my knowledge of the basics will always be incomplete!

Without the time or funds to take a year or two and do a course, which books or resources would you recommend above all that will give a good coverage of fundamental concepts?

	<TEXT> But do you really want to give up your actual personal memory of every beautiful moment?

Think of every time you have re-watched a film you loved as a child but is now cheesy, predictable and dull. Your memory stored and colored that experience based on everything that made you who you were at the time. You are a different person experiencing the film now.

Now imagine your first kiss, first time driving a car, last time you went to a fancy restaurant or a crazy party. Your imagination has colored some of these experiences and photos could never do them justice, Facebook has documented others extremely well so you can always go back and look at that evening exactly as it was forever more. 

But with more and more information recorded, will we remember what it was like right there and then? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And see your wife doing something odd that catches your attention.

And keep thinking about it for the rest of your day.

And keep going back to it and other abstract memories to see try and find some kind of meaning.

And drag up old relationships your wife has had then argue and go to bed in silence.

And eventually find the last piece of the puzzle that fits into place and confirms your slumbering suspicions.

And then you kill your wife. </TEXT>
