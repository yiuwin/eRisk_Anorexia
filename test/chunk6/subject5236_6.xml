	<TEXT> The summer after 8th grade I went on a school trip to DC, we visited all the historic ittes nearby and I pick up a sick little cannon in Bull Run. Well when we were leaving back to Denver, my luggage got stopped because of the little cannon. The guy inspects and I was nervous he was gonna confiscate it. He didn't thank god but then he goes on to describe HOW I CAN MAKE IT INTO A WORKING CANNON! Just what 13 year me needed was a working mini cannon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In seventh grade I was friends with a few girls and had been friends since fifth. We all went to the school dance together and got a picture taken at the photographer set up they had. The girl I was closest with kept the photo in her binder but soon she started becoming a giant bitch to me, and one day she scribbled me out of the photo and showed me. It honestly broke my heart and I started to sob on the bus after she showed me. It's senior year of high school now and she's pretty much alienated everybody who she was friends with. </TEXT>
