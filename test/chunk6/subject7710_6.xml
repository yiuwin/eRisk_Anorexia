	<TEXT> There are good and horrible ways to help the poor. Promoting entrepreneurship, for example, is a great way. 

 Our current strategies keep the poor poor.

If it takes months, piles of paperwork and thousands in compliance costs to start up a food stand or landscaping business, you will ensure the poor stay poor. 

Giving someone free money indefinitely for not working is also a great way to ensure the poor stay poor. 

It's not surprising that the groups who receive the most benefits are the worst off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Posts should cause viewers to facepalm. The following is not allowed:

memes/macros

obvious jokes/sarcasm

grammar/spelling errors

posts based on age

posts about likes/shares/reposts, etc.

direct links to Reddit or other social media content

Bigotry is not tolerated, though facepalming at it is welcome. Do not ask for personal info, harass or stalk others, troll, or engage trolls. Do not engage in witch hunts.

Your rules only ban posts about reposts, I didn't know reposts weren't allowed since I've seen several reposts on this sub.  </TEXT>
