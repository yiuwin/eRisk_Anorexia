	<TEXT> Wikipedia is basically YouTube for me, except with text instead of videos. I go on to the site to look at one thing, and six hours later I am so deeply lost in who-even-knows-what and asking myself *how did I end up here?*

Active links and "suggested for you" sidebars are torture for my attention span lol. I wish I retained half of what I learn in my exploits, though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I second this! Keto has been amazing for me. Make sure you're getting plenty of protein. Some of my go to energy boost foods for hectic days are things like hardboiled eggs, light cheese sticks, salted almonds, turkey jerky, or Greek yogurt. I rarely have time on work days to actually eat a meal up until dinner, if then even, so keeping these foods handy is a godsend for me as far as making sure I have the energy to make it through the day.

Also be mindful of your electrolytes. When mine start to get out of balance, it makes me lethargic and mentally unfocused. Pickles and pickle juice are amazing for helping this. (It also helps with muscle cramps, so I'm a weirdo and drink a shot or two of pickle juice every night before bed.) Good stuff! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This one was experimental, as I was out of heavy whipping cream and I wanted to play with flavors, but it worked out fine and may have even been a touch fluffier than it usually is.

I used [this recipe](http://www.tasteaholics.com/recipes/low-carb-keto/keto-lava-cake/) but instead of whipping cream, I used 1 tablespoon of melted light butter. I also used 1 tbsp of cocoa and 1 tbsp of PB2 instead of just 2 tbsp of cocoa and, I have to say, it was pretty great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Vodka and Rockstar Zero. No carbs and pretty low in calories....unless I go on a bender and drink the whole bottle lol. One good thing about eating low carb and restricting is that I can get pretty buzzed off of one or two drinks these days. 

If I feel like beer instead, I'll just go cheap and simple and have a Miller Lite. They have 96 calories and 3.2g carbs each, so not terrible unless I drink a lot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I carry around a container of himalayan pink salt chunks to suck on throughout the day, if that tells you anything lol. My electrolytes get wacky real easily so my salt intake needs to be pretty high. I also carry a container of fine ground pink salt in my bag, for putting on food or adding to my water. I love salt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get super snappy when I hyper-restrict too long. I want nothing more than to be left alone 24/7 so I can screw around with numbers and counts on MFP and obsess in peace. I'll plan weeks of meals out, make grocery shopping lists, and just obsess and Lord help anyone who interrupts me. 

The less I eat, the less I sleep too so I am pretty much always just a raging bitch these days. I've almost successfully pushed everyone in my life away at this point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have lost a ton of weight but I certainly don't feel small or skinny. I have a stat twin here (username is escaping me, ugh memory probs) who posts in the selfie threads sometimes, and when I see her I am like "no way am I that thin" even though our stats are the same. 

Hell, I can hold up a pair of my jeans and say "these are tiny, I can't wear these!" and then wear them and still convince myself that they magically quadrupled in size to accommodate my huge body. 

Body dysmorphia is a big ole bag of assholes. I would just like to know what I *really* look like, and actually have my brain not distort it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was bad hooked on coke for a while and yeah, I lost a lot of weight but it was mostly because every dollar I had went up my nose and I had nothing for food. Then my sinuses got fucked up and I couldnt snort it anymore so I started smoking it because "What's the diff?" Oh yeah, *that's crack.* Every waking moment not high was spent figuring out how to get high, not food. Rough span of time, that was. 10/10 wouod not recommend. :/

	<TEXT> One of my favorite meals right now is a center cut pork chop, riced cauliflower, and baby spinach. I pan sear the chop on both sides then bake it in the oven with Walden Farms BBQ sauce. I use lemon pepper  for seasoning the cauliflower and Walden Farms dressing on the baby spinach. Depending on the weight of the chop, this meal is easily between 200-250 calories and it's low carb and high in protein so it's great for my macros (and filling!) 

This is my go to dinner right now, followed up with a Light n Fit Yogurt as dessert (Moar protein, yay!) and this keeps me full until around lunchtime the next day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Starving myself, depriving myself of sleep, drinking excessively, doing really careless and stupid things with no regard for my safety or wellbeing, etc. I'm actually a lot better about most of all that right now. The ED has consumed most of my energy so things I used to do (cut/burn myself) to cope with my dysfunctional brain no longer tempt me unless I am having an exceptionally hard time with something. 

Out of all the self-harming things I've done over the years, not eating has been the most satisfying and rewarding. I know that sounds bizarre, but I don't know how to explain it. I used to cut myself as a self punishment but it was a fleeting relief whereas the perpetual hunger is more prolonged. Over time it has become my security blanket, I guess. I suck at explaining things lol so I hope that made a small bit of sense at least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Raises hand*.

I am diagnosed BPD among other things. Started treatment last year, started DBT, started medications, got bored with it all and dove further into my ED after a short while of "trying to get better." 

I don't really have problems with my emotions or attachments currently, as I have basically just stopped feeling anything at all most of the time. I have isolated myself and it probably sounds lame and sad but I guess this is "okay" as I have felt in a while. I mean, I still have horrible self destructive behaviors, and self loathing but eh, I guess that is just who I am. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lost between 90-100 lbs between April and November of last year. Since reaching my GW of 90lbs, I toyed with maintaining over the holiday months, but started back to my keto/restriction yesterday because I miss it and feel gross even though I didn't gain. 

What worked for me was keto, restriction and exercise. And also depression and major anxiety lol. I don't really recommend those last two haha, but keto is amazing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My 2017 goals: 

* I'm back on keto, which means no more alcohol because I have a problem with doing things in moderation so it's all or nothing for me. 

* Journal. Every day. Actually two journals - one for diet/exercise and one for feelings, thoughts, ideas, etc. I am an internalizer because I trust no one enough to confide in. But bottling things up also tends to cause me trouble so this will hopefully help me make sense of myself. 

* Do things to make myself feel better about myself. Go to a spa, get a manicure/pedicure, wear makeup, wear perfume, splurge on expensive hair stuff. 

* Stop being a goddamn hermit. Get out. Be a person. Do things with my dogs. Go to some concerts. See a movie in the theater. Join a gym or a running club. Just stop hiding. 

* More tattoos. 

* Save some fucking money. 

* Stop being a doormat. 

* Run a 5k. 

* Stop smoking.

Ugh, I've got my work cut out for me.

	<TEXT> I LOVE numbers! I'm old fashioned, and do a lot of my planning/figuring/tracking on paper. I also like to up the crazy-meter a bit by color coding my scribbles. Lord help me if anyone ever comes across my notebooks lol. 

There is just something comforting about the process of it all. It calms my mind. Seeing things planned out, measured, accounted for. It helps my ED brain and my OCD when things are tidy and planned. I'm also less likely to screw up and binge if I have to write all those numbers down. In red, angry ink lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keto, for me, gave me great energy after the initial "keto flu" but unfortunately no matter what you are eating, long-term restriction seems to just deplete the body. I know I had to increase my intake because I was sooooo damn tired all the time that I could barely make it through work, let alone exercise. Getting adequate protein helps, and *for me* keeping my carb intake super low helps me as well. Sugars and carbs give me an energy boost, sure, but it's gone in no time and then I'm even more exhausted. 

I try to keep my focus on lean meats, eggs and iron rich vegetables. Low iron also makes me drag ass.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have found my savior. I have noticed that my cravings for sweets have gone crazy lately, and when I binge I tend to do it on sweet stuff....which is horrible because I eat keto and have for a long time so my body does not process carbs well at all anymore. Slip ups are horrible both mentally and physically. 

I'm always searching for low-cal/low-carb ways to satisfy my sweet tooth and besides Quest bars, nothing really does it for me when my brain gets fixated on wanting something sweet. Except this week I discovered a generously sized 100 calorie bottle of chocolate Muscle Milk which is surprisingly amazing. And it has 20ish grams of protein and only 2g net carbs. 

They are sort of expensive but less so than binge food and without the horrible guilt. And with all the protein, they are super filling! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quest bars do this to me like nothing else, seriously. I don't know what it is about them (maybe the sucrolose?) but they make me want to eat more immediately after finishing one. It goes away after a bit but if I am in a weak state of mind, it's dangerous. 

My solution to this is to only eat them in the morning at work and not take anything else with me, that way I'm not tempted to eat more. If I eat one in the evening when I'm at home, I would probably binge eat my entire house. Or I could just not eat them at all, but they do give me energy and have plenty of protein so they help me make it through the workday.
