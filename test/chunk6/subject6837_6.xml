	<TITLE> Me [18F] with my brothers [22 and 16 M/] think its a huge problem I am missing Christmas this year. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok so about 10 days agao I brought my plane ticket to Europe I will be in Europe from December 18 to January 9th. This was more of an impulse buy but this is something that I have wanted to do for awhile and I finally can do it. Me and my brothers are pretty close. Also I haven't told my mom yet I am just watting for the right time to do it. My brother has also been away for Easter  he said that this is different( he was studying in Ireland). Also my sister has missed Easter and my brother said he was really pissed about that but this is more serious then missing Easter like my sister did. 

Well I told my brothers a few days after I bought it as they weren't home at the time that I bought my tickets and they are so mad that I will be missing Christmas this year. They are saying how this is a huge deal and it is a family matter. That I should change all my flights witch will cost me a a lot of money to do so it is not even in the question. I was like I will Skype on Christmas and talk to the family for a bit. I have my flight from London to rome on Christmas day so I will have wifi and I will just arrive at the airport early and they were like no if your not going to be home don't even bother fuckin talking to us. they are also saying how your going to make mom feel that you don't want to be around her witch is totally not true even tho my mom does feel that none of us want to be around her. They are making me feel bad about missing one Christmas and I am just to my breaking point I don't know what to do.I have never missed a holiday I been home for everyone.

Are they right here should I be home for Christmas and just lose all the money that I spent.Or am I right here should I go and have fun? 
  Sorry if its a lot of rambling and its out of order or that. 
  **tl;dr: Not going to be home this year for Christmas this year and my brother are making a huge deal out of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started hrt the second week of my senior year of high school. I came out like 3 weeks later so everybody knew that I was transgender and transatioing nobody really said anything they just really didn't care at all and left me alone some times people would laugh at me tho. It helps if you have a supportive sibling because people would say stuff behind my back and he was there to tell them off. I wish I could help more but sadly I didn't socially transition in high school.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Srs in thiland parents don't want me to go </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-23 11:04:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Alright so around 6 months agao I started looking into srs  around the time I turned 18. Well at first I started looking at Marci bowers but they don't accept my insurance and long waiting list. So I heard about chewutte and spourn ( or how ever you spell them) and I started looking into chewutte as I have heard about him before turning 18 and really like his work and that so I emailed them. I got the price for surgery. I found a spread sheet of all the prices for hotels online and roughly the total price. So I had a surgery date picked out had all the fourms I need to sign and just had to put the deposits down. So after I had everything I told my mom as she would have to go and I wanted to her to go well at first she was fine with me getting it and said she would go and figure all of it out with money and that. So I was pretty happy then she messages me one day saying why don't I use insurance so I said ok I will look and try to find one in the us and that took my insurance. She helped a bit told me about mginn that really close to me well I haven't found any none that accept my insurance. so as thiland is cheeper I want Thailand to chewutte as he was my first choice. But during the time I was looking for a us surgeon my mom and older brother expressed concerns that they didn't want me to get it done in thiland. They said that it was worse then the us and that people that can't get it done(don't have the requirements) get it done there, that it's not safe and they 100% really didn't want me to go. Well as I said I can't find a us surgeons and can't afford $25k like I am going to collage and can't afford that even with a loan. So well I want to go to thiland it's cheeper and I really wanted to go to chewutte first and its still where I want to go. But with that I going to need to take out a medical loan and most likely going to need my parents help. So how do I convince my parents that thiland isn't as bad and horrible as they think it is? Does anybody have any resources that will help with this? How do I go about asking my parents to help me take out a loan for this? (Sorry for wording and that on my phone)  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My health insurance says the cover something but won't give me any surgeons </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-23 05:48:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Alright so I am transgender and I have gotten to a place in my transition where I have began thinking about gender reassignment surgery. I have been searching for about 6 months to find one that takes my insurence I have emailed some really well know surgeons and even less know ones. Now I know my insurance does cover srs I need pre authorize tho. But now here comes that problem as I haven't been able to find any surgeons that is willing to take my insurance I called them to see if they could point me in the right direction to a surgeon that takes my insurance well they couldn't find any surgeons at all and were extremely unhelpful and didn't even know what I was talking about at all it took about 20min till the lady on the phone finally realized what I was talking about it well should couldn't find anything either and just told me to use the thing in there website to look for one that does it well I have not managed to find any none. From what it seems and read online since I have Medicaid most surgeons refuse to take my insurance or surgeons just don't take insurance. Is there anything that I can do  about this or am I just sol and going to end up paying out of pocket because my insurance isn't contracted with any surgeons?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You will have to do some internet searching to see if there is one where you live. Informed consent is where you acknowledge the risk and you don't need a therapist letter and then you sign a forum and they will take blood work and prescribe you the meds. But it is not instant it could take awhile to get an apt I know mine took like one month to get my apt maybe a bit longer. </TEXT>
