	<TEXT> Well I didn't upgrade it at all, but I also had no fairy fountains near buy. I just made enough and bought one of the sets from kakariko. I'd wait to hear some other input just incase it is worth it to upgrade it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boarded three horses (Royal stallion and giant horse being 2/3) and the only times I ever actually rode them was to get them boarded.

Although, I did use one once to light the fire of the akkala ancient tech lab. Worked great, until I ran past that guardian and got blown up. Horse died, I didn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The armor from the very beginning? I sold that as soon as I got something better. Thought it was going to take up inventory space. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wasn't that easy for me. I briefly looked at a guide on how to get through, didn't follow it just looked at a general tip to make my way through it. 

SPOILER BELOW

Follow the wind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found it challenging at first, not so much anymore though. But I am also 200+ hours into the game with all 120 shrines. 
It is a fantastic game though and even if it doesn't meet your difficulty needs this subreddit has came up with quite a few interesting/harder ways to try and play the game. 

Summer DLC:
Hard mode
Cave of Trials challenge
New map feature

Winter DLC:
New original story
New dungeon
Additional challenges

	<TEXT> Can't remember the spot but if you YouTube it, there is a video where a guy goes to an area with 3 horseback riders and if you stand still and have the camera (Not rune) pointed down on yourself, you'll never get hit and can just pick up as many arrows as you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's all I did for like the first 80 to 100 hours, after the starting area, is mindlessly explore. There was a stable so close to the great plateau and I didn't even get it until 100 shrines in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shouldn't be, but they are and in Imo I like it. I don't fight ganon enough for me to care how easy he was but I love the "challenge" of Lynels. (not much of a challenge any more)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Explore and talk to everyone and you'll get a lot of side quests to do. I just finished all shrines last night so tonight I'm going to turn off my HUD and just go exploring and farming dragon parts to upgrade some of my gear.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 25 and never really thought about my favorite games but I never really got into many games as much as I have with botw. So I'm going to say it's definitely number 1.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Why would you run away to find a boat instead of using the ice block rune to get it across the water? 

2. Lynels with clubs are definitely harder than the boss but I don't find that to be an issue. Only had to fight the boss once, I fight Lynels daily. Boss doesn't drop loot, Lynels do. 

3. Dlc with hard mode should take care of that. And as for the shrines that just have a chest, I've never had any issue with having to go through a loading screen for that. The chests in those ones are usually worth it. I actually like them cause they are blessing for going through a trial outside the shrine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did the same thing about a week ago. Blew my mind until I realized I had ancient arrows equipped. Thought I some how sent him to another dimension or something since he didn't drop anything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Travel from Lake tower to Faron tower by climbing to tallest things you can find. For some reason I slightly remember an area such as this and I really think it's somewhere in that general area. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Wouldn't it be nice if you could have a stat screen that showed how many:
Times you've died and hearts lost
Times you've used divine beast skills
Arrows you've fired
Times each rune has been used
Weapons and shields you've gone through
Good meals you've cooked and dubious food


How far you've walked or climbed. 


Can't really think of what else there could be, but I thought it would be pretty cool to have something like this. I'd love to know all these answers.

	<TEXT> It's definitely going to be the first one I get when I start a new game. I don't even know how many times I've used it or how much time it has saved me. With max stamina and climbing gear upgraded twice.. Man, climbing is easy. Get some enduring elixirs/food and you can climb for days. 

Really into climbing to explore. Never walked the paths much and after 150h in game, I still ran into like 4 stables that I didn't have.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do whatever you want to. If you enjoy it more the way you are doing it, do that. Personally, I'm doing the same thing. Although I found 101 shrines before looking to a guide for the rest. And I've only had to look at shrine solutions for about 6 or 7 of those. </TEXT>
