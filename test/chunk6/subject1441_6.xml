	<TEXT> :/. I've had moments like that too. First thing you need to do is breathe. Relax. You are okay. Feel your feet on the floor and know that you are safe. 

Now, to think rationally about it, if you are eating to maintain your weight, could you take one piece of bread and half it with the same amount of meat?  That way it's the same calories and protein. When/ if you get your normal bread back, you can make your meals like you always had.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Life without Ed by Jenny Schaffer helped me immensely. She's been through anorexia and safely in recovery and works as an eating disorder outreach person. 

I also really enjoyed the diary of an exercise addict. She survived anorexia with an exercise compulsion. Parts of the book are her actual diary at the time, but most of it is her story looking back from now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mediterranean Cafe. Lunch only. Cash only. Hummus to die for among other things. It's on the part of state street near campus and not to be confused with Mediterranean grill(though I've heard that's good too. )

Pita pit has some good healthy options. 

If you wander over toward the Atwood neighborhood at all, the Green Owl is phenomenal but all vegetarian/ vegan so if you're looking for meat, this isn't a good option. 

The Nepali place (himul chuli or something that I can't spell) has some good and healthy/ light options. As does rising sons. Both places are on state with rising sons being near campus and the Nepali place being near the Capitol. Rising sons is one of my favorites on state.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you looked at a growth chart to see where your weight was tracking to end up pre AN?  You're young and most people continue to gain weight naturally into their early 20's as their body settled into it's adult form. I'm guessing the doc said you're good now because you're medically stable. Also, marked increases in cognitive functioning occurs as AN patients hit bmi 19. With that being said, I second the other person's suggestion to find a quality therapist. And that weight gain goes to the middle first to protect the vital organs. 

Kudos to you for restoring weight. Doing so is incredibly brave because gaining is scary. I also admire your insight into the fact that you probably need to add more weight despite what the doctor said. I urge you to get more medical opinions and to maintain this mindset of figuring out what is healthiest  for your body. Good luck with recovery! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I took it in the fall of 2014 which was the first 104 course with the new curriculum. They focus on concepts and such which makes it easier. And the professor prepared the class well for all the tests. That in addition to showing up for labs and discussion being worth so many points, made it possible for the distribution to occur. The tests being multiple choice helped too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2 tsp Active dry yeast
3.5 cups bread flour
1.5 tbsp granulated sugar
1.5 tsp salt
1.25 cups water

-Mix 1/2 cup of the water (it should be quite warm) with the yeast and sugar.  Let it stand for 5-10 mins and get foamy.
-Add the flour, salt, and most of the remaining warm water. 
-Kneed until the dough is smooth and doesn't stick to the bowl (took me about 10 mins).  You may need to add the rest of the water to get the right consistency.
-Cover the bowl with a damp towel and allow to rise for an hour.
-Punch dough down and let it sit for 10 mins
-Set oven to 425 and boil a pot of water
-Shape the dough into 8 bagels
-Boil bagels for 1-2 minutes on each side .  I was closer to 2 minutes because I prefer a chewier bagel with a chewier texture.
-Bake bagels for 20-25 mins on greased pan.  They should be lightly golden brown and a toothpick should come out clean. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Songs that speak to you about recovery </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-07 04:26:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since I'm still relatively new to recovery, I seem to see ED triumph analogies in so many songs. Thought I'd list a few and why they matter to me and see if anyone else had any. 

Fight Song by Rachel Platten: this is the first song I heard after my parents found out I had anorexia and I asked them for help. The lyrics motivate me like no other and remind me that even when I'm down, I can keep going. I've lost friends through this process but even though they don't believe in me, I have so much left. 

Out of the Woods by Taylor Swift: as I push toward weight restoration, I wonder if I'm out of the woods and into the clear in terms of medical safety as well as mental stability. The clear, to me, is a place where I don't feel the need to restrict and my exercise urges drop. I want to be out of the woods where I've been trapped so long. 

Stand by You by Rachel Platten: can you tell I love her?  This song reminds me of the great people in my life. My mom especially has been there standing by me and walking through hell. My sister and a few of my old friends as well. 

Unwell by Matchbox 20: I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell. I find this to be so true. And it helps me to remember that the Ed sucks but it's going to be temporary. I'll get back to how I used to be. Not the exact same because this has been so life changing but back to being well.  </TEXT>
