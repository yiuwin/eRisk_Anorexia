	<TEXT> My hero is me.

I know that sounds egotistical of me, but I'm a firm believer that I am responsible for my own actions. I'm known as a funny and friendly guy; and for me to stay that way, when there has been a lot of negativity in my life, is pretty damn awesome. "Love life and don't be a dick" is my motto (unfortunately I was pretty much named John Thomas so not being a dick was tough to do) and I stick by it. I talk my friend's down from shitty situations, I'm always there with a shoulder to cry on, and I always help others when I can. 

I'm my hero.

I also love BBQ. Favorite = ribs from Rendezvous  </TEXT>

I know about baggies being intent to distribute. I usually dont deal with people who are worried or paranoid about that b/c they probably have reason to. My dealers are small potatoes. The only reason they don't have baggies is b/c they smoked too much pot and forgot to get more.
