	<TEXT> **tl;dr:** I recommend you watch the past 3 seasons but if you don't have time, read about past 3 seasons and you can start from season 4. Ghost Rider begins this season so anything Ghost Rider related will be from season 4.


There are definitely elements of the past seasons and the fallout still affects the team in the current season.

If you have time, I would definitely watch the past seasons if you want the full MCU pleasure because all the movies and all the shows are connected. 

If you don't have time to watch the past 3 seasons and want to start in season 4, I recommend reading the past 3 seasons, the plots, the characters, perhaps watching a summary of them from youtube videos.

Season 4 starts fresh with a new storyline so you should be able to start in season 4 if you know the background of past 3 seasons, some parts you may be confused.

	<TEXT> I've been waiting for the opportunity to tell this story.


The year was 1996. I was a junior in high school, and me and a group of friends decided that we were going to **steal the Olympic Torch.**


It took a fair amount of planning... we knew the exact date and time that the torch relay would be coming through our town, and the idea was that as the relay proceeded down the main thoroughfare and over a small bridge, two of us were supposed to feign a knock-down-drag-out fight in the street to cause the procession to stop, one of us was supposed to dart out of the crowd to snatch the torch from the bearer and drop it over the side of the bridge into the bed of a truck that the forth person would then speed away in and escape using a carefully prearranged route. I was on fight spectacle duty. Me and my cohort had practiced for days on how our over-the-top theatrical brawl could most effectively cause commotion/distraction and interrupt the torch relay long enough for our buddy to waltz in there and grab it.


Juvenile? Yes. Irresponsible, dangerous, unpatriotic? Yeah, but we were just kids. It doesn't really matter though, because our carefully laid, convoluted plans were ultimately foiled by pretty much the most unlikely thing one can imagine:


As we stood ready, the torch bearer and attendant joggers within sight a mere 50 yards away and closing, a man on a unicycle, juggling tennis balls, veered on to the road. Not terribly strange, as it was a bit of a carnival atmosphere to begin with... but moments later an ice cream truck went speeding across the intersection and just hit the unicyclist going at least 30 mph. I can still see the yellow-green tennis balls bouncing away from the scene of this surreal and horrific accident, to the tune of the ice cream truck's eerily inappropriate music. Turns out the truck was stolen by a teenage illegal immigrant being chased by INS (it was in the news, you can actually look it up).


Needless to say, this event was enough to spook me and my friends, and we bugged out. Looking back, something like that really makes you wonder if the universe isn't somehow looking out for you. I mean... an illegal immigrant in an ice cream truck ran over a man on a unicycle juggling tennis balls, preventing me from making a very bad life choice. At any rate I'm willing to bet nothing like that has ever happened to anyone else. </TEXT>
