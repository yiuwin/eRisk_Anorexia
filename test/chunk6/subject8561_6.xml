It's just not my criteria for president.  

Politics is a meat grinder and Hillary can grind some meat.  Bernie has great ideas but won't beat the devil at the devil's game 

 Cons: Not likeable, not honest

Pros: smart, skilled political operator, experienced, doing right by the country is in the best interest of her legacy and therefore in hers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think so. Imagine multiple parallel universes - quantum leap style.  

All the parallel universes are lined up in a row so that you could slide between them flip book style.  When you flip between them, you are traversing the fourth dimension of the sphere mentioned above.

Now turn that row of parallel 3D universes into a sheet/plane of universes and you should be looking at 5D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes.  Look - no doubt op was making a racist remark.  My comment on the irony is simple:

1. op's text has no racial reference. 

2. respondent's text makes a racial reference.

3. I can prove respondent's racial stereotyping, but at best can only infer ops comment was racial. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be clear.  I agree, op is a racist shit hole. 

I was just being a grammar-nazi-esque douche trying point out the irony of the inference needed to understanding ops point.

Sorry for the kurffufle </TEXT>
