	<TEXT> There is a lot of frequency overlap in this. Some solid EQ would really free up some room to add more to the tune. It sounds lacking because sounds don't have their own 'space'. You'll find after EQing and mixing this that the tune either sounds a lot fuller, as each element shines through more, or has obvious ranges (frequencies) that are begging to be filled with something. 

I would start by cutting a lot of frequencies around the bass drum, or look into side chaining it to get the pulse feeling going.

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's a nice way to line up multiple transients etc with your beats, the solution for FL is to instead of adding markers to split your audio on the timeline, use stretch mode to adjust then merge it back into a single clip.

SliceX isn't half bad for it either// </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically, the game crashes after the launcher does its thing. I can start the game if I disable my AMD card via device manager however then it runs at 1FPS as it's using the onboard card.

People seem to be having the same problem with NVIDIA cards, their workaround is to disable the graphics card and then enable it again once the game has launched. This doesn't work for us AMD users as switching the card on after launching causes the game to crash :(

If anyone has any thoughts or workarounds I'd love to hear about it. I've tried the beta drivers, rolling back to HP drivers, verifying cache, updating bio, windows update.

Now switch your bpm to the lowest value and right click it - select copy value. Now right click on the left knob on the sequencer and - paste value.

Do this for the max value (max tempo) for the other knob. Alter the automation clip to either speed up, or cut straight to the higher BPM

	<TEXT> I have a launchkey and to be honest it's nothing amazing.

The knobs along the top wiggle a lot in their slots, which can make small adjustments annoying. The pads are average. The only other pads we use are on a maschine, so perhaps they're just not as good as those, but we don't like the launchkey ones.

The keys themselves are fine however, decently responsive and feel nice to play.

We picked the launchkey up for 110, and for that price it's still fair. Just know it might not be the top line quality you're expecting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, never in our experience would we send or receive DAW project files.

If we're sending stems for a remix we bounce each of our mixer tracks (making final sends for things like drums or other bus'd tracks) and bounce to wav.

We usually keep things like reverb sends as separate wavto keep the stems as clean as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yep, ours runs every 2 minutes. We were lucky enough to be able to host the email account on the same machine as the script - the script itself then pings another connector on our main systems.

We looked into writing a small daemon to check and ping but ended up using PHP for it all as it worked as promised :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done this before for a similar situation. PHP actually has a pretty robust imap/email system.

Here's a great composer package :)

https://github.com/barbushin/php-imap

Basically, set a cron to run a script which checks for new emails. In your case you could simply ~~explode()~~ str_getcsv() the message body and get a super sweet array:)

My friends either have their own place or share a 2-3 bedroom between a few friends. Either via agency or the landlord directly.

Sure, there's a lot of dodgy landlords who rent by the room and want to squeeze as much as they can. But that type of situation is not something half of London finds themselves in. </TEXT>
