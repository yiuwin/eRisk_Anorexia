	<TEXT> Hello and thanks, The crosses sort of just happen its something I just enjoy drawing, Purely stylistic ;) 
Then for the hatchings, hmm well its not really markings for colors its more about balance. For me drawing this style is like disarming a bomb that will go off any second, I just keep on drawing to balance it out until the bomb is secured. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, I works as a tattoo artist and this is not very suitable for a tattoo. However as this is my style I am able to change the drawings into something more tattoo-able if Im the one doing it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a hard banana to crack as one would say. 
I do a lot of different stuff that I dont share with the internet as its just regular drawings (All kinds of styles) . I also draw on weird objects like pipes and stuff but its not interesting to see that on pictures but it looks cool in real life. I really reaaaaally want to unlock the next level of this personal drawing style, but I just cant... yet. 
(I am secretly trying really hard to do it though)
I think it just needs to naturally happen.

	<TEXT> Let me tell you this, you are on the right track. The whole trick is to learn how to draw really well at first so you get that feeling of limitlessness and then you just get lucky and find your thing pretty much. Why I have stayed with this style is because it just naturally evolved from me. It feels like I put myself on paper when I do my drawings. I did try to write a blog 1 or 2 years ago that shows how I kind of started with this. The blog ends sort of abruptly haha... but I think you will find some interesting stuff to read in it. 
I write about stuff from 4 years ago but its still very relevant.

	<TEXT> This particular one was from just watching a bird while I was drinking coffee the same morning in a park. Usually I just try to empty my brain and draw as early in the morning as possible to be uninfluenced by my surroundings. But when I just cant figure something out I either go to a museum or something like that. As I live in Tokyo there is always something to get inspired by. </TEXT>
