	<TEXT> Thanks! I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. I've received some great tips here and I'm sure I'll noticed a difference when I change some of my stats and gear. I swap weapon sets all the time, and I use my pet efficiently. I think I'm in this weird low trait area at the moment. I'm almost level 50, and maybe once I get more traits things will get better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And that's why I came to this lovely community for help! I've had a few offers to watch me play. Perhaps that will be the best medicine. I think I could change up some stats and gear. Maybe try a different weapon or skill. But I feel like i'm not a total idiot out there. I have a plan when I attack, and I dodge and anticipate foes counter spells. The main problem is that I can't handle events alone and it seems that once I've killed a mob in an area that they are re-spawning so quickly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really useful tips. Thanks! I was riding smooth, until about level 40. That's when things started to get tougher and I just couldn't seem to keep up. I've been so partial to my longbow and great sword, but perhaps I need to switch that up. Thanks again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do have trinkets. They add to my power, precision, and toughness. I do use my traits, mainly in power. I've been told to steer clear of condition damage in this thread though. So, ? 

I use dodge constantly, guys. I can't seem to say this enough. Good tip, but i'm already all over that. I NEVER try to take on more than 3 foes at a time. My pet goes first and tanks, while I use my longbow. The problem is that things keep re-spawning while I'm still in a fight, thus adding multiple foes to my 2 or 3. That's when it gets overwhelming.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't go around pulling all the mobs. I try to slowly take them out one by one. I don't know why people think I'm just Leroy Jenkins-ing it up. I'm very cautious and I let my pet tank for the most part. It's when, say, I'm in a cave and I'm going through clearing. I kill about 5 foes in my area, and see some mushroom to gather. Before I'm done gathering, 5 more have re-spawned almost right on top of me. Then I just get overwhelmed by them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Playing my Ranger has been fine up until about level 40. It's a pretty simple character to play. I send in my pet to aggro, deal some damage, I stand back with my bow and that's usually all she wrote. But lately I just seem to be overwhelmed with foes. I'll go through a cave and clear our some skrit, but before I'm done killing the 3 in my area, 4 more have re-spawned. Sometimes right on top of me. That's when it gets tough, as I've already used most of my skills, spells and they're all recharging when the calvary arrives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good tips. I'll be upgrading my armor next level to get more power, ferocity, toughness. I'll try changing up my healing spells. I don't feel like I'm overly immobile. I stand back with my long bow, let my pet knock em down a few notches, then I'll swoop in with my great sword. I do just fine in most skirmishes, it's when there are just so many baddies, I can't take them all. They just seem to swarm and before I can finish killing them, more have re-spawned.

Perhaps it is the way I play. I just think it's weird that none of this was a problem until I reached about level 40.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a lvl 48 Ranger and no matter where I go (within my range or lower) I just keep getting my ass kicked. Am I basically force to partner with other players? It seems that everything aggros on me, not just one or two, but 6-10. Everything re-spawns so quickly that by the time I'm killing my last foe (having barely stayed alive) fresh baddies appear right on top of me. The game has become increasingly frustrating. I used to play alone and I leveled just fine, but over the past few levels I just can't keep from dying. Am I doing something wrong?

**Edit:** Here's a little bit about my Ranger. She loves to sing, enjoys long walks on the beach at sunset, and loves to drink.

Weapons: [Honed Iron Greatsword of Fire](http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/27513),
[Honed Soft Wood Longbow of the Hydromancer](http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/28518)

Pet: Bear/Wolf....Shark when aquatic BECAUSE ITS COOL

Skills:
Healing Spring,
Sic 'Em/Protect Me,
Rampage As One,
Lightning Reflexes, 
Call Wurm

Armor:
Honed Swindler Mask of Lyssa,
[Ravaging Privateer Shoulders of Lyssa](http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/976),
Ravaging Privateer Coat of the Dolyak,
[Ravaging Privateer Gloves of the Dolyak](http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/1970),
Ravaging Privateer Pants of Lyssa,
Ravaging Privateer Boots of the Dolyak

That's the basic setup. The areas that are giving me a hard time are Lornar's Pass (25-40) and where my story is leading me, Gendarran Fields (25-35), and Bloodtide Coast (45-55). 

I hope that clears a lot of things up for you guys. Thank you all for your help and care. You guys are awesome!

**Edit 2:** Just wanted to thank all of you for your help and suggestions. You are a gracious community!

	<TEXT> Oh man, that armor is cool. She has Drogon armor. I was reading the Princess and the Queen about the Targaryen civil war, and what I loved most about it were the Targ riders and their dragons in battle. It was so commonplace then to have dragons fighting, which seems so odd currently. I liked hearing about their armor, helms, saddles, etc. I really, really enjoyed this picture you made. She reminds me of the Targaryens of old. Well done! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I assumed the wolf showed up because of the blood trail Malvo had left. I like how Malvo looked at the wolf, as if he was recognizing the animal he is and related to the wolf/predator. I think he knew it'd be his end soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was so much intensity that entire episode. I was on the edge of my seat expecting the worse at any moment. She shot of Malvo when Lester runs away from the elevator, the shot that seems to be in the side bar is absolutely beautiful. The silhouette, the dead bodies, the blood spatter like a pair of angels wings. Even the long camera shot down the Vegas hotel hallway, shadows dancing all around them as they frantically run to the elevator... perfect. Just perfect. I love this show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always wondered this. There are so many other places/people that would seem like a better idea than kids in a school. But then again, most of the time the shooter is a kid which usually means peers. So sad. It's unbelievable how often this happens now. </TEXT>
