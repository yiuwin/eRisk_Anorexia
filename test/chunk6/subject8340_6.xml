	<TEXT> As a wrap second gear in my Volvo 1600, I think of the past with no future. It kills me to leave Carlton with Sandra without a note nor basket of meat. Fuck it. I have to know what is going on. My fingers I feel, are turning now. The grip of the transmission is so foreign. Is it me grabbing this? Is it the alien control? Do I see metal on my knuckles? Third gear and a pass 60 mph. Yes. I see metal. I see my jet on the ramp as I drive into Atlantic FBO at Teterboro. That Falcon 2000 was the best purchase I ever made. As I board the plane for the flight to Chile, I pull my gloves on to hide my hands not to alarm the pilots. It may be the last flight they take. </TEXT>

Weight is something that I cannot detect anymore due to my structure as a human body amassing titanium. It is not really titanium, it's the best I have to describe what is replacing my bones. It's more like a living organizim that is changing every cell in my body to a more defensive cell not needing white blood cells. I'm slowly becoming a metal man. How can I tell my wife and kids? Right now, it's only internal. If, or when this moves to my skin, I can no longer hide this freakish morph.  Dear Lord, make it stop! I didn't ask for this. I picked up a rock half way up Tupungato in Chile and this is my reward? The start of a freakish life where I must hide my self?...stay tuned. </TEXT>

In all my years of watching politics, I have never, ever, heard a sitting president say publicly, addressing the American people, that  he was gitting back at our advisary but it's so top secret, he can't tell us what it is. WTF? It's so juvenile, it's embarrassing. Most of the deals done, we never hear about, but this one is so sinister, so awesome, sooooo double top secret, he told us he can't tell us what it is.

	<TEXT> You are so right. I'm 47 yrs old and have been a registered Libertarian and have NEVER felt the way I do now about our President. We are in a change, a change that will destroy the Democratic party for a generation (40 years) and the Republicans if they don't get on board.  I'm reminded of "O Brother Where Art Thou" when Pappy O'Donnell realized on stage about the Foggy Bottom Boys and ran with it. The Republican party will be like the Democrats if they don't full throttle with him.  Politics will never be the same after this. Our two party system has been blown out of the water.  The Repubs made him sign an agreement not to run for third party with them "knowing" he would be Trump and squander his running within days. Now they are bound by him and they hate it. Why? He wasn't blessed by them. Now, he is the face of the Republican party and there are many in the party that hate that fact. He doesn't play by their rules. If they don't jump, they will be cut out like cancer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Use a dark roast to an espresso roast whole bean. If you don't have a burr grinder, put it on a Christmas list. You can pick up a Krupp for about $60. Make sure it's a burr and not a blade. A blade grinder pulverizes the bean into chips and dust where a burr has a very consistent grind throughout. Grind your beans at a very course grind. I'm not sure what size press you have so I'm not able to tell you how much beans to use. Heat your water to about 205f or when the water is hissing. Put you fresh ground beans in the press and fill up your press with the water about half way and let it sit for about 5 min stirring once (if it's a glass press, us a wood spoon). Take the remaining water and top off your press and press the plunger.

Either your beans are light, old or pre-ground. Tha it's your problem.  </TEXT>
