	<TEXT> I'm new to this and I just wanted to know a couple of things: Does essentials comes with the original towns and cities by default? 

And is it possible to create tutorial battles with the professor? (like in the original games) 

Thank you  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for this! If it gets to hard to find I suppose Gen II could suffice. Though I did find this video where this spanish guy managed to make a custom Gen I game using 'gamemakerstudio'? it was on this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-dNyogjFqc 
Though it's pretty hard to follow as it's in spanish after all...  </TEXT>
