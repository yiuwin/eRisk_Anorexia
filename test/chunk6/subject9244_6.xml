	<TEXT> Getting this out of the way: the dude knocked a girl half his size out cold. I don't care what the surrounding circumstances are. That's a problem. I don't see how investigating, hoping to be able to say with a straight face, "Well she provoked him, so it isn't as bad as it looks," does anyone any good, most of all the player.

As far as I'm concerned any investigation should be directed at gauging how remorseful the player is, adn more importantly, what he has done and is currently doing to get help. Make your decision on whether you can handle his character issues based on that.

How can they best get the player (and victim, if DV) help, and create a workplace environment to foster that. UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE. And that it *is* an issue; don't make excuses for the player. The logistics, well, that's above my expertise, but it's clear the league and its teams aren't doing a great job at that right now, and that probably has something to do with excuse-making and the fact that all this shit is just a PR game to them.

	<TEXT> The big earners are predominantly huge blockbusters that likely would have made the same amount of money regardless of the cast's diversity. Would fewer people have seen The Force Awakens if Finn were played by Alden Ehrenreich instead of John Boyega?

I don't really see what you're getting at...Are you implying that a large portion of the diverse films are blockbusters (and following along, big network TV shows)? Do you have any proof of that?

Also, how confident are you really that blockbusters aren't reactive to this reported correlation? *If 'Star Wars' had a less diverse cast, would the same amount of people have bought tickets for it?* I'd guess no, honestly. </TEXT>

Either way The Good Wife was always kind of a niche show so it makes sense to put a spinoff that might have an already-established fanbase on a pay service.

It does make sense, but is one niche show enough to launch All Access successfully? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The questions a person might have: Did this person watch the show or is he indifferent towards the premise?

Post title: "Big Little Lies -- Series Premiere Discussion" A person has an answer!

 Why is this person indifferent?

This person doesn't fully know at the moment why he's indifferent, hence the absence of further analysis.

You want some half-baked shit right after watching the episode, of which part may be true to me, but also part parroting common critiques I've heard before, and part contrived bullshit? I could probably do that. But what if I don't? What if I only give my overall impression, which I know to be true, and let others forming their opinion on the show only be influenced by that? edit: grammar </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends how they're told -- look at *Transparent* for a well-done version -- but I think it's a few things: (1) These shows are everywhere. TV has done nothing if not disproportionately house the stories of very well-off white people, in the name of aspiration. (2) It's not always easy for viewers to empathize with "problems" that they themselves would jump at the opportunity to have.

	<TEXT> As Poniewozik wondered aloud on Twitter, I'm too curious to see how many of the show's viewers will be people who didn't watch *The Good Wife*. I'd guess not many, but who knows...Anyone here watch *Better Call Saul* without having seen *Breaking Bad*, or know of anyone that did? edit: clarity </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We did often, still, IIRC. But to the degree that it decreased it was due to Ish, and his diminutive stature. He's a tiny 5-11, 175 lbs, which isn't going to match up well vs. most 2s or 3s. He's more than 30 lbs lighter and has 7-8 inches less wingspan than Jackson. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sounded like that's what Lowe thinks they should do, at least partially, but the Pistons would refuse. New arena, playoff mandate and all

I agree with that, though. There's not much upside with this group, and they're about to enter the tax. I'm not saying trade Drummond, but get Stanley involved more, try and aim for a pick around 10 in this upcoming stacked draft. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Caldwell-Pope also does that because he's *really* good at it. He's one of the best individual PG-defenders in the NBA. Combine that with Reggie having the size/length to match up against 2s and it makes a lot of sense, even without factoring in Jackson's overall caliber defensively.

If KCP wasn't crossmatching on the plethora of PGs that dominate the NBA today he wouldn't be nearly as valuable a player. I doubt he'd want that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll agree, it doesn't make a ton of sense on the surface; and this is coming from a guy who doesn't think as much of Ebron as probably most here. I'm just saying, that's what's out there right now, from multiple analysts (Jeremiah is as respected as they come, draft-wise, and has lots of legit connections; Risdon's all-too-eager-to-offer rumors I take with a huge grain of salt), and anything is possible. If the Lions have a really solid plan in place to reform their offensive system to one based predominantly out of 12-personnel sets ([not too common these days](https://www.instagram.com/p/BO6Gzr1DwgU/)), there might be a way to make this work. If they do it, Howard makes far more sense than Njoku given the former's blocking ability, but I'm just short of completely ruling it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He'll be cheap, sign him up and see what he can offer. He's up to 255 lbs now, is still young, and has some talent. No, he's not a blocking TE, but the Lions will damn sure have room for useful players if he can prove himself as that, in his role.

P.S. I refuse to believe that he's a worse blocker than Eric Ebron, who has to be the worst blocking tight end I have ever seen at the NFL level. (I think that more than anything is driving this TE-need talk surrounding the Lions.) </TEXT>
