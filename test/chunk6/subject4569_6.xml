	<TEXT> I prefer to wear a minimally scented, roll on deodorant. That way I can just add cologne if I want or I can just not smell like an armpit even if I don't wear cologne.

If you just do cologne without deodorant I think there's a potential for it to smell like someone sprayed cologne in a room full of onions. </TEXT>
