	<TEXT> An over complicated vocabulary.

Having a large functional vocabulary is great but if you are pulling out seven 10$ words every sentence, just to look smart, you are going to look like an ass. Your readers will struggle to read your work and if you are not already a well-respected author, they will wonder why they should bother getting a headache over your writing and just give up. 

I mean, there *are* rare times to use overly-complicated language but it's extremely rare.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seemed exactly like Facebook but less personal and with a character limit. I didn't understand the function of a hashtag for the longest time. I didn't know you could follow someone without them having to accept it first so to me it was the same as a fb friend request. It felt like they were trying to reinvent the wheel.

I understand the difference now but I still have no purpose for it personally. Now you can follow people on fb and use Hashtags (I understand them now!) but I think (possibly?) fb added that later to compete with Twitter? I'm 28 for reference.

Still my husband is 38 and he uses it all the time to create add revenue for side-money. Sooo I'm old at heart I guess.  </TEXT>

I know if anyone else found out it might mean Jon being killed, but I thought she could have been trusted with it. Now that I'm re-watching the show I'm not so sure. Would she have been able to endure the whispers about her and her husband and hold her tongue?

Ned was such an upstanding guy he must have really not trusted her to ruin his reputation over it. Or maybe they were young and he didn't know her well enough yet? What do you think? </TEXT>

Pros

-You get paid to write, which is not something many people can claim.

-You are often writing in big volume so you get a lot of practice. 

-You get to brag that you've published a book

Cons

-Your name doesn't go on anything so you can't brag *too* much.

-Your deadlines are usually really close so be ready to pull some long nights. 

-You rarely get to write what you want to write. 

-The pay is incredibly, laughably, bad, So don't quit your day job. (I'm sure some ghostwriters can make a living off it, but I can't.

-Unlike the "real" authors, you are treated like you are expendable.

	<TEXT> I'm a professional ghostwriter and I just copied and pasted 2,000 words from what I'm working on and got an over all 8th grade level with a score of 74. 

Honestly, don't get too upset about it. Writing overly complicated stuff means it's harder for the average person to read. Unless you are writing your doctorate or something hyper technical you don't want a super highs score. 

Having an average score doesn't mean you write poorly or have a poor vocabulary it means you communicate effectively with the average target demographic. Writing overly complicated sentences with extremely obscure words (when it's unnecessary) is for people who want to show off.  </TEXT>

You try not to judge too harshly yet you mention daddy issues, sex addiction, pervertedness, and sugar daddies. Is it at all possible in your mind that these two consenting adults could be perfectly happy and healthy?  Sure the mom is worried but that's the only thing we have to go on. This guy could be a creep or he could be perfectly fine. The only thing you are making assumptions about is in reference to the age difference. How narrow minded can you be?  </TEXT>

had to look it up myself because I always thought it meant pretty in an artsy kind of way but I wasn't sure. I never use the term myself I was just trying to figure out what the guy was attempting to say. 

I thought it meant like beautiful and grand, like the kind of person you would model a statue after.

	<TEXT> I don't know for sure, but if I had to guess on a gut reaction, I would say that many women say this to men because they believe that by agreeing with the social stigma that all women are (crazy, emotional, dramatic, illogical, what-have-you) they can then have something in common with men. 

I realize all men don't think these things about women but the social stigma is that they do. Women who are interested in men (as a potential love interest or just friends) want to distinguish themselves from this stereotype and instead of coming off like a "crazy militant feminist" by saying "hey I know society paints women in a poor light but I, as well as many of my sisters are pretty cool" they say "I'm not like other girls. I don't get along with them."

Do some critical thinking leg work. If you look at the definition I posted of race and you are talking about an assumption made about people that falls under that definition then yes, I think it's racist.

I'm not seeing people saying "I hate the assholes In Brazil" in this thread either, I'm seeing people saying "fuck Brazil" and "fuck Brazilians" and making huge blanked statements about *all* of Brazil and its inhabitants as a WHOLE. I hate asshole Brazilians too, but I also hate asshole Americans and asshole Canadians and asshole (insert any country here). I hate assholes not Brazilians. There's a huge difference between hating assholes and implying that all Brazilians are assholes. 

And yes, the meaning of racism in this sort of context is admittedly highly contested, but there's the definition right there so I'm not wrong in calling it racism and yes, by the definition it's not wrong to call people who hate all Americans racist or to consider nazis a race of people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do not but I know how to write and read it. I've been told (and believe) that it is faster to write in cursive but I'm so rusty at it, it would most likely take me, personally, longer than to print. 

The school district I work in still teaches cursive, but honestly, if it were up to me I would teach typing instead if speed were the only reason to teach it. I'm open to the idea that there are other practical uses for cursive but I personally can't think of any, but I'm open to someone changing my mind. 

Most people that argue for it that I've met usually say we should keep teaching it because they learned it and so did their parents, or because "it's pretty." To me that's not a good enough reason.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was raised in a cult and wasn't allowed to as a child but I remember wanting to quite a lot. 

Yeah I already knew all the spoilers when I did end up reading it and I still enjoyed the series immensely. I also knew Darth Vader was Luke's father before watching Star Wars, so I agree that after a period of time spoiler tags are no longer necessary, like now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been on the opposite end. My daughter  nearly died at the age of two and was in the hospital. Once she stabilized I went back to work. It was WAY too soon but I was a single mom and I needed the money. 

I'm a substitute teacher and on my first day back I did everything I was supposed to do, but I felt on the edge of tears the entire day and came off like an emotionless zombie. The teacher I was subbing for came back at the end of the day and after the final bell rang and all the kids were gone, he asked me how my day was and I just burst into tears and word-vomited my life story about why I was a single mom and why I had to be at work while my kid was in he hospital. Poor guy, he was super sweet about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who is suffering a severe bout of depression, the only way I feel comfortable reaching out to my friends now is through Facebook and it helps me a lot. I might not want to be around anyone but I still want to talk to them. 

My dog died two days ago and I'm still reeling from the loss, but posting in Facebook about it and having such a huge outpouring of sympathy and love from the people that knew him really helped me a lot. 

Maybe I like it more because I have around 70 friends instead of 1,000 so I genuinely care about most of them.  </TEXT>

I mean come on, SOMEONE is going to have to teach your kids, you have to see that we're necessary! I realize they don't get paid a whole lot but I'm tired of being treated like I was dropped on my head for caring less abut making gobs of money and more about doing what I love. </TEXT>

I was not allowed to read them when they came out. I adore the series now but it took me so long to get around to kit because of you are an adult who was never exposed to HP, getting around to it might be low on your priority list and take a while.

	<TEXT> Yeah the cursive argument gets on my nerves, although I would like to point out that cursive, if taught, is not taught as it's own subject but rather, a section of an already existing subject. So you would not have to give cursive it's own hour (or however your school divides up the subjects) but it would take up a section of another subject. You might, for example, end up spending time on cursive and less on printing or sentence structure in a writing class. 

I still think cursive is relatively worthless and the best arguments I hear involve phrases like "it's pretty!" or "Well, *I* was taught it!". I think writing in cursive is considered to be a little bit faster, but in this day and age, if that's the only real reason to keep it, it would be better to teach typing. 

Source: Almost done with my master's in special education, substitute teacher for 4 years, my school district still teaches cursive and I don't like it.

	<TEXT> Not nearly as bad, but I had  just got out of a bad relationship and went over to a friends house to watch movies and bitch. One of her friends who I had never met came over unexpectedly to hang out with her too. He was really sweet and funny in a shy/awkward neck-beard sort of way, but at the time, I was the female equivalent of a neck-beard too. 

We stayed up all night watching movies and laughing and getting along. The next day my friend called me saying that he had asked her for my number and if I wanted to go out on a date. I politely said no because I wasn't ready (as I thought he knew since I spent the whole previous night talking about how I was done with dating for a while). She said she would tell him and let him down easy. She also mentioned how it was too bad because he had depression issues and was having a pretty hard time lately and felt like he was undesirable to everyone. 

Within 24 hours she called me crying that they had found him parked in the desert with a gunshot wound to he head. I barely knew him and I know it's not my fault but I still felt so so so shitty about it. Even worse it's been six years and I don't remember his name anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My answer is anecdotal from my own experience. My cult leader never admitted to being wrong or lying but I don't think he bought all his bullshit either. I think for him it was somewhere In the middle.

Did he actually believe was a mouth piece for God? Yes.  And he obviously got many other people to believe it. I also think on some level he is aware that he exploited this for his own personal gain. 

Maybe he thought he really was ordained by God and could see sin in people without them disclosing it to him, but he also tended to "see" really bad sins In people when they were getting In his way or pushing back on something he wanted. His "power" was extremely convenient for him.

I have no doubt he knowingly faked revelations and dreams but I also think he legitimately thought God was working through him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think being In a cult, in many cases, makes it easier to fall into other cults because cults feed on people who are damaged and/or insecure. 

I'm not arguing with you I'm just saying that the fact that he helps someone in the video who was In a cult , says nothing (to me) one way or another about whether his following is a cult or not. 

I want to stress that I'm not arguing with you I'm just not convinced either way. Maybe he is genuinely a fantastic dude. I also know most cult leaders are really good at coming off like fantastic people. That doesn't mean all fantastic people are cult leaders, it just does not convince me either way. 

The sheer cost of going to one of these seminars throws me off a bit too. Sure, the guy has to make money, but the cost of some of his seminars and classes are hovering In the ludicrously expensive range. Makes me question how pure his motivation really is. Once again, that doesn't mean he is a cult leader.

The walking on coals, breaking boards, breaking up relationships after talking to one person For two min, and calling men feminine if they are not dominant enough really shook me up though.   </TEXT>

It's insane, everyone in the show claims to see people being "set free" through "tough love" and all I can see is insanely harmful manipulation facilitated by mob mentality (which is exactly how my childhood cult leader operated.) 

I mean this lady who was forced to break up with her BF on speaker phone over a microphone in front of thousands of people (not the same woman as the story you posted but just as bad) is interviewed days later and she is talking about how happy and free she is now and her eyes look completely hollow and dead inside and she's crying.

	<TEXT> My fianc has casually read a few of Tony Robins' books and listened to a few of his tapes and generally thinks he is a pretty good motivational speaker. I had no experience with him. So last night we watched "Tony Robins: Not your guru" on Netflix. My fianc seemed to think it was pretty cool and inspiring. Meanwhile ALL my cult-leader bells were going off. 

I was raised in a cult so sometimes I wonder if I'm just super sensitive. Still, toward the beginning where he practically forces a woman to break up with her boyfriend on speaker phone in front of thousands of people... It made me physically sick with anxiety. 

Can someone watch it and tell me if I'm just being nuts?

Now I can't relax if my house is beyond a certain level of messy. Even when I'm free I sometimes feel  like there is something I *should* be doing. It gets slowly worse over time. My house is getting cleaner, my responsibilities are growing and getting taken care of more promptly. Also, if you fuck up in the same way that you used to in your early 20's, you are WAY harder on yourself for it. 

Shit, now I know why my mom couldn't even sit and watch a movie without having to iron or patch holes in clothes or knit or *something* . She HAD to be productive.

So do 3D movies and lots of motion in movies (even some 2d movies). So, no concerts for me. No clubs (but I hate clubbing anyway).  I vomited in every transformers movie (and they were in 2D) just because in EVERY one, the theater had the volume blown out and there was an explosion every 15 seconds. (I hated those movies but my ex husband bullied me into every single one of them.)

I know it's something but at this point it's just easier for me to avoid loud situations than try and get a diagnosis and meds.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, but I'd rather be with people. It helps that I rarely go to the theater so I only end up in maybe 1-2 3D movies a year. Vomiting is also not such a big deal for me because a lot of things make me nauseous. (bad motion sickness, extended loud noises (can't go to concerts), certain foods with too much acidity) so I throw up like once a week and it stops being more than a minor inconvenience. The biggest problem is missing little parts of the movie to go vomit. (I know, I'm super fun/ s)

I saw ghost-busters in 3D two days ago and although i got nauseous I actually didn't puke, so I think if the movie has less movement in it, I can handle it better (as opposed to a marvel movie).  </TEXT>

Yes, I can just NOT go to 3D movies, but then you are forcing the people you are going with to see 2D. There are less options about what times are available (at least where I live) for 2D movies too. 

I realize my wish is selfish though so I'm not doing anything about it. Saw Winter Soldier in 3D, and even though I threw up three times it was an excellent movie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been arrested two times in two different states (both related to possession of weed). Whether you agree with weed or not, one thing I can say was in BOTH cases I was jailed for 3-4 days without my medication after the doctor (nurse?) that sees everyone, promised me I would get my meds and assured me that they knew how vital they were. 

In one case I fainted and they put me in lock-down for it (only for about six hours but still) and recieved no medical follow-up evaluation after. In neither case did I receive my meds before I got out. On the other case, I was put on lock-down for about 12 hours because I held down the button next to the speaker in my cell when I first got there instead of hitting it once and waiting for a reply. See, i thought it worked like a walkie-talkie that you had to hold the button down to talk but it turns out holding it down just made it keep beeping on their end. So for 15-20 seconds of beeping, I was silenced and ignored, locked in my cell for 12 hours even though I explained my mistake. I've seen a girl get locked down for looking out the window of her cell. The entire way they treat people in jail (not even prison, jail) is disgusting. 

In both cases I was extremely polite and respectful. I'm well educated, articulate and white so I can't imagine how badly other people are treated, or those who are accused of less publically acceptable crimes. 

In both cases I was treated like a piece of human garbage with no rights who they would sooner abuse than listen to or acknowledge.  

My heart breaks for this woman in the story, but am I surprised? No.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think i struggled because I wasn't invested. I don't know if being female had anything to do with it (I know plenty of women who have vastly different tastes in books, so maybe it's not really a gender thing) but when I first read TG, I was like "Oh, look at the stoic bad-ass. Typical hard cowboy with a 2D personality. I get it, you're hard. You can shoot 100 people in a town in under 5 min with impossible shots. I get it. Woop de do!" And I didn't care about his quest because I was given almost nothing to go on about it. Rolland was also pretty unlikable for me as a character until I discovered exactly how and why he had become the person he was. Then he became totally 3D and I could fully sympathize with him and his stand-offish nature. I remember even getting angry in book two when King had Roland lose some fingers because then, not only was he an asshole, but he was less useful and even less likable.  I'm one of those people who likes everything put out in a neat little row for me at the start of the book so I can give a shit immediately. That habit was broken from me with these books because they string you along. At first it annoyed me but what I didn't realize was that it left room for me to be surprised by a book, which was not something that had happened for me in a long time. 

I think if SK had put everything out there (back story and such) from the beginning, it would have sucked me in faster, but ultimately been a less satisfying and unpredictable series. He did what he did, and he did it well.  That's why I had to ultimately resign myself to "just go with it" rather than feel like I was missing some big part of the story and trying to tease a narrative out of a book that just wasn't ready to give it to me yet. That was frustrating for someone who always *needs* to know everything and get instant satisfaction. 

This series helped break me of that rut. It's like showing a basketball player how to shoot a free-throw properly after a decade of doing it wrong. They might get worse at first, and not like it, but it makes it better in the long run breaking that bad habit.  

EDIT: Basically the later books gave me a reason to *care* about all the cool things that happened in the first books because I wanted to know back story and motivation. Maybe the first few books were the best in the series but I couldn't care about the people or the story until I learned why they were doing it in the first place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha yeah. That's what I mean. Every time someone on Reddit (and even my friend) talks about the DT series they always loved the books I liked the least and didn't like the ones I liked as much. Everyone is confused or bored by SOS though, from what I have seen. I'll admit though The Gunslinger way waaaaay better for me the second time around. I didn't re-read the whole series, just that one because I wanted to get the wheel rolling again to complete the picture.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually read Wind Through the Keyhole before Wolves as part of the series. I think because I read it as part of the series instead of an add-on, it felt "in it's place" as part of the cannon rather than a side story, much like Wizard and Glass. I can see how it would work perfectly either way though. It's like a side quest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **For TL;DR, read the text that is in bold**

**I feel like my experience reading the series was a lot different than many others I have read on Reddit. I wanted to talk about my experience reading it and why you should finish it if you are struggling.** 

The Gunslinger was my first SK book. My reading buddy suggested we read it after I mentioned picking up a series to read. He had heard good things about it and was already a SK fan so I agreed. 

**I didn't hate The Gunslinger but I felt bored and completely uninvested. If it had just been me I would not have kept reading.** Still, my buddy loved it so I pressed on with him. I liked the second book even less. I just kept wondering the entire time "where the fuck is this going?!" by the end of book two, I had resigned myself to stop trying to reason with why all this insane shit was happening and just follow along and accept it. Don't reason out the crazy, just accept it and keep going. 

Having accepted this, in book three I found myself going through periods where I could not put the damn book down and lulls where I was wondering why the hell I was still reading this series. I was intoxicated by how unpredictable  the book was. All this time I never realized there was a hunger in me for a story line that I could not see coming 1,000 miles away. Now I was getting hooked to the feeling of feeding this hunger, but still could not say one way or another if I was *enjoying* the book itself. 

Wizard and Glass was the book where I decided I would stop reading if it didn't hook me halfway through. Luckily it did. I finally became invested in Roland's cause. As I kept reading on, this investment spread to Jake, Eddie and Susannah. Suddenly I loved them all because I finally became invested and I already had all of their character development from the previous books to back it up. I enjoyed Wolves immensely and Wind through the Keyhole further won me over to, not only Roland, but the world they were in and the lore surrounding it. 

I'll admit, Song of Susannah was hard. It was necessary though. It was like the frame to a beautiful painting. Necessary but the least interesting part of the art. I'd still call it alright though. In this book I flopped to caring about the story *because* I cared about the characters instead of the other way around. 

The seventh book was magnificent. If I had to pick a favorite it might still be Wolves or Wizard and Glass, but the seventh book will always hold a holy place in my heart because it ended the series and changed my perspective. Let me explain how with this anecdote ....

After I had finished reading the series, my boss asked me "is it a good series? Should I read it? What's it like?" And I thought for a while and said:

**Reading this series is like staring at a giant pointillism painting three inches from your face. You painstakingly scan and memorize every dot and every pretty color. You learn to appreciate it even if you might not understand it fully, or know where it is going. You become intimately familiar with every part of it. Then, right at the end, Stephen King pulls you 10 feet back and say "look". And you see it. You see the whole thing. You see that all those little dots really did come together to create something magnificent and enormous. You also have a deeper appreciation for it because you knew every intimate detail of the painting before the whole canvas was revealed to you. It's a fucking masterpiece but it takes a lot of work to recognize. Still, once you do, it can bring you to your knees.**

So although I think Wolves or Wizzard and Glass might have been my favorite individual books, I will always love the seventh book the most because I got to see the whole painting at the end. 

**So for those of you wondering if you should finish the series (either because it's long or that someone told you the last books are not as good) my own personal answer is yes. God yes. You'll never appreciate the magnitude of the full piece until you do.**

**It's funny, after I finished the series, I went back and read The Gunslinger. I fucking loved it.**

Really? Jamie Lanister is the best sword on game of thrones? Barristan Selmy Is number nine UNDER Stannis? UNDER Brienne?! Not only that but Brienne is drastically under Jamie and the hound whom she defeated both in combat?

	<TEXT> Wow, everyone here is talking about rich people. I on the other hand, had a friend in high school who was a pathological liar who genuinely seemed to believe his own lies. 

He claimed to have a play station 4 that he was testing for playstation, but none of us could see it or play it because it violated his contract with them. This was in 2004. 

He also claimed that he was a ninja assassin hired by the government to carry out hits. After the hit they would wipe his memory and he would think he had slept all night, but he would have repressed memories of the killings and his expert ninja martial arts. He also claimed he could never show us any moves because he only knew them when his code words were said.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For sure, though I specifically mean that the gym chain "planet fitness" tends to get a bad rap in the fitness community. It's usually only 10$ a month and their marketing is that it's a "judgement free zone" where people of all fitness levels can exercise without it being intimidating. They also discourage brutish behavior that takes place in more "serious" gyms. Because of this, serious fitness nuts think it's a lame gym for casuals, but it's actually really nice.  </TEXT>

Honestly? I love it. I've been going there for two years now. Love the atmosphere, the people are polite. It's clean and nice. It's affordable as hell. Even if I could go to any gym in my city for free, i'd go there.  </TEXT>

As you can see, it didn't change all THAT much, but I would still recommend waiting at least that long before you see what the end result might be. Still, that doesn't mean you have to wait that long. After the first year I saw little difference. I wish I could afford the surgery.  </TEXT>
