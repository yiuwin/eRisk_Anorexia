	<TEXT> My current driver is customized for the PC I bought, so when I tried installing the latest one from [your link](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/98909/Intel-HD-Graphics-630), it said I couldn't, because it wasn't updating the manufacturer's device. Intel also has a Driver Update Utility thing that said the same thing.

It looks like my only options at this point are to attempt to delete the manufacturer's driver and install the generic Intel one, which is kind of risky and most likely will still not allow me to play the game, or buy a new graphics card, which I'm not motivated enough to do right now.

Bummed that I can't play this game because of a small detail like Dedicated VRAM (it runs quickly and sounds great otherwise, but I kind of need textures to see what I'm doing), but maybe this will help someone else.

Thanks for your help!

	<TEXT> So you think a recent update is what caused the resolution issue? </TEXT>

[CanIRunIt.com Diagnosis](http://imgur.com/a/dvwIK)

Computer Specs:

* Acer Aspire TC-780 Signature Edition
* Windows 10
* Intel Core i5-7400 CPU @ 3GHz x4
* 64-Bit Operating System
* Intel HD Graphics 630
* 8GB RAM

I've updated the video card driver to the latest version (11/16) and restarted my computer, as well as the application, every time I changed settings. Nothing seems to be changed to any textures whatsoever.

Is Dedicated Video RAM really the problem here? I've got plenty of AAA games from the last 10 years installed that run just fine. Not to mention my graphics card has 8GB of available RAM.

I'm not sure I understand why this would cause the issue or what else I can do, so please enlighten me if you know.

Thank you!
