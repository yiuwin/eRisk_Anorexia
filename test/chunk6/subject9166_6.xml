Middle class and urban Indians aren't shitting in streets, but people who've spent their childhood just going out in the morning into a farm, doing their business and coming back are.

	<TEXT> Things I loved:

1. The plot gets a 10/10 for me. Maybe the pacing was a bit iffy in the first half. It's really noticeable because here in Indian theatres they cut it off at half-time for an interval. And that really made me notice that hey, almost none of the things I saw in the trailer have happened yet. But after it got resumed it felt very comfortable, and in retrospect I think the first half COULD be better in terms of pacing but still it builds up calmly and it pays off well too. 

2. After they go to Siberia I was very interested to see how they'd divide Cap and Iron-Man and give us the 2 v 1 beat down, because it seemed like they were going for the "greater evil" thing. But they handled it perfectly. 
Robert Downey Junior's acting really knocked it out of the park imo. The final fight was so intense. Tony losing and then shouting at Cap to leave the shield because he didn't deserve it....just had me really involved emotionally. Really felt like Cap would kill him there for a sec. Well done.

3. All the Black Panther/Spider-Man scenes were 10/10. Tony standing there with his hand webbed to the door knob got me laughing so much. 

4. Bucky/Falcon interactions were the funniest scenes in the movie. 

5. The Dean's cameo lmao shame that I don't think even one other person in my theatre noticed it.

6. I liked how they handled Zemo. His plan worked after all. The scene with him and Black Panther was moving, and made you feel for the guy. 

Things I didn't like:

1. The action scenes were NOT as good as The Winter Soldier, barring that final act. Some scenes at the start were just shoddy, especially the ones involving Black Widow. Shaky cam, quick cuts, seeing her back whenever she faught, etc. 

2. The score...I can't remember one thing about it or one scene where I liked it. Unlike Winter Soldier where I walked out humming that main theme. 

3. The "We're still friends, right?" Barton-Widow interaction may seem funny at first but to me it was kinda weird and I think it should NOT have been there. Like why are you even fighting then? Is this play-fighting? Are you sparring for show? Really kind of cheapens the fight and lessens the gravity.

The lowest point imo was Half Blood Prince. And maybe DHP1 as well somewhat. 1/2/3/4/7.2 were solid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kilgrave is THE best Marvel villain imo.

	<TEXT> I absolutely love this aspect of the story, the sacrifice the 'good guy' Dumbledore is prepared to make for the great good, that is, Harry himself. In lines like these I see that Dumbledore is genuinely fond of Harry and so the burden of knowing what must be done must be so great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that laptop speakers differ most in their low end capabilities. So you need to really sacrifice the low end or compress/EQ it correctly so that it eats up the minimum amount of headroom whilst still sounding good on earphones. 
Low end eats up volume on laptop speakers like nothing else. Also I dont think many people listen to music on laptop speakers (only sometimes) so dont sweat if your shit doesnt sound perfect on it. </TEXT>
