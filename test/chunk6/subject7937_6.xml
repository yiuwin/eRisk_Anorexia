	<TITLE> The Lost Sinner Lore. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-06 08:53:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I can't seem to find a concrete theory about *who* the Lost Sinner is and *what* was the sin she(?) committed. 

The Souls of Lost Sinner description says:

Soul of the Lost Sinner,
prisoner of Sinner's Rise.

The Lost Sinner eternally punishes herself
for the sins of her past.

The mask description states:

Mask of the Lost Sinner. The spikes pointing inward suggest that this was not only used to blind prisoners, but to torture them as well.

So it's clear she's punishing herself for something.

Also in the cutscene we see a bug crawl into her mask which looks exactly like the Chaos Bug of Dark Souls 1. Also if you use a bonfire ascetic or fight her in NG+ pyromancers pop out in the arena and after defeating her we get a Soul of an Old Witch. So is there any sort of connection between The Lost Sinner and the Witch of Izalith and The Chaos Daughters? Was trying to recreate the first flame *the sin*? 

Or is it just a subtle reference to Dark Souls 1? 

I would love to here your thoughts guys!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel you man. I have just started my playthrough. Done with Lost Sinner. And it's now that the rolls are slightly manageable. And shields, there truly are no early game good shield. I may well do this playthrough a no shield one as I have not used any shield until now and don't think will do later either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 3 years back I was a casul gamer. I had no idea Dark Souls even existed. So one day I just randomly googled "Best Games Since 2010". Somewhere in the list I saw a game named "Dark Souls: PtDE".
Now I thought it would resemble "Darksiders" . Boy was I wrong. And then after about 5 months with Dark souls I was in love and no more a casul. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also I really don't understand why everything is fast rolling in DS3. I mean fast roll is the way to go but the Knight armor gotta have some weight. And in 2 I don't really enjoy the leveling up adaptability thing. Rolling was really balanced in ds1 for me. Except the 4 way roll when locked on. </TEXT>
