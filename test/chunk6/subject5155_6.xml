	<TEXT> The decibel recording was faulty. Anything is super noisy if you record it from that close. The trouble with decibel recording is that there's [no standardized distance](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1me358/is_there_a_standard_distance_for_measuring/) for measuring.

(Use your intuition -- the bags are loud, but not as loud as a diesel grassmower. One of these you can hear very well from a block away, the other you can't.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's mostly an analogy for the non-linear storytelling, with the major plotpoints being the larger triangles. It was kind of an off-hand remark in the interview (I think it was with Charlie Rose?) and I wouldn't read too much into it. 

I don't think that framing the novel in terms of a Sierpinski Triangle reveals anything that is not otherwise apparent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note that the literature may not strictly be *untrue*. That would imply that the inverse of the result is true. I think a better term to use would be *unconfirmed*: most of the results in the scientific literature simply do not have sufficient statistical evidence supporting their theses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In February 2010 I was investing in niche markets. A friend of mine told me that this Bitcoin thing was pretty cool and maybe I should mine or buy some. The first exchange had just gone live, and Bitcoins were well under a penny each, at the time. I checked it out. Didn't really believe in it because of the scaling difficulties. Never bothered mining or buying any. 

This isn't really a mistake or blunder, just a regret. In expected value my decision was probably correct -- if I threw money at every vaguely interesting thing that came along, I would lose all my money pretty quickly. This was just the rare time that the interesting thing ended up being a big deal and I missed out on 100,000x+ returns. However, I should've seen that BTC would probably generate sufficient interest/hype for it to appreciate a little bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did too. Once you suspend your disbelief, there's something really entertaining about how the events in the movie are cast as utterly mundane. The film is funny and ironic, but without being preachy or obsessed with its own cleverness. In a way, that's what's refreshing about it: it's a fairly satirical and self-aware film, but it does not pretend to be *clever*. And because the central premise is that *there is no plot*, it becomes difficult to predict what happens next -- which makes it more exciting to follow the tire around! I was entertained. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently github just rolled out an update that lets you pin any 5 repositories to your profile, instead of showing 5 personal + 5 contributed repositories. 

I think the previous interface was better. This new one offers far less information. The long panel for "pinned repositories" also looks kind of awkward, I think. </TEXT>

Beyond that, it's not "better for consumers" in the sense that these streaming sites don't try to actually improve their technology, but just to get exclusive deals that effectively force consumers to use them, as opposed to the competition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree somewhat. Bitcoin does not have the accessibility or volume to accommodate large-scale capital flight. Thus, I think you're likely overestimating its importance in this scenario. But if China's economy experiences some kind of pullback, then Bitcoin will likely appreciate (I'm just not sure how much). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Buying a NYC apartment is not that bad of an idea -- the real estate market for apartments in Manhattan is likely to stay strong for (at least) another decade, and NYC can offer a great quality of life. Assuming that your acquaintance could afford HOA fees, if applicable, and taxes out of pocket, then that's not a bad situation to be in, even if they have to work in order to cover their lifestyle. I definitely know people for whom this lifestyle would be preferable to, say, using the capital to retire to Minneapolis. </TEXT>
