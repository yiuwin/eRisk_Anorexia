	<TEXT> The second art will receive the damage buff and the lowered cooldown too, it's part of the melee combo. Fast Forward and Supreme Sword are really good for the conditions needed to activate them. Even though Fast Forward can be replaced by Secondary Accelerator if you have some basic control over Overdrive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Per my understanding, a melee combo is simply stringing together two or more arts that are linked to your melee weapon in rapid succession. Of course, your art may have already been at 50% cooldown because of overdrive or some external factor. Granted, if you are in overdrive, you may want to consider Secondary Accelerator for better damage with essentially the same cooldowns (still insanely low). Assuming it wasn't due to an external factor, once the melee combo starts, any art used immediately afterward signals the end of the combo (ranged: buff or aura or offensive art), they will also be affected by fast forward, since they denote the end of the melee combo. Hope this helped! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I completed post-game, farmed up a custom skell and a nice 700+ potential EBD before I decided to spend extensive time in O'rrh Sim Castle, so maybe, but even when I first found it, I was never aggroed by the waves of troops. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really? I NEVER get aggroed by any of the Ganglion inside, and I've explored the whole place a couple times over, the waves of Marnucks and Milsaadi would just brush right past me like I didn't exist, so I never had a chance to not hear the alarm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except O'rrh Sim Castle has the most god-awful alarm that goes off as soon as you set foot inside it, that is the one area of the game that I hate with a passion, its just so goddamn annoying, I don't understand how any non-deaf human being can deal with it without rupturing their own eardrums first (in case you can't tell I really don't like O'rrh Sim Castle). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably option one, getting a skell like the Vita or an Almandal (preferably Nardacyon's), sounds awesome and the Vita would be an excellent Ether glass cannon (at least I think it was ether), especially with the different Satellis, and Nardacyon's Almandal would be a super cool beam dodge-tank. Either way, option one introduces hella variability to end game, and would be a really cool addition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're nice fashion gear, second best imo, first is ultra infinite Orphean medium with six stars ultra boundless helm. But really, for what they cost to make, the bonuses just aren't good, and the only thing they're good for is resistance stacking since they're positive in all aspects  </TEXT>
