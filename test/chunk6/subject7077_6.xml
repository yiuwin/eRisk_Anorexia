	<TEXT> Okay...how does that prove Clinton murdered Seth Rich?
Assange confirmed that it was someone within the DNC that leaked the information.
How does that prove Clinton murdered Seth Rich? Just directly answer the question.

That is an uphill battle my friend. Or the:

An armed robbery where nothing was stolen?
Yeah, gonna have to go with assassination.

Couldn't you just....wait till the mother was done breastfeeding?

It didn't feel wrong in the slightest. It was beautiful to see her mother her child and not forget that she was my lover in the process.

Did seeing the baby not ruin it for you? Like...you're getting off...and there is just a baby there? 

On a side note and in OPs defense, I hate when AskReddit questions like that are asked and people just use them to judge and troll on answers. "Cheaters, why did you do it?" and the whole thread is just full of people ragging on those who are answering the question.  </TEXT>

After slavery was abolished, the white people in charge (for a lack of a better phrase) realized they could not just do what they wanted to black people anymore. The solution to this, through the law, was arresting them for minor reasons and locking them up. This of course expanded over time and as you said, The Drug War became a great resource for continued oppression- intentional and unintentional.

They're a wily bunch, as a serpent is to Adam - doesn't make them a fertile addition to the garden, does it?

Is this guy for real? 

It's a good thing. If you're a felon and you're looking for a job, this will at least help you get an interview. 

This is exactly the case. The complainers in this thread seem to be forgetting that our justice system is *supposed* (but largely fails) 
to reform criminals, not lock them up forever so we don't have to see them again. Of course I don't think it does that, but this is a step in the right direction to getting them out of the cycle that is the prison system.

	<TEXT> I was originally of the camp of "who cares" until I saw this:

Now I know that since you're just trolling from T_D here you might not know this, but hip-hop music is often political. Kanye has made very political songs and comments in the past. People often turn to music for the emotional effects it has, including during time of political tension. It's normal to criticize someone who you've agreed with on political issues. Just because you want everyone to shut up because you can't handle dissent and criticism, doesn't mean they're actually going to.

Which I felt presented a unique perspective on it that I hadn't considered. It's also nice seeing the pushback against the_dumpsterfire in there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, for the love of god, please show me how they are "oppressed" as the women being abused, raped, etc. in places like Saudi Arabia. Not trying to be rude but there's seriously nothing to complain about living a safe lifestyle in America.

These are the same people who think minorities are no longer oppressed since the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s. If women aren't being beaten on the streets then obviously everything is a-okay! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 3 run facts

1. We have most of the guns in the world.
 2. We produce most of the world's food.
3. Our debt is in US dollars, which we print.

And a fourth: The most diverse city in the world is Miami, fla. With every country in the world represented. Sorry Amsterdam, the city that lost all relevance once marijuana was legalized.

Trump supporter's beliefs never cease to amaze me (I assume he is a Trump supported based on context). What the fuck does having the most guns have to do with anything, let alone international political relations? 

And I love that he genuinely doesn't understand how debt works, but thinks he does. He probably thinks we can balance our US budget like a checkbook. Or maybe he even thinks running the government's economy is like running a business's finances.

On a side note, I know nothing about his second point. Could someone enlighten me on that? (Thank you /u/Aetol!)  </TEXT>

Except before the "go to bed" part I added in the following:

* Drunk text a bunch of women I never had a shot with while sober, let alone drunk.

* Cry

For maximum effect, after the "go to bed" part I like to also add:

* Wake up in the middle of the night, cry a little more.

* One more drink can't hurt, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  CIA concludes shit all the time with no real proof, to be fair.

 They concluded there were active WMDs in Iraq. I mean it was their report that Dubya was using as the primary justification.

Actually this isn't entirely true. Often times the CIA is put under pressure by lawmakers to lean a certain way in their reports. They'll say something like "Well there *could* be nukes but we don't think so" and a lawmaker who wants to invade or do whatever else will then only hear the first part. 

It's a super interesting dynamic.

/u/Oceloctopus made a similar [point](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5hxnq0/war_is_waged_in_rpolitics_over_whether_or_not_the/db3s2pd/) above. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit, I've got a tricky one here and hoping you can give me some advice on how to deal with the situation in the most delicate way possible.

So as the title says, a developmentally disabled girl in my daughters 4th grade class is bullying her and other students to a lesser extent. She seems focused on my daughter more than others though. She is non verbal(she shrieks but does not talk), has a full time aide assigned to her and is prone to outbursts. The aide catches most of the attempts at bullying, but for whatever reason, not all. The girl has destroyed items in my daughters lunch (latest incident was slamming her fist down on my daughters gogurt splattering it everywhere). She has put her mouth on my daughters   the other students water bottles, then flings the bottles to the floor. She has smashed my daughters pencil box and supplies tote on separate occasions. She is constantly disrupting class with shrieks and banging items. There is more, but you get the idea.

Perhaps bullying is the wrong word, I am aware that her disability is the reason for this behavior, but I am tired of my daughter taking the brunt of it and the aide being unable to prevent it. All my daughter gets is an apology from the aide "Oh she cant help it/Didn't mean it".

My heart goes out to the parent of the disabled child, but I don't want my daughter to burn just to keep the other child warm you know? I feel terrible saying this, but am I wrong in thinking that a child this disabled and disruptive should not be in the class? How should I approach this?

For posterity.  </TEXT>
