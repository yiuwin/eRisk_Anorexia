	<TEXT> Its very unfair to portray that whole scenario without at least giving the context that he was showing how desperate the site Fiver is, as people were willing to do such an insane variety of things for only 5 dollars. He also had tried giving similarly offensive or ridiculous tasks to others on the website (in the same video) to which they rightfully said no, so Felix fully expected the kids to reject his request as well. When he finds out that they actually did it, he is horrified and completely disavows it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Game Over, Man! is what it's called apparently, but I can see it being retitled. Not much has been revealed other than its supposed to be like comedy Die Hard in a hotel. It's written by all of them, directed by Kyle Newachek (Karl, directs the majority of Workaholics as well as other shows. Quite a good director) and starring the main trio.  </TEXT>

As for Smash 4, the Dlc characters aren't better so that complaint is invalid, plus I don't really get the complaint about having too much choice.

This is only because last year he unlocked the classroom doors for the pranking seniors, and they flipped a bunch of teachers desks like assholes. I tried to explain that through solidarity we could accomplish an at least harmless prank, but out of fear we did nothing instead. So lame.  </TEXT>

There is a huge difference in quality between say Arrested Development and The Big Bang Theory.

He shot this, The Night Before, This is the End, both Neighbors movies and Popstar: Never Stop Popping which are all very good looking comedies. The Night Before has some incredible scenes, and captured the Christmas look amazingly. He shot "The Disaster Artist" which comes out this year so I expect it to be quite visually interesting at the least.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After reading a couple of reviews and seeing it's 37 on Metacritic, I was happy with this movie after watching it. I laughed throughout, and enjoyed the entire movie. I would never say it's anywhere near perfect or even particularly great, but I was happy to have a nice short comedy that didn't take itself seriously unnecessarily. I was mainly just happy there wasn't any unneeded plots or big moral lessons shoved in. The fight scene was also fucking awesome, best comedy fight I've seen since the fight in Pineapple Express between Rogen, Franco, and McBride. All in all I'd give the movie probably a 7/10, which is honestly better than the majority of comedies I saw last year. 

What did everyone else think though? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is that Clooney is pretty experienced as a director at this point. He had 3 films before Monuments Men, with one being quite good (Confessions of a Dangerous Man) and one getting a Best Picture nom (Good Night, and Good Luck). Inexperience is not the reason for Monuments Men being such a let down.  Hopefully he learned from it for his upcoming Suburbicon, because with a Coen brothers script and that amazing cast I think it would be hard to mess it up. I feel more confident though since it will be his first film he directs without acting in.  </TEXT>
