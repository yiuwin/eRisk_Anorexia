	<TEXT> I left after my last class, 9:25, and got home at 6pm. It would have been cool to see it on Strava but my phone would have died with all snapchats I took and music I was bumping. I was at a cyclist party this last weekend and they were all of the attitude "if it isn't on strava, you didn't ride it bro". I am just not that religious about it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are so many! 

Steamworks for good american type food and good beer. The menu is seasonal

Carvers. Go for brunch and get the oatmeal stout or go any other time and get nachos.

I hear great thinks about Ska, but have yet to go.

Oscar's, Doughworks, and Durango Diner are all great places to get breakfast.

Zia's or Nini's for chipotle like food. I prefer Zia's personally. I think it tastes fresher.

Ken   Sues, Eolus, Chimaya for your pricier places

I don't like any of the pizza in town, but I'm from New York. A lot of people say homeslice but that is my LEAST favorite place. In order of my least favorite to favorite; Homeslice, Fired Up, JBos (out on Florida), and then DSP.

For greasy Chinese food, I like the Mongolian Grill and Maria's food truck. Maria is on the corner of College and 8th (across from the coop). She makes awesome food. It is pricey but she always gives me a bunch of food.

If you want Sushi or Japanese food in general this is my list from least favorite to favorite; East by Southwest, Rice Monkey, and Sushitarian. This is very contend among locals but I will always argue that sushitarian tastes is reminiscent of all the food I ate in Tokyo. Rice Monkey is better for Sushi, but Sushitarian's non-sushi items are way better in my opinion. 

That's all I can think of right now. I'm probably missing some places but this is a start.

	<TEXT> It really depends on what you are studying. As a Philosophy major, you do not need to read anything. You can sit through a class and try to make sense of the reading based on the discussion. You won't get everything out of the class but you'll still get an A. My grades are 90% composed of papers and 10% participation. Participation is just showing up most the time. It should be noted that the content for the papers can be extremely difficult, especially in upper division courses

	<TEXT> I would argue against posters. You can get cheap room decorations without appealing to posters. Everyone has posters, they aren't that interesting.

Go to a thrift store or a yard sale. I have found some really awesome Ansel Adam wood prints for sale while I was just walking down the street. I have a bunch of artwork from my friends and local artists hanging up. Tapestries are always cool. Prayer flags if you have any interest in buddhism. Get a flag of your home state, country, or providence.

Another nice touch is alternate lighting. The lights in dorm rooms are harsh. Get christmas lights or a lamp. Decent lighting makes all the difference.

If you haven't already, change up your room's layout. Maybe you should loft or bunk the beds. Get some feng shui going on in your room.

If you do go to the thrift store, maybe get some furniture. Extra chairs, a couch, or a chest. Check the free section of craigslist.

Hopefully this helps. This will be my third year in the dorms (this year as an RA). I never spent much time in my own room, but this is what I learned from other people's room. Honestly, posters are boring </TEXT>

Set aside some time in the morning to sit down, eat, and read the paper or watch tv. A bowl of cereal is easy and doesn't require cooking. Make a bagel, a bowl of muesli, or grab an egg and cheese sandwich at a local deli.

	<TEXT> It has been a while since I have read the meditations but I will try my best to clarify. The later books of his meditations jump around a lot and are broken, much like someone who has broken English. Premises or entire arguments are missing. This isn't bad because it's his journal, not a piece of academic philosophy. 

It is often uncogent because the few arguments in there are strong inductive argument that lack cogency. 

I don't think what I said is incoherent. I'm not going to study the meditations again and list my criticism on a popular subreddit. I just wanted to state my ostensible stance on Aurelius and Stoicism.

	<TEXT> I would say take it with a grain of salt. Stoicism has it's issues and a lot of what Aurelieus said is contradicted by his earlier writings or in conception. From a self-help point of view, his book is very good. From a philosophical or virtue ethics point of view, it is very broken, lacking evidence, and often uncogent. Meditations is just his journal. Aurelieus never wanted his work to be published </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Science never proves. Induction cannot prove anything because you cannot record or experience everything all the time. Part of the beauty of science is it's ability to change in light of new information. Science gives us good reason to believe certain things cause other things but science will never give us absolute certainty.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Love the accurate info drop.  Another thing about Hinsdale county. Hinsdale county stretches from Lake City down to William's Reservoir which can only be accessed from Pagosa. Though the reservoir is in Hinsdale, it can't be accessed from the only town in the whole county. The Weminuche covers most of Hinsdale. The Weminuche national forest is one the most remote places in the continental US. There are thousands and thousands if acres of valleys that don't have trails through them. The talk grass and wild flowers are so tall in the summer that you can only go through the valleys on a horse or
mule. No ATVs, mountain bikes, or hiker can get through there. Instead hikers have to hike the CDT or follow the ridges above tree line. 

I believe the weminuche is one of the most beautiful places in the world. I've traveled a lot but that national forest will always be a home to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Coloradans don't hate texans. They hate people from Texas, Oklahoma, California, New Mexico, or anywhere other than Colorado. They hate outsiders because the populate the unpopulated. It's kinda silly because 90% of texans do the same stuff. RVs, two mile hikes, shoot guns, drive atvs, and sometimes ride a bike. There is so much shit you can do to avoid texans like rock climbing, doing a real hike (you can hike for days before you see another person), backcountry skiing, downhill biking, xc biking, white water kayaking, or getting drunk, walking down main street of your favorite town, and messing with the texans.

The texan hatred is kinda silly and texans are very managable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Set and setting. There are people who shouldn't do psychedelics but far fewer than you think. If someone has a difficult trip, that doesn't mean they psychedelics. If someone has a difficult trip that probably means they have some underlying issues they need to address, whether it's anxiety, depression, guilt, or whatever difficulties. Psychedelics amplify everything and put it right in your face. It puts you in a better position to analyze the problem and solve it. 

There is not such a thing as a bad trip. There are difficult trips and they shouldn't be labeled as bad. Some of my most difficult trips have been the most helpful trips.  </TEXT>

It is also important to understand that VE is not an action based ethics, but many hold that virtue ethics inspires action based ethics. A virtue theorist would have to accept the arguments that say VE inspires action based ethics and  focus on the virtues that inspire that action.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To restate it in the second formulation of the categorical imperative; treat others as ends in themselves and not mere means. As long as you aren't helping others purely for your own sake you're fine.

A utilitarian would say that we ought to produce happiness (not to be read as pleasure).

You could also go on to debate the possibility of true altruism, but I'm not as familiar with that dialogue. 

Virtue ethics could lead you to many different views on the topic. That's something I don't want to attempt to draw out. 


It's important to understand that there will not be a clear answer to this case but it is important to understand the different views.

	<TEXT> There are a lot of arguments that defend vegetarianism. Singer argument is probably the most popular.
1. The only criterion of moral importance that succeeds in including all humans, and excluding all non-humans, is simple membership in the species Homo sapiens.
2. However, using simple membership in the species Homo sapiens as a criterion of moral importance is completely arbitrary.
3. Of the remaining criteria we might consider, only sentiencethe capacity of a being to experience things like pleasure and painis a plausible criterion of moral importance.
4. Using sentience as a criterion of moral importance entails that we extend to other sentient creatures the same basic moral consideration (i.e. "basic principle of equality") that we extend to (typical, sentient) human beings.
5. Therefore, we ought to extend to animals the same equality of consideration that we extend to human beings.

Though he never states it, Singer's argument is utilitarian. From a utilitarian stand point it would make sense to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet because it has less of an impact on the environment and will slow rain forest deforestation. 

Tom Regan gives a deontological argument for animal rights. He argues that non-human animals are what he calls the "subjects-of-a-life", just as humans are, and that, if we want to ascribe value to all human beings regardless of their ability to be rational agents, then to be consistent, we must similarly ascribe it to non-humans.

Buddhists refrain from killing animals because the highest and most universal ideal of Buddhism is to work unceasingly for permanent end to the suffering of all living beings, not just humans.

There are a lot of different views on animal rights and abstaining from eating meat. I would argue that arguments for not eating meat are easier to defend than arguments for animal rights. There is a lot of debate over meat eating but there is no harm done in abstaining from meat consumption. From a utility calculus it is more obvious that eating meat could cause suffering and not eating meat is much less likely to cause suffering. In fact abstaining from eating meat probably causes more happiness from an anthropocentric or a ecocentric position. The only argument for eating meat I believe is strong is a hedonist argument. Eating meat brings me pleasure and pleasure is the only intrinsic good </TEXT>

I wanted to keep restricting because it made me comfortable but I knew I couldn't keep going. I graduated high school early and moved away from my mom, what I believed to be the cause of my eating disorder and depression. I moved across the country to live with my dad. Both my parents said that I would have to seek treatment before moving in. I agreed, graduated high school half way through my senior year and was on a plane the next week.

	<TEXT> In philosophy, logic is used in developing arguments for a certain ethical view. Most people who use ethics or morals do not refer to the methodology of ethics in philosophy. For the sake of consistency, logic should refer to morality.

by the way, morality is a lot more complicated than just 'logic'
The inverse would be more true (logic is more complicated than just morality), but to say that we would have to affirm the consequent. Morals should be grounded in logic and applied with logic, as a means of keeping ourselves from over extending morals to a point of incoherence or irrelevance.

Berkeley believes god is the universal mind controlling our inability to perceive the difference between primary and secondary perceptions. Hume does not.
