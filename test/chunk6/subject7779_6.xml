	<TEXT> I'm not too sure also but I think it also has to do with Verified Accounts. Lets all admit it, we had throwaway reddit accounts and I know unverified accounts has a time limit before posting/replying again.

EDIT: Fine, not most of us did not made a throwaway account. I hear you /r/Philippines

	<TEXT> Well when you open an account, you'll see a verified account. Also I think the amount of post and comment upvotes plus the "Member since X years" is enough.

Thats why it is better to check their account first. If you see the Upvotes and Downvotes plus the "Member since X days." it is possible that it is them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My fandom to wrestling is alive again starting from the recent WWE Brand Split. It was a great decision that they did that. RAW and Smackdown is competing each other but their in the same company which is WWE.

Then I got more curious. I watched Impact Wrestling, TNA. I want to understand WWE's direct competitor. And I found out TNA is in a whole different level compared to WWE. TNA is aimed to more adult demographic compared to WWE's PG demographic. I actually like both WWE and TNA. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention WWE's NXT too! I wish to see Samoa Joe to either RAW and Smackdown! </TEXT>

I also remember the very first Daily Random Discussion. Wala pang Nightly Random Discussion noon. Late na na-implement.  </TEXT>

Not everyone shares his point of view. Out of 100% of voters, [39% voted him](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36253612), which means a total of 61% from other Presidential candidates of voters did not vote him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a Filipino Redditor from the Philippines and I do not like this at all. He does not represent everyone here. I did not vote him. Only 39% out of 100% of the people did vote him. ~~60%~~ 61% did not! As I know there are people now that regret voted him. HE EVEN SAID IN HIS CAMPAIGN THAT DO NOT VOTE HIM. Redditors in /r/Philippines makes fun of his remarks since the campaign period.

BTW, there are die hard supporters here who worship him and people here are calling them DUTERTARDS. They defend him in an instant and Cyber Bully the people who criticize Duterte.

EDIT: Miscalculated out of frustration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting. I have a schedule with my doctor within the coming week. I will tell him about my issue with uric acid. I really thought banana would help because I also need potassium. So drinking lots of water will be a great help then. Thanks for the info!

	<TEXT> I got my blood test exam results and I'm unsatisfied with my Uric Acid level. It is not that high yet but I do feel pain on my feet whenever I walk especially the very first step whenever I wake up.

Before I consult to my doctor within the coming week, are there any foods that I need to avoid with high Uric Acid and are there foods that help lower Uric Acid? I do regularly drink water since I know it does help lower it but I think there is something that I can do to help lower it more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now, I'm into Diablo III, Street Fighter V, Super Smash Bros. 4 WiiU/3DS, Pokemon Omega Ruby, and sometimes online Mario Kart 8 races. I also have Tales of Zestiria but I haven't started yet and want to play King of Fighters XIV. As I know the Philippine Fighting Game Community has weeklies but I am unable to go due to work. :(

I finished Star Ocean 5 and lend it to my friend. I'm now waiting for Final Fantasy XV, Pokemon Sun/Moon, Tales of Berseria, Tekken 7: Fated Retribution and maybe Kingdom Hearts 2.8 but will buy Kingdom Hearts 3 in day one! </TEXT>

He and PBE|Bully are very approachable. Both of them are from Cebu City BTW.  </TEXT>

Of course ibang iba ang Philippine Smash community compared sa US Smash Community with all the "special treatment" and floating in tournaments. I know SmashPH is not like that.

I know some people who plays Smash4 competitively in SmashPH who are also fans and play SF, MvC, Tekken, MK, Guilty Gear, Blazeblue and even KoF. Though just a handful that I know who plays but plenty are fans of the FGC.  </TEXT>

Shout out to Imperium Pro Team who TOed this event and xSplit Philippines who handled the broadcasting! I think they had plenty of learning experience from this event since it is the second Manila Cup. Hopefully next year will be bigger and better. Overall the event was a complete success! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is hosted by Philippines' own Imperium Pro Team with big sponsors such as **Sony**, Globe, Grab, View Sonic, and xSplit. This is the 2nd Manila Cup that Capcom themselves gave the go signal to Imperium Pro Tour Team for the official Capcom Pro Tour in the Capcom Pro Tour series.

Also, the Philippine FGC is alive for many years now. Its just that the scene is now coming out with a big exposure like this.

FGC Weeklies are around the metro such as in PlayBook Pergola Alabang, PlayBook Circuit Makati, Cosmic Gorgons Cubao Expo, and PlayPad Mandaluyong. Hopefully Secret Base in East Manila and Game Over Xavierville will start building their FGC scene.

EDIT: Forgot to add **Sony** who is one of the major sponsors! ~~They sponsored the PS3s for Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 and PS4s for Street Fighter V, Mortal Kombat XL, BlazeBlue, and Guilty Gear!~~

EDIT 2: I was mistaken </TEXT>
