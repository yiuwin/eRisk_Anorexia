	<TEXT> I used to hide in this one room at the airport to fight cops and survive my bounties from players. (Yes, it was a simpler time.)

I remember a player brought a Rhino to the airport to get me but there was no way he wild be able to get me from inside this safe haven... so I thought... 

Sure enough his blasts got me through the wall. That's just GTA physics.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't anything new so please don't hate on this post. I just want to share. 

I basically start my Crystal Clear Out III playlist, plug in my controller, rubber band it so it doesn't time out, then go watch the game. 

I come back 15+ minutes later and finish the mission. This nets me $40,800. I do this five times in a row in between commercial breaks or pause the Warriors game and go back to GTA. 

After casual, semi-AFK, watching basketball, I walk away with $200k! How cool is that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's nothing to fix. It's not broken. 

You're supposed to be doing work in an hostile environment. Your only real "fix" is to have associates, friends, crew mates to help and defend you. 

That's the whole point of all of Rockstar's recent DLCs ... it's to get players to work together and interact. They know that multiplayer and player interaction has more legs than single-player story modes and no player interaction. 

I feel bad for you and I don't understand people that fuck with other people's shit, either. But this isn't a broken system. It's designed to be like this.  </TEXT>

Of course, if the guy just thinks dragging everything out as long as possible is the best way to go, he's wrong. But going a bit long isn't always bullshit. :) </TEXT>

It's soooOoo easy and solo, pays $20,400 in 4-minutes. That $300,000 in an hour. That's silly money.

	<TEXT> To give you an estimate, source a car and sell a car (that's two missions) for $80,000 net. 

You'll need to do this almost 90 times to make $7,000,000. 

If it takes you 6-12 minutes per mission (two missions per car -- one source, one deliver,) that's 18-36 hours of gameplay. If you can get like 4-hours in a day, you can get $7M in one to two weeks.

	<TEXT> People don't like MC in comparison to CEO because CEO makes more money with smaller initial investment. 

But the MC stuff is super fun to me. And, if you do it right, it's more money than CEO work after you've gone black on the balance sheet. 

Ideally you just do CEO work and MC work together and balance your time between Blaine County and the city and you're having a great time. 

I say buy the MC. DoD will still be there and you can earn enough to buy it with just a couple of coke shipments. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only transfer of progress (that I know of) was from GTAV:O previous gen (Xbox, PS3) to new gen (XB1, PS4, PC)

Rockstar allowed you to bring in old characters and progress. They've also been rewarding players who bought the game on past and new gen machines by offering discounts, exclusive, and free items on in-game purchases and new dlc items.

They have since cut off transfers between consoles. I believe March 6 was the last day. Don't quote me on that. 

So who knows what will happen for GTA6? 

Could be a brand new type of game that takes place on a moon colony and it wouldn't make sense to transfer our current characters. :-D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yesterday I delivered a full coke shipment and a full weed shipment after having recruited a friend to help -- turned out the coke was one delivery truck with three waves of motorcycle bad guys and I only had to go like 2 miles. Super easy. Could have soloed it. 

The weed shipment was a bag I carried (and my MC Road captain had one too, but I imagine it would have only been one bag if I soloed it) and had to deliver about 2 miles. I had a chopper with me so it took like 60 seconds. 

Easy shipments can happen! Don't lose hope!

(To be fair, my meth shipment was three PostOp trucks. I turned off the game to load in a different shipment method. I've yet to go back and see...) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never jumped on that "the AI is OP headshotting me from a million miles away!" bandwagon because these I/O missions were designed to be played in lobbies with PvP dynamics in mind. 

If you're lagging out of a server to play by yourself, it's fair that the AI gets a little bit of a accuracy boost.

	<TEXT> One time I was in a lobby and these guys (with mics) were teaming up against me 3-on-one for the better part of an hour. I eventually ran off to Blaine County before they finally left me alone. 

Shortly thereafter, there was an invite alert to do prison heist. I joined them and for some reason they thought it a good idea to invite someone they had just been fucking with for an hour. 

Anyway we drive to the prison and I have the job of flying the getaway plane. We're about to finish and I blow up the plane on "accident"

We restart and I make the same "mistake."

I do this two more times but they kept restarting. Eventually it got to the point where they were too stubborn to kick me and let me win and I was too stubborn to quit out of boredom. 

Finally I got booted from my internet connection. I thought they DDOSed me. But it's more likely my modem just crapped out. 

This is not typical, of course, for people acting "mentally challenged," but it's one reason out of a million.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * Office garages look amazing.

* being able to mod your car with the built-in mod shop is amazing.

* you can also do Benny's mods without leaving your garage, which is amazing.

* consolidating two ten-car garages into one spot is amazing.

* I have the 60-car garage so having three floors of showroom-quality cars all in one place is amazing.

* having the extra 10-car garages scattered throughout the city (assuming you didn't trade them in) available as hideouts and for storing Sandkings, Dubsta 2s, or gang Mananas is a very welcomed utility and that's amazing too.

These are just my reasons. I'm sure other people might not care for it, which is fine. To each their own. Amazing.

	<TEXT> There was one mission where I had to get a van out of the impound at Vespucci PD HQ (the one with the big gates and usually has an armored police truck spawn inside it, also spawns Rhino from Pegasus)

I used sneak to walk into the gates and literally walked right past a cop standing near the gate all the way until I was about 10 feet away from the van I was supposed to steal. Then the stars came and they started shooting at me. 

I used stealth as a joke and I'm not sure if it would have made a difference if I didn't or if it was just a glitch or whatever, but that was pretty amusing. 

If nothing else, it's a placebo I'll probably start using from now on.  </TEXT>

There's not a mission I can't do without a cargobob, the biggest hassle being the one where the amateur thief takes off in the car I want. For those I usually snipe him from afar before he gets a chance to drive away, but in about 50/50 on triggering his escape. 

Outside of that mission, I do 95% of the cars at 100% damage-free for sourcing and delivering. So I suppose if someone crunched the numbers, the cargobob will pay for itself in repair costs before long.

But I'll concede it's not for everyone. It can get boring doing it this way and does take a gentle touch.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally I think it's quite fun. If you have friends to join your MC Club, all the more so. Plus, the MC president ability to instantly call any motorbike and dismiss (magically send back your personal vehicle-- any vehicle) is super handy. You can literally switch to MC, do what you need to, and switch back to doing whatever you were doing (provided you're not already in a CEO mission or other contact mission)

Just this ability makes it kinda worth it. But I suppose that all depends on what cash you have on hand </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I semi-recently bought into businesses (coke, then meth, and JUST TWO DAYS AGO, weed) and find it a lot of fun. 

It's good money if you treat it as a side gig and not the primary grind. So I think if you own one you should just use it. 

But to your point, if you don't use it, apparently you can fully stock up on supplies with a few supply missions and then shut it down. That way, LJT doesn't call anymore. that's what I heard anyway </TEXT>

	<TEXT> R* nerfed the ability to create repeat playlists. Probably right around the time GTA came to PC. So there's probably no way to find any old repeat playlists that are grandfathered in. Oh well. 

It could still be worth doing the single playlist and hitting "replay" afterwards rather than reloading the mission manually  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prior to the latest DLCs, the Dewbauchee Exemplar was the fastest sedan. 

I love the way it looks, drives, and sounds. It's only downside is that it doesn't have many (any?) cosmetic mods, but it's still a great mission car and looks amazing all blacked out with limo tint windows and custom wheels. 

Plus, no one else drives one so that's always cool.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This can be done solo with a Buzzard in 20 minutes and 30 seconds without even trying hard. Including lobby screens!

You make $10k+ each time if you do it average speed. Too fast and you'll lose a bit of payout.

It's also good practice for VIP Headhunter work. (Or maybe Headhunter was good practice for this)

Edit: it's more like $20k each time for closer to $100,000 in 20-25 minutes.  </TEXT>

That amount of money is easily earned in a couple of weeks of normal playing. I'm not disputing that. 

Try thinking logically, you fucking white knight. He can have earned money legitimately but that doesn't mean he didn't also mod. Have you looked at the one thread where he's caught in a lie? He's obviously part of the modding community. 

Think for yourself once in a while and try not to get caught up in brigading like a teenager. Just go look at the facts.  </TEXT>
