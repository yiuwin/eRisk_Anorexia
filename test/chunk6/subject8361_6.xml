	<TEXT> Oops you're right! It's Curls Goddess hair gel. It's very light hold (in my opinion), but it leaves curls very soft and touchable which is more important to me. When it runs out I don't think I'll repurchase the though. I will try a stronger hold gel and "scrunch out the crunch" as a lot of commenter have suggested :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The spray in the morning does refresh the curls, yes. I lose the after-plop level of curl as the day goes on too, especially in humidity. A stronger hold gel or moouse might do the trick but I am hesitant because crunchy hair doesn't suit me. If you figure it out let me know!! </TEXT>
