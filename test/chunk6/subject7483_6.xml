	<TEXT> I love history and always have, but people always say, "How do you love that? It is always so boring! I hated it in school!" Now I love history because of how it is both the story of individual people and the whole of humanity. You get the horrors of a single soldier lost in a hopeless war but also you see how countries and customs today came to be. I find it the ultimate story, the longest, most creative, most insane story ever told.  </TEXT>
