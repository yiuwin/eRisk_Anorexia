	<TEXT> I have aspegers and have 2 kids with autism and 1 with aspergers.

I've felt like everything I do is an act.  I had little to no treatment and was diagnosed later in life.  I had to learn how to act from watching other people.  

Small talk is still hard for me but it was impossible when I was younger.  I can't look into people's eyes easily, though I found a technique where I move my focus close to their eyes but not directly has helped.  Crowds bother the heck out of me, but I've found different ways to center myself so I don't get overwhelmed.

I've learned to show emotion more, especially with my kids.  As I much as I have taught them to cope, they have returned tenfold on how I can express my emotions.

I've made sure that they know being on the spectrum isn't a curse or disease, it's just a part of who they are and needs to be accepted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals." 

- C.S. Lewis

I think the majority of Democrats think this way.  If only the government was large enough and powerful enough to help solve everyone's issues.  You end with burecratic nightmares like Obamacare because they do it for the "good" of the people.  Doesn't work after implementing it?  Must need more government then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe instead of bashing Christians, realize we are an ally?  Most Christians that will support Trump don't support him because he's a Christian.  We support him because we best believe he will support us.

I understand your frustration with the "Religious Right".  So many Christians used their power to thump people with their bibles instead of truly spreading a message of love and acceptance.  

I personally hope that the "culture change" that happens has a foundation of some Christian values but is inclusive of all people.

Guy waited in line at a Taco Bell with a knife hidden under his clothes.  He gets to front and yells loudly at the cashier, "Give me all your money!"

The robber then hears sounds of guns coming out of holsters and multiple people yelling, "Put the knife down now!"

The robber somehow missed the fact that a conference for the top Sheriffs was being held across the street, and most were in full uniform enjoying their lunch break. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is exactly what I thought when I watched the video of her speech.  She actually had some great parts, and I do like her as an actress.  

She could have either:

A) ignored politics completely (Best)

B) mention politics but call for unity (Better)

But instead she decided to do the worst option:

C) mention politics and insult a large part of America with the football and MMA comment. (SAD!)

Piers was right, you could see that bubble on display last night.  They are still so sure they represent the heart and soul of America.  They just don't see how out of touch they are with the everyday American. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate that they tied renewables to climate change.  I don't trust climate change completely when governments tell me they need a large slush fund to "fight climate change".

I do trust renewables.  We need more and more energy to evolve further as a society.  Finding a renewable energy that allows for little to no pollution and is cost efficient would be huge.  I'm excited for advances  with solar as that could help 3rd world countries near the equator to become more developed.

I'm glad Musk is partnering with President Trump.  Musk especially had been crucial in trying to bring renewable energy to the masses using innovation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I went to college for computer science, there was only one woman in a class of 30.  It's not sexist, the numbers just aren't there for that field.

But there are more women in college than men.  Does that mean attending college is inherently sexist towards men?  Or course not, men are just less likely to go to college.

Btw, 3 out of the last 5 managers have been women.   Women are present in technology but maybe not as much in the engineering side. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> When President Obama mentions winning let's compare him to President Bush </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-28 10:24:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The following numbers compare seats lost for Obama vs Bush during their presidency.

**House of Representatives**

* Bush 43

* Obama 63

**Senate**

* Bush 9

* Obama 11

**Governors**

* Bush 8

* Obama 13

**Control of State Legislature**

* Bush 4

* Obama 15


President Obama lost more seats in every level of government than President Bush.  He may have won two elections, but he devastated his party while accomplishing his goal.

	<TEXT> I'm an autistic parent, possibly have aspergers myself but it's self diagnosed.

So when I get asked about it the first thing I usually mention is that it's a spectrum.  Then I usually follow up how each person on the spectrum can have different traits/conditions associated with autism so it can't be easily defined.

I have three kids with autism, and I would need to define each of them separately because they each exhibit different traits. </TEXT>
