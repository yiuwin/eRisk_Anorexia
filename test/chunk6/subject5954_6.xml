	<TEXT> [Tom Day - Lorn](https://soundcloud.com/tomday/tom-day-lorn), opened the Ambient door for me. Will never forget the first time I heard it while looking at the stars.

[Slowing Inertia - Farewell](https://soundcloud.com/slowingnertia/farewell), Post-rock. The unexpected climax hits ... .

[RUDE - Eternal Youth](https://rudemn.bandcamp.com/track/eternal-youth) Taught me that there is music that expresses certain Anime vibes. Got me to discover the youtube channel [AnimeVibe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9uLMAmdGQaeLPHAOqkYlrw), a few words aren't enough for the channel too.

Misread the title for "songs" instead of song. Whoops, well here you go! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I had the same problem with an opponent, his snake model had to make a decision and just didn't wanna talk. The problem was that its talking wasn't clear to us, we searched for the snake alphabet and try sssshh ppsshhh ssh-en but even after the effort we couldn't understand. We sat it in front of a bright light, threatened to boil him but he wouldn't budge. In the end we obviously called Harry Potter which took some days but got us the answer </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry for the late answer! I was playing Warrior and on my turn I drew  Sea Reaver (Epic Warrior class card), as soon as I saw the card it went into my opponent's hand and it's effect resolved there. (Dealing 1 damage to all of his minions)

I believe I was playing against a Priest. </TEXT>
