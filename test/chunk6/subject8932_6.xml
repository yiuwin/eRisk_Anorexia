	<TITLE> Using the PX5 on the PS4 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-12 15:39:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I used to use the PX5 on the PS3 and it was awesome...
I connected it to the PS4 a couple days back and the quality was so so bad... the noise was sort of fuzzing in and out of clearness, so I just stopped using it.

Is there any way I can use the PX5 on my PS4? Especially with perks like Awareness being so important and giving such a major boost/advantage.

I know there is some cable I have to buy, I'm form the UK - Can anybody help me out at all?

Thank you all </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't mind going high risk. If I lose it all it'll make no difference to my life.

I'm tempted to purchase shares in an up and coming soccer team, whether that's in China, India or America... It's constantly growing and looking into the distant future I think the MLS/China has the potential to be huge.

Any advice is welcome, cheers all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol is this a serious question?

Prime TH is as deadly as anyone.

39 Goals and 19 assists in a season.

Suarez had 31 goals and 14 assists (and also the luxury of playing only once per week)

	<TEXT> Decided to use it properly last night. Domination, first time using it, and BOOM... I was slicing and dicing opponents for fun.

When you hit R1/L1, the knife just automatically goes for the throat, even if the enemy is slightly to my left or right. I got 3 kills in a row LOADS of times. How is not everybody using this? 

My new fav thing, 100% keeping this for the long term. Forget the Gravity Spikes.

Oh, and it loads in like 2 minutes, so in a game of domination you can use it about 5 times. Proper sick, would recommend.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [TOMT] Name of a movie help please </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I remember when I a youngster I watched a clip of a movie, but my dad (being the boss of the house) turned it over to whatever he wanted to watch.

The only thing I remember is this caveman was trapped in what looked like the jungle, but you had scientists watching him through glass. There was trees and water and all sorts, and the caveman (or even just a normal dirty man) was trying to get out, he was running and jumping and he knew he wasn't in his normal surrounds.

I'm sorry but that's all I have. It was as if the normal humans were looking at an animal in a cage (although it wasn't a cage) </TEXT>
