	<TEXT> ughh, fucking life, right?!? 

I crawl out of my cave to try and make friends. Meet a really awesome and cute boy.  
Him: "Hey, I really like you"  (and stuff)  
Me: *giggle* "I really like you too!" (and other stuff)  
Him: I think I like you too much.. I'm getting kind of attached though.. like boyfriends attached"  
Me: *Really confused look indicating I have no idea why that could be a bad thing*  
Him: "I'm moving in three weeks and I don't really want to hang out anymore so I don't break my heart more when I move.. we can still text and stuff though..." 

FML. I'm going back into my cave with my books, my music, and my video games. *Adios!* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mens Rights Activism? Backlash to losing male privilege, so it become a circle-jerk of misogyny and patriarchy grossness. 

I tend to think of Feminism a lot more academic and theory based rather than what I'm pretty sure people are calling "Feminism". People like Donna Haraway, Judith Butler, and other authors (generally) from the Frankfurt School of theory. Has a lot of inter-connectivity with Queer, Race, and Ecological studies. There are very rarely only "feminist" authors anymore.

	<TEXT> Bipolar 2, Generalized anxiety, anorexia, NLD ("Nonverbal learning Verbal Disorder" makes some social and learning difficult).

Fairly volatile emotions leaning towards depressive, when I'm stressed out I can become hypomanic and quite irrational because my *feels* are all out of whack (Bipolar 2).  
I make a lot of connections about everything all the time. I'm constantly  up in my own mind thinking instead of being 100% engaged with the outside world (Anxiety).  
Serious control issues, extreme empathy towards animals (vegetarian-almost vegan), hunger helps keep my brain from going a billion miles a minute when I'm stressed. (Anorexia)  
Super hardcore right brained. My left brain is pathetic and is pretty useless. (NLD)

All of my mental illness problems probably have some root into my personality it seems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have very strong opinions about all of those things. I feel like those are inequalities that can be really oppressive and it makes me sad that those persist and actively hurt people. I grew up gay in small town Texas with the only ally I had was critical literature (i.e. Zizek, Foucault, Butler, etc..) so now I've definitely latched onto it as a way of thinking. I'm *constantly* critiquing the world around me and I see the same oppression all around me that I felt growing up and I want to try to stop as much of it I can.

I agree on the second part. I can become pretty negative sometimes, but when someone else starts being negative I can't stand it. It's hypocritical and I'm working on not being negative as much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keep your head up and stay strong! I'm rooting for you! Never give up on yourself! I'm not religious but I firmly believe that everyone has a unique purpose in life, and it's a terribly sad thing when someone denies themselves of their potential. 

Happy thoughts and good internet vibes and stuff!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Woah. This is crazy.

* I've never been *scared* of people or social interactions, but found that I couldn't always keep up because there was so much going on that it overwhelmed me until I figured some social out.  
* I'm actually pretty tone deaf but I've always been able to pick up on people's change in inflection that was very indicative of their emotions. Also lots of sounds and visual stimulus has a tendency to make me pretty anxious.  
* Don't even want to talk about falling head over heels in love. Not even going there.  
* Social justice is what I'm most passionate about, I'm always fighting for the underdog and under-privileged.. I think that sometimes I'm almost empathetic to a fault.  
* I'm not artistic but I'm intellectually creative and it's hard to sometimes think or speak in a linear fashion because my thought process is so abstract. 

I'd be willing to bet a good portion of INFP are probably to some degree "HSP" as well. Crazy stuff!

	<TEXT> Awwww Yissss! Got my first Reddit gold AND silver. This post pretty much made life's accomplishments pale in comparison. It's strange how much importance I've learned to attach to fairly arbitrary things.. Reddit is to blame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *1.) How is your own level of self-awareness at this point?*  
I tend to have fairly frequent mini-existential-crisis' when I come across something that makes me think. I'm trying to constantly reevaluate where I stand and what I believe. Lots of people interpret this as I'm not self-aware, but I see it as nearly being hyper self aware. I know my identity and what I want, but I'm also aware that I'm constantly evolving and changing.

*2.) Do you have a good idea how other people perceive you?*  
Yes and no.. I tend to be really self conscious and have low confidence levels around people I'm not comfortable with. I know where I stand with people that I'm close to though. I think this comes from me being pretty critical of myself paired with my constant reevaluation of nuances of my identity. I've been accused of being narcissistic and thinking that I'm better than everyone else, so I tend to suppress a lot of my personality around people that don't know me well -- which results in people thinking that I'm pretty dull and always very reserved.

*3.) Do you feel separated from everything that's not you?*  
Depends on what you mean -- People's emotions and motivations I feel pretty connected to; understanding why those exist I'm at a loss sometimes. Like, why the fuck would someone staunchly support nationalistic military when it only hurts lots of people? How do they not see that what they are doing is so destructive and oppressive? But at the same time I understand (what I consider bloodlust) to come from a sense of pride and duty that I simply don't have or understand.

*4.) Do you find that meditation helps your self-awareness?*  
Never really taken the time to actually meditate. My brain runs at a million miles a minute constantly seeing connections and thinking about critical literature and it's relation to pragmatic solutions. I need to take time and meditate -- it'd be nice to learn how to shut my brain off from all of that without having to get fucked up.

*5.) Do you think that the general public who act unhealthily with their surroundings are all at similar levels of self-awareness?*  
This is a hard question to answer because self-awareness is always a grey area that I can't judge for other people. Refer to my answer in question to #3 where I explain an instance of that. Generally I think that people in westernized culture (all I have experience with) tends to be very superficial without much internal evaluation. For instance, I believe EVERYTHING that we do is political and have unspoken assumptions that are intrinsic in being human, but it seems that most people refuse to critically analyze their actions and the extended implications in what they say, do, dress, etc.. -- essentially people are too self absorbed in themselves and their naivety to look at how stuff effects (affects?) other people/animals/environment.

*BONUS!!! Do you sometimes see yourself in the mirror and feel startled that that is you in the reflection?*  
Doesn't seem like very many people are experiencing this.. I honestly wasn't aware that other people experience this dysphoria. My internal dialogue when I examine myself (mostly my face) is "Is this really what I look like? Is this presentation an accurate descriptor of my identity? This is fucking weird... " However, I'm nearly 20 but I look 15 or 16 so that definitely plays into it (I look young, but I don't *feel* the way I look, if that makes sense). I'm also hyper aware with my balance of feminine/masculine presentation, so there's that. But all in all, ya, I get what you're saying and when I'm on drugs those feelings are in hyper-drive.  
Weed, meh. Psychadelics, "omg what is this fleshy robot thing around my soul?!" Dissacoiatives "Is this my body.. whaaaat.... my skin is weird." </TEXT>
