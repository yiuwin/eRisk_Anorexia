	<TEXT> im looking through my background systems that are running now, noting that without titanfall or any game even running 96% of my memory is  being used, even after cancelling some programs the main culprit seems to be "antimalware service executable" that is using anywhere between 20-30mb of memory and i have no idea if im ok to shut that down or get rid of it </TEXT>

	<TITLE> titanfall is one of the best fps singleplayer campaigns since the early halo's imo </TITLE>

	<TEXT> This games single player campaign was way better than any expectation i could have possibly had, the way they implement all of the different aspects and features of the game into the campaign instead of it just being, room full of enemies to kill rinse repeat, really helps that the  character development between bt and jack seemed really plausible and realistic, 9/10 imo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah, it sucks though that companies only let you play a training rig in most games just so they can say their games are "playable before fully downloaded" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> nope you can use it whenever you want, first year you have it you also get 10% off food and drink and 10% of some other restaurants like frankie and bennies, second year it is 25% discount, you also dont have to pay for upgrade to 3D and an Imax ticket is only 6.30 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i pay 16.90 a month for a unlimited movies card at a certain cinema chain, how do movie studio's make money off of my monthly subscription? will the cinema chain just see what movies i see then send a % of the cost of the card to that studio each month? I often see about 2-3 movies a month so it ends up paying for its self i just often wonder how that money gets distributed towards the different studio's </TEXT>
