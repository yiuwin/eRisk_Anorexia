	<TEXT> I caught the GIF via Hoverzoom and thought it was Cities Skylines at first and got excited when I saw the cool, realistic road texture and then more intrigued about the emerging center turn lanes..and then realllly surprised at the shooting. I was thinking I was really behind on the latest mods than I would've believed.  </TEXT>

The way you put it was spot on, it's so close to what I want it to be that it's extra frustrating or disappointing. But I'm sure there are tons of people out there that thought that early on and then it morphed into what it's become and then they thought, "And now it's EXACTLY what I want", so great news for them, it just can't please everyone all the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got so bored and disappointed around the episode ~50 mark when it became so focused on Cecil and Carlos and ceased to feel like an actual radio show. I never wanted Cecil to become a fully fleshed person that the show revolved around, I liked him feeling distant and impersonal, a reporter...ya know like a real radio broadcaster feels like. When they got big and famous, I didn't want to have a guest star come in and realize pretty much every side character mentioned more than once. 

I'd like to catch up, it will probably go down easier when I can listen to several episodes back to back and quickly get past the lame parts. But I think the charm might have worn off for me. And with the books and thousands of live shows and a substantial Tumblr fanbase to squeal and cheer them on, I think it's a Pandora's box and it's never going to be the show I used to love. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a bit turned off by the ending at first but loved it after a day or two of thinking about it. It's a wonderful, fairly cynical end that's perfect for Mad Men and Don's character. At this point, for me, Dick Whitman is gone, there's only Don Draper. And Don Draper is a walking, talking advertisement. Defining an advertisement as an inviting, carefully constructed presentation of certain ideas. This was a long-winded way of saying that Don is advertising, he can't escape it. He has money and could do anything else, but he couldn't. He tested that as much as one could...drive cross country and completely remove yourself from your former life. And still, advertising bubbled up inside him and took control again. 

My only quibble is I wish there could've been a way to get the Coke ad across without literally showing it exactly as if it was a legitimate commercial. That took me out of the show a bit. Maybe have it show on a TV in their world, or even just have the song start to play over the final scene as Don started to grin.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's no direct evidence in the movie of a connection, but the things you state don't disprove it either. Maybe the monster in Manhattan was killed in the explosion that ended the film and no other monsters came out of the ocean. The world would move on. We don't have a big monster attack for precedence exactly, but the world moved on after September 11th and not every movie was expected to mention it lest we think it's some kind of alternate history. I don't think it's unreasonable that if the monster was killed the day it emerged or shortly after that the iPhone would continue to evolve on roughly the same trajectory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it's very likely that any attempt at an explanation would be unsatisfying/underwhelming/silly...It's just that pesky human curiosity that's always nagging at me. Even though I remember feeling a bit perturbed by the unanswered questions ten years ago, on my reread I thought all the characters being in the dark was for the best and added to the horror of the situation. And I liked that it was one if the few King novels that isn't building towards a confrontation. I mean, I suppose it did a little...But not in the sense of trying to defeat this antagonistic faction as a whole, jeez, how would you? It was a good King-ish approach to a zombie story, still his own but it respected their "rules" and honored their typical atmosphere. </TEXT>

It's like a myopic, micro-The Stand, there's a whole world of parallel storylines that could be explored and, while it could certainly always end up ruining things, digging into the origin of the pulse and how things played out after the time of Clay's story ended.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're gonna be a collector, yeah, the limited availability of physical cartridges justifies high prices, but once we're talking about digital distribution it's ridiculous. Outside of limited physical stock, the price of basically everything in the world deprecates over the years. It's not a bottle of wine, it's a decades old "dead" game that you've been able to play perfectly emulated for years. GoG.com and Steam and the dozen other pc game stores understand it...And nevermind just talking about older games, you could get plenty of major release games on their drop date or within the first few months for less than $20. 

But, all that said, they wouldn't price things exorbitantly if people weren't buying. Just having an official release is apparently important enough for enough people that Nintendo has decided to sick to their pricing standards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is spot on. I've talked with a friend who is also a big Ghostbusters nut and we discussed how as young kids the movie worked completely well being viewed as an "action/scary/good guys vs bad guys movie". Most but the broadest of jokes went over my head for my first several viewings I'm sure. But I still loved it, there was something gripping and effective and lasting about it. Like Back to the Future, while you'd be doing a huge disservice to the film, you could easily trim away the humor and have a rock solid story driven by great performances foremost. 

I don't foresee this movie ever having much subtlety. I don't predict the movie showing moments that are truly atmospheric and a bit scary, any philosophical moments...really, any moments that genuinely feel like humans experiencing something. </TEXT>

I have a lot of little quibbles with many songs over weird or improper word choices and what not...And this is probably the TMBG that grates on that part of my brain the most. It is such a fantastic, engaging, evocative song but the Kurtis Blow reference was obtuse when I heard the album in the late 90s, it's beyond nothing now. And not a challenging reference in a fun way the way, like, the Mesopotamians is. It's just a strange, out of place lyric among nearly every other song they have written. Like you said, it just jerks me out of the moment trying to process it. </TEXT>

I've been hoping that with the addition of weather there might be a change in the lighting to where it wasn't always 100% bright sun, razor crisp shadows everywhere at all times. Maybe now we'd get to have overcast skies occasionally.

But I assume it's the same case as when it snows and from the videos where active snowfall can be seen, it looks like that's not in the cards..which is disappointing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the demo of Thunderbird much more than The Spine's version, without the dropped lines and the one slowed down verse. A good copy of it is one of my white whales, I downloaded it off of YouTube when it was up there for a little while, and I think in the video comments it was said that there was a higher quality MP3 available at the same time but I never came across a link for it. And it feels impossible to effectively search for between Thunderbird live versions and an album version existing.

But still, any copy is better than none.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always love when a new map of yours pops up, as a fan of watercolor and mapmaking, they hit all my buttons. It's a wonderful balance of being informative and having a lot of personality. I too would love to be able to buy prints. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope, how balanced or realistic you make a building is completely up to you. There are several assets in the workshop(water pumps, power plants, dumps) that are extremely "overpowered" for people who want to just design a city aesthetically and not have to worry about plopping, like, fifty wind turbines to meet the power demands. They are great to have the option of using.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really hope someday we'll get a mod to get rid of crosswalks and arrows, it spoils the aesthetics to see them at every. Single. Intersection. And a hundred-fold so in this case where you have to jump through hoops to create a simple, common intersection like this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure it won't, cause the Wii U always seems to be left out in cases like this...even though it's far and away the most logical place to port to. Having the stylus to work with, unloading info panels into the gamepad...it could turn out to be something even more intuitive and quicker to work with than on the computer.

It's always nice when more people get exposed to a game, certainly, but I can't imagine what a pain it will be to pay with a game controller. Prison Architect isn't too terribly demanding, it's hard to imagine someone who had a next gen console wouldn't also have a decent enough computer and get a better play experience. </TEXT>

It's kinda like the new Ghostbusters movie...you start off with, from a creative/narrative point, a silly choice for really no good reason that in itself, without anything else about the project very well known, creates buzz and article fodder and your project becomes a bit critic-proof because everyone who slams it is misogynistic or racist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always wonder too. What really is the difference between someone posting a picture of their pet pot-bellied pig and they get a 1000 votes or whatever, and someone posting a relevant news story that also gets a 1000 votes? No one accuses someone who posts the news as going for that "sweet sweet karma", what the hell is the difference in the end? Is it that some of the imaginary, fake, non-currency is being siphoned away from something more worthwhile? 

Sure don't want to be too generous with content on a place where the only point is to put up content.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been talked about since week one, but not seriously enough to actually happen I guess. It seems easy, famous words of a layperson, compared to some other ideas considering the desired look is right there in the game, just need to "trick" the game into thinking it's in that edit mode. 

I really like the aesthetic and how it could effectively hide some of the asset repetitiveness and occasional cartoony color schemes. </TEXT>

The less evil intention or goals behind it(it's not like I'm not gonna call the gang Nazis if they do it) doesn't matter much to me, it's destroying something that Picasso, the only one who should have the choice, didn't destroy so it feels wrong.  </TEXT>
