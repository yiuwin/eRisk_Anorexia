	<TEXT> Happened to me a while back but i was using a bike. I was finished doing groceries so I head back to my bike. I plug in my keys and press start but the thing doesn't start so I start pumping on the pedal to manually start it. I was like that for a couple of 5-8 mins then I noticed that the keys wasn't turned to "on". I looked stupid.  
TLDR: been pressing start and pumping the pedal like crazy for a span of 5-8 mins turns out keys wasn't switched to "on". </TEXT>

The farmer is impressed. At lunch, the cock screws all 150 hens again. Now, the farmer starts getting worried. The next day, he finds the cock fucking the ducks, the geese, and the lone parrot too.
That evening the farmer finds the cock lying out in the field having a seizure and says "You deserve that you horny son of a bitch!".
And the cock says "I'll fuck you too after i finish with the ant". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kind of hate the experience that you are friends with your mom and her commenting to some of my shared posts and such. One time there was this comic post which I shared in which the admin of that page captioned "LOL". She commented on my shared post that said "Don't use LOL". I think she read one of those "don't use words post in fb" like lol means lucifer our lord. I face palmed farther than curiosity traveled in Mars. </TEXT>
