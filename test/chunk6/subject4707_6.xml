	<TEXT> Yeah defintely! The mind is a complex thing, men are just seen to be the physically stronger of the sexes so it seems we are expected to be the mentally stronger of both sexes. Because (very wrongly) women are given the sterotype of watching their weight too much, people think it's madness that men have anorexia.

I ALWAYS get ''did you think you were fat?''. Unfortunately anorexia needs a very big spot in the media for any changes to be made, but little steps and everyone will eventually know! Thank you for the kind words my friend, it means a lot! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah thats cool! SL is a really good workout to get starting strength. You'd eventually need a more complex workout to really get the gains after that, it's amazing to start with though.

Yeah exactly! When i first put a 75kg barbell on my back my thoughts went from ''this is too heavy'' to ''what the fuck im heavy'' xD </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah! Everyones generally noted that its a change to see someone on this subreddit who wanted to gain weight, it's usually losing it. I suppose the term 'fitness' is all relative!

And yeah thats fair enough, it is a bit strange! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats great! Not sure what your PT told you, but for me i did 7 weeks of lifting 5 days a week, then 1 week of complete rest. Doing 5x5 SL i did the main workouts on Monday/Weds/Friday, and isolate work on Tuesday Thursday with cardio. Did that for 7 weeks and then rested completely and thats been more than enough to get my gains so far!

Yeah thats quite crazy to think about it that way! </TEXT>

Barbell Squat 75kg, Deadlift 72.5kg, Bench 40kg, Barbell Row 40kg and Overhead Press 32.5kg currently. All are going up slowly! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah 100% I mean i weigh 75kg now, the most i'll probably ever weigh is 85kg so my weight is only going to slowly go up now. It's more about maintaining the weight than putting it on. I'm just happy i got to where i am! What are you currently lifting? If you dont mind me asking? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well being English, we tend to use weight measurements in stone and height in foot and inches. Since i assumed (may have been wrong of me!) that the rest of the world wouldn't understand stones, i used kg since thats the unit of measurement for the plates at the gym. Apologies! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you!

Self recovery is the best. I saw many therapists and specialists. It wasn't until i realised that it doesn't matter what they said or did, i had to do the work myself; that i was able to do it. Thanks again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was told a few tips at the start. The best way to stick to a diet is to simply not tell anyone you're on one. And also not to share your progress of weight (in terms of what you're lifting) till you're at a point you're happy. People tend to tell people what they're lifting, their brain experiences pleasure and happiness and then you stop. Dont. Keep lifting, keep going. People can find out you lift when they suddenly realise you're a lot bigger than they remember!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think because theres a lot of 'fat shaming' in the world, people have forgotten that theres another side of the spectrum. People think putting food in your mouth and swallowing is easy because they do it. Im glad you love your body, you're in it for life; need to love it! Love is always stronger than hate. Hatred is just the easy option. If it's easy, it's not worth doing. Keep doing you, proud! </TEXT>
