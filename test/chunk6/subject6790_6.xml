Pride has come a long way and will survive.
For now.

Also people sitting in the middle of College and Yonge for 30 fucking minutes at the start of the parade, causing the parade to be held up, people to faint from HEAT STROKE and the TTC to be held up so they could light smoke bombs and chant bullshit...  Is absolute crap.

Pride is political, but holy hell we DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO HIDING IN THE FUCKING CLOSET.

Shit like BLM TO just give fuel to the cause to defund Pride.

	<TEXT> The Cat Who series.
Lillian Jackson Braun did a really great job setting up this town and this wonderful character..

And then you could tell the writing of the series became harder...  The books that used to be 500 pages got whittled down to smaller and smaller, with plots that ruined character arcs that had been being worked on for years.
It broke my heart to read the last few books since I dearly loved the universe.
Picture the lead character like Sean Connery in his 50s.  Just a marvellous character.  And cats.  Oh the cats were wonderful to read about.  Such characters.

And then Lillian died.  Leaving the series open ended.  Mostly.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_Who...

"The Cat Who... is a series of twenty-nine mystery novels and three related collections by Lilian Jackson Braun and published by G. P. Putnam's Sons, featuring a reporter named Jim Qwilleran and his Siamese cats, Kao K'o-Kung (Koko for short) and Yum Yum. The first was written in 1966, with two more following in 1967 and 1968. The fourth appeared eighteen years later, after which at least one new novel was published every year until 2007. A thirtieth novel, originally announced for 2008, was postponed indefinitely by its publisher and then canceled after the author's death in 2011. It remains unpublished."
How utterly sad an end. </TEXT>

Apparently the complainant went into very graphic detail.  Ugh.  It would not have been pleasant to be in that courtroom.  I'm gay, but truthfully a lot of what people do during sex can be construed as...

Strange behaviour as it were.

That being said, sometimes these charges are very interesting to read about.  This one, not so much.... </TEXT>
