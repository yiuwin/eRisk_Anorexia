	<TEXT> I would highly suggest asking them if they would be willing to talk to your therapist. If its a good therapist, or even just someone who specializes in eating disorders, they should be able to explain it well. 

If you don't have a therapist, you should definitely try to get one. It is worth it financially.  </TEXT>
