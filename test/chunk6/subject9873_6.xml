	<TEXT> this doesn't really count since it resets you back to the beginning once you get to the top 2%, but I got to the last "level" of a game at the franklin institute where you would open a safe, it would display a code and display a percentage that you were in, and you would have to remember the code, close the safe, enter the code, and open the safe back up once it's entered and it would do the same thing. I got to the top 2% (and it never let me be in the top 1%, it just ended at 2% and reset) </TEXT>
