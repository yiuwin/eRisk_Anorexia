	<TEXT> I think he takes Cruz maybe 8 times out of 10.  But that's as long as he listens to his corner.  Whatever gameplan they had, TJ just didn't do a thing to follow it in the later rounds.  He had an easy path to victory with leg kicks and he just...wouldn't do it.  Very strange.  

Dodson, I think would be a huge problem for him, but I'd LOVE to see that rematch and find out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I first started watching this sport mid-last year, Barboza was one of the first guys I really fell hard for as a favorite fighter.  It was his leg kicks that really did it.  Just some talented, dangerous, nasty stuff. The two fights of his, prior to last night, I'd been able to see were fantastic, but didn't really showcase that as much.  It was nice to see him attack the leg in a live fight, and against such a high-caliber opponent.  </TEXT>

There is a lower limit to how many calories your body should be taking in.  Under eating IS a thing.  The important part is understanding the logic and difference between "starvation mode" bullshit, and sound advice. 

I definitely thought the article was sound advice.  

And for everyone kinda shitting on the blog, I'll have to disagree there as well. I've received a lot of motivation from their blog, and those recipes are pretty bad-ass majority of the time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, if I'm trying to do something like hammer a nail, or thread a needle, my hands begin shaking uncontrollably. It's insane.

I told my doctor about it, and the way she diagnosed me was fairly amusing. She told me to go home and get drunk and see if my hands shook then. If they didn't, the tremor was nothing to worry about and was just an intentional tremor and was likely indicative of nothing major. Sure enough, when I got home, had a few beers (so that I was tipsy, but not so drunk that I wouldn't be able to do the action regardless), and tried to do a complicated action, my hands weren't shaking. It was so strange.

Anyways, she said it was NBD, but they'd watch it as I get older to be certain. To my knowledge I have no brain injuries, strokes or MS, but that last one isn't out of the realm of possibility.

Thankfully I haven't had too much trouble with new phones, but I miss physical keyboards.  Slider phones were the best thing ever. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> SV/BMI - I'm at a "healthy" weight on both BMI charts </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-31 01:16:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wanted to wait until I weighed in consistently at my new weight before posting, but it's been a week now and all signs are pointing to finally achieving my main goal: I'm no longer overweight. On either BMI scale.  The new BMI made me lose an extra 5 pounds, I believe, but it's done now.  

I can not be more grateful to all of the subs I've been following as my struggle to get over final hurdles in the last year were beginning to get me down.  Now all I want is to get somewhere in the middle of the range and stay there.  

This is one of the happiest days of my life, to be honest. 

Thank you all again. 

How I did it: Counting calories and exercise worked for a long time, but I realized recently I was doing little snacking too often and not counting it. I got a food scale, started portioning my food out so I could snack throughout the day without busting my calorie limit.  Also started eating a lot more greek yogurt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha! I had this realization at one point, as well, and got super happy about it.  I needed to give my weight the other day when I was donating blood, and the lady was looking at my license at the same time as I said my current weight, and I chuckled to myself about being caught in my "lie".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I combated that by making my portion sizes way smaller, and then eating throughout the day.  I'm well withing my limits, and I'm hardly ever hungry, because my brain is getting it's craving satisfied.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wasn't there an ad campaign a while back about the face of depression?  How you can't just tell by looking at someone how deeply unwell they might actually be, in order to raise understanding of the way we treat people in our every day life.  If there isn't...there should be, lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I mentioned separately, I was disappointed with the layout of the book, but for the exact opposite reason.  The blog was a series of anecdotes about her childhood/life, until the very end, when it became very obvious that Brosh was going through something very big.  Before that moment, everything was pretty amusing/lighthearted. 

The book is structured in a way that it comes out hitting hard on the emotions from the start, with it being obvious she's got adjustment issues, through her (new?) entry about motivation, and the seemingly innocent letter to her 5 year old self suddenly takes a darker meaning when placed in such close contact with the darker stuff.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really disappointed in the way they laid this book out. I have been a fan for a long time, but by opening with so many of her more depressing entries, it makes the funny ones about her youth come across as dark foreshadowing, rather than amusing anecdotes about a uniquely amusing child.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sub is just way too negative. I wish every thread about new ideas didn't devolve into some argument about how the books are somehow unworthy because they have film adaptations or about the gender, nationality, whatever of the author. 

I haven't even felt like coming in here in two weeks because the conversation is so stagnant. Which really bums me out. 

Constructively, as I've said before, more threads promoting conversation about potential nominees and more fun fact threads would get me back into this a bit. I always knew comedy month would lose my interest, so hopefully I can get the spark back next month.

	<TEXT> Well, I've seen it said on here before that his reporting style is kinda changed since he started working for Fox. That he couldn't ask some of the tougher questions he would if he was independent, etc.  I'm sort of assuming, I guess, but yeah, it seems like this is what's best for him to be able to work to his fullest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was sad, then read his reasoning and I totally get it.  

EDIT: So there's no confusion. I don't mean to say he gave a clear cut reason.  I'm kinda jumping to conclusions on this.  I was only referring to him talking about already having a full time job.  As I said in a response below, I just kinda took this to mean he wants to focus more on that, it seemed to be the implication in his words.  There *could* be a bigger reason, I guess we may or may not find out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is more what I expected.  No offense to Holly, but all of that about them splitting coaches and whatever didn't make sense.  They seem to have a lot more invested in Andrei, and a better relationship.  Overeem seems to be at Jackson's to train, and that's it.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but if this is a question of loyalties, I'm not shocked to hear the team is "siding" with AA.  </TEXT>
