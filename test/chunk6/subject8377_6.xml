	<TEXT> I don't think you understand. At any given point, when you take a test you can have HIV, but the test can show a negative. For some people it can take up to 3 months for the antibodies to show. So if he had unprotected sex 2 weeks before his testing in December, it can show up as negative when he is in fact positive. Take HIV tests into consideration, but they are not determinate, unless you know the person's sex history, you really are delving into unknowns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I'm really not like that. I've been burned badly by people in the past - it's really drilled into me to favour personality over looks. There are some 'unattractive' people I would like to bang because they have amazing personalities. 

I'd say I have to agree and disagree. The hook-up app culture is what is making queers shallow. Tinder/Grindr is literally shopping for people, if you are paying the same amount ($0) for everyone, wouldn't you then just pick the 'best' one, especially if it's a hook up since you won't have to deal with their shitty personalities later on? I don't adopt the same philosophy personally, but that is a trend I am noticing.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know. I mean, what if you were working a low paying job and being able to afford rent on your own was not possible? Sure, if a person did nothing with their life then I can understand, but in some cases there are perfectly good reasons to stay. In Russia and a lot of Asia, if you are not married, it's seen as odd to just move out unless you really had your life together - but even if you did move out, you would have to be close to family. I moved out at 18 - had a decent paying job and I was living with my boyfriend. The only thing that made my family shut up over asking me why I even moved out was when I got married. *shrug* different cultures do shit differently </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on what you are losing. Once all the fat is gone, the muscle just vanishes really quickly. People with AN get what is called hypermetabolism where they require more calories than the normal person. If you aren't eating at all, this will just chew away at your muscle. I know this from experience. I had a low body fat percentage to begin with, and went from 120 pounds to 77 pounds in 5 months. I was also bedridden and couldn't walk because I was so weak.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I cheated. I wanted my boyfriend to break up with me because I was about to commit suicide. He didn't, so I gave myself anorexia and tried cheating again so he would get the picture. In my opinion it was easier for him to leave me over me doing a shitty thing, rather than to love me and watch me die. Sly bastard proposed to me and we've been married for 5 years now. If you're wondering why I didn't just tell him that I wanted to break up - if you love someone a lot, and they know it, telling them you want to break up is really unconvincing. I had told him, and he was right in not believing me. Also I had some serious mental health problems going on at the time so it was hard to even tell if I was being serious or it was my psychosis. 

Obviously this is very different to what you went through. In my opinion - forget about what he did, and instead focus on how you feel about the situation and realise what you feel comfortable with doing. His reasons are irrelevant, your reasons for staying or leaving are the most important - the ball is in your court, so don't even spare him the consideration of 'why' he did it. Just think to yourself if staying together - going through couple's counselling etc and if the goodness of your relationship is worth keeping, or if you are better off on your own or with someone else. I know you are trying to blame yourself, but if he never vocalised that there were fissures in your relationship, how would you have known? At the end of the day, he committed the action and now it hinges on you to decide if the relationship is worth saving.  </TEXT>

Another thing is my mouth and lips were numb for 2 days. I was really thirsty and so I took a drink. I was wondering why my shirt was getting wet and I realised I was pouring water down my front and not into my mouth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Hmmm, this doesn't quite make sense to me cuz if it were the case, wouldn't you at least keep a conversation going with this person? So that you could fuck later? Otherwise, I don't see them popping up a few months later and being like "we dated that one time and I ignored your messages but now we should fuck since I feel like it!"

Because if you keep a conversation going, you'd be accused of leading them on. I mean, what if they don't want to fuck you, but think 'maybe in the future'. It doesn't have to make practical sense - it's similar to how I collect a whole bunch of stuff thinking it might be useful later on (never is).

Full-time for most of us was working 3 days a week, earning a pay that was fairly average and unrewarding, not to mention the career progression is shit and the stability of work was abysmal. I was coming into work - at a major hospital btw - wondering if I was going to be let go within the next year. Most of my friends (over 2 years later) have still not found stable work in the field, going freelance and earning a pittance whilst they work retail.

But yeah, still rude. People should just be upfront, but at the same time, I have told people I don't want to screw them right now, or that I arranged to see someone else, but I would like to see them later and the response is almost always incredibly fucking rude.

	<TEXT> As long as you aren't smoking or drinking the damn thing, poppers are safe. Just don't use them in combination with other drugs which lower your blood pressure including Viagra. That is what will cause heart issues. Also don't use if you have some sort of heart problem or are quite prone to low blood pressure (not mid-low, but low), better to stay safe than sorry. 

As for what they are like, everyone has a different experience. For me it was like the feeling of being really relaxed and really turned on because my whole body was really warm, but I felt so loose and ready to be fucked. The high lasted maybe 3 minutes. I know people who sniff it multiple times when they fuck just to keep the high going.

Also they can give you some nasty headaches and the feeling of being really warm can take a while to go away. Depends on the person really </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ice it first, apply heat the day after. I recommend using a concealer, opt for an orange one and then cover it with one that matches your skin tone. The orange will cancel out the purple. The problem with make up, especially on the neck, is that it rubs off and can slide off from sweat etc. so you may need to use a primer and a setting spray to keep it in place all day. A lot of hassle imo

Depending on your hospital's dress policy, you can just wear a white turtleneck shirt underneath. It's what the Muslim employees do, so I don't see why you can't. If people start asking questions, just say you have an unsightly rash. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can get maxillofacial surgery. Depending on what your jaw is like now, it may involve extending and reshaping your jaw. It's quite an extensive surgery involving cutting up your jaw and reshaping and rearranging it using titanium plating. It's the most effective surgical option. You can also get some orthodontal work that helps extend the jaw, but once you're over 20 it's effectiveness decreases quite a bit, and surgery becomes the most, if not only, viable option.

Since jaw surgery is really invasive and is more for cases of TMJ, overbite and underbite, some surgeons may recommend a combination of liposculpture for your jaw and neck, and implants or fillers. Of course this all depends on what you need and what the surgeon thinks will work with you, the downside to this option is you can't extend the jaw forward, however rather than 1-2 months of healing, you'd have at most 2 weeks of healing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is funny to me, because my family has always been anti-war. In fact, my great grandparents studied medicine in the US and the UK. Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not only affect Japanese people, a lot of Americans in Japan also died and were wounded and now receive free medical care in Japan. I can never imagine the US doing the same for foreign visitors impacted by war. 

Just like how not a lot of people wish to follow Trump to the grave, a lot of Japanese did not like their own government. Think for a moment, if you faced war consequences due to a president you did not vote for and someone said that you deserved it because of that government - the one you did not endorse, how would you feel? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the question. This is going to be long, so strap yourself in!

This really depends on when and who in the family, as well as who is doing the discrimination. My grandmother's family did not experience stigma since her parents were doctors in Hiroshima she was born in Tokyo, a month or so after the bombing and was born without obvious defect, in fact she was relatively healthy most of her life so she wasn't seen as a survivor of Hiroshima. 

It wasn't until my mother and her sister were born that it became clear something was wrong. Mom's sister died as an infant, she had underdeveloped organs and tumours. My mother had leukaemia as a child and bone problems. My grandmother was granted Hibakusha status meaning they were recognised victims of the bombings - her and my mother received government payment and support as well as free healthcare. 

But socially is a different thing, while they had government support and medical professionals all agree to help them, there was societal discrimination. Mom couldn't go to school, and when they moved to Osaka, she was still isolated from other students. Getting into university was hard for her, so much so she moved to Russia where she met my dad. She ironically studied nuclear medicine, and when she went back to Japan no one would hire her.

My mother could not get IVF in Japan, and no one wanted to marry my parents. So she had to permanently move to Russia. As horrible as it all sounds, my mother never felt resentful. In Japan to marry means to have children and my mother having children meant passing on her flawed genes, they also believed that her conditions were contagious hence why she was always isolated or discriminated. 

As for now, her youngest half brother is an active pacifist who joins rallies and events in support of recognition of Japanese war crimes and the discrimination against bombing survivors. I know children of hibakusha who experience discrimination - they can't find work because employers think they will be sick or die, they can't find partners because of the same reason and because they 'can't have children'. Essentially it is treated like having a disability except a lot of us are completely fine. I'm lucky in that when people know that I am descended from Hibakusha, I am not treated with disrespect, because I'm gay and won't pass it on. If anything, I've faced more discrimination in the US because I'm a living example of the atrocities committed, just as I would imagine the descendants of comfort women would upset some people in Japan. It's always wonderful hearing that I should never have been born and that my great grandparents should have died. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's exactly the thing. Both have committed atrocities, but if America fails to acknowledge what it did, so will Japan. 

I'm on the other side of this story. My mother's side of the family were victims to the bombing of Hiroshima. My grandmother was born with genetic defects causing her to pass on a variety of cancers through the family line. My mother died, having lived through infertility, bone issues and after I was born (5the IVF attempt) she spent most of my life in hospital getting chemotherapy, and I myself have had two cancer scares and I'm only 24. 

War does no one good and we should stop pretending and pointing fingers and just own up to the nature of war - an act against humanity where people on all sides commit inhumane things. Rather than just sugar-coating history with stories of valour and camaraderie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't jerk off before you work out. Jerk off afterwards. Ejaculation increases basal levels of testosterone, but immediately after ejaculation your testosterone drops and melatonin (what makes you sleepy and tired) starts to kick in which basically tells your body it's time to sleep, hence why you would feel and look tired. You have the melatonin to blame here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do think it is rude when people have 'no fats' on their profiles, and I am a skinny dude. It's a turn off. However, I feel like racial rejection is worse. They are rejecting you not because you are necessarily unattractive or a bad person, they are rejecting you because of stereotyped reasons like penis size, employment status, clinginess, perceived societal value and sex appeal etc. 

People can argue it's a preference, and for some people it is. But when most of my Grindr messages are assumptions I'm submissive, frigid and a virgin because I'm of Asian descent, or the phrase "You're hot for an Asian" or "Oh you're half white, no wonder you're hot." Then yeah, pretty hard to see how it isn't racism </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True. I loved Bethesda's marketing that they did for FO4. CDPR in my experience have always been a little vague with marketing. There was hardly much hype with Witcher 3 (at least, not compared to Dragon Age) and really, it works quite well. They have a huge dev team on board working on this new game, much larger than Witcher 3 apparently,  so I wouldn't be surprised if there are a lot of concepts in the game they have to really sift and filter through to determine what information they should release and when.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't worry. You really are not alone. I worked for a year as a speech pathologist and was crazy underemployed- only had work 3 days a week. I kept applying for full time positions but no one wanted to take me on/there just wasn't much available. So I geared up, got another degree and now work as a nurse. For 3 whole years I was stuck working part time and casual as a speech pathologist and even when studying again, I was still applying to full time roles with the hope of just dropping the nursing degree and doing what I set my passions to. Never landed.

	<TEXT> Sort of. Having a health related degree put me into an accelerated nursing course which condensed 4 years into 2 years. I feel like I had the benefit of knowing how to conduct myself on placements and working directly with patients, but at the same time I feel like nursing is more meeting KPIs, whereas speech pathology was essentially a desk job that was more patient focussed.

However, I'm a surgery nurse, my interactions with patients are restricted to them unconscious on the operating table, lol. But it is beneficial in getting your foot in the door in a hospital and health system since you will have been familiar with a specialised sector. I do believe it helped me get into surgery and be able to take on an advanced role - realistically, I can work specifically within neurosurgery and ENTs as I have the background knowledge and experience for that on a theoretical level. 

I can also work as a rehab nurse for those with speech issues - assuming my role as speech pathologist again, but with the ability to medicate and treat. But I chose to work in surgery, mostly because no one else wants to and I felt maybe this was all a sign to take on a role that was desperately starved for people. 

The pay is shit, other nurses think you're incompetent and the hours are long, but the surgery team is such a tight knit family and I can always rely on having work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. I experienced the same thing with psychology and becoming a speech pathologist. All of my work was casual or part-time, and I worked at a major hospital. So I went back to uni and now work as a full-time registered nurse - there were only 190 positions in my program at USYD, about 120 graduated, and I was the only one who became an operating room nurse. There is a massive shortage in this sector, but because of its unpopularity, universities are not opening up the course. Honestly, I've worked overtime almost every single day since I started and I am really dreading the 14 hour shift I have this coming Monday, having more people would really help.  </TEXT>
