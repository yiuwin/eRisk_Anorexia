	<TEXT> Basically a dissociative hallucinogen that can be found in (don't laugh) certain brands of cough syrup (namely Robitussin DM.)  When ingested in high doses, one can go as high as the fourth level, although I'd recommend you start with a low dose (about 300mg, or one bottle)  and work your way up from there. It's not for everyone but I enjoy it and I'd recommend you try it out :) </TEXT>
