	<TEXT> There was a teacher and a class, one of the students went up to the teacher and said: "Can I go to the toilet?", the teacher said: "Only if you can recite the alphabet for me.", "a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.", the teacher said: "Where's your 'p'?", the student said: "Running down my trousers miss." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No worries mate. Thanks for the info, that's really cool what you've done. Right now I'm just uploading my stuff to SoundCloud and am slowly improving my skill. I might consider DJ-ing for a bit of cash. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this is irrelevant, but this post got me thinking about the difference between a baby, kid, child etc. I found this and was enlightened: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-an-infant-a-baby-a-kid-and-a-child </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've already got all the gear I need; my laptop and studio monitors. I'm using FL Studio, Serum and Nexus 2. I think I gave the impression that I hadn't started making music. Iv'e been producing for about six months now, making dance music. My theory knowledge is fairly decent as my mother's full time job was a music theory teacher. I'm fairly confident with DJ-ing and mixing, but have never done it for an audience. Right now I'm not making any money from what I'm doing, so I was really just wondering if you make a decent living from it, and you don't feel under pressure to produce a new track. Thanks for your input. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently making or *trying* to make dance music and would gladly give up a regular job to pursue this hobby. I want to know the perspective of someone in the industry who makes a living from it. 

**My 5 Questions:**

1. What's your work schedule?
2. Do you ever feel under pressure?
3. Did you work hard to get where you are?
4. What software are you using?
5. How did you start out? </TEXT>
