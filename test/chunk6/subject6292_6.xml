	<TEXT> Wow so much hate here. Relax. You don't like this for whatever reason? Just keep scrolling, no reason to post shitty judgmental comments. 

And everyone who is saying "one year olds don't know what's going on" either you don't have kids, or your kids are really spaced out because my daughter had a blast at her birthday party. And why wouldn't we want to celebrate our child's life each year? So maybe she won't remember her first few, but she had an extra fun day and we all got to celebrate her with friends and family.  </TEXT>
