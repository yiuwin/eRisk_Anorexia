	<TEXT> I saw him live in London, he was doing one of his technical difficulties panel shows live.

The funniest thing I've been to in a long time. I laughed my ass off and has a great time. Go check out the technical difficulties: citation needed. It's a panel show. British style. Just go check it out.


Shout out to Jay Foreman, who was our warm-up act. He was equally hilarious and I spoke to him after the show. Told him about Reddit, he said he might do an AMA, but clearly he hasn't got around to it yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If Napoleon had destroyed the Royal Navy's home fleet at Trafalgar, there would have been nothing substantial standing in the way of invasion. That being said, there were substantial shore batteries guarding any viable landing site. Landing troops and seizing a port would be difficult as the only way to get any sizable amount of troops ashore would by rowing boats. They don't move very fast obviously and would be a sitting duck to any shore battery. In the unlikely event they get ashore, the French forces would need to take a port with shore facilities suitable for offloading troops and supplies. Even if the main large combat ships of the Royal Navy had been destroyed, there would still be enough small sloops, brigs and frigates to make resupply of French troops rather difficult.

So, in conclusion, a French victory at Trafalgar would have resulted in a French landing attempt. How successful this would be is unknown, but taking the British Isles would not have been easy for the French forces.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The church, from it's inception, has been forced to adapt with the times. I believe that many things in the bible, especially in today's society, have to be taken with a pinch of salt and especially in the old testament, not taken literally. The New Testament, on the other hand, I believe to be the pure word of God and is an instruction manual to live our lives. Unfortunately, as with many instruction manuals, we like to think we know what we're doing, but we get to the end and there's a piece that's supposed to be in the middle of it all, so you know you've mucked up somewhere. That's why people need God, because they need someone looking over their shoulder, telling them to read the instruction manual and follow it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Warrior. Watched it on Netflix out of boredom because it had Tom Hardy in it. Itr exceeded my expectations simply because I went into it not having any.

It was brilliant, and the [song at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef1nJWtkprU) still gives me chills. Probably one of my favourite films now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that maybe you took the wrong side.

I wouldn't worry about what happens in the next life. I would focus on the here and now. 

I would pray for him and try to reconnect. I  wouldn't throw away what could be a beautiful relationship on the grounds of him not yet finding God and having a relationship with him.

From what you've said, he seems like a decent guy. Don't throw something beautiful.

My dad has said many times that one thing in his life he regrets is not pursuing a relationship with a girl who he was very good friends with, but she was Catholic and at the time, he had it in his head that he couldn't marry her, because he was CofE. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see where you are coming from. I have had wobbles like that myself.

For me, it comes down to probability. The scientific method and process of analysing and explaining evidence has shown how mind bogglingly unlikely our very existence is.

On top of that, we have yet no explanation for how or why the Big Bang occurred. One explanation is that someone or something caused it.

Now, don't get me wrong, I am not one of those 'the world is 4 thousand years old' Christians, who deny scientific evidence that is placed in front of their face. I simply apply my experience and knowledge to explain that which I have no preexisting explanation for. All of that points to God. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The story is a parable, telling how God works and teaching how to have faith with God.

And yes. God does require one to pray to get help. Prayer is a conversation with God, and part of Prayer is repentance of sins and wrongdoings. It is unreasonable to expect help from someone to  whom you still owe an apology. Does that make sense?

As to the last paragraph, I see what you mean. An omnipotent being would be everywhere at once and able to influence everything simultaneously.

Sorry if I appear thick, but what is your point to the last paragraph? </TEXT>
