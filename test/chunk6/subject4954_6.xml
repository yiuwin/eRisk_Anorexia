	<TEXT> Pretty cool and a great first attempt. If you want to add a bit of virtuosity, consider also animating the flames' reflection in the table. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "OCD" - I couldn't agree more. His process is downright bizarre! And I found that fascinating. It made me go back and listen to so many other Weezer songs in a new way, wondering about the real meaning and process behind them. I'm certainly not going to start cataloging phrases in a spreadsheet by number of syllables and stress, but the entire podcast was so eye-opening as to all of the possibilities. I found it really thought provoking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not an exact match, but if you listen to a bunch of Song Exploder podcasts you pick up a lot about how the industry works for artists at varying levels of prominence. For example, the Metallica Song Exploder feels a lot different than the Perfume Genius one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is really worth a listen, showing the mental gymnastics and daily disciplines required for Rivers Cuomo to keep writing music that feels fresh for him. It shows me there aren't really any rules--each songwriter has to figure out what works for him or her to wrestle that muse out of the mind and get songs made. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But now that you mention, he's worth a good listen (plus, someone I've met from my hometown). His track 1976, from Since We Last Spoke, is absolutely perfect. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-xN-o6W90  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should listen to DJ Shadow Entroducing like ten times. That album was so ahead of its time. It basically defined a genre. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice job. I'm wondering if you're a fan of DJ Shadow or Moby. I detect influences of both.

Keep at it. As you mentioned, the length is probably a slight problem if you want your music to be digestible and heard. Finding the editor within ourselves is one of the hardest parts of being an artist. </TEXT>
