	<TEXT> It does not have an indicator, just like the poke after headbutt the Warlord does. I don't think you can parry it any more since the buff. On story mode the character buffs/nerfs are not in effect like in MP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He means the style of gameplay from the XCOM series, made by 2k and Firaxis also, not the late game unit from Civ 5. The one in 5 is just like a little Easter Egg to their other game series. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Remove Input Queue Please </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I don't know about you guys, buy I really hate the input queueing. What I mean by that is when you push one button then another quickly after it and the game acts as though they were simultaneous. Or you try to do one action quickly after something else for a combo but instead does them separately without the desired effect. 

Examples would be like as a lawbringer stepping back, letting go and then hitting GB but instead of the break he does a long arm. Example of second kind for same character would be hitting GB for shove mix-up after block while also moving and swapping guard direction so instead of shove he just awkwardly grabs at the air after the block. Or I've had it happen as Raider making zone attacks when buttons are done one after the other.

It happens with other heroes as well. One other benefit could be possible fix on the zone attack flicker since it wouldn't be one attack detected before the zone took over. Not entirely sure on that last one but that is how it seems.

I hope others are irritated with this as much as I am because I feel it really should be removed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found it to be a really surprising game. It really gets in your head as you progress. The main character(commander shepherd twin) gets progressively more disheveled and violent as it goes on. Then he's completely nuts at the end, imagining like almost everything. Even had different endings!

But I think one of the most underrated pieces was the MP. It was actually really fun! It just had bad matchmaking and low population. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had them on every single thing on the multi-player map since launch..... It is so annoying. Now my conqueror has one for a chest piece that doesn't exist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also if they like to side dodge after the shove to light, finish that combo with a side heavy and it will catch up to them for a good hit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm just curious if the new characters, from this upcoming season and also beyond, will be able to use the customization items you unlock from the story. Like the engravings and how each hero gets an ornament. Anyone know anything about this? </TEXT>
