	<TEXT>  I was doing some serious skimming because, one, I was too nervous to know what was going to happen.

I think that's the mark of a good mystery or suspense book. When they have you skimming/skipping ahead because you're so anxious/curious to see what happens.

 I was going through a rough time, I had just fallen in love with characters from a series I never knew existed, and to be honest, I didn't even know there were more books after this one

Outlander and DiA (the parts in Scotland) are my favorite books of the series. The cast of characters that we meet in Scotland back in the the 1740s were my favorite characters of the series, and have really come to life on screen with this fantastic TV adaption.

I'm going to be sad to see it all over.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Was it to prove to Claire he was a true psycho?

I think it was because he was enraged at the position Alex put him in (having to wed Mary).

 A little too much Collum/ Dougal at the end there.

Well we know Dougal will die next week, so I view it as giving his character some more humanity, as well as giving Graham McTavish a chance to show off his acting chops.

Great acting by Graham McTavish and Gary Lewis as usual. 

 Murtagh proposing marriage was sweet. The whole time watching that part I was literally shouting at the screen "Holy shit, they might #SaveMurtagh after all!" But alas, that is also not meant to be. Don't leave us, my beautiful eyebrow man.....

Yeah, I enjoyed that scene. As with Dougal, I think the showrunners might be giving these characters to some more depth and humanity....before they meet their unfortunate fates.

Yes, Rose is the hometown hero but think logically. Put yourself in GarPax's shoes.

As you said, "side plot really disrupts the flow of a hugely emotional conclusion".

  I wonder if they'll want to acknowledge Murtagh dying, because it seems almost cruel to let people think he'll be in the next season . . . 

Damn, I almost forgot about that.

I hope the show deviates from the book and shows Murtaugh's death. This season or at the beginning of the next.

	<DATE> 2016-06-19 18:23:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My predictions:

Episode 12: Alex Randall is dying. A deal is made. Mary is wed off to Black Jack; BPC remains a jackass and delusional; Claire conspires against BPC, and we finish off with the emotional death of Dougal. 

I hope Dougal is giving a fitting sendoff. He may be hot-headed, but in his mind he is nothing more than a patriot and doing what is right for his country. I hope that is somehow portrayed in his TV show death.

Episode 13: I think half of this episode will deal with Jamie and Claire. Probably some arguing about going "back". Some emotional scenes. Then going back to the stones. Some more emotional scenes...Then she finally goes back once the British arrive.

Time jump to 1968: I don't know if/how much of Frank will be featured in this episode. IDK, maybe they show his car accident. Brie and Claire go back to Scotland. They meet Roger. Claire tells Brie about the time travel. Roger does some research...

I think the final scene may mirror the book, where Roger tells Claire: "There was a Frasier of the Jacobite Army who lived. He must've tried to die but he lived......"

Cut to Claire. Cut to the credits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Wow, that was a great episode. I was worried they wouldn't be able to fit all the important stuff in, but it totally worked. It was tense from start to finish, and even though I know what happens I was on the edge of my seat.

I was pretty impatient throughout the episode because I know what was to come, and I was anticipating it.

I'll have to watch the episode again to appreciate it.

I'm just glad we got some resolution, and that the plot with Sandringham wasn't prolonged till next week.

  Simon Callow is the real ace in the hole of this cast

I agree that Callow is fantastic, but for me personally Tobias Menzies is the "ace in the hole" for the show.

  I was also glad to have (hopefully) Hugh's life spared

Likewise! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   Isn't that kind of depressing? 

Depressing? No, not for me at least.

Bittersweet, absolutely. 

The fatalism and sense of loss was what made Reach so intriguing to me. Especially when you, the player, know how it's going to end.

Before I watched Titanic I knew how it was going to end, but what James Cameron did was envelop me in the story so that I lived the tragedy in the moment. 

I think Reach accomplished the same thing.

I cared for the characters, and I felt their loss as well (not to sound too..sappy).

 That's great, considering I enjoyed it then too.

I think the silent majority enjoyed it for the most part, but the vocal minority were louder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  but why keep it secret for decades after the fact? Surely we'd have heard about it by now? Typically the period for keeping weapons platforms secret is about 10-15 years.

What if this wasn't a weapons platform per se, and the intent was to determine whether hysteria could be induced?

IE. The military conducting a social-experiment to determine whether a population could be convinced that lights in the sky could be of ET origin.

To determine whether a War of the Worlds type hysteria could ever be conducted on demand in the future.

Something similar to Project Palladium where a UFO sighting could be induced with Radar-spoofing +  "balloon-borne metalized spheres of different sizes". 

http://ufotrail.blogspot.com/2014/06/ufo-tunnel-vision.html

A hoax, or deception.

 Why haven't we been told that this was what it was

Maybe, according to this Social Experiment theory, to keep the option open in the future.

 and why haven't the aviation enthusiasts, who usually know much more about black budget aircraft rumours, heard about it? 

Maybe this wasn't an expensive, advanced, black budget aircraft, but a low-budget (relative to the military) jerry-rigged airship(s)/balloon(s) social-experiment device/platform.

Anyway, that's all speculation, and I know it sounds conspiratorial, but I think it's a valid theory to consider. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was no joy in those crazy Alex Jones mythology episodes we got this year. 

And how exactly are we even going to come back from that cliffhanger? The show would have to be something post-apocalyptic, like Falling Skies.

Fuck it. Write it off. No explanation necessary. 

Just go with MOTW episodes. </TEXT>

Although the episode of Claire's miscarriage was the best of the series, I haven't been fully interested in season 2 as I was season 1.

But this was an amazing episode.

I loved Stephen Walters' portrayal of Angus; he made season 1 so much fun, and he will be *sorely* missed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SS: An in-depth articles that shows Sanders' "Revolution" was never one that included minorities.

It states minorities weren't seriously interested in a "revolution" to begin with: 

 People of color, like their white Democratic counterparts, may also want a revolution and more rapid progress than the halting kind that comes with pragmatism, but theyve time and again seen incremental change improve their lives. Thats why they embrace Martin Luther King Jr. without question while revering Malcolm X from a distance. Thats why they are much more enthusiastic about the Affordable Care Actwhich has helped minority Americans the most than white progressives who have either been lukewarm or, in some cases, even hostile to health reform because they dont believe it was radical enough. </TEXT>

Drama ensues, but at some point they'll defect to the US or become double agents.

	<TEXT> So funny:

Because I wanted you." He turned from the window to face me. "More than I ever wanted anything in my life," he added softly.

I continued staring at him, dumbstruck. Whatever I had been expecting, it wasn't this. Seeing my openmouthed expression, he continued lightly. "When I asked my da how ye knew which was the right woman, he told me when the time came, I'd have no doubt. And I didn't. When I woke in the dark under that tree on the road to Leoch, with you sitting on my chest, cursing me for bleeding to death, I said to myself, 'Jamie Fraser, for all ye canna see what she looks like, and for all she weighs as much as a good draft horse, this is the woman'"

I started toward him, and he backed away, talking rapidly. "I said to myself, 'She's mended ye twice in as many hours, me lad; life amongst the MacKenzies being what it is, it might be as well to wed a woman as can stanch a wound and set broken bones.' And I said to myself, 'Jamie, lad, if her touch feels so bonny on your collarbone, imagine what it might feel like lower down...'"

He dodged around a chair. "Of course, I thought it might ha' just been the effects of spending four months in a monastery, without benefit of female companionship, but then that ride through the dark together"--he paused to sigh theatrically, neatly evading my grab at his sleeve--"with that lovely broad arse wedged between my thighs"--he ducked a blow aimed at his left ear and sidestepped, getting a low table between us--"and that rock-solid head thumping me in the chest"--a small metal ornament bounced off his own head and went clanging to the floor--"I said to myself..."

He was laughing so hard at this point that he had to gasp for breath between phrases. "Jamie...I said...for all she's a Sassenach bitch...with a tongue like an adder's ...with a bum like that...what does it matter if she's a f-face like a sh-sh-eep?"

I tripped him neatly and landed on his stomach with both knees as he hit the floor with a crash that shook the house.

"You mean to tell me that you married me out of love?" I demanded. He raised his eyebrows, struggling to draw in breath.

"Have I not...just been...saying so?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  but this should never become a catch-all explanation for hard to explain events.

I agree. But with some UFO cases, the debate isn't whether something is hard to explain, but rather did something in fact happen at all?

 It's too easy to dismiss accounts of children by saying, "oh, they didn't know what a parachute or a big balloon looked like," and move on.

I agree to an extent. But..they are still kids. I'm not saying all kids are fools who can't distinguish between balloons and a theoretical flying saucer. But they do have active imaginations, for better or worse.

 It's too easy to dismiss accounts of children by saying, "oh, they didn't know what a parachute or a big balloon looked like," and move on.

With regards to the Westall case, I'm mostly agnostic. I'd say there are a couple of options:
Possibility 1. Balloon that kids with active imaginations imagined as a flying saucer. 
Possibility 2. A flying saucer as the kids perceived it (could be ET, could be a military device "dressed up" as a flying saucer, could be a civilian hoax).

Either of these possibilities might lead to a police/military investigation.  

As you said, there is a lot of bullshit surrounding this case, so it's hard to make an informed decision.

Frankly, there isn't much evidence at all to support Possibility 1 or 2. Other than witness testimony, there isn't much evidence.

Decades later, all we can truthfully say is that the kids saw something, but we don't know what it was. </TEXT>
