	<TEXT> Well, yesterday was my first day, I had 346 calories which consisted of basically eggs and coconut oil. I lost 1.4 pounds since yesterday. I'm guessing most of that is water weight but holy hell I like keto! I feel so much fuller eating fat + protein compared to any amount of carb. I stayed full for like 4.5 hours after eating 2 eggs with coconut oil.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keto Day 2!

Breakfast: 2 whole eggs (140) + 10g coconut oil (86)

Lunch: Nothing

Dinner: 2 cups baby arugula (20) + 3 oz chicken breast (90) + 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (13) + 7g butter (50)

Total: 399

I've been feeling slightly nauseated since starting keto. I attribute this to the fact that I'm not used to eating so much fat. Is this normal? Will it go away eventually? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know what, I looked into it and there are some jerkys with only 3g carbs! I'm only on day 2 of keto. I plan on going all week and seeing how I feel. If I like it and decide to stick with it, I'll add jerky to my grocery list for next week! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But I heard that in the US there are quite few people smoking!

There is *definitely* a huge stigma against cigarette smoking in the US. It's getting less and less common. It's rare to see anyone smoking in public. I live in Vegas, so it's a bit different. But when I go back to Chicago no one is out on the street smoking.

	<TEXT>  plan meals so that you're eating a protein bar or something while you're with them

I've started doing that. Well, I did it once. I mixed a protein shake and had a stick of cheese in front of one of my trainers. Not sure if she saw me eat/drink, but I tried!!! I can't really do that anymore as I've started keto and so far all the food I eat has to be cooked beforehand.

	<TEXT> My problem is my close friend let it slip to both of my horse trainers that I've had an eating disorder in the past. Now that they know that, I kind of walk on eggshells around them. When I go to the barn I *try* to wear clothes that'll hide my weight loss. It's awkward because I know that they know about my ED, but they don't know that I know they know. Wow what a clusterfuck of a sentence!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just feel very lucky that I've always somehow managed to stay pretty healthy and don't have long term negative effects and idk want to keep things that way to the extent possible.

That's the most important thing, babe! I'm really proud of you for having a rational side to yourself while dealing with an ED. 

I have it set in stone that my GW is 85. For my height, that's not *horribly* underweight. But I have a lot of people who care about me (lol I'm saying that like it's a bad thing) and I feel like if I even dipped below 90 it would raise a lot of eyebrows. Especially being an athlete and all, I fear my trainers will refuse to train me if I don't eat or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it helps, I went to London 2 summers ago for ~2 weeks and I found myself not eating *that* much and walking a LOT. On average, 17k steps per day. Basically I would wake up in the morning, have a chocolate bar (Kinder Bueno is delicious omg) and latte from Starbucks, go do touristy things while walking around all day, and at around 4pm/5pm I'd have a normal sized dinner at a restaurant. If I got hungrier later at night, I'd have a glass or two of wine or a cocktail and call it a day. I gained 3 pounds (mostly water weight) in those 2 weeks but within 2 days of restricting I was back down to my pre-London weight. Occasionally I would indulge in a treat while doing touristy things like an ice cream cone, crepe, piece of fresh bread, but it wasn't every day.  </TEXT>

It was going well but I'd find myself eating 800 then 700 then 600 then hardly anything. I *had* to count calories and weigh/measure all my food to lose the weight and it just triggered so many ED thoughts and behaviors. So here I am. </TEXT>

The occasional whole egg for added fat, too. Oh, also lemon juice (fresh) and baby arugula! I'm quite excited. I'm doing a trial keto day today and I had 2 whole eggs as an omelette cooked in 7g coconut oil and it was really good! I had it 2 hours ago and I'm still very satiated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Is there anything you plan on changing this month? What are your goals this month?**

For me, I would *really* like to be down 14 pounds by the end of May/weigh in at 100 pounds. I weighed in at 114 this morning (YAS only 3 pounds away from my lowest adult weight). I'm also going to try a week of keto to see if that helps with water weight and things like that. If I like it, then I might just stick with it. I don't have any social obligations this month aside from a date with this guy on Thursday, so hopefully nothing else ruins my progress like the 2 social weekends I had in April did.

	<TEXT> Going to switch to higher fat dairy as well, even if it means I won't be able to have as much.

Yep this is what I was thinking of last night! I usually buy 0% Fage Greek yog but I might buy full fat or 2% just to meet that fat goal. 

I've even been thinking about getting that pre-cooked/microwaveable bacon (35 cal a slice) and have that with an egg for breakfast. 1 egg + 2 strips of that bacon would come out to a 140 cal breakfast, which isn't too bad. 

Agh people always talk about avocado but for some reason I just can't stomach it! I know, I'm strange. Everyone loves avocado, right? The consistency just throws me off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually have a second scale. My mom left it in the house when she moved so unfortunately I can't break it because it belongs to her! Her scale reads everything 1.6 pounds higher and...I've lost a pound since yesterday! I can't believe it. But oddly enough I didn't get the high I'm used to getting from dropping a large amount of weight overnight. Maybe because I was so upset yesterday. Maybe I just feel guilty for losing weight? I don't know. 

We're going to this Mexican restaurant that I'm familiar with. I'm planning on getting chicken fajitas with extra chicken and no rice, beans, etc. I'll just tell him I'm doing keto (which isn't a lie, I'm actually planning on trying keto this coming week). And yes! In the past when I'd restrict and still go out to eat, I'd make my restaurant meal the only thing I eat that day. I might have a cup of yoghurt or something earlier in the day because I have a riding lesson and I can't do that on an empty stomach. 

I really want to be able to get comfortable with the idea of maintenance. As much as I *love* losing lots of weight rapidly, I don't think I can continue doing that unless I want to be semi-forced into IP. I'm thinking *maybe* once I hit 105 I'm going to think about maintaining for a few weeks.

	<TEXT>  If you eat below maintenance every day, you will lose weight. Full stop.

Ugh I try to remind myself that, especially since I eat 1100-1300 calories below maintenance every day! I guess the biggest thing with restrictive type eating disorders is the high you get when you see massive drops. I *live* for that high. Not seeing that massive drop doesn't give me the high, and it makes me feel like shit :(

I'm really trying to minimize ED thoughts/attitudes outside of restriction, I guess as a form of harm reduction.

I had been letting myself have my daily beer or glass of wine only if I had a good weigh in

These are both really good points. In the past when I'd have relapses with my eating disorder, I would still drink a glass or two of wine at night and I would still go out and have meals with friends, then just go back to restricting the following day - I didn't feel bad about eating a 1200 calorie meal in one sitting. But my relapse has gotten *so bad* to the point where I'm isolating myself completely. I don't see my friends anymore, not even if it's just to hang out at their house, because I fear food will be involved. 

On the bright side, I have a dinner date scheduled with this guy next Thursday. It'll be one of those times where that dinner is all I eat for the day, then I go back to restriction the following day. Sure, restriction isn't good, but at least there's a *chance* where I'll be more willing to lead a semi normal life and not let my disordered eating get in the way...does that even make sense? Like, as you said, harm reduction. It's one thing to restrict your intake but it's another thing to allow your eating disorder to consume *every little* part of your life, which is what is happening to me right now. 

Which scale is it you have? And yeah I've never had one of those bf% scales because I know seeing a bf% will make matters worse for me. 

Thank you so much for your words of support!!! 3 3 </TEXT>

I do my food shopping on Monday and I'm going to try to buy high fat high protein foods. The only reason I've been consuming quite a few carbs lately is because I had been trying to finish up all my safe foods (which were all carb laden) before my next grocery store trip. 

What are some keto safe foods you stick to? So far my keto list includes almond milk, eggs, peanut butter, string cheese and Greek yoghurt.  </TEXT>

Anyways. I am in a similar predicament as I have a first date on Thursday :3 we are going to a Mexican restaurant so I'm thinking I'll get some chicken fajitas with no tortilla, rice, beans, etc. I find that grilled meat + veggies is the safest thing. If you skip on the carbs like I plan on doing, just tell you friends you're trying to eat low carb/keto? That's what I'm planning on telling my date if he asks. 

What kind of restaurant are you going to? I find steakhouses, Mexican and Indian restaurants to be the safest because they tend to always have grilled/roasted/baked lean meats.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had been only consuming liquids today. I had 2 cups of coffee and a protein shake. I don't know why I weighed myself. I didn't expect the number to be lower than this morning because I know I have lots of liquids in my system. I weighed in at 1 pound higher than this morning, which I expected. 

After that I just lost it. I stomped on my scale really hard because I was so angry. Angry that I'm a slave to this stupid device. I hopped back on and it stopped working. I put new batteries in it and it gave me fucked up readings (e.g. 56 pounds at one point then 23 pounds at another point). I was fed up. So I threw it on the ground. Hard. I went to the garage and threw it around some more until it totally shattered.

I feel relieved but at the same time I'm *fucking terrified*. Now I can't weigh myself. I have another scale but it's horribly inaccurate. I can't afford to buy another scale until Monday and it kills me to not be able to weigh myself tomorrow *and* it kills me that a new scale I might buy may also be horribly inaccurate. I loved my scale. But I hated it, too, so I killed it. 

On that note, any scale recommendations? The most accurate in your opinion? 

I'm going to cry now. I hate this disease, this disorder. I wish I could be normal. I feel like dying.

**Edit:** Mods? I guess delete this post if it somehow breaks the rules?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you're also losing muscle

I'm an athlete and have worked *so* hard to put on the muscle I currently have! Will eating more protein help lose fat instead of muscle? 

At this point I'm thinking I might start having to hit the gym again which is a fuckkkking pain because I'm eating so low cal, I hardly have any energy to go to the gym, especially since I still ride 4x a week. Do thinks like having a higher cal day help at all? Say I were to eat 800 one day then the next go back down to 350-400, would the drop in weight loss be dramatic like it used to be? I remember after 1 day of coffee fasting I dropped 1.2 pounds in 24-36 hours. I miss that :/ </TEXT>

Secondly, AGHH. This fucking blows. And like, I'm not even at a very low weight! My BMI is 21.7. More than anything, what's killing my vibe is the *high* I get from dropping large amounts of weight rapidly. Like, I may as well be eating at a 750 cal deficit instead of a 1500 cal deficit!

	<TEXT> So for the past week I haven't gone above 500 calories. My average I'd say is around 350. I'm losing at a really really slow rate. Since Sunday I'm down 1.6 pounds. About a month ago I was eating 400-650 calories and I was losing 3+ pounds per week. 

I'm weighing things that need to be weighed and logging every single calorie. I don't understand. Has anyone experienced this? Is it because I weigh (slightly) less now, the weight loss is slowing down? I'm not eating high sodium either, besides the cup of soup I had on Monday (which I realized was a huge mistake and I'm no longer consuming soup). 

I only lost 0.2 pounds since yesterday (usually it's 0.4-0.6 per day) so I'm only consuming liquids today (still counting the calories, 300 calories worth of liquids today and that's it). Hopefully I see a great loss on the scale tomorrow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Their nutrition information is listed [here](https://www.outback.com/nutrition). You can build your meal and it shows you the calories. I did a quick meal builder and looks like you can get their Chicken on the Barbie with a side of asparagus and a side salad (the entree comes with 2 sides) and your meal will be under 500 calories. Get the BBQ sauce on the side and I'd imagine it'll be even less. They also have an entire 'Under 600' section you should look at. 

Really, any grilled meat with sauces on the side + a veggie side dish would be safe.  </TEXT>

Lunch: Protein shake (150)

Dinner: Protein shake (150)

Total: 300

The scale was up 0.4 pounds this morning and I'm not sure why. None of my food from yesterday had a lot of sodium even. I'm just drinking protein shakes today to see if that'll help move the number on the scale tomorrow. 

Edit: Just weighed myself again. I'm actually down 0.2 pounds since yesterday. I'm still going to stick to liquids today to see if I can get a greater loss by tomorrow.  </TEXT>

I've been off it for a little over a year now since I'm not sleeping with any men, though I've been thinking about getting back on it to help ease my periods. Though I didn't have any weight related side effects when I first started it, I do worry about the possibility of weight gain/water retention/increased appetite. 

I've been kind of depressed lately and I've been thinking about asking my doctor to put me on Prozac again. I didn't experience any weight related issues in the past with it but I still have a fear something might go wrong. </TEXT>

Obviously I'm by no means *thin* but I'm thinner (does that make sense even??). I don't think I felt this "thin" until I was 105ish as a teen. The only difference between now and then is that now I'm an athlete (riding horses and all that shit) so is it possible I have more muscle/less fat now compared to when I was a teenager? I was totally sedentary as a teenager besides PE twice a week. Or is my mind/body dysmorphia just playing tricks on me? I've gotten much bonier since losing the last 2-4 pounds and I seriously don't recall being this bony when I weighed the same as a kid.  </TEXT>

If you want to lose weight and think it'll make you happy, that's fine, go for it! But a therapist will be able to help you figure out why you feel such a strong desire to go to an extreme and attain a horrible disease like anorexia. Once you work with your therapist to identify this, you and the therapist will come up with a way to get you out of that mindset and give you tools to work towards healthy weight loss.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't mean this to be rude or condescending or belittling or invalidating in any way but do you have a therapist? What you're going through is clearly causing you a lot of pain (I struggled with self harm a LOT as a teenager, half a decade later my left arm is still completely fucked up). Also, desiring another mental illness is...a whole other issue. 

I don't know how many posts you've read on this sub but majority of people with eating disorders are suffering. I, for one, feel fatter and fatter as the scale drops. It's a total mindfuck but I at least can identify that there are deeper issues within myself besides simply wanting to be thin. If I could just eat healthy and exercise to get thin, I would. Hell, I've tried it! I was recovered for a while, gained a bit of weight and tried to lose weight the healthy way. I even had a goal weight in the healthy range! But my eating disorder got triggered and...I've relapsed. I don't enjoy starving myself. I don't enjoy feeling sick, tired, weak, braindead. I don't enjoy isolating myself from my friends and family out of fear of food. I LOVE my friends and family and I miss them dearly. But eating disorders are all consuming and forbid me from seeing them. 

I love food and I miss food but I literally cannot get myself to eat even 10 calories more than I planned on without feeling like crying, without feeling like a failure. Please do not wish you had anorexia or any eating disorder. Every waking moment feels like I'm burning in hell. Please do not aspire to be this way, it's not glamorous or beautiful.
