	<TEXT> While this is prior to the official surrender of the Japanese in the Philippines (in August) and the official independence of the Philippines (July 1946), it probably commemorates when the Japanese were forced out.  As someone whose grandfather died in the combat to force the Japanese out of the Philippines, I think it's a nice historical item.  Note this is stamped in Cebu, which is one of the larger cities in the central islands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a nice looking design.  I am curious - I see a receiver and a turntable, but I don't see any speakers.  Where are the speakers? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Polarizing filters would have ruined this shot as they would have (depending on alignment) eliminated the reflection of the clouds in the water.  However, polarizing filters can be helpful in adjusting the contrast between clouds and sky.  Flares are eliminated by shading the lens from the sun - on an SLR that would be done with a lens hood, on a phone camera one could simply hold out their hand to cast a shadow over the lens.  To balance out exposure on landscape scenes like this, the best approach is often to use a neutral density gradient filter to lower the light intensity for the sky to better match the foreground.  And/or, taking pictures RAW and selective adjustment afterward. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like a smudge stick (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smudge_stick) that has been made up in the kachina style.  That's pretty fancy for a smudge stick.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see both approaches in cover letters I review and for me, it makes no difference which you use.  What is most important, IMO, is that the cover letter be tailored to the position.  If you say nothing about why you're interested in this particular job, then it shows you didn't have enough interest in it to update a couple of sentences before you applied.  There will always be applicants who are specifically interested in the position and those will rise to the top of the pile.  

I can't speak to full-time recruiter practices as others have, but as a hiring manager, I review every cover letter and resume from every applicant for my positions. </TEXT>
