Familiar ako sa Atoms for Peace and Thom's solo gig. I'll give it a listen.

	<TEXT> Well I've been listening to Radiohead for almost three years now but I haven't gone through to their entire discography. *Amnesiac*, *Hail to the Thief*, and *Pablo Honey* (I only like one song from it. Make one good guess ano yun haha) nalang di ko pa napapakinggan ng buo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it depends on your music taste. Their albums vary in genre which is great I guess. If you want some feel good pop rock songs, go with their *The Bends* album. *OK Computer* and *Kid A* for melancholy. But if you just want some chill love songs, I highly recommend their *In Rainbows* album.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> God I wouldn't even call it a meme. It's just another dumb gimmick people are doing on social media. So anyway, it started I think with a student from TUP posing on a mountain during his "vacant". The early gimmicks looked amusing and believable at first but things got out of hand when other schools started overdoing it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. The main title was actually made by the guys who did GoT's and Westworld's as well.  
Sadly, no. I don't think Starz is available in the country but I'm sure some channel will carry show locally. I would suggest *sailing the high seas* nalang if you know what I mean. </TEXT>
