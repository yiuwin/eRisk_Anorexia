	<TEXT> Opiate: Jerk-Off. I ususlly don't like really angry music, but this one has some of the best guitar I've ever heard in a song.

Undertow: 4 Degrees. I can't for the life of me understand why this song isn't more popular. The vocals are so eerie and suck you in. I think it is a great, grimey song that is a great example of what the album is all about.

nima: H. This song really makes me emotional, though I can't pinpoint why. I think it has many interpretations; in my case, it has to do with my depression and eating disorder. Very powerful, and never gets repetitive.

Lateralus: Triad. Just a great song to zone out to. Used when I want to be in my own little world for a few minutes.

10,000 Days: The Pot. I LOVE songs about hypocrisy. This is the anthem to calling people out.

	<TEXT> Honestly, I saw this comment after reading some fan comments on a forum. I am a huge fan of Tool, but don't use any mild-altering drugs. It's very annoying to have other Tool enthusiasts tell me I "wouldn't understand" the underlying meaning of a song because I have never taken LSD/shrooms/etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favorite primer is colourpop's own primer, it's very nice and clings onto the color (in a good way). I can't wear the liquid ones though...my lip cracks like the ground during an earthquake. The matte solid lipsticks are much better IMO, although they arent transfer-proof. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny, I usually see blending as my major weakness. I have an extra fold of skin that gives the illusion of 2 eyelid creases, which may contribute to it usually looking unblended (can't see the gradient). That's why I usually take pictures with my eyebrows slightly raised... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the blush placement, very natural! I love the eye color, but I agree that the inner corner highlight is a bit too strong. I would also suggest going softer on the nose contour, or at least blending more...I can see the "line," if that makes sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel torn about this. I was born in 1998, so have never been able to see Tool in concert. As Undertow is possibly my favorite album of all time, I'd love to see them play Intolerance or Flood. 

That being said, an artist shouldn't regress back into those negative thoughts if they find doing so unhelpful. It is the members' (specifically Maynard's) decision; he doesn't owe us fans. So while it's sad to realize I'll never hear Jerk-Off live, I look forward to hopefully hearing other amazing, more positive songs. There are so many to choose from! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I called HR to check what times it said I was available. Originally (on the website application) I put availibility as 7:30-9:30. When I went to the 2nd interview I said I forgot I had practice and gave a much more limited schedule.  The interviewer wrote it down but I guess it was never changed on the official system. So the manager has one set of info while the databate has another! It's very confusing and stressful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello /r/Target! About a month gfo, I applied for cashier at my local Target. I was called for an interview almost immediately. After the first, I was promptly asked to go in for a second. Sadly, this is where I feel I made my mistake.
As I was in track and school during that time, my flexibility was...pretty bad 5:30-10 on school days). I was not given the job ultimately. Though no reason was given, I have a feeling that was why.
Now track is over, summer break is a few weeks away (June 5th), and my schedule is MUCH more open. My friend who works there says the store is low on cashiers and I should reapply. Is this allowed or a good idea? I've wanted to work there for a long time!

Many thanks for reading and responding! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hello, first time posting at /r/anxiety !

i have been in sports for my entire life, mostly soccer. i found i enjoy more individual activities, such as swimming and running. unfortunately, i hate competing. as in, i dropped out of my swim team when i was doing well because i hated the pressure.
this year, i have joined track for the second year. i've never been particularly athletic (although i'm not the absolute worst), but i enjoy running long distance. my coach keeps telling me to compete, but i continue to make excuses on why i can't. i want to be honest and tell him i have severe anxiety disorder and can't sleep for days on end when i know a meet is coming up. 
does anyone know of a way i could approach my coach? i don't want if to come off as me being a slacker...i love training and work hard every day, but races ruin the fun completely.
