	<TEXT> This is worded wonderfully. Shit happens. I'm trying to roll with it. Doctors, hospitals, labs, MRIs, spinal taps. As longs as there's an answer, it's all good. It's no one's fault. You put that into words very well. This is something I think we all need to think about sometimes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is beautiful and made me smile. It sounds like you've made so much progress and are really enjoying life. It sounds like your kids have a fantastic mother. Good on you for getting out of that relationship and even better that you are doing what YOU want. What you're doing sounds fantastic. Can I come over? :-)

I am currently in the same boat you were as a child. Books are great escapism tools. You've given me hope that I can still have a 'childhood' later in life. I'm just barely an adult right now, but I feel 60. One day, I will go on an adventure. And I will think of you. Thank you for this response.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was watching Tarzan and suddenly got really upset. sure, I watched Disney movies as a kid. but I never got to act like a kid. I was always doing something wrong or "acting like a child". that's the point! I was a child! I was supposed to act as such. I don't know. the movie triggered a lot of emotions. Carla taking care of Tarzan. Kerchac not accepting Tarzan. i feel ridiculous envying a cartoon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this is terrifying. I'm so sorry that your boss is blaming you. it's absurd. i has anxiety just reading this. on Monday, could you talk to HR? if your boss is brushing thus under the rug, this could potentially happen to someone else. 

I'm sorry your Nmom hijacked that phone call. if you need to talk, we're all here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ndad said this gem the other day. I said that if I'd gone to uni out of town I could have moved out, but I can still move in with someone since I'll be going to uni in town. 

"Since you're in town, you will not be leaving this house."

N logic. it baffles me </TEXT>
