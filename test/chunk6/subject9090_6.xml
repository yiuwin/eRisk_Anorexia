	<TEXT> There is the moral of all human tales;

'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past.
First freedom and then Glory  when that fails,
Wealth, vice, corruption  barbarism at last.
And History, with all her volumes vast,
Hath but one page...
Byron
I think Thomas Cole was inspired from this passage from Childe Harold's Pilgrimage! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for such a detailed and comprehensive answer ( unfortunately I don't have these presentations with me ) but I'll give a try to Prezi .I think they had advanced motion graphics ( which in my digital naivety,I attributed to Power Point ) and  must be professionally made ( they were about urban development,municipal facilities etc ) </TEXT>
