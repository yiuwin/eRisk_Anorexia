	<TEXT> I don't understand how you can't understand that a huge portion of Nashville MLS fans would come from small towns and cities outside of the metro area.  That's how it is in the south with every pro team, including MLS (see Atlanta United).  San Diego doesn't have a huge population to pull fans from like that because for the 1,000 time it's hemmed in on 2 sides by 2 large cities.  There isn't a large area full of small towns and cities that San Diego is the principal city for.  No other city in MLS suffers from this except San Diego.  It's a geographic anomaly, and unfortunately for San Diego it limits the amount of fans they could have 

The area that Nashville draws from is much larger than the San Diego metro area.  Middle Tennessee + north Alabama + east TN + west TN is far more people than San Diego.  You can't say "oh but if you count people in LA it's more" because people in LA live and care about LA, not San Diego.  That would be like saying, "People in Nashville are going to be Atlanta United fans even if Nashville got a MLS team."  If San Diego wasn't crammed between 2 larger cities San Diego would have a larger area but they are so it's a mute point.  

It's simple  </TEXT>

Orange County is in LA's metro area and the large majority of fans would be LA since it's closer and it's culturally and economically tied to LA a lot more than San Diego.   </TEXT>

The Nashville metro area doesn't take into account that the rest of the state of Tennessee would support the team as well, just like the predators and Titans.  San Diego doesn't have a large area of influence like that because it's hemmed in on one side by LA's metro area and Tijuana on the other side.  

Middle Tennessee alone has nearly the same population as the San Diego metro area, and that's only counting 1/3 of the state  </TEXT>

Cities with rabid fanbases don't get their teams relocated, period.  The raiders, Rams, and chargers all had piss poor fans that rarely sold out games/or had butts in seats and had horrendous stadium situations.  You won't see the Seahawks, chiefs, and most of the other NFL teams moving anytime soon because they actually have great fans that go to games.  Not apathetic ones like in San Diego

	<TEXT> I actually kind of like this.  In America there are a lot of really smart people that end up being in tons of debt because of college, because their families made too much money to get FASFA and other grants.  While there are people from poor families that are terrible students that get nearly 100% full government assistance.  

For example my roommate has his college 100% paid for by the government even though his ACT test score was around a 19 and his current GPA in college is a 2.5.  I got a 26 on the ACT and currently have a 4.0 GPA in college but pay for about 85% of tuition because my family didn't qualify for government assistance  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think MLS suffers from the same thing MLB does.  In the cities where MLS/MLB are popular it's a huge deal.  They are soccer/baseball cities.  However outdide of those markets literally nobody cares.  Nobody outside of the metropolitan areas like Portland, Seattle, etc cares about MLS.  To be fair only the NFL and NBA have popularity outside of metropolitan areas.  For instance go to rural Texas and you'll still find NFL   NBA fans, but hardly any MLB or MLS fans.  Idk how you fix that but I think there are a lot of snobby MLS fans that don't care what people outside of major metro areas care.  That's over half of the American population that MLS has zero penetration into, and honestly it seems like MLS doesn't care.  As long as they don't care about that demographic they will be third, fourth, or fifth fiddle in America sports  </TEXT>
