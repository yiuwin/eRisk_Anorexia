	<TEXT> I had PANDAS as a child which resulted in me having OCD. PANDAS occurs when you have strept throat and your antibodies attack your brain rather than the infection. Fast forward a couple of years after recovery and an anxiety attack after being attacked that led me to anorexia. It was the only thing I could control in my life and I fucking loved it. I was like a high-schooler abusing Adderall, but instead I was reveling in the control I had and the focus. After about a year I woke up and realized I was hurting my family...
Then I started binging. I went from the control I had to chaos, so I started purging.

I've been to so many therapist and taken so many medications that I can't even count and nothing has worked. Binging, purging, and restricting have all been coping mechanisms for me. I've been able to find other ways of helping myself but I still find myself going back to these urges when I've had anxiety attacks.

It rules my life and I hate it. I feel like the only cure would be for me to get away from my past. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I knew a couple who, after seven years of dating, divorced in less than a month after marriage.
Turns out there wasn't a guy in the picture, just another woman. </TEXT>
