	<TEXT> I can't offer any code example or the like, but I would look at having a system like:

- User A loads page, joins websocket pool
- User B updates $foo
- Server receives $foo, validates it   transmits new value over socket
- Server saves $foo in background (maybe on a timer?)

That way you're not hammering your database. You could even have the node (or whatever) server serving your sockets only save every X seconds to the DB, which would mean no matter how many users are on the socket setting data your database load never really increases, keeping the load on the socket server where it should be. </TEXT>

Focus on composition. Ever listen to some top 40 'backing tracks' and thought "wow, that's really simple, I could've made that" well that's because it's true, you probably can make those sounds, but can you compose that song? I know I can't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, you shouldn't have your 'staging' server on your production server. There's a number of reasons for this and I'm sure you can guess most of them. So let's look past that for now. You could check if a .env variable is set before running your tasks.

    if(env('run_jobs') != true){exit;}

Then set that on your production sites .env file.

I love using the .env file for stuff like this!

	<TEXT> I remember a story from a few years ago.

A work mate of mine was rushed to finish a project full of legacy code. His job was to add our systems to their very old PHP app and in his credit he managed to do it without (much) breaking.

However, there was one error message thrown by their legacy code, from what I remember it was to do with namespacing and their primitive "autoloader" and actually didn't effect anything from working. 

There was just no way to get ride of this error, the code didn't use exceptions, status codes, nothing. The error was returned the same way as the successful data (plain text) and there was simply no time to refactor even a portion of their legacy app.

The solution was, at the 11th hour on a Friday night, to cover the error which traipsed the bottom of the application with a giant white box.

The client was ecstatic, no other agency had managed to get rid of that error.

I am not too sure where I'm going with this...but I guess the hack here is, cover up your shit code with white divs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey man, hopefully I can help you out here!

I listened to the track and while there's a lot of effects on the vocal and there's not really an isolated point to grab a sample from I think what you're after is what's referred to as a *female vocalist*

A good strategy for getting this kind of vocal is to get in touch with a  **girl** who can, at least somewhat, hold a note.

From there you're going to have to use all your skills to convince them you don't make trash music and that you're worth their time recording some vocals for you.

Don't forget, these pesky *vocalists* will probably expect some kind of compensation for their work (I know wtf?) which would probably come in the form of a license, or possibly a writing and royalty credit.

Places to find **females** who can potentially give you vocals are:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Soundcloud
- Tinder
- OK Cupid

Give it a go, let me know if you find any of these **feamle vocalists** </TEXT>

Here's my custom function from my util system. This wont work under all host setups, but has proven pretty reliable.

Top of your function you need

    ob_implicit_flush(true);

And here's the function you can send your message (output) to each time you want it to echo. Change the uSleep() time to have it wait longer before processing the next message (can be set to 0 if you want)

    function bSend($message)
    {
        echo $message."br/";
        echo str_pad('',4096)."\n";

	<TITLE> Multi-Tenant Design in Laravel </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-01 12:16:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, looking for peoples opinions on different ways of approaching a multi-tenant design for a Sass Application.

I've been looking at this package - https://github.com/HipsterJazzbo/Landlord

However it seems like (I haven't had a huge look through the codebase) this just helps you out by scoping your queries to a particular relationship.

My biggest concern is the obvious, huge tables. For example I would have a 'keywords' table that clients would have 1000+ entries in. With 1000 clients that's a million row table...

From my understanding, I could setup Foreign Keys on everything that relates to the 'mother' table of clients. But would that index well enough to keep query times low?

My original idea  was to create a database per client. Obviously this would solve any potential large table issues, but would I run into other problems having 1000+ databases on my sql server?

Interested to hear what you guys think would be best.

	<TEXT> It's probably way too resource intensive to have your server 'watch' and record the video. Instead, you could pass this responsibility to the browser and have them send back the video (or frames) to the server.

I have no decent suggestions on how to do this reliably, but my first path would be html5 canvas since it's quite straight forward to dump frames from a canvas. You might find your server still needs to turn the frames into a video - as I'm pretty sure you can't export frames as an encoded video in html5. </TEXT>

So there's a simple script that submits a 'correct' answer (potential) and decreases their counter... I've found it easy to fire 1000 requests at it at once (but have restrained myself so far). 

It says something magical will happen at 1000, should I spam it?

EDIT: I'm too scared to do it from work. You can setup a post request to push {answer: 'potential', enterBtn: 'enter'} and it will register. Other option is to enter 'potential' submit the form, then refresh (and redsend data). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ummm, languages don't create vulnerabilities. Programmers do.

Of course languages with lower barriers to entry will have more vulnerable sites, there's more incompetent people building with them!

The fact that there's plenty of PHP sites without XSS or SQL vulnerabilities is proof the problem isn't with the language itself but rather the programmers education. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, you can try printing CD's and finding a record store that will sell them or try get a publisher / distributor side of a label involved. But to be honest if you're going to find one of those who are interested you're probably already doing great online.

Or, alternately you admit that both you and I are '20 something shoegazers' who's biggest audience is online and put your music where the people are. Maybe Bandcamp isn't the best for your genre (or maybe it is, i dunno) but to say 'digital distribution is saturated' is ridiculous. It's accessible to all, sure, but good music shines through no problem.

If you truly feel your music is joining a 'saturated' online collection, you should probably start making some different music. Because there's never an over saturation of good music.

Sorry if this sounds harsh, but digital distribution is your only real option. For good reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't looked at any packages to help with this, but the general principle would be.

1. Import users with their WP passwords

2. Take the WP password function and set it up somewhere in your app to validate WP passwords

3. Add a check to your login that recognizes a WP password (the first few chars are probably indicative that it's a WP password or not)

4. If it validates, run the plaintext password through Hash:: and store it in the database, replacing the WP one.

That way, the user won't notice anything at all :) </TEXT>
