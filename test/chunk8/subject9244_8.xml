What's the deal with people on Reddit always asking anonymous strangers on Reddit why they should watch a show, or which shows they should watch? There's an entire TV criticism industry dedicated to doing that, better than any anonymous stranger would be able to. There are Wikipedia pages outlining what a show is about, if you're *actually* curious.

If I enjoy a show, why would it by my duty to sell someone else on it? Art is personal. **Watch the fucking thing; see if you like it.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The show knows it's ridiculous. It leans into it. That Giamatti "seed" monologue is a perfect example, and what I love about the show.

I really doubt anyone has ever talked like that.

This oft-cited critique has always irked me. I couldn't care less about verisimilitude as a hard-and-fast rule, especially with regard to style of dialogue. This is fiction, not a documentary. No one talks like David-Milch-in-*Deadwood*- or Sorkin- or Amy Sherman-Palladino-written dialogue. edit: typo, clarity </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Levy initially posted an Instagram story Wednesday, using a picture where he is in a full-length knee brace and on crutches and captioning it "'your knee is fine,' they said."

"Still had the same issues emerge in March as from December/January," Levy said in an email to ESPN. "Turns out there was a little more damage than I was being told and there's no way I should've been back on the field last year." 

In March, he said "hell no, I wasn't even close" to being fully healthy when he returned to the field. ([ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/19093011/former-lions-lb-deandre-levy-another-knee-surgery-following-torn-meniscus))

	<TEXT>  **It underlines the value of HBOs linear-centric model.**

Given Netflixs track record for giving talent plenty of creative freedom, as well as for nurturing positive publicity for its best shows, theres little doubt BLL wouldve emerged a success had it ended up on streaming. But whats less clear is whether or not BLL would have delivered the same emotional and cultural wallop had all the episodes dropped at once, sandwiched between some new Marvel show and another season of Grace and Frankie. Theres a case to be made that having this story play out over the course of two months allowed viewers the time to savor and appreciate each installment, even as positive word-of-mouth among early adopters helped the shows overall audience expand.

Nielsen numbers certainly suggest BLL built momentum during its run. The shows February 19 premiere brought in a solid 1.1 million same-day viewers; Sundays finale scored just under 2 million. This doesnt mean the series doubled its overall audience from start to finish, but the fact that its linear audience grew almost every week it aired indicates buzz about BLL broke through and helped recruit new fans. This happens with Netflix shows, to a degree: Stranger Things stans on social media wouldnt shut up about the show last summer, a fact with no doubt contributed to the impression (not corroborated by data, since Netflix releases none) that the show was a smash. But a linear run on an old-school network such as HBO amplifies and concentrates that buzz in a way the Netflix model doesnt allow.

Entertainment-centric websites such as Vulture spent the week leading up to Sundays finale speculating about how the show would end and testifying to its virtues. Social media similarly lit up during and immediately after the finale, publicizing the now-complete limited series to millions of potential new viewers (and possible new HBO subscribers). Top Netflix and Amazon shows also get plenty of publicity and hype, but the attention comes in shorter bursts and fades more quickly. By sticking to a linear model, HBO maximizes the attention it gets for its best series. Plus, thanks to the companion digital platforms such as HBO Go and HBO Now, the network can still satisfy the Netflix generation by letting subscribers who want to the opportunity to binge all seven episodes. Bottom line: The networks model gives it the best of both worlds. You can bet the next time a talent agency is shopping a star-studded project to various outlets, HBO will cite BLL as a reason why said project should end up on cable and not streaming.

I think that's a great point. I'm glad it wasn't dumped all at once on Netflix. The communal popularity of this show was one of its more exciting aspects to me; fewer and fewer shows are experiencing that specific week-to-week, consistent mass engagement these days. edit: clarity </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, it's not. That's a poor comparison. I'm struggling to come up with a good one at the moment, and it's hard, but *Entourage* is far from whatever the right answer is. There is definitely a strong lifestyle porn element to the show, but that's a whole lot of shows.

Watch a trailer for it to get a sense, or check the wikipedia page. It's good, and more importantly, super fun, which is an underrated quality these days in TV IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone said that's too close to vagina for that shot on *The Americans* considering their cable TV home, and you said, *Lol, they can do whatever they want, as their cable peers have before*. The problem is, The Americans is on basic cable, not premium, and if there has been any significant precedent for full frontal, let alone a nipple, on basic cable, I'm not aware. Hence me asking. Basic and premium operate on different playing fields, as I'm sure you know -- largely a function of advertising. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But then it illustrates it with **Game of Thrones, which generally does a great job of making each episode compelling** even when there's not much to distinguish where one episode ends and another begins

Downvote away, Reddit, but I gotta disagree big-time here. The middle of GOT seasons tend to get *very* slow for me. They become series of checkings-in, or vignettes of various characters around the larger universe without any real episodic payoff or overarching theme, because those are meant to come towards the end of the season. Like the author of this article is saying, I don't think you need to forgo the episode as a unit (in lieu of a bunch of disparate scenes), for the season as a whole. You can have both. </TEXT>
