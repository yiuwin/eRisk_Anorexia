	<TEXT> At our high school there was some guy who would shit and then make pictures on the stalls, with said shit. 
We called him poocasso. He was never caught and he did this every couple of months for all four years.
Someone one come running into class yelling "poocasso has struck again! Poocasso is back!" 
I had the theory that it was one of the janitors, knowing he would never be caught. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are great, especially after I finished the show and got to watch it again with a stronger connection to the characters.

	<TEXT> I honestly think watching the whole show a second time through made me love the show so much more because for a large part of the 1st and second seasons you don't really know the characters very well yet and a lot of the jokes are less funny because you don't have a connection with the characters. 
But on the other hand, the comedy in the show is very quirky and weird. 
It doesn't translate well to a lot of people, but resonates very strongly and is very relatable to weird quirky people, like me. 
All in all, the writing is fantastic, the comedic timing is spot on, and the characters are very lovable and relatable, in my opinion at least.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Soooo you're saying I can read and comprehend, because you're right about nothing? 
You're kind of creating holes for yourself 
And just so you know you were the one that started this whole thing by saying the joke wasn't funny when that clearly had nothing to do with all the down votes. 
People don't down vote comments that aren't funny, they just skip over them. 
People down vote things that offend them. 
That's why I defended my political views. 
Not just to you but to EVERYONE. Because this is the Internet and other people than you will see my comment. 
Now about the whole thinking you were op, you are right... I did. I was wrong. Whoops. Doesn't really matter as far as the rest of my point went. 
I didn't know you weren't American because THERE WASN'T ANY FUCKING EVIDENCE TO PROVE OTHERWISE, and if I could influence one person's opinion to not vote for trump I would do it all over again bitch. 
So fuck off. 
This is the last comment that I will actually reply seriously to you 
Expect pictures of big black dicks if you respond again. 
Have a great fucking day you ignorant piece of shit wrapped in a tampon. 
Bye  </TEXT>

Would you try to defend it? 
Or would you sit there and do nothing about it because you don't want to waste your time?

I replied to you, but everyone is going to see it so... Not just to you. 
And by the way, how can you think my comment is a waste of time if you didn't even read it all? 
That seems like a contradiction... 
If you didn't read it then how is it a waste of time? 
Also it's a bit arrogant to think my views are bullshit and a waste of time when you don't live in America, and they don't matter to you. I'm sorry I couldn't see you weren't from here I obviously missed the giant IM NOT FROM AMERICA sign next to your username. 
Now can you fuck off please since I'm apparently wasting your time?

	<TEXT> I think his joke was funny and made sense 
Your sign said racist things... Trump says racist things. 
So the joke is viable. Now you just seem like you're embarrassed about the racist thing you posted and the fact that you support trump (anybody who doesn't support trump would have thought that was as funny as I did) and you should be ashamed. 
We don't live before the civil war. Everyone was created equally and if you don't believe it, think about if you were born black or Muslim. 
Is that your fault? 
Would your emotions and feelings matter less just because your skin is a different color? 
How would you feel if you spent your life trying to be a good citizen, and some rich dude said that you and all your family were terrorists and suddenly everyone you knew hated you and wanted to kill you, not because you did anything to spite them, but because your skin is different, and someone said so?
Think about all of that before you vote trump into office and make America awful again. Asshole. </TEXT>
