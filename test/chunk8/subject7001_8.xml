	<TEXT> Sorry for the really nooby question but I have a 3ds on 11.3 with games like Pokemon and fire emblem on the sd card. I recently bought another 3ds for really cheap at 11.2. If I system transferred from my old one to the new one, would my saves in Pokemon and fire emblem be transferred over as well? (Idk if this is relevant but I only have 1 32 gig as card that is currently in my old 3ds) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently found my old unhacked o3ds and updated it to 11.3-36U on accident. I found a video guide on YouTube showing how to homebrew it, but nothing on the 3ds.guide. People often laugh at video tutorials for bricking their systems, just came to ask if I should do it or not </TEXT>
