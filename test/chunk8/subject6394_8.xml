	<TEXT> No one said a mind shouldn't wander from time to time, or even not question **why** they should focus on the activity at hand. OP is bothered by the fact they can't knock out a 20-page reading assignment, which obviously limits what they're trying to achieve. 

A more accurate analogy would be an in-shape person doing squats when they're supposed to be doing push-ups. That's what OP is describing. 

Okay, does OP have access to audio of the text? Do they read better on a treadmill? The ends justify the means here, and if OP knows an alternative way to concentrate, they should do that. 

But it's worth noting that with some goals, being able to stay focused on dense texts or more "boring" stimuli is a must. 

From your response it seems like my post has struck a personal nerve, and you need to work off some steam. Read 20 pages and get back to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meditate. Read more. Stay absorbed in one activity for longer periods of time until it gets easier. 

It's the same as physical exercise. Every time you're doing something like that, you're doing mental push-ups.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your attention span is weak. Start training it back up.

You're telling us you can't read 20 pages without your mind wandering. That's like an out-of-shape person being unable to do 20 push-ups. You are mentally weak.

	<TEXT> It can be a difficult launching-off point. Friends/girlfriends have said it took months before they felt like I didn't hate them. Which has actually kind of made me insecure/worried about how many opportunities for connection I've passed up. 

The best advice I can give is to keep trying, and be receptive when one tries to reciprocate and reach out to you. Overcoming a person's walls is probably more your comfort zone than theirs. 

Some of us can be pretty hypersensitive to rejection, and a seemingly small or accidental rebuff early-on might convince an INTJ to give up right away  especially if you two don't know each other well. I know that for me, a large worry is losing sight of my goals or self-discipline to be vulnerable for someone and get shot down. If someone gets into my head, I don't want my productivity  and yeah, also my pride  to suffer. 

We have more in common with you than you might realize. We're not enigmatic geniuses; we just get too comfortable in our shells. We get excited over television shows, enjoy breaking our boring routines for new things, laughing at funny videos on the internet, joking around with you, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Car rental agent. Spilled grape jelly inside one of the cars, and when a customer complained I tried to blame it on them instead. 

I ended up getting fired a few months later for unrelated reasons.  </TEXT>
