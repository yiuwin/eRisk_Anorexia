	<TEXT> If the employer does that then you can request a payout from your PTO balance, that eliminates the employer's motivation to cheat the workers. The amount of money they'd get in the 30 days they have to actually make the payout, plus the fact that word would spread and employees would start choosing OT instead of comp time, would defeat the purpose of trying to cheat employees out of it. </TEXT>

The puzzling conceit of Brits and Canadians to drop the article "a/the" makes the statement unclear. Did you go to a university for schooling or did you go to multiple universities and that's just your way of saying you graduated from one of them?

	<TEXT>  low-wage workers are actually empowered to fight their employers on wage theft.
 
A world with both state and federal agencies that exist solely to empower workers to fight their employers on wage theft and other workplace issues.   

I've personally witnessed it...    

And yet apparently you didn't report it. Also, you are de facto assuming every employer will cheat their employees, which is just unsupportable logic. Again I'll point to the fact that the largest employer, the US federal government, has been running this successfully for years now. It still speak to arrogance, since I can't find any other reasonable word for it, that you think your experience should/will dictate everyone else's experience.   

That being said, I will say again, and I'll bold it and capitalize it for emphasis, this is **ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY ON THE PART OF THE EMPLOYEE**. To put it in simple words, if you want to get your 1.5x as OT, then you're going to continue to be free to, but otherwise your logic is... illogical.

	<TEXT> Except they aren't empowered to force people. Your, and others here, collective conspiracy theories about employers stealing wages and threatening workers aside, this has worked for the federal government for a long time, and both this bill and federal and state labor laws have stringent protections for workers. Some states are better than others, admittedly, but there are plenty of remedies for workers and some speculative harm is a ridiculous reason that this shouldn't go through. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply. I don't disagree, but at the same time I wonder if there's a way to tell the story of Adams, or a story of the Jesuits (which in itself would be amazing, even if it covered their whole expansion and not just Japan) without the connotation of white intervention.   

Your comment, along with your other comments to this post, made me think of *The White Man's Burden* by Kipling, which along with his other works is, in retrospect, an unfortunate part of Western literary history, since his writings were somewhat similar, although I would argue that Kipling was a bit more blatant about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have it on hand, but doesn't the bill say, "whichever is greater"? That ties into your second point, since it's quite probable that a company would have to pay more if they stop their employees from using the comp time.   

Even if it isn't, the employee can give a written request to their employer and have their comp time paid out within 30 days, at which point they can just use unpaid leave, making it no different than any other leave request. With that being said, what incentive does that give the employer to deny requests just because the employee is requesting to use comp time instead of unpaid leave? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It happens because they don't report it, either because they're ignorant or afraid. Go to your state's DOL website and you'll see both press releases on enforcement and clear guides to confidentially report incidences of wage theft. There are of course plenty of anecdotal stories of wage theft, but how often do you hear someone say that they reported it to the state and nothing came of it, never.   

Also, claiming that the **potential** for wage theft should stop an otherwise ok bill is a ridiculously bad argument. The fact that the employers might do something illegal is not and should never be considered a valid argument against action, unless you really want to make the laughable argument that somehow PTO is more vulnerable to wage theft than any other benefit or payment made to employees. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, not really. Even if it is though, that doesn't hurt the employee, since the employee is still getting paid out at the higher of the wage when earned or the wage at payout, so it's no detriment to them.  
   
Arguably they'd get more money if they took the overtime, but for many people they'd just spend it and bank accounts don't pay much in terms of interest, so they really aren't losing out at all. The main thing though is that it is voluntary for the worker (if the employer offers PTO as an option) whether to choose OT or Comp time (PTO), so what business is it of yours if they think that they'd be better off taking the money later rather than now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would argue that it isn't "wholly inauthentic. It was (very loosely) based on historical events at the time. I'm not saying don't deride the accuracy of most of it, but [William Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adams_(sailor)) did in fact land in Japan and become a key advisor to [Tokugawa Ieyasu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu), who was engaged in a struggle with another [Toyotomi Hideyori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyori), which eventually resulted in Tokugawa becoming Shogun.   
Characters were combined, stories were altered, and of course major parts of it, such as the romance are just plain made up, but the major framing story, that of Blackthorne's coming to Japan, and the war between the Daimyo is real with the details changed or fictionalized.   
 nbsp;   
tl;dr: if anyone reads this novel and takes it as actual history, please let me know where I can go to slap you upside the head. It is very loosely based on a real time and history and partially on real events though. </TEXT>

The Catholic Church was very pro-expansion too, and again the novel gets something right in crediting/blaming the Jesuits for both the great colonies and the horrific abuses that occurred during this time. </TEXT>

No, it really isn't. 

that money should be set aside for those who actually do the work, not parasitic, morally bankrupt shareholders.  

Shareholders are entitled, in the actual, not the hyperbolic sense of feeling entitled, to a share of the profit as part owners of the company. Your argument that the owners of the company don't deserve anything for their share of the ownership (even if they are just buying that share from previous shareholders) is nothing short of ludicrous and flies in the face of thousands of years of history and economics.   

Workers deserve a decent wage and benefits for a decent day's work, but to conflate wages, which are essentially a rent paid to a person for the use of their mind and/or body for a given period of time, with ownership makes no sense. </TEXT>

That being said, it needs to be reworked to be viable in the long term, and that is going to mean either a cap as you mentioned, which is very unlikely to ever pass since I and many other Americans will vehemently oppose it on principle, even those of us who aren't rich, or reworking it in other ways, hopefully with the longer term effect of hardening the program against population age distributions (i.e. too many old people, not enough young people). </TEXT>

The only defense Social Security has at this point is that it is (relatively) fair, except for the pay-in cap, and that goes away if you take that away while having a pay-out cap.   
I realize this is an economics sub, so that's a bit off the topic, but Social Security is going to be gone pretty fast if it's turned into just another handout program. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you define automation and who do you trust to define it in legal terms and/or tax it (if you have one agency/government handling definitions and another using those definitions to enforce the tax)?    

In a perfect world that might work, but not only has the horse already left the barn with jobs already having been semi-automated out for decades (a good example being automobile manufacturing), but it's an impossible problem.   
The problem of automation comes down to humans not only being expensive, but also inefficient. Even if you get expense out of the way, humans are still always going to be less efficient than automated processes (in the long term at least). Trying to tax automation just introduces an artificial inefficiency to the process of reducing labor costs and increasing efficiency which is why, in addition to all the practical issues, it's a bad idea and direct taxation of automation is never going to work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it is, and I really am not going to get down arguing a point that you and I both know we won't agree on, then it isn't an **explicit** harm or call to harm others. IANAL, but even from a moral and ethical standpoint, there's a huge difference between what Coulter and Milo say and explicitly calling for gays, Blacks, Mexicans, Jews, etc... to be rounded up and killed.    
I realize that people here love to hyperbolically say that, "of course, that's what they mean," and of course use the peaceful expulsion (or whatever idiotic language Milo puked up in that speech) as the prime example, but even if he did mean it that way, that's still not an excuse to use violence to silence him.     
Besides all the ethical, moral, and just plain outright societal reasons that violent behavior to discourage unpopular/unwanted speech is harmful, and outright a bad idea both on an individual and societal level, it's counter-productive. Neither he nor Coulter are Hitler, to again make use of another liberal canard, and while they have some popular support, there is really zero risk of them getting the support necessary to bring about the rebirth of actual fascism. In fact, using violence against them actually helps them, since it allows them to paint themselves as oppressed by liberals and helps them bring about support, including from the same right wing thugs that engage in, and as often as not start, fights against liberal protesters.   

The effective response to these people is to speak out against them, refute them, and counter them when they speak publicly. As I said in another comment, the best thing the people at Berkley could have done, is to loudly and vehemently protest her while still letting her speak interrupted, then immediately held a public rally and speech afterwards, with all the press they could muster, to refute everything she said and denounce her. It might not be as flashy as threatening to firebomb the campus if she spoke, but it would be more effective and would have had none of the rebound effect that she is now using to her advantage. She literally would have been able to muster no real response to that, and now she's just getting free press. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And yet both the institution and the students, not to mention outside actors from the city of Berkeley and beyond, are playing right into their hands. This is a win for the conservative groups and for Coulter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do other clubs need to check with the University before inviting a guest to speak to the club? If so, is there a viewpoint neutral standard, that includes being viewpoint neutral in terms of potential backlash/controversy (given that at a school like Berkeley, there will always be more controversy over conservative speakers than liberal speakers)? By which I mean one that doesn't punish conservative speakers for being conservative.    

If all of the above are true then great, otherwise then the principle, if not the law, of free speech are being violated and Coulter is being punished for her viewpoints and the bad behavior of people who oppose her viewpoints. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a difference between not supporting someone's message and violently acting out to prevent them from speaking. Regardless of how abhorrent her message is, and it is truly abhorrent, she has the right to speak without interruption and without the threat that she or her supporters will face violence. Those who oppose her views have every right to peacefully protest and to give their counterpoint/view too, that is the social contract that comes with free speech.      
 
The fact that a few pathetic little worms don't like that and want only speech that they support to be expressed, if not due to legal threats than via violent threats, does not change the fact that she should be allowed to speak. </TEXT>
