	<TEXT> I'd love it if I didn't have to guess if the system registered me pushing the Xbox button, and end up hitting it 4 times only for it to register once...or 4 times 30 seconds later.   It seems the OS is bogging down and loading.  In a world where seconds matter, lets make those seconds count.  Please, Microsoft, lets work on the speed of the OS for a few months.

Edit:
Observations after a day:
seems either one of three opinions.
1) I'm spot on ~70%
2) I'm in the preview program, I should shut up and accept that its slow because of it. ~ 20%
3) Buy a PS4 (which I own and never use, I LOVE my xbox) or make fun of me for asking for 'more stability'

Cont.   I'm really happy with Xbox.  Its got so many features I love, like, and never knew I needed.  And they keep coming (I love it, it proves it is super supported and feels 'alive' and fresh.)  I just want it to be faster/more instant.  In a world where every Iphone is 50% faster, and seconds feel like minutes, I would Personally LOVE optimizations over features at this point (We finally got background music....what more could we want?!). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had the surface pro 2.  I loved it.  Its a bit thicker than the 3 and 4, but its just as fast as the 3...and a little slower than my core m pro 4.  Its worth it, but check swappa...you'll get a better price (thats where i sold mine).  The WORST thing about the 2 is the keyboard.  I SUCKS compared to the 3/4, its what pushed me over the edge to sell it and get the 4.  The trackpad was the worst part.   I LOVE the glass trackpad on the 4.  Technically, you can use the 3/4 keyboard on the 2....but it will slightly stick out past the pro 2's dimentions....and this might be worth the savings to you.

Thats my 2cents.  Enjoy!  Its a sweet machine! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone have an xbox one s and tivo?  I have roamio plus, and while setting it up, it detects its plugged in for like 1 second (not long enough to show anything on the tv) and then acts like there is no signal.  Wasn't sure how the xbox one s handles a non 4k signal from my tivo box.   I've tried setting the xbox to 1080p....i've tried setting tivo output to 720p...still not working. 
I've plugged it directly into my av reciever, and works 100%.  I've plugged my ps4 into my xbox one s hdmi in, and it detects it 100%.  
Not sure what i'm missing.
It worked just fine on my regular xbox one.
