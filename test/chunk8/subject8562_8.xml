	<TEXT> Very cool idea! If I had to give critique, I would use a deeper and darker blue as the base, then add fewer stars and highlights so the ones that are there really pop! Maybe tints of purple? I do like the variety in tones and the little nebula! </TEXT>

You have to be conscious of it and release your energy in another way...I sprint around or scratch an inanimate object or grind my teeth. Yes, I look....crazy, but it's better than self-harm.

I don't do it to hurt myself though, just ends up that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of people are automatically saying the stories are false because she told it through Tumblr. I understand the skepticism, but I don't think that's entirely fair. He has been known to be a drug-addicted, rude, cheating person in the past; of course that is different than rape, but those who say "He's innocent because he's super nice!!" are ignoring this.

That being said, everyone is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. I am not into harrassing either the alleged victim or perpetrator. Leave them be. </TEXT>
