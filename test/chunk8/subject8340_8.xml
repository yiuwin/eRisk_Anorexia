	<TEXT> It's strikes me funny how the 60's kids were the anti-establishment, free love, and never trust the "man", but as an adult, they now love and choke on the tit of power.  Oh how the tables have turned.  The conservative kids are the new hippies like that of the 60's which questions and doesn't rely on the establishment of government for answers. We are now labeled as Fascist buy the ones who hated the government back then, but become the ones that they feared. </TEXT>

Walken: I really liked that he didn't sugarcoat the story to the small boy, there was no interaction. It was a monologue. A monologue is the actors reaction to the story, where as a scene is about an actor reacting to
 other actors.

To me...Baldwin. It's a love/hate; that guy. I hate him, but damn, I love him. I cannot deny purity. </TEXT>

(Please forgive me for I will be using the pronoun "he" as your boss)

He is paying you for a job. I'm assuming you are not the only employee, so he is paying multiple people for a service. He tells you to use his time, only you, and his money to comment on certain subreddits and threads about a certain topic and make comments and thoughts pertaining to such. Why you? Why not him? Does he now know your online reddit name? This has the hint of being a little perverse.

In no way I'm telling you to not do this, but question why from here on out. Sounds a little fishy from someone in power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It looks like a 1940ish Ford sedan. It's been picked heavily. The police used them a "Paddy Wagon" to transport police officers to and from raids. Back then, Paddy was slang for Irish and many police officers were from Irish decent. The less romantic would be a family sedan that was left there after something catastrophic.

One time I asked Scrap if I can have the set list that Mike drawn out and that was on the stage and he gave it to me.  I still have the list of that show he did in Hoboken New Jersey. Some guy named Lippie recordered it and i have ot on CD. He did a couple Soul Coughing songs and then a lot of solo stuff and it was amazing. I still have the set list. This is from that night:

They don't know how to react to the real world and have been taken advantage of for so long. Along come President Trump and plays the elite with bread crumbs and belly up-play dead snakes, leading them down a path where they have no choice but to a must agree or expose the corruption. They all play checkers and he mates them in 4.

	<TEXT> It's weard to me how comfortable a person can be in a foreign country, breaking thier rules and taking thier money without being jailed or killed. My government tought me to take it in the ass and accept what came my way. The house next to me has 15 restaurant servers living in the there which is owned by the restaurant owner. I accept 5 dogs, feral cats that eat out of thier yard, and parties every night. Take it in the ass you American.

Edit: I must be truthfull. I eat at thier restaurant and it is frick'n great. The flipp'n quail!

OK. I don't like the way it's set up though. Bring them through and move on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know we here a T_D do not advocate violence. If Sessions doesn't give the proper authorities the ability to pull these people out and hold them, a defense will happen that will play into the MSM play book. Then we are done. I watched a guy get beat down that included a professor,  until he was down and kicked in the head. It escalated for 3 minutes and the police did nothing until boots to the head.

	<TEXT> In a negotiation, you have to out think your opponent by having at least three contingencies,  a full knowledge of your opponent and past reactions and as in chess, lead them to a corner.  He has done this his whole life. Washington's only defense (or offense really) is *OUTRAGE*! They are a mile behind every move that Trump makes and they don't know what to do but flail. It really shows you how fucked up Washington really was and how they were so easily taken advantage of from the rest of the world.

and now... established repubs want a "Carbon Tax" on us. They still have no idea. Drain the fucking swamp!!! </TEXT>
