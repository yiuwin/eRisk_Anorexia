	<TEXT> I looooove Halloween.
 I've had a party every year for the last 10-12 years. This will be the first year I'm not doing it. My parties used to be 30-40 friends. Last year maybe 12 came and most left around 10:00. 
Most of my friends have babies or just not into it anymore. I moved thirty minutes away. Maybe they just don't want to drive out. ..  either way it's really sad. I have about 5 large bins full of decorations. Pretty much what I spend most of my money on..... Always buy the day after Halloween btw...    

I will still give Halloween candy out and decorate my house outside and front hall.  But this year I wind doing my whole house which is normally what I do....   


Happy Halloween

	<TEXT> I have a few but this one always sticks in my head. 

Might sound stupid but, I've always wanted to see someone and give them a lift when they looked like they clearly needed one. This world is too scary now to trust someone to get into my car.... But there was one time I regretted not offering a ride.
It was a cold rainy night and I was on my way home from work. This wasn't just small drops, it was fucking raining bullets. It was hard to even see out the window. I was finally pulling into my area and almost home. As I turned left onto my main Street. I made eye contact with a mom walking on the sidewalk while carrying her small child wrapped in her arms. No umbrella just fully down pouring on them. I felt so bad I was in my warm dry car and they were outside battling the weather.
I will always regret not offering them a ride to there destination. </TEXT>
