	<TEXT> 1. Yes, but they are too swamped to accommodate my order.  My sales really don't have much to do with their name, they're just one of the sellers that can fit the bill.  I actually want/ed their name off the product from the beginning.
2. Hemp oil is optimal, yes.
3. Yes, for resale.

Thanks for the Q's!  Sorry to not list them specifically, I don't know my soaps too well. ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish this had more upvotes.  Usually, this scares someone off immediately, and if they were innocent (well, you know what I mean), it gives them a chance to take it down, apologize, and realize/admit they've done wrong.  Problem is solved without contacting Etsy.  I agree with the other posts here, that contacting Etsy *is* an option, but perhaps it should be considered as a secondary measure. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Ladies meetup at el Noa Noa, Thurs Sept 4. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-31 20:43:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Alright ladies. Thank you for your feedback on my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/denverwomen/comments/2emrnu/proposed_meetup_dates/).  I've taken your suggestions and decided to schedule our meetup on 9/4/14 at [El Noa Noa](http://www.denvermexicanrestaurants.net/) off Santa Fe.  Credit to [u/deviatednorm](http://www.reddit.com/user/deviatednorm) for the suggestion.  The patio sounds pretty baller.  I will take it upon myself to show up a little early to grab a spot, and I'll bring a makeshift "Denver Women" sign so you know who we are.  See y'all there at 6p.


I'm in a bright orange dress and have blonde (and pink) hair FYI!! Traffic is a bitch atm but should be there very soon! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WTF, no. i don't see why you specifically or anyone else has to sacrifice game time or socializing to play the act of coordinator.  like [u/vericko](http://www.reddit.com/user/vericko) said, there are games. it is obvious. we take up half of every bar we set foot in, and you can show any time between 6-11pm and it's an unfaultering gigantic cluster of people.  people who see this meetup already know that they at least have 2 things in common with the people they are meeting, they like reddit, and they like games.  it's a pretty safe bet that you can at least have a little small talk and either a) you can be introduced to other people or b) you're in the same boat, you're both noobs to the event, and can relate to each other on that level. are we done discussing this yet? </TEXT>

Find a regular (observe how many people they interact with, how they interact, or ASK), and I'm sure he/she will be happy to introduce you to people they know who are there.

	<TEXT> Hey all,

We've had some new members join up recently   I'm back from the summer, so I thought I'd organize a meetup!  I've met some lovely ladies from this sub, and I'd hate to not share the joy of new friends.  Before we get into the nitty gritty (where, time, etc.), I thought I'd propose a couple dates.  Last time we had about 15-20 women show up.

Proposed date #1: Thursday, Sept 4th

Proposed date #2: Tuesday, Sept 9th

Proposed date #3: Friday, Sept 19th


Once we decide on a date, I'll make a stickypost and let it stick on r/denverwomen until the date.  Question the second, would there be any interest in creating a facebook event?  It might harbor our privacy a little bit, but it might be nice to see a few faces   activity before we go.  Let me know your thoughts, questions, concerns!

The night before the event, my cousin happened to have an extra and sold it to a friend of ours for $50. Blah. I would wait last minute and go if you can...if not, check out the smaller, local beer fests as someone else suggested. Summer brews fest last week was great and $35 for tickets at the door. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Languages with the same alphabet are a good place to start.  I have mad respect for those who learn languages with various characters and/or different means of speaking or writing them. A lot more resources are available (at least, in my experience) for Spanish, French, German, etc...I.e. Those languages that are most commonly taught in the US.  Ask yourself, what language would be most useful to you and to which you are most likely to have exposure. :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Plug for r/denver's game night! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-21 16:07:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all,

Haven't posted in a while but felt the need to plug r/denver's game night for this week.  This week is at [Black Sky Brewery](http://www.blackskybrewing.com/) off Santa Fe.  [Here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/rDenverGameNight/) is the facebook group, for those of you that would like to join.

I want to emphasize that you don't need to know how to play any games, or know any people, in order to show up and have a good time.  Everyone is usually pretty friendly and happy to teach new games and meet new folks.  I'll be there (maybe a little later that usual if going to kickball).  I'm the tall chick with blondey/brown hair, ask anyone for Mallory and they'll point you my way.  Feel free to ask questions if there are any (on this thread), usually there's a handful of girls that do show up, myself among them.  It's been a solid meetup for a long time now, and it's a group of great redditors that I really trust and have a good time around.

Lastly, if you're skeptical about the event as a whole and if you'll enjoy yourself, it's easy to bail!  (I know this is a concern of mine when I try new things.)  Don't be discouraged if no one starts up a game within the first few minutes you're there, sometimes folks that just show up have to meander/drink for a few if separate groups have just started a 30 minute game.

Hope to see some new faces on Wednesday! </TEXT>

Any suggestions for a very ingredient-mindful vegan girl to wear?  Thanks for any insight, I don't even know where I'd start, and I'd so much rather buy off a recommendation vs just a google search.

Just be warned--good luck!  In regard to food, anything with high density in calories, if everything's going to be on your back.  Think nuts, chocolate chips, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done softball, basketball, and soccer.  Sports monster is decent..I can't remember what other orgs I've joined at the moment.  Basically, I want something where you're active and it's a *sport*.  Kickball is kind of a joke across the bar, at least in Denver.  It *is* great for meeting new people and socializing, but as someone told me last week, it's smart to keep your expectations in check when you assume you're joining a "sport."  Sorry, I'm still newly bitter.  I hope you find something you like! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None. The answer is none. Unless you like throwing down $80 for a t-shirt, volunteering your time to ref games, having shitty volunteer refs make calls for your game, no slip-n-slides, no cup-in-hand (which they say they are), 5 inning games on 20 person teams in which you bat once and basically only the pitcher "plays" on defense and...well, I could go on.

If I were you, I'd join another sport.  Every other rec sport I've played out here has been a blast. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I came here expecting that tonight we're gonna play games. You know how I know? Because it's Wednesday. And Wednesday night is the night that we usually play games. Monday night is my night to cook. Tuesday night we go and visit your mother, but Wednesday night we play sweet, weekly games. It's when everything is just right. There's nothing good on TV. You haven't had your after-work social sports team practice so you're not too tired. Oh boy...it's all on. You lean in and say something sexy like, "I might cloister in Carcassonne." I know what you're trying to say girl. You're trying to say, "Oh, yeah. It's game night. It's game night." Thanks [u/deviatednorm](http://www.reddit.com/user/deviatednorm) </TEXT>

Took this trip last summer, Denver to Portland, down the coast to San Fran, cut inland to national parks, back out to San Diego, through Joshua tree and Phoenix on the way back. Would absolutely recommend a national parks pass and/or camping if that's your thing. Including gas money it was under $1200 per 2 people (4 went). Feel free to PM me if you'd like more info. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I smashed my face last year when I fell down a mountain.  Thanks to the following, my face is back to the exact same with the exception of a teeny scar.  [Mederma](http://www.amazon.com/Mederma-Cream-SPF-30-Grams/dp/B001PQBELC), a tad expensive due to SPF but worth it cuz it was my goddamn face, [triple antibiotic ointment](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Sense-Strength-Antibiotic-Ointment/dp/B00D2PAXAM) linked here but cheaper when purchased as a generic, and [Cocoa butter with vitamin E](http://www.amazon.com/Butter-Formula-Vitamin-Unisex-Palmers/dp/B001UHSVOY), also available in Walmart/Target places for half the price as listed here.  Basically what you're looking for is lotions with vitamin E.  I've had luck looking in the "ethnic" hair/lotion/body products section, and there's a whole variety of oils and lotions and rubs.  Personally, my favorite is [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Beautiful-Butter-Lotion-Vitamin/dp/B004ZN87X0/) and it's usually $2 in store.  [Bio Oil](http://www.amazon.com/Bio-Oil-PACIFIC357160-Bio-oil-4-2oz/dp/B004AI97MA) can be a bit expensive, but a great and comparable product is Africa's Best Moroccan oil, or generic [Baby Oil](http://www.amazon.com/Johnsons-Baby-Aloe-Vitamin-Ounce/dp/B003NS5P6A).  Again, most of these products are available at Walmart/Target for a fraction of the price.  They're all fairly pricey online because of the weight/shipping prices, despite it being shipped via Prime. </TEXT>

The amount of mistranslated German menu items and beers and descriptions I've seen in breweries lately is too high.  For example, *Very Nice Brewing Co.* in Nederland wrote about their beer "Es is sehr net."  Which, not only is "net," the word for "nice" spelled *nett*, the word is used to describe the personality of a person.  Not a beer.  I'd be happy to help if it would be useful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks!  That's the great thing about being tall - a size 10 looks crazy skinny!  And all the floor model/sample dresses were in that size.  So I got it for a third of the actual price.  I would absolutely recommend poking around at bridal liquidation shows where they have dozens of dresses.  They try to sell all the floor model bridesmaids dresses and it's a complete shot in the dark if you want them all to match (color might be easy to match, just different styles), but you might have a bit of better luck with a wedding dress.  Enjoy the search!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very reasonable.  How I choose a shop when I need supplies is based on availability/variety of items and shipping costs, which all usually fall in the same $4-5 per $20 order.  That being said, as a *seller* I would suggest making the "additional item" cost at least $.25 to cover your listing fees.  As a buyer I wouldn't blink an eye to pay an extra quarter for another item. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who somewhat regularly purchases from stores like these, I think the supplies angle has a lot of potential.  The key with launching this and/or getting a lot of sales, in my opinion as a buyer, would be the variety and number of products offered.  I would choose a shop that had hundreds of types of charms/beads to buy, in order to get combined shipping.  I hope this helps--good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all.  Usually, I substitute teach on the side, but as of late, I'm getting burnt out and concentrating on my business instead.  That being said, it frees up my schedule a LOT and I have most weekdays free during the day.  I was wondering if anyone would want to grab lunch or coffee during the day sometime this week or next!!

About me: I currently work for myself, and to be honest I'm going a little stir-crazy. I have an active weekend life, but during the week things can get a little dull, looking for change! This might sound completely shallow, as some of my best friends are short, but it would be nice to have a few girlfriends my size! (I'm 5'11"!) I'm also a big fan of board games/strategy games. I think of myself as an intellectual, but I also like to go shopping and do my nails despite my (somewhat) lack of fashion sense. So there you have it. I'm also very interested in languages, I speak German and read/write Spanish as well as a bit of French. Currently aiming to learn Italian (thanks Duolingo!) </TEXT>
