	<TEXT> Awesome info and a great read. Can't we just assume that all of these conjectures are true and test (using a supercomputer) as much use cases as possible?

If all our test cases pass it still will not prove anything but if there is just one that fails then we know one or more of these conjectures must be false?

Having to do with primes, I imagine that the Riemann Zeta function will be most useful for decryption / encrypting technology? Is it not possible to currently assume these prime finding conjectures are true and use them for practical purposes, in a way then treat them like *magic* until they are proven right via a proof or wrong by having them fail with a practical example? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But even smart people who have not learned how to be skeptical or how to apply the scientific method will end up with an erroneous conclusion.

Sad but true, friend of mine is an accountant and doing very well for himself (his is an intelligent person, same as the OPs dad I believe) but he also from time to time come up with these crazy theories doing the rounds. 

Stuff like the moon landings where faked, flat earth theory, creationism. And of course he firmly believes in any conspiracy theories.

The biggest difference between him and myself is that I have a B.Sc degree and thus know and believe in the scientific method.

One of the better quotes about the scientific method I like is that it is 'an explanation for explanations'.

The problem though is to convince people about what is true and correct when these proofs becomes based on other proofs and data acquired by lots of individuals.

To somebody who don't know the scientific method, all of this may just seem like a house of cards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The real problem is the switching technology needed to convert the light beam back into a data stream understandable by the receiving end of the optics.

Any system is only as fast as the slowest portion of the system. The real benefit of using fiber optics is that it is a cheap (relative to using metals) and reliable method of sending data over large distances.

Currently as far as I know light is not used to do the actual computation without the light signal at some point being converted to an electronic signal. </TEXT>

You can reset all your attributes and skills later. 

The best advice is to try and have as many skill lines represented on your active action bar while leveling in order to level up all your skill lines without the need to grind out some at max level. 

Play the game the way you want and enjoy, this is what makes ESO great.  </TEXT>

I just watched this movie again (I find it awesome btw) and can't really figure out the reason why Gibarian visited Kevin on the space station.

It makes even less sense especially if Solaris purposely made Gibarian to appear due to Gibarian basically warning Kevin to leave or he will die.

	<TEXT> Great reply thanks, what is your view on extremely complex math like for instance the proposed proof to the ABC conjecture?

Is all math independent from our actual universe and only exist as a series of more and more elaborate logical proofs building on each other?

When these proofs gets sufficiently complex, would there be a possibility that something taken as a logical proof by mathematicians ends up later being a fallacy? In other words, are elaborate logical proofs really always 100% true? (I know the fact that we name it a proof implies that for us it seems to be true, but is it really when it cannot be measured in the real world but only described by pages and pages of subsequent dependent proofs assumed to be true).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for sharing your story. My best friend whom I new from kindergarten right through school and university died last year from cancer. We were both raised only by our mothers and together we discovered BG, IWD and PST. BG came out while we were in university. 

We would spend countless hours replaying these games and trying out all sorts of character combinations. We had long nights of just discussing the DnD world. Played all the Elder Scrolls games together. 

He was like my brother, we even got married to our wifes in the same month. 

The cancer made him suffer through countless operations and chemotherapy. It was a sad relieve when he died after 2 years of suffering. 

These days I still find myself thinking at times while playing crpgs "hey, let me phone Ollie and hear what his take is on this plot twist" only to realize that I can't. I may never do that ever again. 

I really feel for your loss friend, death of a loved one with whom you shared a bond is by far the most painful emotion one can have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is important to realize that it is the rate at which the distance between two points increases that exceeds the speed of light, and that it is not the actual points moving faster than the speed of light.

So to answer the questions

1. It may be an artifact from the Big Bang that is causing space to grow (like for example at the bottom of the ocean where two tectonic plates are moving away from each other and new sea floor is created between two points on either side of a plate). It may also be dark energy that drives this expansion.
2. Yes the rate at which the distance between certain points increase in the universe is currently greater than the speed of light. This may continue to happen indefinitely (powered by dark energy) up to a point where space becomes so stretched out that atoms are ripped apart. This is called the Big Rip https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe#Big_Rip

	<DATE> 2017-02-25 10:47:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all

Firstly I have a reasonable knowledge of physics and biology (at least college level for both, but not university level). I firmly believe in the Big Bang theory and evolution.

In a nutshell I believe the order of events with regards to life to be something like this:

1. Big Bang takes place.
2. Mostly hydrogen in the initial universe with some helium being formed.
3. Gravity causes hydrogen to form massive stars.
4. These massive stars forges carbon and oxygen and other heavier metals in their cores.
5. Stars explode and this star dust forms rocky planets around other newly formed stars created by the left over hydrogen from the heavier stars.
6. Enough time passes and the rocky planets cool down enough to form atmospheres. And if just far and close enough from its host star even liquid water could form.
7. In these early oceans hydrocarbon molecules leak into the water via vents.
8. These hydrocarbon molecules forms longer and longer chains.
9. Eventually RNA, DNA and proteins are formed.

All the above is still *easily explainable* by physics and chemistry.

Now what I don't get is what happened next to go from carbon based molecules to single cell organisms. 

Some of my questions are:

1. How did DNA know (at a chemical level) that it had to create a membrane around it?
2. How did the other much needed sub cellular components like the mitochondria know that it must be close enough to the core DNA of the cell to be included in a membrane?
3. For how long did single cell organisms form from forming a membrane around molecules? Is this still happening today? If not why not?
4. How did the first single cellular organism know (on a chemical level) that it was time to reproduce and split into two?
5. When did life go from simple chemical replication to complex cellular reproduction?

	<TEXT> Playing from South Africa and I have the exact same problem. Ping is very unstable and will jump to 999+ for no reason and then go back to 250. 

Weird thing is that in WoW and SWTOR my ping is stable for hours on end while raiding and PvPing. Sits at 210 ms for both.

I looked at the network activity while playing these games and ESO seems to use a lot more packets in a given time. So what I think is happening is that due to the distance some packets arrive out of order at ZOS and the game server can't handle this and your ping jumps to 999+ until the packets start to arrive in order again. 

Another thing is that in WoW and SWTOR you have a 1.5 second global cool down but can queue your next ability 1 second before the global cool down ends. Also most skills have cool down of a couple of seconds and WoW even allows you to initiate the next cast when their is only 33% left of the cool down. 

Thus WoW and SWTOR are extremely latency friendly. You can even simulate damage in simulationcraft by setting the latency to 250 ms. A simulation at 20 ms and 250 ms usually only differ by at most 5 percent over a 5 minute fight. This makes skill and pre planning more important than latency. 

I could do progression raiding and arena PVP very well in WoW with my 210 ms latency. 

I made peace with the fact that in ESO I will only do normal questing and LFG dungeons and raiding. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In high school accounting we had an alcoholic sub teacher  for a few weeks. His drinking got progressively worse until one day while scribbling unreadable stuff on the board, he pissed himself wet with urine running out of his trousers over his shoes and creating a puddle on the floor. 

Worst thing is that he didn't even notice it happening and just continued to mumble and scratch on the black board. Class started to laugh uncontrollably such that the teacher from the class room next to us came storming in. When she realized what happened she yelled at the sub and send us all out of the class room and the class captain of to call the principal. 

Never found out what happened to this dude, but we didn't see him ever again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all

I am most definitely not a certified mathematician but I really enjoy reading about math and number theory (perhaps in another life I would have liked to have been one).

Anyhow, why would solving the ABC conjecture be of importance to us? And also why is the proof given by Shinichi Mochizuki so difficult to peer review and confirm?

Is it not possible that the math gets so abstract and convoluted after ten's of pages with proofs building on proofs made in the same text, that close to anything can be solved by using enough back and forth math (my layman's proposal here)? Or is the incredibly complicated proof to this relatively simple looking conjecture (from a layman's perspective) a whole new level of genius? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What specific technology is used that enables a RDMS to return results so quickly? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi all

What amazes me is that a RDMS is able to deliver a query result extremely quickly.

I presume that most of the code that need to execute very quickly has been written in C or assembly?

What else is used to increase speed? Are some tables loaded into memory? If so, what determines which tables?

Would appreciate any feedback or links that explains the finer details of this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I can't imagine that there would be any return trips; they certainly wouldn't be cost-effective no matter how many quadrillion dollars they made on the last colony (a separate issue I won't get into at this time.)

Actually not making return trips would be costly. To built such a huge ship for a one way journey would be a waste. They use some form of nuclear fusion to fuel and power the ship, so the fuel portion could be taken care of by using very *cheap* hydrogen gas, even scooping some from the outer atmosphere when they slingshot around a massive star.

Typically earth could at this point be in short supply of precious metals and seeing how they are needed in most electronic circuits, the returning ship could send a few tonnes of this back to earth to make up what possible passengers would have paid. </TEXT>

By having the master key to everything in the ship and thus access to the best food, drinks (even a gentlemanly barman), swimming pool with the most awesome view, everything done for you by robots, access to any clothes you want and all of this for free for the rest of your life without having to work another single day makes me envy them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well presumably everybody that applied for the trip went for very extensive thorough medicals before the time that would pick up any dormant illnesses. So in essence the passengers and crew are very healthy individuals .If a small stand alone pod can scan a person in five seconds and give a detailed analyses, just imagine how thorough they will be able to scan you in a medical facility on earth.

The autodoc is really only there for the very rare occasional accident.  </TEXT>
