	<TEXT> Yeah, it's pretty sad. I seriously feel as if they're all just lonely people looking to be accepted, so they've created this hivemind mentality to feel as if they're part of some sort of family to compensate for their lack of self-identity in real life. It's probably why they're so hateful, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, Muslims in the Middle-East may oppress women. But those are Muslims representative of the Middle-East, not Muslims around the whole world (Albania,
Azerbaijan,
Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Burkina Faso,
Chad,
Cte d'Ivoire,
Guinea,
Guinea-Bissau, and so on). Do people in Spain represent people in the US? No? I thought so. Do Christian Brazilians represent Christian Americans? No. So stop criticising Islam on the basis of what one country is doing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that you're willing to stop this is great as it is and shows that you're not as sick as you perceive yourself to be. As others have suggested, there is no better advice anyone can give you other than to consult a professional. They will have a legal right to keep the information you disclose confidential, they are there to help you, NOT send you to prison, especially when you haven't even acted on your desires.

Please don't kill yourself over something like this. You have a loving boyfriend, and I assume other people who care for you deeply (parents, friends, relatives, and so on). You haven't actually committed a crime, so you have NOTHING to loose. You're willing to change and that's all that matters. I wish you the best! </TEXT>

Then you have the audacity to call us brainwashed when you post in r/the_donald, a sub which has literally brainwashed its members into thinking Donald Trump is a "God Emperor" and the SLIGHTEST criticism against him gets you permanently banned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My original comment was directed towards a person specifically saying he dislikes far right populists, but that he also dislikes hijabs because he feels Muslim women are oppressed by being required to wear them by Muslim culture. So I respond saying that it is not required and that nowhere in the Quran does it specifically instruct women to wear hijabs or burqas. Then you push a strawman argument saying that the Quran has much worse hadiths, while also saying the new Testament also advocates violence when that has little relevance to the point I was making. You are making no sense whatsoever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And I bet if I cared enough, I could find 10 more Biblical passages just as horrible. Please find me a passage or hadith in the Quran which requires women to wear SPECIFICALLY hijabs and burqas if you think I'm lying.  </TEXT>
