I bet he was glaring at the bully in reality. They only showed what the teacher saw.. maybe not what was actually happening. She is convinced it is ziggy so she isn't even looking at the other kids. 

I hope the therapist (that the teacher herself picked) sends her a full report on her impressions of Ziggy - that he's likely not the bully and may be being bullied himself. </TEXT>

Adam wrote the movie and he's portraying Hannah as this weepy, pathetic, sick girl in need of rescuing. 

I don't know if Hannah and Adam will get back together but I think this film will be the undoing of Jessa and Adam.

	<TEXT> Throughout the back and forth exchange between Leo and Karen there is a monitor over her right shoulder playing a clip of Rev. Jesse Jackson. I wonder if this was chosen on purpose and if so, why?

Also I think the scene where Leo is uses the "man falls in a hole" (http://westwing.bewarne.com/queries/story.html) story to reassure Josh about his PTSD in the "Noel" episode (https://youtu.be/ZQJ6yqQRAQs) is also very good with respect to recovery.

	<TEXT> I feel like the writers are stretching here, to point where it's just not working with respect to Raj and his financial situation. It would have been much more realistic if he lost his job (it's not like he has any real storyline tied to the university) and making it so that his parents cut him off a long time ago. 

This would make the character's circumstances even more difficult and having much more potential for a decent story and character growth. Raj could have gone on a few job interviews, have a storyline where he must consider whether he will move to another city, some professional rivalry for a new position, maybe with another female astrophysicist he's attracted to, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although this institution and its practices are from a completely different era when social services fell under the purvey of religious organizations one does wonder if this model might be more successful in helping those in need today. 

This structure housed individuals in rooms with many beds (no privacy) but everyone was expected to contribute by helping with daily chores unless they were ill. During particularly difficult economic times there was also an outdoor soup kitchen that fed other non-residents. I believe some of the food donations came from the nearby St. Lawrence Market. 

Perhaps my impression is misguided but I get the sense that people who received services during this era were able to better move on with their lives because of the sense of community created by and the compassion extended from the Sisters of St. Joseph. Or maybe it's more of an artifact of a bygone era where the culture was different and also economic opportunities helped change the fate of many residents.

	<TEXT> It's about many things including crime, poverty, corruption but most importantly it's about social justice. But not in a preachy way though.

There's also quite a bit of humour (e.g., "Fuzzy Dunlop" as one example) and it's very realistic almost to the point of making you uncomfortable.  

I would recommend it. One warning though - there's a lot of characters and it can be tricky to follow everything at first. I got so much more out if it when I watched it a second time. So there's that to look forward to! </TEXT>

Solid ep... at least from comedic standpoint, not sure if 'poor Raj' will be fun.

	<TEXT> A few loose thoughts...

- We know that anyone who is held captive by Eric and Edie will eventually be killed because they have seen their faces.

- Are we to assume the grandmother is not exactly with it? She obviously knows Eric is living there but seems oblivious to everything else. Doesn't she wonder what they do in the basement? I guess she can't go down there because she has limited mobility (I recall her using a walker to answer the door when the police we canvassing the neighbourhood).

- I didn't think Eric was going to shoot Woody because that would create noise. I'm guessing the grandmother would have heard that as she's not deaf. Interesting (and convenient) that he also had a knife.

- The actor (Brendan Fletcher) that plays Eric reminds me of a character from the show "Six Feet Under". I think his name was Billy Chenoweth and was Brenda's sister. That character was also "a bit off" so maybe that's part of it.

- I may have missed this explanation from an earlier episode. I'm assuming we're dealing the local police in Algonquin Bay. Or is the provincial police? I'm not clear on how Delorme was transferred (did she come from the financial crimes division in another city or just another department?). If it's the former than why does her mother live nearby and how is it that she and her husband are settled in this community? If it's the latter than how has she not crossed paths with Cardinal before as the police department would be very small?

- Knowledge of how serial killers operate is specialized and would likely come from working in homicide in a large city. So we know how Cardinal acquired his skills and the strategy of including the mother in the press conference. I believe it's a known tactic to attempt to humanize the victim in the captors' eye. Yet Sergeant Dyson believes it will have the opposite effect. How would she have that knowledge? Does she also have experience with this type of crime? Seems like Algonquin Bay might have a bit of a problem with serial killers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gregor Mendal, now recognized as the father of genetics. Known primary for the following, "Mendel coined the terms recessive and dominant in reference to certain traits" (citation from Wikipedia article linked below) he discovered how genetic traits are passed down.

Because he lacked an academic appointment he could not get his experiments in the most prestigious journals of the time. He was still able to get his work published and it was found many years later after his death.

	<TEXT> In a hospital there is a difference of how the institution is governed (e.g., managing the budgets, determining contracts for employees, procurement contracts for supplies, etc., decisions around building, maintenance and expansion, resource allocation and occasionally legal issues) and how the medical practise is managed. If the hospital is private and for profit it reports to the owners (or shareholders if applicable) about their investment returns.

The board does not generally get involved matters directly related to the practise of medicine. That's for attendings and ultimately the Chief of Staff to deal with.

Although Meredith is a co-owner and on the board (AFAIK) this has no bearing over Bailey's power to suspend her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone have any stories of visits to the Haida when she was alongside Ontario Place?

I was surprised at how small it was on-board and below deck. It also felt as though the exterior had the consistency of a "tin can". It didn't exactly convey a sense of sturdiness. I know the ship was old when I was aboard but I would be concerned it wouldn't survive crossing Lake Ontario never mind the Atlantic Ocean. 

This link (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal-class_destroyer_(1936)#1944) describes the action the Haida and her crew saw during the war. Quite an impressive record.

	<TEXT> I agree with your comment about the reveal of Edie and Eric and their role as being atypical. I've seen this technique used before and it can be effective. I think the film, "Silence of the Lambs" would qualify as one example.

I think the purpose behind not allowing the viewer into the world of criminal is mainly to build suspense and increase fear. This has its place as well. One example of this would be the shower scene in "Psycho". What's missing from that scene is more scary than what's shown.

By having the police officer conducting the neighbourhood canvas within earshot of the captor/captive hiding in the basement heightens suspension. Of course the viewer wants the police to hear Keith's screams when he's questioning the grandmother but we're left hanging for the time being. 

I found this episode to be slow moving but still advancing the plot. We not only know about the existence of Eric and Edie and their role, we also know where they work and that Edie is self conscious about her eczema. Her relationship with Eric is obviously twisted. We also know that Edie is a "rule follower". She won't punch in her late co-worker to cover for her being late and she won't take a piece of the gum she's stolen.

I'm not too invested in the Corporal Musgrave's investigation of Cardinal other than I think it's going to cause problems, perhaps trust issues with Delorme down the line.

I'm not sure where they're going by including the secondary storylines with the personal lives of both Cardinal and Delorme. I don't think they detract from the main story but I wonder if they will be wrapped up or explained in a satisfying manner given the limited number of episodes.

Recently I received an email from my doctor's office (in Toronto) suggesting I fill out a survey:

Any research affiliated with a university requires approval from a Research Ethics Board (e.g., http://www.research.utoronto.ca/faculty-and-staff/research-ethics-and-protections/). 

Shouldn't this company be held to the same standard (which would include a review of the technical aspects of data collection and storage)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A flair is a word or series of words that can be used to describe your personality for sub. It appears beside your username within each sub that you've set it for. For example, if you are in the NFL sub you can add your favourite team as your flair.

If you are logged in to Reddit via a browser (as opposed to an app) you should see the following text in the sidebar on the right:

"Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like:"

with a checkbox option. I have it checked off but I don't see any options yet. I think this is because the mod asked for suggestions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some key points about using open data from this article (big caveat first - useful data, which has been carefully collected/cleaned must be made available first before any open data effort can be even remotely useful):

- Using open data to predict health code violations in restaurants in advance (goodbye 'dine safe', hello 'don't dine')

- Data-driven decision-making: Not likely feasible IMHO. Decision makers have had access to studies and reports for decades. Historically it has been shown that they may or may not take these findings into into consideration. I'm already dubious as to the robustness of any research conducted and presented in these reports as the skill set of the author(s) varies considerably never mind that which may come from an open data release.

- Transparency: the city and its agencies (e.g., police services) only release what they want when they want so it's hard to rely on the data being of any real merit. Some organizations can use privacy policies to block the release of data.

If you're interested in how some of the data sets released in Toronto are being used you may want to check out Open Data Toronto:

	<TEXT> Thanks! That show was also shot in Canada (Hamilton and other areas in southern Ontario). I was able to buy it on iTunes/Apple TV not long after it finished airing. Although I missed out on discussing it online in real time at least I was able to see it. 

I will be on the lookout for "The Handmaid's Tail" via these other mechanisms.

	<TEXT> Sister Mary knows Lenny and his weaknesses well. 

She set him up by anonymously sending him the other half of his father's pipe and hiring imposters to play his parents. Somehow Lenny SNIFFS this deception out.

She gets the documents she wanted signed and knows to butter Lenny up when he accuses her of orchestrating this entire ruse. So it looks like Lenny will have the last laugh though unless Sister Mary has something else planned. Frankly I doubt it as it seems like Lenny is the master conniver of the two. </TEXT>

In the past these places would have been on the edge of the city. Toronto in 1861 only had 44,000 people in it after all. 

The eastern boundary of the original ten blocks of the city of Toronto was Parliament Street:

Power Street, where the remains are buried is located exactly one block east of Parliament.
