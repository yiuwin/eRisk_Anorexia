	<TEXT> About 6 years ago I had fucked this very beautiful punk rock chick. And I guess you could consider me a "prep" but nothing about my character would say that I am it's just the way I dress. Anyways, we had fucked 2 or 3 times and always realized some cutting scars on her thighs. Just thought she was a self mutilator and didn't judge her for it. But one day when we were about to fuck she pulled out a razor blade and told me to cut her while I fuck her. Couldn't do it. I just had images of me on the news for killing a chick.  </TEXT>
