Also the there is the introduction of the effigy system. You dont have to rest at a bonfire to turn human again. And human effigies are quite common. So dont fear exploring.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mainly due to the adaptability, souls memory mechanics. It'll never surpass Dark Souls 1. 

But it's a bad game in no way. I'm currently on my first playthrough. And i must admit the later half of the game is really good. And the DLCs are some of the best souls content ever. Definitely play the game. Also plus points are the sheer number of builds you can go with, NG+ is actually different and last but not the least FASHION SOULS.   </TEXT>
