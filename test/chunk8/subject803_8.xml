	<TEXT> Okay, how would you solve it?

It can't be an ordinary brother, because it's almost impossible for two brothers who were not born at the same time to look the same.

He also can't come back as himself, since he's dead and all.


So how would you approach it, do you want him to stay in Smallville?

I personally think the Daily Planet is an **extremely** important part of Superman's mythos. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Devin was a shitmonger.Karma finally caught up to him if u ask me,he was a good writer though (hate to admit that)

So let's get this straight.

- Devin is invited to the JL London set by WB.

- Devin takes a photo of the Batmobile and [his report of the set visit is mild and informative](http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2016/06/21/a-hater-tours-the-justice-league-set).

- Fong finds it appropriate to say "wish it ran him over".

You think it's ok because Devin is a "shitmonger"?

It was Faraci's job as a critic/reporter to discuss his opinions on movies and industry news.

That is a far cry from insulting the person directly. </TEXT>

John Kent was a normal farmer like his father, but when Clark died abruptly...John felt it necessary to continue his brother's life work.

	<TEXT> I doubt Martha would feel comfortable living on the Watchtower or whatever and I think Clark would be very hesitant before allowing her to be endangered by his superheroics a third time.

She wouldn't be living in the Watchtower though.

I honestly don't have a problem with Martha working, but working as a waiter earning minimum wage in a seedy bar just doesn't sit well with me.

Also, Martha's kidnapping should show Superman that just leaving her in Smallville and hoping she doesn't get hurt no longer works.

Her working as the Watchtower manager would allow the JL to focus on saving people.

- She's the most trustworthy person, hiring a random person would be detrimental to their safety (betrayal a la S.H.I.E.L.D).

- She knows how to treat and help superhuman beings......she raised one afterall.

- Smallville must be lonely, her husband is dead and she has no more family there.

- The JL can confide sensitive/personal matters to her since she's essentially part of the family.

- The Watchtower is safer for her than Smallville (the kidnapping proves this)

- The JL becomes a place where the heroes could be themselves, and there needs to be someone who keeps things in order while they're away. I mean, when was the last time Barry, Bruce or Diana ate a home cooked meal.

- She would get a really good salary and can live with her son in the city.

- Martha and Lois would have more time to catch up (in my head canon, she's the official correspondent for the JL)

	<TITLE> DISCUSSION: A way Superman could return to the Daily Planet. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A few days ago, I thought of a way he could return to his old life.

Bruce buying the Daily Planet and talking with Perry could create a situation where Superman could work as a reporter again.

Perhaps telling Perry the truth while telling the other reporters that he was Clark Kent's twin brother......John Kent.

With Bruce's money and power, faking the existence of a twin brother living in Smallville isn't that hard.

However, I foresee Bruce teaching him how to change his [posture](http://imgur.com/a/FJqov) and [inflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ2rgTiKF2w).

Afterall, he is no longer Clark Kent...but he is still Superman.

	<TEXT> wanna give your marvel brain a try?

Why is everything so black and white to you?

If you were given a chance to made it more sense by introducing a scene in a future movie where Clark and Bruce talk about that moment and why did batman stop? how would you play it out?

I wouldn't add a scene with Bruce and Clark discussing what happened in BvS, there are far more interesting things for them to discuss.

However, I would add a "Martha" moment.

Martha becoming the "den mother" to the JL is a neat idea I would like explored in future DCEU movies.

It irked me that Martha was working in a bar....maybe it's my upbringing...but when your parents are that old, they shouldn't work anymore (the son/daughter should provide for them).

After Superman's resurrection, Bruce could come and introduce himself to her.



The JL is filled with people who are emotionally scarred and alone, so a person who exudes warmth is necessary for morale. 

- Barry's father is in jail and his mother is dead.

- Cyborg's father never treated him lovingly and his mother is dead.

- Wonder Woman is far away from her family and doesn't associate with anybody. 

- Aquaman lost both his mother and father, he has no connection in land.

- Batman lost both his father and mother, Martha could help with his emotional scars (treating him like a second son).

Martha baking cookies while Alfred takes care of the military upgrades in the JL watch tower would be a sight to behold.

Afterall, it's not necessary for his mother to live far away from her own son.

After Supes gets resurrected, I think she will realise how important the time they spend together is.

After seeing her use electricity, I thought "Tohru" was another way of saying "Thor"....the God of Lightning in Norse mythology (and Marvel).

Realised I was wrong after I started watching.

Who said it was redeemeable?

All I said is that Batman is different than Marvel heroes and the US military, since he's a vigilante and a civilian.

We were not talking about morality but about the criminal justice system.

By your statement, batman in prison would redeem him but saving the world wouldn't?

I think you misunderstand prison sentences

Jail sentence is the **punishment** for crimes.

There is no substitute. 

Do the crime...do the time.

All I'm trying to say, is that Batman killing takes away all his agency.

He can no longer take the higher moral ground and catch criminals....since he doesn't have the right anymore.

	<TEXT> So when obama or trump orders a drone strike in the middle east and kill dozens of civilians while missing their intended targets its fine because the government sanctioned it?

I suggest you research the "Civilian Casualty Ratio" and "Acceptable Loss", every attack the US government carries out causes civillian death.

I never said it was right or even moral, but it is legal.....

No, you're on a high horse because from your initial comment you seem to insinuate that no matter what anyone does to try to repent for their mistakes- they should always be judged for that one mistake and anything else they do should be disregarded even if what they do to make up for the mistake (saving the world from apokolips and assembling the greatest heroes in the world to fight for good) far out trumps their initial mistake (blowing up a few goons).

The problem I'm having with you, is that you are comparing a criminal offense with a mistake.

A mistake is lying to your wife, farting in public or betraying a friend.

All of these actions are redeemable.....but murder?

You are also belittling just how heinous Batman's crime is.

Batman **did not kill goons**

He killed paid mercenaries that were tasked to bring a shipment of legal goods (the kryptonite) to the owner (Lex Luthor).

They weren't evil, just following orders.

Each one of those men had families (children, parents, wives/girlfriends/boyfriends).

Batman didn't even have to attack them.

He shot the tracker on the truck and could've easily waited until they reached Lexcorp to steal it  (which he did anyway).

A question if I may, the Suicide Squad saved the world....why aren't they being released?

In your own words, (saving the world from Enchantress) far out trumps their initial mistake. </TEXT>

The bat mobile is so strong, not even a 50 cal Gatling gun could damage it.

Furthermore, the man (KG Beast) shooting the missile at him did so after Batman killed nearly all of his men.

	<TEXT> I thought we were talking about redemption and whether batman can atone for his mistakes.

That's exactly it, he **can't** be redeemed....unless he goes to jail and serves his sentence.

If your point is that we should judge superheroes in a court of law, every single marvel and Dc hero would be locked up for murder or at the least billions of dollars of property destruction

Marvel's superheroes work under the US government and S.H.I.E.L.D, they are given the same leeway and agency as the US military.

A person under the employ of the government is different to a vigilante/civilian working by himself.

Even then, their actions are always under scrutiny. 

if you're point is that Batman is as bad as Bill Cosby

I used Bill Cosby as an example to show just how preposterous your argument is.

This was your comment;

**So he should've just kept 300 million for himself because people like you will always seem him as a monster no matter what because you won't get off your high horse and the world is black and white**

This is how I interpreted it: If a murderer gives 300 million dollars in charity - he should no longer be considered a monster and that I was on a high horse for not seeing that.

Bill Cosby was a much beloved comedian that was also extremely philanthropic, should he be forgiven for his actions?

then you might as well not watch any superhero films

The DCEU have decided to approach the universe with as much realism as possible.

If the Justice League becomes an official organisation acknowledged by the UN, Batman would be an official hero....no longer a vigilante bound by law.

In BvS...that is not the case.

	<TEXT> U do know batman is essentially a criminal right?



His status as a criminal is pretty null and void.

In the beginning, he was treated like every other criminal and lunatic....but his work to bring the crime families (and other major criminals) to justice made him a hero in the eyes of the people and the law.

Batman's "no kill" rule and his insistence to work inside the confines of the law is what convinced Gordon to work with him.

His track record and modus operandi has made him a trustworthy fixture of Gotham.

The police love him because they get the praise for catching criminals without endangering themselves - while the people love him for keeping the streets safe.

In Gotham, Batman is not a criminal....it is because of this that he has operated for twenty years.

If he betrays their trust and starts killing....then he loses both his immunity and the trust of the people.

	<TEXT> I think it will undermine his future decisions.

How can a man who kills, put other people (with far lesser offences like burglary or aggravated assault) in jail.

Think about it, Captain Boomerang was given three life sentences for multiple burglaries (where he did not kill a single soul) but somehow Batman kills multiple henchman and doesn't.

The entire reason both the GCPD and civillians accept the presence of Batman is that he works *with* the law.

He never acted as a judge, jury and executioner...he simply grabbed criminals and let the GCPD book them.

It's that aversion to killing that has made Batman trustworthy to everyone.

You can't brush away his actions and act like it didn't happen.

After seeing the JL trailer, I'm really worried Gordon won't even acknowledge Bruce's actions in BvS.

If Batman is given leeway for the 19-21 people he killed in BvS, shouldn't all other criminals?

There is no such thing as being redeemed for a crime.

Bruce was not redeemed after Superman's death......his actions and crimes are set in stone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BvS isn't bloated. It's just painfully inefficient.

When I got out of BvS for the first time, my friend said something very interesting to me.

Friend: *"Hey subject803"*

Me: *"Yeah"*

Friend: *"Is it just me, or did two thirds of the movie feel like the first episode to a 6 part series, only for it to go into overdrive and end abruptly?"*

Me: *".........you should be a critic...."*

BvS used so much time to slowly build Batman's conflict, the African incident, Lex's super evil plan, the Kryptonite, Clark's investigations, the Capitol Hill bombing, Wallace's subplot etc.

Then, right after Lex kidnaps Martha, the movie goes into overdrive - with the BvS fight ending woefully short and Doomsday crashing the party fashionably late.

And we have Superman causing massive collateral damage in Metropolis and then jump to him causing collateral damage in Nairomi.

dat dramatic irony boi :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty sure if Batman hadn't been thrown into the mix you would have gotten the follow up to MOS you were hoping for. BvS gives us Superman after the phase you've described. Just a pity that no effort was made to point this out.

I honestly didn't want a MoS sequel, I think BvS (in theory) was the perfect follow up to MoS.

If planned well, BvS could've explored both Superman and Batman's characters thoroughly - while also incorporating the storylines from the comics.

	<TEXT> He's not dark here either and his character progressed logically thanks to him being an actual person and not a piece of bread not affected by its surroundings.

He is dark.....scratch that.

He's mostly brooding and sad (dark in the Knightmare).

I felt this about MoS as well, why doesn't anybody talk to Supes like a normal person?

They are always talking about how important he is, how special he is, the importance of his existence etc.

The movies treats him more as a plot progression device than an actual character with real conversations and emotions.

The few scenes in the Daily Planet were amazing, as it focused on Clark being a normal reporter.

A person suffering PTSD is not sad/depressed always.

They live their lives like everybody else, but have episodes and nightmares.

You never see the enjoyment of Superman's work....the montage distanced us emotionally from him.....and that's no good for one of the biggest characters in the universe.

We're told why Superman's important, why people hate him, why people love him...but we never see the necessary progression from MoS.

MoS began with a recluse who finally accepted his origins and got a woman who loves him. The ending scene was after the BZ event and shows a bright and happy man content with his life.

Where did that man go?

	<TEXT> Superman is **not** dark in the comic books!

He goes through harrowing pain and insurmountable obstacles - but the character itself is not dark.

Superman is still the farmer from Smallville that enjoys his life and work.

Superman in alternate universes like Injustice....hella dark.

Normal continuity Superman - still the shining beacon of Metropolis.

What infuriates me the most, is that we were already there.....the Superman we had at the end of MoS was **perfect**. 

I wanted BvS to be a Clark/Superman story that explores his guilt/PTSD from the BZ event while he lives his life as a reporter.

Saving people should be his way of leaving the world's issues behind and enjoying himself.....saving people should be a hobby for him.

This is then contrasted with Batman, who hates vigilantism after twenty years of fighting crime.

TLDR;

Superman is not a dark character and BvS already had the perfect point to continue Superman's story (his character progression from MoS was lost in BvS)

He is considered a God in his country (Kahndaq), has military/political might and the powers of multiple gods (Shu, Heru, Amon, Zehuti, Aton and Mehen).

His links to Ancient Egypt could also introduce Dr Fate and the Helmet of Anubis

Dwayne Johnson having a more substantial role in the DCEU is the way to go.

	<TITLE> QUESTION: If the Parademons in JL end up being innocent civilians who were turned, would you accept Batman killing them? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In multiple DC stories, parademons are kidnapped humans that were turned into slaves by Darkseid.

A few shots in the Justice League trailer seem to corroborate this, with the parademons looking [infected](http://imgur.com/a/Q4urT).

Obviously this is a speculation....

However, if the movie **does** go in this direction, how would you feel about Batman killing them?

What about the rest of the Justice League?

If you were a part of the JL, would you accept their deaths as collateral damage or would you avoid killing them (and try to save them)?

In Islam, one of the most important regulations when it comes to marriage is the girl's choice/opinion.

If she doesn't want to marry someone, no one can force her to.

The girl (don't know if she's 12) doesn't look happy, or at least that's what I interpreted.

It's a very weird mentality I've noticed in the music,movie and entertainment sector.

No matter how bad a product is, there will always be a person telling people to be happy they got anything.

Shouldn't it be the other way around?

We, as the consumers are giving developers,artists and studios money.....shouldn't they be full of gratitude?

It's not like they're doing it for free....they're making the game for monetary gain.

So when a game like Andromeda comes out in the appalling condition it's in, I find it downright infuriating to hear someone tell me to be full of gratitude and love for the [100 dollars I spent](http://imgur.com/a/HrC6Z) that I now regret (I should've bought Nier Automata) </TEXT>

The graphics are questionable for a game made in 2017, the facial animations are lacking and the bugs have made the game a meme.

I would much rather like Superman imposters running around saving people than more emphasis on religion.

	<TEXT> But : people probably would.
They would view a being like that through such cultural filters, and perhaps even absorb him into their own traditions - call him the Resurrection or the Mahdi or Krishna etc.

I think they've already lost their opportunity to explore religion and Superman.

BvS was the perfect point to show the various religions that popped up due to Superman's existence.

However, now that he died.......I want people to see him as "one of them" - rather than an all mighty God.

	<TEXT> I'm not sure where you're getting that implication from... Slut-shaming isn't something that only applies to sluts.

*"In human sexuality, slut-shaming is a form of social stigma applied to people, especially women and girls, who are perceived to violate traditional expectations for sexual behaviours. Some examples of circumstances wherein women are "slut-shamed" include violating dress code policies by dressing in perceived sexually provocative ways, requesting access to birth control, having premarital, casual, or promiscuous sex, engaging in prostitution, or when being victim blamed for being raped or otherwise sexually assaulted."* - Wikipedia

It doesn't make sense for Kobayashi to say "stop slut-shaming me" when she has done nothing sexual in nature. </TEXT>

How did *"I think you might be mistaken, I'm not a slu..."* turn into *"don't slut shame me"*

The sentence "don't slut shame me" implies that Kobayashi **did** sleep/have relations with Tohru but didn't want to be shamed for it.

Totally changes the meaning of the scene.
