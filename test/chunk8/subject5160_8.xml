	<TEXT> This is just Farnese lamenting her unrequited feelings of love for Guts. I don't see anything more that can be realistically read into it than that. As i said in another thread, there is literally no way that Farnese will use the Behelit because she is going to see the eclipse in Casca's memories and what the direct effects of using the Behelit will be and the abject horror that would ensue from using it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea if Sheirke and Farnese are going to see and feel everything that Casca did during the eclipse, thats gonna be some psychic wars level stuff. It begs the question as to what powers the dream God-Hand/Femto will have and if they are in anyway connected to their counterparts in the real world. Perhaps, it will be their means of discovering Elfhelm and they way of bringing about its doom. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is a rough translation by Puella from Skullknight.net

The old magicians comment "Well well, it ended up like this, as expected. When we have a feast, elves can never stay still." Meanwhile Isidro tells tales of his adventures, getting out from fights with tons of evil spirits, and BAM he destroys his enemies with his salamander dagger. Meanwhile drunk Isma shows her merrow-ness, and a couple of mischievous witches in the back tell her "hey, why don't you take a bath here, we put a lot of herbs in there to wash up your fatigue" and so on. Given that they're talking about a cauldron, it seems they really aim to cook her. The dwarves on the other hand seem happy with Azan, commenting on how they get along well. The brownies on the other hand have only one word to say: work! Dismayed, Magnifico questions why he should serve.. As for Puck, he simply utters that it's unfaaaair.

Guts is sitting alone, far away from the party. Roderick and Serpico arrive, Roderick asking "Can I seat next to you, commander? Let's have a good time between men, watching the cherry blossoms at night." He goes on: "I understand how you feel, but you have no choice but leaving her to them, since we've come this far." Serpico adds "I know you're not good at this kind of thing." Guts replies: "It's true that I wasn't, but I have changed a lot. I've realized many things during this journey. When I was all alone, I didn't care about anything, I fought without aim. I didn't care how badly I was beaten up. But since we were two, I felt my sword was heavier, and that I shouldn't die... I changed my reason/way to fight. I couldn't handle it by myself. So I just gave up all of my ways and, with other people's help, I managed to move forward." He goes on: "So I thank you". Serpico is surprised: "Ohhh, how could I ever expect to hear such polite words from you. Maybe you're starting to be drunk...". Guts replies with a simple "Maybe...".

Serpico takes his turn: "Well... though I talk like that, I myself also changed in many ways through this journey. When she and I were in the HICK, we left everything up to god. In a way, those were peaceful days. All we had to do was meekly obey the Holy See. I can't say that we were happy, but it was a proper place for Lady Farnese at the time. However, when we met you everything was swept away. Farnese lost her faith and became fascinated by you, who had destroyed it. While I, who had served her since childhood, couldn't even approach her... you did everything so easily that I had never thought to do. You blew some life into her. To be honest, I felt hatred for you several times, and felt surprised I had such violent feelings within me. But in another way, I was happy and proud of her, who started to work and stand on her two own feet, though it was unstable. And I realized Lady Casca has made Farnese strong. I realized people don't grow up until they get to have someone to protect. Now Farnese is no better than a big sister who takes care of her little sister. Let's trust their connection and wait. I've also changed much, to open my heart like that to my traveling companions. Maybe I'm also drunken."

Roderick is next to speak, telling Serpico: "Ah, you're dangerous, you've got that kind of secret hate!" To Guts he says: "But isn't it good? A big guy like you has lived that kind of adventure, risking your life for a woman to the far end of the sea...". He adds: "I want to die my final days by drowning in the sea, or in liquor or women." Serpico comments matter-of-factly that Roderick's actually drunk. But Guts' thoughts are elsewhere. He thinks back to what the Skull Knight told him, so long ago on that beach: "Above all, what you wish for may not be what she wishes for."

The scene cuts to the dreamscape. Farnese comments "We've walked quite a long ways, where are the petals going towards? They're flying against the wind..." Schierke answers that "Time and distance are vague here. I think we're going to see some sign." They notice a bonfire. Farnese says "Ahh it's warm, let's take a rest for a bit before we get going again." But Schierke isn't fooled, she wonders what's going on. When they see the scene of Guts form, Schierke correctly deduces that it's a fragment of Casca's memory. Farnese puts two and two together: "Then this back, this person is..." They're interrupted by a voice, which in the real world was Casca's voice: "A bonfire... of dreams...". Guts turns back and replies: "Ahh, what a good line. You sound like some kind of princess."

Schierke comments that this is Guts before he met them. Farnese thinks to herself: "The Guts who I don't know." She then comments, surprised: "This feeling transferred to me...". Schierke finishes her thought: "That's what Casca felt at that time". Farnese(?) thinks to herself: "Pitiful and yet warm. A wonderful feeling." The scene vanishes (we hear some more of Casca's talk to Guts from that time) and turns into a broken piece of the doll. Farnese asks what's going on, Schierke gets it. She tells Farnese to open the coffin. Farnese says hi to the little sprite "we meet again", but it cowers before the dog. When he drops the piece onto the doll, it restores it a bit. Farnese comments on it: "The doll was restored...?". Schierke replies "I guess this is the rule of this world. By collecting the fragments of Casca's memory, scattered in this wilderness, we can restore this doll."

The dog barks, and they notice they've got company. Farnese: "They come again, the shadow-like things." Schierke: "This time they're in larger numbers. They probably want to hinder us. Let's fight them." She pulls something out of her bag. Farnese asks what it is. Schierke, somewhat embarrassed, replies "...It seems I brought them from my dream". She goes on: "But this is surely an unexpected chance!" As she activates them, she says: "Hey you! Give us a hand!". And a giant golem and wheel of flames appear. Farnese is amazed, and Schierke tells her it's possible because they're in a dream. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While it served in the Royal Navy, the Black  Joke was armed only with one to two guns. Many of the slaver ships that Black Joke encountered tried to resist and at least two of them were armed with 14 cannons. Despite its meager armament, Black Joke was able to defeat every slave ship it did battle with, an amazing feat considering the odds pitted against it in battle.
