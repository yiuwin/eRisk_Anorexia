	<TEXT> Okay,so i talked to my mom about FIDM,and I'm just waiting to hear back from my sister as well.
My mom said that since FIDM is a for profit school,they guarantee that in addition to the $28,000 tuition,there will be a 10% increase to the tuition EACH year. It's fucked up. I'll have more info to come! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DO NOT DO IT.
My older sister looked into FIDM as well. She learned that for undergrad,she would be looking at like $250,000 debt,as FIDM is a for profit school. 
She toured the campus,met with professors and students,and realized that any girl with a rich enough daddy could get a degree from FIDM.
She choose F.I.T instead. A much more presitigious,reasonably priced,fashion school in New York City. She's going for Merchandise Marketing as well,and she loves it. 
F.I.T. is a school that you have to work to get into,not just have a rich daddy willing to buy you the degree. 
I would say,no,FIDM is not Legit. It's kinda sketchy,insanely expensive,and not worth it in the long run. Like, $250,000 for undergrad??? It's not like it's medical school or something!


Edit: I did more research on F.I.T, it's ranked as being one of the top 5 fashion schools in the world,I texted my sister for more information,but I can pretty confidently say that FIDM is a bad idea </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on the person.
I would wake up fairly early,because my body hates me,and doesn't want me to sleep. 
I'm up by 5:30,at the gym or on a run by 6:00. Then in the shower by 7:00am,doing hair and makeup,cleaning my room,and then just fucking around until my first class.
I study in the library or my dorm room between classes. I go to the gym a lot. I don't leave campus much,parking is a bitch,my small college town doesn't have much going on off campus,and anywhere that I need to go,I walk to.
My last class of the day ends at 3:00,I study until like 6:00,hang out with my boy toy for awhile,study some more,and hang out until midnight.
I'm in bed and asleep by 1:00am.
I hang out with friends a lot,party on the weekends,go to the gym whenever possible,run errands on the weekend,do laundry late on Sunday night(totally perfect time) and I make a point to NOT study at all on Saturdays. Saturday is my day off. Always.

I don't procrastinate much,I party,I have fun,I prioritize,and I still get good grades.
College is fucking awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think I was being ungrateful or entitled by asking about summer classes. I have never taking summer classes or online classes,so I have literally NO idea what to expect. 
I'm definitely taking the classes over the summer, I don't think that I'm being bratty by asking more experienced people for advice on something that I have zero experience in,and I frankly don't understand what I said originally that offended you so much.
Chill the fuck out dude. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why wouldn't college be for me? 
I'm the only one of my friends who is taking college courses this summer,most of my friends are traveling or fucking around,actually. 
I'm only now wrapping up my freshman year,so how would I know what to expect for summer courses?
I'm fully aware that I'm not in high school anymore,the snakiness really isn't necessary  </TEXT>
