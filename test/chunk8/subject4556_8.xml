Hey guys!

I am looking for more moderators to help out with the subreddit, as it grows bigger and the show is picking up steam and not stopping, I figured I would need help for the future!

If you're obsessed with the show and want to help out the community, this would be the best time for you to apply! 


I am looking for **1 moderator** to help with the **CSS and graphics** to evolve the subreddit as the show grows.

I am looking for **1-2 moderators** to help with the **discussion threads** and keeping everything *spoilers free and controlling the threads.*

If you are interested, send the moderation team a message with the Title **"Mod Application for Graphics"** or **"Mod Application for Others"**

Previous mod experience is not required, just need to be an active member of the community! 

Looking forward to getting more people to help around!


**P.S Thanks for all the application! We will make the decision by the end of the week! You can submit until then!* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

Just a friendly reminder that every week after a new episode people wants to screen cap and share their thoughts which I totally understand but please don't put spoilers in the title and  also to use a spoiler tag.


And also for people who watches the promo for the next week's episode, please don't put any future spoilers in the title as well if you want a discussion thread.


In the future, I will be putting up prediction thread so you guys can discuss there.



Come on guys, I don't want to ban anybody for not using spoilers tag properly, that is no fun! 

I will be looking to get more moderators so look out for that post if you're interested in helping out :)

	<TEXT> Are you in the Facebook group?

The owner Jonathan regularly talks to people of the productions, delays, expectation.

Again, I definitely agreed that it is underwhelming with how they communicate to their customers, they should be regularly sending emails to the SDDC Members of all the delays and expectation. 

 
The reason for the delay is that they really got screwed with quality control and the production factory that was making their products so they had to reel back in and looks like they're starting to ramp up with all the new items coming out.

Hopefully this will mean no more delays in the future.  </TEXT>
