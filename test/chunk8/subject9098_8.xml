	<TEXT> As far as we are concerned, all captains are supposed to have a bankai - Zaraki was an exception, at least back then - it was kind of put them in a different level, common soldier would only have zanpakutos, as you progressed you would be able to release shikai, until finally you would be able to reach bankai and try to be a captain.

The thing with Ikkaku's bankai was that he showed it to us after the events of SS arc, which means there was 3 captain's seats left open, Ikkaku was already known for his strength, and with a bankai and a shortage of captain he would sure be a perfect candidate. However, if I'm not mistaken, he even tells Yumichika the reason why he doesn't show his bankai, thus don't trying a place in the 13 squads, it goes as "I want to be a strong warrior and as long as I can't beat captain Kenpachi, I won't try to be a captain myself".

So, we have a great warrior, with a bnkai, who wanted to defeat his captain, but despite that he is still loyal to him, basically his bankai purpose was to develop his character. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Frostfall is basically the first mod I download when I plan to replay Skyrim for one simple reason: Skyrim is known for being a cold land and being able to spend 24/7 in Winterhold or Windhelm or climbing High Hrothgar without any draw backs is unrealistic, but with Frostfall it's not like you are okay now and out of nowhere you are "freezing to death", there are nerfs, skills will grow slower, abilities are affected and you also move slower and those progress until you collapse, maybe you'll die maybe someone will find you and bring you to a nearby inn.

Do you want to spend 24/7 out on Cyrodiil or Morrowind? Sure not a problem, but Skyrim is cold, Frostfall is one of the few mods that if it were on vanilla would be a great add.

About iNeed or it predecessor, which I used more often, Realistic Needs and Diseases, it is aimed for ultra-realism and that would be a no-no for most players, but I understand people that use them.

I hope that u/PossiblyChesko keep his mods coming, or if he is lucky, to get a job in one of dem companies and help them improve much better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nunca fiz curso de teatro, mas quando entrei no curso de ingls, em que me vi obrigado a falar com desconhecidos, ajudou a me soltar de uma certa forma que foi muito proveitosa. Acho que o que voc tem que aprender no  superar a timidez, mas aprender que ningum se preocupa com o que voc faz, quando fiz um outro curso eu j era bem mais proativo porque justamente eu tinha noo de que ningum se importa com o que eu falava ou fazia e essa amarra mental que ns nos impomos nos inibe de fazer as coisas que queremos, no momento que voc se liberta dela, tudo fica bem.

No acho que: fazer teatro = superar timidez, mas  um empurro, mas a vontade tem que sair de voc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, he's a master all 4 of shinigamis arts just like Yama and Aizen. But in the first round it is just a battle of zanjutsu.

Onmitsukido would be the differential

Mmm...I think the only ones that have performed 99 kidos are Aizen (99 hado) and Tessai (99 bakudo)

Someone claimed it was filler, still he can use 91 kido with ease (he did against Aizen) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Source? Urahara was in the Gotei, not the Stealth Force. Why would he have specific training for an organisation he wasn't a member of? Furthermore, he hasn't shown any special Shunpo techniques, unlike Byakuya-who learned at least one from Yoruichi herself.

Head of the detention unit

Ah, the classic "I just glanced at the wiki for sourcing stuff". Filler scene-we have no way to compare Yoruichi to him in Shunpo with any reasonable degree of accuracy.

Turn back the pendulum

Again, filler.

Where was the first filler? Still, he can use 91 and he did against Aizen

Uh, what? Urahara is absolutely not that old, and Yoruichi never called him a great warrior either.

"recognised as a great warrior" is different than "claimed he was a great warrior" or "called as a great warrior" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Zero evidence for this.

SS arc

*91, and good luck using such Hado when your opponent has an omnidirectional offense/defense and won't let himself be caught off guard.

*81 check wikia

Non-sequitur and experience is irrelevant here as urahara spent a century out of combat.

Had a huge space where he could be training with the captain of the kido corps, besides connection with both Yoruichi and Ichigo's dad

And Yamamoto was not.

How a dead person could be relevant? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "[Puh-Lease! I'm just a lowly-but-handsome merchant. How could I possibly perform Bankai?](http://www.marineford.com/attachment.php?aid=284)"

All rounds for Kisuke easily.

1. Kisuke not only is a master swordsman, but a hakuda master. He has Onmitsukido specific training;

2. Kisuke's shunpo is in pair with Yoruichi, which is faster than Byakuya's;

3. Byakuya didn't show any kido up to level 81, meanwhile Kisuke already used a level 99 kido;

4. When Byakuya was a kid, Kisuke was already recognised by Yoruichi as a great warrior, which means he has centuries of experience in despite of Byakuya;

5. Kisuke was one of the "Speacial War Powers".

It is just as Shunsui said about Toshiro, acknowledging his potential, but not quite close to his own powers yet. Give some decades and we can talk about Byakuya being a similar to Kisuke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For some reason Youtube recommended me Sui-feng and Barragan's fight video and I was watching and how silly it sounds, and now that I'm remembering all t he fights seem a bit silly, oddly enough I think the only one that is the most exciting is Yamamoto and Wonderweiss, at least we see some real casualties since Yama-jii is unable to fight any longer and also can't release Ryujiin jakka. Now what about Starrk and Barragan? Starrk takes down 2 former captains like they are nothing, backstabs a half dead captain and inflicts no real damage to Shunsui; Barragan also had a great potential, but that was spent in a boring fight with Sui-feng, even though she lost an arm.

Now let's think of casualties 11 espadas, 4 are alive, one is good, one is the new queen of *Hueco Mundo*, the other has a dog and the last was kept alive because fanbase (nothing against him though). What about the SS? Not even Momo died, those 10 espadas were the best Aizen could gather?

Not only that, if we analyse fight such as Kenpachi and Nnoitra's we will see that Kenpachi almost didn't break a sweat, he won because of kendo. Really? I'd love to see Nel putting Nnoitra back to his place, wasted fight as well.

What would have made Arrancar's arc much better would be some SS casualties, I'm not talking Game of Thrones style, but a captain or two dying, stronger Espadas would have been the differential. </TEXT>

The only proof that he has is your breath, that hardly proves anything, maybe you ate some banana candy. A judge can't give you a guilty verdict because he doesn't have enough proof to arrest you, however you are a persona in this trial, the accused, can you prove that you are innocent? You can't, but better than that, you don't have to prove that you are innocent, you just have to prove that you are not guilty. The judge can't say that you are innocent, but from the facts that were gathered the verdict will be not guilty.

	<TEXT> The only possible way to Skyrim to be united would be if Torygg was still alive, he isn't, Skyrim is corrupted, if the Stormcloaks win the war, it will be filled with incompetent Jarls.  Both Riften and Falkreath would be easy preys, luckily, however, the Thalmor invasion would have been stopped by Markarth and Whiterun from the southwest and Windhelm would stop any altmer advance from the southeast.

However, as you said yourself, the number of altmers has decreased, but the thing about mages, and it is something that you often hear is that a minority of altmer was able to overcome a majority of imperial and nords. Now a Skyrim destroyed by a Civil War is easy prey, and the emperorless Imperial City? A demotivated army, a shaken empire, all that against a united faction that can be deadly as it can be swift and they have inside agents everywhere. After the Civil War in Skyrim it is obvious that the Empire will not survive.

And the (future) lore will obviously make an excuse to remove the Dragonborn from the battleground, maybe going to Apocrypha, maybe to Akavir, once again, another reason for the obliteration of the Empire, not necessarily making the altmer the high lords of both Cyrodiil and Skyrim, but to me it is quite clear that, both the Empire and Skyrim will lose the war against the Aldmeri Dominion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both the Imperials on Skyrim and the Stormcloaks have similar military powers, the differential on the scale here is where the Dragonborn lies his allegiance, and even so if we imagine a realistic combat, even with the help of the Dragonborn there will be several casualties. Which means, when the war is over, it doesn't matter if the Empire remained united, or Skyrim had its independence, they will be both weakened, an easy target for the Aldmeri Dominion, the only difference between a long Civil War and one with the influence of the Dragonborn is that the numbers of altmers that will die in the latter will be a bit higher than the former, but they will win the war either way.

Well, at least if the Dragonborn's influence doesn't show up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Empire was weak, there is no doubt in that, also if you consider what some NPCs say on the game Skyrim has a shortage on food and the Empire helps them with that - which makes sense since the harsh climate would make crops hard to bear nice vegetables - check Brandy-Mug Farm where Bolfrida says it is hard to plant since the ground is frozen.

We have first the problem with food, a fight between the Imperials and the Stormcloaks would destroy good crops, specially in Whiterun Hold.

Another matter that has to be brought to attention is the lack of competent Jarls that Ulfric has aapointed, I can only think of Thingvor Silver-Blood and Vignar Gray-Mane. All of the rest are maniacs.

Finally, it is from the interest of the Aldmeri Dominion to have Skyrim start a Civil War and to have Ulfric win it, the empire would grow weaker, making it an easy target for the Dominion and the next step would be Skyrim.

Ulfric should have forged an alliance with Torygg to separate Skyrim from the Empire, the outcome would have been better for both Torygg and Ulfric and Skyrim would have a higher chance to stand against the Aldmeri Dominion. </TEXT>
