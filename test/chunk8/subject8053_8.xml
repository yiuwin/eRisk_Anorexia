	<TEXT> I'm just wondering if it's possible to return a Starbucks gift card for cash. I used an Egift card to pay for it and have the receipt. Seems really unlikely, but i just want to make sure </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was with my friends riding a roller coaster at our amusement park, stupid me wore gym shorts on the ride with my phone in my pocket. During the drop, the phone flew out of my pocket. At that point, i knew it was gone forever. Luckily at the end of the ride, a guy sitting behind us handed me my phone and was like "I caught it mid-air". Guy had ninja reflexes holy moly </TEXT>
