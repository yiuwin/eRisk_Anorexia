	<TITLE> How will I know if it's NV? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-09 06:44:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let me start off by saying that I have an on-going, currently undiagnosed chronic illness that has in the past mimicked NV, including fevers and the awful gastrointestinal upset. I'm in the process of seeing specialists and having tests done to figure it out.
Now, to my current question. I was awakened today by god awful cramps in my bowels and immediately ran to the bathroom, and I've had diarrhea and stomach pain all day. I've had some nausea, but have been able to keep it under control, though I haven't eaten since Tuesday evening cause my bowels were so upset and hurting so badly today. I'm just tired and out of it and have been in bed literally all day. 
Like I said, this has happened before and after a day or two I feel a lot better, but with NV season all around me and literally everyone on my Facebook feed saying they were up sick all night or have it, I'm terrified this isn't one of my normal "episodes", and that I'm going to wake up v*ing or even more ill. 
Is there a way I can tell if it is NV or not? I'm still having some bowel discomfort and a little diarrhea, but haven't had to take anything else for nausea and am actually eating some hard candy right now. I also don't have any fever at the moment either. 
If it is NV, I really hope the worst is over and I'm not gonna have to v*. I'm just so worried, anxious, and scared right now. I haven't been around anyone who has it but I've been in public a lot lately and the only time my hand even comes close to my mouth before I can get home and wash them is when I smoke. 
I'm just rambling now, I apologize. I'm just scared and upset and don't know what to do :(
Edit: Welp, I just had an attack of low blood sugar from not eating (weakness, cold sweat that drenched me yet I felt hot, woozy, my legs felt like jello, my stomach felt raw) so I had to eat some crackers about two hours after I took an anti-emetic :/ It's passing but I'm terrified the crackers will make me v* :( I just wish I could catch a break, ugh!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, try to remember how you even catch it to begin with - ingesting v* or feces particles. I'm positive you weren't even close enough to anything to worry about catching it, it'd be a concern if you were the one who cleaned it up or something in that manner. 
Try to remember there's tons of reasons people get sick, it's not always noro :) 
I have had the same exact thing happen to me back during my junior year and I cried so hard I couldn't breath. I wasn't as aware of how it's transmitted back then, cause that would have calmed me. I know how traumatizing it is, but for my case, it turned out she was really really high and couldn't handle it. It was still awful but I'm actually really good friends with her now, haha! We graduated a few years ago. 
You are going to be fine :) BUT, you do need to eat. Not eating at all makes your stomach feel crappy then add anxiety into the mix, and you're gonna have a bad time :( Try at least something light, please don't starve yourself. 
Just keep practicing good hand hygiene and don't go sticking your hands/fingers in your mouth and all will be okay :) Try to relax and do something to take your mind off of it, it'll help quite a bit :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same thing happened with me when I had a HIDA-scan, the results weren't perfect, but enough to make my surgeon say "Ehh, your symptoms fit, lets take it out anyways." So I trusted him and low and behold, my gallbladder was black when they got in there. It wasn't functioning like it should at all but the scan almost overlooked that somehow. IANAD, so I have no idea how that crap works, haha. 
Anyways, I felt much better after having it removed. No more pain in my upper right quadrant under my rib cage, no more vomiting every night, but a couple years later I did develop a secondary bowel issue due to having it removed. Food just moves through too quickly and I get awful diarrhea. But hey, I can deal with that. 
Best of luck! Hope you feel better!  </TEXT>

If you're 18, is there any way you could look into making an appointment with a psychiatrist or therapist? Your school may have some resources that could be helpful. 
Lastly, if you're ever feeling suicidal or like you want to hurt yourself, PLEASE reach out.

But, why is it that little kids ALWAYS seem like they're the ones catching noro no matter what? It always starts with the little ones then BOOM, everyone around them is sick. I've been doing pretty awesome about being in public for the past couple weeks, but each day is becoming harder and harder for me to want to step foot outside cause I'm terrified of catching it no matter what I do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the reply! :) 
I did not see a specialist after my first lap, as it wasn't causing me as many problems as it is now and the depo + surgery was working for me. It's just been in the past year that it's become a problem, and for some reason every doctor is blaming everything on the Endo cause they can't find anything :/ I'm not exactly sure which method they used for removal, I just realized I was never told or asked, haha. I will ask at my next appointment though. 
My endocrinologist is actually testing me for celiacs and what not, and has spoken of sending me to a gastroenterologist in the near future. So, hopefully that can rule out any other intestinal/gastro issues, or find them. 
But I'm just hoping after my lap they can tell me a little more and they can remove whatever they can. I just don't want to be told I have only two choices or I suffer, when I know there have to be other things that could help me. My gyno even suggested I maybe go to physical therapy for my hip/sciatic nerve pain, which would be something I'm totally willing to try. 
Edit: added words.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello ladies,
I'm 23 and I was diagnosed with stage I Endo in 2009, and had already been on the depo shot for years so after my lap I decided to stay on it, and it has helped up until this year.
I had quite a health crisis in 2013 and I'm still recovering from some of it, but we believe my Endo has become worse, as my symptoms are significantly more severe and nothing is showing up on any scans or in any other tests. 
My pain has become a 10 daily on the pain scale and I'm now having sciatic nerve issues, which my gyno believes is due to the Endo possibly growing around the nerves in that area. My gastro symptoms and the painful sex are unbearable, and ibuprofen just isn't touching it anymore, but I'm too scared to ask for pain pills as it's a massive issue with the doctors around here. So I literally have to deal with it. 
My gyno set up a transvaginal ultrasound for Monday and a follow-up for Friday, but has already told me he thinks I'm due for another lap to go in and take a look and remove what he can. 
But, he also told me that my only choice after surgery is stay on the depo or do Lupron. Now, I know Lupron has been a lifesaver for a lot of women, but I just really don't want to attempt it. I have such bad reactions to new medications and god knows how long it will take the depo to get out of my system cause I've been on it for 8 years. 
I guess I'm rambling, but I just wanted any advice as to what I should do. Is it really just surgery and Lupron? Or what other choices might I have? I'm so lost in all of this and this pain is ruining my life, I can barely function most days.
Any advice or input is greatly appreciated, thank you!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I've actually been in the same boat all week, especially tonight. I've been incredibly stressed, barely sleeping, running ragged with doctors appointments, and after I got home today I ended up with a wicked sinus headache. I hadn't eaten since yesterday afternoon and my stomach was all funny so I was terrified to eat. I finally got the feeling that I *needed* to eat or I'd pass out or get sick. So, I had a cup of ramen and two pieces of toast. My tummy felt a little funny for a little bit but it passed and I laid down in bed with my fianc, took some ibuprofen and Excedrin, and my headache eased up a bit. I actually got hungry for real food, so I put a beef roast on and ran to the store for a few things and came home and had a nice bowl of beef and noodles, again with a piece of toast, haha. (I love my toast) But now my headache is barely there, my stomach feels just fine, I'm not nauseous, and I'm relaxing while catching up on The Walking Dead :) Don't be scared to sleep, you're focusing on your stomach too much and your anxiety is making it that much worse. Just let yourself rest and get the sleep it needs, you'll feel so much better after a good nights rest. Sinus headaches suck ass, but I've never known them to make you v* like a migraine or something would. The medicine you took should help. You're gonna be fine, you got this :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something similar happened to me on Friday. My Mom is disabled and on oxygen 24/7 so leaving the house is a huge task for her, but she had an appointment that afternoon so I took her (I'm her caretaker) and she said she was feeling fine that day, just out of breath. Well, we're in the process of getting her a wheelchair so she has to walk everywhere right now, and she wore these pants that were kinda thick cause it wasn't supposed to be hot. 
Well, low and behold, it's in the upper 80's and pretty warm (fucking Ohio) and by the time we got home, she was pale and flushed, extremely tired, no appetite, and kinda nauseous. My mind automatically reverts to "For fucks sake, it's a stomach bug, I am so screwed." She had breakfast that morning and isn't diabetic so I knew it wasn't a blood sugar issue, and she had a low-grade fever so I was freaking out. She had a couple loose bowel movements and ate a piece of toast, but then got the dry heaves, so I made her lay down and sip on water and take a promethazine, and she went to sleep for a while. 
I spent the entire night freaking the fuck out, sanitizing everything, making myself feel sick from anxiety and paranoia. 
She actually woke up a few hours later and was perfectly fine. I flipped out for no reason. She had gotten overheated and overworked, and it made her sick. 
I guess my point is, your friend sounds like she did the same thing. Being out of shape, drinking, hiking, not eating right, those could all add up to it. It could even be food poisoning, you never know. Everyone's body is so different and reacts to things like exhaustion and stuff like that to different extremes. 
Like /u/ Kutii said, if you and your boyfriend are feeling fine, I honestly wouldn't worry. Try to just distract yourself and remember how you catch that stuff :) 
But I do hope your friend feels better, that sounds like a damn nightmare. She should definitely get checked out if it doesn't start easing up soon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IANAD, but any concerning side effects such as what you're having should definitely be discussed with your pdoc or GP. Try to at least get a hold of a nurse or someone and ask if you should keep taking it or cease until you see your doctor again. I suffer from bipolar I so I know how crappy side effects from mood stabilizers can make you feel, and my pdoc always told me if i have any weird side effrcts not to ignore them. No matter how big or small.

	<DATE> 2014-09-25 07:57:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been prescribed Propranolol since the middle of 2013 after developing paroxysmal tachycardia from hyperthyroidism. 
Hyperthyroidism has since ceased, levels are within normal range, but yet I am stuck with the tachycardia. I'm kind of a medical mystery at this point and am currently seeing specialists who are testing me for adrenal or endocrine issues. 
My question is, are there any risks in prolonged use of beta-blockers? I have (religiously) taken it every day, every six hours, and it's 20mg at a time. If I miss a dose my heart rate climbs near 190BPM and I almost pass out, so until I figure out the issue I can't really stop taking it. I was just wondering the risks, as I would like to speak with my doctor about it. 
Thanks in advance! 
Additional info: I've had x-rays, cat scans, EKG's, too much blood work, I've also spent several nights admitted to the hospital hooked up to heart monitors and everything is normal as far as they can see. Normal rhythms and everything.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Questions about disability. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-25 04:06:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, my pdoc believes it may be time to try and get me put on disability. I'm 23 and suffer from bipolar 1, anorexia nervosa, schizoaffective disorder, severe anxiety, slight agoraphobia, mysophobia, and panic attacks. My quality of life sucks, treatment is going to take a while to even see any kind of effect, and I'm barely functional at this point. I really haven't been functional for almost two years now.
My question is, has anyone here ever been granted disability solely from anything like bipolar disorder or the like? My physical health is incredibly fucked up as well, so I'm seeing medical doctors for that but when it comes down to it, my main problems all stem from mental issues. My physical health is horrible right now, I'm 105lbs. and 5'6", I never go outside so I'm transparent, vitamin and mineral deficient, I'm malnourished and have no body mass, I have caused damage to my heart, have hypoglycemia, and massive digestive issues. I'm seeing medical doctors for that stuff, but it will not get any better until my mental health does. 
If anyone has any advice or experience with this stuff, I'd greatly appreciate any input. I see my pdoc tomorrow afternoon so I'll get as much info as I can from her to be better prepared for all of this.  </TEXT>

Like /u/johnnyodyssey said, you may slightly gag from coughing real hard, but bronchitis itself won't make you v*. Your body usually fights back against that gagging reflex and you'll be fine, don't worry :) 
I hope you feel better soon!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I lost my cousin last week. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My beautiful cousin lost her battle with triple negative breast cancer on September, 18th at 5:45pm. She was 41 years old and lived and loved more in that 41 years than most people do in 80. 
She fought so incredibly hard and never lost her smile. We have countless pictures of her during chemo treatments just laughing and smiling, no matter how bad the pain was or how sick she felt. 
We buried her on Monday and she had a beautiful catholic ceremony. She took comfort in her faith and religion, and was able to plan out her funeral and ceremonial arrangements weeks ago. She declined very quickly, and she was aware of what was coming. 
I learned more from cousin than I think she ever knew. One of the last things she told me was how much she loved me and that she was always right there holding my hand. I learned to smile no matter the circumstance, love with all I've got, quit holding grudges, and face every situation with my head held high. 
I just wanted to thank everyone in this sub for the advice and kind words in my previous posts, you are all such incredibly kind hearted people.
I can only find solace and comfort in knowing my cousin is finally pain free and I hope she's somewhere that cancer never exists. 
Keep fighting, keep smiling, fuck cancer.  </TEXT>
