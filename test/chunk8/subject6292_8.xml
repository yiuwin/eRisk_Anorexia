	<TEXT> Nothing too awful, but my mom and dad got divorced when I was a freshman in high school. We lost the house due to bankruptcy and my two brothers and I moved in with my mom. 
Years later my dad told me that back when they split she begged him to take us. She wanted to go off on her own and do whatever. Explains why she had me watch my youngest brother every night while she hung out with various boyfriends. Still it shocked me to hear that she wanted to pretty much give us up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My husband has expressed jealousy that women can acceptably carry purses too. I wonder how many guys would like to carry them. They are pretty handy for storage, but I keep mine in the car a lot of the time because it's bulky to carry around.  </TEXT>
