	<TEXT> There's a cool trick you can do, it's called tunnel vision. Do not let your mind run everywhere. For example: when you're in class, fuck everything else, focus ONLY on your lesson. Distracting yourself with heaps and heaps of problems can kill your grades pretty quickly. You can and will solve them eventually, one at a time. Just dont let those problems ruin your life more than they already do now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Your mom is just trying her best to do what she think is right, you should be a little more forgiving toward her.
2. It's actually normal for a freshman to slack off and feel like dropping out. I think what you should do now is try your best and go to class, sit next to someone who's completely fascinated by the lesson, and follow the flow.
3. You're already more fortunate than 80% of the gay community by living in such an advance country, an opportunity i wish i had. Meeting someone might not be that hard, apps, going to clubs, or just start looking. You HAVE to know that you can totally figure this shit out, just put in some effort. 
4. Life will just keep throwing shit at you, it's your job to create your own joy and happiness. No one's going to help you, not your mom, not your friends, not your future SO. You now get to decide your own fate.
5. If non works, then yea, drop out, stay at home, be depressed, and blame others for your misery. 

Edit: Fun fact: Gay people in my country usually joke about Canada being the heaven gay people go to when they die </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol no. The dating pool is non-existing since my whole country is homophobic as fuck, no one wants ( or dare ) to come out . Gay bar and Grindr isn't a thing. And people still get hurt just because they're gay. I am dying for a real relationship, so fucking tired of everyone around me dating and flirting and doing things that i should have been able to do but am not because it's "wrong".

Sorry for being so pessimistic, but i think i have the right to be when almost all my right to love as a human is taken from me because of some stupid people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a great video about the problems of "mind body". It explains how our physical appearence rarely convey the real-self that we know we are in our mind. For example, a huge tough scary looking guy might inside think himself as a soft and caring person.

I think the "gay voice" you are mentioning is a tool for people to show a more feminine side of them. It always feels good to be the person you think you are in your mind . So personally i don't think the voice is wrong or weird. it's exactly the same as a simple plain shirt a minimalist would buy, or that square glass you wear to look a little bit more nerdy. 

We, of all people should know about the identity struggle our community is going through. It always helps to be a little bit more understanding and empathetic. So don't be mad at our bros just because of their voices, will you ?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, i am looking to get into diablo 3 and currently have a few questions, would really appreciate the answers from you guys.

* Are stats a big aspect from loots ? Or do we just look for that specific legendary and ignore everything else ?

* Does combat feel fluid and fun to play in your opinion ? I heard Diablo 3 combat is fantastic

* This may sound stupid but is there a gambling system in game ? Like spending earned currency to have a chance to get something good.

* How steep is the learning curve ? How long would it take for one to start enjoying endgame content ?
* Is the game well optimized ? I am still having ptsd from the atrocious performence of PoE

	<TITLE> Why are people so against the concept of a "cure" for homosexuality ? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-19 15:43:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So most of the posts i read that involved "changing sexual orientation" always get downvoted to oblivion. Why is it so important for the gay community that the world must not even think about curing homosexuality. Yes it may be a mild insult to your identity, but what about those who aren't fortunate enough to live in a first world country. People get humiliated, imprisioned, or even killed daily just for being gay. A fix would be life changing for them, and would not harm you in anyway.

Edit: One would argue that changing the political view on the matter would be better. But is it really ? America just elected a fucking clown to become its next president. Do you really think even less developed country than America would suddenly get shit together and demonstrate logic ?

Edit2: You can see it as "a change for homosexuality" if the word cure offend you.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I can't remember anything memorable from my experience for the last 3-4 months. I just log in, do some dailies, fractals, weekly guild event, maybe gathering and log out. I never expect anything cool or exciting to happen, same reward, same loot, everytime.

In other games like Path of Exile, there's a sense of excitment because you know there's always a chance of getting some really valuable drops. You're bound to get that stimulating moment every once in a while, a reward for your time.

Gw2 is a great game, but man does it get boring after a while. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Every piece of media i enjoy daily has been in English. My writing and listening is alright ( i hope ). I can easily form sentences in my head, differentiate all the accents, and yet, i can't speak the language. I know how to express a sentence to sound natural because i use it so much, but it feels weird to say all the words out low. I'd stutter and struggle to find an accent to speak in. Words wouldn't come out clearly and no one can understand me.

It feels horrible to not be able to say anything to my friends, every single time we hang out has been me being silent the whole time, because i literally can't speak. Please help </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-01-04 15:04:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Looking for that specific ring you looted can be painful when your inventory is full, an inventory search would help a lot. And for the search syntax, here are some of my suggestions:

* **[item]**, will only show the item of that kind, not the exact string search. (  **[gem]**, **[currency]**, **[div]**, **[map]** etc... ). Right now only *"currency"* will work
* **![item]** will exclude all the items of that type
* **[item]_string** will perform a string search but only for the item type.  ( for example: **[ring]_chaos res**,  **[unique]_cloak**) 

* (and also **![item]_string** )



* Combine **[item]** with available syntax. For example **[essence]_tier:X**
