	<TITLE> Legal problem in Spain. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello,

I received a call yesterday from a friend who is in a very bad/dangerous situation and whose freedom is in danger. She's Spanish and I don't know if any of you could help me understand if there is any way to help her. I would much appreciate any advise.

Edit: more information.

My friend is from real life, not the internet. She lived with me for a few months last year and I get to know her. She has an illness that apparently doctors can't exactly find out. She was diagnosed with stomach paresthesia and IBS in the beginning of the last year but prior to that she was diagnosed with anorexia. The problem is that she is being held into psychiatric custody in an eating desorder private center with a court order. Long story short she claims that she doesn't have anorexia but food phobia related to the pain caused by eating. I really think she's telling the truth because I'm familiar with eating desorders and even while people is use to lie, she really seemed to be in extreme pain every time she ate and a lot of other different actitudes towards the food that are uncommon for an anorexic. I'm not a doctor and I can't be sure of course, but I think that she deserves, at least, the benefit of the doubt and the right to choose the place where she's going to be treated. This girl was placed in this facility where she's forced to eat large quantities despite of being in pain and they systematically disregard her cries for medical help. Anyone believes her, neither does her family and I know this place very well and they play with people dispair and fear to get money from private patients and from the government. Right now she's in a leave for Christmas at her parent's house and she comes back tomorrow. Before her leave, the last day, her psychologist told her that she had two options, one was that her parents accepted to send her to therapeutical apartments (this is a modality of internament that they have where you go to live in an apartment supervised 24/7 and that costs 3000 euros per month) or that if her parents refuses she would be put in incapacity and be held inside the center for years. She was literally threatened with that and she's terrified with coming back tomorrow. I know she can be lying but I know her, she's a sweet and clever girl who's been through hell for the past 4 years and anyone believes her and anyone even listen to her. Her parents are completely blinded by the doctors and by the pain they've been through, and I would like, at least, to know if she has any legal way to decide where she's going to be treated or if she can leave the center. The main problem is that she claims that as she was diagnosed with anorexia in this place any doctor take her seriously about her stomach condition. I can assume that this is true because I've witnessed how she's ignored, even I've seen doctors walk over her when she's crying on the floor. I've talked to her parents and told them that and they say this is because her actitude with the doctors is not the right one. She wrote me an email with the information (more or less what I've summarized here) and I tried to locate a 24 hour lawyer that maybe could tell me something today before she goes to the center, but I couldn't find anyone. In the other hand, she doesn't have family beside her parents and any money of her own.

Thanks for reading.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello.

Thank you for your answer. I got a pimple yesterday and I stopped the retinol because is the only new thing I have. I hope I don't start to break out... I plan on patch testing the new things. I'll do that, use the hada labo in the morning and alternate the retinol with vitamin c and niacinamide, can I use the niacinamide in the morning? </TEXT>

I told her my routine and she told me to cut the oil cleansing and add the Acniben repair. Nothing really about the rest of the things I use, she said the same, that perhaps I was using too many things but that in either case, nothing seemed harmful except the Albolene that I was using as mae up remover, she told me to use micellar water instead that is what I'm doing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have very oily acne prone skin and this year I've used Biore Watery Essence, Biore Perfect Face Milk, Naruto Tea Tree Oil Sunscreen, LRP Anthelios XL, Heliocare Oil Free 360 Sunscreen and The Face Shop Oil Control Sunscreen with Tea Tree Oil and aloe Vera. My favourite was Biore Watery Essence but is not water and sweat proof and it has too much alcohol. Just now I've found my HG sunscreen: Isdin Fusion Water SPF 50 sunscreen. Is like Biore texture, very light, no white cast (I'm darked oilve skin) and in 2 minutes it dries completely.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello,

I'm a 32F with oily acne-prone skin. I have found a routine that doesn't break me out and is improving my skin. I'm mainly concerned about PIH and acne scars. I went to the dermatologist last week and she prescribed me retinol (Biretix gel) that I added to my routine. I'm waiting for a few products from the ordinary that I want to introduce gradually, but I'm very confused about the order. Can you help me? It would be much appreciated.

**AM:**

* Clean my face with Clarisonic and Apivita Purifying gel with propolis and lime.
* Hada labo super hyaluronic acid lotion
* Biretix gel
* Isdin Fusion Water Sunscreen SPF 50
* Sometimes Clarins Ever Matte Foundation

**PM:**

* Remove make up with Avene Micellar Water
* Cleanse with Clarisonic and Apivita purifying gel with propolis and lime.
* Klairs preparation supple toner (wait 5 min)
* Cosrx Blackpower liquid (Wait 20 minutes)
* Hada labo super hyaluronic acid lotion
* Biretix gel
* Isdin Acniben repair gel with a few drops of tea tree oil
* Sometimes DUAC gel (BP) when I have pimples.

My new products are:

* The ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
* The ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23%
+ HA Spheres 2%

I'm also running out of Blackhead power liquid and I was thinking to switch to a BHA, which one could be good for my skin type? (I've tried Paula's choice BHA 2%).

	<TEXT> Hello,

Today I went to the dermatologist and I talked to her about my worry for my acne scars. She said they are not too deep, and recommend me a treatment called Nanopore turbo roller instead of laser (that I asked for). I've just checked in internet and is somehow a professional dermarolling developed by the Spanish laboratory "Sesderma". Here's a [link](http://www.dralourdesaloy.com/nanopore-turbo-roller/).

In the other hand, she prescribed me a topical treatment in the meanwhile until I decide if I do the Nanopore. Is a gel called "BiRetix gel" retinol based. I wanted you opinion: here's is the [link](https://farmaciajimenez.com/catalogo/sin-marca/biretix-gel-50-ml/) Sorry is in Spanish. I wanted to know if any of you have tried it and if you can tell me where can I use it in my routine or if I should skip the BHA while using it.

Thank you in advance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My skin is very oily and I have hormonal acne and PIH due to the cysts. I've seen a derm and she prescribed me some things that I'm combining with others I've found and tried for the last months. So far, the things that aren't expensive and are improving the general look of my face and controlling oiliness are:

* Avene micellar water (as make up remover)
* Alepo soap. You can buy it in natural shops and it helps to keep the oil under control. I wash my face at night with it.
* Aztec healing clay mask with apple cider vinegar. This is so great. I use it once a week and add some drops of Tea Tree Oil and it leaves my skin very smooth and helps with the occasional pimple.
* Tea tree oil pure. I use this mixed with masks and moisturizer. Is strong so just one drop sometimes stings, but is worth it.
* Isdin Acniben repair. The only moisturizer that I find suits me and doesn't break me out. Is gel texture, very nice.
* Sr Skincare Vitamin C Serum 10%. I use it in the morning after washing my face. I feel my PIH is better but I've just bought The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% [here](https://www.victoriahealth.com/product/Vitamin-C-Suspension-23-HA-Spheres-2/12197) if you want to check, the concentration is higher and the brand seem to be serious, I don't know how it will go though...
* Hada Labo Hyaluronic Acid Lotion. I bought it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hada-Labo-Gokujyn-Hyaluronic-Lotion/dp/B000FQUGXA) It last forever and is waterish. I read in a redditor's blog, [this one](https://simpleskincarescience.com/get-rid-of-acne/), that it had helped him a lot and I've been using it for a month, no break outs and really, my face is much better with my new routine. Btw that blog has a lot of good tips.
* I also use Cosrx BHA blackhead Power liquid as exfoliator and Klairs preparation supple toner to balance my skin ph, those are more expensive though. When I have a cyst or a pimple I use DUAC, it was prescribed by my derm and you need a prescription, I was using Epiduo before and it dried out my face, so the derm told me that is the most gentle BP formulation.

Good luck, btw, I'm a girl not "sir" lol.

	<TEXT> No, he doesn't have Crohn's or colitis. We live in South Spain, so plenty of sun here, yet he's mostly indoors nowadays because of the foot pain. My main concern is that his doctor ordered him the transfusions (by the way, he's getting the vitamin d12 shots too) but not further tests, so I want me or my mum to go to speak to the doctor and ask him for further information, my father just accepts what they say to him and thinks there's nothing to do. What tests could they do to know the source of the low RBC? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello,

This question is about my father. He's 65 years old, diabetic (type 2) and a little overweight, not much, about 5kg. He's a heavy smoker and one year and a half ago he was hospitalized because of Q Fever for a month. He was somehow find until then, but since then, he's been having all kind of medical issues, specially severe foot pain and tiredness, because he can't sleep due to the foot pain. Last week he had his last blood panel and he has low levels of vitamin d3 and b12 and very low red cells counting. He has been ordered to get three blood transfusions this week. I don't have his results here with me, but I'm very worried because his doctor seems to be treating the symtoms but not the root of them. I know he has bad habits, he's super sedentary and I think he's getting depressed because of everything that's happening to him. I want to help him, but I don't know how, he doesn't want to stop smoking or cutting carbs, that are mainly the things that I propose to him. I just wanted to ask you if maybe he can have some condition that he's not aware of and his doctor is missing, at least, to ask him to get checked.

Thanks. </TEXT>
