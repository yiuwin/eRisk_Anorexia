	<TEXT> You can. But if you keep only the mid and low range ones, you never get them as a sourcing mission. So you can concentrate ONLY on sourcing and selling top end cars. If you keep only one unique version of each vehicle and don't go over 32, you can basically only source the ones you want to drive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MC contracts, or "Wall missions", as they're sometimes called, are lobby-wide. So in theory, in a public lobby people will be claiming these jobs like it's the classified section of a paper. So they have to be completed before a new one comes in. And they're on a cool-down timer so you can't grind them that hard. 

The good thing is they reset per session so you can always keep jumping.  </TEXT>

In order to keep things fair, this shouldn't be the case. 
Obviously you can't have the reverse where players in the DM go off other the lobby's radar because people would abuse that. 

What they should do is turn your 1v1 DM into a mini "Gang Attack" where other players cannot kill you and you cannot kill other players. 

What else can R* do to make the 1v1 DM more fair? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought of an idea that players should be able to sell their cars to other players through an auction system. You go to the Simeon's used car place (the interior of which is already modeled) go to a kiosk and pull up vehicles that are on the auction block. You put in a bid after looking at pictures and descriptions and pay a fee. If you win the auction (say 48-hours IRL) you get a notification that you won and to stop by Simeon's to pick it up. Once you get it you can change the colors but nothing else (?)

The sale of your own used car is basically 65% of retail value (same as currently) plus 10% of what the new buyer paid. Or something like that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a bunch of playlist that consists of legitimate races and DMs that I made a couple years ago. Each playlist has one created race or DM that has a specific launch location strategically located around LS. 

I have some playlists that launch near Rhino spawns. Some that launch near my apartments. And one that launches near Zancudo. 

Here's my Zancudo race http://rsg.ms/2dd13ad PS4 feel free to grab this if you like. 

It's actually a pretty fun race, I think. But if you launch this race and then back out, you spawn right near the rock where you can jump the fence near the underground tunnel. I don't know if this trick still works. I thought they patched it a year or so ago. I have it tried it in forever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I get tired of the CEO stuff I'll probably do this. It sounds like a lot of fun. I used to do way more PvP (normal auto-aim) and had begun to grow a small network of GTA friends (non-real life friends.) GTA would always put us in each other's lobbies even when we were just doing our own separate things. But when we'd notice "so-and-so got killed by ___" on the notifications, we'd immediately rush to to other's aid. More than a couple occasions, we would unintentionally run off the entire lobby and it would just be 8-10 of us in there. Those were good times. 

What you described sounds reminiscent of those days. I wouldn't mind trying that out st some point. 

Are you on console or PC? If console, what are your aim sensitivity settings? I've been tooling around with those settings recently.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually this is old bullshit with a new twist I haven't seen before. 

So after completing a MC Wall Mission with no hiccups, I get a call from Malc offering the usual congratulatory message to conclude the mission. Then I immediately get a call from LJT. 

LJT says my weed farm is being attacked by The Lost. (So much for premium security system right?) He says if I don't hurry they'll take all my product. So I hop on my Gargoyle and since I'm not too far, I keep one eye on the "Product Remaining" progress bar in the lower right of the screen and have decent hopes that I won't lose too much. The bar doesn't move and I arrive on scene.

I arrive to find two groups of The Lost taking cover behind their Burrito vans and just blast them to smithereens with a couple of grenades. No big deal. Clean up the survivors and I'm done. 

But then the game says to prepare to defend against reinforcements! Ok cool! A gunfight! Just what I love -- keeping in mind what people have said about these defense missions being a one-life proposition, I put on a super heavy armor, make sure my health is full (it is,) and I take cover. 

A couple of large red circles appear on the edges of my minimap. I look around and manage to dispatch the onslaught of bikers. There's a counter on my screen's lower right that says "remaining waves" and it sits at "3"

So I find a new spot to wait for the three remaining waves of bad guys but nothing happens. Everything is quiet. No one comes. I wait, and I drive around, and I shoot random pedestrians and cars to try to trigger something. Nothing happens. Then I notice that my product is being stolen. The "remaining product" bar is down a full 1/3. 

Great. It's glitched. No one else is coming to attack but the game thinks I'm having trouble killing them all and is still draining my product. I pull the plug on the game to reset it and when I log back in, all my weed product is gone. My supply is untouched (3 bars) but my product has vanished.

Wth

The amount of bullshit I experience doesn't amount to enough for me to quit playing. But this was a new twist that pushed all the right buttons for me to be super frustrated. End rant, I guess. Back to the drawing board! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they fixed this now but I remember once I went to pay $250 for my impounded car, just for kicks. 

The game said I don't have enough money (cuz I had nothing in wallet, everything was banked.)

So I withdrew $500 from my bank to my wallet and tried again. The gate opened, but unnoticed the game took money from my BANK instead of the $500 I had on hand. 

It's so retarded. Not sure if this is still the case now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's my take on the issue, for what it's worth. 

 people who say griefers are out for cheap kills because of their KD: how do you know that's why they're griefing? I highly doubt taking away the KD stat will change those players' behavior. They do it because they like it. 

 KD is NOT a useless or bad stat: it's just a statistic that tracks your behavior in the game. It's as useless/useful as "cops killed" or "near misses" stat tracking. It's just a number so you can know it. It doesn't matter WHY you want to know it or track it. It's just data. Data, by definition, is completely neutral. 

 just a hypothesis, but I'd bet if there WASN'T a KD column in your GTA stat sheet, people would be shredding GTA for not keeping track of kills/deaths in a crime simulator. 

 lastly, players who complain about KD stat generally have a negative KD. That's neither here nor there. Just an observation. Like the KD stat itself, you can take that observation how you will.

	<TEXT> That was the bulk of my money making this time around, for sure. I basically only did I/E when I got bored of contact missions. 

Primarily, I did my Crystal Clear Out mission. I just grinded it (ground it?) The math on double payout basically broke down like this:

It's a 2.5 minute mission. Grab a Buzzard (just a like .1 mile away from your spawn point) blow up three groups of Vagos. That's it. 

I basically would set a timer or just guesstimate about 4-minutes before I finish the mission. That gives me peak dollar/minute because of the way payout scales on a curve. 

If I do my playlist of 5x Crystal Clear Out, I stand to make $204,000 in about 25 minutes (including load times.) That's like $580,000/hour. Play for three or four hours and that's like +$2,300,000! Making huge amounts of money was so easy.

The other thing I did a lot was go semi AFK. If you let the mission go to its payout max at 15-minutes, you're making $40,800 solo. If you don't touch the controller except for four times an hour for about two minutes each time, you're still making $160,000 just doing other things around the house. [I talk about it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/67ew5g/i_made_204000_while_watching_nba_playoffs_sort_of/)

One redditor called it the halcyon days. That term has never been more applicable for GTAO!

	<TEXT> Depends on what you mean by "worthwhile"

I mean I have coke, meth, and weed. And full supply and product deliveries of all of these can be done in one play session (YMMV) and you'd earn like +$600,000. Basically set it up, go do races or CEO work, make money, come back afterwards and leave the whole session with over $1M or $1.25M.

I'd be happy with that. And in san fiero, you might have to rebuild your Reputation Points up from nothing, but in LS you're still a big shot. I'd be ok with that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my experience the solo ones are normally in the 16-20k range. (Double that isn't bad.) The group ones are more in the $30k range. 

But they usually take 15-30 minutes to complete. It won't pay like he recent contact missions but they're pretty fun </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a crate retrieval mission do a weird thing. Not so much a bug but a map issue.

I did one where I arrived and need to kill the thieves. 

It was a one-crate delivery so there was only on guy (we were near the horse race track)

He ran, up a flight of stairs when I shot him with a Buzzard missile. He dropped the package but it got glitches under the map. Like it was under the stairs but I couldn't get to it. 

I changed sessions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do my car shipments 98% with cargobob with 99% perfect undamaged deliveries. I always had one though. (Even before they were purchasable at Warstock. RIP, SP to Online glitch.)

If you damage your vehicles like ~$2000 on average per car, round trip, it would take you about 900 deliveries to pay for the Cargobob.

If you damage ~$5000 in a round trip, it would take about 360 deliveries to pay for the Cargobob. 

Personally, I love the CB and the fun you can have with it in missions as well as in freemode.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only if you feel like it! I wouldn't burden anyone with such tedium if it were up to me. If you want to track, you're welcome to. I'd be fascinated by your results, for sure.

But I think the conclusion to my findings is that doing 3-crates is more $/hour but singles isn't as far behind as most people think. It's definitely not 1/3 of the $/hr than 3-crates, like intuition would tell you. 

So if you're feeling particularly casual, I'd say do single or double crates. If you're in the grinding mood, do three. </TEXT>
