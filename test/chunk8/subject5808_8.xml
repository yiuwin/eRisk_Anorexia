	<TEXT> Does anyone have any pro tips for weening off technology? 

I've found myself a bit of a slave to my phone, I got angry with someone today and shut it off, that lasted about 20 minutes before I turned it back on.. 

I've been considering going to a non smart phone maybe? Just checking all my socials after work each day, has anyone had much luck with that sort of stuff? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This really great girl named Crystal. She made moves on me in elementary and I still thought girls were gross because you know, kids. Then we lost contact in high school but I never forgot about her. Then when I was 20 or so I spoke to a mutual friend of ours and found out she was back in the area. We met up to hang not too weeks later. She was still very beautiful and after a few dates we started being partners, but not boyfriend/girlfriend... which for some reason bothered me. So after a year of hookups with her, i moved on. I've been married and have had a relationship after my marriage but I won't forget her ever...

She's married now and I'm single. I wish I could have another chance with her but it doesn't look likely. She truly will be my one who got away.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate that so much. I had a date planned with a girl and it was all going really well and then boom, unmatch.

She didn't even have the courtesy to be like "Oh hey, so I don't think this is really going anywhere, is it cool if I unmatch you?"

That would have been better than it just coming out of left field.  </TEXT>

I can't say I'm much better though, I can't get myself into any kind of relationship at the moment as I'm so busy with the band. But I feel like that might be a legitimate excuse to not date at all...  </TEXT>
