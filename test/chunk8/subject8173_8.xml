	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> PwInsider Elite Audio/Mike Johnson reported that going forward the TNA Creative team will be Jeff Jarrett as Executive Producer/Head of Creative with Dutch Mantell and Scott D'Amore underneath him.

They are also looking into hiring a script writer who can write a format for the shows.

The producers helping backstage will be Abyss, Jeremy Borash, and Rockstar Spud.

He said he's not even sure if Drew Galloway has been offered a new deal by the company, calling them bat-shit crazy not too. He also said that are still in talks with Matt and Jeff Hardy about new deals but there is a lot going into that as far as the Broken Universe and it not really being in the Jarrett/Mantell wheelhouse of booking. </TEXT>
