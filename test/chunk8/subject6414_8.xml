	<TEXT> Well, your current partner sees something in you. You might not see it, but she does. Perhaps some introspection can help you find the answer. Or you can just ask her yourself.

Anyway, I think the average dick size is like 6 inches, so your not like far beneath the charts. Besides, size isn't everything. Could you elaborate on what you meant by your dick not working? Do you use porn, by any chance? Problems like premature ejaculation and death grip can result from excessive masterbation, and I'm wondering if this might be the case for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way I see it, if there's a brick wall at the end of the tunnel, you blow it the fuck up. Look, there's nothing wrong or naive with wanting a good, happy life. Happiness is the end we all aim for, right?

I can understand the frustration of grinding your wheels. Maybe this is a bad example, but when I had really bad acne, I tried dozens of different of medications, everyday hoping this would be better than the last. And yes, I really did feel like giving up at times. Many times I did and just stopped caring. Or tried to stop caring, anyway But tenacity payed off and years later I'm beginning to heal. 

Why are you having trouble in your daily life? Are you unmotivated or depressed? I believe that were all capable of change for the better, one simply needs to apply himself. But if you don't feel the motivation to change, that's where I'd start.

	<TEXT> I really wish I could help you. I understand what your going through, to some degree, having suffered through depression and loneliness. You obviously have it much worse than I did though. For me I felt like I was walking through the middle of an abyss. You feel like your drowning, which has got to be worse.

I guess my advice would be to hold out until you can get insurance and see someone. But having been in a similar position myself, that's not easy. Everyday is slow and painful and meaningless. I'm not sure how I pulled through, I wish you the best that you can too.

Though I'm not 100% familiar with the site, it might be worth looking at GoFundMe to raise money before your insurance is set up. Just a thought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I'm just like you. Never had a gf, never kissed someone, never even held hands. Yeah, I have/had friends of the opposite gender, even got playful/flirty with them, but no one ever looked to develop a serious intimate relationship with me. And that's what I've always longed for. Not for many casual friends, just one person I could connect wholly to. Just someone I could hug at the end of the day, ya know?

To be frank with you, I don't know why I hold out hope that one day I will meet that SO. I guess the biggest reason is age; I'm still 17, still got plenty of time and all that. I have other goals to pursue, even if does hurt not to have someone with me on my journey. 

I mean, there's billions of people on this planet, so statistically there are people out there who I can connect to. I mean, numbers don't exactly make me feel better, but there is some hope in that, I suppose.

So, yeah. If I were you I wouldn't raise the white flag just yet! Many people don't meet there SO until there's 20s, sometimes even later. I'd like to think that if there is somebody out there, she's probably worth the wait. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, your beginning to sound more and more like me! I use to (and still do) struggle maintaining long conversations with another person. I found that there were two reasons for this. The first was that people would talk to me about topics I had no interest or knowledge in. People would talk this video game, football, gossip, etc., which I'm not interested in at all. Once I started meeting and talking to people who shared interests like mine, I began to have things to say, and could actual be a part of the conversation. 

The second reason was largely due to my lack of practice. Conversation is a skill, and I just didn't have much experience in it. By pushing myself outside my comfort zone I began to get better at conversing, even in topics I didn't really care for.

So don't say your helpless. If I could do it, well, anybody could! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What about your personality do you find ugly? I do agree with you that nature plays a big role in our personality; however, I believe nurture is also very important. I've seen people who changed who they were and how they acted. I myself have managed to become a more extroverted and friendly, though I still stay true to my more quiet introspective personality. I think change is a possibility for all, to some extent. Even physical beautiful can be improved upon, which is also something I managed to make some improvements in. Though I don't know your personal situation, I'm sure you can change for the better (if you need to), and I can try to help you if you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why do you have to beat your brother in terms of looks? Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Good looks is your brother's strength. I'm sure you have strengths that your brother doesn't have.

As for getting girls, understand that not all women want a man solely on looks. Looks are important, but personality, money, common interests, etc are also important. So the girl you sorted dated was shallow and didn't like you as a person. That's her loss, not yours. You deserve someone better. 

As an aside, in what way does your brother look better. Do you mean facial complexion, body composition, both? Are you unattractive, or is your brother just a little bit better than you? Because attractiveness can be improved to some extent. </TEXT>

You said you wanted to be a popular artist making lots of money. And while its not a bad dream to have, generally speaking, being popular means you have to conform to what other people want (to some extent). If you don't want to this, it might be time to reassess your dreams and goals. Why do I want to be popular and rich? Why am an artist? Is being an artist really for me? These are the sorts I'd probably be asking myself. </TEXT>
