	<TEXT>  caw of some kind, but nothing. Also, I saw one fly my entire trip. One fly! And It was tiny! (I named him Gerald) Literally every American I met was the nicest person I have ever met. Everyone was so helpful, even the ones I wasn't paying for a service or anything. I didn't meet one rude American, which is nice, considering the world seems to have this idea that America is filled with assholes. Finally, your seagulls are like twice the size of Australian seagulls. Fuck your seagulls. I'm not feeding my fish and chips to your fucking seagulls. They can fuck right off mate!

Bless his heart. He thinks Toronto is America. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's worth mentioning what is in my opinion the greatest individual sports rivalry of all time, which is Ali vs. Frazier. They were very different men but both of equal skill. They each had a boxing style as different from one another as their personalities were. I think it spoke a lot about black american culture and still has relative implications today. </TEXT>
