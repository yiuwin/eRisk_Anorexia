	<TEXT>  I studied for around 200 for a semester (so 2000 for 5 years). I guess I understand now why the top point why Germany is among the most livable countries in the world is its "almost" free education (besides health care).

It is more of a question of how education is paid for. In the US, for post-high school education, students and their parents are expected to directly carry a lot of the burden for education costs. State schools here cost about $10k/year in tuition; private schools can cost upwards of $40k/year (for reference, this is something of a recent development; I went to school in 2003-2007 at Vanderbilt and tuition was about $28k ostensibly).

There's a few caveats, though; first off, scholarships. I only graduated with $12k in debt after going to Vanderbilt, which is one of the best universities in the world. I paid $28k/year in tuition, and got $25k/year in scholarships. Most private schools have major financial aid programs; most people don't pay the full cost of tuition.

Secondly, there's the fact that in Germany, education is subsidized by the state. This means that rather than your education being "almost free", it is simply being charged in a different way - namely, by taxing you more. This means that everyone in Germany has to pay for college, even if they themselves don't go to college. German income  tax rates are 6 percentage points higher than they are in the US, and capital tax rates are 20 percentage points higher. That's on top of a 19% VAT. The US has no federal VAT at all; some states (like the one I live in) don't even have VATs.

Thirdly, Americans are considerably richer than Germans - we earn more and keep more of our income.

As they say, there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How profound. Obviously, but then you can't buy it when the game comes out. Some people like to do that. So those people are left with two bad choices.

Here's the thing: buying a game at release is always a bit of a gamble. Reviews or no, there's a lot that goes unseen and unknown at launch which comes out over a month or so to follow.

I just don't buy anything at launch. If you buy a game at launch without reading any reviews, that's your problem. Many people don't even read reviews.

My sympathy for people who go into things blind is somewhat limited.

 No, I understood your point, I just don't care. I don't give half a flying shit about whether "everyone is on the same footing." Why should I care whether Joe Blog gets to release his half-assed "review" at the same time as IGN or US Gamer? What I care about is that several reasonably trustworthy outlets, ideally a few dozen, are able to give reasonably comprehensive reviews of the product before launch day.

I don't really care about any individual reviewing source other than Zero Punctuation, and I don't go to ZP for serious reviews, I go there because it is amusing.

I don't buy games on launch day, so gaming companies not releasing prerelease review copies doesn't affect me at all.

I mean, if you wait six months, you can often buy them for less.

Why is it important to even buy a game at release? Are you out of other things to play? I've got hundreds of games I haven't even touched.

 They aren't misleading any consumers.

Of course they are. Posting a 0 score based on "we are butthurt because we didn't get a review copy" has no purpose other than to mislead customers. Why would you post a 0 score? The sole goal is to mislead people who aren't paying attention!

I mean, that's just reality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Felons are vastly more likely than the general population to commit a crime. Most people aren't felons. As long as you can find a non-felon to do the job, why not hire the non-felon?

That's why people with felony convictions have a hard time getting jobs - the combination of risk and the fact that there are lots of other people who they can hire instead.

Generally speaking, this means that felons are only going to really get hired if there's a large price discount (i.e. the felon is cheap to hire) or if they literally can't find anyone else who will take the job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  No, the current policy definitely does hurt consumers, because it means that consumers that want to buy the game on day one cannot do so with as much knowledge about the product as possible.

If you don't feel that you have good enough information, you shouldn't buy.

 If reviewers have enough time to fully explore the game before the game's launch, then they can provide a fair and comprehensive review of it, and consumers can read those reviews to determine whether the game has lived up to the marketing. If reviewers only get the game with too little time to complete it before launch, then they cannot provide such information to the public, and therefore the public would either have to wait until more complete reviews are out, or purchase the product on limited information. Neither of these situations is ideal for the consumer.

The reviewers are never going to provide complete information at launch. It *can't* happen for multiplayer games or games with servers, but even for other games, how long is "long enough"?

 Game companies can't just send out review copies to anyone claiming to be a "journalist" because they have a blog, otherwise everyone would do that and no games would be sold. 

I don't think you understood my point. Established players want to continue to receive early copies because it gives them a competitive advantage. Thus, they are the people who get most butthurt over not getting advance copies.

If you're not established, though, the other reviewers losing out on early reviews means that everyone is on even footing.

 So long as they hand out a reasonable amount of copies to established journalists, there is a reasonable spread of opinions about the game.

There is no requirement that they do so.

 The consumers benefit more from having curated, comprehensive, and timely reviews of the game than they do from having everything on a "level playing field" with Joe Blog.

What makes you think that? Video game reviewers mostly don't have any special background or expertise.

 But if these are the major players in the review space, so it would reflect poorly on them if their scores were ignored like that.

Why would it reflect poorly on them? Any company engaging in such obviously and deliberately misleading practices should be ignored. "I gave it a 0 but will change my score in a week to the real score" means that 0 score has absolutely no meaning whatsoever. Penalizing scores for reasons apart from the game being good or bad is anti-consumer, because it leads to misleading information. In fact, the goal here is to deliberately distribute misleading information.

What sort of idiot wouldn't ignore scores from a company which deliberately gives out fake scores as a matter of policy?

 Even if Metacritic did choose to ignore those scores, by leaving them out entirely the entire scoring mechanism would be thrown into chaos, since it would have way fewer data points, and from less reliable sources.

If you're giving out fake scores, you're not a reliable source. </TEXT>

To prove vehicular manslaughter, you have to prove that the victim was killed by the person in question. If you don't have evidence that the victim was alive when they were run over (because the previous incident was probably fatal), then it is hard to press charges.

	<TEXT> I suspect it is "97% of them are of primarily European descent", which is probably true. IIRC the average "mestizo" is something like 2/3rds European in Mexico.

It also should be noted that a lot of the original Argentinian colonists came from Southern Europe, where people have naturally darker skin tones than northern Europeans.

 Why even distinguish races if you're going to call Iraqis White?

The five big population groupings are Indo-Europeans (which includes Europe, the part of Russia with people in it, North Africa, the Middle East, India, and South Asians are about 50-50 Indo-European and East Asian), East Asians, sub-Saharan Africans, Australonesians, and Amerindians. The problem with "white" is that there's no clear border to "whiteness"; skin tones steadily get darker as you go from the polar regions towards the equator. From a genetic standpoint, the Indo-European populations are all more closely related to each other than they are to other population groups. This isn't really surprising if you look at, say, the facial/skeletal structure of Indians; while they have darker skin, their faces are not structured that different from European faces.

Many people from the Middle East and North Africa have light skin. I mean, [these are a bunch of Afghan kids.](http://contest.afghanistanmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/AFGHAN-PEOPLE-3355S-002.JPG) The three kids in the foreground you'd never identify as Middle-Eastern if they walked by wearing clothes normal for Europe/the US. </TEXT>

Another thing worth noting: a lot of people probably stopped playing hard mode after they won one game in it. I didn't (and had probably an 80-90% win rate in it) but I'm sure a lot of people did.

Expert and legendary's very low win rates are probably because almost no one played them "regularly", it was probably almost all achievement hunting. I quit after 8 runs or so as I got the achievement for expert; I could have probably brought up my long-term win rate in that mode but that would require me to keep playing it, and I was pretty much done with the mode by that point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  No, a lot of games really try to focus purely on the story.

RPGs are by their very nature games. If it isn't a game, it isn't really an RPG. Moreover, there are competitive story-based games, like The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen.

 That's why you have multiple damage dice, that's why you have AC, it's all leftover from earlier games.

Original D D actually used d6s for most monster damage, for instance. AC is nothing more than "difficulty of hitting", which is a common thing across almost all RPGs with combat - either there's AC that the attacker rolls against, or there's something that the defender rolls against to dodge (or both). This is extremely common.

Indeed, not all wargames even have "chances of hitting"; RTS games like Starcraft have auto-hits, for instance.

 You see aspects of D D design that purposefully throw a spanner into the GM-player relationship and that doesn't exist in other games.

Such as?

 Moreover, there has been a trend towards more narrative-based games that are exclusively about the building of a story, not about the challenge, becoming more popular.

Those have been common for a long time. Some of them are only debatably games in the sense that D D or a video game is a game.

 Comparing D D to those games, you find that D D very much seems antagonistic and competitive.

Nah. People just have inferiority complexes so have to claim everything else is awful forever to make themselves feel better about their choices. Kind of like the idiots who shout about whatever console sucking or being better. </TEXT>

Not really. Price-fixing wages, for instance, is good for consumers, but bad for people who work in the companies.

This form of cooperation would pretty clearly be illegal, as the purpose would be to force other companies to do exactly what they wanted. A group of companies getting together and agreeing not to use toxic chemicals is not the same thing at all. If all the refrigerator manufacturers voluntarily agree not to use some toxic chemical, that would generally be okay. If on the other hand they all agreed not to buy a chemical for more than X, that would be very much illegal.

It isn't pro-consumer anyway, it is pro-themselves. There's nothing wrong with reviewing something after it has been released; all of my own reviews are of released products. The problem from their point of view is that it drives fewer clicks.

Their actual goal is monopolization. If you get early review copies, you have a competitive advantage over the general public. If you don't, then you don't, and people can go elsewhere for reviews at the same time as yours. This favors incumbent players rather than new independent reviewers. This is clearly an anti-competitive business practice, as the purpose would be to force companies to send them early review copies so that they had a competitive advantage over new outfits.

 And finally, would Metacritic ignore those scores?

Why wouldn't they? They aren't representative of anything. Doubly so because it was an established policy, so they would just put stuff down in the "still being reviewed" section. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You left out Uruguay, but yeah, there's arguments for a few more countries.

Chile and Uruguay generally rank #1 and #2 in most metrics in Latin America, Chile has a reasonable homicide rate (3.6 per 100k), Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina all have per-capita GDPs above $20k per year...

Argentina and Uruguay do have kind of high homicide rates (~7.5 per 100k) but that would still put them well below countries like Russia. Argentina has major problems with corruption, though, whereas Chile and Uruguay have far fewer problems in that department.

Chile probably should be there. Uruguay and Argentina at least have arguments. It should be remembered that back around 1900, Argentina was actually one of the richest countries in the world, before a long series of shitty, shitty decisions made it into what it is today.

The UAE and Qatar have relatively high GDP and relatively low homicide rates but also are major human rights violators and employ borderline slave labor. I mean, flogging and stoning are legal in Qatar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue is whether or not a game is something which has a quick burst at first and then sales quickly fall off or if it tends to sell well for a long time. It isn't about platform penetration, it is about sales profile. How "bad" initial numbers are depends heavily on the sales profile. If you have a game where half of your total sales are in the first week, and your first week is only 1 million sales, you're in the shit if you needed to sell 4 million to break even. If on the other hand your game has a long tail, selling 1 million in the first week might be an encouraging sign.

Overwatch, for instance, is north of 30 million sales now. It broke 15 million roundabouts October 1st, so it has sold as many between October 1st and now as it sold between release and October 1st. That's a pretty crazy long tail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Can guys have multiple orgasms ? Not like the BIG finale but like little mini ones?

Not as far as I know, but different guys have different refractory periods. I can have multiple orgasms within a short period of time without going soft.

 This is going to make me sound like a dick but i'm curious. How do you put little thought into your actions? Like i've noticed women like myself like to think things through very thoroughly and guys are like "hey let's do that fuck it" and i'm so confused.

This just isn't true. Some guys overthink crap, and a lot of women are thoughtless. It is very much a person-to-person thing.

Generally speaking, "Let's try it" is a means of short-circuiting overthinking something; if it isn't that hard to try, or if thinking about it won't help but experience will, it makes sense to try it.

How much people do this varies immensely from person to person. </TEXT>

Yes, but this is more about personal interests than anything else (i.e. I tend to find tomboys have more culturally in common with me).

	<TEXT>  Why do you cheat so damn much? I realize that women cheat, too. But almost every guy I date for any significant period of time cheats. I bring a lot to the table, and I give them no sexual reason to go anywhere else. What's the deal? Am I just choosing poorly?

Yes. Though it isn't quite so specific as that.

The reality is that cheating is extremely non-randomly distributed within the population. It is a cultural thing. People from some cultural groups will cheat very little, those from others will cheat all the damn time. I don't mean this in racial terms or like, "Irish-Americans"; I'm talking about very close-in cultural groups, small groups of people who naturally associate with each other.

The people I know - my personal close-proximity circle - never cheat, and look down on people who do (this is true of both men and women). However, I know people beyond the periphery of that group (my aunts) who were cheated on. But they aren't part of my social grouping, and one of them married an alcoholic. People within that social group see all sorts of warning signs of shitty behavior that other people seem to miss, possibly because said shitty behavior is normal in other cultural groupings but would stick out like a sore thumb amongst us. Indeed, such people would be socially excluded; who wants to hang out with scumbags?

You're probably part of a social group where shitty behavior like cheating is normal, so you don't recognize the warning signs because everyone in your social group engages in that behavior.

 When I was younger, every guy I dated was pissed that I wasn't looking to get married. Then I got married, and every guy thought I was stupid for getting married (I was, he's an asshole, I'm divorced now). Now that I'm divorced, every guy I date is pissed that I'm not looking to get married. Why do you want to marry me if you think marriage is stupid? I'm so confused...

Were they saying you're stupid because you got married, or stupid because you got married *to the guy you got married to*? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a few things here.

Part of it is cultural.

Part of it is a "fix it" mentality. Is crying going to help? No, probably not. Getting angry might mean that they've decided to bull-headedly fix whatever it is, or they might just be frustrated that they can't fix it.

Part of it is the fact that emotions are actually things you can consciously control. You can control your emotions quite well if you actually practice at it. Guys end up learning that the feeling associated with crying isn't very useful so they can actually just not feel that feeling in many cases, or not feel it to a great extent. I almost never feel like I need to cry.

You can do the same thing with anger as well; if you practice at not being angry, you can actually avoid feeling much anger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Society. People don't really want to have to deal with other people's emotional baggage.

For me, it depends on how well I know you. If you're one of my best buds, unloading is fine. If not, it is socially awkward, though I'm okay with helping out as long as you don't *expect* it of me.

FYI, I feel the same way about girls being emotional as well, though the feeling isn't quite as pronounced.

The biggest problem is when someone is acting clingy. Someone just talking about shit being bad for them is one thing, but expecting someone else to fix it for you is burdensome.

Incidentally, a lot of guys have "fix-it" attitudes, so if they do listen to you talk about emotional crap, they're tempted to try and fix it. I know I am. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So by your logic, all RPGs, because they come from D D, because it came from wargaming, must be competitive.

Remember, that was *your* argument.

Indeed, in reality, the argument makes no sense to begin with; most people who play D D aren't and never were wargamers, or get into wargaming *after* D D. Wargaming is a more niche hobby.

The reality is that it has nothing whatsoever to do with that. It has to do with people, not the game itself. I've seen the same mentality in Vampire games. In fact, by far the most famous problem with DMs is not "competition", it is railroading, trying to tell the story THEY want to tell, and that is a problem with every system because it ultimately doesn't have anything to do with the system at all - no system can fix people.

 In a lot of ways, once you take out the roleplaying, D D plays a lot like Descent, the board game. The GM has rules and guidelines in what they can do to challenge or threaten the players, but Descent is definitely meant to be competitive between the GM and the players.

This is simply incorrect. I've never actually played a D D game which was at all like Descent.

While you can play D D as if it were Descent, that isn't the norm.

The fact that the core game mechanics actually work as such is a plus, though.

 Try to apply that concept to a lot of other games, and you fall short really hard.

That's because most RPGs are very badly designed. It is hard to design a proper RPG, especially a complicated one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If mechanical skill alienates people from games, why are games that are difficult mechanically still played (like Dark Souls, Monster Hunter or Eve Online) still popular?

They aren't.

Eve Online isn't popular. It is well-known, but it isn't played by very many people.

Dark Souls isn't mechanically difficult. Dark Souls is a different kind of game - like a FPS or a RTS or a 2D platformer, it is a different genre from other things. Dark Souls seems difficult because it is an entirely new genre of game and because it doesn't do a great job of explaining some of its weapon mechanics. However, after you beat a Dark Souls game, you've learned how they work, and they stop being nearly so difficult; soulsy-type games aren't actually all that hard. Indeed, the reason why Dark Souls is famously hard is precisely because it isn't.

Dark Souls' control scheme isn't particularly hard to master, it is just different from what came before.

Monster Hunter isn't terribly popular outside of Japan, but it is similar in the sense that it is divergent from other action games in terms of its control style.

 Having divergence in skill level allows for lower skill level players to grow.

Not really. As it turns out, most players only get so much better at games. This is why most games are fairly easy for people who are good at video games - because there are lots of people who are bad at them.

 When it comes to Super Smash Bros, sure you don't get button combos like in most other fighters, but you do get mechanical complexities in other areas - hell, even Sakurai said that he made the game with a more casual fighting audience in mind while making Melee one of the most complex games in the series.

All of the games are designed for casual audiences. Melee was as well. Melee got latched onto by a certain community of players because unlike the N64 game, it wasn't outright broken.

 Requiring too much system mastery does alienate most people from games, I agree - but stutter stepping is not that. 

If you can simplify something, you should. There's really no reason why stutter stepping couldn't be automated; it is pointless complexity. The risk-reward would remain, but it would require less fiddly inputs.

 Would you remove bodyblocking?

Not from a MOBA. There are games where allies body blocking you has been removed, though, in order to deal with certain issues, though I probably wouldn't from a MOBA to avoid certain possibly problematic interactions (plus visual confusion over how many characters are present). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Starcraft 2 needed to do more to make itself user friendly; there are so many decisions it made which are flawed. It is too hard to play for new players, which is why it didn't end up with a huge player base, as people have more options these days and people could turn up their noses at it.

Making it so weaker players can play the game properly is actually a good thing. You want people to always be playing the real game. If you make it so people have to spend a lot of time playing before they can play your game "for reals", your game is likely to discourage many players from playing it before they actually learn how to play the game "properly". This is bad if you want to have an actual community.

You actually want less divergence in skill levels in a game, not more. This surprises a lot of people who aren't designers, but requiring too much system mastery alienates people from games.

 In short, if you took all button combos out of a game like Street Fighter, you might alienate not just those who are good at it, but also those who aren't because you don't reapect their ability to improve.

This is simply untrue. See also: Super Smash Bros. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oil had no value until people found uses for it. Natural gas had no value until people started using it as an energy source and feedstock.

Something which previously lacked value gaining value because people found some use for it is a thing.

Consumer data has always had value, but it was previously expensive to collect. Ironically, what has driven widespread use of data is the fact that it is less expensive than it once was, which means that more people can buy it, and more of it is collected because it is cheap.

 Is it valueless? Maybe you don't believe your data has value, but I'd bet you're in the minority, because "data" encompasses everything about you in this era: it's your location history, your medical records, your mannerisms (i.e. risk tolerance), your personal correspondences, your fetishes, etc. Most people don't want others using that data to sell them products they're more likely to buy (which Facebook does: it can assess your risk tolerance and partners with advertising firms to target users who are more impulsive with certain ads), in which case you are likely not better off (especially if the targeted individuals are compulsive spenders). And that's in addition to the fact that privacy of datawhile its difficult to conventionally measureis a form of value to most individuals.

IRL, people don't care and don't percieve it as valuable.

"But I heard people ranting about it on Facebook!"

Yeah. You head people ranting about it. *On Facebook.*

As they say, actions speak louder than words.

The reality is that people like free stuff. And as far as people are concerned, Facebook, Google, ect. are free stuff, because they aren't paying anything for it.

The reality is that if we had to pay for Google, a lot fewer people would have access to it and the world would be a much worse place.

The reality is that there isn't any actual danger to targeted marketing; indeed, it lowers societal costs, not raises them, because it reduces waste. If people mainly see advertisements for products which interest them, then there is less advertisement wasted on advertising products people don't want to people who don't want them.

 Surprisingly enough, it turns out that actual labour markets and international communications issues are more complicated than the economic models designed by Econ freshmen.

And yet, you, who lack even that knowledge, are even more wrong.

I even made specific note of capital costs in my post. Did you even bother reading it?

Additionally, you're making the flawed assumption that all of those are necessary to begin with. If you're serving a large market (the US, for instance,) you can make use of pre-existing infrastructure for a lot of it. New internet companies pop up all the time; you fuel your growth with the revenue you're pulling in. This has been the model for most Internet companies; they use an exploding user base to fuel exploding growth.

Companies rise and fall all the time. Remember Yahoo? It was really big for a while. Now it is pretty moribund.

That sort of thing can happen in an environment where there isn't much cost switching, and from an end user standpoint, there isn't much for switching search engines. I can use Bing or Google. I use Google because I prefer it. But there are lots of people who switched to Bing and who don't care.

 Small startups? Yes. Startups large enough to compete with the telecom and social media giants? Absolutely not.

How big was Google when it started out? Facebook? Youtube? Microsoft?

Companies don't become enormous overnight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Im not sure if its prudent to dismiss studies like this out of hand. Do you have a background in research and oncology that allows you to attest to the validity of this study?

I have a background in biology and statistics (I'm a biomedical engineer by training). However, that's irrelevant in this case; anyone with even a basic understanding of science and statistics can see the flaws here.

It is prudent to dismiss studies like this out of hand, especially when their methodological flaws are as obvious as this one's are.

Meat consumption is *predicted*, not directly measured. They adjusted it using confounding variables, as noted here:

 Country- and sex-specific calibration models were used to obtain individual predicted values of dietary exposure for all participants.

This is already a problem because they're introducing *more* variables which already correlate with these things!

They don't note that they weighted the data by the weight of the participants, and indeed, it is improper in the first place to use a broad range of weights because weight is already known to be a risk factor in these things.

On top of that, as noted by the study, smoking was more common in people who ate more red meat, and smoking is the biggest risk factor for esophageal cancer!

The study says absolutely nothing of value whatsoever. They failed to do the most basic things which are necessary to measure the results they are looking for.

If you want to do measurements of this, what you should do - the *proper* observational experimental design - would be to take people who have the same BMI and who exercise as often, and who don't smoke, and then look at that group of people and look at whether people who consume more red meat *within that group* develop more cancer.

This is the correct experimental design because rather than trying to manipulate your data, you are instead isolating a number of variables from consideration - you can't really properly adjust for BMI, smoking, ect. because you don't know the exact magnitude of those risk factors and they are much larger than the risk factor for consuming red meat. As such, the correct way of dealing with them is to just eliminate them as variables altogether; if you're just looking at people between, say, 21 and 23 BMI, who don't smoke and who exercise regularly, you're going to get better results because you've eliminated a number of variables from consideration which are known risk factors (sedenary lifestyle, obesity, and smoking).

This doesn't require any sort of advanced knowledge of the discipline; it requires a basic understanding of experimental science. You should always eliminate variables rather than try to do post-hoc adjustments to compensate for them, because in real life, you don't know how much of an impact these variables have, there is always measurement error, and in many cases, the risk factor is so large that any small variation by chance in the underlying rates will have a large impact on your estimated risk. If your smoking rate is measured as 10%, and the risk of cancer goes up 1000% from smoking, then a measurement error of 2% in the smoking rate will result in an enormous change in estimated risk because most of the people in your sample who got cancer got it from smoking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's not the result of meaningfully higher incomes.

Ah, this old canard.

No, it is because of higher incomes.

How many people does it take to build a house?

A lot, right?

That means that each house represents X many man hours.

A bigger house requires more man hours, and consequently, is more expensive and more valuable.

The idea that this is all about debt is simply wrong. It is about higher incomes.

Indeed, outside of the housing bubble, the average cost of a home in the US has varied by about +-12% or so relative to income since 1980. Even in the housing bubble, only spiked up to about 30% above the 30 year average in terms of the income:house price ratio.

Rising incomes are actually one of the major drivers of higher real-estate prices, because land in cities is finite.

But the general reality is that debt doesn't explain anything. In fact, a lot of the debt stuff is built out of carefully crafted lies.

Ever notice how they talk about how high the *average* household credit card debt is? Ever wonder why they don't talk about the *median* debt?

The reason is that most of the debt comes from a tiny, irresponsible fraction of the population. If you look at the median debt, most people just don't have huge amounts of debt.

The same is true of student loans, FYI; the median student loan even amongst people *with* student debt (not even the general population) is only about $12k, which is hardly unreasonable. The average student debt is much higher because some people are very irresponsible and take out huge amounts of debt.

The highest point of household debt in the US in recent history was at the peak of the housing bubble, which was why there was a financial market collapse - people took out loans they couldn't pay back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a lot of people forget that D D is a game. If you look at the very first D D book - the one published in 1974 - it barely spends any time at all explaining what D D is. It is pretty much entirely devoted to the rules, and hardly explains what roleplaying is at all.

Older editions had a somewhat different mentality than newer ones, but the idea that it was all about outthinking/outwitting the GM isn't really correct. 1st Edition AD D's DMG certainly took on an air of condescending superiority (oh lordy, did it), but it still talked about making things fair for the players, avoiding spoiling things by throwing in random monsters for no good reason, ect.

As the 1st edition AD D PHB, written in 1978, notes:

 Each individual campaign has its awn distinct properties and "flavor". A good Dungeon Master will most certainly make each game a surpassing challenge for his or her players. Treasure and experience gained must be taken at great risk or by means of utmost cleverness only. If the game is not challenging, if advancement is too speedy, then it becomes staid and boring. Conversely, a game can be too deadly and become just as boring, for who enjoys endlessly developing new characters to march off into oblivion in a single night of dungeon adventuring?!

 ...

 ADVANCED DUNGEONS   DRAGONS is a world. Of course, this world is not complete. It needs organizers and adventurers to order and explore it. It needs you! A fantasy role playing game is an exercise in imagination and personal creativity. The organizer of the campaign, the Dungeon Master, must use the system to devise an individual and unique world. Into this world of weird monsters, strange peoples, multitudinous states, and fabulous treasures of precious items and powerful magic stride fearless adventurers - you and your fellow players. Inexperienced and of but small power at first, by dint of hard fighting and clever deeds, these adventurers advance in ability to become forces to be reckoned with - high priests or priestesses, lords, wizards and arch-magi, master thieves. The abilities of each adventurer are fixed, but even such characteristics as strength, intelligence, and wisdom are mutable in a fantasy world. By means of group co-operation and individuol achievement, an adventurer can become ever more powerful. Even death loses much of its sting, for often the character can be resurrected, or reincarnated. And should that fail there is always the option to begin again with a new character. Thus ADVANCED DUNGEONS   DRAGONS is, as are most role playing games, open-ended. There is no "winner", no final objective, and the campaign grows and changes as it matures. 

D D has always been designed as a system which challenges the players. But the goal is not for the DM to "win" or for the players to "win", it is, as noted above, an exercise in imagination and personal creativity. Challenge was (and is) seen as essential because, without challenge, the players can simply do the same things over and over and and always succeed. For many players, stuff gets boring if things are too easy, and D D has always been intended to challenge players with the task before them.

2nd edition AD D dropped the condensation present in Gygax's writing in the 1st Edition AD D books. The DMG does mention that it is primarily directed at DMs, but the reason is noted to be that it is intended to improve player enjoyment - hidden rules allow the player a sense of discovery, as if they know everything in the monster manual and DMG inside and out, it means that they are going to lose any sense of wonder of discovery at finding these items or encountering these foes. Part of the wonder of D D back then was intended to be joy of exploration for the players, and indeed, it talks about one reason why random encounters are interesting is because it challenges the DM to come up with stuff on the fly and allows the DM themselves to be surprised at the game.

The 2nd edition DMG outright says in the opening that the players aren't your enemies, and talks about stuff like how to fix encounters which are too hard for the players and suchlike. It talks about the importance of player choice and why it is essential for interesting encounters. And indeed, out of its list of potential encounters, the one which it highlights as the actual encounter involves no combat at all, simply a choice made by the players to explore a situation.

And indeed, if you look at the 2nd edition AD D PHB, which lest we forget, was published in *1989*, two years before games like Vampire: The Masquerade came out, it specifically notes on page 9:

 **The Goal**

 Another major difference between role-playing games and other games is the ultimate goal. Everyone assumes that a game must have a beginning and an end and that the end comes when someone wins. That doesn't apply to rol-playing because no one "wins" in a roleplaying game. The point of playing is not to win but to have fun and socialize.

 ...

 Remember, the point of an adventure is not to win but to have fun while working towards a common goal.

D D didn't spend a lot of time telling people about how roleplaying worked; it assumed that people could intuit tat part, and that the hard part was the rules. Nowadays, books often spend more time talking about how to actually play the game, though most still spend very little time actually explaining how to roleplay well.

---

I think one of the flaws in many people's thinking about D D is that they don't understand the core conceit.

The core conceit of D D is that the players are a group of adventurers who are overcoming great odds in order to succeed in some heroic quest. This is why challenge is seen as so important in D D - because if heroes aren't challenged, their victory doesn't seem so sweet.

I think once you understand that, D D makes a lot more sense. It's nature as a shared experience is that of a group of adventurers overcoming a series of challenges and emerging as victorious against great odds. The DM helps create this experience, the world around them, the odds set before them - and subtly slants them in the favor of the player. Subtly is sort of key there; at its core, to some extent D D is a power fantasy, but it is meant to be a power fantasy which makes the player feel like they've overcome an obstacle, not like success was simply handed to them.

This is why some people who don't really understand D D see it as competitive - because they see the DM putting obstacles in their path, and see it as the DM trying to stop them. But if you understand the core conceit of D D, it is not that the obstacles are there to stop the player, but for the players to overcome them.

People who don't buy into the core conceit of D D are unlikely to enjoy it very much, or to really grok what it is about.

---

 If you want proof, take a look at any of the "my players did something I didn't like so what should I do" threads - you'll see one of the top comments is always basically "kill them to show them that what they did is bad", usually in the guise of "show them the consequences".

There is something of a running joke amongst DMs about killing players, which is part of it.

But part of it is also that a lot of people are just bad at the game. DMs are players, too, in the end, and a lot of them aren't very good at it.

"Show them the consequences" is really not a bad idea - it is sort of what the DM is expected to do, really. Part of the appeal of D D is that if the players go "off-script", the DM can improvise.

The thing is, a lot of the problems that really come up - the really bad ones - involve player/DM mismatches. Some players really, really just want to kill shit. If that's their goal, and your goal as DM is creating a world full of subtle political machinations... well, you've got a mismatch in expectations (also, maybe a mismatch in systems). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People are being paid vastly more. That's why we have more and better stuff - because we're vastly richer. People buy bigger houses, more cars, more appliances, television, the Internet, cell phones, smart phones, microwaves, ect.

We have vast amounts of money relative to people in the past. We are vastly wealthier. A 1950s standard of living is no longer considered acceptable. You can't even use many common 1950s building materials anymore. You know, like lead paint and asbestos.

People back then had tiny black and white TVs. In 1959, a 24" black and white TV cost $179. That's not "adjusted for inflation". That's how much it cost in 1959. A 24" 1080p full color LCD TV today costs about that much, and is considered to be small.

Median family income in 1950 was $3,216 per year. In 1960 it was $5,620 per year. In 2015, it was $56,516 per year.

"But inflation!"

Yes, inflation is a thing. But the reality is that people in 1959 lived in much smaller, crappier houses, with smaller, crappier stuff. Indeed, even in 1973, the average house was 1,000 square feet smaller than it is today. Same goes for the median house comparison.

Where do you think all that extra stuff came from? Magical fairies?

People have more and better stuff and bigger and better houses because we have vastly more money today than we did historically. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No they don't. They don't address the issue I touched on at all in that paragraph. In fact, if you look at table 2, you can see that not only does quartile 4 have the highest average BMI, it also has the largest standard deviation. Moreover, quartile four has an enormous range in terms of amount consumed. Quartile 4, for instance, has a range of 1661196 grams of total meat consumed per day - an order of magnitude larger range than the others.

Why use quartiles when you see such a huge range of variation? Because it conceals the extreme upper end of the distribution.  It is a classic means of hiding data which is tremendously damaging to your conclusions.

It should also be noted that the people who ate the most red meat also smoked more, which is a kind of problematic demographic factor there because esophageal adenocarcinoma is strongly associated with smoking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Controls should always be as simple as possible. In a FPS, for instance, you reload by pressing a single key, and automatically reload when your ammo is out. Indeed, some games don't even have reloading, making them even simpler. Some games don't even have limited ammunition, like Overwatch.

Introducing reloading is not something which should be done without thinking; it should have a purpose. Reloading, from a mechanical perspective, means you cannot attack continuously; you must take a break from it. In some games, this is a good thing - in Overwatch, for instance, it means that you cannot lay down an endless stream of suppressive fire. If the enemy can bait you into wasting your shots, they have a window of opportunity to attack while you cannot or while your ammo is depleted so you can't lay down as much fire. Some characters - like D. Va and Reinhardt - don't have limited clip sizes, while others, like Orisa, have very large ones. Others, like Roadhog, have very small ones. This alters how these characters play, because Roadhog has to make every shot count while Orisa, D. Va, and Reinhardt can attack continuously without consequence.

But it would be retarded to make it so that there was a complex key sequence required to reload a gun. Why make it more complex than pressing R? There's no actual reason for that; it is just pointless complexity. Likewise, they make you automatically reload when your clip is empty because there's no reason not to reload at that point.

They don't limit total ammo counts because that would require people to run off and replenish their ammunition, which would screw up the flow of gameplay.

On the other hand, in a game like DOOM, you have a bunch of weapons. You can fire your guns until they're empty, and can run around and pick up ammo from the ground. DOOM is all about the run-and-gun, with you laying down fire constantly and no interruptions for reloading (though some weapons, like the Super Shotgun, have a much lower rate of fire which is represented by a reloading animation). DOOM's gameplay doesn't want you to waste time reloading, it wants constant action in fights, not you running off to hide like a pansy. So there's no reloading.

Stutter-stepping is a basic form of movement. There's no reason why it shouldn't be automated. If you want to stutter-step outside of the "perfect" rate of it, you can do so manually, but if you just want to fall back while firing continuously at maximum rate of fire, or move forward while firing continuously, it should be automated.

Simple controls mean people's characters do exactly what they want them to do, which is a good thing. The goal isn't to make people's control of their charcters difficult, it is to make them play correctly. The decision should be over whether or not stutter-stepping is appropriate in the situation at hand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Alarmism isn't what I meant to convey.

Of course it is. Heck, look at the end of your post:

 TL;DR: Shit's gettin' fucked.

The sky is falling, the sky is falling!

 Nothing is ever absolutely free to use. Tradeoffs are inevitable, and in one way or another, you have to compensate someone or some business for their opportunity cost if you use their service. With Google, you do that with your data.

You're wrong.

If something is valueless to you, but someone else is willing to give you a product or service in exchange for it, you're strictly better off.

My Amazon browsing data is valueless to me, but it is valuable to some companies. If I can get free products or services by having Amazon/Google sell companies data about my Amazon browsing data, I'm not losing anything and I'm gaining something of value.

It's like if someone is willing to pay you to take your garbage away; your garbage is something you'd otherwise have to pay to get rid of, but instead someone is willing to give you something for it. Heck, if someone was willing to take people's trash for free, instead of charging for it, a lot of people would hop on that. The fact that they're making money off of it is irrelevant; from your perspective, it is still garbage.

Economics is not zero-sum.

 What I'm attempting to do here is provide the scope of this issue and give people the facts necessary to have an informed debate.

The problem is that your premises are wrong and your conclusions are wrong. As such, it isn't providing the basis for an informed debate.

 But I do know that there are many serious downsides to big data, just as there are many upsides to it as well

The problem is that you don't recognize that your belief is not knowledge.

 The point I was making was that big data makes that uncertainty and usual lack of foresight when it comes to horizontal integration of companies much less of a factor. When you can see what businesses consumers are searching for, how they're talking about it, how they're sharing it and how they're using it, you can start to map trends.

Economy of scale has always been a thing and will always be a thing. Incumbents in a market tend to have an advantage for this very reason; they've already invested in the capital and they already benefit a lot from economy of scale.

But the reality is that if some other search engine did what Google does, but better, people would switch over to it. Indeed, the cost of switching in terms of switching search engines is very low. The cost of switching on Facebook is higher if you've got a lot of friends on Facebook, but if you don't really use Facebook, the cost of switching is negligible. And indeed, I know lots of people who barely use Facebook or who don't use it at all (I check mine maybe like three times a year). Undermining these monopolies is actually really easy now in many ways, because all they have to do to get away from you is click on another website.

In a traditional space, it is very hard for your audience to completely abandon you overnight; it takes time for people to build stores and factories and suchlike. But on the Internet, there's just one website; someone who builds a new website can eat your lunch in a day because the physical investment to be everywhere simply is not as high. The Internet is actually really friendly to low-capital startups, because you don't need physical spaces so much.

Having lots of data is no different from any other form of capital, and in the end, making predictions requires extrapolation from data. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Game design 101: never make your game's controls unnecessarily complicated. Your game's controls should be as simple as possible.

Mechanical complexity is pretty much inevitable in a game like a MOBA. Trying to avoid the pointless introduction thereof is important, as MOBAs are already really complex games with a lot going on. There's no reason not to automate it; it makes the game more accessible and allows people to spend more focus on things that really matter and are interesting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope! Stutter-stepping is pointless busywork.

Imagine, for a moment, if reloading your gun required a specific keyboard sequence for each character, instead of just pressing R.

Stupid, right?

But that's what is going on here. Stutter-stepping is a basic form of movement, but it requires a lot more APM for no actual reason beyond "we didn't bother implementing a feature which automates it". There's no reason not to do so.

It doesn't make the game any better. It actually makes it worse, because it makes it harder to use heroes which need to use stutter stepping properly for no reason at all. </TEXT>
