	<TEXT> Shortly after I posted that I found that video too! Makes me upset because I wanted to do a light and dark version set for a hero but no sun beam execution.... But there it is! And I can't have it! Bah! And now that you mention ornaments, I don't think I got those either. Feels bad, man. Hopefully this will get patched up for both our sakes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A quick search shows a thread from the Ubisoft forums asking the same thing you are now... but on release day. Now I have never seen it in the customization menu for executions ever so I assume it did not exist, coupled by how I haven't witnessed it used in game either. So two things are possible: this shit is super bugged or it never was there for executions. Ubisoft, man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There never was a sun beam execution. It's just the emote effect from season pass and idle effect from uplay rewards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How can it be intended when it worked previously, and still currently works on consoles?  This issue only affects PC. It is not intended. They just haven't fixed it for PC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope you have a source because Ubisoft support says this is not intended. Also, this only affects PC and works as intended on console. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing that fucks me up most against Zerks is that they have odd parry timing for a lot of moves so I miss it and get eaten. Also you can't parry that spinning chop after the first hit goes by lol. I always try. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's the same as Conq, it comes out faster on different stances so that's probably why you see so much switching. </TEXT>
