	<TEXT> By the way, Bonifacio was rich. He dropped out from school and worked as a bodegero. It may sounds like a lowly job but its not. It involves inventory and a lot of paper, which actually earns a lot of money. He also worked for other companies that involve desk jobs or managing jobs. His mother was also a mestiza and his father was a politician. Like Rizal, he also had special conditions growing up.

You should try reading Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil. It offers a good critique of religion and its harmful effects on society. Most of his arguments are relevant to the Philippines. The Philippines would actually make a good example of what Nietzsche was warning us about. People can afford to smile about Yolanda because religion has conditioned us to be more accepting of our misery and cling on to prayer which is basically a form of closing our eyes and pretending to not feel. The brand of catholicism brought here by the spaniards is the more potent conservative dosage that tells you to not want material things, and what matters is what you get in the afterlife. That logic influenced most of the norms we have now that numbs as from misery. In addition, religion teaches you to be afraid of committing sin that is why a lot of people are afraid of possessing power. They leave everything to the politicians and become politicaly apathetic. They do not concern themselves with societal suffering and they merely pray and ask for the strength to endure the suffering you endure. Religion tells you to be thankful of what you have and not be selfish and want for more. Settling for what you have is a problematic framework of thinking because it is through dissatisfaction you become motivated to strive towards something better. 

Another recommended read is "The Jewish Question" by Karl Marx. He talks about secularization and how the State needs to be above religious institutions.  </TEXT>
