	<TEXT> Reading this makes me think you're either insane or very young. Teachout was an embarassment. Just another out of touch lefty. Cuomo didn't debate her because there was absolutely no point in doing so - might as well debate Jimmy McMillan.

Anyways, she wasn't "supposed to be your representative". Faso was. Because he won the election.

I'm sure you think every Republican is a "spineless lobbyist" and don't know anything about Faso, so excuse me if I take your analysis with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> single payer is the cheapest option

lmao yeah because monopolizing a market makes it cheaper. It's just a blatant lie that single payer makes healthcare cheaper. Look at our progressive neighbor, Vermont, who gave up the dream of socialized medicine because they would have had to double their taxes to accomplish it. In a state where our budget was 8 days behind schedule and we have continuously been in a deficit, do you really think single-payer healthcare is feasible in any sense?

Also find it funny that you think I'm "undereducated and vocal", considering I work as a legislative assistant in the state Senate. By "undereducated and vocal" you mean "publicly supporting something you oppose".

Finally, it is absolutely insane to say it's immoral to profit from sick people. Are you opposed to doctors and drug companies making a profit from the sick? Are you opposed to the police making a profit by helping people who are in danger? The profit motive is the basis of the market, and the very thing that continuously drives innovation, increases productivity, and lowers prices. You clearly are not opposed to doctors making money, nor any other healthcare providers; you just want them to make that profit from being paid by the government, rather than having to satisfy customers. That deadens innovation and gives no incentive to improve.

public services in this state are run fairly well

What drugs are you on? Public services are in many places unable to pay their workers thanks to the new minimum wage laws. The county governments have to shoulder some of the bill for Medicaid. New York's government has a long-running track record of corruption and incompetence in both parties. Just look at Skelos and Silver.  </TEXT>

This means jack shit. Just like every time there's a post about some no-name running a hopeless election for Congress. We need to get word out, we need to work hard for libertarian principles, we need donations and support in every possible way. And we have to be realistic about our prospects.

We absolutely do *not* need to pat ourselves on the back for having 9 mayors of little bumfuck towns and 1 mayor of a decently sized city. Keep things in perspective when people say "10 mayors". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Loans need to be paid off, however. Price absolutely does matter.

Universities cannot lower their prices that much, though. Lower tuition means lower revenue. That means less money for them to spend on education... You cannot increase the quality of education while decreasing tuition. 

And yes, I think we should get rid of government-backed loans. There are many things we can do to make the education market more competitive. This is not one of them. 

IMO, Cuomo is doing this because he wants to appeal to progressives when he runs for president. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it'd be nice for people to be able to get decent jobs without being required to go to college. Many poor families can't afford the non-tuition costs of college as well.

And again, this is a sudden cut-off point rather than a gradient, which makes it both arbitrary and completely asinine for anyone who makes a penny more.

Private schools may still make money, but it is impossible to compete with something that is "free". (And have we discussed spending? Cuomo hasn't said a word about how he's going to fund this.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lincoln was undoubtedly a tyrant. He imprisoned people without trial and ruled essentially by decree. When the Maryland legislature was planning to vote in favor of neutrality (not wanting to take sides in the war) he had them all arrested and held without trial or cause. 

Another terrible thing is that, during his reign, the USA became thought of as a country rather than a federation of states. Him saying "The United States *is*" rather than "The United States *are*" was a huge thing at the time that had major ramifications for how people viewed the USA.

And of course he didn't care about blacks. While the Reconstruction governments of the South disenfranchised whites and former Confederates and helped the blacks, once the mostly-Republican western states came into being around the mid-1870s, the Republicans stopped trying to help blacks and mostly left them to the whims of their Democratic masters. Abolitionists opposed slavery because they believed it gave slave owners too much power compared to other white citizens, not because it was bad for slaves. (Many actually said it was good for slaves, and bad for slavemasters.)

Anyways yeah. Fuck Abraham Lincoln.  </TEXT>

Liberals never seem to realize that $15 in some areas is worth more than others due to cost of living, etc. I don't support raising the minimum wage at all, but at least Hillary Clinton was smart enough to have a plan that was flexible for some areas. Most aren't, and assume that what is wealthy for them is wealthy everywhere.

	<TEXT> "White" usually refers to people of European descent. Jews are Semitic, like Arabs. They're also not Christian, they are Jewish, which has caused a lot of tension (Jews killing Jesus, Christians retaliating against Jews, etc) and Jews tend to be highly tribalistic and retain their own culture, which sets them apart. Even Haaretz and Forward insist Jews are not white. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, and Mike Pence totally supports them too

Given that Trump has said he supports gay marriage and doesn't care about trans bathrooms, yeah, he is the first president to support gay marriage from day 1. He chose Pence to broaden his ideological appeal, because, you know, ideological diversity is a Republican thing.

You morons will see in time

Yeah, I've seen over and over. Every few years the climate change alarmists yell "Manhattan will be underwater in 10 years!" and then when they're wrong they change the date. It's just like the mongs who constantly talk about how the apocalypse is going to be 10 years from now.

	<TEXT> They support a strong state. Maybe not the one we have now, tho.

Saying groups like antifa aren't needed or are bad because genocide is already illegal shows a severe lack in your understanding of history.

Historically, paramilitary groups have only created violence, never helped it.

And saying antifa don't shut down groups that advocate and act on platforms of hate show that your knowledge of antifa is also lacking.

They just don't. Antifa constantly lose fights and attack people who are not hateful. Plus, antifa decides what is and is not hateful, so... They're just domestic terrorists, really. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry about the low resolution, it's hard to find good maps of Russian provinces (technically federal subjects).

Some description of the parties:

United Russia describes themselves as "conservative" but they are much different than American conservatives, as they are pro-government and generally support a strong centralized government. They could best be described as a party of power, as they really lack much ideology and are mostly centered around Vladimir Putin himself.

The Communist Party is a hardline Stalinist party which wishes to immediately nationalize all natural resources, agriculture and large industry. They are the second largest party in Russia, which isn't saying much.

The Liberal Democratic Party is described as "neither liberal nor democratic". They're actually a quasi-fascist party, being ultra-nationalist and left-wing economically. 

The final "major" party in the State Duma, which has no heads of state, is A Just Russia, a broadly centre-left party. (This is probably comparable to the Labour Party in the UK or the Democratic Party in the USA.)

There are also two minor parties in the State Duma (Russian parliament): Rodina (another Russian nationalist party) and Civic Platform (a liberal-conservative party; probably comparable to the Republican Party in the USA or Conservative Party UK.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Antifa groups tend to be made up of anarchists, communists, and other leftists.

And they are all against civil liberties. Also, many of them whole-heartedly support a left-wing state.

People that are this far left tend to be against the current state.

Yes, because they want a much more oppressive and left-wing state.

Is opposing people's "civil liberties" to incite violence against minorities wrong?

It's already illegal to incite violence. Antifa attack people in the street for disagreeing with them.

s opposing people's "civil liberties" to organize in groups that actively try to harm people based on skin color, religion, or gender identification wrong? Is it wrong to organize against mass exploitation because of someone's "civil liberties?"

Antifa don't do any of those things, though. They attack people who disagree with them, including generic Republicans. Also, antifa are groups made to harm people based on their ideology, so...

I'm not even sure what you mean by this, but that's literally just false. If you're talking about healthcare, the market would decide. As opposed to the government.

	<TEXT>  Would the opposite of a fascist not be someone who supports antifa?

Not even remotely. The opposite of a fascist would be someone who is against toxic nationalism, against racism, against statism, against violence, and in favor of civil liberties and the separation of society from the state.

Antifa use the same tactics as fascist brownshirts and, by and large, also oppose civil liberties and support the overwhelming state.
