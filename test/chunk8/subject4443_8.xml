	<TEXT> If it's GPU intensive go for AMD RyZen and pair it with a 1080ti. The Ryzen 1700 holds it own against the 7700K in 1440p and 4k gaming, which is GPU intensive to an extent.  But is behind at 1080p gaming which is CPU intensive.

The 1700 also has lower temps.  Plus 8 cores with 16 threads for its price.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're planning on getting a 1060, get an Radeon RX 580 instead.  Same performance as the 1060 in DX11 and better in DX12 but at a lower price.  

That unless the just released (like a day or two ago)  1060 9Gbps outperforms it(which it should) . 

Also. In case of the 580 get the 8gig vram version and that of the 1060, the 6gig version.  Digital Foundry did a review few days ago and the 3gig version had noticeable fps drops because of the limited vram. 

Your cpu looks great.  All good on that side.

Just saw that you've a budget of 1000. In that case you can add an ssd, which will speed things up. Provided you move OS and game files onto it. Kingston and Samsung are the best in SSDs. 

Also RAM. You haven't mentioned how much of it you have. Preferably 8/16gig.

Could have suggested a 1080ti for that budget. But since you plan on gaming at 1080p. I feel the 580/1060 are good enough.

To answer your question :Is a 1060 must? 

The 1060 (and the 580)are **the** 1080p graphic cards.  They give the most fps for the value at 1080. You could go for a 1050ti/RX 570 and they'll do just fine. But it'll be borderline performance. With more fps drops.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check out digital foundry's review on YouTube.  The 580 is way more consistent at times as compared to the 1060. It's surprising really, when looking especially at frametimes. Most of cards dipped like crazy for a bit, but the RX 580 was still way steadier. Especially in far cry. Primal which kicked every cards ass. 

On the flip side it ran at 100% as compared to the 1060s 95/98% in Pauls Hardwares review.  580 Was cooler than the 1060 at all times.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unless you have a GSync monitor ditch both of these and go for the RX 480 4/8 GB versions or wait a bit and get the refresh 580. 

Thumb rule is if you're considering anything under GTX 1070 opt for an AMD card.  The RX 480 gives same or better performance at DX11 against the 1060, while beating it in DX12. The 480 costs nearly similar to the 1060. 

This is unless you have a GSync monitor or need the card for CUDA too. </TEXT>
