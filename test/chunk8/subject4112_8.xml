	<TEXT> Worked nights in an office. Called boss and told him there was a very strange smell around the entire office, was giving me a headache. He insisted it was all in my head. I ended up relocating to the garage for the rest of my shift much to the disapproval of my boss (I told him if he wanted to come down and investigate he was welcome  but I wouldn't  be sitting in there, after he said not to call anyone )  
  
The next morning the office staff came in, same smell, headaches all around. Boss was there and still insisted people were overreacting to a bad smell. Somebody eventually called the gas company who came with the fire department and they made everybody evacuate the building because of a Carbon Monoxide leak.   
So I almost died working a night shift because my boss threatened disciplinary action if I was going to call the fire dept or gas company. He was an asshat. I don't work there anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's kind of a random point to make. It's like saying if England had  been a landlocked country they wouldn't have had the British Empire.    
If America had been as close to England as Ireland (are we talking the same size as Ireland or the entire continent being that close) then most likely England would've attempted colonization a long time ago and put America in a similar position to Ireland in their attempts at gaining independence later down the line, which we know from history, did work for Ireland.   
  
So, I guess I agree that there would have not have been a "revolution" in the sense of the American revolution, but I think people's yearning for independence would eventually bring about some sort of rebellion (or many) as it did in Ireland.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think as you said, Prez was upset with what had happened Randy and knew that having any of them talk with the police would put them in danger. That's why he tells them the location of the playground that Randy sent Lex up to. It does seem like Prez is almost hindering their case since he knows where the bodies are being stashed but I think his lack of knowledge on the case (did he know there were so many missing bodies?) and his attempt to protect the kids , but by giving Lester the location of the playground I think he knew that Lester could put the pieces together by himself.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, you are not alone. I've been working in transportation and logistics for over 10 years. You are NOT alone. Believe me.   
  
What can you do to improve it?   
What kind of landmarks are you trying to remember? A McDonalds or some other big stores are not great as they move locations regularly and new ones will open in a close by area and confuse you that way.   Try focusing on 4 bigger, permanent landmarks that you can use. (Mountains, Oceans, state/country borders) If there is a large river close by, figure out which direction it flows (east/west, north/south?) If the river is big enough you should be able to figure out where you are in relation to that.   They don't need to be close either. When I lived in NY (not close to the ocean) I used to use the Hudson river. I knew what side of it I lived on. Therefore I knew whether or not I needed to go east or west to get to it. I also knew it flowed North and South so I was always able to tell roughly where I was in relation to that river and which direction I was facing.   
  
[ If you live near a big town or city you can use the highways to figure out directions.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/40akjw/simplified_us_interstate_highways_1052x821/)   
Even numbered highways go East/West (e.g. I-90) whereas Odd numbered highways go North/South (e.g. 1-95). There is more to this numbering system that will blow your mind but it gets confusing. This is just for the US Interstate system but other countries employ similar models for numbering to make things easier.   
  
Start trying to not use your google maps when you're going to places you are relatively sure you know how to get to. Imagine yourself standing on the map, figure out which direction you are facing and imagine yourself walking the route on the map.  
My wife is not very good with directions but she started playing Pokemon GO and I have to say it has helped her read maps immensely.   
  
Play with google maps in your spare time. Look up routes that you take frequently focusing on where they are in relation to your 4 major North, South, East, West landmarks.  </TEXT>

[I think that this is the area of the Parking Garage](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.9543334,-75.1632037,3a,75y,323h,72.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sG1MpV_bCD4y3nH3pVygDpw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1). Not sure how much Philly has changed since then but the one way street doesn't match, the McDonalds does but it is not in the same location to the parking garage as the show depicts. I tried look at the directions that are shown briefly when Bodie gets in the car but its hard to read.

	<TEXT> Thanks for the feedback. These are the actual filming locations unless specified.   
As i mentioned above, many of the West Side locations were actually filmed on the East Side of Baltimore. Apparently there were too many trees in West Baltimore which made it difficult to keep it looking the same when the seasons changed.  
As someone else said, the police HQ i have on map is not the actual police hq but just the building shown as HQ. Probably just looked better.   
  
There are locations that dont exist as mentioned on the show. The location of Kima/Orlando ambush is non-existent but going by the scene/Google maps i think i found an approximate location. There are a few scenes like this.  
  
 Im sure there are more mistakes i made, still fixing it.   
  
Edit: The entire show was shot in Baltimore. The Philadelphia port scene included. This is where they shot the scene </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any idea where that spot was? It's a little out of the way for the map. Most people probably wouldn't zoom out that far to even see it but I'll gladly add it if you can find an approx. location for it.

	<TEXT> Awesome, I'll go back and fix these. It's tough doing this having never been to Baltimore in my life and relying on Google Maps. I'd imagine a lot has changed in Baltimore since the show was filmed so even doing street views can be misleading. Also I think they filmed in some areas and called them another. I read somewhere that a lot of the West Side shots were filmed on the East side due to there being too many trees which made it difficult to keep up on continuity with the weather changing. Thanks for the input </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for checking it out. I know a lot of the places referenced were filmed in alternate locations so I tried to notate that when I could. I still have a lot of information I want to add but I thought it was at a point where I could get some input from others on how to improve it.   
Since you're from Baltimore if you see any mistakes I made let me know, I'd really appreciate it. I did this from Google Maps streetview, this [WikiTravel Blog](http://wikitravel.org/en/The_Wire_Tour) and a few other online articles showing the more famous locations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's interesting that you'd choose The Wire as your focus for a Global Communications class because there is a recurring theme throughout the series that Baltimore is isolated from the rest of the State/Country/World.   
Think of when Bodie leaves Baltimore for the first time. He doesn't understand why the radio stations he's so used to listening to won't work outside of Baltimore. He ends up tuning into NPR, a nationally broadcast radio station and he is heard still listening to it later in the episode. It's almost as if he can't be exposed to anything outside of Baltimore (beyond NPR which he technically could listen to in Baltimore). "Why would any want to leave" he asks.   
  
There's a scene in Season 5? When Duquan "Dukie" asks Cutty how you get from "here to the rest of the world?" and Cutty says he wishes he knew.   

Season 2 does a good job of showing how the world does interact with Baltimore, but only the higher ups from each of the organizations gets a taste of this.  
 
I think ultimately The Wire was painting a picture of the immobilization that people living in these types of cities feel. There is no upward mobility. They can't escape. (Wallace tries to leave but "this shit here, it's me, yo") There are very few ways to escape the cycle (e.g. Namond), but for most people they will live and die in the same place under the same conditions. 

So to answer your question, maybe focus on the lack of communication globally within a major port city like Baltimore. How can a city so close to Washington D.C. be so ignored and cut off from the rest of the world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having moved from NY to TX, temp is very subjective to what you've been dealing with. One of my first weeks here in the late summer the temp went from 110 to 60. That's a 50 degree drop in temp in one day. I don't care where you come from, your body will feel that drop and it'll be the coldest 60 you'll ever feel. Last week it did a 75 to 20 drop over the course of 4-5 hours. Im used to freezing temps but that was a hell of a shock to the system.  </TEXT>
