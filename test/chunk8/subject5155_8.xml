	<TEXT> Actually, many of the earlier seasons had a fair amount of political/social satire as well. There were episodes about the Terry Schiavo case, stem cell research, global warming (several of them), etc. I could make a list, but I think that if you go through any list of earlier episodes and look into them, you'll find that most of them were directly addressing some current event of the time.

It's just easy to overlook the political/social context of the earlier episodes and call it the "surreal adventures of four boys" because it's been so long (15-20 years!) that we've forgotten the themes and controversies of those days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You get more utility out of saving money, they get more utility out of spending it. People have different [utility discount rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_utility). Just because your personal finance model works for you doesn't mean that it'll work for them. 

It is not your responsibility to tell others how to live their lives; you can tell them how you choose to live yours, but the path to pick is theirs to decide. Some exceptions apply for egregious situations, e.g. don't let your friends get scammed on bad real estate, but what you described are not egregious situations at all. </TEXT>

 his products have no Value

Any product that sells at any price *must* have value, otherwise there would not be any buyers.

 he did not invent much of anything

If you want to be technical about it, he holds a [number of patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Invented_Patents). Besides that, there's a neat little company called SpaceX that is doing all kinds of *groundbreaking* work. It's his brainchild.

 slap a cool sounding name on a battery car

Tesla Motors was named Tesla Motors before he bought it.

  that basicly was invented 35 years ago

Patently, ridiculously, absurdly false. Tesla Motors' vehicles have represented an unprecedented improvement in electric vehicles. There was nothing even remotely close in 2005; let alone 1981.

 acts like he needs a noble prize 

That's just totally unfounded. </TEXT>

 What I meant by using gsubs is translate each character into a Ruby statement, then execute the resulting program. 

This is a good idea. I think that might be an interesting project, maybe I'll take that on next. I'm currently learning Ruby, so I'm on the lookout for good exercises. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fellow typewriter aficionados:

I have a delightful 1960 Olympia manual typewriter: a family heirloom that was in pristine condition until recently. I took it on a plane with me as hand luggage, and vibrations from turbulences appear to have damaged some internal component: the carriage no longer moves. Based on my poking around, it appears that some spring has either broken or become dislodged. 

I read the repair guide listed in the sidebar, and various other repair guides online, but I don't have the time to do it myself (or the patience/proficiency with mechanical tools). I was wondering whether anyone here might know anyone in the greater SF bay area who is good at repairing typewriters. </TEXT>

That doesn't sound like it's made for professional seamstresses to me. 

In general, I am suspicious of the claim that a "smart iron" could significantly improve the productivity of an experienced seamstress, who will most likely already know water consumption, technique, etc. like the back of her hand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahahah, I hope you're joking man.

I knew a guy who shorted Tesla once. This was right around the time when that consumer reports article came out and addressed all the problems that model S owners had with their vehicles (door handles never coming out, random roof squeaks etc.) . He started spamming on stock twits about Tesla calling it a dumpster fire and just generally trolling the bulls. Well not one week later he's sleeping and at the dead of night he is woken by a scent coming through his doorway. It took him a minute to wake up but he soon realized the smell was smoke. He runs down the stairs of his home and bursts into his kitchen where he sees an 8 foot flame shooting up out of his garbage can. About half his kitchen burned down before the fire department arrived and the damage cost was over 50 thousand. The investigation showed that his back door was tampered with and someone broke the lock to enter his home, indicating foul play. The craziest part was yet to come though. About 3 days after the event he's staying at a hotel while repairs are being done on his home and he orders some room service. The food comes up to his room and he opens the tray. Inside he finds the meal he ordered, but to the right of the plate are 8 burned matches (previously lit). And you wanna know something about those matches. They were meticulously arranged in a pattern that specifically resembled 2 letters.... "E. M." All I'm saying is be careful about what you post and the positions you take man. I'd hate to see another young trader wiped out, account wise or literally, trying to bet against Elon Musk. </TEXT>
