	<TEXT> Yeah, sorry. 

Our production company has been having this happen to us for the past month and a half. One company hired us as wedding videographers and wanted us to be the middle man to pay the photog and they could only use a BoA merchant. The Photog claimed to be a wedding photog for.....and I shite you not.....partycity.com. THEN two days after "the event" they STILL asked us to do the transferring of money. Had to file reports and have them shut down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Been to two. Nothing but energy. VIP is pretty awesome. I went to one in Amarillo, TX and was close to missing it but made it to the ending and they were by themselves chillin and drinking. I met Tech, Krizz, Kutt (back in the day), Liquid Assassinz, Skatterman and Snugg Brim, and Prozac. All were real nice. Spent a minute or two glorifying in their presence. Even gave Tech my demo. He was very accepting of it saying, "We listen to everything." Good moment.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The emotion journey of Paul Dini's had me in chills to the point I read it back-to-back just to experience it again. I thought it wasn't going to be as auto-biographical as it was so it had me by total surprise when he went into the dark depths of his unfortunate incident and the effects on him afterwards. Not only is it a chilling tale of the classic "one bad day" that has molded both Batman and Joker once before, but it gives inspiration to those of us who find it hard to keep pushing forward with our dreams. Using characters from Batman as his own psycho-therapy, this revealing and riveting story of Paul Dini is truly great. I recommend it highly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Raising Rick Moranis' Kids

Its a 90s cartoon "Full House" esque family show about Rick Moranis after he quit the business to raise his 2 kids on his own. Incorporate a shrink ray and an human eating plant and that would be awesome. For some reason, i also thought Dana Carvey was the weird Uncle. This doesnt have to be in the pic or it can be someone more relevant to him like Bill Murray or Dave Thomas.
