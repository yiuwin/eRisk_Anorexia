	<TEXT> Let's be fair. Hakeem out played David in that series by a pretty wide margin. David didn't play poorly. He just wasn't as good as Hakeem was for that stretch. Hakeem averaged 35.3ppg, 12.5rpg, 5apg, 1.3 spg, and 4.2 bpg. David had 23.8ppg, 11.3rpg, 2.7apg, 1.5spg, and 2.2 bpg. Sean, Avery, and Vinny gave as much as Clyde, Horry, and Cassell gave the Rockets in that series. I think David would even admit that he was out played in that [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW4uXlRGAF0). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The simple, perhaps cheap, explanation is that this was a decision made by the redactor of Matthew. I agree. Matthew is originally a Jewish-Christian gospel. 

The fingerprints of a factional dispute are all over. For instance, Peter is given the keys to the kingdom of heaven in 16:9. Then in chapter 18:18-20 they are given to all of the disciples. I tend to believe contradictions like that are the result of a dispute concerning apostolic succession. Similarly, Matthew 27:25 seems like interpolation added to *sanitize* the gospel.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He needs to be more aggressive. This could be his last playoff series. If he is healthy enough to play, he needs to be finding a way to get to the basket. If he can get a lay-up, something easier, he can get confidence and his legs under him. Until I see that, I'd rather see those shots go else where. The question becomes who. I think the three ball has to fall for us to win a game. Let's hope is happens again at home. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LA aside, I think Timmy changes this series. We miss him. I'd take Timmy off the couch right now. Back to LA. He is being asked to do a lot defensively. It seems he has opted, or Pop rather, to concentrate more energy on Gasol and Z-Bo. Boxing those guys out, playing hard on defense, is going impact stat lines and offensive output. Still, I don't think we are getting the value we expected. It looks worse in the absence of Timmy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couple of things, bud. You're making yourself look bad. The context is there for anyone to see. You deleted the Kawhi post, so it makes it hard to put that in context. Here's the full Pop post:https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5zhs5p/spurs_future_post_pop/

Also, I think you are misinterpreting the word karma. Karma refers to one's actions coming back to decide a future fate. When you use that word, you are basically saying that some ill action committed by the Spurs will come back to make them a terrible team. Under the proper use of the word, the Spurs got a lot of good karma coming. Now, since I don't take people's words out of context, I don't think you mean that. What you are trying to say is that, you think the Spurs' luck will run out. The problem is--and with you track record it is augmented--that you have no real reason to say you think the Spurs will suck other than a hunch. Pop is one guy. He's a great coach, but to make a statement like that is completely discounting the job Holt, RC, and others have done in the organization.  </TEXT>

I feel like you have more posts about other teams on here than the Spurs, and you regularly post anti-Spur sentiments on r/NBA. I really don't know where your loyalties lie. 

Yes, I'm taking Memphis seriously. I've watched all the games we've played against them this year (I've watched all the Spurs games). Last night wasn't an anomaly. The Spurs are more than capable of laying 3 more eggs in this series. They are also capable of blowing them out the rest of the series. This team is like that. What's more, while you are busy rooting for other teams, you are forgetting that OKC eliminated us last year. You can say it had everything to do with Durant and that they are not the same team, but the big reason we lost was due to OKC athleticism. It is a problem we would still face in an OKC series. They've beat us more times than we've beat them this year. Who do you think Pop is rooting for? My guess is the Spurs. He, like me, realizes that the Spurs are going to have to beat the best teams to win a championship. </TEXT>

Are we really going to overlook Memphis after what happened last night? How about a Spurs upvote party, so we can beat Memphis first. This series is 2-1, and honestly Memphis has the momentum. How many series' have we seen where the other team makes a big adjustment, such as putting Randolph in the starting line up and spreading the floor like they did last night, and the Spurs don't have an answer for it. I won't feel comfortable until the Spurs answer back after last nights game. And I'm certainly not confident enough to start rooting for another team. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Number of FTA doesn't mean shit. 

This is the problem I'm having. How does saying the other team shot way more free throws than you proof that you weren't getting calls? It's not! It's actually embarrassing that people are behaving like he presented slam dunk evidence. As far as I know, there's not a rule that says the NBA has to make sure that each team gets the same number of free throws. If one team is fouling more, they are going to get more calls! How about the fact that Memphis is second in the entire NBA in average fouls committed per game. Now, that's a relevant stat! How about the fact that they are having a real tough time guarding Kawhi when they are not fouling him. Look at his field goal percentage. It's not surprising that they are getting more physical with him in an effort to stop him, but it's not working. Were there some questionable calls? Sure. But that is almost always the case in an NBA game. They could have got a few more calls. But to act like that would have swayed the game is disingenuous at best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the Spurs are going to win the championship, they are going to have to beat the best teams in the NBA. I don't care who wins, as long as the Spurs win. If the question was: who do the Spurs match up better against? But asking who should I be rooting for? Maybe I'd gloss over something like that if I didn't see so much questionable fandom on here. 

It's ironic to me that the guy who is probably most guilty of the things I said responded to my comment, so I made a point of it. I mean, this guy went to r/nba posting about how Kawhi isn't that good immediately after he had one bad game (and then deleted it): https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/60dp11/is_kawhi_overrated/
And he regularly posts stuff like that. I'd like to think we can be better fans than that.

Look, we are all assholes sometimes, but you're the only guy I see on here that's an asshole every time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you haven't seen Spicer before he became press secretary, there's a reason he got that job. He's basically been doing this kind of thing for many years, just not as press secretary. He was always a regular on CNN and all the tv news channels, and he would get pressured on talking points and laughably lie out of his ass and politic his way out of it. It's all the same, just different stage. A lot of the same people are asking him the same questions. He's been a shill for a long time. I don't feel bad for him.  </TEXT>

They made the conference finals four times over that period. Outside of the Bulls, there was no team in the east as consistently good as the Knicks over that period of time. The Bull eliminated them five times. It's safe to say they probably would have got some titles if it were not for the Bulls. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't listen to anything this guy says. He suffers from the Dunning-Kruger effect. He's been on reddit for 2 years and has negative comment karma--the definition of a troll. It was purely random on one day of the entire event. The second day you got a sure fire 93 Rodman. The first day you got a HOTM player. The third day was far more random. 

From what I've read, presents increased in value throughout that winter promo, and the final day was among (if not) the largest. It is fair to guess that the final day would be the largest, but it is a guess. I've accumulated three of these baskets. I'm going to hold onto them. EA is capable of pulling the rug out on you, so it is a gamble. In my mind, if you want to gamble for Sunday, it would have been wiser to buy the eggs on 4/13, as they went down due to a lot of people losing coins on wonderous baskets that day. People are incredibly reactionary, so take advantage of it. If they are worth anything on that day, the price is going to shoot up immediately, so you won't really profit. That is one of the few smart things OiGee ever said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, fair. There are multiple things at play here. For one, that is not how the baskets worked on the first two days. You were guaranteed to retain some value, so whether it was intentional or not, expectation was set. There was absolutely zero randomness on the day prior. On the first day, you were just about guaranteed a value of 1,000,000+ coins. The difference of value between the baskets on day 1 and 2 compared to day 3 is approximately 800,000 coins for a large number of people! What's more, usually when games like these are played, the player at most stands to lose 50% of their investment. Losing between 80-90% of your investment, and this not being rare from what other people said, is ridiculous. These are two valid reasons for anyone to be upset.

 In any field where expectation is set by a provider and then that provider literally pulls the rugs out from you, even in games of chance, people are going to be upset. You taught the clientele that the loss potential was not high, only to make it extremely high after expectation has been set. My personal loss was almost total. If EA had given any indication to the player that they stood to lose nearly their entire investment, lots of people would have not played. The problem is that EA did just the opposite. They gave people low/no-stakes gambling on the first two days, and high stakes gambling on the third. It's disingenuous. It's shady. It's unfair.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got an 84 and an 85. My guess is the value is 80-100K right now. You can't convince me that is fair. The eggs have never been that low, when you consider it takes two elite trophies to get the collectible for one egg. No matter how you slice it, eggs were always going to cost a minimum of 35-40,000. You need 10. 400,000 min for two elites that are sub 90 is a massive rip off, especially when you consider that the other days had a significantly higher value. EA also has to assume to value and cost for bronze players, gold players, and elite trophies all go up considerably when you demand exponentially more of them without increasing the supply. It's a rip off, period. OP has every reason to feel salty about his luck. </TEXT>

Whether you disagree with his actions or him as a person, it has nothing to do with the guy admitting to intentionally poking people in the eyes. If he did do that, I want to see it. The echo-chamber has become strong enough that, if we decide we dislike someone, we will be disingenuous about what we report as facts concerning that person. We are literally the west wing of reddit with facts. </TEXT>

Jones admitted he sticks his fingers out intentionally to hurt his opponents? I'm genuinely asking as I don't recall him -- or anyone else for that matter -- actually admit this.

but to say I am purposely poking people in the eye it's just inaccurate.

Ok...tell me what I missed.
