	<TEXT> A very similar thing happened to my sister who has GI problems. 

It sucked for her to have to convince people that she had a legitimate physical problem, but I can't blame the doctors for suspecting an eating disorder when they saw a 17 year old girl with an anorexic sister who was rapidly losing a ton of weight due to GI problems that did not seem to resolve with medication. 

It isn't uncommon for people with GI disorders to develop eating disorders because restricting their food intake feels like a way to "control" their illness, and food can be a major source of anxiety when it may or may not make you feel super sick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of different staff wear scrubs and it can vary based on your hospital and the setting that a specific person works in but in a hospital most patient transporters, scribes, techs (EKG, rad, ER, diet etc.), medical assistants, unit clerks, nursing assistants/CNAs/STNAs/caregivers, patient sitters/safety companions, pharmacy technicians, phlebotomists and respiratory therapists/techs will be wearing scrubs. 

Nursing itself is a pretty big field; practical/vocational nurses have a certificate about 18 months of training where RNs have at least an associates degree (which is a 2 year nursing program plus however long it takes you to complete all of the science prerequisites). I'm currently in school studying for a bachelors degree in nursing, when I graduate I will sit for boards and assuming I pass I will be an RN.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, most of my meals are pretty depressing. I have an eating disorder (anorexia binge/purge subtype) so I mostly eat alone and my meals are whatever will give me the most volume for the least calories. 

I think the most depressing is when I binge and purge, or even just when I purge. I remember one time when I was in high school my mom made me eat lunch before I went out and I ended up making myself throw up into an empty gallon ziplock bag in my car because I couldn't make myself keep down that tuna sandwich. 

Bingeing is sad because it starts off innocent but once I have what I see as "too much" or a bite of a "forbidden" food my brain just goes into fuck it mode and I have uncontrollable urges to shove anything that I wouldn't normally let myself eat into my facehole since the day is already ruined. Its sad because at this point I kind of enjoy it, I have a system and routines and sometimes I even plan my b/p sessions.  </TEXT>

This makes me so mad because in my opinion, the YMCA is one of the most body positive organizations out there! I may be biased because I work there as a camp counselor but their entire mission is based around helping people of all ages and abilities find ways to stay healthy and active members of their communities. They provide scholarships and financial assistance to lower income families so they they can have memberships and send their kids to camps and swimming lessons, they have fitness classes ranging from Advanced TRX to gentle yoga and water aerobics and specialized classes for people with Parkinson's disease. My branch employs a lot of young adults with intellectual disabilities to help them get work experience and become integrated into the community; they also have programs to help teach people with disabilities how to adapt exercises to their abilities. 

I regularly see people of all ages and abilities interacting and encouraging each other to live healthier lives so it pisses me off to see someone trash the Y.  </TEXT>

My grandmother is in her mid 70's and has had T2DM for at least 10 years but her blood sugar is still well controlled with oral meds despite her remarkably sedentary lifestyle because she keeps her weight down and watches her carb intake. 

She still eats what she wants, she just makes trade offs through out the day to compensate. Last night she had a whole bunch of mashed potatoes with dinner, but she skipped out on dessert and took home some cookies and a slice of pie to have as an afternoon treat the next day.

	<TEXT> Being skinny is something that I could be good at. I was a weird, awkward kid; I couldn't be pretty or charismatic like the popular girls but I could be skinny and skinny is ALL that I had to be. I grew up feeling very big and noticeable; while I was never overweight (looking back I was a super thin kid) I grew up in southern California and went to a school where most of the other kids were of Asian or Hispanic decent so I always towered over my peers. 

I'm also just scared of gaining weight which is probably the biggest reason I struggle to recover. I have theories as to how this fear came about but I noticed that all of my relapses were triggered by me unintentionally losing a chunk of weight then refusing to regain it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really need to get my shit together before this eating disorder kills me. It's weird, most of the time I feel like I don't have a problem and everyone is crazy but every once in a while I will start panicking when I realize that after 8 years of eating disorder my body will only take so much. 

I'm home for Christmas break so I won't see my treatment team until I go back to school in January so I have no idea what my weight is doing but my symptom use and disordered thought patterns are concerning to me.  I really let my eating backslide during finals and I haven't been able to get myself back on track; on a good day I get in and keep down 2 restrictive meals and then I usually end up subjectively bingeing and purging in the evening. I feel like a "bad anorexic" because of the junk I eat and then purge so its easy for me to justify restricting since it clearly isn't an actual problem /s. 

My family has a lot to deal with right now (my sister was the victim of a sexual assault and isn't coping well) so I really don't want to add on to their stress and guilt (my mom has already expressed that she feels like she failed us which is such BS because she is truly the best and most supportive parent a person could ask for).  

So much in my life is going well right now; I made the Deans list despite what a mess I was when I took my finals, my boyfriend and I are still happily in love and I got into a really competitive clinical rotation for next semester but I can't seem to make myself eat like a normal person.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. As a 19 year old college sophomore, the idea of dating a 16 year old icks me out; not because of the actual chronological age gap but because we would be in such different stages of life. I think that it would be hard to have an equal relationship when I'm an adult who lives on my own dating someone who is in high school and may not even have a drivers license. 

It also seems weird from a social standpoint; I wouldn't want to hang out with a group of high schoolers and I would feel weird bringing a 16 year old to hang out with my friends (and I don't know if their parents would be into the idea of their minor child hanging out with a bunch of 19-23 year olds in a crappy apartment somewhere).

	<TEXT> Exactly. 

I'm recovering from anorexia and while I generally look ok I'm still 10-15 pounds underweight and depending on the day may need to sit because I have low blood pressure and my blood sugar is unstable and will get really low if I'm not careful. I feel bad taking up a seat but I'd rather sit and have people think I'm lazy that run the risk of fainting which would ultimately be much more inconvenient for my fellow passengers. 

Heck, even generally healthy people have shitty days; for all I know the fit looking dude sitting down has a killer ear infection and can't balance for shit or just got off a 36 hour on call shift where his pager never stopped beeping.

	<TEXT> Anorexic student nurse here! 

Honestly, you can't do any job well with an active eating disorder once you have reached a certain point; no matter what you want to do you need to get yourself into treatment and commit to recovery before you end up with permanent medical problems that could make it more difficult for you to have the career that you want. 

I had a pretty bad relapse and I'm struggling right now and while I'm still doing well in school I know that this would be a heck of a lot easier if I wasn't in the throes of an eating disorder.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The state of NP education is making me really nervous. I'm not even halfway through my undergrad but as it stands I can't see myself wanting to become an NP because even if I graduate from a rigorous program and have years of experience under my belt, I will have the same title and degree as people who skated through an online diploma mill program and I worry that I won't be taken seriously. 

I also don't like that more and more programs are becoming doctorates, If I wanted to be called doctor in a clinical setting I would have gone to medical school and if you truly need doctorate level preparation to be a competent provider the argument for NP degrees kind of collapses.

	<TEXT> I had a really bad week dealing with my eating disorder; I was honest with my therapist about how I was doing on Wednesday and she tried to send me to the ER but luckily my doctor was in the clinic was able to check me out and let me go home since we I had an appointment with her the next day. 

On Thursday I got a very specific meal plan that I need to follow until my appointments next week and while I know that it is completely reasonable I'm struggling. I did ok eating yesterday, but I ended up purging at night and today I let myself sleep through breakfast, skipped lunch and really struggled through my afternoon snack and dinner. 

ITS SO FRUSTRATING because I can't be hospitalized right now and I know my treatment team is amazing for letting me do this on my own but I don't know how I'm going to make myself do this every day because I'm still pretty in denial about how bad things are because I think that I look fine and my labs were normal on Thursday (which doesn't mean much). NORMAL HEALTHY COLLEGE AGED PEOPLE DON'T GET DIZZY IF THEY WALK TO FAST STAND UP SUDDENLY OR HAVE KETONES IN THEIR URINE. love science; I believe in science but for some reason it doesn't seem to apply to me and it makes me angry that I am such a hypocrite. 

I know this probably isn't the sub for this but I needed to rant and y'all are smart, logical people who can maybe be rational with me.  </TEXT>
