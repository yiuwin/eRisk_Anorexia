	<TEXT> No. I wouldn't fit seamlessly into the college frat boy collection. Probably because I'm Asian and 5'4 and have a variety of tastes and interests besides stereotypically hetero-normative hobbies. My husband would though, even though he hates sport and doesn't mind watching fashion shows, because he appreciates it from an engineering perspective and likes going to art galleries. 

What you are talking about are very surface level things, some guys just look more hetero-normative than others, but that doesn't mean that those who appear to be bros don't also have the same tastes as your stereotypically femme queen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could pay someone for muscle worship? I don't know anyone who would do it without payment unless they like loved you or something. If you are hoping to date one, the reality is that they don't see you as in their league. They work hard and spent crazy money to get that way, their expectations of their partners are also going to be high. If they were going to be happy with average, they wouldn't go through all that work </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No I'm not asking that. I can understand why they would. I'm just saying it would be a better question which promotes more interesting discourse in regards to sexuality and gender politics. Especially when we consider there is a sect of feminism which regards drag as transphobic and sexist. While I don't agree with it, it is a question that involves more discourse than why lesbian women like drag when we consider drag as being a staple to the LGBT community </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can understand deleting Uber for the anti-unionization (in-fact, that's why I did), but that's about it for me really. The whole being on Trump's advisory board thing is silly, it's not at all telling of their position on a lot of Trump's policies, especially when you consider Tesla (Tesla!) are also advisories. If anything, you need people who disagree with Trump on his advisory board so we don't have an echo chamber government. Heck, WWF and Greenpeace should do the same thing, I find it really sad that there isn't more diversity on advisory boards. At this point, it's not clear where they stand.

I also think it's a tad rich that Lyft is safe because they donated $1m to ACLU but did the same shady shit as Uber at JFK and that was what got everyone pissed off with Uber. Uber is at least allocating $3m to provide legal services to their employees. Now I'm not defending Uber - I believe that complete deregulation is a laugh and everyone should be given worker's compensation and sick leave. But this fiasco with Uber just feels strange. Why is no one calling for a boycott of Tesla? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of Uber drivers are pay-check to pay-check people and I am sure they would like to protest, but also need to put food on the table. I don't think it is taking advantage of the situation - people need to get home, that includes the sick, injured and elderly. You won't be making a statement by denying them a service - honestly if Uber did not still service the area, the headlines would be about the mayhem at JFK since no one can go home and how dare the taxi industry protest. 

I'm a nurse. We have protests too, but we can't all go on protests and not every hospital should or can go to a protest. There are people who rely on you at the end of the day. I mean I agree that Uber should join the protest, heck I think everyone should, but this idea that everyone should halt everything and ignore their wider responsibilities is a bit of a stretch </TEXT>

I completely understand the protesting over the ugly orange dick, but are people deleting the app over people doing their jobs? I mean Uber is not obligated to join the protest, but they still are a taxi company </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hot. I am melting and my A/C is broken and I am working 7 days this week. 

Homophobia? Sure, maybe in the much older demographic. Racism? Sure, predominantly if you're middle eastern or sikh because ignorant people think a turban means you're a member of ISIS. This however, really depends on where you live and who you associate with. In Sydney, it's more the wealthier north shore and eastern suburbs area which have less diversity to begin with which are mostly racist, but inner and western Sydney is such a mix of a variety of cultures and ethnicities it's more on the level of racial microaggressions. It's incredibly diverse and openly so - a lot of Australians take pride in the nation's multiculturalism, despite what the attitudes on the media perpetuate. 

Cost of living. Um. Yeah no, lol. Most apartments will cost you $500 p/week without bills, which is around half of the average person's weekly income. Wages and welfare are out of proportion with the cost of living and work, at least in Sydney, is a fight to the death to find. A lot of that has to do with industry closing and moving off-shore and government dislike of innovation, and because an entry-level position requires that you work in the industry for 2 years previously, but they all say that... </TEXT>

Dude, not all white men are assholes like you. For one, I've never actually met an Asian or black guy who only exclusively fuck white people. They may cruise for white people because they rarely if ever had sex with one, or like you, maybe they just find white people attractive.

	<TEXT> Honestly couldn't care less about whether a guy wants to wear makeup. There is a world of difference between doing some minor editing like bronzing, lip-balm and even a tinted moisturiser and concealer to say, drag makeup and epic contouring. 

I use a tinted moisturiser daily as my sunscreen during summer. My skin always goes pink when it's a hot day so it keeps that at bay and I use concealer under my eyes after I've worked night-shifts consistently and need to not look dead during the day. I also use a lipbalm - non-tinted because if it moisturises me, I don't need the colour. 

As long as it's not cakey or obvious, I don't think any guys would care. Make up is a personal choice and we all have perfectly valid reasons to use or not use it.  </TEXT>

I really hate this. It's like saying white people want to be black and hate themselves because they enjoy tanning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People became divided at the same point when Trump's potential presidency and the police brutality became more prominent. 

Also America thriving by being in its own bubble is not going to happen, that bubble is going to burst and crumble as quickly as it started. The future is to have a world government due to our globalisation and connectedness. Becoming isolationist is just trying to prevent the inevitable which will be a European model if open borders which have proven to be great economy boosters and good for employment. Japan is very isolationist and it is now facing an economic downturn. Same will happen to the US in this globalised world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My step sister is the same with pregnancy tests and she has that implant in her arm which prevents her from getting pregnant. It's more effective than getting Fallopian tubes tied, but she would do a pregnancy test every month. Some people just need that level of reassurance, and that is fine. But after about the 6th month she stopped doing because she got the reassurance she needed. Same can be said for you, the more you test, the more you are to feel safe and eventually the anxiety you feel will fade. It is however recommended to test at least once or twice a year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you thought that maybe it's not the Asians per se, but Grindr in general? A lot of people here talk about Asians only wanting to be with white people, but I've never met one who didn't jump anything with a pulse. Desire and action are two different things. It's possible, that since they are a minority that what you are experiencing is more exaggerated since there are so few of them. Not to mention since you want someone so badly you feel rejection moreso with Asians than others. You are way more likely to find a white hookup than an Asian one since there are way more of them, it's simple stats. 

I for one am Asian. Would fuck a darker skinned guy over a white guy any day, but really, I'd care more about how nice they come off on the app. Here's the deal with Grindr and all other hookup apps. You are literally shopping for men and because there is so much selection, bitches can afford to be greedy and seek out their dream man whereas in real life, that might be different. You'd have better luck meeting people IRL than on the app.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure do! This is my grandma's recipe:

* 2 cups of plain flour
* 5 bananas (4 if brown or over-ripened) 
* 1 cup of brown sugar (3/4 cups if using over-ripened bananas)
* 1/2 cup of butter (softened - leave sitting in room temperature for 10 mins, or just put it in the microwave for a few seconds until soft)
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon of baking soda
* splash of vanilla essence (I normally add 1 teaspoon)
* pinch of salt

Combine the butter with the sugar then add the eggs. Beat well. Add bananas - really mash them in. You can use a potato masher if you wish. Add flour in gradually (1/3 at a time) - sifted so you don't get lumps, then add salt, baking soda and vanilla. Combine well and pour it into a well-oiled baking tin at 355 F (180 C) for about 50 minutes - 1hr. Take out. Let it cool. And enjoy :) 

Completely optional, but you can glaze it with jam (I recommend apricot jam). Just warm the jam in the microwave and paint it on the cooled banana bread. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well your theory falls apart with me. I grew up without my mum in my life all too much., I've also never been rejected by a girl, because I never asked one out. I have however rejected girls. I wasn't bullied for being gay, nor was I name called. And no, I wasn't some lonely guy only being accepted by men. I had male and female friends growing up. I only dated boys and only fell in live with boys because that's how I am. No reason behind it. 

I mean are straight men straight because they get rejected by men, are lonely and only accepted by women or have too much love from their fathers? LOL. Leave science to the real scientists  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Belletrix, from my understanding, is literally telling that guy that he can hate the gay community as much as he likes, but they will be there marching in the streets to defend his rights. He makes a point about the distinction between subculture and community.  
The funny thing is, stereotyping even when you're part of the community (whether you like it or not) is still pretty lame. It sounds like you need to lighten up and get some other perspectives.

You can't argue with that. The guy has a one-sided notion of what gay people are like. 

Who says you can't be normal and part of the community? You sound like you have a lot of hate for something that requires so little of you.

Where is the lie? The OP is conflating subculture with community. Belletrix is, though not successfully, trying to point that out. Don't you find it a little interesting that OP keeps saying everyone who isn't gay is normal? </TEXT>
