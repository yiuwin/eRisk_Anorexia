	<TITLE> Ways to Save Money Each Month? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Wanted to ask everyones opinion on ways to save extra cash each month. My wife and I are officially debt free (minus mortgage) and I want to knock that one out next. 
The ones I heard recently were:
1. washing clothes/dishes after 8pm I believe due to electricity being cheaper. 
2. Order groceries online and pickup at store to not impulse buy. Aka promote meal planning.
3. Set thermostat lower in winter and higher in summer
4. Drop cable and use netflix or be a pirate ;)
Others I found were watching a Youtube video by this person: https://youtu.be/lhhMKPoJ7p0
She had some good tips but I bet we can all come up with the not run of the mill ideas that will help. </TEXT>
