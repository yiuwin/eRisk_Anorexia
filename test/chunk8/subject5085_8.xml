	<TEXT> Past OOTL threads about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/search?q=blue%2Bwhale sort=new restrict_sr=on t=all

[According to Snopes, it's totally unproven.](http://www.snopes.com/blue-whale-game-suicides-russia/)

 In February 2017, English-language web sites caught wind of a purported suicide game that had reportedly resulted in more than a hundred deaths in Russia. The general premise of the game, which goes by several names but is commonly referred to as the blue whale game, is as follows:

  The player signs up to play the game and agrees to follow instructions over the course of 50 days. 

  An administrator assigns a series of tasks (anything from cutting yourself to listening to song) that the player must accomplish. 

  The player wins when they complete the final task, committing suicide, on the 50th day.

 The claim that the blue whale suicide game (named after the way whales sometimes beach themselves and then die) had resulted in a wave of suicides appears to have originated with a misinterpretation of a May 2016 story from the Russian site Novaya Gazeta. That article reported dozens of suicides of children in Russia during a six-month span, asserting that some of the people who had taken their lives were part of the same online game community on VK.com, a social media network based out of St. Petersburg, Russia:

  We counted 130 suicides of children that occurred in Russia from November 2015 to April 2016 (!)  Almost all of them were members of the same group on the Internet.

 Novaya Gazeta  reported that at least eighty of the suicides were linked to these blue whale games, but an investigation by Radio Free Europe found that no suicides had been definitively linked to these online communities:

  But while the Russian-language Internet is groaning with profiles of young people playing or seeking to play the game, shocking photographs of self-injury like cutting marked with the games hashtags, and purported links to teen suicides, not a single death in Russia or Central Asia has been definitively tied to Blue Whale.

  Over the last six months or so, dozens of suicides and attempted suicides in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan have been provisionally linked to the game, although on closer inspection none of them has been found to have a conclusive tie.

 Furthermore, the Novaya Gazeta report was highly criticized at the time of its publication. For instance, the web site Meduza noted that Noyaya Gazeta arrived at their conclusion that a social media game was causing teenagers to commit suicide because several teenagers from the same social media group had taken their own lives. However, Meduza argued, it is more reasonable to assume that depressed or suicidal teenagers are simply drawn to the same social media groups, not that the groups were causing them to commit suicide:

  The author of the material in the Novaya Gazeta states that the community in the social network VKontakte bring children to suicide. As a confirmation of this it lists the following fact: a few dozen teenagers who committed suicide were in groups devoted to this topic. However, to reliably establish a causal link in this case is impossible, and it is quite possible to assume an inverse relationship  a teen becomes part of a group due to the fact that it is contains people who struggle with suicidal thoughts.

  The reasons teenagers commit suicide are well researched. According to data from the General Prosecutors Office, in Russia 62% of suicides among adolescents are associated with family conflicts and general distress, conflicts with teachers, classmates, friends, and also with the fear of violence by adults and callousness of others. From a report on the topic from the UN Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the increase in the number of suicides occurs in times of economic crisis and sharp social change. For example, in Russia there was an increase the number of suicides from 1987 to 1994, when the USSR collapsed. As soon as the company adapted to its new socio-economic conditions, the number of suicides stabilized.

 [...]

  Social media communities such as Sea of Whales and shock video sites shared photographs of Rina and spread a rumor that she was part of a suicide sect:

 [...]

 There is certainly reason to be concerned about groups that venerate and promote suicide, but the creator of the Sea of Whales community said that he had no interest in encouraging people to take their own lives. Rather, the groups creator says that they created the game and the surrounding lore to drive traffic to the page:

  It took just one day, however, for the news website Lenta.ru to get in touch with More Kitov, the creator of the Sea of Whales community (whales commit suicide by beaching themselves)  yet astonishingly, he claimed that the administrators of such groups had no interest in grooming minors to take their own lives but were merely interested in boosting their commercial profile. 

  He said that Filip Lis, the administrator of the now-deleted community f57, just wanted to increase the number of subscribers to attract advertisers to his page  in Russia, the social network VKontakte is also a popular advertising market, and you can earn a lot of money from popular communities.

  Having come across this topic, which was trendy with teenagers, Lis launched the myth of the sect and used Rina Palenkova (a young girl who reportedly committed suicide) to promote it. He sold her cloned pages, reposts, videos and photos of her grave as well as screenshots of her correspondence. After VKontakte removed f57, he created similar groups.

  I looked at all the fuss, got stunned by the hype and created my whales, More Kitov told Lenta.ru. He insisted that his aim was to dissuade teenagers prone to suicidal thoughts, but first it was necessary to become one of them.

 Russia has a high baseline suicide rate among young people. In 2013, for instance, 461 minors took their own lives.

 In May 2017, stories appeared in English-language media about the alleged creator of the game, who according to media reports remains detained in Russia. Phillip Budeikin, 21, had apparently confessed to inciting young girls to commit suicide months before (calling them biological waste, according to some reports) but we were only able to trace these claims back to a November 2016 story on one site, saint-petersburg.ru (translated):

 [...]

 This story was inexplicably picked up months later by international tabloids (alongside claims that the game was spreading across the world), but we remain unable to verify any of the claims. </TEXT>

That link works fine for me. What's the problem you're seeing with it?

It's probably an issue with the app; putting a backslash before the parenthesis in the URL should work properly, but if it's not working in the app, that is a problem with the app. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair point, though you're mostly off on the details: https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/

 Today were launching a test to rewrite links (in both comments and posts) to automatically include an affiliate URL crediting Reddit with the referral to approximately five thousand merchants (Amazon wont be included). This will only happen in cases where an existing affiliate link is not already in place. Only a small percentage of users will experience this during the test phase, and all affected redditors will be able to opt out via a setting in user preferences labelled replace all affiliate links.

So: not Amazon, and only in cases where there wasn't an existing affiliate link, and it was only limited to a small percentage of users (they never rolled it out sitewide, if I'm remembering correctly). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Neither of your reposts appears to have fixed [the issue I pointed out on your original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/6aigjg/marketing_charitable_donations_anyone/dhfkh7o/):

 The demographic in your post title is inaccurate (the survey seems to be limited to those who donate to charity), so your submission has been removed. Please read the title and gender guidelines listed in the [sidebar](/r/SampleSize/about/sidebar).

 The earlier questions allow for responses from people who don't donate to charity, but the later questions from "When you donate do you generally... ?" onwards are all required and almost all assume the respondent does donate to charity. You should either make them not required, or note in your title that the survey's restricted to people who donate to chairty. Feel free to resubmit with the proper title, though you should note that it's a repost to avoid duplicate responses.

Either change the demographic in the title of future posts, edit the survey to add an "I don't donate" option for those questions, or make them optional. </TEXT>

    author:
        name: [MotoGP-Bot]
    comment: "**MotoGP FP1**"

You'd need a new rule for each different comment you wanted it to make. You can customize/edit it to apply to threads with different titles, too, but your post here wasn't that specific about what posts you wanted AutoMod to do this for.

(Note that AutoMod will make these posts/comments at the time the submission is made.) </TEXT>

Moderators are allowed to run their subreddits however they want, as long as they don't violate the [content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) (or the [mod guidelines for healthy communities](https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/), which is a recent change and it's not entirely clear how strictly they'll be enforced).

	<TEXT> Not exactly, but you can use CSS to replace the submit button in the sidebar with a new button that points to a different link. We do something like that in /r/AceAttorney to redirect shitposts (though we don't replace the existing buttons). /r/IAmA does replace their buttons; their "submit an AMA" button points to a goo.gl URL-shortened link that redirects to this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/submit?sidebar selftext=true title=IamA%20(Blank)%20AMA! text=**My+short+bio:**+Enter+stuff+here%0D%0A%0D**My+Proof:**+Enter+link+here

(You can use a tool like [this](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/) to convert the desired title/body to URL format.)

I'm not an expert on CSS, but you can search/ask in /r/csshelp for more details. </TEXT>

 #Why are some comments formatted like crosswords/horizontally and vertically?

  This originated from /sp/, the sports board. It may have grown in popularity with L O N D O N, which came from /fit/ as a rumor about a tripfag named Tinytrip. The story goes that a girl went on /fit/ and Tinytrip replied "pls be in london", so L O N D O N became the /fit/ greeting towards women.

	<TEXT> My summary of the important bits about the update, from what I've posted elsewhere:

* reddit will still allow CSS customization on top of the new interface, but will be less hesitant about breaking subreddit styles

* "Logos, images, colors, spoilers, menus, flairs (all kinds), and lots more will be supported"

* "Widgets" mentioned in previous post aren't directly related (they're more related to stuff like calendars/scoreboards in sidebars, e.g. in sports subreddits); they're still considering how to go about accepting user-created widgets, and widgets will be updateable using the API

* the change/redesign will happen slowly/gradually

* they'll start with a small alpha testing group and gradually expand to an opt-in beta; reply to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6auyq9/reddit_is_procss/dhhmebb/) for a change to be part of the alpha </TEXT>
