	<TEXT> Marine of ten years.  More turds than not squeak through.  Everyone is pretending every man in the military is some sort of paragon when it is really a small percentage.  Everyone in the this thread should ashamed of themselves for being armchair philosophers. Especially the 200 pound fat body.  No one told you to become 200 pounds you fat fuck.  With training anyone can perform adequately.  Will there be less women?  Of course.  Probably the same percentage of men and women will perform adequately.

Edit: One more thing I ranged between 150 and 170 while I was in and I wouldn't want to drag a 200 pound fat body either.  Everyone is supposed to stay in shape.  And I know he could be tall but I doubt it especially if we are talking army.  Probably just butter and candy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tony stark is like the least sympathetic character in the marvel universe.  I love iron man but have not given a shit about tony stark for just about 20 years.  Now I'm not sure why they are giving it to the blackspoitation hero.  I think it'd be great if they revamp her a bit, but if they continue to write her the way they have been I probably won't pick it up.

One last thing to the ragers.  You guys like Robert Downey junior,  not tony stark.  There's a huge fucking  difference.

Edit:  mistook riri for misty knight.  Honest mistake going by just the picture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bias aside from any of our personal opinions but Forbes magazine and website has not been continuously linked with credibility.   And while formerly being critical of Donald trump,  now all of a sudden there has been a rapid fire of fluff pieces.    Now I have a biased guess and you can come to your own conclusion but Forbes is likely still reeling from the pieces about their site which was mostly citizen journalists which was also likely a bid to keep them afloat.  If they needed to keep afloat,  a good idea would be to latch on to writing about trump which is what everyone else is doing.   Only they have chosen in favor to save their failing business model.

Now does this answer the question of his net worth?  No and I don't give a shit what he has in any context.  But yes he does strike me as the type that would do whatever possible to appear more wealthy given his general attitude on personal image. </TEXT>

Also questing is extremely tedious and you should do whatever you can to not burn out from the same 10 or so quest themes.  They also prevent repetitive questions.

	<TEXT> It's probably one of the easier ones to get into and you might like it having not read others.  The main story is good but it is filled with so much awful filler or side stories that will confuse people who read other comics.  The entire story takes no chances and it ends up being very hollow.  Marvel.com has the entire series is you wanna pay 10 bucks a month and the the game marvel ultimate alliance is all about the civil war and probably one of the best comic games there is.  

Some better ones to get into first are avengers vs xmen or axis.  Both have all the big names, great story, and do not require much background.  Your local library might have a graphic novel section that contains it.

I liked civil war but it is not very popular.

Edit:  the game is marvel ultimate alliance 2 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Or you know, no doom.  What you described for doom could easily be its own movie.  I mentioned before in a post that ff do not need their own movie to be introduced.  I think just keep with the two that happened because frankly they were fine for their time.  Bring reed from the campy version and recast everyone else and stick them in civil war.    15 minutes of screen time tops could totally justify why they are there and just have a couple of montages of reed building a prison to hold caps team if and when they are caught.  Show sue getting pissed about and leaving.  Have an epic fight scene with Johnny that ends in him getting badly injured and just show thing going to Europe.  Then continue to include them in future movies and maybe when the dust has settled, give them their own movie.  I think a great future collaboration would be with them and the inhumans or black panther because neither one appeals to a broad audience.  So you take two things that have a small dedicated fan base and hope for the best.


I like doom but he is not necessary to the movie universe presently and requires far too much development.  The sad truth is ff is not popular enough and most of the fans are too old to go see a reboot that is trying to appeal to a younger generation.

	<TEXT> Marine, 10 years, you and your friends are saying it wrong.  There is no hup.  It's hump, hike or march.  You're right that it's silly to argue about, but now you know what it's called.  The only thing I can think you got it from is the Air Force and army often say hup instead of one while marching.  As in, hup two three four.
Edit:  it's called humping because your gear makes a hump on your back when you're crouched over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, it's pretty common any time.  The sheer amount of running keeps it that way.  Gym rats make up a very small part of any group/battalion and even they often have skinny legs.  The only other exceptions are fat turds in admin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Algebra 2 is not a challenging class and it is not intended to be.  I'd hold off on naming him a wunderkind just yet.  Without proper studying techniques, as soon as he runs into a challenging class it could affect him greater than if he had been prepared.  This is why you have able students dropping out after they get past their 2nd year of college and are not prepared for classes that you MUST study and research for.  Rote formulae memorization only has an application in solving problems in high school and will serve you no purpose in life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did all my pre- engineering stuff at a community college.  There was a scholarship program were engineering students could take two free courses a semester at the ridiculously expensive university nearby.  Another great thing about community colleges is there is often guaranteed transfers to all universities in the same network.  One more thing I would add is the exact same professors taught at the the more expensive universities, and there is literally no difference in courses.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like they should have just thrust them into a movie that wasn't their own.  Would have been great in civil war.  Just show reed working on the negative zone prison and sue getting mad and joining cap.  Each character in ff had little time in the limelight and you'd only have dedicate like 10 minutes of the movie to them.  I'd keep the first movie reed and just give him a better script.  The rest would need to be the new guys. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, we wrote Benghazi off.  I worked in the dept of state when I was an embassy guard.  The lack of care with classified documents was rampant and people would regularly have their clearance stripped or face other consequences.  In these cases there were 1 to 3 incidents.   If anyone else had  done what she had done,  the repercussions would have been tremendous.  

Just because the right has made a farce of this, doesn't make it a legitimate concern. </TEXT>
