	<TEXT> I had been prescribed ADD meds on and off in the past. Honestly the appetite suppressant effects only last like 2 weeks for me. You're right, it makes it *easier* to restrict, but hunger does come back. It's up to you if you want to eat or not. Like, once because of Adderall I didn't eat for 3 days and by day 4 I was absolutely ravenous, but I chose not to eat despite being hungry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow you don't have to be rude. A *side effect* of Adderall is decreased appetite. You're not going to feel that side effect forever unless your doctor continues upping your dosage for the rest of your life. Eventually you're going to get your appetite back even while being on Adderall. That's why people are saying "stop eating so much". You can't rely on Adderall forever to help you maintain your weight or lose weight. </TEXT>

And I do hunter/jumper mostly. I dabble in dressage here and there but I primarily jump. That's so cool you used to break horses! I don't know how you did it. I myself am too scared to get on a green broke horse even - you have some serious balls. I actually started out riding western but switched to English because I found the westenr saddle to be too heavy to put on the horse I had been riding haha. My boy is 18!

	<TEXT> TMI but I STILL have not had a BM since I think Friday? Saturday? I coffee fasted on Sunday to see if that would force a BM and no amount of coffee and cigarettes helped with a BM! Yesterday the scale was down 0.2 pounds which I was so happy to see, but today it's up 0.6 pounds which I know is food and water weight (especially since I haven't had a damn BM). 

I'm lactose intolerant and I had half a cup of Halo Top last night and that didn't help at all. I'm seriously thinking of living off cream cheese and the rest of my Halo Top today since I *am* lactose intolerant - that might work in my favor. 

I am so fed up! I could scream! Or cry. Or die. Okay not die but ugh. 

Any ideas as to what I can do about this? It's so frustrating and truthfully my stomach/belly area is in quite a bit of pain and discomfort. I'm thinking of either coffee fasting again today, living off ice cream and cream cheese today or biting the bullet and buying some laxatives.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So after mostly hating last week's keto trial, I'm back to eating carbs. So far I've had a veggie burger and that alone has made me feel much better. I will also be upping my dosage of Prozac so hopefully my mood improves even further (I'm already feeling happier!).  I went food shopping yesterday and bought some good safe foods. I have my macros set on MFP to 40p/30c/30f. I've pre-logged all my food for the week and my macros are pretty spot on! I'm trying to not stress too much about the carb and fat macro, and mainly work to meet my protein goal. I have a horse show this weekend and I bought stuff to make breakfast sandwiches to eat prior to showing with balanced amount of carbs, fat and protein. Each sandwich came out to like, 320 calories which isn't bad at all. I probably won't eat anything on horse show days besides that breakfast sandwich. Maybe a Fiber One bar if I'm feeling too drained. I'm really excited for my show and I'm so relieved to be off keto. Hopefully my weight loss will be linear this week, especially considering how physically active I will be. 

I hope you all have a lovely week! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys! I just started taking the survey and heads up - it can be extremely triggering (in regards to eating disorders, depression, substance abuse, suicidality, dysfunctional/abusive families and sexual assault) and a total damper to your mood. If your mood is low right now or you are feeling emotionally unstable/vulnerable in any way, I would strongly encourage you NOT to take this survey.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah this is me. Counting macros is really stressful for me but I've been an athlete for the last 2 years and I've put on a lot of nice muscle that I don't want to lose. I did keto last week, and while I hated it for the most part, I can visibly see that it helped me lose fat instead of muscle. I have so much more muscle definition in my thighs (though they're still mostly covered with fat). I'm just trying to focus on my protein macro and trying not to stress about the other macros. As long as my intake is mainly protein, I'm okay. </TEXT>

I totally feel you regarding being too tired for the gym. I usually eat 300-600 calories a day. If I eat closer to 300 and am sedentary, I still hardly have any energy to work out. But the days I eat closer to 600 are days I ride, and after riding I have 0 energy to do anything. </TEXT>

I force myself to the gym sometimes but when I can't make it, I don't feel *as* bad about it because I know I tend to burn roughly the same amount of calories in the saddle. 

Question: I know you said on my one post that you eat chicken breast like every day. What do you do to season it? Usually I brine it for 15 min before I bake it, then rub in a mixture of salt, pepper, garlic powder, etc in before. But I'm looking to do a bit more with it without adding too many oil/fat calories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I've realized in the last few weeks just *how bad* my eating disorder has gotten. Like, in the past, if someone invited me out to eat, I would go out, eat what I wanted and just go back to restricting the next day and continue until something else came up. I was happier back then, more social *and* I still lost weight. Isolating myself due to food has made me so depressed that my psychiatrist even put me back on Prozac. 

However, today I did something really good! My old barn was having a Mother's Day lunch and I actually went! Originally I wasn't going to go, because food, but I bit the bullet and went because I knew that if I didn't go, I'd spend yet another day home, alone and sad. I didn't actually eat at the lunch but I mean, actually going out is a huge breakthrough for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been thinking of getting Lean Cuisines since they're all under 400 cal and make that possibly the only thing I eat all day. But I fear that the sodium content is really high in most of them. I'm going to look for some with relatively low sodium and keep a few in my freezer. I think having a few of them every week will help my body adjust to going back to eating normal meals if an opportunity comes up for lunch/dinner with friends. Lately with my relapse, I've been avoiding going out with my friends because, well, I have an eating disorder. But I at least want to start doing that, even if I restrict the rest of the week, because isolating myself has made everything soooo much worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I tried keto this week and it was nice at first, but now I can't stand it. I haven't had enough fibre in my diet, meaning very few BM's, *meaning* major weight fluctuations. Seriously, I can't stand this. I was doing much better when I was still eating carbs (and I mean, super carby carbs like bagels) while restricting and my weight loss was linear, despite a few plateaus. But plateaus are better than my weight skyrocketing up 1.2 pounds overnight! 

Anyways, I'm just going to go back to eating carbs, doing what I was doing at the start of my relapse. Also, the lack of carbs is really fucking with my horse riding. Horse riding is difficult enough while restricting but I feel like, as an athlete, I need carbs to perform well. Plus, I'll be able to restrict lower now that I won't be focusing so heavily on fats. I'm also going to stop counting macros, which will be hard, because it's so easy to check macros on MFP and I know I'll stress about it if they aren't close to being right. Anyways, just needed to get that out there. I love you all so much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really don't like coffee fasting anymore because coffee is so acidic and lately I've become really sensitive to acids. I ended up having 605 calories instead of 415 because I had some tequila. But this morning my weight was 1.2 pounds higher than yesterday! I'm trying not to take this too seriously since I've basically had no BM's in the last 2 days. But I'm going to coffee fast anyways to see if that helps at all. 

Hope you all had a great weekend! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's different for everyone. I had a chubby face until I was 19 years old - despite whatever my weight was. When I was 14 years old and first diagnosed with anorexia my BMI was around 16 but I still had a relatively chubby face, because I was young I guess. Right now my BMI is 21. My BMI was 25 (my face wasn't chubby at 25, it was just like, normal?) at the start of my relapse and only recently has my face started to look sunken. I think a lot of how your face looks depends on how nourished you are, *not* always necessarily what your BMI is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So on Monday I was 112.6 and I was stuck at that weight for three days. Then somehow, despite restricting, my weight skyrocketed to 113.8 on Thursday. Then yesterday it went back down to 112.6. And today it's 112.2. What the fuuuuuck. I am *so* close to my lowest adult weight of 111 but so far. I feel like it's a sign from the universe to stop restricting and get my shit together. But I can't stop. Like the idea of being "normal" with my eating is so foreign to me. It's been 20 days since I've eaten any non-safe foods. I can't even imagine eating normal quantities of food, or even upping my intake to like, 800 calories a day. I think I'm going to do a protein shake fast tomorrow worth ~300 calories to see if that helps at all. I really wanted to be 111 point something by Monday. Gah.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does not help you lose more weight (although there is a small flush of water weight you lose in the beginning). You still have to count calories and you'll still lose the same amount of weight if you restrict to 500 calories on keto or 500 calories on non-keto. 

The biggest benefit of keto is that the combination of fat + protein keeps you extremely satiated for several hours. Sometimes after I have a breakfast of eggs + coconut oil, I'm not hungry for like 5 hours. And also, you won't feel bloated after eating keto like you would if you were to eat carbs. 

It's worth it for some people. On Sunday I started a 1 week trial of keto and it's nice, up until I have to do physical activity. I'm an athlete and I feel absolutely sick to my stomach during keto. I have been told this feeling will pass, but I don't know if I'm going to keep up with keto.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Omg! Honestly!? I made a post last weekend about smashing my scale and the post was at like 25%. Your post is about scales and it's at 50%. Someone seriously does not like the idea of us getting rid of scales!

Anyways, I am SO proud of you. I know how aggravating the scale can be. I would ideally like to only weigh myself once or twice a week. I think after I hit my first GW (which is 110, so not too far off) I'm going to start weighing in just twice a week. 

You're right, the fluctuations are too much to handle. I hate that I check my weight later at night even though I already KNOW my weight is going to be higher than it was when I first woke up, because food and water weight. 

I totally feel you on the measurements thing. A lot of my measurements are getting smaller but the scale either doesn't budge or my rate of loss is sooo slow. 

3 hang in there! Don't fish it out tomorrow morning! You just have tow wait until Monday! </TEXT>

My best friend said that to me when I told her about my recent relapse. It's so fucking dumb. It's like telling a heroin addict to "literally just stop doing heroin."

**"Your body goes into starvation mode and as soon as you start eating again, you'll gain all the weight back."**

Again, something my best friend said to me. Do people seriously think that "you'll gain all the weight back" is going to make someone STOP starving themselves? I know starvation mode is a myth, but if I didn't know it was a myth, I would end up believing her and purposely *not* stop starving myself out of fear that I'll gain "everything" back if I *do* eat. </TEXT>

I usually add salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and dried parsley to the egg whites and mix it before pouring it in the pan. If you're willing to add a few extra calories for butter or coconut oil, it makes it even tastier and the combination of fat + protein keeps you full longer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've found it helpful to give myself permission to binge once every few weeks.

I used to do this as well. Back in 2013 when I relapsed, I'd fast every Monday, restrict the rest of the week, and on Saturday or Sunday I'd allow myself to eat almost anything. I remember one "binge day" it was half a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts. Another day it was like 3 tacos and a burrito from Taco Bell. It kept me sane, it gave me the chance to eat whatever I had been craving all week, and I still lost weight. Another time I went to an Indian buffet and took the buffet to go. I filled the container with whatever I wanted and ate it between like noon and 7pm. That was probably the best type of thing for me to do because I ate until I was satisfied then kept eating every few hours. I never felt uncomfortably full.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really binge per say, as in, I don't eat mass quantities of food in a short period of time until I'm uncomfortably full. But a binge to me is eating any unsafe food or meal. Like, if I go to Taco Bell and get a burrito and two mini quesadillas, that's a binge to me, even though the total calories is at/under maintenance. Or, if I go to a restaurant and have some of the bread, most of my entree and a dessert. I mean, I might feel uncomfortable after a restaurant meal, but it's not as though I lost control at the restaurant. I guess anything that's not restricting is a binge (to me). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So my best friend (who also has/had/is recovered from anorexia) and I have tentative plans to meet up for lunch and shopping tomorrow since I have an appointment at the Apple Store. I am kind of freaking out. Firstly, she is really thin so she's kinda triggering-ish in a way. Secondly, since she is so thin and beautiful, the idea of eating in front of her is terrifying to me. I picked an entree at a restaurant we might go to. If I ate half the entree, it would be 540 calories. Not bad! But I'm still scared. Scared of eating at a restaurant, scared of eating an unsafe food, even if it's the only thing I'll eat all day and be 540 calories, and scared of eating in front of my friend. 

I feel like I'm out of excuses with her and, having had an ED, I feel like she can see right through my excuses. She and I got our nails done together yesterday and later that day I was texting her regarding me freaking out about having to nourish myself if I horse show. She replied saying it's obvious I had lost a lot of weight in the last 2 weeks alone. So I don't know. 

Part of me feels like being honest with her and saying "You know I'm really struggling and the idea of eating at a restaurant and it's really troubling me, do you think we could skip the lunch part and maybe just do drinks and shopping instead of a meal?" BUT I'm afraid that might trigger *her*.

Really, I'm just ranting. But any advice is welcome. Love you guys 3 </TEXT>

Holy shit I just had one of the most intense lessons of my life! My trainer pushed me so hard, she totally kicked my ass. Like, at one point I was convinced she was angry/punishing me for something because she made me work that hard.

I started Prozac today and it's kind of abolished my appetite. I ate at 12:30 and had my lesson from 3:30 to 4:30. It's almost 6:30 now and I'm still not hungry. Gah. I really really wanted to hit 500 calories consumed today but the Prozac! My mood is slightly better but this is kind of counterproductive lmao. But maybe it's not the Prozac because doesn't it take ~2 weeks to really "work"?  </TEXT>
