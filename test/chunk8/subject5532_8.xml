	<TITLE> MEGATHREAD: Consoles not joining games; "Error starting game, trying again" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-13 04:31:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Seen about a billion posts for this issue, including one of my own, so figure I'd try and make a megathread. 

No word on Blizzard on it yet, but hopefully we get something soon. EDIT: Response from Blizzard below!

Mods could we get a sticky to discuss this? Would really help highlight a place to discuss the issue and any potential fixes. Currently a fair amount of console users simply can't get into any games at all. 

UPDATE #1: 9:00pm AEST (Australia Eastern Standard Time, ~12 hours since free weekend ended) still can't get into any games. Seems to be fairly contained to Asia-Pacific servers, but not entirely.

UPDATE #2: Almost 1:00am AEST, still can't get into games except for the occasionally lucky one, although I did have more luck in the brawl than in QP. Managed to get in touch with Blizzard CS on twitter and they just said they're still "investigating this issue". Logging off for the night. Here's hoping it's up when I get back up.

UPDATE #3: Patch has supposedly gone through on all platforms and is now fixed! </TEXT>

Games will not join, sometimes I can't even get into training range. WTF is up. I know everyone here is a PC player, however have some sympathy for us consoles players who can't even join any games.

It literally just fails to loads, tried another map, and then fails and repeats. Please at least tell us what is going on. </TEXT>

/s

As the title clarifies, this is for a pointless Mercy rez. These completely exist, and I'm not 'dense' for suggested they do. Even if the rez really would not have made a difference, it can still get POTG. If 3 junkrats commit suicide, then mercy rezzes them, it's POTG. I've tried this and it works. That's not winning us the game, believe me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me and my friends realised that Mercy POTGs were WAY more common than they used to be after the patch, and we had a theory that you could essentially 'force' a POTG as Mercy with any resurrection of 3 or more people.

So we tested it out, and it works... I understand Blizzard have probably done this to allow Mercy to get POTG more often, but something's gone wrong where it now happens way more than it should. 

Pls Blizzard, literally unplayable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed with your sarcasm. Some people get so fucking sensitive. It's not like this happens in every single game. Sometimes this shit just happens and it's funny, regardless of whether it's competitive or quick play.

It's not like you go into quick play with the mindset "oh I'm going to say hi to everyone and just try and disrupt the game by not shooting!" That's obviously not what happened here, it's just a spur of the moment thing.

	<DATE> 2016-08-13 01:45:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For some reason this wasn't in the patch notes, but Zen no longer counts as capturing/contesting a point whilst he's ulting. 


This means you can no longer keep the overtime timer going for the duration of your ult as Zen, which was a great strategy to extend the game and help allow teammates get back to the point after they respawn.

I presume the same goes for pushing payloads, but I haven't tried that yet. 


This is pretty big change, and it shouldn't have gone undocumented IMO. It was great strategy that I used several times :( </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone got an experience using the 360's Gamecom X95 headset on the One? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-12 02:19:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just trying to set this up, and it's a pain in the ass. It used a wireless receiver to connect to the xbox 360 TV audio back in the day, and then had a seperate plug from the headphones to plug into the 360 controller to receive game chat and send the mircophone signal too.


Naturally, because the Xbox controller can now also send game audio, the wireless audio receiver for the TV is unnecessary. The only problem is the wireless receiver needs to be paired and running for the wired mic/controller cord to operate, but that's fine and can be done easily.


Now here'es the problem. I don't own the chat headset thing from Microsoft that comes with the adapter. HOWEVER, I bought a 2.5mm to 3.5mm jack converter off eBay, which should do the same thing when plugged into the Xbox's headphone jack. I even checked the adapter is microphone compatible too, not just audio. However, when I get it all up and running, I get audio through the wired connection with jack converter, but it won't pick up my microphone as a device that can be used. It doesn't even recognise. My computer doesn't recognise the microphone when using the adapter either. Anyone had any experience with this? </TEXT>

After he stuffed up one too many times, he used his mic to loudly belch for all the team to hear and then said "Sorry guys, probs had one too many beeries this arvo". (He's Australian, so say this with a twangy bogan accent)

He still communicated when needed though. If this guy can do it, you can too.  </TEXT>
