So, a couple questions first! What does your existing set up look like in terms of tools/frameworks. Are you looking to build a website or an application? How experienced are you with development?

I know HTML5 and CSS3, as well as a small amount of JavaScript, I haven't used any frameworks yet, and i'm looking to build a website.
I'm not experienced enough to sit down, open Sublime Text 3, and build a website from start to finish XD,
whenever I inspect a page's source code it seems to have a million and one things that i've never come across and have no idea about (shadow-root being just one of many examples), i'm so inexperienced that if I started building a page I wouldn't know when to declare it finished because I couldn't even be sure when it has everything it needs to fulfil the latest standard.
So i'm just looking for a video of a frontend dev building a website from scratch in the last month or two to see what the latest standard is and then build my own sites based on what they did (if there's something else that would help more or as much please let me know :)
