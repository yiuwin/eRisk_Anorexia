	<TEXT> Most of the community here doesn't pay much attention to the pre-70 game because it tends to just be personal preference at that stage. Crusaders are beefy mid-range casters with heavy armor, Wizards are glass cannons, and Witch Doctors tend to let their pets do most of the killing. Except all three of those descriptions overlooks a mountain of complexity offering dozens of possible builds, many of which have nothing to do with that description. I hate to say it depends on your personal preference, but it really does come down to experimenting with what kinds of playstyles you prefer, then finding the class that best suits it.

As for my own personal preference when I'm in the pre-70 push, I've had the most fun with Wizards running Arcane Orb with the Spark rune, just because it's like having a conduit pylon on all the time :) Monks with Exploding Palm are fun as well, since they can wipe out an entire screen if used properly. I'm also told that Witch Doctors reign supreme in trying to get to 70 as fast as possible, though I don't use them often myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love me some set dungeons, but eight is an awkward number to have to master for the conquest because I plan to run a Crusader and I'll be jolly well fucked if I make myself go through the Akkhan or Roland hell again, which means making a third character just to tick a box off the to-do list. I don't mind doing that, but I'd feel better if the conquest was finished with five or six set dungeons so I can pick and choose. Even if the conquest required *nine*, it would still give me the option to opt out of a few once I'm resigned to making three characters anyway. Does that make sense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the initial 1-70 push for Crusader, why run Heavenly Strength? Typically you want to hit as hard as possible, attack speed be damned, so if you can afford to run shieldless and just go with a 2h axe, your DPS would improve quite a lot, wouldn't it? Maybe it's because I'm used to pushing on Hard rather than Master so survivability never comes up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe the devs have talked about reworking Akkhan's set, because LoN has rendered it redundant since it's rather easy to get 100% uptime on Akarat's Champion without it and there's not much it can do that a LoN variant can't do better. I believe in that article there was talk in the comment section about having it buff Phalanx since there's not a viable pet build yet and a number of support items would work nicely with it, but there are numerous other directions they could take it. At any rate, we know for sure that they're thinking about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, thanks for asking! I can understand why people don't like them, for sure. I definitely spent a good amount of time banging my head against a wall for the hardest ones (fucking Uliana and Akkhan spring to mind) but to me mastering a dungeon was challenging the way Dark Souls or a kaizo Super Mario Maker level is challenging. Tough but fair, and with infinite retries with little time lost between each attempt. The payoff was always satisfying in a way clearing a high GR never was, to me at least. Plus I got those fly-ass dragon wings at the end :) Also truthfully, there are a couple of my favorite set dungeons I go back to when I'm bored of the endless GR grind and need a palate cleanser. Usually just the easy ones but occasionally WotW or Helltooth if I'm nasty.

Mastering 8 set dungeons for one seasonal conquest is a bit much, though. I'll probably do it as one of my three, but it really should've been something like five or six for the conquest because I plan to run Crusader for S10 and I'll be damned if I have to do Akkhan's *or* rebirth and balance a third character for the season. Again, I completely understand some people's aversion to them, I just felt the need to say that everyone doesn't speak for everyone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been wanting to talk about this on AskReddit for a while now, so come with me on this journey...

So as you know, the main character Babydoll (we're not told her real name) is sent to a sort of mental institution where she escapes the hell of her reality by regressing into a fantasy world where she and her fellow inmates are captive dancers in a burlesque club/brothel. Babydoll schemes (both in the real world and fantasy world) to get her friends out by stealing certain objects from the male staff and patrons of the institution, the plan being that the girls will do the stealing while the men are lured into a hypnotized stupor by Babydoll doing some sort of primally sexual dance that we the audience never actually see. Instead, we get a third level of the fantasy wherein Babydoll's dancing is realized by the action scenes that comprise the set piece battle sequences. The implication then is that those battles, which are clearly meant to visually reference that particular genre trope of comic books, anime, and fantasy art wherein the so-called male gaze is meant to be excused by how "empowered" its scantily clad female protagonists supposedly are, is basically just a visual metaphor for Babydoll doing what amounts to a striptease.

Think about that for a second. With the exception of the bus driver guy who probably represented the only positive male in those girls' lives, the men in this movie are fucking awful. Disgusting, evil, slimy monsters, the absolute worst dregs of humanity. So what is the movie trying to say here? The warrior princess action stuff is presumably what drew a large portion of its target audience into the theater, so if you (and admittedly me also, the young male geek culture enthusiasts who wanted to see the girls kicking ass in their fetish doll outfits) came to see the action scenes, and those action scenes are a metaphor for gross monsters drooling over Babydoll's striptease, then the male geek's equivalent in the movie's universe is... yeah, that gag would be the titular sucker punch. We're the boorish gross assholes.

"Hey, hey you," the movie seems to say "See this guy here? The guy leering at these girls in their little outfits? This is you. This is what I think of you. And you know how those guys are getting robbed blind right under their own noses while they're busy slobbering over Babydoll? That's me, the movie, getting you into the theater just so I could mock you to your face."

I don't want to say the movie didn't stumble in its execution of that message; the overall presentation was clunky, the metaphor was too obtuse for its own good, and it would have benefited greatly from an R-rating to adequately explore the darker concepts at play, but I honestly think this is what the movie was trying to say, and I think a good number of people got exactly the opposite of the film's intended message simply because of what they saw on the surface. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That seems to happen a lot in movies where the filmmaker opts to go for satire without being an outright comedy. Sucker Punch kinda fell into that trap as well, and although it didn't help that the movie was kinda scattershot with its visual reference pool and lacked focus as a result, it was still disappointing that so many people thought it was misogynist when in a way it was actually the opposite. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sucker Punch, but with a massive qualifier.

This movie was not great in its execution, but I also feel like it took a lot of shit for playing its own satire straight-faced, kinda like how Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers was blasted in its own day as a pro-war fascist propaganda piece when it was in fact a brutal satire of pro-war fascist propaganda pieces.

By the same token, a lot of people seemed to criticize Sucker Punch as misogynist pandering fetishism, but I feel like if anything, the film actually had the most scathing things to say about men. Specifically, the presumably mostly male audience who was drawn into the theater on the pretense of watching cute girls in sexy outfits kill Nazis and dragons, the male gaze supposedly being excused by how "empowered" the girls were. To explain my reasoning why would mean getting into the context of the film, and I don't want to do that right now unless pressed, but basically Sucker Punch lured in a bunch of guys to gawk and the sexy anime chicks, only to end up mocking them to their faces for doing it.

I'm not saying the movie was secretly a forgotten triumph of feminism or that it was even entirely coherent with its message, but I feel like a lot of people who (with good reason) called it out as pandering probably only saw what was on the surface when there was, in fact, a deeper undercurrent of satire running beneath it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another interesting point in favor of Akkhan's is its versatility. If you think about it, a lot of sets don't reach their full potential until after you've found all the support items that go with it. With Seeker, for instance, you're specifically looking out for Blessed Hammer gear, but with Akkhan's during that early item hunt you could find the Blessed Shield flail + the Heaven's Fury bracers + the Condemn shield simply by rotten luck, and Akkhan's will still be helping you in the background to give you an at least functional build. Akkhan's makes a wonderful starter set even if it doesn't keep up with other builds later on in the season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Glad you're enjoying the game!

So the thing that makes the pre-70 push different from the mid- to late-game is base damage uber alles. For most classes this means equipping the heaviest, slowest, hardest hitting two-hander you can find (crossbows for DH, 2h axes for everyone else). For the Crusader it's a bit non-intuitive because Heavenly Strength allows you to have a shield as well, but at the cost of 20% weapon damage. If you think you can do without certain skills that require the shield, consider taking off Heavenly Strength and just using a two-hander in both hands. Your DPS should increase as a result.

As for passives, normally Finery would be a strong choice, but at this early stage in the game gear will cycle constantly and you won't always have sockets or gems, so you may not get the most out of it before 70. Indestructible is always a decent option (and mandatory if you're hardcore), most others depend on the attack you use (go with Blunt if you stick with Blessed Hammer, for example), and if you take my advice and go shield-less, you're free to ignore anything that revolves around Block Chance (again, pre-70. The best in slots change after that). Fanaticism is good if you use Smite a lot.

In general, you don't have to worry about surviving on lower difficulties, so you're free to concentrate on damage and move speed. It's not until the difficulty starts getting cranked up into the Torments that you need to worry about toughness. Hope this helps :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like you've already made up your mind to hate this movie, so in your own mind you'll be "right" that it sucks regardless of what the critics or audiences say. I'm a fan of the original and I'm willing to give this new one a chance at least, because the live-action vs. animated format has very little bearing on the solid premise and intricately woven story I love about it. If nothing else, and the 2017 version turns out to be a shot-for-shot remake, I'll still be glad for the effort because it will have been introduced to a new audience with whom I can engage and share my fandom.

Of course it probably won't be *better* than the original, but I have no reason yet to believe it's going to suck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny thing, I'm actually running my own marine-themed one-shot in a few days. The ship they are boarding contains a number of monstrosities and other beasts that were destined for scientific study or exhibition, but got loose from their cages and ran amok in the decks below. Basically an entire menagerie of feral pseudo-animals including (but not limited to) an Owlbear, Coeurl, Grick, Ettercap, Peryton, Yeti, and Girallon (all of which have a CR of 2-4).

Easier monstrosities closer to your party's level might include Cockatrice, Hippogriffs, or Harpies, but right now I only have the basic Monster Manual to work from, so there could be more in Volo's guide or elsewhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stick with me; we're in for a long one. I feel like this is relevant with the new movie coming out.

I've always been concerned about the passage of time in Beauty and the Beast for the cursed characters. They said in that song that they'd been that way for ten years, but how do you explain Chip, the little teacup kid who's clearly seven or eight? Either time passes slowly for them, or Mrs. Potts had to have pushed a cup out of whatever teapots have instead of vaginas.  So yeah, I can buy that the characters age more slowly, but time is not frozen for them (or else the Beast would never reach age 21). This implies the Prince wasn't 11 when he was cursed, probably closer to 18 or 19 (which explains why he would have a portrait of his adult self in the west wing). This will be relevant shortly.

Do you remember what the human version of Mrs. Potts looks like? No amount of time dilation hand waving can excuse the fact that she's way too old to have a child Chip's age, and yet he calls her Mom. Not aunt or nanny, but Mom. It seems likely to me that Mrs. Potts is not Chip's biological mother but assumed that role while Chip was an infant, almost as if she was helping cover something up.

So whose child is Chip? Probably not the other castle denizens; there's an entire subplot about Lumiere trying to get his little waxy pricket for that feather duster maid, so nobody really seems to care that the Help is fucking around. No, there is only one character for whom it would be a legitimate scandal to reveal evidence of a lurid affair with common townspeople, other nobles or, dare I presume, a jilted enchantress?

Remember, in the original Beauty and the Beast tale, the Prince was cursed because of a scorned lover. It's entirely plausible that the Prince (again, 18 or 19 years old at the time) had a whirlwind romance with an attractive and mysterious young witch, produced a bastard, tried to cover it up by forcing the maid to adopt him, and cut off ties with the mother. Now *that's* a motivation for a pissed off sorceress to curse him and everyone he knows, or at least a better one than "because he refused to let a creepy stranger in his house when his parents weren't home". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but LOTR had the benefit of having been written to tell one single narrative rather than three. Therefore, the first movie was largely expository set-up, the second was rising action, and the third was the thrilling climax and resolution (about 45 minutes too much resolution, sure, but that's fair enough when you have as much sprawling internal mythology as Middle Earth does). Modern trilogies have to balance that escalating threat with each installment being its own full narrative to stand on its own. </TEXT>

I know my players very well, and I can pretty much guarantee no one's played that game. I have a few days so I'll probably be making some changes anyway. I think to drag it out a bit more I'm just going to provide them the poem and puzzle and just let them figure it out from there. 

The Dragon's Den is just an abandoned former smuggling ring I'm only going to have them enter so they can have a rest safely in the middle of a long dungeon. As long as the phrase has the same number of characters, I'm sure I can find something else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First some context: the party approaches a heavy impenetrable door with no apparent knobs or levers. Chiseled into the door is what appears to be an arrangement of letters and symbols, each on its own space in a linear sequence. Inscribed above the board game is a poem explaining the rules of the game. Apparently a secret message is encoded in the jumble.

"Skip ye three or skip ye five,
Toward the center ye arrive.

Forward, backward, either way,
But don't re-tread the spots ye play.

Though there are many stars in space,
No spaces here; stars take their place.

Speak the words contained herein,
To pass into The Dragon's Den."

@.+TKE.SHY.U++DIRDSRY.U++O+FYBASL+OTIOED..Y..!

It's difficult to illustrate here, but that sequence is arranged in an inwardly spiraling pattern; the "center" in the poem refers to the exclamation at the end. Starting from the @ symbol, the idea is to move either three or five spaces in either direction, and take the letter you land on to form a pass-phrase that will open the door. For example, the first letter will either be T or E. The stars (+) represent spaces between the words, but the periods merely represent blank spaces that had to be included to make the puzzle work, and are ignored. Once a letter or star has been used, it can't be used again (it just becomes another space to be skipped). Ideally I'd want this puzzle to stump the party for about 20-40 minutes real-time; does anybody think this is appropriately challenging? I'd love to know how long it takes people to solve it without looking at the answer below.
