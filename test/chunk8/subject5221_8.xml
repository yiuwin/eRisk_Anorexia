	<TEXT> Wouldn't it be cool for TABS to have a freeze time button? Easier to catch cool action filled screenshots in a massive battle when there are cannonballs in mid air clashing into one another above a front row of shields trying to hold against footmens. Or even a ~~slow motion and and~~ fast forward function. Or a replay mode? Just throwing ideas out...

[EDIT]
Just found out about the slow motion. Other ideas tho... </TEXT>
