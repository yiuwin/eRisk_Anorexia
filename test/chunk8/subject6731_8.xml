	<TEXT> It is amazingly difficult to give a good impression of what a DMT-analog trip feels like. Indeed, DMT is easier an experience to describe!  For one, every trip is different. While a couple of times MET has made me horny in the extreme, other times I feel pretty normal after taking it, while other times I feel pretty out of it. Visuals on MET are mild.

MPT I have done three times. First time I described in a thread on the topic. The next time I did about 40mg and then redosed 25 minutes later with about 20mg more. It was slightly visual, mostly mental; I greatly enjoyed it. But the third time was quite difficult; my friend puked a great deal and the lights at the park, which are usually on, were all off, which together set the darkened tone for the trip. The headspace is rather friendly, I'd say, and the visuals are not scary in the slightest like on DPT.

I would not be able to tell that there was any special relationship as it were between MET and 4-HO-MET versus any other psilocin or DMT analog. They are each quite unique in their own ways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 4-HO-MET is best before bed. You won't be at the point of running around the house naked and screaming, which I take it is a good thing for you (those can be good trips, really!), nor will you be too noticeably intoxicated depending on your dose. I would recommend 15mg for such a trip, one which will also not keep you up too long, unable to sleep. Also, if you snort it, the duration is only about 2.5 to 4 hours.

4-AcO-DMT is, I think, a little too intense if you are wanting to do it at home with parents around, as it sounds from the OP. The intensity increases exponentially, so unless you have a very precise scale, the difference between a "breakthrough" and a fun, friendly adventure is only a few little specks of dust.

4-HO-MiPT is another that might be okay at home. I've only ever done this one out in the forest, which I would say is the best place for it. Truly deserves the name, "Alien Shrooms"!

Perhaps you are looking for something a bit briefer? In that case I would recommend MET or MPT. I recently had an amazingly powerful EPT trip, but EPT is hit or miss; sometimes it'll be fun other times it'll feel very disappointingly mild. MET or MPT out of a meth pipe will last about 45-60 minutes, the plateau being the first 25 and the comedown the next half hour. You must do this with  the understanding that you will be very high within 5 seconds of taking the hit.

	<TEXT> K-Holing, in my experience, has been the most DMT-like; indeed, even more so than DMT! 

An extreme dose of 4-AcO-DMT, maybe 4-HO-MET, could also have such an effect.

I don't agree with the others who named DPT, it has never done that to the extent of my experience therewith; however, my friends who have done DALT (I'm too chicken) report the feeling as akin to DMT and equivalent in duration, but usually as too overwhelming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you find it adds something negative, but is there any positive reward in your experience? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Kratom and 4-sub tryptamines </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Anybody ever try to mix them? In my experience, the trip is usually very mellow but also milder than without the kratom. I've never had a bad trip with this combination, nor have I ever had a wonderful trip. The lack of stress, however, is a very warmly appreciated effect of the synergy between these two substances. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No cause to worry. 4-HO-MET can be taken in relatively large doses without too much discomfort (that is, 120-150mg). Color is quite insignificant. The stuff I've seen is a beige color and have always experienced total bliss thereon. </TEXT>
