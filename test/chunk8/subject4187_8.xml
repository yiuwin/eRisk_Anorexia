	<TEXT> Circle move is one of my favorites. Whips are also one of my go to moves. What I like to do is do the circle move then break it apart while doing it and transfer the momentum from the circle move into whips.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just mess with my hands a lot throughout the day. One of my favorite ways to learn/improvise new moves is to practice to music. It helps A TON with musicality (speeding up or slowing down with the tempo/hitting beats in the song) and actually performing in front of people (mirrors are awesome).  

Also try to get outside the box with the basic moves you know in order to create new moves. For instance, I like to disconnect my hands while finger rolling and treat them as two different entities while still keeping the same "flow" as if my hands were still connected as one finger roll.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dramamine really helps. First time I took it by itself and it was uncomfortable nasusa but still had a enjoyable mind high. Second time I read about taking Dramamine 30mins before the Lsa would help with the nausea, so I tried that. It basically took most of the bad body side effects away and I had these MDMA like waves of energy/euphoria, it took me off guard but it was incredible and that was only a low dose (3 hbwr seeds).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I spend my free time going on erowid.com and looking at all of the different drugs and drugs trip reports there haha. I love that site to death. 

...to live with the benefits of having visited the psychedelic headspace.

I 100% agree, some people die without ever discovering that part of their mind. It's amazing to have experienced something that beautiful in life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gel caps did come across my mind a few times. If I do end up getting more I'll try that for sure. 

The powder in your mouth does get uncomfortable. Gets stuck between your gums/teeth/braces.  I would put some water in my mouth, mix it and then the kratom and the swallow.  One time I put the powder in my mouth first...... holy fuck never again, it was the dumbest shit, was coughing for at least 10 mins straight. Haha learned my lesson.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, when I was first heard of Kratom it was when they were trying to Ban it so I got a decent amount of it. Not too much but a good amount of it. 

When I got it I tried it and it was awesome (not the taste though lol) , I loved the relaxed state it put me in and so I used it more and more daily. 

Fast forward like 6 or so weeks of constant use and I went cold turkey on it and started to have withdrawal symptoms (headaches and restlessness were the main annoyances) which plagued me for about 3 days. Going to sleep and functioning normally was a uphill battle during those 3 days and it wasn't fun at all. That was my first time having withdrawal from a substance. 

During that whole experience I thought to myself "Wow, this sucks. This is only Kratom, imagine if this were a heroin/other opiate withdrawal, it would be a lot worse then it is now",  which honestly I couldn't imagine the hell that would've been. 

So it wasn't the same "mind opening, one with the universe" type experience you would get with LSD/DMT/Shrooms, but it did teach me to not fuck with opiates and to moderate my Kratom use in the future if I happen to buy anymore. 

Edit: Also I know Kratom isn't technically an opiate but it does act on the same receptors that opiates act upon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yeah, I feel the same way.

I started off smoking weed as well and that completely changed my life for the better. I started to see drugs and life in a totally different light than I did before. After weed I've done other drugs (LSD, 2-CB, MDMA, DMT/Aya, LSA, Adderall, Kratom) and with every single experience I have felt like I have gained a new perceptive on reality even with "minor" drugs like Adderall and Kratom. 

There are some drugs I do wanna try (Shrooms for example, maybe K and a higher dose of DMT/Aya) but there are drugs that I never want to touch like other pharmaceuticals, Meth, Heroin, etc. 

I do feel like there will be a point where I don't need to do them anymore because I will have gotten all of the "information" from them that I will ever need, and I also don't want to get to the point where drugs are the main focus of my life; I want my sober state of mind to be just as enjoyable (if not more enjoyable) than my state of mind on any drug. 

I also think it is very important to implement the things you learn from these substances into your life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  With this, weed in the wrong setting can be bad for some people just like with psychs.

Exactly. The people that are all like "Bro what are you even talking about, weed isn't psychedelic at all, how are you having a bad trip stop being weird" get so annoying. They think that just because one fat bowl of some good weed only gets them mildly stoned it will do the same for the next guy, then they call the guy out for "being a pussy" or whatever when they say "they're good".

	<TEXT> I'm sorry that happened to you. People like that give us vegans a bad name with all the preachyness. I mean it's good to inform people but there is a certain point that you don't cross and most vegans IMO cross that point constantly . I like to inform people if they ask me a question about being Vegan and every single time I've had positive feedback doing that instead of being a passive aggressive ass.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a crush on this girl when I was in 8th grade. One of my friends had a class with her so I had the brilliant idea that I should write a note that said "Hey this is subject4187 do you want to go out with me" with a "Yes" and "No" at the bottom and told her to circle one and then give it to my friend to give to her during class. 

After the class my friend gave me the note back with "No" circled about a thousand times to the point where you couldn't even tell if the word "No" was there. So basically my day was ruined. It was even more awkward that she was also a woodwind player during high school band class so I basically had to see her all the time. I don't think I said a single word to her throughout high school after that.  </TEXT>
