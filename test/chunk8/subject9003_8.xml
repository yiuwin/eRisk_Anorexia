They get close to 5' and spent the weekend in a hotel. Spring Break woo!

	<TEXT> One time I was forced to lead. It was on a bike but it is the same situation.

I'm biking up one of my favorite climbs. I've done it countless times. I was planning on averaging 13 mph. My pr is 14.5, I'm sore, yesterday was a big day of climbing.So, I'm gonna take it easy.


At the bottom of this climb I see this guy. He's old. He's going at a snails pace. I sped up to 17 mph as I passed him and I held that for a hundred meters or so. I thought I got some distance on him but I notice something. There's this shadow that's following me. I turn around to see that this is Ned Overend. A mountain biking legend, who just so happens to live where I do. 


I wanna drop him. He's not gonna pass me. He's just gonna sit on my wheel. I start with an attack but he held on. I picked up the pace and then attacked, he held on. This kept going on. At one point, we were going 17 mph up a 7% slope. I couldn't imagine doing that before but every time I looked back there was a 59 year old man looking fresher than a daisy. 

The road flattened out before this one, very short, 10% wall. I dug deep and went into the red because that was the end. I drop Ned at the beginning of the climb but he catches me on a flat part of road and smokes me on the descent.

When he passed me he spoke for the first and last time. "This is where the fun part starts!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If that reporters investigation is grounds for the claim "everyone is microdosing", you are wrong. What he showed is it is POSSIBLE to beat the system. It is a modal claim, not a prescriptive one. 

In a conditional it could be written as:

 If everyone is microdosing, they will pass the biological pass port. 

Or

 M  P
 If M
 Then P. 

This argument form is just a modus ponens. 


If you were to say:

 M  P

 If P

 Then M

You would be affirming the consequent, which is one of the two formal logical fallacies. That is what you said. Let's not affirm the consequent and talk about the mere possibly of microdosing in the pro peloton. We cannot say thay they are doping or that they or not </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's quite the assumption. If I were some High Schooler, would that mean my comments have less strength because it comes from a high schooler?

Also FartToast, I used to get migraines a couple times a month. I have to call out of work, lay in a dark room and just lay there until its over. I'll faint if I stand up for more than a minute. I'll get sick until theres is nothing to come up and then its just dry heaving. Sometimes that lasts two days.

A simple tension headache is not something you can compare. I'll tell my boss that I'm having a migraine and I need to have someone cover. She'll just say, "whats wrong? I have a migraine and I'm working right now." I have to explain the difference and then she gets it.


Too many people equivocate the terms. A migraine is a very difficult experience that most people try to relate with when they really cannot. That is no different than going up to a chemo patient and saying "yeah I had the flu once, I know how you feel", when you really have no idea what its like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be hard unless you have had a similar experience. Everything was extremely detailed and bright. I was mountain biking in the middle of the night up this gulgh and my light died. I discovered I didn't need a light because I could see everything. I would occasionally stop for what felt like hours but I when I would continue moving and check back into reality, the same song was playing. That happened a lot.

This mountain started spiriling into itself. It kind of looked that mountain from *The Grinch*. Rocks shine colors that I had never seen before but I some how am able to recall them now. It was very iridescent and strangely purple.

I felt like I had an unlimited source of energy. I just kept going and going. I went for a 15 mile ride and followed it with a ten mile walk. I went to work later that day still beaming with energy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> CEFHCL understood that concern. His comment directly addressed it. Now this is getting circular. Also, we are discussing two different forms of ethics (or grounds for deciding what makes an action good or bad). 


The UCI puts rules in place to prevent poor consequences. The idea of allowing the act because it is based in a good maxim is deontological. So the debate really boils down into the consequentialist/deontology debate. 


This sub generally has some good debates but this is an ethical debate. You bet we need to have a good debate and not hold any view so dear that we wouldn't be able to abandon it if it were clearly the weaker view. 


It's a shame that Richie was docked two minutes. Clarke's sentiment will undoubtedly be acknowledged in cycling history  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The town I grew up in was beautiful in the fall when the leaves changed. It was a small town, just a couple thousand people. It sat on the Hudson River and was easily accessed from New York City by a 50 minute train ride. At 10:15 AM on the Saturday of "peak color week" as declared by the New York, there is a line of Asians flooding up Main Street to this one tree. At least a couple hundred Asians congested the one stop light where the tree sat adjacent to. 

It was a beautiful tree on the lawn of a 400 year old church but goddamn did the Asian tourists love it. They always asked for directions to this one particular pizza place. Being the asshole of a teenager that we were, we sent them to random buildings in town and had them knocking on the doors </TEXT>

I was at fault. Driver got a new door because "I dented it". I hit the hood of the car. He got a new door two weeks later. I fought his insurance company for five months before they sent a $17,000 check for $24,000 worth of hospital bills (not to mention a $3,000 bike). The fucker got a new door before my skull fracture healed  </TEXT>

It's just up the road from the Colorado trail's trailhead. This is 10 miles up that road, or just past the animas overlook. It's a great climb if you don't mind the dirt! </TEXT>

Hi Mod for comparison. It's a really stiff frame and smooth too. I doubt most consumers would be able to tell the difference between a high end Chinese carbon frame and a high end Cervelo frame. 


I would totally recommend this frame in particular. The cable routing was pretty easy, it looks nice, and has ridden well thus far. I've only ridden it 40 miles so I couldn't say much.  </TEXT>

Your flair says your from Colorado. I'm guessing you live in the front range where you have the option to ride flat stuff. There are five ways out of my town and all but one involve a couple thousand feet of climbing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because I'm getting a tattoo sometime soon, I am asking people for their opinions and experiences with artists in town. My experiences thus far have been mixed. I got a simple tattoo at your flesh but the experience was great. Skin inc is on my no fly list and blue dragon is on my no tattoo list.

I want to get an oak tree on my calf/foot, possibly integrating a wren into it. I have some ideas about what I want it too look like but I want an artist to bounce ideas off of. 

Who would you recommend for not only the tattooing but designing a tattoo? Who's creative, good at listening, and skilled? or should I just go to a reputable shop in a big city? </TEXT>
