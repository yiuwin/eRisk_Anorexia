	<TEXT> This relates to a container into which liquid is flowing at a constant rate. A hole in the container allows liquid to flow out at the same time. 

It is fairly straightforward to derive an expression relating the height of the water to the rate at which water is flowing out (the outflow rate being proportional to the squareroot of the height of the water). However I'm trying to derive an expression to findthe time it takes to fill the container to it's optimum height (e.g. when the input flow rate matches the output flow rate), and this is the part I'm having real trouble with. Any tips\suggested directions appreciated. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! I clearly need to work on my integration. 

Any tips on integrating that expression? It's not covered by the standard integrals I know. I've used WolframAlpha, which gives an [answer](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+%281%2F%28A-Bx%5E0.5%29%29+dx), but I'd like to be able to work it through for myself. 

edit: I'm trying to a result giving x as a function of t, if that helps.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Given a differential equation in the form

dx/dt=a-bx^(0.5)

I've tried the integrating factor here e.g. e^-bx but I end up lost - I've been told that the solution is relatively simple, which makes me think I'm doing something drastically wrong.  

I cannot see this is a seperation of variables equation either as there is no function of t, f(t), involved. Even I take f(t) to be 1 (e.g. a constant), I cannot seperate the V on the RHS.

	<TEXT> Still tripping balls after a 2 day acid binge, I suddenly remembered a job trial I'd arranged at a local bar. Propelled along to start this job by an overactive sense of responsibility, whilst not actually being able to see\focus properly, I rocked up to begin my evening shift.

Never worked behind a bar before, and remarkably held it together when shown how to pull pints. When I tried pulling pints for customers though, as soon as I started, the glass started overflowing, so I stopped. My vision stopped messing about, I looked again, and the glass had only a drop of beer and was nowhere near overflowing, so I tried again. Rinse and repeat. After spending what seemed like an hour, but was probably 5 mins, sorting just one drink, I decided bar work wasn't for me. Told my manager I want feeling too good, and staggered off home. For more acid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> UK here: I took my bank to court around 8 years ago, claiming that all of the bank charges they levied on me were disproportionate, and excessively covered their costs beyond a reasonable limit. Statute of limitations meant I could claim back only 6 years, but I won and the bank had to pay interest as well. Took back around 4000. Now my wage at the time was poor, and one charge led to another, which snowballed leading to yet more charges. Of course, there was a degree of responsibility on me, but I was not helped (until I met a reasonable branch manager) in the least by my bank. Felt good to do something about it, hut a shame that banking practises can lead to this action being necessary to begin with.
