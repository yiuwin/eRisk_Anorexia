	<TEXT> I've had cause to mention this one on /r/AskHistorians before, but it nevertheless remains one of the most touching and powerful examples of its kind from the period in which it was written.

Some background: *The Wipers Times* was a largely satiric British newspaper famously published in the trenches during the First World War on a printing press that had been liberated from the ruins of a French town. It was by the infantry and for the infantry, and much of it was marked by a very dark streak of humor indeed.

Nevertheless, there were contributions that were amazingly sad and touching, too. The poem To My Chum, written by an infantry private of the Sherwood Foresters who had lost his friend, is impossible to read without at least a twinge of sorrow. I say this charitably  for my own part, at least, I can barely get through it at all without tearing up.

**To My Chum**

    No more well share the same old barn
    The same old dug-out, same old yarn,
    No more a tin of bully share
    Nor split our rum by a star-shells glare
    So long old lad.

    What times weve had, both good and bad,
    Weve shared what shelter could be had,
    The same crump-hole when the whizz-bangs shrieked,
    The same old billet that always leaked,
    And now  youve stopped one.

    Wed weathered the storms two winters long
    Wed managed to grin when all went wrong,
    Because together we fought and fed,
    Our hearts were light; but now  youre dead
    And I am mateless.

    Well, old lad, heres peace to you,
    And for me, well, theres my job to do,
    For you and the others who are at rest
    Assured may be that well do our best
    In vengeance.

    Just one more cross by a strafed roadside,
    With its G.R.C., and a name for guide,
    But its only myself who has lost a friend,
    And though I may fight through to the end,
    No dug-out or billet will be the same,
    All pals can only be pals in name,
    But well all carry on till the end of the game
    Because you lie there.

We may compare this (I leave it to the reader to determine whether favourably or not) to something like Siegfried Sassoon's "The Poet As Hero" (first published in *Cambridge Magazine* in 1916) which was motivated by similar feelings of grief and loss:

**The Poet as Hero**

    You've heard me, scornful, harsh, and discontented, 
       Mocking and loathing War: you've asked me why 
    Of my old, silly sweetness I've repented 
       My ecstasies changed to an ugly cry. 

    You are aware that once I sought the Grail, 
       Riding in armour bright, serene and strong; 
    And it was told that through my infant wail 
       There rose immortal semblances of song. 

    But now I've said good-bye to Galahad, 
       And am no more the knight of dreams and show: 
    For lust and senseless hatred make me glad, 
       And my killed friends are with me where I go. 
    Wound for red wound I burn to smite their wrongs; 
    And there is absolution in my songs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not wishing to steal anyone's thunder, but I had occasion a while back to write a sort of overview of the man's career in /r/AskHistorians. You can [check it out here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16ftk1/was_gk_chesterton_a_particularly_influential/c7vs0dw/), if you like.

That being said, newcomers might enjoy his Father Brown mysteries (especially "The Oracle of the Dog," "The Blue Cross," and "The Sign of the Broken Sword" -- the latter a very non-traditional detective story indeed), *Orthodoxy* (his treatise on religious optimism and love of happiness), *The Club of Queer Trades* (in which a detective investigates "crimes" related to an unusual group of people who have all invented wholly novel professions for themselves), and many of his poems -- most notably "The Last Hero," "Lepanto," "Ballade of a Suicide," etc. Essays like "A Piece of Chalk," "On Skeletons" and "In Defense of Rash Vows" are also nice points of entry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are five that may be of interest to you, though in no particular order apart from the first:

1. Adolfo Bioy Casares' *The Invention of Morel* -- An Argentine novella in which a fugitive on a mysterious island discovers layers within layers of experience, to ultimately heart-breaking effect. This 1940 text would end up being influential to such works as *Myst*, *The Prisoner*, *Mysterious Island* and *Lost*, among others. It is the closest thing I know to a perfect book, and I recommend it unhesitatingly to absolutely everyone.

2. Rebecca West's *The Return of the Soldier* (1918) -- A beautiful and meditative English novella about the home-front experience of the First World War, as written from the perspective of one confined to that environment during the war itself. Its contents are as interesting as its context: the story is about the catastrophic return on leave of an infantry officer who has lost twenty years of his memory, and the impact that this has upon his young family. The text itself was the first novel from the pen of a young woman who had been socially ruined by her affair with the much more popular novelist H.G. Wells (of *War of the Worlds* and *The Time Machine* fame), and who had been forced to flee to London's outskirts to bear and raise her illegitimate son, Anthony West. She would end up having a last laugh of sorts, but, at the time, things were very difficult for her indeed. Still, the story only benefits from this, and is probably the best contemporaneous home-front writing of the entire war.

3. G.K. Chesterton's *The Napoleon of Notting Hill* -- The year is 1984, and an oppressive government crushes England beneath its heel through violently enforced homogeneity and media manipulation. However: this is Chesterton rather than Orwell, and it was published in 1904 rather than 1949; consequently, the novella that unfolds is a testament to the ferocious rebirth of the human spirit rather than its dismal destruction.

4. Thornton Wilder's *The Bridge of San Luis Rey* (1927) -- In which a rope-bridge in Peru collapses with a number of people being killed in the process; a monk subsequently attempts to make sense of the tragedy and piece together the lives of those involved in it. 

5. Alan Bennett's *The Uncommon Reader* (2007) -- In which Queen Elizabeth II accidentally becomes a voracious reader of transgressive/insightful literature, and ends up influencing the Realm accordingly. A very funny little book with a totally unique subject, and well worth the hour or so it would take to read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's talk about Basil Liddell Hart (1895-1970) -- veteran, military historian, strategic theorist, polemicist.

A remarkably popular figure in his day, and still amazingly influential and widely published even now, Liddell Hart's strategic theory of the "indirect approach" has been taken by many as a ground-breaking reappraisal of the causes and conduct of the infantry stalemate of the First World War. His ideas were widely admired, and seem to have had some impact on the thinking of certain German generals in the inter-war period.

Where he figures in your inquiry, however, is that Liddell Hart could with some justice be said to have become the *de facto* "pope" of First World War historiography from the 1930s until his death in 1970. It was very hard for other historians in England -- particularly younger ones still making their names -- to get their manuscripts published without them first having been examined by Liddell Hart and given his imprimatur.  The consequences of this were sometimes quite arduous: Liddell Hart's ideas about the "proper" interpretation of the war and its conduct were idiosyncratic, even if widely hailed, and he did not respond well to those who offered alternate views. On several occasions he is known to have instructed friends of his to produce "independent" "reviews" of books to which he objected -- using his carefully prepared notes -- to be published in a variety of periodicals with the aim of consequently creating a "consensus" that the book was a failure and should not be taken seriously. The English military historian John Terraine was one victim of such treatment, though he'd have the last laugh (of a sort) in the end.

Indeed, it was the involvement of the likes of Terraine and Correlli Barnett in the production of the unprecedented 26-episode BBC documentary series *The Great War* (1963-64) that saw Liddell Hart resign from his position with the production and announce as much in a scathing public letter. His objections were varied, but some centered around the series' treatments of Sir Douglas Haig as a person and the Somme Offensive as a campaign; Liddell Hart, like many of the establishment historians of the time (such as A.J.P. Taylor), firmly believed the former to be an incompetent monster and the latter to be an irredeemable catastrophe, so a counter-example urging greater nuance did not please him much.

Still, this nuance really has won out in the field of military studies, if not yet entirely in that of cultural memory. The next generation of military historians -- among them Terraine, Barnett, Brian Bond, Richard Holmes, Gary Sheffield, Dan Todman and William Philpott -- have been more cautious in their historiography and less willing to start from a position of naked outrage and then work their way back. We can see a sort of last gasp of the other school in 1988 and 1991, with Denis Winter's *Haig: A Reassessment* (it wasn't) and John Laffin's *British Butchers and Bunglers of the First World War* (the title alone...), but the views of the historians listed just above are beginning to take the field. Neither of the books just mentioned now commands much attention, and some of the claims of the first have been quite thoroughly assailed.

Unfortunately, the position of the "Lions Led By Donkeys" myth so industriously propagated by Liddell Hart is quite firmly entrenched in the popular memory, and military historians continue to have their work cut out for them.  

If you'd like to know more, Alex Danchev's biography of Liddell Hart is probably the most accessible. </TEXT>

The *Pickelhaub* worn during the First World War was made of leather, at first, often with a thin cloth cover. The spike itself was in no sense hard enough or sharp enough to function as a bayonet or spearpoint of this sort, and it only became less so as the war went on and the spike transitioned into being made of tin, paper, or even felt. The spike itself vanished relatively quickly with the introduction of the *Stahlhelm*, and infantrymen who left records do not seem to have felt themselves deprived of a vital martial advantage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know why the idea of Lovecraft in Canada -- and in Quebec especially -- seems so incredible to me, but I'm happy to hear about this all the same. It's tangentially interesting to me on a professional level too, as I've been idly compiling notes for several years now about the history of British authors travelling to Canada during this period (Kipling's and Chesterton's tours are probably my favourite), and this would make an interesting sidebar of sorts.

 published-but-unindexed letters

Oh man, *thank you*. These were the most frustrating thing for me back during my MA. If we're thinking about the same edition, it's the five-volume *Selected Letters* series released by Arkham House, right? I was determined to make the most of them for a paper I was writing about HPL for one of my seminars, and actually skimmed through all five volumes in an attempt to have at least the semblance of due diligence. I've retained virtually none of it, unhappily, but it made for a few days of deeply interesting reading.

Incidentally, I just wanted to say how great it is to have another "literary history" flair join the team here. Thank you very much for your work. </TEXT>

This intrigues me. Both of the people I've heard this from said this is exactly when it had happened, but I wasn't confident enough in my knowledge of Lovecraft to say that he had ever left the U.S. for any reason and so didn't include it in my initial comment. Did Lovecraft end up in Montreal during any of these visits? Leacock taught at McGill until his forced retirement in 1936. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may be the one to ask a question that's been tugging at me.

I do a lot of work on the Anglo-Canadian humourist/economist Stephen Leacock, who happened to be a contemporary of Lovecraft's. I have heard from two other scholars -- one working on Leacock, one working on Lovecraft -- that the two of them met at some point and that Lovecraft admired some elements of Leacock's work. In neither case was I provided a direct citation for this... just something they had read somewhere.

Well, I'd very much like to read that somewhere myself, if I can, but I've so far had no luck locating any proof of their meeting or even knowledge of one another. There's admittedly no reason at all that Leacock would ever have heard of Lovecraft, but the reverse cannot really be said: Leacock was hugely popular in the United States from the 1910s through the 1930s.

I've been through all existing biographies of Leacock, his letters, and what archives I've been able to access -- no evidence to be found on this side of the matter, at least. I'm curious to know if you might have stumbled across anything in your own work, though.

Of possible interest: Lovecraft's "Sweet Ermengarde" seems to be a note-for-note tribute to or parody of Leacock's celebrated "Nonsense Novels" format in the 1911 collection of the same name that cemented his reputation in the U.S. Certainly it parodies other things as well (Horatio Alger novels, for example), but the format is so familiar that "Ermengarde" could almost have been written by Leacock himself.

Anyway, this is just starting to ramble on a bit; I'll bring it back home: do you have any evidence that H.P. Lovecraft ever met Stephen Leacock, or that he left any recorded opinion of him or his works? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks very much for your replies!

1. I think calling it an *Anti-Passchendaele* makes a lot of sense, and I will own up to a great deal of personal satisfaction at seeing new work that undercuts that one. I don't think *Passchendaele* has assumed the place in the Canadian cultural conversation about the war that Paul Gross might have hoped, but it's still on a lot of people's minds. Glad to see that there's an intended counterpoint to Yale Harrison and Remarque, too; it's tangentially interesting to me that Canadian teachers so often give their students *All Quiet* even when a Canadian version of the same thing is so readily available.

2. Your view of that exchange is much more genial and positive than mine, I must say! Part of what kept me out of it was the worry that I would be unable to engage in it without ending up being rude to someone in a subreddit that I'm supposed to be curating.

3. Ah! That makes a lot of sense, and is a pretty excellent idea for quick and plausible name-generation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for doing this!

1. Where do you see your book fitting into the wider field of Canadian literary writing about the war? There are so many of them that focus on the concerns of the home front and of non-combatants, in various ways, so yours seems to be falling more into the legacy (if not the intent or "tone") of something like Charles Yale Harrison's *Generals Die in Bed*, Timothy Findley's *The Wars*, or even Vern Thiessen's play, *Vimy*. Is *Killing is a Sin* placed in any sort of indirect dialogue with work like this? Is it (he says, hopefully) maybe meant as a sort of antidote to anything? 

2. I saw (but decided not to intervene in) a short but intense debate between you and some other users in /r/WWI the other day over how the Somme -- and by proxy the war itself -- is properly to be understood. Is this the sort of debate you've encountered regularly throughout your career as a military historian? What about as a soldier? I have no doubt that it's going to come up again for you as a novelist, too, but I'm sure you're quite aware of that yourself!

3. A rather light question, but... is your character's name perhaps a nod to Sir Hew Strachan? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sort of skirts the boundaries of sci-fi, but the story "The Chymist" in Thomas Ligotti's *Songs for Dead Dreamers* may be up your alley. It involves a scientist telling a woman he has met about an unusual new drug he's working on -- more than that I will not say.

	<TEXT> I'm disappointed to hear this evaluation of the book, but not at all surprised. Prof. Lynch is a big name in my own field for many excellent and quite real reasons, but he has been known to overstep things a bit in his popular writing. Seeing this focus on dictionaries doesn't really shock me either, given his past areas of inquiry; he made quite a name for himself with his work on Samuel Johnson's dictionary, for example.

A very pleasant fellow, at least on the one occasion on which I got to meet him (he had served as a supervisor for a colleague's doctoral thesis, and had come to the department to give a guest talk on the history of the anecdote as a concept, which was fun), but possibly not the ideal author for this particular subject. I have no doubt whatever that **some** English professor could do a fine job with this, though -- but I'd still prefer someone in the library sciences. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> And with what value might that correspond today?

I've been reading about Chinese labourers on the Western Front during the First World War, and was intrigued to see that the French Franc was the currency of choice for their pay by both French and British overseers. I'm a bit hazy on the precise amounts being paid between labourer and family, comparatively, but I do know that the French offered 50 Francs to each labourers' family in addition to whatever the labourer was paid, while the British paid each labourer 1 Franc per day. Labourers for the French were given Sundays off and accorded the same rights as white labourers; those working for the British worked seven days a week, with time off only being given for Chinese festival days.

All involved were determined to avoid any suggestion of the indentured servitude that had marked the labour of the Chinese for certain European powers in bygone years, so these pay structures were admirably enforced -- but what were they actually worth in terms that make sense to my dismal modern brain? </TEXT>

1. We return to the Young Indiana Jones days during his service in the First World War -- only this time, instead of the trenches, he ends up in German East Africa on the trail of Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Things take a turn for the expected, however, when Indy discovers that the German general's reasons for being in the jungle aren't all that they seem...

2. Indy is dispatched to find Col. Percy Fawcett and his missing expedition to the Lost City of Z in Brazil. Indy finds him alright -- but he also finds that Fawcett and his men have good reasons for staying "missing"...

3. During the Second World War, Indy is kidnapped by the Soviets and forced to help them locate the tomb of Tamerlane, who fully expect that claiming his bones will bring victory to whomever holds them. Of course, once the tomb is opened, it turns out that the terms of the prophesy are a little bit different...

I am probably going to have much more to ask about things related to this book (Robinson's, that is) in the days to come, as it has thoroughly unsettled my otherwise serenely modern, Western mind, but the matter of Ibn Khaldun seems the most pressing.

Where does he stand in modern historiography -- especially where the East is concerned? How were his ideas received during his own life and that of his works? Is there a widely-accepted translation of the *Muqaddimah* that you'd recommend? I've been working off the Princeton one so far, and it's been absolutely spellbinding (if very obviously -- and occasionally satisfyingly -- medieval). </TEXT>

In my field, for example, there are perhaps five dedicated positions available this year in all of North America. Maybe I have a shot at one of them? I don't know, probably not -- and my field is actually *better off* than many.

Are you prepared to start publishing peer-reviewed articles in top journals from the first moment you begin your doctorate? Are you prepared to have a book deal by the time you've done your degree? Are you prepared to court -- and even embrace -- mental illness and social isolation and poverty for year after year, with no guarantee of any pay-off whatsoever? Are you prepared to do all of this and then find out that you have no chance at all because your department never had the funding to give you teaching and syllabus-design experience? Are you prepared to discover that every position to which you've applied was created with a specific internal candidate already in mind, and that even your job talks and interviews are literally a consequenceless (and expensive) farce? Are you prepared to have to undertake dozens of extra-curricular outreach tasks without any consistent sense of which ones actually matter for your future prospects? And are you prepared to do all of this while remaining the butt of jokes told by other disciplines?

Getting a Masters in English is a fine idea. Getting a PhD with the goal of becoming a tenured professor absolutely is NOT. Even magic beans would be more reliable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've said this in threads about this movie before, but that's actually what I liked *most* about *Knowing*. It's one of the very few films I've ever seen where the information that's given to the protagonist is just... information. It's a warning that something is going to happen, not an invitation to stop it from happening. Literally, "knowing" is all you can do.

For a movie that unfolds -- and, especially, ends -- in the way that it does, I found that pretty audacious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A conclusion in which the paper just... ends.

A good conclusion doesn't just wrap things up, and it shouldn't just provide a recap of what's been argued above. A good conclusion takes what has been said and creates a new foundation for future thought. What are some questions that the paper's findings occasion? What are some new directions in research or inquiry that could occur as a result of what the paper says? What are some things that have fallen beyond the paper's scope, for whatever reason, but which nevertheless remain interesting and potentially important?

A good conclusion, in short, will recapitulate the paper's general argument while also pointing outward. </TEXT>

It has been my experience that their blog is of tremendously mixed quality, and also that the pieces that appear on it often get posted without going through any sort of editorial approval first. Certainly their literary articles that have appeared in print in the past have been much better than this, for the most part.

This piece is so bad, and lies so far beyond their mandate, that I'm astounded it appeared at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  [And how she gets the Eggos and food that Hopper left in the box, I don't know.](/spoiler)

[I'm a bit late to this discussion, and probably reaching, but I think there are two suggestive things about the food situation that suggest how El might receive what Hopper leaves.](/spoiler)

[First, and most importantly, everything in the real world (world prime? topside?) seems to have an analogue in the Upside Down. All the same houses and buildings and so on are there, and in the same locations; lots of "stuff" can be found there too, like the contents of Castle Byers or of the Byers' living room, albeit covered with that weird growth. I posit that the food Hopper leaves in the box creates an analogue in the same location in the Upside Down, and El can find it there somehow.](/spoiler)

[Now, obviously not everything has such an analogue; the most clear counter-example is people, so far as we know. I'm on shakier ground here, but I think the fact that the food is left *in the dark* has some importance here. The show has put so much emphasis on light and darkness in the contrast between the topside and the Upside Down, especially when it comes to lights being used to communicate between the worlds. It's possible that things that happen in the dark -- whether in the literal dark, or in the subconscious, or in secret -- translate more aggressively into the Upside Down somehow.](/spoiler)

[Or, more simply, there are still random portals to the Upside Down in certain parts of the woods, and that's why Hopper leaves the food out there -- just in case. This seems a bit too easy, though.](/spoiler)

All speculation, but still. This show has got me into a more happily speculative mood than anything I've seen recently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This scarcely qualifies, but it still blows my mind:

In England, a brilliant and ambitious young student is determined to make his mark on the world. He marries a wealthy heiress over her father's objections, uses these new connections to secure a position as a member of parliament, and begins his new career as a reformer. He also begins to cheat on his wife; he is threatened with exposure, but puts a stop to it. Dismayed with his own party, he crosses the floor to pursue his reforms with the opposition, but is stifled there as well after having certain promises betrayed. His marriage ends unhappily. He abandons English politics and flees to Italy, there to research a new political system and to begin writing his manifesto.

The question: 

Am I describing the entire plot of H.G. Wells' *The New Machiavelli* (1911)? Or am I describing the actual real life of the English fascist Sir Oswald Mosley from c. 1920 through 1933? If Wells had simply written a novel based on Mosley's life and career, that would be one thing -- but this is *the other way around*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe, but it does do a number of really audacious things that I ended up enjoying. 

Apart from the sheer ludicrous marvel that is the ending (and I mean everything about the ending, from the doom to the white tree), I genuinely *loved* that the film subverted one of the most common tropes in stories of this sort without even blinking an eye: the hero uncovers the pattern and discerns the secret message. 

In any other film, there'd be something he could do about it -- the whole story would hinge upon him somehow stopping what was going to happen because of his privileged insight into this information. Indeed, *Knowing* carries on like that for much of its run time as Cage races from place to place trying to prevent disasters before they happen.

But *Knowing* takes that idea and just flushes it down the toilet. There *is* a pattern, and it *does* provide information, but... that's all it does. The message is just a message: "your world is ending; sorry." All of his efforts to stop it are completely futile from the start, and I can't think of any other film that's had the guts to do something like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as I unrepentantly enjoy that movie, I can't really disagree. It highlights a common problem in film and television (and elsewhere too, I guess) whereby we are required to believe that a particular character is one of the greatest writers who ever lived when their material is very obviously being written by a writer who is *not*.

I call this the Lois Lane Paradox. Terrible things happen when someone who only writers superhero comics tries to write an excerpt from a newspaper column (usually something like "Why the World Needs Superman") that is alleged to have won a Pulitzer. The same problem persists in *Stranger Than Fiction*, and is only compounded by Dustin Hoffmann's truly unbelievable English professor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Publish! 

Produce/collaborate on new research and get it out the door -- and do it sooner rather than later. The bigger the head-start you can get on this before you hit the job market, the better. Work on publishable content when you're too burnt out with your main project. Work on it as a hobby. Work on it when you should be doing other things. Present shorter versions of your articles as conference papers. Turn your conference papers into articles.

Your CV is going to need content, and this is something you can (and should) take seriously from the very start. This is especially true given how long academic publishing can sometimes take: it is entirely possible to write and submit something in your first year that won't even end up appearing in print until your third or fourth, ludicrous though it may sound. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition to more conventional jokes, the men found a great deal of fun in creating their own versions of popular songs.

A distinction should first be cast between two different kinds of songs: those that were popular on the home front and in the musical halls, and those that had their origins in the trenches themselves.  The former certainly made their way into the trenches as well -- often with quite surprising additions to the lyrics -- but they were not born there.

I'll list some of the most popular songs in each category and then provide some exemplary lyrics.

**Music Hall**

Songs of this sort were written for popular, public consumption, and often with a patriotic intent.  Lyrics ranged from the winkingly suggestive to the nauseatingly sentimental, and much of the pleasure your average Tommy would take from it came with inventing his own additions or substitutions.

For example, the refrain to Paul A. Reuben's popular ["We Don't Want to Lose You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTJXwOs2_bA) (1914) ran thus:

    Oh! we don't want to lose you
    But we think you ought to go
    For your King and Country
    Both need you so;
    We shall want you and miss you
    But with all our might and main
    We shall cheer you, thank you, kiss you
    When you come back again

The man in the trench, swiftly fed up with this kind of cloying sentimentality, had his own take on the matter:

    Now we don't want to hurry you,
    But it's time you ought to go;
    For your songs and your speeches
    They bore us so.
    Your coaxings and pettings
    Drive us nigh insane;
    Oh! we'll hate you, boo you and hiss you
    If you sing it again.

In a more suggestive strain we see something like Wimperis   Finck's ["I'll Make a Man of You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x308MIPPUyA) (1914), which became a very popular recruiting song early in the war.  One may perhaps see why:

    The army and the navy need attention,
    The outlook isn't healthy you'll admit,
    But I've got a perfect dream of a new recruiting scheme,
    Which I really think is absolutely it.
    If only other girls would do as I do
    I believe that we could manage it alone,
    For I turn all suitors from me but the sailor and the Tommy,
    I've an army and a navy of my own.

    [Chorus]

    On Sunday I walk out with a soldier,
    On Monday I'm taken by a Tar,
    On Tuesday I'm out with a baby Boy Scout,
    On Wednesday a Hussar,
    On Thursday I gang oot wi' a Scottie,
    On Friday, the Captain of the crew,
    But on Saturday I'm willing
    If you'll only take the shilling,
    To make a man of every one of you.

You'll have to pardon me -- my glasses have fogged up, here.  Not content with the promises made above, the soldiers' amended version ran something like this:

    On Monday I touched her on the ankle,
    On Tuesday I touched her on the knee,
    On Wednesday I confess, I lifted up her dress,
    On Thursday I saw it, gorblimey,
    On Friday I put me 'and upon it,
    On Saturday she gave my balls a treat,
    On Sunday after supper, I whopped me fucker up 'er,
    An' now I'm paying forty bob a week!

The clips above come from the darkly satiric 1969 film *Oh What a Lovely War*, which does a great deal to ape the music-hall culture of the time.

Other popular songs included:

- ["Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0wycVPR_nI)

- ["Good-bye-ee"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVavtX80m3Q)

- ["It's a Long Way to Tipperary"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVM-tFAdADg)

- ["Oh! It's a Lovely War"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6RnirpFaZk) 

- ["Roses of Picardy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ87ICmR-2k) 

Of these, "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" and "Pack Up Your Troubles" have had the longest life and the most sustained popularity.  These and the others above would have had satiric versions as well.

**Trench Music**

The most usual mode, as I've suggested above, was one of parody.  This take on "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean" was popular among transport drivers:

    I've been in the saddle for hours
    I've stuck it as long as I could,
    I've stuck it and stuck until I said, "Fuck it,
    My arsehole is not made of wood."

    Sergeant, Sergeant, oh give back my stirrups to me, to me. 
    Sergeant, Sergeant, oh give back my stirrups to me.

While this one, to the same tune, was more broadly applicable:

    My tunic is out at the elbows,
    My trousers are out at the knee,
    My puttees are ragged and frazzled
    But the Q.M. says nothing for me.

    My tummy knocks hard on my backbone,
    My dial is as thin as can be;
    Still all we get handed at mealtimes
    Is bully and Maconochie.

[Bully beef = basically tinned corned beef; Maconochie = a widely-distributed brand of tinned vegetables.]

There were countless possibilities with a tune like this:

    Last night as I lay on my pillow,
    Last night as I lay on my bed,
    I dreamt our old corp'ral was dying,
    I dreamt the old bugger was dead.

    Send him,
    Oh send him,
    Oh send our old corporal to He-e-ell;
    Oh keep him,
    Oh keep him,
    Oh keep the old buffer in Hell.

Even some "official" songs had a harder edge to them.  One of the regimental marches of the Royal West Surrey Regiment, for example:

    Here they come, here they come,
    Silly great buggers every one:
    Half-a-crown a week to pay
    For putting a girl in a family way.

    Here they come, here they come,
    Second of Foot but second to none.
    Here they come, here they come,
    Second of Foot but second to none.
    Bullshit, bullshit,
    Covered from head to foot in it.
    Bullshit, bullshit,
    Covered from head to foot in it.

    [And so on]

The wide-ranging adventures of ["Mademoiselle from Armenteers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfvrrSOkJ3o) were happily recounted by men in every branch of the service:

    Mademoiselle from Armenteers, parlay-voo,
    Mademoiselle from Armenteers, parlay-voo,
    Mademoiselle from Armenteers,
    She hasn't been fucked in twenty years,
    Hinky dinky parlay-voo

    [And on and on, with many variations]

Mademoiselle was not always looked upon with such affection, however, as in "Aprs la Guerre Fini":

    Aprs la guerre fini,
    Soldat Anglais parti;
    Mam'sell Fransay boko pleuray
    Aprs la guerre fini.

    Aprs la guerre fini,
    Soldat Anglais parti,
    Mademoiselle in the family way,
    Aprs la guerre fini.

    Aprs la guerre fini,
    Soldat Anglais parti;
    Mademoiselle can go to hell
    Aprs la guerre fini.

I think my favourite, both for its conciseness and strange pathos, is [this popular riff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ps85649fWk) to the tune of "Auld Lang Syne":

    We're here because
    We're here because
    We're here because
    We're here!
    Oh we're here because
    We're here because
    We're here because
    We're here!

Anyway, there were plenty more like all the above -- including "Do Your Balls Hang Low?", which remains weirdly well-known even today.  Songs of this sort were a constant staple for the troops, who very often had to produce their own music if they wanted any at all.  Interested parties should consult Max Arthur's *When This Bloody War is Over: Soldiers' Songs of the First World War* (2001) for more, though I'm really pleased with how useful the internet is for letting me convey the sound of these things as well as the lyrics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine is probably *Land   Water*, an English magazine that was intended to chronicle the First World War as it progressed. Edited by Hilaire Belloc and Fred T. Jane (of the legendary *Jane's* series of military reference works), the magazine provided readers with up-to-the-minute commentary on the state of various campaigns, replete with maps, interviews, and copious amounts of illustration.

It's an absolute delight to read, given the amount of uncertainty and speculation involved; the war hadn't ended yet, of course, so there is much to be found in the magazine's pages that may seem surprising, short-sighted -- or sometimes even prophetic.

*Land   Water* was not strictly focused on military matters, either; it included opinion pieces, reports on home front conditions, fiction, poetry, reviews of the latest war books, and tributes to famous persons who had been contributing to the war effort.

My favourite part, though, is the advertisements. It is not often the case today, but back during the war there was a tremendous tendency to inflect advertisement through a military lens. There were obvious things like recruitment ads and war bond drives, but even things like pens, phonographs, and automobiles were promoted in a martial fashion. Also fascinating are the number of consumer goods expressly designed to be purchased by or for soldiers -- better guns, better clothing, better binoculars, etc. [It's all very charming, in a way](https://archive.org/stream/countygentlemanl01belluoft#page/n23/mode/2up).

Some enterprising hero at the University of Toronto has digitized the whole run of the magazine, and it can be found in its entirety on Archive.org. There's some confusion over just where the first volume ought to begin, but [it's basically accessible here](https://archive.org/details/countygentlemanl01belluoft). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're after a book that goes beyond the Western Front while still offering a variety of material, I must recommend [Matthias Strohn's *World War I Companion*](https://ospreypublishing.com/world-war-i-companion), a marvelous collection of essays put out by Osprey in 2013. They range far beyond the usual, covering everything from the war in the air to the French army's struggles with tactical tradition to the German occupation of the Ukraine. The authors are all excellent, and the essays it includes are all reflective of the most modern schools of thought. I hope that it will be of help to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll leave out *Gallipoli*, *Lawrence of Arabia* and *All Quiet on the Western Front* given that they should go without saying, and I'll note that not all of these are included strictly for accuracy.

1. *Deathwatch* (2002): I'll start off with a not-entirely-serious one.  This remarkable film (which features Andy Serkis and a young Jamie Bell) takes No Man's Land on the Western Front as a backdrop for a tale of supernatural horror.  Very good production values, though everything in it is rather exaggerated.

2. *Journey's End* (1930): An Anglo-Amerrican adaptation of R.C. Sherriff's famous play (1929), this engaging film tells the story of a few British soldiers who share a dug-out, and manages to convey in equally competent fashion the danger, boredom, and camaraderie of such a life.  You can watch it in full [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvqDPt-KGcs).

3. *Joyeux Noel* (2006): A remarkable film about the "Christmas Truce" of 1914.  I'm somewhat ambivalent towards the Truce itself, but the film is extraordinarily good.  Very, very much worth watching.

4. *Paths of Glory* (1957): For my money, this is Stanley Kubrick's finest work.  An adaptation of Humphrey Cobb's famous novel of the same name, *Paths of Glory* tells of a failed French attack on a heavily-fortified German position and of the punishment meted out by their superiors upon the men who could not succeed.  Mesmerizing.  Haunting.  Watch it.

5. *The Battle of the Somme* (1916): Arguably the first feature-length "war movie" and also arguably the first blockbuster, this film -- produced by the Committee for War Films -- uses a mixture of real footage and re-enactments to tell the story of the opening stages of the enormous Somme Offensive, which was still in progress at the time of the film's release.  You can read more about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/190jz6/historians_which_novel_film_song_or_other_piece/c8jw2s2), and watch it in full [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krT1lX_Dvm0).

6. *Westfront 1918* (1930): A bleak, harrowing film about a group of German soldiers trying to survive the meat-grinder of the Western Front.  This is **essential viewing**, if you can find it, as it offers a direct German counterpart to the American version of *All Quiet on the Western Front* that came out the same year.  G.W. Pabst was a rather more nuanced director than Lewis Milestone, too, so *Westfront* has the advantage of a more subtle construction than its more famous contemporary.

7. *My Boy Jack* (2007): A TV movie, but very well done for all that.  This adaptation of David Haig's play of the same name tells the story of the life and death of John Kipling (Daniel Radcliffe), Rudyard Kipling's son.  He died at the Battle of Loos in 1915, having only been at the front for a day or two, and the impact of his demise upon his jingoistic father was profound.  A sad, interesting story.

8. *The Lost Battalion* (2001): Another TV movie, but also good -- this one offers an account of the astounding actions of the men of the (American) 77th Infantry Division under Major Charles Whittlesey.  Cut off from their lines and surrounded by the German army in the Argonne, the men of the 77th fought an amazingly robust and bloody battle for survival.

9. *Passchendaele* (2008): This Canadian film is audacious in its scope, but sort of a failure in its actual execution.  It was a labour of love, but that's not enough to save it from being a melodramatic mess.  Still, it's pretty much the only film on its subject that we have, and the production values are quite good.

10. *War Horse* (2011): Yes, it's a maudlin exercise based on a children's novel, and yes, it's been heavily criticized by historians who look upon it as just more of the same old thing -- but still, it's a well-made and moving meditation on the war through the lens of the experiences of a single horse.  

I don't feel like writing them all up, but others to consider include *A Very Long Engagement*, *What Price Glory?*, *The Dawn Patrol*, *Hell's Angels*, *King and Country* (a very sad and provocative story), *Beneath Hill 60*, *Oh What a Lovely War!*, *Johnny Got His Gun*, *The Blue Max*, *Flyboys* (silly, but often at least fun) and *The Red Baron*.

Also! As far as television series go, you might consider: 

- *Wings* (British airmen on the Western Front)
- *Parade's End* (an intellectual man copes with the tensions between the home front and the battle front -- this description doesn't do it justice, I'm sorry) 
- *Birdsong* (the recent two-part adaptation of Sebastian Faulks' popular novel) 
- The second season of *Downton Abbey* 
- *To Serve Them All My Days* (shell-shocked lieutenant becomes history teacher at a private school in the English countryside -- just lovely) 
- *Testament of Youth* (tales of a British nurse, based on Vera Brittain's amazingly popular memoirs) 
- *The Village* (small English village near the coast endures various hardships; begins in 1914).  
- The *Young Indiana Jones* series has a number of WWI-based episodes as well -- including one, *Trenches of Hell*, which offers up some really harrowing recreations of infantry combat on the Western Front.  Well worth a look!
- *The Wipers Times* (BBC series about the making of the titular trench newspaper; quite moving as well)
- And a host of them from 2014, including the likes of *Great War*, *37 Days*, *The Ark*, and others

The gold standard for documentary work on the war was set in 1964 with BBC's *The Great War*, a twenty-six-part series of hour-long installments chronicling the war from its origins to its aftermath.  It has [a complicated legacy](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gl0rs/tuesday_trivia_worth_1000_words/cal9e2n), but it's still very much worth experiencing.  Documentaries produced in the intervening years have been of varied quality, though the one overseen by Sir Hew Strachan in 2003 (*The First World War*) has much to recommend it.  There was a very interesting recent BBC documentary about mapping the Front from the air (called, I believe, *The First World War from the Air*, or something like that), and only a week or two back BBC4 aired a very interesting new documentary about Winston Churchill's WWI career (*Churchill's First World War*).

Other documentaries to consider include the episodes of Richard Holmes' *War Walks* dedicated to the Western Front (he has ones on the Somme, Mons, and Arras, that I can remember), *Last Voices of World War One*, *Not Forgotten: The Men Who Wouldn't Fight*, the *Secret History* episode about "Britain's Boy Soldiers", and the two *Remembrance Tales* about Wilfred Owen and Rudyard Kipling, respectively.  There was another good one about Vera Brittain's wartime career as well, called (I think), *In Love and War*.

Finally, and to my mind most importantly, there's the *Timewatch* documentary hour from 1996: *Haig: The Unknown Soldier*.  This was a very important and controversial production in that it was one of the first widely distributed TV documentaries to highlight [the historiographical shifts](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hfffk/monday_mysteries_contested_reputations/cattizk) that have taken place regarding Sir Douglas Haig's reputation over the years.  It featured a number of leading historians (many of them still active and prominent today) providing a variety of perspectives on the field marshal and his career, and I cannot recommend it enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The development of the English Mills Bomb is a good example of this. Many of the grenades in use at the start of the war were of a totally *ad hoc* design -- often little more than used jam or coffee tins that had been filled with explosives and old nails. The earliest manufactured grenade to see use by the British infantry (the Mk. 1) had been based on an older Japanese design, and was terribly unreliable. Its long handle and considerable 2-lb weight made it more of a liability than a boon, and something had to be done.

The War Office solicited new designs, and among the thousands received was that of one William Mills. The so-called Mills Bomb, after several rounds of development, would be in active service by the summer of 1915. Its familiar pineapple shape has become something of a stereotype for grenades everywhere, and its efficacy was considerable: some 70,000,000 were deployed throughout the course of the war. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  an extra question, have there been any notable wargames, as in military exercise tools, not toys, in the same period? Like for example British commanders playing a serious "what if" about, say, the Somme, trying to come up with alternative theories or maybe testing new ones.

This is something that was at least engaged with in fiction. In the 1930 novel *The Cavalry Went Through*, the brilliantly unorthodox General Duncan has his men constantly playing a little table-top war game of his own invention, designed to get them thinking in different ways about trench combat and coming up with new ideas. The game does end up bearing fruit, and many audacious and unexpected results are achieved because of it.

Now, the book is also a work of alternate history -- culminating in an Allied victory and march to Berlin in the summer of 1917 -- so this should be taken with a grain of salt. It was something that was at least on some people's minds, however. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition to Dux's answer, it is worth considering that: 

- The 1960s was the era in which a generation of historians who had grown up reading the works of the 1930s came into professional eminence. 

- 1964 saw an enormous new burst of interest in the war on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary. This year also saw the opening of the first of a series of official wartime archives that had been sealed for fifty years, thus providing scholars with acres of new material over which to pore.

- There's also the tremendous influence of the English historian Basil Liddell Hart. I'll crib from an earlier comment of mine for some more detail here:

 A remarkably popular figure in his day, and still amazingly influential and widely published even now, Liddell Hart's strategic theory of the "indirect approach" has been taken by many as a ground-breaking reappraisal of the causes and conduct of the infantry stalemate of the First World War.  His ideas were widely admired, and seem to have had some impact on the thinking of certain German generals in the inter-war period.

 Where he figures in my opprobrium, however, is that Liddell Hart could with some justice be said to have become the *de facto* "pope" of First World War historiography from the 1930s until his death in 1970.  It was very hard for other historians in England -- particularly younger ones still making their names -- to get their manuscripts published without them first having been examined by Liddell Hart and given his imprimatur.  The consequences of this were sometimes quite arduous: Liddell Hart's ideas about the "proper" interpretation of the war and its conduct were idiosyncratic, even if widely hailed, and he did not respond well to those who offered alternate views.  On several occasions he is known to have instructed friends of his to produce "independent" "reviews" of books to which he objected -- using his carefully prepared notes -- to be published in a variety of periodicals with the aim of consequently creating a "consensus" that the book was a failure and should not be taken seriously.  The eminent historian John Terraine was one victim of such treatment, though he'd have the last laugh (of a sort) in the end.

 Indeed, it was the involvement of the likes of Terraine and Correlli Barnett in the production of the unprecedented 26-episode BBC documentary series *The Great War* (1963-64) that saw Liddell Hart resign from his position with the production and announce as much in a scathing public letter.  His objections were varied, but some centered around the series' treatments of Sir Douglas Haig as a person and the Somme Offensive as a campaign; Liddell Hart, like many of the establishment historians of the time (like A.J.P. Taylor), firmly believed the former to be an incompetent monster and the latter to be an irredeemable catastrophe, so a counter-example urging greater nuance did not please him much.

 Still, this nuance really has won out in the field of military studies, if not yet entirely in that of cultural memory.  The next generation of military historians -- among them Terraine, Barnett, Brian Bond, Richard Holmes, Gary Sheffield, Dan Todman and William Philpott -- have been more cautious in their historiography and less willing to start from a position of naked outrage and then work their way up.  We can see a sort of last gasp of the other school in 1988 and 1991, with Denis Winter's *Haig: A Reassessment* (it wasn't) and John Laffin's *British Butchers and Bunglers of the First World War* (the title alone...), but the views of the historians listed just above are beginning to take the field.  Neither book now commands much attention, and some of the claims of the first have been quite thoroughly assailed.

 Unfortunately, the position of the "Lions Led By Donkeys" myth so industriously propagated by Liddell Hart is quite firmly entrenched in the popular memory, and with the centenaries fast approaching the military historians are going to have their work cut out for them.  We'll see.

 In the mean time, anyway, I provide my own little widow's mite against Liddell Hart and the historiographic orthodoxy of which he was the chief architect.

If you're interested in reading more on the role of the 1960s in the development of the war's historiographical orthodoxy, the works of Jay Winter are a good place to start. He calls this the "Fifty-Years-On Generation" of scholarship, and has much to say about it in the introduction to *The Legacy of the Great War* (2009), among other works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pt. II:

 Who are your favourite poets? Poems? 

I think that Sassoon, Rosenberg and Grenfell are my favourites, though I have complaints about all of them -- Sassoon's perpetual sneering, Rosenberg's exhausting lyricism, Grenfell's pomposity. I have a soft spot for Guillaume Apollinaire as well. All the same, Sassoon's "The Dragon and the Undying," linked to in the other comment, is my very favourite WWI poem.

 I think we're all familiar with the more famous war poets like Sassoon and Owen, but are there any we might not have heard of? 

I've already mentioned Rosenberg, Thomas and Grenfell, but you may also be interested in Charles Hamilton Sorley and Ivor Gurney. John Buchan published some verse about the war as well, as did Thomas Hardy and (rather more prolifically) Rudyard Kipling. Hardy's is all exquisite -- though I'm one of those few poor souls who think he was a better poet than a novelist, so I guess I WOULD say that.

There are many others worth reading whose names have now been lost to us. I recommend checking out [E.B. Osborn's *The Muse in Arms* (1917)](https://archive.org/details/museinarmscollec00osbouoft), one of the earliest anthologies to focus specifically on poetry produced by those on active service.

 Finally, I remember at my primary school, we used to have 'singing assemblies' which were essentially giant singing lessons. I remember we sang old war songs like 'We're Going To Hang Out The Washing (On The Siegfried Line)' and 'Goodbye-ee', but I don't remember much else about them. Were these sung in the trenches? Were they popular songs on the radio?

Songs like these, made popular in the music halls, were amazingly prevalent in trench life. They would indeed be sung, or (if possible) listened to on one of the many brands of portable phonograph that were manufactured for trench service -- Decca had one that was particular widely used, and which spawned [a charming ad campaign](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCPQuBEUwAADoBq.jpg). Many of these songs did not survive unscathed, I should say; it was common for them to be given new (and invariably more bawdy) lyrics by the men once the tunes had become well-known. If you're interested in what a trench concert might have looked like, the recent BBC production *The Wipers Times* did an excellent job capturing (if somewhat exaggerating) the aesthetic. Check out [one such set of performances here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz2rmhCleL0); the clip seems to be meant to highlight one actor's performance in a series of scenes, but it suits our purpose well.

	<TEXT>  I'd like to know about your favourite WWI literature.

Well, let's see...

- John Buchan - Author of the famous Richard Hannay wartime adventure novels (i.e. *The Thirty-Nine Steps*, *Greenmantle*, etc.) and eventual Governor-General of Canada; served as an intelligence officer and correspondent on the Western Front before being brought back to England to work for the War Propaganda Bureau and eventually become Director of Information.

- Wilfred Owen - Though he was known as a poet only to a select group of friends and colleagues (and his mother) at the time, his sensitive, finely-wrought, sometimes quite savage poems have become some of the most widely-read literature to come out of the war.  Killed at the age of 25 in November of 1918, mere days before the Armistice.  There are too many poems from which to choose to give a good sense of his work, but "[Dulce et Decorum Est](http://users.fulladsl.be/spb1667/cultural/owen/dulce-et-decorum.html)" is probably the most iconic. I would hardly call him a favourite, though -- in fact I have something of a grudge against him, pompous little prick that he was. Still, he has arguably become *the* poet of the war.

- Siegfried Sassoon - Another of the "trench poets," though also widely-known for his *Memoirs of an Infantry Officer* (1930) and subsequent works.  His poetry is absolutely amazing, and - unlike his friend Owen - he survived the war by many decades.  It took a considerable toll on him, however, and he spent the rest of his life obsessively re-evaluating the experience, in one way or another.  His opposition to the war, its aims and its conduct famously began with his "[Soldier's Declaration](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Finished_with_the_War:_A_Soldier%E2%80%99s_Declaration)," first published in the *London Times* in July of 1917.  In spite of his disillusionment and eventual association with the pacifist movement, Sassoon's career as a soldier during the war was one of remarkable and quite ferocious success.  In any event, his poetry is typically pretty good; here are [some selections](http://www.radix.net/~bbrown/sassoon.html) from *War Poems*, and this - "[The Dragon and the Undying](http://www.bartleby.com/135/4.html)" is my favourite.

- Wyndham Lewis - One of the leading sources of Modernist energy in both literature and visual art.  Served as an artillery observer, and later as one of the official "war artists".  His paintings are [deliberately hideous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LewisAsTheTyro.jpg), but seriously fascinating, and his prose more than lives up to the same description.

- Rupert Brooke - One of the few men on this list to have been quite popular even before the war began, even though he was young.  Brooke was a poet of considerable talents whose works early in the war reflected the ferocious enthusiasm of the general public and found a more than willing audience on the home front.  He survived early action in Belgium, but died of illness en route to Gallipoli in 1915.  "[The Soldier](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/1914-v-the-soldier/)" is probably the most famous of his sonnets.

- Edward Thomas - A Welsh poet and essayist; little of his work deals with the war itself, but he won distinction as a well-known author who volunteered in spite of his age.  Killed during the Battle of Arras in 1917.

- Julian Grenfell - Yet another poet (they do tend to pop up in this period) along the patriotic, enthusiastic lines of Rupert Brooke.  Killed by a shell in the spring of 1915.  Check out his "[Into Battle](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/html/1807/4350/poem894.html)" for a sense of what sort of work he produced.

- Robert Graves - Poet, essayist, novelist; a rather amazing character, and author of one of the more popular (though highly sensationalized) WWI memoirs, *Goodbye to All That*.  Survived the war and went on to write more prose on hundreds of subjects than anyone could easily consume in a lifetime.

- Edmund Blunden - Another poet/essayist/scholar; best remembered for his memoir, *Undertones of War*, and for his subsequent career as a literary critic.

- Erich Maria Remarque - Best known as the author of the classic *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929).  Presents an interesting case; while much is made of the searing authenticity of *All Quiet* and the manner in which Remarque's own experiences as a soldier informed it, he in fact served for just over four weeks in a quiet sector before being wounded in the shoulder by a piece of shrapnel and sent home to convalesce for the rest of the war.  He would later be censured for posing as a decorated officer.  The book is still quite good, though, if overdone in spots.

- Isaac Rosenberg - A young Anglo-Jewish poet of considerable talents, though his work was not widely discovered until long after the war's conclusion.  Like Wyndham Lewis above, he was also an accomplished painter.  Killed April 1st, 1918.

- Frederic Manning - An Australian expatriot who found friendship and acclaim in London literary circles in the years leading up to the war.  His novel/memoir, *The Middle Parts of Fortune*, is still celebrated for the manner in which it combines eloquent prose with brutal honesty - to say nothing of how unsparingly it captures the rough speech patterns of the typical working soldier.  Survived the war.

- Ernst Jnger - The war saw him get his start as an author, as his journals from his time as an infantryman in the German army formed the basis for *Storm of Steel*, one of the most famous books to come out of the war, and a notably earlier production (1920) than those of the great wave of publication that started in 1929.  Far from being disillusioned by the war, he reveled in it; his experiences informed his growing interest in a philosophy of violence and wrath that would see him produce works like *On Pain* and *Battle as Inner Experience*, extolling the arrival of the modern fighting man and the terrible - but great - things of which he was capable.  Went on to become a widely-published novelist, philosopher, entomologist and public intellectual.

- Ford Madox Ford - Already famous as a novelist, poet and critic at the war's outset, he initially served the war effort by working with the War Propaganda Bureau.  Growing disenchanted with the work, however, he made the extraordinary decision to volunteer for the infantry instead.  He served from 1915 onward, survived, and went back to his work as a prolific author and magazine editor. Check out his *Parade's End* tetralogy; it's magnificent.

- Richard Aldington - A remarkable character.  Heavily involved in the Imagist movement (sort of a precursor to Modernist poetry, and involving many of the same key figures), he nevertheless volunteered for service in 1916, fought, was wounded, and returned home a much more delicate and bitter man than he had been when he left.  The key work from him on this is the 1929 novel *Death of a Hero*, but he produced a great deal more than just this, and in many different directions.

- T.E. Hulme - Another member of the Imagist circle, and a rising star in the world of aesthetic philosophy (attracting praise from no less a personage than Henri Bergson - quite an achievement for one so young).  Volunteered as an artilleryman at the war's outset, and kept up a steady stream of essays and poems as the conflict continued.  Killed by shellfire in 1917.  Of all the men listed so far who died in the war, it is Hulme, I think, who might have had the most profound impact on the world afterward if he had lived.  If you can find the volume *Speculations*, which is a collection of his more important essays on humanism, art and violence, it is well worth the time to read.

- Edith Wharton - Best known for her stories and novels of Gilded Age New York (like *The Age of Innocence* and *The House of Mirth*), she spent most of the war in France assisting displaced refugees.  Unusually for a female author at the time - and especially for one not formally working as a nurse or ambulance driver - she made many trips to the Front itself, and wrote widely of the things she saw and did.  Her novella *The Marne* appeared in 1918, intended to encourage her American readers in their country's decision to participate in the war; *A Son at the Front* - a more ambivalent and elaborate work - appeared in 1923.

- May Sinclair - A well-established novelist, critic, and leading suffragette.  Volunteered with the Ambulance Corps in Belgium and wrote extensively about the experience.  She served during some of the hardest fighting of the war's early days (and was not at all a young woman at the time), and she had to return home before 1914 was up - an early victim of shell shock.

- Vera Brittain - Served as a nurse during the war, and her journals from this period (which encompass as much tragedy and nobility of spirit as anything experienced by anyone throughout that war, I think) would form the substance of *Testament of Youth* (1933), one of the acknowledged classics when it comes to memoirs of the period.

I'll have to handle the replies to your other questions in a separate comment -- too many characters! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is there a particular piece of WWI in media that you find absolutely appalling?

*Blackadder Goes Forth* was a hugely important part of my youth, as was *Blackadder* in general.  I watched those things into the ground, and still maintain a degree of affection for them even after all this time.  It was sharp, funny, well-produced, and (to my mind at the time) extremely daring in its approach to something that I viewed as an unutterably stupid event -- that is, the First World War.

I do not view the war in that light anymore, however; not by a long shot.  The more and more I read of it, the less and less impressed I've become with every element of *Blackadder*'s approach to it.  What seemed daring turns out to be stale -- more slapstick-heavy than something like *Oh What a Lovely War!*, but not saying anything especially new.  What seemed to be a dramatic and cutting-edge approach to a conflict that my simplistic public school education had taught me was "good for Canada" turns out to be a tired mixture of 1960s historiography and 1930s disillusion.  There were times when these were quite novel -- but not in 1989.

Many have objected that it's only a comedy.

Yes, it's a comedy, but it's a comedy with a long and enduring reach.  Without wishing to go on for too much longer than I already have, I'll let the English military historian Brian Bond do the talking (from *The Unquiet Western Front*, 2002):

 Should this highly successful television series [...] be taken seriously by cultural and military historians?  [...] As early as 1994, at an international conference in Leeds, the *Blackadder* series was cited as serving to 'perpetuate myths which persist in the face of strong contrary evidence'.  As already mentioned, it was employed as an introduction for the television programme on Haig in 1996 [*Timewatch*'s "Haig: The Unknown Soldier", first aired July 1st, 1996 -- subject9371] and in 2000 it was popularly voted number nine in *100 Great Television Moments* for the most memorable television events of the century (only one other fictional episode made it into the top ten).  Some schools are now using *Blackadder Goes Forth* as the main text for study of the First World War at General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) level.

Bond notes elsewhere in the same book that -- when the Haig documentary mentioned in the passage above was aired -- several newspaper critics subsequently responded by angrily (and without even the pretense of being informed, it seems) insisting that *Blackadder*'s depiction of Haig was more *really* true than anything those stuffy old historians could come up with.

Anything with *Blackadder*'s depth of cultural penetration is going to work upon the popular consciousness.  Most of the people I've asked about what work of art most shapes their understanding of World War One have responded with either *Blackadder* or McCrae's poem "In Flanders Fields", and the former seems to have been born out in a formal survey conducted by the BBC (which I don't have at hand at the moment, alas), in which something like half of the respondents cited *Blackadder* as their primary window onto the war and its meaning.  The series' final episode (which is authentically moving in spite of its comedic nature) has become a November 11th viewing ritual for many in the English-speaking world.

If the people involved in *Blackadder*'s production were willing to disclaim any hint of telling the truth about the war, that might be one thing, but Elton, Curtis, Atkinson, Fry et al. have gone on record in dozens of interviews as saying that, for all that it's a comedy, it really gets to what the war was *really* like -- which was a stupid farce -- and what it was *really* about -- which was nothing in particular.

I am so sick of "*really*" I could scream.

As far as *Blackadder* goes, there are fine treatments of the series' complicated impact upon cultural memory in Emma Hanna's *The Great War on the Small Screen* (2010) and Daniel Todman's *The Great War: Myth and Memory* (2005).  See also Gary Sheffield in the opening section of *War, Culture and the Media* (1996).  Of these, Hanna's is easily the best.

So yes, to answer your question in brief, I do believe that its perpetuation of that tired stereotype has actually done harm to the public understanding of the war.  I also think it's going to continue to do so, and the only consolation I can see is that by the time we hit 2018 the viewing public will be so sick of seeing it rerun every few months that there'll no longer be any stomach for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ***World War One in History, Art, and Games***

Today is July 1st, 2016. Our Canadian friends will (I hope) forgive us for providing this distraction from their national holiday, but our business here is instead occasioned by a particularly important military centenary.

On this day, one hundred years ago, the Somme Offensive began. Hundreds of thousands of French and British troops advanced along a long front near the Somme river in a bid to break through the German lines and force a new development in a war that many feared had already become stagnant. While many hoped for a full breakthrough and a rout of the German lines, those in command would settle for the attack relieving German pressure on the French at Verdun and forcing the German army to spread out rather more fully than the sector had otherwise demanded.

The Somme has come to be a byword for the war itself, at least as far as the Western Front is concerned. The opening of the offensive was preceded by the largest artillery barrage the world had ever seen: a full week of explosive carnage loosed upon the German lines, with hundreds of shells exploding each minute for 168 straight hours. The effect was incredible; quite apart from the physical dangers imposed by the artillery itself, German infantrymen faced the threats of starvation and dehydration as they spent days confined beneath the earth. Some went mad.

At 0730 on July 1st, 1916, the British, the French, and many of their colonial satellites advanced. The artillery was supposed to have destroyed all resistance, and the British front was supposed to have been cleared (for even heartier measure) by the explosion of ten enormous mines that had been dug beneath the German lines. Not all of these mines successfully went up, and one was even detonated early (at 0720) in a misguided ploy to allow the British to occupy the crater more swiftly.

By the time the day was over, some 20,000 Allied troops were dead, and another 40,000 injured or missing. Many of the days goals were left unfulfilled, though it was not the total failure that subsequent accounts have described. Whats more, it was only the beginning  not the end; as John Terraine has rightly noted, the first day on the Somme was the 132nd day of the Battle of Verdun, and both campaigns had rather a long way to go before they would conclude.

This Panel AMA, while inspired by the opening of the Somme, is not restricted to it. Readers are welcome to ask questions about any aspect of the war they wish  from the opening days of 1914 to the many post-Armistice problems that endured into the 1920s. Our panelists are also willing to answer questions about the wars place in art, literature, and even games. Yes, Battlefield 1 questions are welcome!

As always, keep it professional and interesting. Our participants will do their best to address every question posted, but can make no guarantees.

**Participants:**

- /u/an_ironic_username is here to discuss the Great War at Sea. He is comfortable discussing the surface and subsurface campaigns of the warring powers, and their greater influence on the War itself. He will also discuss the recent Jutland centenary, and the 'Jutland Studies' the engagement has spawned.

-  /u/Bernarditos main interests are the experiences and the use of colonial soldiers and minorities on the battlefield.

I will be answering questions with regards to this -- modern remembrance of grand strategy of the Western powers, of soldier experiences before during and after the war, and home front life. Along with this, the corollary of what was it actually like to make these decisions, why they did, were they 'correct', and how it 'really' was for soldiers and civilians in this conflict.

Whatever his views on King may be, Harold Bloom's reading of *Harry Potter* is indefensibly sloppy. Far from being forced to drown in the phrase "stretched his legs" while making one's way through *The Sorceror's Stone*, the wary reader will encounter the phrase exactly once. I know this because I've checked. </TEXT>
