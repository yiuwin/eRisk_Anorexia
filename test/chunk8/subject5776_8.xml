	<TEXT> Blade Runner.
 I love sci fi movies, especially ones set in a world like the one made in this film. Even though it is a really pretty film (even today), i just found the characters and plot lacking severely. All the philosphical stuff the film was pushing just didn't have any effect on me because i just didn't give a crap about any of the characters in it.

I'm supposed to be unsure whether killing this guy is the right thing to do, even though all we've seen him do is threaten and murder people? 

Also the "showdown" at the end just got a bit silly for me, what with the android guy randomly howling for some reason.

Also i didn't get the ending at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me all GTA games have suffered from the "why the hell am i doing missions for this guy?" thing to some extent. V was the worst offender of this for me, i mean you spend more than half the game working for these assholes for no real reason. Devin Weston just tells you to do stuff for him and all three protagonists meekly follow for...what? It's not like he ever pays you. I got so pissed off brecause in my mind Trevor would have shot him well before the end of the game, it felt so out of character for him to do some idiot's bidding, that it really jarred me.

Also, that entire minigun heist (which was goddamn amazing) was to pay for some helicopter for a shitty FIB mission, which i didn't even get to keep!

Also, Devin Weston and Steve Haines got so similar that i kept getting mixed up in my mind who was who
