	<TEXT> I think all 4 teams got much better through the draft.  2 teams have franchise QBs.  The other 2 have QBs that could easily grow into being it.  There's a lot of talent spread around the 4 teams due to high draft picks the past few years.  I think the afc south will be among the best divisions in football the next few years  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Navy Seals come equipped with nothing except typical combat uniform, and whatever they can find or build at Home Depot.  They are not allowed to leave the fenced off garden or inside area of the store.  

The Vikings have typical armor and weapons of their era.  

The Navy Seals have 24 hours to prep inside the Home Depot before the Vikings attack from their camp in the parking lot.  It will not be a siege, the Vikings will attack when the 24 hour clock ends.  The HD is totally empty of anybody except the navy Seals.  For this the Forklift and other pieces of lift equipment can not be used  </TEXT>
