	<TEXT> Hey Vince, firstly I just want to thank you for Breaking Bad. I binged watched it while I was fighting my own drug demons (2 years clean now) and I've never related to a show so much. I'm a big fan of Better Call Saul too which relates to my question.

Both BB and BCS are stories of transformation, do you think Jimmy McGill is a more interesting character then Saul Goodman?

	<TEXT> Firstly, kudos to you for asking. Whether or not you are, it's important that you have noticed before acting upon it. If only more people done that this world would be a better place.

You have to remember that you're only 16 and your hormones will be bouncing all over, so it could always be a phase. The main question is do you find children sexually attractive? If yes then I would suggest that you seek help, primarily through a therapist. I'm not aware of any cure, but therapy would be a big help towards controlling your feelings or urges and *ideally* prevent you from acting on your desires.

If you don't find them sexually attractive, then I guess it's nothing to worry about.
