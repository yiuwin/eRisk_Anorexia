	<TEXT> It makes perfect sense, actually. I wrote it that way on purpose. I'm not saying "it does look" or it "looks like" - that would be a definitive statement. By saying "doesn't not look" I'm saying while we know it wasn't a bomb, it's not totally unrealistic to think it could look like a bomb.

	<TEXT> Not really... my point is more the fact that the media has made up their mind about Brady being guilty so instead of saying "allegedly did" which would have been easy to do here, ESPN just used "did" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is great news. Adopt don't shop is a rule that every American should follow. There are plenty of "status" dogs in shelters too. People "owner surrender" dogs they bought from a breeder or store as well. Shelters aren't all pitbulls and "scary" dogs. Sometimes people lose their job or someone dies or they want a new puppy instead of their "old" dog (yes I've seen this many times) and the dog who was once a designer, purebread or store bought dog now becomes a shelter dog. People need to realize that not all shelter dogs are "broken" or "scary" or "there for a reason" </TEXT>
