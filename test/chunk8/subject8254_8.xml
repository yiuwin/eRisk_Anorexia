	<TEXT> An explorer goes into an undiscovered tomb for the first time, and in the center of the tomb theres a lamp. He picks it up, and as he starts to rub the dirt off of it, a genie comes out of the lamp and says, I want to know the person you hate the most. The explorer says, Thats gotta be my ex-wife. Why? I am a cursed genie. I will grant you three wishes, but whatever you wish for, your ex-wife will get double that amount. Okay, I wish for a billion dollars. Granted, but you ex-wife gets two billion dollars. I wish for a mansion in California with a swimming pool, and tennis courts, everything. Granted, and your ex-wife gets two." "Now make your final wish. The explorer walks around for a few minutes, returns to the genie with a stick, and says, You see this stick? Id like you to beat me half to death. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ralph is driving home one evening, when he suddenly realizes that it's his daughter's birthday and he hasn't bought her a present. He drives to the mall, runs to the toy store, and says to the shop assistant, "How much is that Barbie in the window?" In a condescending manner, she says, "Which Barbie?" She continues, "We have Barbie Goes to the Gym for $19.95, Barbie Goes to the Ball for $19.95, Barbie Goes Shopping for $19.95, Barbie Goes to the Beach for $19.95, Barbie Goes Nightclubbing for $19.95, and Divorced Barbie for $265.00." Ralph asks, "Why is the Divorced Barbie $265.00 when all the others are only $19.95?" "That's obvious," the saleslady says. "Divorced Barbie comes with Ken's house, Ken's car, Ken's boat, Ken's furniture..." </TEXT>
