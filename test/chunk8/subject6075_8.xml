	<TEXT> Oh my gosh I had one of the worst experiences with that. It happened a lot because I'm small and black out easily. Waking up in the hospital was the worst place for me though. Glad I grew outta that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you talk about yourself like that you will start to believe it. Don't compare yourself to others, you are a completely different person and have skills and positive attributes that you probably don't notice or develop because you focus on the negative. I can't express how much perception has to do with happiness and depression. Look at your life through the eyes of a friend or a fellow redditer, keep an open mind to what they say about you. You reached out, that's the first step. I was depressed from the time I was 11 to 23. I'm better now because a close friend pointed out that I have a negative perception on life. Force yourself to see the positive. Listen to happy music and find a release. Music, art and a close friend can make a cosmic deference if you give in and try. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only a 92, that's an awesome score, you can probably get any job you want in the military! I think it's a good option for you at your present state. You will have money to finish college and travel, have a steady paycheck, and as a veteran, (I am 24
Female served in the Coast Guard) I know it's a hard choice to make. Also your military buddies will become a 2nd family to you! boot camp is not so bad and after that is pretty exciting. Think about it </TEXT>
