	<TITLE> Christine Collins and the Walter Collins Case </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I am just curious but in Los Angeles in 1928, and anytime after that year, were there any further discoveries regarding the possible murder and abduction of 9-year of Walter Collins? Also, I know Christine Collins died in the 1980's, I believe, in Oakland, but whatever happened to Arthur Hutchins, the 12-year old boy who was Walter Collins' imposter? Did he ever grow up to shed more light on the LAPD corruption, coercion, and gross mishandling of the case of missing Walter Collins?  </TEXT>
