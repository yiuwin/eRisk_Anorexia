	<TEXT> Get down to earth buddy, thats flaming

At this point, I'm not gonna bother disputing it any further so call it whatever you deem fit. I know what I did and I don't need your validation.

How about trying to win instead of tilting your team further

I'm doing both. I tilt the burden while I attempt to salvage the situation with the remaining decent teammates. By the time I start roasting someone, it would only be after he's proven himself to be of utter uselessness as a player. I'd treat him as nonexistent, gameplay wise, and treat the game as a 4v5. He would remain part of the team as an intangible entity for the team's amusement as the butt of jokes. That way, he would at least be contributing, technically. If we end up lose after all, it's not like we should have any real hopes of winning a 4v5 anyway.

And why would anyone "not survive" your "roasting"

Indeed, my root comment was meant to be taken as a hyperbolic humorous remark. I didn't expect everyone here to interpret it as me bragging about flaming pubs indiscriminately. I guess assuming a stranger is a retard is prioritized over giving them the benefit of doubt.

Those that I get unhappy about are the clueless ones that don't speak a single word at all as if they just started getting into dota. I don't expect them to play like a 5k and carry me, I just expect them to show some form of cooperation and desire to win. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the second time: there's a difference between roasting and flaming. If you insist on using the word "flaming" to describe what I did, suit yourself, the facts aren't changed.

Flaming doesn't do any good, and I didn't do it. Not to say that roasting someone instead is a positive experience for everyone involved but let's be honest, do you never get frustrated by someone not even bothering to cooperate in a team activity? I'm not just talking about dota, it can apply to any relevant scenario in life. And so I vented my frustrations - yes, I'm not exactly proud of it but it is what I do. If you're just gonna take a politically correct stance on the matter then truthfully I can only accept being made the bad guy. Though, you can count on being remembered as one Mr Condescending. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  unknown 8k player

No shit, nobody would know that he's actually an 8k guy playing on a smurf in the first place, of course there wouldn't be any talk. If I knew an opponent I just lost to is actually a few thousand MMR above mine using a smurf I'd be unhappy too regardless of whether he's some famous player or a random high skilled dude. It's definitely not just because it's waga.

	<TEXT> That's an option that's unfortunately unavailable for me. All the friends I play with regularly are within 3-1k and it's generally a bad idea to play a serious, coordinated game with large MMR gaps within the party. If I have 4 other 4k or high 3K friends, I actually wouldn't mind taking every game seriously. I just have no luck getting to know such people for 3 years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While it is true that OP is being extremely biased with his title and that he shouldn't be blaming the loss on waga, it's still a valid point that waga is negatively affecting the ranked match environment at 5k (though I wouldn't say "ruin"). 

Ranked matchmaking is made and meant to be a serious, competitive environment regardless of whether players view it as such. As long as a player is not taking a ranked match seriously i.e. "im just having fun LUL", he is making the game unfair for his teammates. The fact that he is way better than all 9 other players in the game or that he could easily win if he took the game seriously is irrelevant.

Which brings me to my second point: if he takes the game seriously, it obviously makes it unfair for the opponent team. So either way, he's making the game unfair to other players as long as he's playing ranked on a smurf. If he just wants to have fun, what reason is there for him not to queue unranked with his main? For fear that other players "ruin" his games by going "troll" builds? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is true and that is a problem. Giving out at least one Easter egg to each kid at the end is a simple yet effective solution, unless you have a way to make parents better at organizing Easter egg hunts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For real though, installing the various PC parts into a case and having it work isn't difficult, especially when you're just doing it for yourself. Watch a video or read an article together with looking through the manuals of your parts and you're honestly ready.

I didn't say it was hard - but you pay yourself nothing? Fuck I've got some jobs for you, come work for me. Each one will only take an hour at most, promise. 

Which is why there's no such job as "PC parts installer" for the reason explained above. Heck, at the shop where I bought my PC parts, the salesmen would actually build the PC for you if you bought all the parts from them for no additional cost. That's how much effort and knowledge it takes.

	<TEXT> There are good arguments for both sides to the issue so I don't have any problem with anyone on either side. Personally, I take the side of not leaving kids disappointed because, as said in many of the comments, they're just kids; they have plenty of time to fail and learn from it before it matters. Besides, an Easter egg hunt is supposed to be an enjoyable experience for the kids over being a competition.  

What's mildly infuriating is the post in response that's basically a cry for attention. "Hey, look, this is why I think he's wrong, upvote me!!!" </TEXT>

LPT: If you disagree with another LPT, it's just your fucking opinion. Don't make a whole new passive aggressive post about it. At most, comment in that thread about your disagreement. This is such a low cry for attention. </TEXT>
