	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Stuff like:

* Would you rather know when you're gonna die or how?

* If you could pause time once, what would you do while time is frozen?

* What superpower would be the most useful?

I know of subs like /r/wouldyourather, but I'm looking for one filled with questions like the ones above.

If it contains NSFW questions that's even better.

Example of NSFW question:

If your mom and girlfriend switched bodies and you have to fuck one of them for things to get back to normal, who would you choose?

Things that would get downvoted in /r/askreddit basically lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To get current gold players, you can either:

* buy a gold pack if you're looking for any gold player

* buy a team pack if you're looking for someone specific, like OKC pack for KD (still have to be lucky though)

* get 3 stars against a team in domination and hope that the 3 star pack gives you a gold player. It'll always give you at least a silver one though.

To get historic gold players, you will have to purchase the historic packs. To get MJ, buy the historic pack series 1, and just hope you get lucky. MJ isn't a collection reward so it'll be less of a grind.

Edit: Also there are some tournaments you can play to get some good players. You can get ruby Harden if you have 8 Rockets players on your team. Or you can go for ruby Curry if there's no PG on your squad. Finally there's a ruby Scottie Pippen tournament. That one's online only though, so be prepared. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a 6' athletic PG drafted #8 by the Pistons.

My sig skills are:
Posterizer
Highlight film
Shot creator
Pick pocket
Lebron coast to coast
Pick  amp; roll maestro
Alley ooper

I'm a pretty decent player but I play on rookie casual just for the hell of it haha, just because it's easier to get around people and it seems you posterize more often. Also I don't even need finisher or deadeye since every shot is A+. It's fun for me. Also you can literally reach in and get a steal at least every other possession.

I finished my first season and we won the championship. Haven't played with that file since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Little backstory. When I was 16-17 (2 years ago) I fell into a deep depression because I got rejected by my best friend, girl I liked so much I imagine it was scary.

I used to only listen to pop songs like Lady Gaga, Maroon 5, Pitbull, etc. A friend made me listen to Swimming Pools by Kdot, fell in love with it.

I've only listened to rap ever since. My whole library is 90% rap. I liked it because the tone is almost always aggressive, assertive and whatnot. It's how I got over her. It just happened instantly, after like a year of sadness.

Picked up on Kanye eventually. I thought MBDTF was my favourite album ever.

And then he released Yeezus... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're not the type to go out clubbing, get drinks and whatnot. They prefer movie nights, video game nights, board games, etc. This doesn't really bother me because I have a good time with them. I like them.

Yesterday, we went to the movies. After the movie, we were chilling in my car and one of them said we should do something tomorrow night (tonight).

I asked them collectively: "You guys wanna go to XYZ?"

"What's that?"

"It's a really nice club, makes for a good time."

Then one of them gave me sort of a dirty look and replied sarcastically. One of them said they'll text me the next day saying if they're down or not, which basically means "I don't wanna blow you off now, so I'll say no tomorrow."

I have other friends I could go with, that's not the issue.

All he retweets are fans who send him pics of their lineup or their collection reward. Either that or he answers those meaningless tweets insulting him; doesn't even acknowledge the ones who write a polite message.

His face is even more annoying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She never eats when we're supposed to. Say we're having dinner at 6. She doesn't eat at 6. She'll get a bit hungry at 8, with such small portions.

We also found out she's been sticking her finger down her throat to puke intentionally for the past year. At the beginning, it was 4 times a week. For the past 6 months, she says twice a week.

She's stopped for the past week though. I'm still very worried, she's only 17. I don't know what information to provide. If you want any, tell me. I'll be here all day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not talking about simulating seasons to get easy VC. I've seen people have teams where everyone is 90+ overall. How can I achieve that? Tank in the first season and trade everyone away for 1st round picks?

Also, what roster and draft class should I use to get the most fun? I'm on Xbox One. </TEXT>
