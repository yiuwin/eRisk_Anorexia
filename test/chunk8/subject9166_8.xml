	<TEXT> Reminds me of that one little scene in Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest where a trader is like "I trade spices there for delicious long pork, mmm" and later when Jack is escaping from the cannibal island we see the aforementioned spices there, and the connection becomes clear. Took me a while to get that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Limitless. I went in so skeptical with yet another movie to TV thing, especially a movie not even that popular. But you know what, it was refreshing, funny and engaging. Fit in very well with the original movie, too. 

For the life of me I can't figure out how it didn't get enough viewers.  </TEXT>

I have never seen Indians rejoicing like this at terror attacks in Pakistan. Yet Pakistanis call them "freedom fighters" fighting for their right. Even if they are Kashmiri, how can you say you care for them when you laud them when they pick arms and march to their death in a made-up cause? </TEXT>

Man when that train's crossing you just want her to be there, just so the guy can finally get some closure but no. At least in the manga continuation Kanae gets to Tokyo and finds him, and presumably they have something good. 
The second act with her is my favourite part, a large part of it is because it's just so god. Damn. Beautiful! Kanae's story is something I relate to more than Tohno though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spider-Man 2's in-credits sequence is in my opinion the most iconic first taste of any superhero movie ever. Right from the Colombia logo that amazing orchestral theme starts to pick up and man it gives me goosebumps every time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hear, hear! This, along with Secrets of the Castle are probably two of my favourite movie soundtracks from any movie. The Prisoner of Azkaban soundtrack just feels magical and it's a huge reason for the overall feel of the film itself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, I want in on that free until Dec 31 4G and to be honest I really need a stable quick connection. Don't have any 4G handsets in our house so I thought the MyFi hotspot device seems perfect. 

Anyone here already using it? Are there any hidden caveats? I saw one guy in the comments of a news site raging about how it was limited to just TWO gigabytes, but I don't want to believe him because he was a commentor on a news article. Any info? </TEXT>
