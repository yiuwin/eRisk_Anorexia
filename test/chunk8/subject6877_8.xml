	<TEXT> Hi there /r/picrequests   

I am looking for a banner in [this](http://i.imgur.com/EbWJF4l.png) kind of style with the main writing saying "Raw Rugby" instead of Torvesta. Please can this be in white. The small writing above please can it be "The Home of Rugby".  

Can the Background main colour please be black and maybe have a white/grey kind of smoke effect similar to the one in the picture above. If not I'm happy with just a black background.  

[Here is the main logo for interest.](http://i.imgur.com/6v50rkT.png)  

Thanks in advance!

	<TEXT> Yeah, I can't really blame the guy. I used my other channel and commented if I could use the video and then started making it on my other. I assumed in my head that I had commented it on the Rugby Rules channel and wondered why he hadn't replied with a notification so I stupidly just went ahead and uploaded it. He did reply the day before saying if I could please not use it but I obviously hadn't seen it so I'm completely in the wrong. Just a shame because it means all the traction I gained on all my videos will now be halted if I ever get the channel back. To be honest though getting it back will be a miracle. It's more YouTube and their stupid automated system that gets me. There complete lack of customer support means getting these sorts of things resolved is a nightmare. </TEXT>

Don't know if I could go through to pain of spending 10 hours making a video for it only to get 50 views. I need a basic kind of core viewer. I think for now my main focus will be on trying to get this guy to retract his strike and see if I can get the channel back somehow, no matter how unlikely! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why I think the All Blacks are going to convincingly beat the Lions this Summer. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-30 03:15:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's going to be a long one and it's all my own opinion so as always, feel free to savage me for my comments. I know I previously picked a Lions team 'to beat NZ' however I don't realistically think they can win.

I simply can not see them losing this tour and I can very much see them running away with this series in spectacular fashion.  

**Point 1.** Win Record   

The last time that the All Blacks lost 2 out of 3 games in a row was in 2008 when they lost to the [Boks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-9M74DAiWw), who were arguably the greatest South African team they had for over a decade. To find another time they have lost 2 out of 3 games in a row you have to go all the way back to 2000 when they lost the AUS, SA, and then France in the Autumn.  

The key reason for this is because the All Blacks are brilliant at learning from their defeats. All we have to do is look back to last Autumn when they lost to Ireland in Chicago people were billing Ireland to get a close win in Dublin. [The second test saw a brilliant New Zealand team bounce back from this defeat with a 9-21 victory.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdgQvV_Y2A) Read's message to his team of ['Don't Forget This Feeling"]( http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/all-blacks/86172309/aaron-cruden-reveals-all-black-captain-kieran-reads-message-to-team-after-shock-loss-to-ireland-in-chicago) really resonates with me personally as I feel this New Zealand team will have learned so much from that loss to Ireland.  

**Point 2.**  Home Record + Eden Park Effect.  

The home record that New Zealand has is outstanding. Yet again, to find the last time a New Zealand team lost at home was in 2009 against the Springboks. Similarly if you consider the last time they lost at Eden Park, this was in 1994. A 23-20 defeat to France. Additionally if you look at the last time the [the lions played New Zealand at Eden Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeiV84AXChs), then you can see it was a pretty convincing win. The Lions will have to aim to win the second test at Westpac stadium and then pray to play out of their skins in the first or third test. I simply can't see a team that has been together for just over a month beating a side holding a twenty three year record, no matter how much talent that team has.   

**Point 3.** The Forwards  
A theory of New Zealand beating the Lions purely on history would not be fair. However I believe the strength that New Zealand has in the forwards over the Lions will be a decisive factor in a strong New Zealand Victory. My first question the sub would be this. Could you see any of the Lions players being a 100% starter for New Zealand apart from maybe openside flanker?  

You have **Dane Coles** who has arguably completely reformed the aspirations of what it is to be a hooker in modern day rugby. Technically efficient, fast and [brilliant hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ceZdDS5SSs) make him a player who outshines the majority of the northern hemisphere hookers. The only similar player you have to him would be Jamie George and despite the fact that he has good feet, Coles has a whole new level of handling skill compared to him.  

**Joe Moody** and **Owen Franks** both yet again are proven winners with a combined 114 caps. Add that with [**Charlie Faumuina**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJto7NvZV6c) with his diversity and sheer size and you have a potent mix of skill power and most importantly experience. Faumuina will also be able to deal with the physical challenge that a possible player like Tadh Furlong may bring.  

**Whitelock** and **Retallik** are two fantastic players to have when you consider that the second rows for the Lions this year are the best they have probably ever been. The All Blacks are blessed to have the consummate workhorse that is Retallick against the likes of [possibly Itoje](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_uwXF-ljUs) in the Summer. This was the one place where people could arguably see the Lions challenging however with these two players here I can't really see that.  

Now we get to the back row which really personally excites me. People have been arguing that **Kieran Read** has not been the same as he was a few years ago however he still is without a doubt one of the top 5 8's in the world if not the best. Him not being the captain for the Crusaders as well has given him time to focus on his game and I feel this tour will really bring the best out of him. [This video is now a few years old however if he can even show half of the skill on display in this edit in the summer then he will be a real threat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b7fTDBFn4) **Jerome Kaino** brings such a [physical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fyHPuznsKU) element to the All Blacks. He will be pivotal in shutting down the likes of Vunipola and Stander (if picked). **Sam Cane** has the opportunity to really out to the *filthy casuals* that still possibly rightly see him as the understudy of Richie Mcaw and [**Ardie Savea**](https://youtu.be/8IqurBd48-s?t=2m29s) likewise has the chance now to assert himself as the starting 7 for the All Blacks with his agression and blistering pace.  

I believe that the 2005 Lions tour really highlighted the backs talent for the All Blacks with Carter, Umaga, Sivivatu and Gear running the show. However I believe this tour will be a showcase of the strength of the forwards for the All Blacks.  

**Point 4** The Barrett Effect.    

  [Everybody] 
 (https://www.facebook.com/Beaudenism/?fref=ts) knows just how damn good Beauden is. But let's just remind ourselves...  
1. [May The God's](https://youtu.be/RQ5R-0l7wdY?t=3m4s)  
2. [Have Mercy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDAWlsblxNE)  
3. [On Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK3nJ-uzBGo)  

Go clean yourself up... Anyway, we all know just how cool this kid is under the pressure and I really feel he will serve as a key bridge between the forwards and backs this summer. His only weakness is his placekicking but with everything else he brings to a team, I can without a doubt say that he will play a great role in New Zealand's win over the Lions. Add a possible [little brother](https://youtu.be/mfjVK8Nm-oA), who I think if picked will excel later on in the tour and you have the full package.  

I believe all these keys factors mean that the All Black's will win a 3-0 whitewash over the Lions. I think the 1st and 3rd test will be runaway wins and the 2nd Test as Westpac will be a close affair. I'm so confident in this that I am going to be betting a LARGE amount of money on a three nil win which is currently at 1.91.  

If you have read this far then I hope you enjoyed and don't disagree too much.  

TL;DR: All Blacks will win due to home record, power in forwards and beautiful Beauden. </TEXT>
