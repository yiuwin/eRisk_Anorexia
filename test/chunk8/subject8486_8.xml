	<TEXT> Note that for most religious groups, the plain text of the Bible is only one of the important things.  There are hundreds of years of interpretation that help you understand the legal, philosophical, moral, and symbolic dimensions of the text.

The exception would be fundamentalist Protestants, who claim that the text means exactly what it says. (Although I would argue that they hold no such viewpoint, as they pay exact attention to what the text plainly says about homosexuality, for instance, but pay no attention at all to what the text plainly says about eating pork).

tl;dr: you can read the Bible yourself but you're better off with some commentary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a separate problem if the charter schools don't have enough money.  They still take money away from the public schools.

But it makes me think: if the amount of money being spent per pupil at a public school isn't enough at a charter school, maybe the amount of money really isn't enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some good background from the Globe: http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/05/07/advocates-press-for-abolishing-state-cap-number-charter-schools/ybDWF7AuhMKJd2jjXVu7jK/story.html

One of the main reasons IMHO for some studies showing that charter schools (and private schools, too) having better outcomes than public schools is that the charter schools don't have to educate students learning English or students with disabilities.  And the most dysfunctional students in the public schools don't have parents who are going to apply to the charter schools.  That has the effect of leaving the public schools with the harder-to-educate students AND less money to spend on educating them. </TEXT>
