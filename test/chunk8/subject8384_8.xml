	<TEXT> Hey there!

I just found out there even is a thing called mechanical keyboards, have been using a 20 dollar logitech keyboard for 10 years now which i am surprised still works but while informing myself about a new keyboard I found about this whole mechanical keyboard product group.

While I was looking up information I saw that most of the great minimalistic looking mechanical keyboards dont have a numpad - why ist that? Is there a reason for that? Are they sold seperatly? Its a shame because I really want a white mechanical keyboard but with a numpad. Any ideas?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In Dr. Kens Season 2 finale titled Kens Big Audition, Brie will guest star as herself, an actress just cast as a series regular on Harmons new sitcom. Alison reads with Ken (Jeong) during his audition, and is soon uncomfortable with Kens bold acting choices. As previously announced,** Harmon plays himself, the creator of a new TV comedy set at a community college.**

 In the Microneedling group, patients received a **weekly** Microneedling procedure on the scalp with 1 ml of 5% Minoxidil lotion applied twice daily.

I try to dermaroll every 8 days because if you do it every week forever your head / scalp wont have enough time to heal and regenerate </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me too, I actually got the subscription exactly one year ago and took only two pills and then started imagining how my heart is racing and I couldnt concentrate anymore so I stopped after reading all those horror stories about taking fin (I didnt even look or saw positive fin stories) but after reading how many people are taking it for over 10 years or longer I started again over a month ago. I feel so much better because I know im doing everything I can against hair loss and the DHT itch is almost gone now which feels so good man even thoug I am shedding-phase right now </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there, I bought a dermaroller (1,0mm) and I apply it once a week. Do I have to disinffect my head with something? Cause I only sterilize the dermaroller and then roll over my head like 10 times in different directions.

I want to apply minox right after instead of some oils. Does anybody do that? </TEXT>
