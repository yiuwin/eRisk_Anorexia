	<TEXT> Oh man, I feel you big time in this. I did IP and PHP and while that was necessary for medical stabilization, the way it really helped me was ERP type shit. Forcing me to be scared and deal with it. But at the same time, it was isolating because most of the people around me had the pro ana thin stuff going on. But my problem was absolutely paralyzingly fear stemming from OCD and an inability to make a decision. I'm super lucky in that my outpatient therapist specializes in both anorexia and OCD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a pharmacy pathology research assistant (so like antibiotics and such).  It's amazing. Mayo is so legit to work for and if you are remotely interested in this kind of thing, I highly recommend you apply. The insurance is amazing, it pays well for a starting job, and they help out with your advanced education fees after you are employed for a year. Rochester may not be the most exciting place in the world, but the bar scene is full of interesting young medical field workers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to bring it up again with my therapist the next time I see her. I was never physically or sexually abused, but there's been some verbal in there with my dad (diagnosed narcissist) so depending on how that shit primes one's brain for PTSD from anorexia, it's possible. Obviously, the plural of anecdote is not data, but what you said about your friend is really interestingly relevant. Hmm.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm doing so so so much better than I was even a few months ago. And, while I still have work to do, I'm really proud of myself. That being said, I keep having horrible flashbacks to the sadness, emptiness, and physical pain of my Ed. I took my ability to tolerate that as a sign that I was a strong person back when I was in the depths, but just how damn close I was to dying of anorexia is really starting to sink in. The painful cold randomly comes to mind as well as the anxiety ridden doctors appointments where they told me about my heart issues and I panicked about potentially having to go IP. And the guilt I felt when sitting and running despite the risk to my heart. It all makes me sick and terrified to think about. My best friend was scared of/ for me and stopped returning my texts. 

I finally have a full time job and social life. I eat and exercise almost normally so I'm not sure why all these memories decided to start flooding back now. I think I just needed to emote; sorry for the rant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same here. Not quite as long of a commute but I have to drive, park, and bus in to the city so probably 80mins round trip. 

I have found the pre work workout to be a godsend. I get it over with in the morning and feel energized and accomplish start my day. The exercise makes it easier for me to focus on my work coupled with a nice cup of coffee. 

For food, the meal prep is for sure key. I like one pot things- chili and such. I can freeze it for dinners when I'm too tired to cook or bring to work for lunch. I work in a hospital, so I'm lucky in that if I forget a lunch, the staff cafeteria has really healthy options but I try to prep up chicken breasts and grab a bag of salad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is definitely not your fault. I'm sorry your OCD thoughts are beating you up so much. :(. I know there's no one cure all, but DBT skills have been so helpful for me. I have a lot of issues with intrusive thoughts and have found DBT helpful for this with the focus on redirecting your thoughts, mindfulness, and erp with some of the nasty thoughts. It was created for BPD, but don't let that fool you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really interesting theory about the progesterone refractory period type thing. Based on my understanding, you're along the right lines. In basic terms, estrogen is a stimulating hormone to the brain while progesterone is calming. Too much estrogen and too little progesterone, and you are irritable and have trouble sleeping. So maybe the progesterone is too high before and then it drops before the estrogen is being regulated to drop and that's why your extremes are so variable?  You could try doing saliva hormone tests on certain days and compare them.  For science.  </TEXT>

I walked everywhere- even places the bus was faster and when the weather was cold. I did homework standing up and browsed the Internet on my iPad wandering around the house. Sometimes, I would "forget" things places to give me an excuse for more movement, to hide the compulsiveness. You're certainly not alone; I understand how physically and mentally exhausting it is.  </TEXT>
