	<TEXT> The sad part is, all the idiots on council seem to think is we'll throw a subway in, but not for the right reasons.
I have no problem spending the money, but it could be done so much better.  Tory would have gained a helluva lot of traction if he'd said, he'd look at the subway plan, and then tossed it out for the 1. cost, 2. stupidity, 3. fact that a better plan was fully funded and ready.

We're gonna pay for this shitshow for years. </TEXT>

Queen to Eglinton is what I am hearing.  That's a helluva long time to be underground without any light.

Honestly.  It's nice to have articles written about this.
If this article helps ONE person from dealing with crack house apartments, slumlords, or cockroaches or god forbid bed bugs, then it will have done it's job.

The fact that so many in this thread are attacking the author without remembering what they were like when THEY were young is utterly typical r/toronto. </TEXT>
