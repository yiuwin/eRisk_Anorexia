	<TITLE> [advice] rent apartment vs buy house </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So Im living with my sister in the DFW (dallas, fort worth) area. lease is over in about 4 months and my sister is talking about buying a house. Im currently a college student and my sister is older, out of college, with an OTA(therapist job). Ive encourage her to look out housing thinking it might be cheaper, but then I've read things to think otherwise. Id say She has enough to make like a 3-7% downpayment on a house around 100k or little more. (and its would be her first time buying). my concern is it would end up costing more to maintain then just renting a apartment. another concern is she doesn't know yet if she could stay here for 3+ years, but after I'm done with school and have a good job Id like to stay here and could afford to stay even is she left. anyways to me it seems safer to continue renting. am I right/wrong? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bootcamp on mac or budget laptop </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Should I buy a budget laptop and put linux/windows on it? or i could change my 2012 mac pro cd drive to a hard drive and put bootcamp on it. Im thinking the benefit of having a cheaper laptop would be less fear of breaking it, or having it stolen. But benefit of having it on mac would be having everything in one and more power.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My parents cut cable when I was a kid. 13 year later and I would never pay for it or watch it. I prefer Hulu, Netflix, etc. I don't understand the people who leave their tv on all the time, but I guess it's how you grow up and it could be hard to break the habit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alcohol. Grew up in family that was against drinking any form of alcohol. 24 and out of the parents house. I drink several beers a week and don't see the whole fuss. Just don't drink and drive. I hate getting drunk tho. 
Edit:for those who have quit drinking because of addictions/etc. I congratulate you.  I understand Alcohol addiction is serious and for some living without is the best solution. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> this College right for me? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Im currently in Texas(DFW), but not a resident(from Florida).I might move again in the next 4 months. Im interested in online because of the flexibility. It would be nice for my classes to be uninterrupted if I relocate, possibly to a place with less college options. Does this work the same for out of state? also is it worth it If i think Im probably not going to have time to do full-time? Im interested in the software development BS degree. I have very limited knowledge from online learning on web development and want to pursue a career in development. Are the classes up to you to finish or are there semester/due dates/etc. i have credits from 2 different colleges which ill hope to transfer. one last question, how hard is it to get accepted. my college GPA is a 2.7. bombed a semester after high school.

Edit: After researching some more I'm worried i may not reach the criterea because I lack an associates degree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ok so I have 3 things i need help with.
1. How to get columns closer together. I can't figure out how to get the media icons or the portfolio pages closer.
2. The page is not coded yet for smaller screens. Im going to have it so the example pages are col-xs-6. The problem though, is that the background only work full page so if you viewed it on a phone the background woundn't match there formatting. 
3. My page seems really laggy? </TEXT>
