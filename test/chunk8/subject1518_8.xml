	<TEXT> I have thought about doing this, let us know how it goes! I'd really like to have some higher calorie days without the guilt but I'd have to learn to stop obsessing over the daily totals and just obsess over the weekly average instead lol. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is really good, quick to cook, takes forever to eat, and fills me up. I change up the ingredients every once in a while for variety, but I always end up coming back to bacon, cheese and spinach. That combo of ingredients is just amazing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This! Someone recently posted a link to an [article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/29/anorexia-you-dont-just-grow-out-of-it) about how serotonin levels are affected by restricting, and how that in turn causes changes in depression/anxiety in the disordered eater, and it was such an "Ohhhhh" moment for me. 

A really good blurb from the article:
*The body synthesises serotonin from the amino acid tryptophan, which we get from food. Eat less and you get less tryptophan, and hence less serotonin. For people predisposed to anorexia, therefore, starvation reduces the anxiety and irritability associated with their high serotonin levels. The problem is that the brain fights back, increasing the number of receptors for serotonin. This increased sensitivity means that the old negative feelings return, which drives the person to cut back even more on what they are eating. Any attempts to return to normal eating patterns wind up flooding the hypersensitive brain with a surge of serotonin, creating panic, rage and emotional instability.*

	<TEXT> When I was a kid, I was neglected pretty regularly. My Mother, a narcissist, resented me and told me often how much of a burden I was. One of her favorite things to do was not feed me, or purposely feed me things I hated and then tell me I couldn't eat anything else until I finished what was in front of me. I was about six maybe, and I distinctly remember the steamed-all-to-mushy-hell broccoli with a big glob of MAYONNAISE on top of it. I wouldn't eat it. For three days and three nights she put that down for me to eat until she realized I was not going to. She sent me to my Grandmother's house because "she just couldn't look at me anymore."

My Grandmother's house was my one true safe place from my Mother's tirades for a while. She not only loved me, she let me have anything I wanted. I remember being so upset about the broccoli, but out of some sort of twisted loyalty to my Mother, I didn't tell her about it. Just that I was hungry. And so she pulled a package of cookies, a jar of peanut butter, and a glass of chocolate milk out for me. And I ate it. All of it. And that's when I discovered that food could be comfort. 

I went back and forth between hatred of my Mother/myself (starving) to depression (binging) but maintained a relatively normal bodyweight throughout my childhood, but switched to straight starvation in middle school. Went through massive bouts of depression in high school, which meant binging and then I discovered purging which went on for several years until I sought treatment as an adult. After being treated for the bulimia, I went into straight depression/comfort eating for several years until I just switched back to restricting because being overweight was just making me more depressed.

I've never had a normal relationship with food. 

Tl;dr: Have never been normal lol. Childhood is when my first ed behaviors started.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I almost never know I've done it til I wake up in the morning and see the wrappers or I've left stuff out. I ate ice cream one time and left the container out on the counter, for example. Otherwise I would've had no clue. 

It's a horrible feeling to wake up and realize you've done it. I am super careful about what food I keep in the house now so if it does happen again, I won't eat bad things. But still. The worry about "did I eat something, how much did I eat, how do I count these macros if I don't even know!?!?!" haunts me. I keep the fridge/freezer doors locked because I'm not very dexterous when unconscious, apparently, and I don't keep anything anywhere that can just be grabbed and snacked on. That has eased a lot of the anxiety this causes. Not restricting so extremely also helps almost completely eliminate it but fuck that lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a horrible sleepwalker/sleepeater. I no longer keep food in my house that doesn't require preparation because if I have an episode, I am usually too much of a clumsy fuck to actually assemble ingredients and cook shit in that state. *Usually*

I've noticed that these episodes come about a lot more frequently depending on what sleep medication I am currently on (some have a higher prevalence of sleepwalking/sleep eating as side effects), whether or not I have been getting adequate sleep (adequate for me is 4-5 hours a night) and how extreme I have been restricting. It seems if I've been going on too long without much sleep or food, my brain will kick in to autopilot mode when I'm asleep and try it's hardest to make me eat. Asshole brain. .

	<TEXT> I am making an effort to not restrict as severely as I have in the past, but it is hard. I'm not up to 800 calories a day yet, but I'm getting there. You're right, hunger does catch up to you and it's become such a pattern for me to restrict heavily for a few weeks and then go off the rails when my brain kicks into survival mode. I'll eat like a mad cow for three days or so and then spiral back down into "you deserve to suffer because you're a failure" mode, restricting myself to 500 or less until the mad cow stage takes over again. I'm tired of the cycle. 

So here's hoping that a more moderate restriction is successful. Good luck to you and congrats!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same. I can even go the motions in the same day. Like last weekend I hit my lowest weight in years and I was like "yessss I'm not a blob in these pants anymore." Then went to run errands, came home, walked by the same mirror and went "Omg, I went out in public in these pants? What the fuck? I can see every roll and ripple on me. Ewww."

	<TEXT> Okay, let me preface this by saying I know I'm irrational lol.

I'm attempting to eat a little more. Not because I am happy with myself, or because I am ready to give up my ED, but because I have been sick and had the energy of a sloth and well, I'm just tired of feeling like shit. I can't run anymore, my skin is gray, and I'm tired of binging after restricting too long. 

I have tried to figure out my BMR and TDEE and set a reasonable deficit from those and follow it, but I do that for about three days and then the hyper restriction sets in because idiot brain, I eat 400 calories a day for a couple of weeks and then the inevitable binge occurs and I end up right back at this same spot, telling myself to do it reasonably.

Problem is, I don't trust TDEE calculators to get it right. I have used about a dozen different calculators, and averaged the results for my TDEE of about 1500 using sedentary as my activity level because I'm afraid it will give me a number too high if I say I'm active. If I deduct 500 calories from my estimated TDEE, I feel like I need to deduct a little more *just in case* and then I still get too paranoid so I go back to 400-500 calories because it feels safe. 

I feel like if I eat 900-1000 calories a day, it's too much. It's not safe. I won't lose or worse, I will gain. Someone tell me I will lose still, that biologically speaking, even if I were the most sedentary slug on earth, I will not gain at 1000 calories a day. Please shut my stupid brain up. I know I am at a point now where weight loss will be slow regardless, and I'm fine with that but for the love of all that is holy, if I gain I will lose my mind. 

900-1,000 calories just seems like *so much*. (Didn't seem like so much when my fat face was eating that ice cream though, did it? Ugh.) </TEXT>

I have a maximum amount of calories I will allow myself per day (unless I screw it up and eat 12 days worth of food in one night because someone hurt my feelings but that's another story for another day) so say I allow myself 500 calories but I know I'm going to want to drink tonight. I'm not wasting any of those calories on food, I'm going to save them for vodka's sweet release.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. YES. So much yes. 

And I will go one step further and say that I have been having fights with my roommate lately over, not just food but....*food storage containers*. I am short, and he is tall, so the agreed cabinet arrangement was that the three cabinets on the bottom in the kitchen are mine, all the top ones are his. Lately, I've caught him using my containers to store his nasty food in and it makes me irate. I asked him politely several times to not use my things and he continues to. So, I bought him a 20 piece food storage set at Walmart this weekend and when I got home from work last night he was in the kitchen, making tuna salad, IN MY GODDAMN CONTAINERS. I snapped. I went on Amazon and ordered a cable lock like you use for bikes, so I can loop it through the cabinet handles and lock my stuff away. Pathetic. And I mean, it's not just the food and the containers, it's my dishes, my fucking Zum bar soap, my vitamins, anything...he's so inconsiderate. I wish I could afford to move and live alone right now. 

Whoa, sorry. That was way ranty-er than I intended lol. Guess I needed to get that out.  </TEXT>
