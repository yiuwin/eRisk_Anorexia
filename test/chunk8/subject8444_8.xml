	<TEXT> Basically it depends on what your goals are. I'm sure most will agree with me that unless you are aiming to top the DPS charts then any T5 or higher ship will suffice to play endgame content. If you go the T5 route I recommend one that can be upgraded.

P.S. Space Barbie is the real endgame (I know someone will say this anyways). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Compared to some of the other stories posted here this is nothing. I was living in Vegas at the time I had just gotten of work on my way home. The news had retorted a heat storm on the way. I stopped by the 7-11 by my house for some snacks. This guy (homeless I presume) asked if I could spare some change. I didn't have any change I could give, so I ask him what he was trying to get. He was honest and said that he was looking to get a beer. His honesty for some reason resonated with me, I told him to give me a moment I went in and got what I needed and picked up two tall boys of bud light (it was 2 for $3) and grabbed two sandwiches.

I gave it to him and wished him a dry weekend. He thanked me with a shocked look on his face. As I headed for my car I heard him say that it was the nicest thing someone had done for him.

I didn't even think it was a big deal (it was $8 at most), but I guess for some the smallest thing counts. I never saw the guy again but I hope he is doing well. But this event stuck with me, it reminds me that I am much better off than a lot of people out there. </TEXT>
