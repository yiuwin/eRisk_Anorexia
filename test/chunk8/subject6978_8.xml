	<TEXT> So yesterday I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa of the restrictive type. But my bmi is 19.4. I'm 108 lbs and 5" 2 so definitely not underweight. Is this diagnosis correct? I thought it was just EDNOS. And I eat a lot.. I'm not that restrictive I eat between 1200-1500 a day!!! So why this diagnosqis? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope you're doing better now. It took a lot of strength to get help, and sometimes I wish I hadn't done it.... Because people worry about me way too much. But I know it was a good choice. Thanks for the encouragement </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Girls... I feel like I really need help. I'm 23, 5" 2 and 110 lbs. I lost 66 lbs. I have been strength training since September and I enjoy it a lot.  

For the past few months I've been battling the early stages of an eating disorder. I have some good days, and some are bad, and I have so much anxiety I can't sleep. Some days I want to get serious about lifting because I enjoy it so much. But I'm so scared of gaining more muscle than what I already have.
Some days, I understand that I won't get bulky overnight, and I decide to work out and eat a good 1500 calories. But most days I force myself to get to those 1500, because I know I shouldn't be at a deficit anymore... And I'm doing damage to my body by eating less. My period has been gone for a few months now, and I'm having problems with my stomach as well. For this ED problem, I'm getting help and have an appointment set for July 21st in a clinic with a psychiatrist and a nutritionist.

So yesterday, a trainer gave me a new workout, to gain strength and get a bit more into lifting without being scared of lifting heavier. Before this, I did strong curves for the first 8 weeks and dropped it because "my thighs are too big". Didn't strength train for two weeks, and just got back into it. I missed it.

Here's the plan I got:

Workout A: (twice per week)
Squats 5*5
Barbell chest press 5*5
Hip thrust 3sets*8reps
Leg curls (machine) 3sets*12reps
Leg press (machine) 3sets*12reps
Incline dumbbell chest press 4sets*8reps
Cable pushdown 3sets*8reps
Tricep press 3sets*12reps

Workout B (twice per week)
Deadlift (conventional) 3sets*5reps
OHP 5*5
Front lat pulldown 5sets*8reps
Seated cable row 4sets*10 reps
Shoulder fly 3sets*12reps
Horizontal cable extension 3sets*12reps
Dumbbell bicep curls 4sets*8reps


I don't know if I would gain too much muscle from this kind of routine. Should I do it? What do you think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't do it. I would like to share my story.

I had a successful weight loss journey from 80 kg to 52 kg (176 to 115 lbs). Im 5" 2/159cm. I did not track my calories or my macros, just made it a point to have balanced meals, good amount of protein and lower carbs.
I honestly don't remember why, but I decided to start tracking my calories and my macros 2 months ago. And I feel like my life escalated down hill so quickly since then. I became obsessive to the point where by lunch, I'm already logging all my meals for the next day. I get happy when I eat under my BMR. I sit in restaurants and cry because I can't log the food in properly since I don't know things like measurements and exactly what they use. I ate a piece of cake on Friday for the first time in God knows how long, and the next day I didn't eat a single thing until 2pm and felt like crap. My weight dropped to 50 kg (110 lbs) and I'm having horrible issues with my stomach every day for around a month now. I know that I'm not on a very low weight (bmi 19.7) but this is all while strength training and gaining visible muscle.


So trust yourself. You know yourself. I knew if I would start tracking I'd become obsessive, and I was right. But now I can't stop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm like you, I'm actually half way through Bret Contreras's strong curves, and I'm considering dropping it because I have gained too much on my thighs and I just look fatter than when I started. Yes, my butt looks better... But I'm not sure its worth it. Beware. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my favorites is to chop up an apple, put it in a bowl, sprinkle some cinnamon and stick it in the oven for two minutes. It's very satisfying when you want something warm and sweet, and pretty low calorie. You can also put in some chia seeds, cranberries, honey, some yogurt on the top....  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently switched to a new gym and I'm still familiarizing myself with it. I was looking for the squat pad, since last time I hurt my neck and did NOT enjoy squatting without the pad. When I couldn't find it I asked the man who works in the reception since there wasn't a trainer around. He told me they don't have pads. And then he "kindly" showed me how to do squats with dumbbells and said: "you're a woman, you're not a man, you don't need to do heavy squats. Take a couple of 5kg dumbbells and do it like this" *proceeds to demonstrate"

Well FUCK YOU </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Girls who did strong curves- are there any specifications for stretching after the workouts?
Also, workout B calls for warm up with a stick or tiger tail, I don't have access to one. Is it OK to use a foam roller on the areas I'm supposed to use the stick? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I will look into that.. I saw a nutritionist a couple of weeks ago to talk about how to maintain my current weight but couldn't do what she recommended.. For example adding healthy fats. I've had peanut butter in my pantry for two weeks and today was the first time I had some. I look at it and my head screma CALORIES run now! So I guess I should see someone about it you're right  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me too! I went from 80kg to 50kg. At 159cm. Many people around me are worried about me getting too skinny, and even though I KNOW I weigh skinny, I still feel like a fluffy marshmallow. I feel like the scale thinks I'm skinny when I'm not... And I definitely feel like I should lose more weight when I look in the mirror. But according to the scale I shouldn't. I'm at a bmi of 19.8
It's getting kind of confusing honestly, and I don't know what to do. I feel ya... </TEXT>
