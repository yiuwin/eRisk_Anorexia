Here's their annual report. Look at the first couple pages in the pamphlet.

Union town, Alabama: they mention the town is 91% black

Baton Rogue, Louisiana: 

New and notorious police killings of black men, from Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge to Philando Castile in Minneapolis, have given momentum to the ACLUs longstanding work against police violence, especially in communities of color. Public outrage has sparked a renewed sense  of urgency, media attention.....

No mention of white men being killed by police. This is strictly for the very few number of black men in unjustified police shootings. 

"Anti xenophobia" is the next one.

Biloxi, Mississippi: mass incarceration of blacks. 

This is what they do. They virtue signal for money and have turned into this social justice warrior organization.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trumps said some dumb shit in his campaign, but I don't believe that he's actually a racist. He's met with leaders of black communities in Chicago and Detriot and he wants to make a difference in those types of cites. Muslim isn't a race it's a religion. For him to question the motives of a religion is completely fine and is done by the left and the right every day. It's ok for the left to constantly demonize Christianity, but Trump wants to vet travelers from known terrors countries that are primarily Muslim and that makes him a racist? Hardly.

Also there is plenty of racism from the Democratic Party, but for some reason it's not a problem when they do it. Look at Bill Clinton's dog whistle political agenda that gave the maximum sentences for drug criminals.  He pushed this through knowing very well that it would disproportionately affect inner city communities. That's real racism. There was a woman running for (DNC Chair? Can't remember the actual position) and she said something along the lines like "white people must be stopped and taken out of power" blatant racism ignored by the left. The new up and coming democrat Muslim who has defended and protected Louis Farrakhan's views on racism against whites on multiple occasions.

There is racism on the left, you either just don't want to see it or you don't realize it's there. </TEXT>

I'm fiscally conservative but socially more liberal. These things that you listed above are what drive me nuts about the R party. If they don't want abortion then why not fund the shit out of birth control? Makes no sense to me.

The right is fiscally conservative, classically liberal, anti-communism, and more Christian. None of that has to do with racism. 

You want racism? How about FDR putting Japs into internment camps? That's real racism. The left walks around all high and mighty like they are the ones who love diversity meanwhile they pay $10,000 a year for their kids to go to an all white preschool in the upper east side of Manhattan, then claim they aren't racist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You do realize that questioning a judges ability to proceed a case based on not only race, but the act that he was associated with an anti-white radical group is normal and it's done all the time in our legal system? You ever hear of them changing jurors to people of a different race because the composition didn't give them the best outcome to win the trial? They also do this with women and men. If the defendant is a younger kid they will put more women on the bench because they are more likely to acquit a younger kid then a middle aged guy. Is that sexist? 

Appointing someone to a position isn't racism. Steve Bannon was accused by an ex wife of being anti-Semitic. There's no evidence of this ever happening.

And the left wants to call us racist for voting Trump when they almost just had a radical anti-white Islamist almost win DNC chair who is a prominent member of the party? 

I'm not saying Trump may or may not have racist tendencies, but the reasons you give aren't completely valid. If he creates a policy that is racist than I will stand against him in solidarity with you, but until that happens why don't we relax with the rhetoric or at least get better reasons that he's racist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's estimates saying that it would cost $100bn per year, on the low end $70bn so yes after 10 years it's trillions. 

The department of education just put out a study showing that Obama's huge increase in the educational budget did literally nothing.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/local/education/obama-administration-spent-billions-to-fix-failing-schools-and-it-didnt-work/2017/01/19/6d24ac1a-de6d-11e6-ad42-f3375f271c9c_story.html?client=safari

This money was thrown at the education system and will never be recovered. Sure we can send everyone to college for free, but don't bitch and moan when a college degree means nothing and nobody can find a job in an over saturated market.

	<TEXT> But the military employs people, like a job.  The defense budget pays companies like Lockheed which employs engineers and other types of jobs. Giving people a free education to get a degree in gender studies is basically money thrown to the education system that will never be recovered. You can't seriously try and equate the defense budget which employs millions of people to giving everyone free liberal arts degrees which will do nothing to advance the country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How is it an investment? The value of a 4 year degree would continue to plummet with the supply drastically overshadowing the demand.  We still need plumbers and electricians. Also, colleges are bloated with useless degrees. Want a degree in gender studies? Sure, but you won't ever get hired.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Free college would have costed TRILLIONS. Not even the same order of magnitude in cost.

Edit: if you seriously think making higher education free to everyone in America will better our future then you should drop your gender studies course and take basic economics.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not only do they coincide, but there's been a drastically increasing number of autism diagnoses because of advances in science and being able to diagnose it better. All of this leads to some really strong correlation and anecdotal evidence (oh well there's increased diagnoses of autism so it must be related to the increased number of vaccinations!), but it's all false. The guy who originally wrote the paper linking vaccines to autism falsified some data and was blacklisted from publishing more papers about it. The other authors also retracted their names from the study.  If you take any virology or immunology class the professor will tell you it's all crap.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Further government spending on schools doesn't work as proven by the Obama administration. The Department of Education just came out with a study that the additional 7bn did literally nothing for schools and students.

Not saying Devos is a good or bad fit, but this notion that republicans are evil for not increasing school funding is getting old. </TEXT>
