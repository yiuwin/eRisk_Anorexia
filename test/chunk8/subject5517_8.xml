	<TEXT> If they don't plan on reproducing, I see nothing wrong with it. It would be weird though, because of societal standards and conditions. I wouldn't want to fuck my brother, just because that would be weird. 

That seems to be the only reason (aside from how potentially messed up the offspring would very likely be) - It would be weird. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope you're being sarcastic. Getting hard is a *physical* response. It doesn't mean consent. Some women get wet during rape. That doesn't mean consent either. It just means sexual contact is occurring and the body is reacting as it is biologically conditioned to do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of those things have nothing to do other patriarchy. Rape, abuse,  molestation murder, abusive parents are not tools of the patriarchy. It's just tools of bad people. And are you really *defending* some of those monsters just wh cause they are female? You can't say they don't know any better. Even f they were abused, that doesn't mean it's ok for them to do it to others. And they know that, it's just a bullshit excuse they use. All abusers use bullshit excuses. I was abused by my mother all through my childhood and sexually assaulted by a woman but that doesn't make me think it's ok to do that to others. I also accept that just because some women commit crimes like that doesn't mean all of them do, just like how because some men commit crimes like that doesn't mean all of them do. The reason some victims because abusers is not because of patriarchy, it's because they want to feel the power and strength they feel they lost when they were abused. That's why anyone abusers someone- to feel power and control.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In essence...

Both advocate and promote unhealthy bodies (Pro-Ana promotes super-skinny, malnourished bodies and eating too little, FA promotes super-sized bodies receiving poor nutrition and eating too much)

Both glorify eating disorders (Pro-Ana glorifies anorexia nervous and FA glorifies bing eating disorder)

They both treat deadly habits as lifestyle choices (Pro-Ana treats it like a hobby, a game, a status symbol, a club, a beauty routine, FA treats it like an identity, a cute quirk, and as a natural thing)

The only real difference is that society is quickly accepting Fat-Acceptance, HAES, etc, and demonizing Pro-Ana even though *both* should not be treated as what they are- movements that help each other destroy their bodies and pat each other on the back for it. </TEXT>

A doctor informing you you having a medical condition (being fat) and should follow the treatment (healthy eating, less eating, more exercise) and you being offended by it is not "triggering". Triggered is when you experience sensory information that reminds you of a traumatic experience that may cause intense emotional distress, flashbacks, and physical symptoms.

	<TEXT> That's not our sole purpose anymore. There are many many reasons why humans live life. Yes, we started out like any other animal; feed, reproduce, die, repeat...but now we live fuller lives and the complexity of our emotions our what change things. Rape is bad because of the emotional effects and the fact that humans no longer live only to reproduce. It's not just about survival anymore, it's about quality of life too. And rape messes with that. It is emotionally devastating.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was 13 I rarely left my house so I never saw things that were far away, but once school started after summer I realized I couldn't see the the trees in the distance as I was waking
home and the white boards had looked fuzzy all day, and I was squinting a lot. As it progressed, everything looked fuzzy. 

Eventually I got an appointment and I got some black, thick-rimmed glasses for my near-sightedness.  </TEXT>
