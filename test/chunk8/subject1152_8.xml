	<TEXT> Thanks for the advice; I really appreciate it.  I'm going to try to set up an appointment with a doctor/ diatician to get back to a healthy state.  I'm slowly coming to the realization that I started working out to get healthy and stay that way.  Even though I think I look good, doesn't mean I'm as healthy as I should be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is extremely helpful, thank you!!  It sounds like we have almost the exact same situation, because I too haven't been hungry though it's apparently not enough food.  That part was especially confusing for me because I figured if my body were truly starving, I would feel it. </TEXT>
