	<TITLE> I let you keep talking to the girls you cheated on me with because I trusted the shit out of you </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Your face was so red and flushed and wet that day you cried to me. You begged to be taken back, after you knew you were found out. You promised nothing like this would ever happen again. Not even a little bit. You cried and cried, so hard. I believed you. I hated to see you hurt. I believed you. I trusted for a bit more.


Now everythings reeks of a sickening de ja vu.


They were the girls from work. I knew you would have to continue interacting with them on a daily basis. I knew it would be ridiculous of me to ask you to just completely ignore them. But I did ask you to have more of a business relationship with them and not get mixed in with their personal drama. You agreed and pretended to be okay with it. 


I knew deep down you wouldn't be able to maintain just a professional relationship with them. The temptation was too big. And you are one of the few people I know who has extraordinarily low discipline and impulse control. You're a diabetic who chugs 2 liter bottles of soda for christ sake!


So I knew you still texted them. You still were on their social media. You still went through and liked the pictures they put up where they layed in bed, barely clothed, winking, as if to mock me and my love for you. 


And though I can't say with 100% certainty, I recognized that more than likely nothing had changed at work. The flirty behavior, the closeness, the touching. The intimacy in which you felt entitled to have with these girls, but were too weak to be honest about. The intimacy that I believed only we were allowed to share.


But anyways, today you accidentally sent me a text that was meant for one of them. I wasn't suprised. I wasn't suprised at the chosen topic of conversation.  I wasn't angry or upset. I wasn't suprised one bit. I knew it was still happening. I had accepted it as a part of being in a relationship with you. You were always going to be mangled up with these girls.


But then came the denial. The lies and deceit and dishonesty started pouring from your mouth. And that was the one thing that I had always told you I couldn't stand. 


Lies and liars.


 I knew you were a dishonest man for a while now. And I committed a dating sin. I tried to change you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hehe it's okay. I know there are many programs set in place for people in a jeopardized situation. I think I'll be okay on the money side of it, and I don't think I'll be at risk to be homeless or anything, but it's just the fear of my family and the look on my father's face if I should ever have to encounter them again.


 All of my "close friends" have slowly started parting ways with me. I think it's because I can't ever socialize with them outside of school or hang out with them or anything over the weekend. So I guess they've kind of given up on me. I don't blame them. They can be really supportive and I wish I was able to chill with them more. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Wanting to move out but scared shitless... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey guys! Hope all is well for you and finals aren't too terrible (for those of you taking them). 


I have a bit of a problem and was wondering if I could get some advice/input.  


So, like many of you, I really want to move out. Up until a few weeks ago, this would have been impossible for me. I barely made any income (~$2000 a year) and my parents wouldn't let me get a full time job or even work seasonally for fear of me having financial independence and leaving. 


Well recently, I got into an awesome scholarship program that will award me around $1,000/month for the next two years as well as pay for part of my tuition.


At first, I was glad to have this money to just use to pay off some of the debt of my student loans that I was forced to take out for the last two years. That was the expected and wise thing that everyone believes I will do. Even I will admit that this will make my life easier in the future. 


On the other hand, I feel as though my patience is drawing very thin, and I've realized that I really want to get away from this place (parents' house), as soon as humanely possible.


This place that is becoming more and more like a prison by the day. This place where I'm basically prohibited from doing everything, except work, school and cleaning. This place where I've learned to never even try to *ask* to hang out with my friends because the answer will always be no, or even worse, a no along side a slue of interrogating questions. This place where the only "fun" can be besides my mom or siblings, because no one else can be trusted and why would I even want to hang out with other people?!


This place where it is perfectly okay for my mother to have a tracking service on my phone, and when I get upset about it, told that "if you're doing nothing wrong, and where you should be, you have nothing to worry about".


This place where I'm not allowed to drive, where my mom checks every text message or phone call I make or that is made to me and drills me about it. This place where every morning I'm driven to school, my outfit is checked out by my mother to make sure it's appropriate, and now recently, my father, who was on the more liberal side has been making remarks on my clothes.

This place where if I stay a little later on campus to finish work, I am called every few minutes and yelled at/ drilled by my mother to make sure I am doing what I said I was doing. 


It feels like the longer I stay, the worse it gets. I look at my sister and how she's been reduced to a zombie who's too exhausted to fight back and is being accused of everything "haram" thing one can do. She's given up and now just goes to work and comes home awaiting a barrage of insults and accusations from my mother. 


Don't get me wrong, I certainly appreciate some of the things my parents have done. Specifically my father, for providing for me for so much for this long. 


But I feel as though I need to leave the nest. And finally, I have an opportunity to do so.I just can't stand it anymore. I'm losing the few friendships that I have because we can't interact outside of school. Every phone call, every text message, everywhere I go is monitored. Even if I'm a little late, because I had to stop by somewhere to use the restroom or get food before going home, I am interrogated. I just can't do it anymore. It is literally a prison dynamic. 

I feel as though I'm not even living. As fucked up as it sounds, I'm just waiting for my parents to die or leave me alone so I can breath some air. So I can just live. 


But I'm so afraid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, BPD is an extremely difficult mental disorder to attempt to treat. I even know some clinicians who refuse to try and treat people who are diagnosed with BPP, because it is such a complex and fragile disorder. 


That being said, it is certainly not an excuse for what has happened to you, how you were treated and how I assume other patients might have been treated. But it might give you some insight into why it was so difficult for most of the psychologist to pinpoint the issue or to have a conclusive plan to resolve it. 

As far as I know, the only treatment that has minute evidence to support assistance for individuals suffering with this disorder is dialectical behavioral therapy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the last part about how he lies about talking to other girls wasn't really mentioned in the other comments. But I'd like to point out that personally, that would bug the living crap out of me. What reason would he feel for lying about stuff like this? And then why would the 2am conversations not flow?


It could just be an innocent conversation, but from personal experience where I dealt with less than honest people, I would be very weary of these behaviors. 

Maybe your gut feeling is telling you something a little stronger than you realize?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, everyone is different. Just because it would have helped to motivate you to lose weight, doesn't mean she'll have the same reaction. 


This could potentially be the spark for her to get an ED. I certainly am not an advocate for unhealthy weight or believe that being overweight/obese is in any way a good thing. If you do want her to adopt better health habits, then you should put it to her in a more constructive way. Honestly though, if you're going to choose to leave  her either way, I don't think it's really in your place to even tell her that. Mentioning that probably would have been more helpful to her if you stuck with her and worked on it with her. There's nothing wrong with trying to improve the health of someone you care about (not just in an aesthetically pleasing sense). But just straight up telling her she's fat after you leave her will probably cause some issues. 


And everyone has a type. Whether that's fat or skinny or medium. You shouldn't feel bad about that. You probably shouldn't have slept with her if you knew deep down it wasn't going to go far and you were horny and she was just "available". Especially if she had in her mind that the relationship was going further.


But hopefully you have learned not to believe in the potential deception of the internet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know exactly how you feel. I wish I could be optimistic and tell you that not every man is like this. Logically, I know that it's true. But my personal experience has been the complete opposite.


 I'm so sorry that you're hurting. But it won't get better if you hide it. You looked through his diary because you felt suspicious about something. That absolutely does not make you as bad as him. You are nowhere near on his level of disloyalty and betrayal. You have to be strong. You have to push through this. You can't just sit and pretend it didn't happen. If you do, it will eat away at you. It will turn your heart dark, and your blood bitter and you will grow to hate the living crap out of him. Which is okay. You are justified in hating him at this point. But you need to get away from him. You don't want to turn into a resentful and bitter person for the rest of your life. Don't allow him to do that to you. You need to bring this up. Be strong. 


And if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here. I've been through this so many times, I know it almost like the back of my hand. It doesn't make it easier, but knowing someone has your back always helps. 


Good luck. </TEXT>

From my personal experience, it's good to trust to a certain point. But don't put too much trust into a person, cause if they don't end up being very trustworthy, you'll end up with the worst heartache ever. 


Especially if you've been badly hurt before. Be careful with your heart. It's an organ that takes a very long time to heal. 


Let this guys actions speak for himself. You'll know in the long run whether or not you can completely trust him after you've known each other for a while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I think it's important to understand that Islam and many, if not all religions, can be translated into a way of life. If you still can relate to many of the teachings and traditions, and they seem adaptable to you, then I see no reason to drop them all for the sake of taking on the title of "exmuslim".

In the end, it's your life, and you get to pick and choose what you feel comfortable following and kick to the curb what seems to be complete garbage.

I personally don't believe in simply hating and demonizing every part of Islam, because I believe that there are some good parts, just like with every religion, that can be learned from. I actually enjoy practicing and employing self discipline during Ramadan with fasting, while a lot of people might think that habit  is a load of bogus. 


At the same time, some parts seem to me to be barbaric and outdated, and so I've completely turned away from them. 


Being an exmuslim doesn't necessarily mean you have to shit on and hate every part of the religion. You can define for yourself what it means to you. I don't think it's as easy of a transition as one day being muslim, then bam, nonmuslim. 


I think there is a gray area that many of us are in, where we don't really consider ourselves muslims,even if we do some "islamic" things out of habit or comfort, but do not hate the religion and just want peace and for everyone to just get along and practice what they want, including ourselves (as long as its not hurting anyone). 

At least that's where I'm at right now. :)


In the end, it's not as black and white as you might think. You always have the choice to pick and choose what feels right to you. 


That's the beauty of being an exmuslim, you have the freedom of being able to do just that without being prosecuted for being a "munafiq" or a "bad muslim". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! I know this is a little late, but I just wanted to let you know what happened to me as a kid when very similar things were happening to me as your daughter.


I was a little on the chubby side as a kid. Not obese or anything, just a bit of baby fat that never really left. When I was about 10 years old, my father started reprimanded me and telling me not to eat so much when we had meals together. Which was okay. But then soon, he started making comments to me about going on diets. I remember him first saying this to me when I was about 11 and me not even knowing what it meant and laughing cause the word sounded funny. 


Anyways, because of the constant criticism from my dad, I always dreaded having meals with my family and started skipping. Whenever I did get hungry enough to have to eat, I would sneak downstairs and grab a small snack and eat it in my room, out of shame that someone would see me and I'd get criticized. 


My mom, who has mental issues of her own, would also constantly bully me about my weight. She would point out that I was bigger than my sister and she had some cruel nicknames for me. 


My siblings' nickname for me was "fat girl" for the longest time, which hadn't really bothered me, until my mom and dad started in with their criticism of my weight.


I can honestly say that all of these things, along with the pressures at school contributed to the development of my very first eating disorder at age 12. 


I'm 22 now, and I've never had a healthy relationship with food since then. 


Some days I hate food, it is the bane of my existence. Other days I can eat a whole jar of Nutella.


Over the summer I dropped down to the lowest weight I had been in a while, which was 90 lbs at a height of 5'6.5. This is a dangerously low bmi. Now I'm at a "healthy" 100 lbs. 


The point being that what you say to your daughter will affect her in the long run. Whether it's in the form of self esteem, self consciousness, embarrassment or an eating disorder (which is what it seems to be leading to from what I've read), it will likely stick with her for a while.


Just be careful.
