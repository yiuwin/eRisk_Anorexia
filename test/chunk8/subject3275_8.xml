	<TEXT> Speaking from personal experience, I'm 5'5" and used to be 190, and have been around 120 for a bit over a year now. When I eat I still never feel like the cue that I should stop eating happens and I have to actively force myself to realize that I am beyond full although I keep fiending for more.  </TEXT>
