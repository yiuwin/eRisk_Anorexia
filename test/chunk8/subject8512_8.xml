	<TEXT> No questions are stupid! Could you give an example though?

When you talk about the interval between C and F# you say it's an augmented fourth but when talking about C and Gb (which are the same keys on a piano) you say it's a diminished fifth (at least in Swedish idk if I translated it correctly)

So what do you mean with enharmonic?

Edit: [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enharmonic) may be helpful!

	<TEXT> On stringed instruments like the violin the note(s) e.g. C# and Db is(are) not the same. But they are on a modern piano. Before equal temperament, one key would be as perfect as if you played it on a violin, but all other keys would be off. Today all keys (on a piano) are off, but only sliiiightly. Google it! :)

This was very helpful! Thank you very much! :)

Edit: added "" and just wanted to clarify, knowing that he was part of the group that developed this total serialism is good enough, knowing all other things he did during his life, makes him very noteworthy in music history, and I'm trying just to figure out what role in music history he had, so this helped me a lot! :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, personally, I think "River Flows In You" is disgustingly cheesy and is not harmonically interesting at all. But with that said, it's not too hard to play, I think you could give it a shot. 
I much prefer "Spring Rain" by Yiruma if you want music in a similar style, but I would say that's just a tad harder to play.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah I'm not the right person to elaborate on this. I don't watch a lot of swedish news, but of what I've heard the last few weeks from the US is that there crime apparently is some kind of a problem, and that it would have to do with immigration. Crime rates are very low. Me personally, living near the second biggest city, have personally never witnessed violence or crime. I know that it happens from time to time, but it's not a huge problem. Sweden is very safe for the most part. You could ask some people in r/sweden if you want more perspectives.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Cubase LE Giveaway! </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I got a serial code for Cubase LE with my new sound card. I don't need it (Logic 4 life) so I figured I could give it away.

It's my birthday today, and I'm giving away things, huh :)

So comment an explanation on why you could use this software and what you intend to do with it.
I think it's mostly useful for newbies that want to get in to creating their own music, or for outlaws that have pirated their DAW and wants to come clean.

I will check in again in 24h and choose a winner (if anyone even has participated :P )

Good luck!

	<TEXT> Yes you can charge it while using it! (That's what happens when it's in the dock, but trough the wall or with power banks are okay as well.)

Depending on how comfortable you find the joycon, you wanna get the pro controller. Most seem to find the joycon the most comfortable when having them separated, without the extra strap. I personally prefer using the included grip.

You probably want to get a sd card sooner or later

	<TEXT> I too can confirm that I personally have none of these issues! However, my right joycon analoug-stick wasn't totally smooth, but I just went back to the store and got it replaced! :)


The charging thing seems to me just be that it charges slower while docked and playing a heavy game lik zelda. I however got it to a 100% while playing zelda, (don't remember for how long though).


I know that there is a chance that the left joycon dissconnects. Maybe nintendo already has done something about this with the one day update. I haven't experienced this while close to my tv/console, but when I walked away with the controllers, the left one disconnected while the right one still could sustain a connection (ca 10 meters trough 3 walls).


Haven't heard anything about crashing.

SD car slots melts, HAHAHAH wtf

Can't say anything about the different screens, but haven't heard this one before either.

I almost wish the joycons where easier to remove without hitting any button.

I guess the dock can scratch the screen if you try to scratch the screen with the dock. But unlikely otherwise. 

Hope you have a nice switch experience! </TEXT>
