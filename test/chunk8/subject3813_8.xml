	<TEXT> Hi. I'm new here. On the FAQ, it said calculate net carbs you just take (carbs)-(fiber). This might be a really silly question, but can I take the total number of carbs consumed for the day and subtract the total amount of  fiber? For example, today I had 45 total grams carbs and 23 grams of fiber. (food diary for reference)

http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/nicoleaxe116

Does that leave me with 22 net carbs? I *think* 45 grams would be too high to enter ketosis, but 22 probably wouldn't be. That's just me guessing though, I've never done this before. Thanks for the input!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi lovely ladies! I do not own one bra that fits. I get boobie muffin top, and the band is way too tight for comfort. My boobs *hurt*, and my back is killing me. I get angry red marks on my shoulders and back. Currently, I wear a 36D. I measured myself using the mywifesbusty, and this is what I got

Under/band:36 in

Leaning over:45 in

Standing up:43 in

Which puts me at a 36FF(UK size)???
I have a few questions for you wonderful gals

1.)how is going from a 36D to a 36FF help the too tight band situation? 

2.) If I wear, say a 38 or 40D, would that theoretically compensate for too small cup and band size at the same time?

3.) If I'm 36 around, why don't my current 36s fit me? I am missing something about bra sizes, or did I just measure incorrectly? Or could be be because I am  ...err a squishy not very toned person?

4.)Are the Curvy Kate bras as pretty in real life as they are online?

Thank you in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to Jamaica for a week with my family. My father doesn't know about a very large tattoo I have on my thigh(http://imgur.com/p3F6M). He doesn't exactly approve of tattoos, let alone one this big. Any ideas on covering up/hiding it?Or do I just suck it up an tell him? If so, any ideas on how to break it to him? Thanks in advance!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just finished my 1st quilt. Now, how on earth do I clean it? (yes, I asked google 1st) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's a tee shirt quilt, backing is cotton. It was machine quilted and bound, not very well. However, since I had to put it on the floor often to work on it, it is covered in dog hair. There are also some chalk markings. I did google how to clean a quilt, but the results were all over the place. How do I get this thing clean? 
Thank in advance, you wonderful quilters!

edit:I machine washed it on the hand wash cycle and put it in the dryer on low. It came out wonderfully, thank you so much! </TEXT>
