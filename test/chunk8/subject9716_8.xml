	<TEXT> "The Brain That Wouldn't Die" was the first MST I watched where I thought "Hey this is kind of interesting!"

If they edited down to the most crucial scenes and kept some of the mystery of the monster (maybe by having him attack the husband off-camera while the wife's head looks on in horror), I think it would have had much more success. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my answer as well. 

I love that even though the "future" is just a mall and a warehouse, it's fairly easy to suspend your disbelief. 

As you pointed out, the time travel aspect isn't confusing, and the way the film was made feels very nostalgic to me. Almost like a lost episode of Magnum PI or Quantum Leap.

 Just some locals having fun with a Cessna and a reenactment group.

This too. I don't feel like they were trying to make the next big blockbuster. Just a fun little action movie. </TEXT>
