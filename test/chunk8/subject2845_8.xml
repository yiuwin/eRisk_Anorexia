	<TEXT> You are so right. This post really helped me make sense of things in my anxious little brain. I really appreciate it and I have pretty much come to the same conclusion about my job. I don't want to lose it, I really love it and it's such an awesome opportunity, but so is this trip. And both Europe and my boyfriend, separate of one another, are more important than any job. Hopefully they will understand that. Thank you again so much! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you :) just typing it out really made me feel a lot better. And I have a HUGE fear of flying too! So yeah, I'm not excited about that part at all. I've actually been having some crazy flight related nightmares lately. Good luck with your own anxiety troubles and thanks for the support, I cannot express enough how much it means. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may just be pushing your body too hard at times. I run marathons and this is very common with runners I know (and myself.) I think anxiety plays a part in it - and the fear of not knowing what it actually is doesn't help. But I agree with dbd1963, you should go tell your doctor about this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I frequently get swollen glands all around my thrat and mouth and spots on my tongue and cheeks that my doctor says is caused by my anxiety - I'm not sure if this is the same though. Hope I helped at least a little! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't let yourself feel weak, because you definitely aren't. Anxiety is such a funny thing because it's really just our brains messing with us. If you don't feel comfortable going out to dinner, then my advice would be to try to talk to your mom about it. If she knew what you were going through I think she would understand. If you're concerned about worrying her, practice what you're going to say and find the right wording. If you end up going though, just don't let it get to you. Half of anxiety is the anxiety of anxiety - if that makes sense. Good luck! I hope everything goes well and your mom has a lovely birthday! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know exactly how you feel! I'm 22 as well and I was so scared the first time I saw my therapist. Just know that they're there to help you. They are not going to think you are crazy, they deal with people like us all the time! :) And don't worry about explaining yourself properly, if they're good they'll get it no matter how you explain it. The first time I went to my therapist, I'm pretty sure I almost had a panic attack just because of the pressure to explain myself properly. It wasn't easy but he was very understanding and patient. I still get anxious to go see him, but it's getting a lot better. Half the battle is setting up the 1st appointment! Don't be nervous, you're making progress already! Good luck! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where to even begin. I am 22 years old, working at an optometry office and in a wonderful supportive relationship with a long time friend and somewhat recently (September) boyfriend. He is more supportive than I could ever ask for when it comes to my anxiety and other issues (I have been struggling with anorexia for about ten years as well) My parents are also super supportive, and my mom struggled with anxiety/panic attacks and eating as well, so it's really great because I always have someone that I can talk to. I also see a therapist who specializes in anxiety and eating disorders (and addiction, but it's not too relevant in this situation) and he is fabulous. I really think that he's helping me get somewhere with my anxiety. The frequency of my panic attacks have decreased, if only slightly. But I still cannot control my day to day anxiety levels. My hands are frequently numb and I frequently see stars and spots. I get so light headed that I have to sit down, or my stomach bothers me so much (IBS diagnosis that my doctor says is linked with anxiety as well - go me!) that wherever I am, I need to go home. It's getting to the point that I really don't know what to do. I feel as if I'm about to break down at multiple points throughout the day, and I know it's stupid to say, but it just makes me feel so weak. I think what is making me so stressed is the fact that my boyfriend is from Germany, and he graduates this semester and goes home. I currently have plans to visit him from the beginning of june to the beginning of july, but now my manager is stepping back on that time allotment (even though they approved it at least a month ago) Now, I booked all of the tickets and everything, both to get there and back and for all of the traveling we plan to do within Europe. Most of the tickets we got for trains and whatnot are non refundable. (about $350) Also, just changing the flight will cost upwards of $500. I love my boyfriend more than anything, and the fact that this is the last time I'll get to see him until he gets a job and we figure out where we're going to live just kills me. I've always wanted to go to Europe (I'm a huuge history buff) and I've been planning this trip for about two years (it didn't always involve my boyfriend in a romantic way) It's just...I already don't know what I'm going to do when he leaves on May 24th, and this was what was keeping me going. I can put up with anything as long as I have something that will come out of it. But lately (since Wed - when my manager talked to me) I haven't been able to turn my anxiety off at all (and it's usually hard enough!) I spoke with my manager today and she feels terrible, and hopefully this will all work itself out. I guess I just needed to rant because I don't know what else to do. I'm going to do more research tonight, so if anyone is interested I can keep you all posted. Thank you so much for reading.
