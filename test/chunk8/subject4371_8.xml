	<TEXT> I think I have slightly more Magic cards, but not by much. I wish Commander players knew how good this game was - a game designed by Richard Garfield **for multiplayer** , revolving around frikkin' vampires.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People are excited for this reprint because it is fairly expensive and this reprint will make it more accessible (cheaper) for people to get.
The argument for this card being good for the game is that it keeps people from getting too greedy with their mana base when deck building, it sort of keeps people in check. Although, there are plenty of people that agree with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I mean is, it goes against the theme of the set. It is obviously powerful, but possibly a bad choice for the theme they were going for in limited. It will ruin everybody's fun.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The art is "prettier" but doesn't fit the action/chaos of the what the card does as well as the original. This one almost seems serene by comparison. I'm not complaining, it's ok to have different versions, but both have strengths.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How much of the vehicle's deck power comes from the creatures though? [[Veteran Motorist]] and [[Toolcraft Exemplar]]  are pretty outrageous.
You could look at it as a mistake for standard, but over all I think the risk in terms of power level and coolness factor in the long term was worth it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This makes sense in the context of testing. When you trust everybody on the team and cheating isn't an issue, I would assume Cockatrice is faster (I've never played MTGO). Also faster than paper magic in terms of deck building/tuning.  </TEXT>

I will actually save episodes of this for long road trips. I feel like no other podcast goes as deep and thorough as they do. They had an entire episode just about [[Gitaxian Probe]]. But yes, the set reviews are the most fascinating and fun.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have the feeling, justified by evidence or not, that it is going to replace Modern. I'm not sure what Frontier is like because I haven't done any research, but I'd imagine that Frontier feels like what we want Modern to feel like - that is, a format that is not "figured out" and ripe for experimentation. Modern in comparison to that seems more like Legacy. </TEXT>
