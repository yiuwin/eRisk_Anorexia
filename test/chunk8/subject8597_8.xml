	<TEXT> Maybe that's where he was stationed, but he (like myself, and many, many proud US soldiers) proudly picked his future wife  from among the youthful specimens at WJHS (now WAMS). Once he selected Pricilla to be his bottom bitch, he grabbed his rifle and kept the darkness at bay while his concubine safely grew into puberty. Wiesbaden has never felt safer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great comparison.

All that "cinematic" filler in the PCE version... Was that made from scratch for this release? 

I played Golden Axe a bunch in the arcades, and recall it's presentation as very similar to the Genesis release. This was in the US though (a few EU cabinets too).

Gameplay on PCE makes the Megadrive port look fucking incredible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I joined so that I could comment on how shitty this show is 3/4ths of the time, and stuck around so that I could save dear souls from wasting their precious time. 

Seriously, this show sucks dick. Not well, either. With a dry unwilling mouth. Kinda like fucking a loofah.

	<TEXT> Man, this show sucks.

It's got one acceptable episode out of every three to four.

I watched from beginning to end during original airdates, and cringed most of the time. The last season was the worst. Shitty show. Shitty, shitty fucking show. 

Don't do it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like some of the details here.

The latticed exoskeleton. No "bones" were evident any time we saw an android decapitated or bisected in previous flicks. Just skin and a bunch of milky tubes. The thin frame seen here is a great looking support structure.

Also, the acrylic face looks like what we saw when the Nostromo crew torched Ash and his skin melted off.

Good stuff.

	<TEXT> I've let the Engineers look grow on me, but this is so much better. Looks a bunch more like that decomposing mess Dallas found hunched over in its chair. Also looks way more "alien" and less "guy with an elephant mask". 

This thing is hype.

	<TEXT> Dudes an underwear model. Acts as well as any mannequin. Pretty face, shit else.

Like that guy in Avatar, and that dude who played John Connor in the second to last Terminator flick.

Fair enough to look at. One mode (bored). No charisma.

Shitty excuse for an "actor".

	<TEXT> I predict his tagalong flu Virus will be the catalyst that spreads the Alien infection, and that David will attempt to counter it's effects by splicing Francos flu with praying mantis dna and spraying it all over everybody, only to watch the crew turn into mantis creatures with a boner for Mor... I mean Kenny Powers. Taking DNA from several sources, including cactus, golden retriever, shark, and dinosaur, David creates a third airborne virus that results in turning the remaining crew into disfigured, humanoid blobs that the android dubs "Cronenbergs." The planet is soon overrun with these disfigured monsters, so David steals Kenny Powers away to another world to begin anew... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gilbert Gottfried, Chris Kattan, Verne Troyer, and Melissa McCarthy should all team up on a digital/practical vfx monstrosity. 

McCarthy and Troyer could do the physical mocap, Kattan and Gottfried can do voiceover. 

Or maybe they could settle on Shaq. I'd accept that. </TEXT>

Fuck, I know this means disappointment. That whole movie blew horse dick.

Hard to get anyone to take my recommendation on this one... Shit it was hard for the person who recommended it to me to fire it up, but man, after I did.

Changed my mindset on non-animated musical films. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yah. That alien looks like shit. Like it came from the same dimension doofus Rick comes from in Rick and Morty. I bet it eats it own shit.

The rest aren't so bad actually, but with such a weak alien, why bother?
