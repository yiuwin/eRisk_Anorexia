	<TEXT> I'm less interested in the "where are they now" stories than I am in the "how did they get here" stories. I'd like to know the story that lead up to our bried glimpse of backpack guy, the man in the red poncho, and the group Tyreese, Carol, and the kids encountered on the tracks to Terminus. Each of those groups must've had an interesting story that died with them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it's vastly easier to get away from Earth's problems on Earth than it is by going to another planet. No one who can afford to go to Mars would ever have a better quality of life there than they would here on Earth. The people whose circumstances might improve by trying to survive on another planet (the oppressed or impoverished) could never afford to go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the highest tax bracket in quebec is 25% and the highest federal bracket in canada is 33%. i'm no accountant, but it looks like a hockey player in quebec would be taking home 42% of his gross income.

edit: actually "Quebec chooses to receive part of its health and social transfers in tax points instead of cash. To compensate for this, federal personal income taxes on income earned in Quebec are reduced by 16.5% of federal tax. This is referred to as the Quebec Abatement." so it looks like the total take home would be about 58% </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well most Canadian jurisdictions tax at a higher rate than American ones, so American teams can compete better for talent by promising their players more take home play. From a player perspective a player on a team in Florida can take home ~90% of his pay while a player on a team in Quebec only take home ~50% of his pay. From a team perspective it's the equivalent of Canadian teams having a lower salary cap.

Also, any player on a Canadian team is under the constant lash of media scrutiny. Lots of players don't thrive in those conditions and would rather play in a smaller American market. Think Phil Kessel, who has had a career rejuvenation by moving to Pittsburgh.

And, most Canadian cities have much worse weather and culture than American cities. All else being equal, would you rather play in Winnipeg or in San Jose? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this is kind of a joke to everyone, but is this an indication that Canadian teams are at a disadvantage to American teams? I'd be pretty pissed as a Canadian team owner if I knew the deck was stacked against me from the start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> deleted data isn't really removed, it's just that your operating system no longer prevents that data from being overwritten. you could delete all your data and turn off your computer for a year and turn it back on and most of that data would still be there. but if you delete data and go about using your computer as per normal all that data will gradually get overwritten with new data. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> and where he explains that he's quarreling with his mother because he can't keep himself from snooping through her private things. wish i could remember the exact quote because it's so awkward.

edit: found the quote: "Dwight called my house, but he didnt realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I cant stay out of her stuff. " </TEXT>

	<TEXT> loved both FF2 and FF3 as a kid and have completed them both multiple times as an adult. FF2 is quite linear which makes the narrative very tight and keeps the action quite fast paced. unforunately i find the character interactions to be cringily juvenile. still, it's a masterpiece and totally enjoyable. most of the story is told from the perspective of one character so it's very immersive in that regard. FF3 is much more open and has some great optional plots, characters, and character development. The story is a bit more mature, thankfully. There is no single main character, and since they are all given lots of attention in the narrative there is plenty of opportunity to bond with whichever character stands out for you. There are a couple of annoying quest-y type things you have to do. the main bad guy is amazing. the visual and sound design represent a significant jump from the previous game. </TEXT>
