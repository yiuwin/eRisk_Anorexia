	<TEXT> So two points:

1) While I don't disagree, benefits need to be at least somewhat inclusive.  Universal healthcare is a great example.

2) EVERYBODY's wellbeing is enabled by living in society.  Everybody needs to pay for these things.  Not just the top tax bracket. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay lets try this another way.

Lets say you make university free for everybody.  Then, at least you can say their children (me) gets free education, so they get some benefit that is equally available to all Canadians.  Or if you made dental care free for all Canadians, they would benefit from that too.

But that doesn't apply with LOW-INCOME housing for example.  They don't benefit from that.

I'm not asking they get any more than other Canadians.  But you have make benefits apply to Canadians of across all income levels if you want Canadians across all income levels on board. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not the point, and no that is absolutely NOT what i meant.  I didn't say they never got anything in the first place, but the raises didn't result in any benefits for them.

They live in Alberta, so between the NDP and the Liberals their tax bill went way up in the past couple years a fair bit.  Where did the money go?  Well, the NDP commited a lot more money to low-income legal assistance for example.  Liberals opened up EI benefits more and commited money to low-income housing.

So you raised their tax burden, but the things the money was commited to held no benefit for them.  I'm not even against any of those things, but I can't help but think they have a point as to why they are the only ones being asked to pay for these, particuarly when they do nothing for them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats the thing.  Everybody wants something but wants someone else to pay for it.

My parents would probably be considered upper-middle class.  They may technically be the 1% (I'm not sure exactly where the cutoff is), but they're definetly not what you think of when you think of the 1% (no private jet, no mansion, no Ferrari).  Their anger is that everytime taxes get raised on the "1%" (shorthand for the top tax bracket), they end up paying way more, but they still pay a higher percent than the super-rich that are able to use tax loopholes to lower their burden.  And meanwhile, what do they get for their money?  Nothing.  It goes off to help somebody else.

If we want to do this, it has to be equitable.  Everyone needs to agree to contribute and pay in, no one gets to shove the costs onto someone else.  And everybody gets some benefit.  It doesn't all go towards helping the poor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its not that simple.

Our Conservatives would never dare suggest abolishing universal healthcare for example (although I suppose that might fit the keep-the-status-quo definition of Conservatism).  Although certain individuals may call for it, the DP and their last Presidential candidate still do not endorse it.  You could also make an argument that our finance/banking/insurance industry remained more tightly regulated even under Conservative government than the US under Democrats.

Depending on the issue, they may be considered left of the Democrats.  When it comes to social issues or climate change among many other issues, they're probably to the right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the conversation.  Glad to hear the viewpoint.

I don't neccesarily want to try and change your mind, because I do respect your opinion.  Just hoping I can show another perspective.  I'll try and source things well so you can read more if you would like and you know my sources are trustworthy.  

The reason I support action is actually because of a few reasons, but largely the economy.  Climate change has pretty enormous consequences worldwide, and according to this [study will shave 23 percent off the global GDP by 2100](http://time.com/4082328/climate-change-economic-impact/).  Another study indicated that climate change [is costing us already reducing GDP growth by 1.2%](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/26/climate-change-damaging-global-economy).  [Here is a survey of economists opinions on climate change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution).  The long and short of it is they overwhelmingly believe cutting emissions will be best for the economy.

As far as Canada in specific goes it is [estimated from a government analysis by 2020 we will be seeing $5 Billion in economic damage anually](http://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/climate-change-will-cost-canada-billions-report-1.704453).  That could climb as high as $91 Billion by the 2050's.  The [Bank of Canada](http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2017/03/thermometer-rising-climate-change-canada-economic-future/) has repeatedly stressed the negative impact of climate change on our economy as well in addition to the need to curb emissions.

And its pretty agreed upon it will be cheaper to avert.  [Citigroup](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/31/citi-report-slowing-global-warming-would-save-tens-of-trillions-of-dollars) has said so, and even [Exxon Mobil says it will be cheaper](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meeting-a-global-carbon-limit-is-cheaper-than-avoiding-one/).  [Here](http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/why-concerns-over-carbon-pricing-are-misplaced/) is a really good article on carbon pricing and why the econonic costs of it really are very minimal.

So I don't view climate change as a sacrifice, I view it as an investment.

Secondly, it becomes a question of human life.  Numbers are easy to compare, lives are not.  Some independant reports say [its contributed to 400,000 deaths a year](https://newrepublic.com/article/121032/map-climate-change-kills-more-people-worldwide-terrorism) and will be 600,000 by 2030.  The World Health Organization has the number a little lower, at [250,000 a year by 2030](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/).  Either way, it kills a lot of people.

Lastly, we have a moral reason.  It would be one thing if our decisions only affected us.  But they don't.  They have consequences for the whole world.  And [it hits the poorest parts of the world dis-porportionally the hardest](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/27/climate-change-poor-countries-ipcc).  There is no right or wrong answer, but we have to be aware that our actions hurt what are already the most vulnerable regions on Earth.

Anyways, hope I provided some insight =D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To a degree (with Trudeau) his resource extraction message has been consistent.  He just emphasizes different points and priorities to appeal to his audience, as does every politician ever.

At an oil and gas conference, he emphasizes that Canada is still commited to extracting oil and gas.  At a town hall event, he emphasizes we're phasing oil out.

Those statements aren't neccesarily inconsistent.  He has legitimate actions to back up both points (pipeline approval and carbon pricing).  Its just picking and choosing when to talk about what. </TEXT>

Thats an extremely poor and unreliable indicator of demographic as a whole.  I think the survey I linked to shows it is in fact an important issue for the 18-35 demographic.  

But out of curiousity, why do you feel its a completely unimportant issue? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If he believed it was a serious issue, he would have a serious plan to address it.  He does not.

This is the relevant piece from his Wikipedia page:

Bernier has suggested that there are uncertainties or exaggerations about anthropogenicclimate changeand its significance.Bernier later clarified that he wanted scientists to stay out ofpublicpolicy. He also mentioned that he did not want the government to dictatescientificpolicy.Bernier believes that entrepreneurship and less interventionist polices can lead to a clearer environment.

It's pretty textbook stuff.  You just say "Oh, yeah but we aren't 100% certain about this or that, so we better not do anything".  If he has moved his rhetoric, his policy certainly hasn't followed.

Personally, I don't care much whether a politician believes its real or not anymore.  Too many like to say its real, but hide behind inaction.  I care about if they have a clear and serious policy response to it, and Bernier has made it clear what category he falls under. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Air pollution and climate change may be somewhat separate, but they're also inherently connected.  Solving climate change will also reduce air pollution (closing coal, using renewables, less gas vehicles, etc,.) and still provide significant benefits to Canada.  

So the heart of the argument seems to lie in that Canada cannot single-handedly solve climate change, therefore we shouldn't act.  Now I would point out there is a "leadership" factor to this, if we do nothing it only encourages the same of others (just look at the number of Canadians saying we can't have a carbon tax because the US doesn't have one, a line Harper used with a cap-and-trade system years ago as well).  But this argument still doesn't make any sense at all to me.  When Hitler invaded Poland, Canada didn't pack it in and give up because we could not solely defeat Hitler.  Of course, we could have sat at home and let others do the dirty work while we reaped the benefits of a safe world, but we decided we would act none the less because with the cooperation of other countries, it was an accomplish-able and beneficial goal.

But none the less, why are we only considering Canada?  The rest of the world both contributes to and suffers from the problem, and is also acting to solve the problem with us (as the Paris Agreement exemplifies).  In a purely analytical cost-benefit analysis, would we not simply be responsible for solving for the portion of the damage we caused?  Sure, you can't entirely solve the problem within Canada's borders, but countries all around the world are taking very serious action to solve climate change (China just created a national cap-and-trade for example).  So knowing that action is undoubtedly much cheaper than inaction ([twice as cheap](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meeting-a-global-carbon-limit-is-cheaper-than-avoiding-one/), according to Exxon Mobil of all people), and also knowing that other countries across the world are taking serious steps already (and thus far, have been far more proactive than Canada has) and are continuing to ramp up efforts, and adhering to a cost-benefit analysis, how can you arrive at the conclusion that inaction is indeed the best way forward?

Just as an additional note, [this Citigroup report](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/31/citi-report-slowing-global-warming-would-save-tens-of-trillions-of-dollars) actually shows action as marginally cheaper than inaction solely due to fuel savings and energy efficiency (so not even considering the avoided costs of climate change, air pollution, or otherwise yet).  So even in a solely within Canada's borders (and assuming all other countries refuse to act) cost-benefit viewpoint, Action still has a strong argument as more beneficial to Canada.

Lastly, this is more my opinion, but its more of a humanitarian question, but I believe humanitarianism crosses all party lines.  [It's been shown](http://time.com/4209510/climate-change-poor-countries/) that climate change hits the poorest regions of the world dis-proportionally hardest.

So the question becomes: are we satisfied with doing nothing, knowing that our actions our hurting the weakest and most vulnerable parts of the world the most?

There is no right answer to that one, but my personal opinion is that we are morally obliged to do at least *something* semi-serious, and I don't think that opinion is an un-Conservative one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be sufficient shorthand if they had a plan of their own, but they don't.  So when they rail against the destruction of the carbon tax, they mean they want inaction because they offer no solution.

I haven't seen any research to suggest the money would be better spent in Asia myself, but if that really is the way the CPC determines best, then that's fine by me.  At least you have a plan, now you have to commit to it.  To me, that wouldn't make much sense because the local effects of air pollution are very significant, so obviously we would want those benefits here in Canada, not abroad if you were looking at the greatest benefit for Canada.

I do see what you mean, but I also don't much understand the argument.  Every country has to do their part if we do want to avoid the damage, and Canada is no exception (we are still the 8th largest total emitter in the world).

The way I see it, Canada has to at the bare minimum do our part of things (which in [in the past](https://germanwatch.org/en/download/10407.pdf) Canada has absolutely failed to do).  There really is no excuse for Canada to register less policy support than almost every single other country in the world, including dictatorships and impoverished countries (which we did under Harper).  If Canada can't do our part, how do look to China or India to do theirs?

And furthermore, is us shunning our responsibility and shoving the burden onto other countries really the approach we want to take?   If so, then fine.  But let's at least be honest about it; we know something has to be done, but we are going to rely on others to do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely not.  A Conservative Party would support a balanced budget, or at least a lot closer to it.  They would still also support tax cuts and smaller government in general.  That's essentially how it was under Joe Clark.  That is a massive difference, lets not act like they're the same thing.

There are also different stances you can take on different issues with being regressive.  Support decriminalization would have been a perfectly legitimate and distinct and still somewhat progressive idea without aligning themselves with the Liberals.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally see what you mean, and I wish the Conservative base would actually adopt that line more.  The "Okay, let's do something but let's be careful we measure what we do against the harm avoided as strategically as possible" line is exactly what the Conservatives *should* be advocating in my opinion, that's the appropriate Conservative stance on the issue.  They should be promoting pragmatism and and caution to ensure we don't spend more avoiding a problem than the problem would have cost us.

However, sadly that has not thus far been the Conservative stance at all.  It's been climate change deniers mixed in with advocates of total inaction, which is really quite boggling because I don't see you how you can say the best course of action is to [do nothing](http://time.com/4082328/climate-change-economic-impact/) when anyone that has seen the science knows the [costs are significant](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-could-cost-billions-a-year-by-2020-1.1097373).

That's what I mean by cares "as least a little bit".  I think it's time the Conservative Party admits climate change does in fact require action, just careful and calculated action.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, a different kind of conservative more like.

More a socially progressive (or at least not regressive) and fiscally conservative party that at least cares about climate change just a little bit.

I think he is largely right.  I don't believe being against gay marriage, promoting inaction on climate change, and pushing back against things like marijuana legalization is the path forward for the Conservative Party.  These things are all far more popular with younger people, and unimportant or unpopular with older people.

EDIT: If anyone thinks this sounds crazy or un-Conservative, I would like to point out that the Conservative Party has taken a very different shape in the past.  Under [Joe Clark for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Clark#Early_political_career), the Conservatives supported ideas such as marijuana decriminalization (in the 1970's none the less) and a guaranteed minimum income, among other highly socially progressive policies. </TEXT>

This is something that is very important to young people in particular and is only becoming more important as time goes on.  Until the Conservatives take it seriously, they'll struggle to find a majority I think.  So while he should appeal to the base just fine, I have my doubts that he can find broader success. </TEXT>
