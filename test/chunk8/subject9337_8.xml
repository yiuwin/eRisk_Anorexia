	<TEXT> This is so on point and the struggle is so real. T_T  Right now pretty much my ONLY reason for wanting to be better is for my boyfriend.  He doesn't pressure me or anything but I really do not want to put him through hell because of this stupid disorder.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, eating a large deficit will make your body use its stored energy, not attempt to store more. You know what makes your body "store" more calories?  When you eat more calories than you need.  If you're talking about losing a significant amount weight, and then going back to eating "normally," then yeah you're probably going to gain some back because that "normal" way you were eating was fueling a larger body.  After you lose weight, your body is smaller and doesn't need as many calories for functioning.  Your body does not get "scared" and metabolism is not a sentient being.  In actuality, obese people have higher "metabolisms" because they need to consume a lot of calories to keep them at that weight.

edited to say I know that was a lot of passive aggressive quotation marks but I'm sick of people scaring other people into thinking that being fat is inevitable and that keeping weight off is dangerous and or impossible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Under eating will kill you a lot faster than overeating will.  I started overweight and then ate 800-1200 calories (so not even THAT low really) for about 2 years and my bmi went from 27 ish to 15 ish.  For the most part I never went under 800 calories.  I never even fasted on purpose.  Overeating for years might eventually kill you, but probably not for decades.  It gets to a point where the concern becomes very real if someone suspects you have an eating disorder, and if people wait until you're literally skin and bones to become concerned, it's probably going to be a lot harder to help you.

That point aside, there's definitely people out there that truly aren't concerned and probably just feel guilty themselves for eating so much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Going through binge cycles because of restriction is pretty common.  A few years ago, after I had restricted so heavily for so long, something in me just snapped and I just gorged myself for months.  It definitely was one of the hardest times in my life; I felt completely out of control and starving no matter what.  Nothing in particular stopped it...I just gave up and rode it out.  Then I started over with restricting.  To prevent the mega binge cycle from happening again, I don't restrict as much as I used to, and allow myself to eat to my TDEE on days when I have the urge to binge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is mine.  I've never liked it.  I hate looking at it and I will hold my breath if I have to use it while preparing food for someone else.  When I was in inpatient for my ED it was the one thing I told them that I wouldn't eat and it was non-negotiable.  Unfortunately I did have to eat it there once, in a tuna sandwich.  I pretty much had to disassociate while I forced it down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't have to be like that.  You don't have to purge once and then be in the mindset of, "well that's it I did it now im bulimic and will forever be a vicious cycle."  I have a very weird purging history that doesn't seem to follow any kind of pattern or rule.  Like this year I've probably purged about 15 times.  Usually after a binge, but I still binge without purging way more.  Doing it once does not mean you will develop an uncontrollable compulsion.

About worrying about feeling rude for refusing food, I'd really recommend trying to get over that.  If people are getting mad at you for politely saying no thank you then that's their problem and maybe they are not worth hanging out with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really sure what my highest weight was but I think it was 165-170 which was overweight.  The first time I started restricting I got down to 98 pounds, then about two years later gained it all back, and then lost most of it again because I am insane :') </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try 1200 for awhile.  You definitely won't gain and you'll probably still lose.  Feel ya on the boyfriend thing; mine will usually go until DINNER without eating.  He just is not hungry in the morning and then gets caught up with work.  Food just seems so much like an afterthought to him, makes me jealous.  Eggs aren't my fav either but they are great for vitamins and keeping you feeling a bit fuller.  Experiment with different ways of preparing them and maybe you'll find some way you like. :) </TEXT>
