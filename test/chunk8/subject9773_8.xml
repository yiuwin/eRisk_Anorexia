	<TEXT> Im BP2 and my biggest issue (like /u/nippleeee) is with depression. I only take Lamotrigine and Prozac. My hypomanic states aren't as awesome (okay, not awesome at all, but you get it) as I read that some of  you guys have. I just sleep way less, play video games with increased vigor, and make very questionable sexual decisions. Like Craigslist. 

I have noted that I had to get a lot more help for depression (i.e. Prozac), and that Lamotrigine has stopped me from cycling up the way that I used to. It did help me focus and figure out what "ambition" meant though, but that doesn't sound what you are talking about because hypomania generally made it volitile and sporadic, now it is just a steady constant. 

Best of luck with the depression and anxiety, we've all been there/are there, as well as always be there for you. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Question: Why do all of us unanimously hate taking pictures? Is that just an introverted thing, or what?

Like most everyone else, I hate it, but I tolerate it to an extent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sword Art Online is an anime. 
everyone is trapped in the game, people die, more bad stuff happens, and then there is a poorly written second story arc that makes me sad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't offer any help on this one, only solidarity. **I feel you.**

Shit is fucking hard and fucked up. I'm hanging on to school by thread and I've buried in a hole so deep that I don't know if I can climb out of it. Instead of talking to my professors and getting caught up on all of my work I stay home, smoke way too much weed, and play far too many hours worth of video games. I just can't get myself up to deal with that initial stress and anxiety to deal with school and get it fixed -- I feel happy-ish and safe getting super baked in my room, not doing school.

We're a mess.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no idea how to sort out my "feelings". They are all so out of control and unstable that I have no idea how to function. I have a wonderful laundry list of mental illnesses that specifically make "feels" really hard to pin down and deal with. I have Bipolar(2), Borderline Personality Disorder, and a thing called "Nonverbal Learning Disorder" (NLD). 

I know I shouldn't be complaining because some people have it so much worse and deal with things infinitely worse every day, but still.. AGHH. I wake up and I might be manic out of my mind and clean the apartment like I was on a meth binge, or incredibly depressed and not crawl out of bed for anything.. who knows? I SURE DON'T! The rest of my emotions are equally volatile and so unstable that I might cry, laugh, or an uncomfortable combination of the two if someone looks at me in a weird way.

How does one function when their personality is all about the feels and feeling things, when they have so many other things that manufacture extreme and volatile emotions that aren't even consistent?! I'm medicated up and about to schedule a psychiatrist but none of it feels like it will be enough or what I need. I just don't know what to do. 

Sorry for ranting. I know none of this is really about MBTI or INFP's but this sub feels like a safe space and I love to come here to vibe with all of the posts when my day is getting a little too rough. Thanks for letting me yell at the world about how angry I am that I got such a fucked up brain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How bad is it that I recognize the manipulation in most things I do, but I don't want stop it?  I have seemingly zero control over my emotions (bipolar as well) and it helps feel some level of control over my life. I'm not malicious and do my best to not hurt anyone, I'm just trying to keep from being hurt by myself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hardly ever read fiction. If I read fiction it is nearly always related to some sort of Critical Theory, Philosophy, or some sort of meaningful and classic texts (i.e. Lord of the Flies, Grapes of Wrath, Brave New World, etc..)

I will admit that if I am overly stressed or on a vacation and want to *try* to turn my brain off for a while I'll read fiction. I call it "Cotton Candy Reading" because I move through it so fast and there is (generally) little substance.

But honestly, I just love reading. I **really** love reading. </TEXT>
