	<TEXT> I did read your post. Well just scout their units out, build anti. What's difficult?

People can choose infantry it's the first unit type to access in the game, of course people will use it.

Would you rather people wait till 20/30mn in game and attack with max upgraded units? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This game is a real time strategy, it involves continuous scouting and preparing of units. 

If you keep getting killed by infantry who's the noob? The guy winning 3/4 games in 20mins or you who wins one game every half an hour?

	<TEXT> Is the suspect not allowed to be worried to find an officer to shoot first before the suspect? 

I'm not defending the convict, he had a history in prison and had just came out. 

I only saw that guy run away, does that warrant being shot in the back? 

I don't know what happened before so perhaps they did the right thing. Just my thoughts on the subject is all! I'm from the UK so as you know gun laws here are very strict!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Title really explains it. 

Talking to a colleague at work and they said when they go to university they can get some money for saying that they are vegetarian or vegan.

Is this actually true? Like people need to be bribed? 

Thing that makes it worse that this person was once a vegetarian now an omni so it's not even like they are doing it any reason but monetary gain.. 

People make me so sad..  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the UK, currently going from my road bike to a BMX. 

Road bike was for travel means but now I have a motorbike. I miss the feeling of the pushing pedals and just getting out there. I want to have fun on a bicycle again.

I'm 6ft 6 and have been struggling to find frames that would go up to my size. Anyone been in my situation and found a solution?

I'm wanting to build my own bike up, to make it my precious. Any websites or tips would be recommended! 

Looking forward to hitting the road again.. 

Edit : Wanting to use the bike for tricks on land not so much jumps, so would like somewhat of a sturdy bike.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there everyone, wonder if anyone can help me.

I am working for a company that recently acquired another company in the area. They have a big online presence on Facebook but the previous owners are unable to find the log in details. 

Is there any way that the account can be verified by a business address or verified in any way so that we can edit and put out new posts. 

We don't want to start a new account for the company as we'd lose a lot of followers and have to gain them again.

I've tried to contact Facebook but can't seem to find anything. 

Any help would be appreciated!

	<TITLE> Reading the UK NHS guidelines on milk </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-25 03:14:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Milk is especially important for young children. They should drink whole milk until they are two years old because they may not get the calories they need from lower-fat milks.

Cows' milk should not be given as a drink until a baby is one year old as it doesn't contain the balance of nutrients a baby needs.

From the age of two, children can gradually move to semi-skimmed milk as a main drink as long as they are eating a varied and balanced diet and growing well.


Just reading this makes me think how far we actually have to come..  </TEXT>
