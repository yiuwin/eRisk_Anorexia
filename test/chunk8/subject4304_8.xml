	<TEXT> My dog's called Bob. Everyone says it's a terrific name for a dog, and it's great that it can't be shortened to anything.

I also knew of someone who owned a former police dog German shepherd called Doris, who lost her job due to having particular distain for black people and homosexuals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hate to break this to you, but getting a dog might not be the best idea.

I feel that the only real way to get a dog to integrate properly with ones family is for you to integrate with him, if you see what I mean. I feel like you need to bring him into your home in order to remove a seperation because you will be his family and therefore his pack, and packs live and work as one. </TEXT>

What about a springer spaniel? Again, luck of the draw whether you get a frantic one, but ours is the most chilled out dog I've ever met.

My worry with a Boston is that they are quite small and in my experience, small = yappy.

Are you looking for a working type breed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was brought up in quite a Christian family, but many of my friends were quite atheist. So I drifted away from my faith because I saw how the world we lived in could have come about without divine intervention.

Then it came full circle when I realised that the only way that our world with all it's complexities could have ended with us is with a guiding hand, and evolution and natural selection are also all real, but it was all put into motion by God, and the systems necessary for the process that is evolution were put in and guided by God himself. </TEXT>
