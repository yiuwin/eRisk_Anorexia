	<TITLE> [College Political Science] Question about judicial review essay </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-07 20:22:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, you might have seen my post a couple days ago on this essay and starting it, here is the prompt once again:
3. Please list the component parts (built up case by case over time...) of judicial review. Which case first established this power of the Supreme Court? In what significant way does judicial review run counter to democratic theory? How could a judiciary possessing such an overwhelming power still be considered the weakest of the three branches of government? Finally, in the spirit of checks and balances, how can the power of judicial review be countered by the people, and/or by their elected representatives?

So I was wondering howto answer the last question, I can't seem to understand or even find anything online about countering judicial review.

Thanks to all! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean if OP describes something he believes, he believes what he is describing. But if the guy does not think the interpretation is accurate then he does not believe his description; therefore, he doesnt believe it. However, I do understand your defense, sometimes answers require more detail, but I think under this circumstance it just makes people scratch their heads in total confusion, not to mention the excessive wording instead of keeping it concise. I mean, if I told you a rose is green but I'm completely color blind, you would most likely not believe it, but that is me misinterpreting what's really happening. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [College Political Science] Need help understanding a prompt for an essay on judicial review </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-05 01:10:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys so I'm currently doing an essay on judicial review here is the prompt:

Please list the component parts (built up case by case over time...) of judicial review. Which case first established this power of the Supreme Court? In what significant way does judicial review run counter to democratic theory? How could a judiciary possessing such an overwhelming power still be considered the weakest of the three branches of government? Finally, in the spirit of checks and balances, how can the power of judicial review be countered by the people, and/or by their elected representatives?

Can somebody explain what my professor means by component parts on a case by case manner? I already included the Marbury v. Madison case. What other cases should i mention? I tried contacting him through email about this and he's not responding.

Thanks! </TEXT>
