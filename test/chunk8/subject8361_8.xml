	<TEXT> My FMIL, Miserable Monica, is in town. Yayyyy...

My fiance is from Portugal. We met in university 2.5 years ago and became officially BF/GF exactly 4 days later. We moved in together a few months later, then he proposed this January. He's perfect, wonderful, amazing -- super happy. 

His family is BONKERS. Most stories exemplifying that are about his dad and this is JNMIL, but believe you me, crazy people. They also hate me. Since the start, they've tried to break us up using their financial leverage and ultimatums (tuition=student visa=us together). Caused depression, stress, tears, and drama -- but no break up. 

Now we are blissfully engaged and so excited to share our lives together. We make a kick-ass team. His family cut him off financially, as expected, and tried all sorts of manipulation to get him to call-it-off/postpone. "Are you trying to kill your grandmother? It just might work you know!"; "If you get married a year later we will attend and pay for tuition,"; "How dare you let a woman speak to your father that way! If someone spoke to my father that way they'd be out the door!!!! IMMEDIATELY!!!" (context: his dad asked me if I trust him and I said no). They've contacted lawyers in the US and over there to see if they can prevent this. They have also told us that police are involved. They forward us emails from "lawyers" who diagnose my fiance and I will all sorts of mental illnesses and try to argue for impaired judgement. 

His mom, Miserable Monica, and dad are divorced. She's supposed to be the "normal" one. I am pretty sure she sends emoji frowns more often than any other character. I have stopped talking to her all together because I just can't handle her right now. She's been saying that everyone is calling me a gold digger and that I will "forever be seen as the enemy to his family if I go through with this". I receive word documents (!!!) with *warnings* and *concerns* because the character limit on messages gets her. It's exhausting and draining. 

She flew over after we announced the engagement and grimaced at my ring. She left our apartment in a fit of tears, speaking Portuguese. I only understood "son" and "life" and "wrong" a lot. My portuguese is a work-in-progress. 

My fiance has been ignoring her messages lately too. They're really too much to handle. I told him he should suggest to her being more pleasant to talk to and stopping with the "lists of problems", as she has been going crazy about us not talking to her. 

So I call my mom and she said "I heard that Monica is coming over this week!" 

what. 

She SURPRISE booked a flight and came over on Easter. She didn't plan to stay with us but she IS staying at the hotel literally across the street from our apartment complex. 

You guys, I am so sick. I have this nasty virus thing, it's knocked me out cold for all of April. I've been in bed, sleeping. Fever, nasty cough, congestion, aches, headache -- the full blown flu. I am getting deferred grades this semester for my "significant and prolonged illness" - Dr. A. 

She's really mad I won't see her. She's saying it's so rude and is surprised my fiance supports it. She's certain my sickness is exaggerated to avoid seeing her. WTF DUDE! I feel like death! You don't want to catch what I've got! Ugh. 

The first summer I visited them in Portugal, I got so sick that I needed to go to the ER twice. She still talks about that like it's a good reason for his family to not like me. 

She's one of those people that believes everything online. She's always sharing the stupidest articles with those clickbate titles ("10 Foods in Your House that are Silently Killing You!"; "Shocking New Evidence! You'll Never Get a Vaccine Again!").

Last night, she shared "The Right Age to Get Married". Zero likes. God help me. 

edit: typos that were bothering me and my portuguese fluency-level haha

	<TEXT> She is not her disorder, but her disorder is life-threatening and she is at the maximum level of intervention, so it is very important to be precise and intentional in my interactions with her. She is very sick and her decision making is compromised. It's not that I am not treating her like a human being, I love her and I want her to live.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have any way to directly contact her therapist. Should I try to contact her mother? I assume her mother would have a means of talking to the therapist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get what you're saying -- there is a clarity issue on my end. When I say "I left it up to her to initiate contact" I mean that I included that in my message to her. 

It was something like "Hey Carly, I am so sorry to hear that my message the other day upset you. The last thing I want is to make your recovery more difficult. With that said, if you need to go without talking to me for a while, I want you to know that I understand that it is not personal and is only temporary. I care very much about you 3 I will leave it up to you to message or call first."

she thanked me and said she'd let me know </TEXT>
