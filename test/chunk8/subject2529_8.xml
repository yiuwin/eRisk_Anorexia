	<TEXT> You can move past it by losing weight. He's being honest with you and you can't expect him to feign attraction. The more you gain, the less he'll want to be with you. Be thankful that he's being honest now instead of when the damage is too much. It won't be that hard to get back to a healthy weight, and you'll feel better, have much better sex, and then you can go on workout dates with him. This comment isn't meant to offend you, rather to be honest.
