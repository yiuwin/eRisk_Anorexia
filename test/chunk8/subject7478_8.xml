Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr. Duterte hold talks in Beijing on Oct. 20 which culminate in the signing of a raft of commercial agreements.

At university in Manila, he studied politics under Jose Maria Sison, who later founded the Communist Party of the Philippines and in 1969 launched an armed insurrection. Mr. Sison, now in exile in the Netherlands, says he schooled Mr. Duterte in what he viewed as the evils of American imperialism and the corrupt nexus of business and political families who have ruled the Philippines at the expense of ordinary Filipinosa system Mr. Duterte has pledged to upend.

The Philippine communist party is listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. Mr. Duterte has said he sympathizes with the party, which he never joined.

His views on law and order coalesced in the 1980s when violent criminal gangs terrorized Davao City. Mr. Duterte was robbed at gunpoint, leading him to swear to destroy the gang responsible and others such as them, says Leo Villareal, who worked with Mr. Duterte at Davao City Hall.

Mr. Duterte worked through the mid-1980s as a city prosecutor, having surprised his family by finishing law school, his sister says. The country was descending into chaos, ruled by U.S.-backed strongman Ferdinand Marcos.

After a People Power revolution ousted Mr. Marcos in 1986, the criminal-justice system deteriorated, with wealthy Filipinos often escaping prosecution through bribes while other cases could drag on for years. Mr. Duterte came to see the legal process as something that can be delayed or derailed, Mr. Dureza says, with direct action the only way to effect change.

Elected mayor of Davao City in 1988, he adopted a strict approach that his sister, Ms. Duterte, says was modeled on Singapores disciplinarian leader, the late Lee Kuan Yew. He imposed curfews, and smoking and drinking restrictions.

He declared a crackdown on suspected drug dealers, and vigilante death squads in Davao killed more than 1,400 alleged criminals, according to Human Rights Watch and other rights groups. Mr. Duterte has said in speeches and interviews he encouraged police to be tough and shoot anyone resisting arrest but never personally ordered murders.
The Punisher

His measures were popular, and locals gave him the nickname The Punisher. He served seven terms, with interruptions for term limits, until 2016.

Along the way, Mr. Duterte nursed grievances over perceived U.S. slights, including a 2002 incident in which an American slipped out of the country under mysterious circumstances after a bomb exploded in his Davao City hotel room. Mr. Duterte suspected a CIA plot and brooded over the episode for years, friends say.

The U.S. embassy in Manila says: We took no action beyond providing routine consular services assisting a U.S. citizen with a medical evacuation. As services were rendered, we consulted closely with Philippine authorities.

Soon after the 2002 incident, the U.S. denied Mr. Duterte a visa, and his partner, a nurse, had her U.S. work visa canceled, say a friend and an associate of Mr. Dutertes who are familiar with the incidents and attribute the moves to U.S. concerns about extrajudicial killings in Davao City. The U.S. embassy in Manila declined to comment on the matter.

From 2002, the U.S. military was providing counterterrorism support in parts of Mindanao at Manilas request to help subdue Muslim separatists. In 2007, the government suggested holding an annual joint U.S.-Philippine exercise in Davao.

That provoked Mr. Duterte, who persuaded the Davao City council to pass a resolution permanently preventing American forces from exercising in the area. I dont want American soldiers in my city, he told the council, local media reported. Because of their arrogance and pretended superiority, the Americans invaded Iraq to kill Saddam Hussein but ended up destroying the country. We dont want that to happen to us.

Mr. Duterte initially refused supporters entreaties to run for president. He reversed course last November because he said he couldnt stomach the idea that then-poll leader Grace Poe, who held American citizenship until 2012, might win.

His victory in Mays election came after he promised to wipe out crime and spread the benefits of a fast-growing economy more evenly. Its going to be bloody, he predicted during a January interview with the Journal. People will die.

Mr. Duterte is popular at home, with 76% of Filipinos saying in a poll this month by Social Weather Stations, a research group, that they are satisfied with his work.

His presidential campaign featured only mild criticism of the U.S. That changed after he took office and faced foreign criticism.

At the Laos summit, he lashed out at Mr. Obama for alleged American war crimes over a century ago, holding up a photo of slain Filipinos and describing them as his own ancestors, says a person who was there.

Some of Mr. Dutertes colleagues say they are caught off-guard by his outbursts, in which he departs from prepared remarks.

We can only write the speeches, says one communications official, we cant make him read them.

Philippines president, driven by a sense of grievance over colonial history and perceived slights, threatens to undo a vital American relationship in Asia
By Trefor Moss

In an effort to clear tension with Barack Obama, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte approached him during a dinner at a regional summit in Laos last month, two days after he had openly criticized the U.S. president.

It made things worse. Mr. Duterte didnt feel Mr. Obama treated him as an equal in the encounter, says a Philippine official present, because Mr. Obama said a follow-up would come from White House staff, not himself. The next day, Mr. Duterte boycotted a group meeting with Mr. Obama and Southeast Asian leaders.

Mr. Duterte expected more respect from Obama, says his sister Jocellyn Duterte. White House officials say they cant confirm the wording of the exchange, saying it consisted of a handshake and pleasantries.

The perceived Laos snub fits into a lifetime of resentment toward America and what Mr. Duterte sees as U.S. arrogance toward the Philippines, interviews with his friends, family and associates showa sense of grievance that threatens to undo a vital American relationship in Asia.

If Mr. Dutertes sentiments werent yet clear to the world, he spelled them out Thursday in Beijings Great Hall of the People during a state visit. In a speech discussing military and economic ties, he declared: In this venue I announce my separation from the United States. He said Americans are loud, sometimes rowdy, then launched into a crude imitation of American speech, which he said is not adjusted to civility.

A look at the 71-year-old Philippine leaders life, and how it informs his thinking, helps explain why Washington might not be able to salvage what was until recently one of its closest Asian alliances.

Mr. Dutertes bitterness was instilled early by his upbringing on an island where locals still resent U.S. military actions of over a century ago and Americas subsequent colonial rule, and it was stoked by incidents later in life that he saw as trappings of U.S. imperialism.

He grew up a brawler, once coming home with a knife-fight wound. He made his political name as a crime-fighting mayor under whose regime hundreds in his city died at the hands of vigilantes.

That tough approach foreshadowed his first hundred days as president, during which he declared an assault on drug dealers. Police say they have shot dead about 1,600 suspected drug dealers who resisted arrest, that about 700 more have fallen victim to vigilante killings and that over 1,000 other deaths are being investigated to see if they are drug-related.

When you pick a fight with him, he will not let it passhe will deal with you, says Jesus Dureza, a former classmate who serves in the Duterte cabinet. This is very deep in him.

His anti-U.S. rhetoric flared last month when he declared Mr. Obama shouldnt lecture him on human rights. In an aside directed at no one, he used an exclamation of frustration meaning son of a whore, which some in the international press interpreted as a dig at the U.S. president. Mr. Obama then canceled plans for a one-on-one meeting with him at the regional summit in Laos. It was two days later that Mr. Duterte approach Mr. Obama there.

In recent weeks, Mr. Duterte has canceled U.S.-Philippine military exercises. He said he might annul a 2014 U.S.-Philippines defense pact, a key aspect of Mr. Obamas Asian pivot, that lets the U.S. deploy soldiers to Philippine bases. And he has threatened to cross the Rubicon and ditch the countries 65-year-old treaty in favor of accords with Russia and China.

In Beijing, he signed business deals with President Xi Jinping, who promised the Philippines over $9 billion in loans in return for Mr. Dutertes agreement to restart bilateral talks.

Ive realigned myself in your ideological flow, Mr. Duterte said in the Beijing speech, and maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the worldChina, Philippines and Russia.

Souring relations could leave the U.S. with fewer options for expanding its military presence in the South China Seaa resource-rich and strategically important area claimed almost entirely by China, and in part by several Southeast Asian statesand make it harder to portray itself as a guarantor of regional security, as it has done since World War II.

Before Mr. Dutertes talk of separation, U.S. defense officials said the relationship continued to function. Afterward, a State Department spokesman called his comments inexplicably at odds with the bilateral relationship, which officials including the president have described as ironclad."

Many defense analysts in the U.S. and the Philippines say unresolved South China Sea disputes could still force Mr. Duterte back into Washingtons arms. Beijing controls a contested reef, Scarborough Shoal, about 125 miles off the Philippine coast, that it took over in 2012.

Philippine defense officials have said publicly they are largely in the dark about Mr. Dutertes plans. They nonetheless make clear he intends to forge a more independent foreign policy than his predecessor, Benigno Aquino III.

Mr. Duterte is trying to liberate us from a shackling dependency on America, wrote Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. in a Facebook post this month. Filipinos are treated as little brown brothers of the U.S., he wrote. Mr. Yasay didnt respond to inquiries.

Mr. Dutertes office didnt respond to requests for comment for this article. Publicly, he has faulted Washington for failing to halt Chinas territorial grabs and for refusing to give explicit guarantees it would protect all Philippine territory, including remote possessions in the South China Sea.

Mr. Dutertes nationalism, displayed in his angry reaction to Mr. Obamas admonishments, echoes sentiments common among left-leaning Filipinos that America never atoned for invading the archipelago in 1898 and violently subduing the former Spanish colony. With independence in 1946, the Philippines passed into the hands of what many left-leaning politicians such as Mr. Duterte regarded as a corrupt Manila elite installed by Washington.
Historys scars

The son of a provincial governor on Mindanao, Mr. Duterte grew up in a troubled region with ample cause to resent both Manila and Washington. A largely Muslim area in an overwhelmingly Catholic nation, it was never fully conquered by Spain. When the U.S. took over, Mindanaos sultanates put up stiff resistance.

For Mindanaons, the colonial experience left scars and a hatred of perceived oppression and disrespect, says Ms. Duterte, the presidents sister, who lives in Davao City, Mindanaos largest. She says their grandmother, a Muslim, helped Mr. Duterte come to believe that Washington was guilty of crimes during its invasion and colonization.

He was a rebel from the start, say friends and family. As a boy, he was expelled from his strait-laced Jesuit school for squirting blue ink on a priest, recalls Mr. Dureza. At high school he was a brawler. He always had that hair-trigger temper, says Carlos Dominguez III, a childhood friend and now Mr. Dutertes finance secretary.

He staggered into the family home one night, clutching a stab wound from a street fight, his sister says. He later shot a college classmate in the leg in reprisal for an attack on a friend, Mr. Dureza says, noting that the other man recovered and Mr. Duterte faced no legal blowback.

Roots of Resentment

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was born under American colonial rule and now talks of severing the Philippines' economic and military ties with Washington.

	<TEXT>  I was asked to be a moderator by the community and initially resisted the position. I am just doing what I always said I wanted to see here: cut down spam and junk and get focused. 

Caerbannog, I just want you to know that myself and a lot of people here appreciate your modding efforts.

Ideally, these wikileaks/podesta/"Sekret Machines" people would create their own sub (r/ufoconspiracy) or just go to r/conspiracy.

If that isn't an option, it's better to create a megathread, [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/56tqqq/polling_megathread_week_of_october_9_2016/), where they can spam their stories without cluttering the rest of this subreddit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I guess it depends on your definition of "modern times".

I'd say 1628 could be one of the contenders.

Here is a fantastic article on it: http://russhaywood.com/2011/08/one-odd-night-in-alaska-jal-1628-a-synthesis-of-narratives/

I'll consider all options for the 1628 UFO sighting: pilots were drugged, pilots are lying, they saw an unknown natural phenomena, military was conducting experimental balloon/flight/aviation test, military was conducting holographic weapons test, etc...

But I also think it's one of the best contenders for non-human tech. Maybe....

I don't know a great deal about the RB-47 case.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   both the co pilot and engineer who were there in the same cockpit didn't report seeing anything

They *did* see stuff.

Here is an interview with Copilot Tamefuji (PDF): http://russhaywood.com/wp-haywood/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tamefuji-Interview-JAL-1628.pdf

And the interview with flight engineer Yoshio Tsukuba: http://russhaywood.com/wp-haywood/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tsukuba-Interview-JAL-1628.pdf

 the Captain had a history of reporting ufo's

I've read the reports that Terauchi was a "repeater", but I take things on a case-by-case basis. It does make me wonder if he did embellish his case, but it doesn't destroy the case. </TEXT>

I'm not exactly sure why they got cancelled, but that doesn't seem like a valid reason. 

Probably something to do with costs/ratings. Or as blukami said, some personnel issues. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Two worthwhile episodes of 'UFO Hunters' that re-aired recently </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-22 19:53:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wouldn't usually recommend 'UFO Hunters' because, from what I remember, the show's standards were....a bit lax. 

Frankly, I think it's a good rule-of-thumb to be *very* skeptical of anything Bill Birnes (cohost of the show) says.

I DVR'd a couple of episodes recently, got around to watching them, and found them to be worthwhile.

The first episode is "Code Red": http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1b92ui_ufo-hunters-code-red-aliens-extraterrestrial-paranormal-documentary_tv

It deals with a solid UFO case, the 1965 Edwards Air Force Base UFO Incident.

Case background: http://www.nicap.org/edwards65dir.htm

This episode of the show was able to get a primary witness, Chuck Sorrells, to take them through the happenings of that night/event. The only other in-depth interview that Sorrells seems to have done is this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUIsCOPXGBQ

The second episode is "Giant UFOs": http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x19q9tb_giant-ufos-ufo-hunters-aliens-extraterrestrial-paranormal-documentary_tv

It deals primarily with the 2007 Alderney sighting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Alderney_UFO_sighting

The show was able to get pilot [Ray Bowyer](https://youtu.be/mUsuwwO2_sM) to take them through the happenings of that night. 

These two sightings are credible, and not very easy to debunk or dismiss. And the latter occurred in 2007, so it's (relatively) one of the more recent, "serious" sightings.

The best thing about these two docs is how involved the two primary witnesses (Sorrells   Bowyer) were throughout the episodes. 

Though many in the UFO field know of these two sightings, maybe you haven't seen these two documentaries. If you haven't, they may be worth your time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The show excelled in the more serious moments and scenes between Riggs and Murtaugh.

The actors are very different from Gibson and Glover but I thought they were fine.

You can't replicate the magic of the Lethal Weapon films, but the show was alright. 

I'll watch the next episode. The show has some promise. </TEXT>

 Rak also said during the August 31 interview that he and other members of the group had used recreational drugs on the night of the alleged abduction. I remember Jack brought some Afghan temple ball with him to share with the rest of us, he said. Yeah, we were definitely stoned when we went out on the lake just before we got that sighting. According to Rak, he felt conflicted when others asked him whether the group had been under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the night of the encounters. I remember being on The Joan Rivers Show. Joan was asking, Were you guys drinking or taking drugs? Fortunately, I was sitting furthest away from her. Jim (Weiner) was right next to her and he had to field that question and lie and I didnt have to lie. </TEXT>

The media-driven hysteria plays right into the terrorists hands: "Terrorists have learned they do not need to replicate Armageddon to cripple the West. They need only rely on the Pavlovian reaction of the press and politicians to turn sordid petty crimes into atrocities, the actions of a few fanatics into a clash of civilizations. 

The bad guys today do not need to spend half a million dollars organizing an attack like the one a decade and a half ago, they only need to buy a few guns and take a few shots, or they simply rent a truck and turn it into a killing machine." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I believe the Illinois sighting was simply an advertising blimp in transit

I think I've read some reports/articles that say the same things, ie. the UFO sightings were following known blimp routes.

But the witness testimony describes the UFOs doing things (speed) that blimps can't do. 

I know witness testimony is never concrete proof but the work Darryl Barker/David Marler did relatively quickly after the sighting makes me think this case isn't cut   dry explained.  

 where the two other gentlemen in the cockpit tell a different story than Terauchi

I agree none did describe the *exact* same thing, but it seems they do admit to a UFO encounter.

Here is the interview with [Copilot Tamefuji (PDF)](http://russhaywood.com/wp-haywood/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tamefuji-Interview-JAL-1628.pdf).

And the interview with flight engineer [Yoshio Tsukuba (PDF)](http://russhaywood.com/wp-haywood/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tsukuba-Interview-JAL-1628.pdf).

A fantastic article about the JAL 1628 incident: http://russhaywood.com/2011/08/one-odd-night-in-alaska-jal-1628-a-synthesis-of-narratives/

If you google "site:russhaywood.com 1628" you'll get more sources/interviews/etc regarding the case.

  Terauchi had a history of reporting uncorroborated encounters

I've read the reports that Terauchi was a "repeater", but I take things on a case-by-case basis. It does make me wonder if he did embellish his case, but it doesn't destroy the case.

  Father Gill/Papua New Guinea sighting

I know *of* the case, but haven't looked very much into it.

 Gordon Cooper/Edward's AFB landing and take-off of a "UFO" HERE

This is an interesting one. I like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsEd_b1C8DY) interview of his as well.

 But again, we just don't have that smoking gun evidence to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt 

I agree. And unfortunately the more you usually look into a UFO case, the less factual the "evidence" becomes.

 that ET craft have been visiting Earth.

But what makes me even more curious are options (speculation) other than ET for theoretical non-human tech UFOs. (Time travelers, AI robots from an earlier earth civilization, etc) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the Trindade Island UFO photo as well as the Petit-Rechain triangular UFO photo were found to be hoaxes (unfortunately, I think both were featured in Leslie Kean's popular book).

Though the Petit-Rechain photo hoax is just a singular event, it doesn't explain the entire Belgian wave.

I think in the book Mirage Men, the 1952 UFOs over the White House was said to be a psy-op/hoax perpetrated by the Military.

Note: Two books that show that *some* UFOs are military tests "dressed up" as ETs are "Mirage Men" by Pilkington and "The Greys Have Been Framed" by Jack Brewer.

I've been looking at Rendlesham with wary eyes after the Binary Code stuff by Penniston. 

I think most, if not all: abduction, cattle mutilation, crop circle cases are BS or explained by prosaic origins.

The exopolitics/offworld civilization stuff by Dolan is BS.

I appreciate all the [interviews](https://www.youtube.com/user/csetiweb/videos) conducted by Greer, but I don't waste my time with his stuff.

Majestic 12 was a fraud. Same with Bob Lazar. Same with Ed Walters/Gulf Breeze.

There are some compelling cases in UFO history, but it gets tiresome cutting through the BS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If his description of the discs is accurate, it's almost impossible to guess what they really were. For all intents and purposes, they very well could have been extraterrestrial. But as of now, that simply can't be proven. These kinds of encounters keep me sitting on the fence as a UFO/ET agnostic. 

I'd say the classic cases of Coyne and Japan 1628 keep me interested. 

More "recently" the [2000 Southern Illinois case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6XOw1vITGU)

And that kind of is the problem; the truly intriguing (and **well documented**) cases are few and far between.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciate you putting up the good (evidence/logic based) fight.

Yours is the sanest post here.

  Nobody should be flat-out claiming it must be an alien craft of some sort, as that is likely the very last thing it probably is.

It's unfortunate that you even have to say this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does look like a flying saucer, but then again that could just be pareidolia. Like with [helicopter hieroglyphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_hieroglyphs).

If theoretically some UFOs are non-human tech, then maybe they have been around for a while (centuries, millennia).

Or it could just be the artist's rendition of a shield. Who knows.

Maybe asking an art historian could shed some insight into why artists would draw such things, or what they were meant to represent (if anything). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> List of some good writers/researchers: 

Kevin Randle, Richard Hastings, Richard Haines, Curt Collings, Jack Brewer, John Greenewald, Paul Dean, David Marler, Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, Mark Pilkington, Bruce Maccabbe (partially, duped by Gulf Breeze/Ed Walters), Leslie Kean, John Alexander, Keith Basterfield.

They aren't true believers, they don't overreach with their claims, and they take an evidence based approach. </TEXT>
