	<TEXT> This is good. I wonder how the Twitch community will take this the way they did with Bob Ross - that stuff was fun.

Did they do this with Reading Rainbow yet? It would be pretty cool too if they did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember when I started the show during that hiatus... And waiting ages for the In Too Deep story to air after I finished. Good thing I discovered other things thanks to it to keep me company through time.

I also vividly remember the time when those Super Watermelon Island and Barn Mates clips leaked. Good times! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, sir. That will definitely work for me.

And now you just game me an odd thirst for some green tea. Thanks for that, too. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I want to check this series out.... Am I doing it right, or is there an utterly agreed-upon order? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So, this franchise/series sounds super special amazing and I'd like to start it out sometime, so I set me this order:

Fate 06 (I'm sorry, but I just have it here to get a basic idea of enjoyment), UBW, VN (if I can't wait long enough for Heaven's Feel), and finally Fate/Zero.

Does this seem good enough for a newbie fan like me, or is there a totally agreed on series order that has to be followed? I really appreciate all the stuff put into this series and its fans, so I hate to be a total idiot but let me know what there is to be done for first-timers. All of this can be very complicated, hearing different orders left and right.

(BTW: I know Fate 06 is supposed to suck, but I'm still going to watch it just to get a decent idea as to what I'm gonna be in for, and to look forward all the more to the better adaptations that improve upon the series' concept.) </TEXT>
