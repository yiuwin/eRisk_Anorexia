Pray for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suffer from Crohn's, and for those who don't know about it, it's a really nasty disease that most people certainly *do not* want to talk about. I've been hospitalized three times, and have to inject myself every other week to treat it. If you're going to make something up, I'd suggest going with IBS over Crohn's or Colitis because IBS is a syndrome, not a disease. It has similar symptoms to the two (loss of appetite, nausea, stomach pain) but is not as severe and therefore easier to fudge. </TEXT>

Usually the start of my period coincides with a downward spiral in my level of control. This is the first time in MONTHS where my progress wasn't completely thrown off by my appetite. I hope I'm not jinxing myself but... I don't feel ravenous?  </TEXT>
