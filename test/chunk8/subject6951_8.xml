	<TEXT> They are unlikely to accept you if you don't meet your conditional. However, I think that you'll still get a chance to get into uni in the UK. I think that once everyone is admitted, universities get to pick students they want to have but haven't met their conditional for another uni. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was at a french school before taking the IB program and I got to learn spanish and latin pretty well there, I was almost fluent so it helped me a lot for my IB transition. When went into IB, something that annoyed me was that they were mixing SL and HL classes BOTH years. I don't think that it was the ideal working environment but it still turned out pretty well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For Spanish we started reviewing after the orals. For English L L we didn't have much review other than looking over the books the last few classes. For math, we were done 2 months early so we did a lot of review. For Econ we were done 2.5 months early, we all did individual presentations covering all subjects. For Physics we had review classes on the week-ends 1 month prior to the exam yet we didnt have time to cover the whole syllabus. 

edit: also we had mock exams 1 month before the actual exam, does that count? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If she got conditional acceptances in the UK and she doesn't meet them, I think there's another round after all accepted candidates are admitted where any universities (in the UK) gets to chose candidates that didn't meet their conditional acceptances. I might be wrong but this is what I've heard. She shouldn't really be worried anyways, worse case scenario she doesn't get accepted anywhere, decides to take a gap year and either re-apply with lower score conditions or apply in a country that doesn't really look at IB grades (like Canada). If you want to know anything else, ask away. I have quite a bit of free time now. </TEXT>
