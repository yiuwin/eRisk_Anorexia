	<TEXT> This is how I feel as well. I loved joining random 1 to 3 day tournaments and trying all sorts of decks. The 4 to 30 card reward was always an afterthought. Now I'm spending 10 gems for challenges and I end up facing very skilled players who dominate any deck I'm trying to test out. I end up resorting to my go to decks to be successful which defeats the purpose for testing out decks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously. But you're still missing my point. Take my deck for example, it has log and stab gobs, no zap, nothing cheaper than a mini p. If for instance my gabs are out of rotation and sparky is a couple tower arrows from death, what's the logical play? Sacrifice my 4 elixir mini p or toss a log to push it back and finish it off with 1 more tower arrows. Both plays negate the shot, only 1 is the right choice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I'm a bit biased since those are the two I use the most. I run a beatdown deck where I spend the first 2 mins defending with knight, gobs, IW, log and fire spirits. I find the log indispensable in most defense situations. I use it in a rocket deck as well where I ended up hitting barbs and a valk with the log knocking them back into a witch while my rocket was coming at her. Knocking a miner off an EC and making him retarget the king tower is also fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The trick with tank and 3M beatdown is to bring cheap cards that you can defend well with and minimize damage while you prepare to push. For me, knight, gobs, fire spirits, ice wizard and log are all I use for the first 2 mins unless I get 2 pumps down. If you defend well you gain a huge advantage. Obviously if I see an RG, giant or golem, 3M are deployed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ever think that maybe you just don't belong in this trophy range with those cards levels? Sure you may have more skill, but currently your cards don't match up so it's an uphill struggle. Since you're stuck in A8, drop down to 2300-2400 range and chill there until your cards are adequate level.

It's no different for me in A9. I stay at 3100 on purpose because I'll just run into level 12s and 13s if I push up to 3400 - 3600 What's the point then? I've tested my deck and skill, I know I can climb up, but I can't sustain it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been sitting in legendary for a while and I've bought all the cards for this deck (except LJ). I'll be buying LJ once I save up the gold again. Of course he has to appear in the shop as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been trying to find a viable deck for both tourney and 3000+ ladder play that uses the rocket well. I can get it to level 9 because an SMC and magical chest shat out a bunch of cards for it. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you considered the dark Prince over the Prince? I realize the Prince is your main win condition, but a raged DP is something fierce. You also save 1 elixir and have ground AOE to deal with barbs. I run something a bit similar to your main deck, but with DP instead of LJ(don't have him) and furnace instead of EC. I realize you've been dominating with your deck, but curious to know if DP could get it done just as well, if not better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off I'm well aware about the f2p circle jerk, secondly I don't need to toot my own horn about being f2p. It means fuck all at this stage of the game. I dropped that comment in at the end to let any would be reader know that I'm not part of the whale community. My comment is from a free players perspective. I didn't come on here stating that I'm in arena whatever at some bogus trophy level. No one gives a shit about those statements anymore. But thanks for the advice anyways. </TEXT>

You'll find a significant majority of the player base will agree with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guess we'll wait and see if and what supercell decides to do. This has been brought up many, many times and no solution has been provided. Makes you think they don't care about the whales since they've bagged all that cash already. Anyways, to there lower class it just looks like a bunch of spoiled rich kids whining about the rich kid down the street cheating his way through life.

P.S I'm f2p, just thought I should put that out there again /s </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Time and time again this comes up. But what does it matter in the end? It's currently just bragging rights. It has no effect on 99% of the player base. Ladder rankings and fighting amongst the whales means fuck all. Tournaments and an even playing field for the entire player base is what does and will matter. IMO competitions like the Super Magical Cup are the best parts of this game and reading the summaries of the competition/watching the highlight are great.

But I'm a nobody f2p player. This is just my lowly opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really sure what's up. I can't really offer anything other than I'm on the latest build with no battery drain. I'm fact my battery is noticeably better. All the same apps I had installed on MM are running as well. Phone actually feels smoother too. On MM was getting some serious hang ups after doing a bit of clash Royale gaming. Nothing so far on N.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sit at 3100 on purpose. I'll play and win a game, then start another match and quit out giving my opponent a 3 crown. I do this after every win, pretty sure I've provided a crap ton of 3 crowns to struggling players. There's no real incentive to push any higher for me. </TEXT>
