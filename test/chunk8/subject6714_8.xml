	<TEXT> Back in the late 90s I had a job that paid extremely well, but was also very demanding. There was a few months when I had to put 60-70 hours a week (overtime was paid in full compliance with the law at the time in Argentina). As you can imagine, that didn't leave me with much free time. So instead of going to a club and spend Jove knows how much time and money trying to chat someone up, I would call a classy escort and have a nice, sexy time with a beautiful woman. </TEXT>

That's the point I wanted to make. To many people, even smart people, science looks scary (see all the bollocks about WiFi being dangerous), and that is fertile ground for opportunist that want to sell you a "natural" (or some other equivalent) alternative to all that science. In addition, drug companies, etc. do have a record of being dishonest and corrupt, which feeds the fear and gives argument to the snake-oil salesmen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To me, hands down and by a long shot: "Djala Morir Adentro".

To understand why, let me tell you a story:

The film's original title is [Julie Darling](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084182/), a rather forgotten German film from 1983. But it would be in 1986 that the film made it to cinemas in Argentina, where it became famous for its Spanish title, Djala Morir Adentro - Let It Die Inside, which has a massive sexual innuendo. 

It was promoted with [posters of this kind](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zZtcJw1ElMo/TjOzcpjtuxI/AAAAAAAAABQ/aGu6weLWf4M/s400/D%25C3%25A9jala+morir+adentro.jpg) as a controversial erotic thriller (the poster even mentions it was "uncut" or "uncensored". It was still a time of sexual awakening in Argentina (Democracy had been restored in late 1983, after 7 years of a brutal military dictatorship, the culmination of decades of political instability, violence and repression), with softcore films getting more or less wide release, and commercial success, such as [Chained Heat](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085318/), featuring Linda Blair and Sybil Danning (who happened to play one of the main characters in Julie Darling). It was a massive hit and it made its distributor (another quite interesting character) a lot of money, and, I assume, disappointed not few horny males. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  One path has apps and iPhone style smartphones never taking off.

I'm not so sure about that. Smartphones already existed before the iPhone that were used by people that were not necessarily tech-savvy. They were bigger and not so powerful, for sure, but they had many of the features we can see in modern smartphones. The development may have been a bit slower than in OTL, but sooner or later it would have caught up with what we have today. The question is what the app and OS market would look like. </TEXT>

In any case, the pdf I link above, a joint statement by FAO and WHO *"concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet."* </TEXT>

No, they haven't. In fact they've stated [quite the opposite](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/jmprsummary2016.pdf)(pdf). There are other things in this article that tickle my skeptic senses. But I'd rather wait for a more qualified opinion before giving mine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a friend who was invariably late for meetings, sometimes by half an hour. It was annoying (this was 25 years ago, BTW, so you had to wait for him at the agreed meeting point). There was this time that we needed him to be punctual, so we told him the meeting time was half hour earlier than the one agreed. That was the first time he didn't come late. He was not amused, but he learnt his lesson.

EDIT: Just to make it clear. When I say it was the first time he didn't come late, I meant that got there at the time we told him to be there (or so he claimed), and had to wait for us until we started arriving. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm translating a book and the term "Morphic Resonance" appeared almost at the beginning without much of an explanation other than that it is *"the effect of like on like beyond space and time  similar things (beings) mutually resonate on the basis of similar structures or patterns, especially vibrational patterns of activity"*

I have never heard of it before. A Google search produced quite a bit. I avoided the author's official page, and, among others, clicked on the one I linked, published [in Pseudoskeptiks Revealed](http://www.skepticalaboutskeptics.org/).

I've also found [this comment on the theory](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/04/morphic-paranormal-science-sheldrake), which is a lot less supportive, to say the least. The author, BTW, seems quite interesting.

Anyway, I'm not saying I accept or believe in Morphic Resonance, at least not as proof of telepathy or some other paranormal phenomena. I wanted to know your thoughts on the criticism delivered in the linked article. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once was reading a fairy-tale to my daughter in the sofa. The dog was sleeping next to her. At some point, one of the characters says "let's go for a walk". After I finished uttering those words, the dog sprang up and begun to jump all over me and my daughter. Needless to say, I had to put down the book and get the leash.

I work from home, and when the weather is nice, I like going to the local pub to wrap the day up. The dog loves coming with me, and she goes crazy just by seeing me (or even hearing me) putting on a shirt or taking money out of the wallet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. I don't. As a reader, I find most written reviews boring. Many seem to be written by people who try to extract as many flavour notes as possible, to the point that I believe that much of it is bullshit (maybe unintended, but bullshit nonetheless). And the few video reviews that I've seen are even worse, and I certainly can't be arsed with podcasts.

The few beer reviewers that I follow are people whose tastes I already know, and who either know to write or live here in the Czechia and I'm more likely to come across the beers they talk about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bit of background; I'm translating a book that, according to its author, is largely influenced by Brunton's philosophy (Oriental Mentalism, I think it's called). The Wikipedia page doesn't say much about it, and the only thing I've been able to find after a quick search were Brunton's own writings, which I don't have the time to read (and tbh, what little I've read was bit too new-agey for my taste). 

So, I'm looking for reviews or critical readings of his stuff, and I would of course appreciate any comments anyone may have on the subject. Thanks in advance </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Call it different ways of seeing the same thing. 

To me, they service providers. They are people whom I pay (directly or indirectly) to do something that I'm not capable of doing, or prefer not to do at the moment. In short, they are making my life easier, at least for the duration of the interaction. So, regardless of the power dynamics, I don't think they are beneath me, because, if it wasn't for them, I would have to perhaps do that thing myself.

Which brings me to the power dynamics. I don't think it is that clear-cut, and they will depend on a lot of factors. I'm the one paying so it may look that I'm calling the shots, but the truth that the person providing me the service can very easily ruin my day, and may even get away with it, depending on the circumstances.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beer production was also affected by the world wars, with taxes being hiked and breweries being forced to make much weaker beers because of rationing. 

Beer historian Ron Pattinson has conducted extensive research on the topic, and he runs an excellent, though quite idiosyncratic, blog. You can look at the work he has done regarding [WW I](http://barclayperkins.blogspot.cz/search/label/WW%20I) and [WW II](http://barclayperkins.blogspot.cz/search/label/WW%20I), but be prepared, it gets really technical with brewing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Other than what /u/BorisCJ mentions, it would have resulted in a lot more hassle than it was probably worth. It would have been really hard, and next to impossible, to give him a fair trial. Would any of the evidence the US govt. supposedly had have been admissible in a court of law? Would it have been possible to put together an unbiased jury? 

The defense, naturally, would have taken advantage of the difficulties of the case to muddle the waters as much as humanly possible, while Bin Laden himself, could have used the trial as a pulpit.

All that, of course, provided they would have had the intention of giving him a fair trial, to begin with, and not try him in a kangaroo court of some sorts (which would have generated another set of problems). </TEXT>

Besides, one thing is service, and another thing is servitude. A server is not a servant, is someone who's providing me with a service and I treat them as equals. </TEXT>

I really don't care whether someone who's providing me a service smiles at me or not, as long as they're doing their job well. And it makes me appreciate more the honest smile you get from time to time.

Source: I live in the Czech Rep., where many people (incl. waiters) seem to have been born with a limited number of smiles for their whole lives, and choose to use them wisely. Unfortunately, the fake-smile culture is slowly gaining ground. </TEXT>

I don't see the banks as deciding who gets to run for president. It is evident Le Pen is running for president. They are only choosing not to finance her campaign, and it seems to be their legal right to do so. 

The best solution in the case would to not allow political parties to finance their campaigns with bank loans, so everybody would playing on a level field as far as that goes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has to do with democracy if the decision of the bank was motivated by a political influence.

It could be also said that the decision of the First Czech-Russian Bank to lend her money for her campaign was also motivated by political influence, and that the new bank simply disagrees with that. In any case, the article gives no details on the agreement Le Pen reached with the First Czech-Russian Bank back in 2014 (and I now know why she came to Prague back then). It could well be that the debt was in arrears or that she breached some contractual condition. 

In any case, I can understand why a bank would not want to lend her any money. She's running on a platform that goes against their best interests, why would they support it? 

Perhaps u/emwac is right when he says that banks should not be allowed to lend money to political parties for campaign purposes, but that's another question. </TEXT>

Firstly, many, if not most, people don't see beyond the "YES/NO" question. We would all want lower taxes, for sure. But what are the consequences of that? Few people will think of it.

Brexit is a good example of that. </TEXT>
