	<TEXT> Well, if religion is a man-made invention, then so is morality and both are irrelevant. It really depends what is meant by "morality" though. If the person in question means, as atheists often do when discussing morality, simply a mutually agreed-upon set of social rules that a community has decided upon for their own perceived benefit, then morality can certainly exist with no religion. It is also completely meaningless outside of its own contrived application and has no compelling force to anyone who doesn't feel like following it (and can get away with it). Basically the only reason to act morally (for whatever definition of moral is decided upon) is for one's own benefit. Also, there is no good standard on which to judge the morality of any one culture as opposed to any other. If "good" and "evil" are simply arbitrary distinctions imposed on people by the society in which they live, then different societies have different, equally valid conceptions of morality. This makes the whole idea of morality pretty useless.

Now, Catholics (as well as some other religions) appeal to a more objective notion of morality, whereby we approach an objective Good, which exists independent of humanity and does not depend on society or change based on culture. The application of the principles may change in different cultures, but the principles themselves are constant and ever-striving toward the objective Good. For Catholics, God is "The Good" and the goal towards which we must align ourselves in all our thoughts and actions.

The funny part is when people try to act as though secular humanism has some objective basis and should therefore be imposed on all, and all cultures must be judged by these modern standards. They act like we've made some breakthroughs in morality science and advanced in our culture, rather than simply changing our minds based on the popular zeitgeist and trading in old vices for new. As though those pesky savages of the past would have agreed with us on absolutely every moral front if only they had known what we know now. It's chronological snobbery at its finest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the case of a tubal pregnancy, it is still not permissible to directly abort the developing embryo, or blastocyst, or whatever stage it's in. It is permissible to remove the section of the tube on which the development is occurring, which will almost certainly kill the child since it has already implanted improperly. The fact that the final outcome produces the same result in terms of life and death makes the acts morally equivalent to modern eyes, which are steeped in utilitarian and consequentialist mindsets, but the distinction of intent and double effect is very important to Catholic morality. The action is not intended to kill but to heal, and that death may occur as a foreseen but unintended consequence is tragic, but it is permissible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Catholic morality clearly dictates that there are some actions which are intrinsically evil, despite individual conscience or circumstance. Killing an innocent (one example of which is direct abortion) is one of these things. No matter what "greater good" may come of it, it is never morally permissible to do evil. The life of any human, man or woman, is a precious and valuable thing. But a life cannot be preserved by murder, no matter what the odds of survival are one way or the other. It is never morally permissible to do evil that good may come of it. This has been the consistent teaching of the Church since the time of Jesus. Even if the whole world would be destroyed if you did not perform an abortion, and you were certain that every man, woman, and child would die if you did not commit murder, it would still be evil and still not be morally permissible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Removing a child that is already dead may be medically termed an abortion, but it isn't the same thing and the Catholic Church doesn't view it as such. Also, the amount of suffering caused or prevented by an action isn't necessarily a good indicator of its morality. We aren't utilitarians. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure as to the specific cases outlined here, but as /u/gnujack said, the USCCB allowed treatment in these cases. The difference is that the intent can never be to kill the child, so all methods involving a direct abortion are right out. If treatment is given knowing that a consequence of the treatment will almost 100% kill the child, it can still be done if the situation is grave. Just as long as the killing of the child was not the goal of the treatment, but only a known but unintended consequence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, there are 2000 years' worth of writings, teachings, law, philosophy, and theology behind the Church, so it's impossible to really get everything. I've heard that Catholicism for Dummies is actually a very good starting resource, despite its name. If you're feeling really adventurous, you could try tackling the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is hundreds of pages and thousands of paragraphs outlining what we believe and why, with references to Scripture and writings of Church leaders. I'd caution against asking actual Catholics you know, since the average Catholic isn't often well-informed about the faith (much the same way people can't typically tell you details about how their government works despite living in it their whole life). Good luck learning! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah bro, I prefer to keep the half of what Jesus said about being divine and serving God, and completely ignore anything about "helping" the slimy meat people that infect the world. I think that completely serving God alone and ignoring other people is the REAL message of Jesus, and the other stuff was all added later to make it more palatable to the masses because later followers felt bad and corrupted the message because of sentimentality. So I follow all the teachings of Jesus that relate to God, and cut out all those pesky non-supernatural parts that confuse the issue.

	<TEXT> Well, there is no official "Orthodox opinion" on this matter since they don't have a unified enough front to make decisions like this on an ecumenical level. Some Orthodox do recognize Catholic sacraments as valid, and others do not. For the ones that do not, it is largely a different understanding of the nature of the priesthood. For Catholics, once a priest has faculties, sacraments they perform will always be valid if performed correctly, though they may not be licit. In other words, they'll be breaking the rules, but the sacrament still happens. For many Orthodox, they understand the priests' faculties as only bearing fruit as a result of their union to the Church. So once you break away from the Orthodox, they would say that no sacraments performed are valid. That is the main distinction, and one I think is largely ignored when discussing unity between East and West. It's a pretty big difference in sacramental theology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My claim is that some people allow killings that others would define as murder. If you want to use "unlawful killing" as the definition of murder then it is logically impossible for murder to be legal. I was speaking of murder as "unjust killing", which I would say is legal in many cultures and supported by their beliefs. The beliefs of people constitute what the state defines as murder, so the law therefore chooses between different beliefs when identifying which circumstances constitute murder. There is no way to make laws while "respecting all beliefs". That's my point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well yes, if murder is defined as unjust killing, then different people who believe in different definitions of justice will have different ideas of what murder is. That's what I've been trying to say. I'm not sure how I can explain this better. Of course people are going to advocate for laws that reflect right and wrong according to their worldview, including their religion. Your worldview seems to be that all beliefs are equally valid, which is on its face contradictory. Catholics should advocate that the law reflect Catholic principles, and I'd imagine that Muslims would say that the law should reflect Islam, etc. Religion is the core of a person's belief about the universe and the role of humanity in it. This doesn't magically go away when entering the public square or the voting booth. I will vote based on my religion, since there is literally nothing else for me to base my decisions on that makes any sense. I actually believe that the tenets of the Catholic Church are true.

	<TEXT> There have been and continue to be many cultures that advocate honor killings and see them as justified. And many other cultures have said that certain people or groups do not have a right to property, or that members of higher classes can take from those in lower classes as they will. These are beliefs that were held by people, and some still hold them. 

To perhaps use more common differences, some people believe that all taxation is theft and that the government has no right to levy them. There are people who believe that welfare only encourages laziness and does not help anyone overall. Catholics believe that abortion is murder and that society is better when marriage is recognized as the union of one man and one woman for the purpose of having and raising children. Clearly laws must choose between beliefs when enacted. Otherwise there would be no need for the law at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Laws by their nature advocate for one set of beliefs over another. We pass laws against murder despite some people's beliefs that killing certain people is perfectly fine. We pass laws against stealing despite the fact that some people don't believe in personal property. Not all beliefs should be validated by the law, only true ones, and people have different ideas about which beliefs are true, so there will naturally be conflicts. People also disagree about what rights people have and where those rights come from. You still seem to think that the current set of laws respect all beliefs and rights, but we as Catholics would say they do not. We have fundamental disagreements on the nature of justice and the proper role of the state, so we are naturally going to advocate for different laws. Catholics are not alone in this regard, but you seem to be singling them out in your post because the beliefs we hold are not in line with the commonly-held zeitgeist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, a Catholic does not need to believe in Fatima, but it serves as a useful example for a modern miracle widely witnessed by many people of different faiths or no faith. Why hasn't God yet allowed a miracle to be captured on film? Who cares? Perhaps He already has, and whoever was taking the picture or filming didn't recognize it as a miracle but thought it was a misperception. People are remarkably talented at dismissing anything that doesn't fit into the way they think the universe works. This includes materialists. Or perhaps He will at some point, but as I said: the people who choose to believe will, and those who choose not to won't. We wouldn't see any sudden surge in believers because of it, at least none that would be planted in fertile ground and last. So why haven't we had any saints' miracles widely disseminated in a popular media form? Because God has not yet decided that it is conducive to His purpose. What other answer do we need? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've let her know that I'm there for her, but she's like me and she hates serious talks. I'm hoping that she's been opening up to her friends. She's shared her ED and the fact that she's getting treatment with them, so that's good. She also says that at the center where she goes during the week, all they do is lounge, talk, and eat, which is relaxing and helps her recover. She's very stressed when she's at home and has trouble eating there. It's better when I sit with her and chat and take her mind off it, but her dad is very goal-focused and tries hard to make sure she meets the quota they gave her. She needs to eat x number of meat proteins, etc. This pressure also stresses her out and makes it harder to actually hot the goals. She's under where she should be based on the recovery timeline they set out and I think the insurance will only cover if she hits certain weight goals each week, which stresses her out more because she knows their money is tight.

With schoolwork, I may be helping one of her friends study for the SAT if her mom okays it, and it might turn into a group study, which could be good for her. I also worry about the sleepover thing, but I think the rationale is that they can't make sure she's eating what she needs to and can't help if something goes wrong. I agree that it's a further lack of control though, which is something she really needs to feel in her life. She does want to get better though, and has goals for what to do when she's healthy, which I think will help. We're going to a convention over the summer, and she's traveling to Poland with the church youth group, but she can only do that if she's healthy enough for travel, which I think will help motivate her. 

Thank you for the advice. I'll try to not comment on whatever she eats while I'm around her, too. I try to focus on showing her funny things I find, or our mutual interests, and not whatever she happens to be eating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of these kinds of arguments boil down to basically consequentialism. We are to encourage virtue and discourage vice in our government, just as in our personal lives we do good and avoid evil. The actions themselves are sometimes intrinsically evil, and therefore to be avoided no matter what "good" results they may seem to bring. For example, if it were systematically, mathematically provable that murder, theft, and rape would plummet to almost nothing if we were to execute 10,000 people every year based on some indicating traits or genetic factors, it would still be murder and still immoral to do it or vote for politicians who wish to adopt such policies. And abortion kills far more than 10,000 people per year. 

Make no mistake, we are in the trenches of a horrifying time in human history, when personal convenience and comfort are expected at all cost, even eliminating the next generation. It's right up there with exposing infants, which the Church also condemned and early Christians derided, frequently saving and raising the children. And now that we're in the position of the comfortable, with more resources available per human than any time in history, we decide that there isn't enough to go around. This is a sickness of culture, and not something that can be fought through mitigating outcomes to try and make quantifiably less abortions happen, but rather needs to aim at the roots of a mindset that led to such things being possible. This cannot be done with consequence-based compromises. We must be firm and unyielding in both faith and morality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just found out that my little sister (not by blood but I'm close with her family and think of her like one) was diagnosed with anorexia. She eats fine when I'm around or with her family, but I guess it's been an issue at school and other places. I'm glad they finally got a diagnosis since everyone's been worried about her for a long time, but she's been denying that she has a problem. She'll be going to therapy, which I'm hoping they'll be able to keep doing since her family has always struggled financially. I don't know if their health insurance covers it. 

In any case, I want to know what I can do to help in any way. I just want her to be healthy and happy, to whatever degree that's possible. I've been reading up on what friends and family can do, and it's been some good advice, but also rather clinical and non-specific (as it needs to be since it's general advice) but I was hoping for more personal anecdotes. What have others done for people here that helped them to manage their disorders? 

She's been struggling in school due to being absent because of her health, and because she has trouble concentrating since she hasn't been eating enough. I've offered to give her help in any subjects where she's having trouble. I used to teach math, and she has the most difficulty with math, so I think that could help, but I'm guessing she'll be too proud to ask even if she needs it. Her parents have told her no more sleepovers or overnight trips until she shows healthier habits. Do you think that's a helpful step? Any ideas on what else I can do to support her? </TEXT>
