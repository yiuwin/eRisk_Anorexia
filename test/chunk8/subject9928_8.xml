	<TEXT> They're a plague to coral reefs. Ox gall is precisely what it says on the tin (I'm a printmaker and need the same substance for wholly different reasons, that's how I came to learn this bit), the injections actually contain TCBS agar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiosulfate-citrate-bile_salts-sucrose_agar), a medium of which ox gall is a constituting ingredient. TCBS is the perfect nourishment for vibrio bacteria (the same genus to which human cholera pathogens belong), a small and usually harmless amount the starfish contain anyway. The bacteria then multiply massively, leading to a fatal infection that can even spread to uninjected individuals. Nifty. Other treatments with other poison was less successful due to the starfish's extraordinary regenerative abilities. Killing them manually (dissecting, clubbing, whatever) is even more inefficient and also gets the divers injured frequently. Yup, the starfish are poisonous as well (and really hideous. And they like to munch on corals). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIL that crown-of-thorns starfish are killed by injecting them with a ox gall (!), causing them to develop an infection from which they die within twenty-four hours, developing "large, open sores that expose the internal organs". </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone,
I want to have a greater number of paintings than the game wants me to. Does anybody know a mod for that? I know it's not trivial, but I'm sure someone has come up with a way. Googling just leads me to threads where people explain how textures work and why you can't add more pics.
Thanks in advance for your help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kitsch supreme. But I really like the small boat in the dark corner.
