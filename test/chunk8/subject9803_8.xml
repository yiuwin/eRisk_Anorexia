	<TEXT> these prints turned out really well.... so aside.... if you don't mind me asking.... how much did those frames cost you o.o because i'm slightly scared to make anything over 24"x36" if i have to frame it due to framing costs.

	<TEXT> well i mean if i was a restaurant owner, and i had a party of 20 coming... I might set up an area that could accommodate 20 people, maybe something like a "banquet" area. and since that would take time to set up... and i'd probably have to bring in an extra staff or 2 just to set up/ take care of that group, i might make them put down a deposit, so i didn't get screwed over if they didn't show i mean 20 seats on a friday is kinda a big section to take on a misc called in rsvp. then maybe as a resturant owner, which some jackass comes into my restaurant, and probably throws a hissy fit about how he must have misunderstood the banquet reservation policy, i'd tell him or her to fuck off..... but thats just me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. You need a the materials surface to come into contact with the blocks face, and the canvas' weave makes that nearly impossible to get a good impression. 

Still really want to print on canvas? Well you could try loosening up the ink, which will allow it to get into the weave better, but you're going to loose detail, but if you're cool with that give it a go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I highly doubt it. He's the  #39 RB on ESPN, and think he's way to much of a gamble to go that high. I mean who how the RB dynamic will work out, his first year he could only see limited time depending on Bell. And outside of MI (where I am) no one watches preseason lions games.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well if the gays can't marry because of what the bible says, well then i'm pretty sure the bible also says that we should reinstate slavery. 

"'Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property."

	<TEXT> I go to broke spoke, it's a bike coop so you basically do your own repairs (they'll help you if you don't know what your doing) or you can have them do it for you I believe. 

Last summer my bottom bracket blew out on me, pedal power wanted somethin like 100+ bucks for a rebuild (that could be off but it was pretty expensive... Well expensive for my budget anyway). Being broke I went to broke spoke to check their prices, walked in, ended up rebuilding it myself (with help from a friendly volunteer) used some spare parts and it cost me something like 7.50. If your willing to learn and have the time, broke spoke is where it's at.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So if you look at this video, is me pulling a print. The piece of paper on the bed is my registration sheet. Its the same size as the actual print (though you could change that). then the plate basically has an outline that i just trace around the plate, and place it in the same spot every time.

http://www.philagrafika2010.org/

look around on there for less current, but more well rounded info. i'm pretty sure they had a bunch of print shops around, no idea how public/ private they were, but if you flick thru the "venue" tab i'm sure you could find some places, and email some people of ones that look promising </TEXT>

To clarify, this is NOT A RALLY. He won't be here. He will be broadcasting to the 1500 separate viewing parties that night, but he will not be in Lexington.

What we are trying, as part of creating a political revolution, is creating a grass-roots movement of millions and millions of people, Sanders said. On July 29 of this month, we will be holding what we believe will be the largest digital organizing event in the history of this country."

Come be a part of the largest digital organizing event in history. Join us and our grassroots revolution!

Al's Bar is willing to host us crazy Bernie folk! Please consider buying a burger or a beer while you're there. He will be broadcasting a live web address to us at 7pm. There will be cards to register to vote, as well as info about Bernie   the issues that you can take with you.

**THIS IS A RAIN OR SHINE EVENT. THERE IS LIMITED INDOOR SPACE BUT AL'S IS LETTING US USE THEIR OUTDOOR SPACE AS WELL, AND THEY CAN HOLD US THAT WAY!**

The Sanders campaign announced a nationwide effort to hold organizing meetings and house parties on July 29th! Sanders is rocketing up the polls, even raised $15 million since announcing April 30, not one cent of it from corporate donations.

https://secure.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/july29organizingmeetingat7pmetpt/4jvzc

Come because it'll be fun! Bernie Sanders has a lot of potential for being a candidate that can take this country by storm, but not without our help! </TEXT>
