	<TITLE> Financial aid after entrance bursary? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-30 19:31:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm an international student accepted at the Faculty of Engineering and my government provides no aid however McGill gave me a 9k entrance bursary. Although this means that I can stretch a little and pay my first year undergrad fees, I'm not sure how I can manage the next 3 years. So, my question is, how do I get financial aid in the later years? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Double integrals and partial derivatives? Definitely enough maths, justify your maths and explain it thoroughly. In fact partial derivatives, double integrals and cyclic integrals are beyond the syllabus itself. But remember that quality of maths is only 6 marks out of 20, if you perfect all the other criteria and do OKAY in maths you can still get a 3 or 4 out of 6 and end up with a 17 or 16 which is REALLY good. </TEXT>
