	<TEXT> You are severely misinformed. Oil is a part of our society that isn't going away any time soon. Oil is not just responsible for energy and the automotive industry. If we stopped using oil in the next 10-20 years wed be thrown back to the stone age. Not using oil is not an option. The issue is more of "what is the safest and most efficient way to transport oil." Pipelines are the safest and most efficient.

	<TEXT> Thats exactly my thought. I think updating to unity 5 just made the game look weird and feel weird. And now the devs seem completely uninterested in finishing the game at a reasonable pace. I was so excited about the soccer gamemode they showcased at E3 and even kept telling my friends "oh just buy the game they're gonna add soccer gammeode soon" but is been 6 months with 0 update on it, i cant keep defending the company anymore. They just simply dont seem to care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, severe decline in effort I feel, or at least effort to communicate with/update the community of this game. Mid-September they said they were gonna do monthly updates of the game(didn't end up happening) and also promised a full release of the game for Q4 of 2016(also didnt happen) and also INITIALLY promised the PS4 version to be released Q4 as well. This was then pushed back to Q1 2017 and now its apparently "eh it'll be done when its done". Im pretty angry that I bought this game honestly. The development is actually slower than any game I've ever seen and they just don't seem to care about it. I've been waiting for the soccer gamemode on PC for 6 months or really at minimum for them to port all single player maps to online(still hasnt happened yet)and without that It's hard to convince any friends to spend $20 on it. I haven't even heard a word on either of those being released/finished soon. They keep messing with all the wrong settings and keep breaking things that didn't need to be touched in the first place. This is like one of those games that could actually have a great community is the devs cared and talked at all with the community. They could great a cool competitive league for the game or something. You'd just think that for a group of people that have made at least 2 million off of a game they would at least keep developing it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes but the argument that this guy is saying here is that we come onto reddit to see cool and funny shit and get away from a lot of the political bullshit. And now even extremely politically irrelevant subs are pretty much becoming just more anti-trump subs. We literally cant get away from it. New subs keep just popping up quicker than we can filter them out. People with no political opinion would rather use this site as it was meant to be used and not have the same political opinion shoved down their throat at almost EVERY big sub reddit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy shit. For the first time in my life I feel genuinely angry about something that doesn't even directly involve me. I don't even know who to blame this on or how to even suggest fixing it. I want to say that this was a small group of masked rioters that infiltrated an otherwise peaceful protest but based on the videos I saw, it seems as if everyone at the protest was okay with this. Nobody was trying to stop the people getting violent. And this seems to happen at almost every protest now. Its always gets super violent when it goes into the night. I mean honestly how can we even go about fixing this? Let's say all these rioters are all part of an organization or movement that ruins peaceful protests. How would you pick out the bad protester from the good before anything bad happened? You couldn't. Not without infringing on somebody's rights. Let's say that these are what the left does to their protests once it gets dark. They put on hoods and start getting violent. What do you do then? Ban protests? That's never going to happen. This is like a lose-lose situation no matter what. This cant be stopped unless martial law is ordered. These are terrifying times suddenly.

But christ I don't like constantly having this shoved down my throat at every big default subreddit. Also it seems like a lot of the hit pieces are kinda far fetched like this one. "Oh no Trumps top national security adviser was being investigated for ties to Russia because it was a required investigation that every security adviser goes through before going into office.

	<TEXT> Yes exactly. Your calculations are also very low ball. The game is around 15-20 dollars and steam only takes about 35 percent so boneloaf made around 4 million at least on this after everyone has taken their cut. There is no reason why they should not be developing this game full time and giving weekly updates. Just with how slow development is you'd think this is a tiny one person game studio that is almost out of money. Honestly it's a bit ridiculous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The team is 4 people in size plus whoever they work with at coat sink for the online and also it should be their job to develop this game. Its sold hundreds of thousands of copies. They should be having plenty of money streaming in from this game. They also have a pretty large publisher publishing them so they should have plenty of support for the game from them. On top of all of that I'm just asking for a simple update about the future of the game as it seems like they never do that and the game wasn't released when it was supposed to be released. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The game was supposed to be fully released before the end of 2016 with all the new game modes and maps but it just seems like that didn't happen. I'm wondering if anyone (possibly a dev) could tell me exactly what is going on with the game currently. It seems like every patch now somehow breaks the game even more than before. And very small (unnoticeable) fixes actually occur. Hopefully that means that the team is distracted by a bigger, more complete update that is in the works. I would just like to know a roadmap for the last couple of updates to this game. Like when the soccer gamemode will be in. And when will all the maps be ported to online game mode. And maybe a slightly less fidgety main menu. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a lot better than stock imo. I completely reflashed the stock os by putting the image files for v10d onto my external sd and flashing it on with twrp. It fixed my phone from being stuck in the boot loop. I relocked the phone and pretty much completely restarted the process of unlocking the phone and then rooting it (I used easy recowvery with the script that automated a lot of it and also installed superuser through that ). I installed twrp and then put the maximum overdrive ROM onto my external SD and installed it through twrp. After I did that I set up the phone for first time use and then installed the update by dirty flashing.   If you want a step by step guide on here I'll put one up with all the links too if there is enough demand for it

	<TEXT> I like all the function of the vehicles in the game so far except for the steering of the trucks and rovers. I feel like they should be basic  wasd and you should be able to set which way is the front and back of the truck or rover. Another thing I suggest is to make it so that trucks can get over small rocks easier. A truck should definitely be able to get over small space rocks with relative ease but right now its like a 10-15 detour per rock to figit with the truck and get it over. I think the rover should maybe have more trouble getting over rocks since it is just a rover but the truck really shouldn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm surprised I had to go so far down to find this.

Unfortunately it isn't that surprising anymore. Reddit is completely biased against trump. You wont find anything pro-trump/anti-DNC on the front page because it is deleted almost instantly by the admins of the site(besides r/The_Donald which they've pretty much banashed from the rest of reddit at this point). If any comment remotely critical of Clinton or the DNC reaches top status on a front page post, the entire post will suddenly get deleted. To be honest, I didn't even become a massive trump supporter until I realized how much shit he said was blown out of proportion or just twisted to an insane degree. 90% of the stuff you see him supposedly say that looks so awful is actually very reasonable stuff that the main stream media picks and chooses parts from to make their own words for him out of. Its awful.

	<TEXT> You should make a complete single player experience and keep with the art style cause the super simple art style is so fresh but still well done and then after the game you want is completely realized(and maybe after you've made some money off of it) go back and make a completely independent multiplayer version of the game with little tweaks because this game doesn't need any special rework for the multiplayer. It just needs multiplayer. super simple and dedicated server tool only. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks man. Hearing from one of you guys really means a lot. Especially on reddit. We wanna try to help grow the community because we feel as if this game has some serious potential once it is all cleaned up and has some more features(some of which you guys have recently announced). I appreciate your response and look forward to playing the new update when it is released. Also my apologies for being so critical of this game. I'm sure you can understand that it is a bit frustrating to pay $20 for a game and not hear much about it in terms of updates for a while. But again this response helps a lot. Keep up the work!. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is very much a step in the right direction and I cannot wait to try out the dedicated server tool. The only thing I am kinda still worried about is the state of the gameplay. What I mean by that is what gamemodes are coming with this update or is it pretty much just gonna be the same 5 maps online and the same gamemode still. Hopefully they show an updated version of the game at PSX and it has a bunch of new content other than just the player customization stuff. Maybe why they didn't include info in this about it in this is because they will be showing it off soon and wanted us to wait and see what they added in terms of gameplay </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Not a fan of the new Casey and CNN deal </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-28 20:29:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It sounds like it is going to be another way for a major news network to push their agenda. Casey always loved YouTube because of the freedom he had while doing it. Nobody was pushing anything, nobody wanted to push anything. It was all a big open platform where he could directly interact with viewers and listen to all kinds of different opinion. With this deal I feel like he will pretty much be pushing topics in a direction that CNN wants him to go which is bad and way against what he always preaches. I'm afraid to say that I think Casey is a sellout. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I think what you're saying is valid, you also have to consider that people have been and are being prosecuted for things they say on Reddit. So if an admin can go through and secretly edit posts and does so often, whose to say that the person who said those things even actually said them? We also have tons of extremely important people on here doing AMA's. What if spez decides he wants to fuck around and change something the president says in an AMA to stir up international controversy? I mean Reddit may be a privately owned site but its so big and important for free speech that there HAS to be some sort of checks and balances between the admins. That's why checks and balances exists in government to begin with, so one party or branch cant be infinitely powerful and pretty much have free reign over what happens. </TEXT>
