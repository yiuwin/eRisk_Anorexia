	<TEXT> Administrative is a must for anything else than merchant republics thinking of staying a Merchant Republic. After that, its your choice. Take your ideas depending on your country. If you were the Commonwealth, innonative would be unwise as your %33 cavalry combat abilty can be stacked with aristocracy+ aristocracy-espionage policy to crushingly deadly effect. (Even deadlier for the hordes, try it out !)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> %25 coring discount is the single best idea in the game. Get it before coring anything, it adds up to huge amounts of adm points as time goes, and is the secret behind the Kebab success. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Go for the south african gold. Grab them all and develop those provinces on production. With massive money get the best advisors. And import all the institutions with your extra points.
