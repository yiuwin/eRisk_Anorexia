	<TEXT> I don't know if this answers your question, but I've been considering an army campaign for a while now and I was going to try a similar overall concept.

I planned on having the group marching with the head of the army (the person calling the shots). One scenario would be something like this:

"You are marching with General Manheim when a messenger quickly runs to the generals side, delivering a small note bearing the seal of Captain Dorn. Manheim then informs you that three emergencies are simultaneously occurring under Dorn's command and he needs help:

* The army scouts have come into contact with a small group of enemy scouts. They are being pinned down but must be eliminated to keep the element of surprise.

* A skirmish broke out in the rear of the supply line when a group of owlbears (or other CR appropriate monster) attacked the trailing wagons. 

* A small mutiny has broken out in the 3rd company and must be resolved.

General Manheim informs you that due to time constraints your party can only tackle one of these and he will have to send less experienced soldiers out to handle the rest."

The resulting consequences could be less supplies, mutinied soldiers who fled and killed other soldiers, and/or enemy scouts informing the opposing army of your position. This can further lead to mutiny due to less supplies, mutinied soldiers attacking the rear, more soldiers dying than would have originally due to better enemy positioning, etc.

This will kind of force the players to choose what they deem to be more valuable and good players may even find a way to help negate some of the negatives from the other events they could not handle. This way you prep three situations, some blatantly resolved by combat (the monsters at the supply train) while others can be RPd (like the mutinied soldiers or even the enemy scouts). These small encounters could be handled in 15-45 minutes (depending upon your players as well as your own efficiency). 

I think a few of these, with consequences the players can see and feel, will lead to a fun campaign. Of course I've never tried it. This is just me thinking about it on and off for the past few weeks/months.  </TEXT>

Some good moderation and a new surge of users could really boost that sub tbh. Especially if they get rid of the automatic nsfw tags. Some of the best and most representative posts of all time were SFW- like the gorilla charging the zoo glass at an incredible speed. Or the whales using teamwork and waves to knock a seal off of an iceberg.

	<TEXT> In the adult world, it's your responsibility to figure out how to get to work when your employer needs you to. If you routinely get stuck on trains, you should probably plan on getting there early, moving closer to your job, or finding a more reliable means of transportation.

Yeah this really isn't  a thing in some places. Especially NYC where trains can be so unpredictable. You can leave an hour earlier I guess in case that random hour delay hits, but that's mostly just silly and no employer should expect that. 

I was already planning to quit because I don't believe in their business practices, ethics, and products. 

Why would you even take a job at a company, that you know you don't like, if you are planning on quitting? </TEXT>

I'm pretty sure I'm not splitting hairs at all. If a police officer witnesses me robbing a bank, he doesn't have to arrest me. There is no law telling him he had to. He will of course get fired for not doing his job. But no law compels him to do so.

and compares it to....I think being a porn star who doesn't like their job?

Yeah pretty much. They heavily based him on The Dark Knight ~~Rises~~Returns, where he is super buff and ~~very pro-killing~~ (I was off here. Snyder interpreted the Miller comic to mean Batman kills, it's up for debate), so this version didn't feel too radical. Although I felt Affleck's portrayal, poorly written or not, was incredibly spot on.  </TEXT>

Why was this not addressed in the drama? That's some pretty sexist shit. 

Also there is this little gem: 

For real. If I had a daughter, I would watch her get nailed all day. But I'm not an "old fashioned" "american". Shit, bring on the double penetration, golden showers and rape play.

I'm a modern man and watching close family members fucking is cool by me. Acting or not.

	<TEXT> The whole point of this Batman is that he's not the Batman from the comics. He was once upon a time, but the death of Robin and now the loss of so many Wayne employees during BvS has hardened him. He's angry and trying to take it out on Superman. That makes way more sense to me, because a "normal" Batman would never be so angry as to try and take on Superman. He'd be patient, study him, observe, and realize he isn't dangerous.

This Batman is the opposite because of the huge loss he has faced and now he is destitute and broken- willing to do anything and cut corners (including kill), when beforehand he wouldn't have.

He was the only part of BvS that made sense to me tbh. I think BvS tried to convey at the end that he is going to change and go back to his roots of trying not to be so dark and violent. 

Also I think we're all getting such conflicted and different opinions because the movie did such a poor job at portraying his inner conflict vs his actions. </TEXT>
