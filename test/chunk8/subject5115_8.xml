	<TEXT> the thing with Aus is that we came too late to the esport scene. Also the mind set of making money from gaming is less heard of here compared to the US. But i personally know a lot of esport followers but  they dont follow anything in OCE because there is nothing to represent. If OCE ever won anything it would really boost the region to an audience. 

ALSO people dont seem to realise that the article doesnt conclusively say that AFL is going to absolutely do it. They have just considered it </TEXT>
