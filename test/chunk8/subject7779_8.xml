	<TEXT> Because there are parts where you have to progress the story in order for you to access the other Chocographs. I remember by the end of Disk 3 I already had a Gold Chocobo. I remember it vividly because the last time I finish FF9 on my recent playthrough was March 2016.

I think I made you confused. Sorry bro.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To make your Chocobo Gold is not a Key Item. When you open a treasure chest and a smoke comes out, thats the time when your chocobo transforms. Ozma is preferably good to beat at Disk 4 since there are chocographs that aren't accessible at disk 2. 

Besides Chocobo Forest there is also Chocobo Lagoon then Chocobo Sky Garden.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's ok! I love to talk about this! You're only in disk 2 and you haven't missed a lot. There are people whom I personally know who started and completed the chocobo sidequest in Disk 4 so you have no worries. Even the friendly monsters are possible to encounter at disk 3. I forgot if you'll be able to encounter them in disk 4. Hope that someone can clarify us for that.  </TEXT>

There are key items that called [Chocograph that lets you find rare items and equipments in the world map, including the entire ocean, throughout the game](/spoiler). You'll obtain [Zidane's Ultimate weapon on that Sidequest, the Ultima Weapon](/spoiler), [Garnet/Dagger's Ultimate Rod](/spoiler), [An Ultimate Racket where Garnet/Dagger and another party member can use](/spoiler), [Freya's Ultimate Weapon](/spoiler), [Stainer's second to the Ultimate Weapon because his Uber weapon is ridiculous to get. Not worth the time IMO. But if you speedrun the game, you'll be able to get it.](/spoiler), and [Armors and Accessories that gives great stats!](/spoiler)

Also, [there are some treasures on the Chocograph lets you "evolve" your chocobo from Yellow to Light Blue to Red to Navy Blue to Gold.](/spoiler) 

[Yellow color is the normal Chocobo, Light Blue enables you to walk on Shallow Water, Red enables you to climb mountains, Navy Blue enables you to walk on deep water and Gold enables you to FLY!](/spoiler). Lastly, [If  you manage to get a Gold chocobo and got to Chocobo Sky Garden, only accessible to Gold Chocobos, you'll be able to fight an Optional super boss.](/spoiler) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Happy Holidays everyone!

I played too much Final Fantasy XV. BTW I'm on Chapter 8 at level 75 doing plenty of sidequests. Sinusulit ko itong game na to! Also should try this food IRL. http://imgur.com/tch0LoC

Plenty of my friends prefer Meat on their Cup Noodles but I like Shrimp in my Cup Noodles. </TEXT>

[Cactuar that gives 5k to 7k EXP which is already available in Chapter 1](/spoiler)

and farming out AP by one hit killing Warp-Strike Sabertusks and Scorpions.

Managed to get Health Level, Health Level II, Magic Level, Strength Level, Vitality Level, Spirit Level and Experimagic in Ascension Grid as early as Chapter 1 before advancing to Chapter 2 on that

As of last night I already have around 120k EXP and farming APs to get Health Level II, Magic Level, Strength Level, Spirit Level, Vitality Level and Experimagic in my Ascension Grid! Magic Action was also a big help getting APs!

	<TEXT> The last time I watched this movie was around August and thought of watching it again to refresh my memory and putting all the pieces together even though I'm still in Chapter 1 hunting Cactuars, and Farming AP before doing the level jump by the end of Chapter 1. (My party is currently at level 10. I ended up saving 107k EXP and still farming two sets of 99AP for Experimagic and Health Level II.)

Basing from the movie. Niflheim can control Daemons and why do they have plenty of Diamond Weapon? Also who did Nix summon while he was battling Glauca? </TEXT>
