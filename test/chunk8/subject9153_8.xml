	<TEXT> Of course, just noting this, they gain a lot less of stats.

But that's not too bad, some gacha characters also have little stat gains, I wasted all of my phy orbs on Gotenks (without dupes but still) and only got it to +220 atk.

Super Strike teams will be very competitive, at least on par with current op teams, if you fully awaken them; dodges, multiple attacks and more SA damage make you OP regardless of stats </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im so sad I wasted my Janemba on the lower right path, you need max SA to unlock those ones. I have him SA 2 and only had 1 dupe, so I cant do anything else.

So sad because just 1 dupe is enough to get a REALLY strong character. I had a TEQgetto dupe and now his Super ATK Damage is at level 8 and +500 in every stat, by going into the upper right path, the one with just 1 star.

Janemba would have been a beast

I hope they give us easy Elder kais, only way to fix this is maxing Janemba so I can unlock his skills </TEXT>

And I'm laughing at how similar to Digimon 02 it was. I was half expecting Trunks to pull his laser cannon out and delete Zamasmoke

Also, Gowasu scene made me sad too. He was just an old kai chilling with Zamasu and watching ningen, too bad it had to end like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I like to powerscale GT off Super.

GT has a severe lack of feats but they were supposed to be absurdly strong, so, for example, I put Baby Vegeta 2 a little below SSG Goku. Once transformed he would be strong like Golden Frieza, a little stronger than Goku.

Baby was absorbing the negativity of the planet and even did a hand-holding ritual, so I like to think he reached the god-realm of power. 

That leaves us with SSJ4 at SSG/SSB level, a fair comparison I think. 

But not even that was enough to beat Super 17, lets put him at Super Saiyan Rose level. Without finding a weakness, he was just unbeatable

And I think Syn Shenron is an equal to Beerus. Goku couldn't do a thing to him EVEN IN SSJ4. He could only beat him once fully mastering the form, just as I think he could beat Beerus once he finishes his training.

But once Syn becomes Omega, all that means nothing. They can't even scratch him. Until they fuse, so SSJ4 Gogeta should be well above Beerus but still below Whis.

That's my headcanon obviously, in reality you could just assume that in GT they never reached God-ki level, BUT there's Frieza. Freaking Frieza trained 4 months and got that level without being a God. So... </TEXT>

I don't think people should indulge in that kind of entertainment, BUT, making it illegal seems a bit too far since it's better than alcohol and cigarettes.

	<TEXT> Extreme is a sure win to any event. 

Omega Shenron, Syn Shenron, Buuhan, Baby Vegeta 2, Black, Lord Chilled and Eis Shenron are good cards that reduce ATK so you only take like 200 damage. There are probably others that I forgot. 

Also, the best blockers are Extreme I think. Both Golden Friezas only depend on health and Janemba is unconditional. 

So yeah, unless they create a Dokkan boss with debuff immunity, Extreme should easily take on any event, but it would take a little longer than Super.

Super does much, MUCH more damage just with 2 SSB Vegitos and 1 Super Vegito tho. If you ever get those 3 in the same turn and use a Baba, you will probably end the fight if the Boss attacks multiple times.


But you still risk dying if you are careless with Super characters. Especially since I see people saying that bringing a Super Sealer is a waste of slot, without SSJ3 Vegeta you're gonna eat those 80k super attacks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favorite moment would be when he gets punched by Trunks and just laughs it off, then getting punched by Goku and still acting like a psycho. That truly felt dangerous. Also, his comeback against Vegeta.

I feel like his character was wasted in the end.

Just before going to check Zamasu up, he got the upperhand against Vegeta and Goku with his new Scythe. Right there he was stronger and was like "Yes I'll finish you off once you're tired"

He never stopped getting stronger, so fusing wasn't really needed. I mean, he was talking like "I don't even know my own power anymore"

He could have kicked their asses again with the clones and new-found powers, but he got emotional because Zamasu, a god, was being beaten by Trunks, and decided to overkill the saiyans with fusion.

If Black hadn't fused, who knows what would have happened. Goku and Vegeta wouldn't even remember Vegito so it'd be a tough fight. </TEXT>

A King and a Queen, a population consisting on mostly beautiful white people, a strong and respected army and a total disrepect for anything not normative.

	<TEXT> No, it is heavily implied by manga sources that Zamasu took over a Goku's body who was pretty much the same as this one, already with god powers and a friend of Beerus.

So, it was a matter of unlocking his potential like Ginyu. 

It would make sense that Zamasu told Black that if they killed Goku, he wouldn't get any stronger anymore. Fighting against the same body he has unlocks his power. I don't think he's that much stronger than Goku, Zamasu just added his own power. </TEXT>

Remember how Perfect Cell first defeated Vegeta as if he was nothing? Well, Goku was fighting against Cell. And Gohan was stronger, he took a beating and could still move. Vegeta would have been long dead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He just reduces the damage you do, like Gotenks or Buuhan, it's a very long battle. GT link is what does high damage (but GT units are weak so...)

My AGL Whis never once failed to stun him by the way, that's how I won since I only had 1 senzu left when I got to STR Omega Shenron.

If someone else wants to test their luck, bring your AGL Whis. It might have been RNG or a glitch. Stunned 100% of the time.

I don't know how would I beat him if he was actually attacking all turns. </TEXT>

I was hoping they removed Rs from the gacha pool and they just created new ones.

Was it so hard to make them playable? They really hate villains 

If they were SR we could at least create a usable gimmick team.

I guess we'll never get an SSR Ginyu team  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People like to think that rape is some special thing from hell instead of just another crime, and it shows.

Just like with any other crime, you've got procedures and stuff to go through to prove if the accused actually did it. You can't just claim that someone is the murderer or a thief, and rape isn't any different.

Sorry but you're not special. Go use a kit or something within the day limit and show proof that he did it. You can't? Tough luck. That innocent dude will go on with his life, or if he was a criminal, he got away, but that happens with everything, it's how the world works. </TEXT>
