	<TEXT> Nah, a lot of people are on the same page as you and I think you made your point quite civilly. 

On one hand, a lot of us are absolutely thankful to NSP/GG for introducing us to TWRP, because that's the reason a lot of us are here. On the other hand, (I can't speak for everyone but) I don't think many TWRP fans like them *because* they collaborate together.   

They're an awesome combination, for sure, but the whole "mega band" schtick is beginning to lose it's magic. That's not to say I won't support them no matter what they choose to do :0 This EP already sounds incredible and I'll continue enjoying them even if NSP is on every track; but yes, I can definitely see where you're coming from!  </TEXT>
