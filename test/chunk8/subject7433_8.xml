	<TITLE> Starting an eBay store? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi all,


I am planning on opening an eBay store here in Australia to sell sealed Japanese and English product as well as singles, and I was wondering if anyone on here had some suggestion on what else I should sell (such as mystery power boxes, Japanese sleeves, Japanese pikachu boxes etc...), and if anyone here runs a store themselves, what should I look out for and how should I ship the products to customers?


Thanks

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I found out this place existed because you guys are trending (congrats!), anyways, I have an old dell server tower in my garage that is collecting dust (I used to use it for a Minecraft PE server), so I was wondering if anyone here knew of anything interesting I can do with it?

Thanks

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I am saving up to go on a holiday to Japan next year for about a week, and I was wondering if anyone here would recommend staying only at a manga kissa while there?

I am asking because it seems to be the cheapest accommodation out there, and I am a poor high school student who can't really afford to stay at a hotel every night.


Thanks

Then Just use chrome to translate the pages and use a service such as tenso.com to proxy the cards to you in the US :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [AU, WW (preferably AU)] [H] Japanese Moon 066/060 Lillie Full Art Trainer [W] Japanese sealed booster box (specifically phantom gate) + 2 cards from Japanese sun and moon </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-24 11:48:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I am wanting to trade my Japanese Lillie full art from collection Moon for a sealed Japanese booster box plus these two cards:

Collection sun:

050/060 Gumshoos GX


Collecion Moon:

028/060 Lunala GX


For the booster box, I am specificity looking for Phantom Gate in Japanese.

If you feel like this is a very one sided trade, I have plenty of English GX from Sun and Moon as well as some EX's from BREAKpoint, BREAKthrough and Evolutions. Feel free to ask what I have available :)


Photos are available on request :)


Thanks
