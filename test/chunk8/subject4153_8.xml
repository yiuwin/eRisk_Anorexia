	<TEXT> I guess I'm going to have to pick ones if these guys up some day. When they were announced, I was convinced, considering even Hot Toys figures often get aftermarket clothes upgrades to get as close to perfect as possible, that there was no way a mass market company could do 1:12 scale soft goods very well at all. And especially when it was Mezco, a company I'd loved but seemed to have given up in regards to doing everything I used to love about them. I figured they'd have the exact same appeal for me as Neca's crappy Megos.  

But...everyone seems to love them. Not just good for clothes figures or good for Mezco, they seem to be genuinely impressive figures on any term. 

They're a bit too pricey to be a very frivolous purchase, but when the right character comes along, I'm excited to see what all the hubbub is about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! It blows my mind...not just with art, but with every category...that I ever see a repeat over months and months, let alone seeing the same photo in the same day. There is zero reason logistically that needs to happen. You'd think it was a licensing issue or something where Paula Oakley paid Google for her spotlight..but I really don't think that's how it works. There shouldn't be any legal problems featuring any of the art in the Cultural Institute...and yet, here we are seeing one artist's entire portfolio over and over again. </TEXT>

Though, I happily would've bought a whole mixed wave if they build-a-figure was a life size Baby Groot. That seems like such a no brainer for a hot toy, hopefully it'll be coming as a separate product outside of a Legend wave. </TEXT>

In theory I love the idea of 100 hour games, but I just can't maintain my motivation through all of their challenges. But Bully is long enough, with just enough side missions and collectibles that I don't get bored. Mmm...and that soundtrack, fantastic. 

I love it so much I'm almost assuredly going to buy this port and it'll be the fourth time(PS2, 360, PC) I've happily bought it and beaten it.  </TEXT>

It's designed specifically for only those components, don't think you could squeeze in a pen or pencil anywhere. But it's almost everything you want taken care of in one nice tiny package.

To make this fit on this subreddit, I interpret it more as "Don't confuse excitement with happiness". I know I'm guilty of wishing I wanted to engage in activities usually viewed as being geared more towards extroverts because society paints them as the most acceptable, celebrated forms of fun and excitement. But for me, the "excitement"...music, dancing, lights, crowds...of going to a party would be dreadful compared to staying home and watching a movie or playing a video game. It's silly to wish I could conform to another personality type to try to be happy when I have things that make me happy as is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agree to disagree, I suppose. I don't picture the movie attempting to encompass much of the world at all, or make a lot of references to other King books that aren't necessary or would be picked up on by the casual audience members. And judging what little we can from the trailer and set reports, it doesn't appear like changes being made were done to distill and streamline a complicated story for a movie. They just decided to make a new complicated story.

I don't want the movie to be bad. I'll be thrilled to be pleasantly surprised. But I also don't *need* the movie to be good, like a lot of folks seem to. Forcing them to bend over backwards accepting any odd decisions being made by the filmmakers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, it's the question of, "At one point do we draw the line of something being an adaptation and something being a unique entity that's trying to use a familiar title and some characters as window dressing to bring in people that wouldn't be as interested in an unknown property." It's kinda feeling more and more like the latter. It's not about being an absolute slave to the books, but I'd believe if it came out later that they took a wholly unrelated generic sci fi script and plopped Dark Tower characters on top of it and tweaked it a little. 

This isn't a Marvel movie with decades of source material that when taken as a whole could be seen as conflicting and schizophrenic and filmmakers can understandably sift through and contort and adjust as necessary. It's a finite series of books with a rather straight-forward story. It's not outlandish when fans of books would be excited about the prospect of seeing the pages brought to life and not immediately falling in love with something going entirely on its own tangent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So many readers who defended the odd Idris Elba casting shrugged it off because this was just a new cycle, like Roland was Doctor Who...when I've never heard that interpretation of events ever in the ten years or so of being a reader and fan of the series. It just comes off as extreme mental gymnastics to accept every poor decision that the filmmakers come up with.

My thinking was that every cycle was close to being the same as the last with little improvements from different choices each time. Like a high stakes Groundhog Day. Not an entirely unique adventure every time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always enjoyed anything that attempts to translate something too complex or immense or hidden to truly fully process or appreciate in our real life as a 2D representation that you can absorb basically at a glance. And so I love cutaway illustrations, blueprints, medical drawings, architectural plans..and maps. Oh my, do I love maps. Besides then falling into this category of graphic and having an attraction for that reason, I agree that there's also a strong narrative factor to any good map. You can't help but imagine people and civilizations inhabiting and traveling the lands and the incomprehensible level of history and tales that accompany them. To me, that's a really beautiful and wonderfully engaging feeling. </TEXT>
