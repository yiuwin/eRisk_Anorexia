	<TEXT> Who knows why the schools started banning students from bringing lunches from home, but I think the article explains it all on why.

The schools get funding from the Govt for these lunches, so if they require all the students eat the lunch the school provides means more funds and if you add in the low cost (Which looks like they are doing with their contract with ARAMARK) of these school lunches then they probably pocket the balance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me say this...

I originally subscribed to HULU 4 years ago when I decided to cut the cable and after 1 month I cancelled because of all the commercials.  I thought why am I paying a monthly fee if I am still getting commercials.

I recently (Last week) re-subscribed to HULU with the 12.99 no commercials subscription.

I haven't had time to watch any of their orginal content offerings.. but it really isn't that much.  

BUT!!!! Being able to watch other shows (Not just Network Broadcasting) I.E. Anime... Korean shows.. etc... It has just been wonderful... It has what Netflix does not offer, so having this along with Netflix my TV content has just grown.

The nice thing is the NO COMMERCIALS now.

Yes, there are a handful of shows that still will show an ad at the beg and end but all of the shows on that list I do not watch.
