	<TEXT> There might be an easier way to do this, probably a font out there.  
But anyways here's what I did; 

Duplicated many horizontal lines over the text and expanded the text.    

Divide the two with pathfinding  

now start selecting horizontally across the text and scaling randomly horizontally. 

Select random horizontal lines and vertically scale them down and shift them left or right. 

[Example: I cheated and used a blur at the end but I suspect the more horizontal lines you slice it by the more blurry it will look naturally. I obviously needed to use more lines.](http://i.imgur.com/uRpJOjA.jpg)

You can also tweak by selecting individual points and pulling them out.

	<TEXT> You'll know if you're getting dry hits by taste and the actual cotton will be burned and dry. Is that happening?   


You might need to use a lot less cotton, thicker juices will have trouble getting through the holes.  

Another way that may help but isn't ideal is to close off/cover all airflow and take small puffs to get that juice flowing into the rba base. (Kinda like a straw)

Be warned though all these tips may cause leaks so have a paper towel nearby.
  
  
Also another issue would be that the coils you're using are getting too hot and burning through juice faster than it can rewick. Should not be a problem with adjustable wattage/voltage/temp control though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of this depends on the Mod you're using.
  
  
Single coil will have a higher resistance, be better on battery life.
  
  
Dual coils, if you copy that same exact single coil and make another, will double your vapor output, create more or less heat, use more juice but give you more flavor, also have a lower resistance (1 / number of coils) so be careful and know what you're doing!

Should be fine, the only issue is that your limited to 60w and .2 ohms  
  
I'd stay with 26 and higher gauge wires. Going lower risks a too much ramp up time. Probably even higher if you are using Nickel Wire according to the calculator. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well to support that you could say it's possible that everyone on [the wheel](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/0/04/Gravity_Falls_Opening_Ending.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20140720073455) had or will make a deal with Bill(May have been off camera).

  
Let me put on my tin foil hat and also add that all those people are going to have to reluctantly come together to get rid of bill once and for all; probably holding hands in a circle like on the wheel.  
  
We've already seen enemies become friends so I wouldn't say it's impossible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Vape Wild's red rope was probably the best thing I've tried from them.  
  
 I actually didn't like much of their stuff, but Red Rope from them is probably one of my all time favs now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Say I use HTML5, Unity's Web Player, or something similar to show not full games but just examples of game mechanics I come up with. Is there a place where people already do this? Github? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had done this a few times before; every time they mention a game mechanic, make them pick an existing mechanic from a game they are familiar with, but ask them how it will be different.    
 
  
If they're like the people i've worked with in the past they will link you a bunch of youtube clips which is really helpful. 

Remember that when people think they are inventing a new game mechanic it's probably been done somewhere in the past before.  </TEXT>
