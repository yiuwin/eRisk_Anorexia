	<TEXT> Social media... gotta love the PR campaign we all trot out in front of friends and family. I wish people would be real with each other, but not in hurtful ways. 

Have you shared these feelings/thoughts with your parents? They obviously love you and would want to help in any way they could.

Holidays are weird, sometimes they make us happy, sometimes we're just numb to it all. I found that if I just put on the Jack Johnson music, all my worries seem to float away.

I don't want you to die. Get help before this spirals too far... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had the estimator come today, and the estimate arrive mere moments ago. Our estimated total was 6,119 lbs, which is about $10k to move. We can save about $5k by just packing things up ourselves and loading/unloading the container.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really love driving in Hawaii. It takes me a few days to adjust, but it is so much less stressful than here in LA. When I return to the mainland and get on the 405 freeway with everyone doing 80, I feel like I'm on a speedway. At first it's exhilarating, but then I realize it's 80 or bumper-to-bumper... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! I reached out to Royal Hawaiian to see if that is a better route for us, we'll see what they say. The 20' container is only 5200 door to door with Matson (and a 3rd party trucking company for the port-home part on the island), but I do have to load/unload myself. The part that makes it hard to compare is that Royal ships by pound and I honestly cannot even guess what the weight would be, but with a container I can visualize the size (I loaded containers as a job for a year of my life). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Moving to Kona in 1 month, what should I bring? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone, I posted a while back that I would be moving from California to Hawaii, and the comments from this sub were super helpful in making our plans. We have just signed a 14 month lease on a house in Kona (Pualani Estates), so we'll be packing up all our belongings in a 20' container in about 2 weeks. I'm curious what you all would recommend we bring and what you would leave behind (sell/giveaway). I have a wife and 2 kids, no pets, I'll be working from home. Are bicycles useful on the Big Island? What about some brand new IKEA furniture (unassembled, still in the box) - I live near an IKEA and I was thinking I could buy some here and sell it for a profit on CL in HI, if we don't end up needing it ourselves. We probably don't need every inch of the 20' container, and it's a fixed fee to ship it so weight is not a concern. I'm also planning to ship my 2009 Nissan Rogue as our family car, separately. Is there anything that is hard to find or expensive on the Big Island that I should bring over? Thoughts? Suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Loosely related... When I was about 9 I had been reading in my school's health book about something that I had not heard before. I decided to ask my dad what this was, in a loud clear voice, in the silent moment at a packed movie theater between when the previews end and the movie is about to start: "Dad, what's a bowel movement?". Lots of chuckles from strangers and I had no idea why. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did for a while... they fall apart after a few months and so I kept having to replace them. About 2 months ago I switched to the silicone tips and it's so much simpler to take them in and out. Also, the foam collects earwax like it's going out of style... then I display it to all my co-workers while they talk to me! Silicone is really the way to go. </TEXT>

I was on the school's team for 2 years, and the first day of practice for what would have been the 3rd year, my mom drove me there super late, so late that I actually saw the group running from the car window and had this epiphany that it was a complete waste of effort and decided not to go. My mom had plans to see "My best friend's wedding" at the movie theater, so there I was too, in my running clothes. I haven't ever been able to get back into running. </TEXT>
