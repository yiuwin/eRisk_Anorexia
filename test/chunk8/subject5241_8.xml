So my opinion doesn't count and now everybody loves short hair? I am so sick of their bs and their constant threats. It's getting old. I get it, they want me to be a little kid again and such, yet they don't realize I hate short hair and I feel like. Rap with it. They don't accept my opinion and when I try and give it they make it out to be me being rude.  </TEXT>
