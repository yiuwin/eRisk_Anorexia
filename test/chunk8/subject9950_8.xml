	<TITLE> Unpopular Opinion: I prefer Thor 2 to Thor </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-17 15:30:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There were scenes in Thor that didn't ring true such as the scene where Thor broke a mug and said "Another!"  Seriously?  People in Asgard break cups before they ask for another drink?  And this doesn't piss anybody off?

Darcy was more annoying in Thor than in Thor 2.  And the slapstick humor of Thor getting hit not once but twice by the same car?  And Darcy used her taser on Thor.  Why?  Because they thought he was drunk?

The humor was better in Thor 2.  Things like Thor getting on a subway and asking how to get to Greenwich.  Or hanging his hammer on a coat rack.  Loki was also a much more sympathetic character in Thor 2.  If he had a moustache in Thor he would have been twirling it the whole time.

The only problem I had with Thor 2 is the implied racism.  I mean, the Dark Elves aren't a real race but do they have to all be evil?  It's the same problem with Frost Giants, the Sakaarans and the Chituari.  We don't have this problem with the Kree or the Xandarians or any alien races that we consider sympathetic.  Anyway, this is more a problem with Marvel movies in general (or at least the cosmic ones) and not Thor 2 specifically. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Neither.

They dilute the brand when they replace Steve Rogers.  It becomes a role instead of an identity.  It is like when Tony Stark says "I am Iron Man".  Somebody else wearing Iron Man armor is not Iron Man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happens all the time in real life.  A foreigner comes up to you and speaks with an accent you don't understand.  Another foreigner from another country comes up to you and speaks with an accent you don't understand.  But then the two foreigners manage to successfully  talk to each other in English.  How?

First of all, a lot of people try to imitate how speakers of English speak and do a terrible job.  They think we speak quickly so they try to speak quickly to sound like us and they then expect us to understand.  Second, they probably don't understand what we are saying either but are too polite to say anything.  If you ask a foreigner a question and his answer makes no sense it could be because he was answering a completely different question.  (Example: "What have you done lately?" "Sorry, I missed the bus.")

When two foreigners are talking amongst themselves they speak slower because they don't expect the other person to understand them.  They also use simple words.  People all around the world learn "How are you?" "I'm fine."  I once said "What's up?" to a guy in Taiwan.  He stared at me for a minute and said "I'm fine."

Thor's speech patterns have changed starting from Thor 1 through Thor 3.  When Tony Stark says "Shakespeare in the Park?  Dost mother know thou wearest her drapes?" Thor was supposed to pick up on the fact that Tony was making fun of his accent.  Where is that accent now?  It's gone.  The Hulk is not a "Companion I have fought along side many times."  He is a "friend from work".

The same thing is happening to Drax.  His speech patterns were awkward and annoying.  He said "You green whore, you are my friend" in the first movie.  In the second movie he says "We are not friends.  We are [like] family."

There is one problem with this analysis.  When the Guardians meet they aren't on Earth.  They are on Xandar.  We hear them speaking English but they wouldn't actually have been speaking English.  And Ronin?  He was probably speaking Kree the whole time.  I mean, he wants to commit genocide and kill everybody on Xandar.  I seriously doubt he took the time to learn Xandarian.

This will need to be addressed in passing in Avengers Infinity War and Avengers 4.  Peter Quill presumably still remembers how to speak English.  The other Guardians, not just Drax, will have to rely on translators.  Hilarity ensues.    </TEXT>

"The Grandmaster appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy episode "Take the Milano and Run," voiced by Jason Spisak.[citation needed] He is shown to own the space station Conjunction. In the episode "Space Cowboys" the Grandmaster and the Collector are revealed to be brothers, both trying to kill each other. After The Collector tries to kill the Grandmaster with Moombas that explode if they eat anything other then grass the Grandmaster hires the Ravagers to bring the Moombas to Knowhere."

	<TEXT> I think you have to factor in the cost of special effects.  Let's say they kept Bobbi and Hunter on Agents of SHIELD and gave Daisy, Hellfire, Lincoln, Joey, Alicia and Yoyo their own show.  Every week they would have to show them using their powers.  On the other hand, Marvel's Most Wanted would have been cheap to produce because it wouldn't have required any special effects. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On paper, it is a brilliant idea: let's pretend that when contestants are eliminated they are literally "eliminated" so we have contestants presumably falling to their deaths, shredded by Nerf blades and crushed to death by moving walls.

It's worse than that though.  I refuse to believe that they actually built three identical rooms with a shredder and two identical rooms with moving walls when they could just as easily have teams go through the same room one at a time.  They would then edit the scenes together based on how long the teams took to escape the room.  Phrases like "You are behind" or "You are in first place: would be added in later.

The dumbest part is the final task when the final team is racing against the clock.  The host says "You are running out of time" or "You need to pick up the pace".  I'd be pissed if I lost because the host was wasting time telling me to hurry up and not reading the questions.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is that Professor Xavier is such a powerful telepath that if you introduce him then the show becomes about him.

X-Men: Gifted is currently filming and it stars Jamie Chung as Blink, Emma Dumont as Polaris and Blair Redford as Thunderbird.  They should set Legion and Gifted in the same universe.

Last week's episode (spoiler) had the interrogator at home with his husband.  This suggests that Legion is set in present day and that the sixties / seventies vibe we have gotten so far is just... dishes.

Let's have Blink, Polaris and Thunderbird appear in Legion Season 2.  Legion can use his telepathy and find out that they met Professor Xavier.  Maybe Legion can meet Xavier in the last episode of Season 2 and that can give him closure.

The next logical step would be to have Legion appear in Gifted Season 2.  They aren't going to have movie actors appear on TV.  The current actors are too young to play the present day X-Men anyway.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really think Danny Rand should have been biracial.  I realize that they considered this option and didn't go for it probably because they wanted to cast the right person regardless of race.  It's too bad Finn Jones isn't universally loved because that argument would be easier to accept if everybody had thought he was perfect in the role.

The only other thing that would have helped Iron Fist would have been a bigger budget.  Then we could have had flashbacks to Kun Lun.  Instead we had Danny and Davos talk about Kun Lun.  And instead of a full CGI dragon we only saw dragon eyes.

But I am glad they didn't attempt to show us Kun Lun on the cheap.  I thought the episode in China was well done.  I realize that they didn't have the budget to go to China but they did a good job of convincing me that they were in China just simply by having some signs in Chinese.

I think they wanted the series to be "grounded" which means that they weren't going to spend a lot of time in Kun Lun and they weren't going to have scenes with "wire fu".  Actually, I thought episode 6 was cheesy enough.  I think that was a bad place to leave people after they had previewed the first six episodes.

It probably would have helped if they had had fewer episodes.  Another approach would have been to cut the episodes we got down to 12 and then had the last episode be about Davos challenging Danny to a fight demanding that Danny return to Kun Lun.  Danny would have lost and Colleen would have asked to go back with him.  Then we would have had a better cliffhanger when Colleen, Davos and Danny returned to Kun Lun and found that the city wasn't there.   </TEXT>

I just saw the network broadcast premier of "Legion." Totally "Wow" experience. Kind of fun watching Bill Sienkievicz's brilliant visual concepts brought to real-world dramatic life, not simply in terms of visual effects but in the casting of a lead actor who has just as creepy a grin as our character. (Have to wonder as well if the background blimp character is the Shadow King? Probably not but ... ?) Serious Bravos to all concerned. And of course, the icing on the cake was seeing the (creator) credits for myself and Bill. So, basic response, I'm really looking forward to seeing what happens next. (I so really hate having to wait a whole week ... !)

Chris Claremont Actually, David, I was invited (as was Bill) to the premiere last week in LA; unfortunately, I had a prior commitment in Paris for the opening of a major exhibit (involving my work with Magneto, along with the work of other comics creators relating to the Holocaust) at the Shoah Memorial. In its own way, though, this was just as much fun. What're your thoughts?

Thanks SO much to everyone for the wonderful response to FX's LEGION. It's obviously a labor of love for everyone involved. 
I cannot begin to thank the execs, cast and crew:
Noah Hawley, Lauren Shuler Donner, Jeph Loeb, Bryan Singer, Derrick Hoffman, and so many others.
The perfect cast: Dan Stevens, Mackenzie Gray,Rachel Keller, Katie Aselton, Aubrey Plaza, Bill Irwin,Jeremie Harris, Jean Smart, David Selby...
And personally for me, thanks so much to all the readers and fans of the New Mutants comic book series-
Without you, your belief, and and your support I don't think we'd be here having this wonderful moment.
Chris Claremont And I connected this AM and we're both thrilled and proud as punch. We're aware the FX series isn't synched to comic book canon; but it definitely captures the energy and exploration and mind -bending fun we tried to bring to what we did. 
And without our editor, Annie Nocenti, we'd never have had a chance.
I'll definitely be tuning in every week. Hope you will too.

Mackenzie Gray Bill, it has been a pleasure getting to meet you- the whole cast was delighted that you were at the launch- and it is SUCH an honour and a privilege to be part of such an astounding, incredible show. Thank you for the shout-out and I'd like to add one-Canadian veteran actor David Ferry, who plays "Dr. Kissinger" whom Noah described as the "Man Who Would Be Kind To Cats" and put him in a corduroy suit and a wool sweater... David really played it perfectly. And look for Fargo alumnus Brad Mann who appeared at the end of the pilot who has some great stuff coming up.
By all accounts, we had quite the triumph last night. Onwards!

Bill Sienkiewicz you're absolutely right ! I was sadly remiss in giving him proper acknowledgement. I've seen cliched "shrinks" portrayed -poorly and ad nauseum- in so many productions that I usually cringe.-David Ferry was so terrific, so seamless, and on point, moving the story forward without a false note-i was almost sure they gave the role to an actual psychiatrist. My apologies.

Annie Nocenti Thank you Bill ! That was so long ago, but I have so many fond memories of the insane excitement that we were lunatics getting control of the asylum, getting to do whatever the F**K we wanted! With Legion I do remember wondering if anyone could follow the multiple dimensional narrative... and I guess everyone did! The guardian at the gate, Shooter, was by turns resistant to the wackiness, but also so bowled over by the creativity and enthusiasm of you and Chris, I do give him credit for *allowing* us to win almost every fight!

Chris Claremont What she said, my friend, with a vengeance. With Annie covering our editorial backs, we came up with a whole lot of cool stuff, that still makes me smile after far too many years -- my personal single issue favorite, "Slumber Party." Best intro of the coolest visual character ever (our Warlock) with the cameos to match.

Chris Claremont And best off, they even spelled our names right ("Chris"   especially "Bill" can really be a challenge, don't'chaknow?) Still wondering about the shape beneath the trees @ the end of episode 1. I'll be intrigued to see who *you* think it might be.

#LegionFX S1E4:
Random, immediate thoughts; (while viewing and post):
David's mindscape: I know this place. 
I really shouldn't be this giddy. 
Mojo?
Tears, awe, chills. (not necessarily in that order). 
Seriously , I shouldn't be this giddy. 
The music isn't 'just' a soundtrack, it's a character.
HmmmDr. Poole's (Scott Lawrence) eye looks really reallydodgyuh ohdamn
Oh my God.
A Ballet of heartbreaking mayhem.
Lump in throat. Three or four, actually. 
"That was a mistake."
Damn right.
Oh shit.
Immediate rewatch.
Thoughts post-post:
On Mackenzie Gray's FB note to me earlier on Wednesday: "I think you're going to like this one."
I more than liked it, Mackenzie... I Loved it.And to think this series is only 4 chapters in. 
How much better can it get?
You are frightening and mysterious and wonderful, as always. And it was a real treat to see you channel Syd. Can't wait to see what you do next.
On the duo of Bill Irwin/Amber Midthunder's silent empathic tour de force: This. Is absolute magic.
(Recollection: after seeing this , I'm suddenly even more retroactively thrilled that I was actually on the same stage with Bill Irwin and David Shiner in 'Fool Moon' in NYC, as an audience participant. I was appropriately awful. Bill and David made everyone look brilliant- but I digress.)
On the series: I don't want to leave anyone out. The cast is absolutely impeccable. Everyone- and everything- about this episode took my interest and investment up a notch.
And I must give special shoutouts to behind-the-scenes brilliance of Episode Director Larysa Kondracki, Episode writer Nathaniel Halpern, Musical director Jeff Russo.
Thank you, you Brilliant People.
Next week be here now.

Chris Claremont I stand with Bill on this   totally follow his lead. (Although I confess to still holding out for the Shadow King - I mean, this creepy baddie always seems to hang just out of focus in the, you guessed it, shadows. but time I hope will tell.) creepy one-eye is growing on me, too. Ick! Wonder if

Chris Claremont Annie-as I said to Bill, basically that turnabout is fair play (no, it isn't!) I hope you get the opportunity to indulge soon; it's a lot of fun, with a lead actor that seems more and more eerily (in terms of face and attitude / body language / expressions) like Bill's visual trope brought to life. I like him, and at the same time he scares me. Which is *so* cool!

Chris Claremont PS-based on tonight's show, my feelings re the big baddy have grown even more ... Intense (?) Why do I suspect a merging of simpatico consciousness between big baddy   the creepy predator ( who really needs to get a beat-down from someone in that cast) Before all is said   done? (But no new episodes 'til '18? That is *so * Dr. Who. ) time to pitch a story? David teams with the New Mutants - what d'ya think, Bill? 

Chris Claremont BTW-that should have read: time to pitch a new graphic (comics) story. Sorry about that, me   my bad typing! Sigh

Still mid-episode for this week's Legion, but so far, I'm grinning (  yes, that means it's kind'a really scary!) oh Bill, what *have* we done? 

Chris Claremont Not so bad an ending, eh? (False) Dog named "King," villain who hangs in shadows. "Alien" mentality who's been inhabiting David's consciousness for decades, again lurking in/ruling the shadows of his mind. Not satin' this is what it'll be but it sure has me grinning -   watching my back! Therapy, anyone? "Welcome all my friends to the session that'll never end!"-don't'chanknow?

Shocking, I know. 
I haven't seen this week's episode of #LegionFX yet. (been burning midnight Kirby oil-) otherwise I would've posted about it in my usual less than subdued fashion. 
That said, I will be watching tonight with popcorn and Laphroaig, a viewing regimen I recommend.
I hear there is some credible intel floating about as to the identity of the Villain.
You kids and your spoilers.

Bill Sienkiewicz I already know who it is. That just makes it all the better. I'm not dissuaded by spoilers. The brilliance of the show isn't contingent upon that for me, as each episode bears repeat viewings to savor the meaty goodness.

Chris Claremont Key thing to bear in mind, Jared, (with this or any adaptation) is that details are fungible; they can -- and often must -- change to fit the necessities of the form. the *key* is whether or not they get the essentials right. That was what made "God Loves" right; lots of details changed but the essential story was the one that John and I created. Same goes here. David Haller is the character Bill and I created brought brilliantly to life; he's everything we could have hoed for and more. The essence of the story   relationships *and* (it's looking like) major adversary are pretty much what we developed, filtered through the show-runner's vision mush as the writer's original concept in comics gets filtered through the artist to bring it to visual life.

First commercial break of tonight's "Legion," and right now, I'm grinning sooooo wide. This one's just plain cool. 

Chris Claremont Derek, damn I wish I'd headed west when I had the chance - but you and Lauren have helped bring this concept to video life and make it so good to watch   enjoy. Bravo! (  we still have half the show to go!)

Chris Claremont Actually, Job, David Haller is technically European / American: Gabrielle Haller (Mom) is a holocaust survivor who ends up in Israel; Charley (Dad) is, well, Charley. *But* -- one of the seminal figure inside David's head (because in the comics he's actually two real people living inside the same head) is a young Palestinian who David (as a child) struck down in self-defense during a terrorist attack. Living "together" now, both young men have come to an accommodation, possibly even a friendship. Or at least, that was my intent when Bill Sienkievicz   I created him. Glad to see you're enjoying the show. I am, too!
