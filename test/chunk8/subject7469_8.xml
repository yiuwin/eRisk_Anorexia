	<TITLE> I am looking to learn from a sydney Youtuber. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have had a few ideas about various video projects that I want to do and limited experience filming and the like.

If you know anyone who is making some quality videos for youtube, or has been doing it for a while now I would appreciate being able to get in contact with them and picking their brain on all the mistakes and pitfalls that you can run into when making content, also what it's like dealing with youtube as a content creator. 

I'm not looking to become an annoying youtuber that does pranks or chops stuff in half with a heated up knife, I am looking for people who make videos on their passion or have it as a side business. 

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been seeing this play out in the news for a couple of months. I am pretty sick and tired of seeing lots of words and no physical action. It seems like the liberal party doesn't give any kind of shit, it could be because of they view the people affected as not their voters,  or they just don't care about the poor. 

It doesn't matter their reasons for inaction. I feel we need to send a strong message. I feel like marching in protest. </TEXT>
