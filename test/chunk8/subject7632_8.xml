	<TEXT> In my opinion, I'd like your suggestion to work like this:

Prestige calculations stay exactly the same as for current gyms. Prestige affects the overall gym level. Not for each tier.

I think the tiers should be 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40.

A level 2 gym is level 2 on all tiers.

Defeating any of the tiers reduces the overall level just as before.

If it's a level 10 gym and the 31-40 has 10 Pokmon but the 1-10 has only 1 Pokmon, the 1-10 Pokmon will remain there until the last gym level.

Most importantly, the levels wouldn't be based on your trainer level, but rather your Pokmon levels.

I could be a level 30 trainer with a level 7 Lapras and be able to use it in the 1-10 tier.

Similarly, I should be able to drop a defender in any tier, however, I would then use up my slot for the entire gym. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also still wish that certain Pokmon had different flee animations. I know it'd be extra effort and purely nice-to-have but still.

* Kakuna and Metapod should retract upwards into a tree while hanging from their usual string.

* Slowpoke should flee reaaaaally slowly. I'd spend the extra 10 seconds every time watching a Slowpoke run away in slow motion just for that joke. Magikarp should (like Slowpoke) flop very slowly off the screen. Snorlax could also walk off very slowly.

* Ground types could just dig underground and disappear.

* Most flying Pokmon could probably fly away.

* Ghost types could just fade out of view.

* Porygon could glitch the screen around a bit and disappear.

* If there was actually water on the screen, most Water types could just dive in and disappear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even when I exit the Pokstop before it properly registers, I still get the streak notification on the game screen.

1) Does the first Pokstop for your day actually spin, turn purple and give you items?

2) If so, is it giving you more items than normal as per the expected streak functionality?

If all that is working, I don't see why you wouldn't see the streak notification. Maybe uninstall the app completely and reinstall it. It's all server-side anyway, so you won't lose any progress except maybe having to re-download some sprites etc. </TEXT>

 Haunter is based on the episode *Haunter versus Kadabra* in the original series.

	<TEXT> 1) Awful movesets - this has been here since the beginning. Every Pokmon has a set list of possible moves and that's fine. I've gotten some pretty terrible movesets too. That's how the game works.

2) So, I agree that the Pokmon that used to hatch from eggs were unfairly removed.

There's 100% of the player base... and maybe 10% of the player base complained about hatching common Pokmon.

I have only ever seen a handful of Magikarp and even Rattata. Until I recently started working in a new area, I never saw an Eevee. I think that it's unfair for anything to be removed from eggs. In that case, remove Charmander from eggs because I see them more often than some other players. Would that be fair? Of course not.

I know the point is to walk to new areas to play the game, but guess what? 10 km in every direction from me barely changes the biome. I can literally only catch the non-hatching Pokmon by driving around. I feel like this defeats the purpose of the game.

3) 2 Pokmon in a gym with a CP cap - Why would they do something stupid like this? What if I've transferred all my Pokmon under 1500CP? Does that mean I'll never be able to use a gym because I have better Pokmon? Nope. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great work :)

My only issue with this is that:

A) Most of these abilities already exist in the main games. Just a rename would be fine. 

eg. Venusaur's Attract -- Sweet Scent

eg. Growlithe's Howl -- Roar

B) Some of the Pokmon in your list already have well-known abilities in the games and you haven't used this.

eg. Rattata is one Pokmon known for the Ability "Pickup" which literally allows Rattata to randomly find items while walking.

If I have time later and nobody else has done it by then, I'll give you a list of suggestions (stuff that I think would be better in my own opinion) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So further info for the Desert2/ Lickitung biome off the top off my head (based on my findings since the start. I've used my discretion and my personal stats to separate the rarity tiers. I think it's sort of a given that every non-evolved Pokmon below can spawn in an evolved form too.)

I most commonly find Geodude, Sandshrew, Ekans, Nidoran M, Nidoran F, Cubone from Gen 1.

Uncommon but not too rare from Gen 1:
Growlithe, Rhyhorn, Zubat, Diglett, Ponyta, Machop, Mankey

Rare: Onix, Charmander, Vulpix, Doduo, Clefairy, Pidgey (Yes, Pidgey is pretty rare here. Don't laugh)

Very rare: Kabuto, Omanyte, Aerodactyl, Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, Ditto, Flareon, Lickitung

Since Gen 2 came out:

I most commonly find Snubble, Houndour and Slugma.

Uncommon but not too rare: Cyndaquil, Shuckle, Natu

Rare: Teddiursa, Phanpy, Gligar, Larvitar (Yes, Larvitar has popped up more often than the below)

Very rare: Skarmory, Mareep, Wobbuffet  (only seen one of each nearby. Could have just been a rare non-biome spawn)

Not sure: Hitmontop? I haven't seen one yet but it should theoretically spawn in this biome

EDIT: Added more info and more Pokmon </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have done some investigating and I understand there are two desert biomes.

One that frequently spawns Meowth and Mankey and one that does not. (Both can still spawn Meowth and Mankey but it is clear that one spawns them much more frequently than the other)

The frequent-Meowth desert biome spawns Chansey as a rare while the non-frequent-Meowth desert biome spawns Lickitung as a rare.

I noticed this especially during the Valentine's event and was able to practically draw a line between the two desert biomes in my area.

Since Gen 2 was released, I'm not sure of all the differences but I've seen Larvitar in both biomes but Mareep only in the Lickitung biome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if this applies to both iOS and Android, but I have the Android version of the app.

Is there a way to consolidate all notifications into "You have 32 notifications" or something?

I wrote a post and everytime someone comments, I get another notification. Checking my phone once an hour was leaving me with around 30 Reddit notifications to swipe away. It's becoming a bit too much to handle.

Yes, I want to know if I need to check my post, but not with so many separate notifications.

Is there a way to set this that I haven't noticed? Or if not, will it be changed any time soon? </TEXT>

However, I completely agree that there should be a way to tone down the CPU and Battery usage.

Maybe some in-game animation settings that allow you to remove some animation, graphic quality settings to minimize loading of resources etc. </TEXT>

That's pretty interesting.

I wonder if it's been set at specific spawn points in that case? Maybe it spawns at specific times there. :O

Check what time(s) it was caught if you can?

Since the Corsola "region" I'm willing to bet they changed at least one other type of spawn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it makes you feel any better, I moved to an apartment where there is exactly one Pokstop within map-rendering distance. The Pokstop is actually like 100m away from my apartment... BUT... it's not possible for me to reach it easily.

I live in a complex and the stop is in the worst possible place. It's like 50m out of reach from the edge of the complex wall and to actually get to it, I have to go 500m in the opposite direction to exit my complex from the only entrance/exit, go about 700m down the road, go about 1km around all my neighbouring complexes and then arrive onto that road and drive about 500m back down it.

It takes me about 3 or 4 minutes just to drive there because of stops, speed bumps and traffic lights. It's probably a 20minute walk without rushing. (No, there's no walking path to cut through. They're all solid walls with electric fences above them.) </TEXT>
