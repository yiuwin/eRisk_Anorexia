	<TEXT> I've been replacing my normal sugar with this stuff. What's your opinion on this in the long run? Is it ok? Is it terrible? People who have been on their weight loss journeys for a while now and have been eating low sugar items, what have been the effects?

	<TITLE> [NSV] 3 weeks of working out and eating better - I've lost a fat roll on my back! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-30 23:15:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started my journey early January and I've been hitting the gym 2-3 times a week, and logging everything into MyFitnessPal. I've been a tiny bit discouraged in that the scale hasn't gone down has much as I hoped. People have told me not to worry about that, as I've mainly been lifting, and not doing cardio as much.

Anyway, today, I had a shower to get ready for work and my partner was so surprised and said my back looked different. I got her to take a picture to compare, sure enough, one roll is gone! I can't believe it, after 3 weeks! 

Maybe NSFW because I'm in my undieroos.

	<TEXT> This. My PT is the best money I've spent. She's very motivating, teaches me correct technique, checks how I'm feeling the next days after a hard workout, reviews my food (I send her myfitness pal weekly reports), comes and says hello to me at the gym when I'm working out on my own, and for me personally, the best thing is that I don't want to let her down. Every time I go to eat something bad, I think "hmm, I'll have to put that into MFP, and she's going to see it". So I don't eat it. Overall, she keeps me motivated and i look forward to my sessions. </TEXT>

I've had this on my elbow for at least a month. I just thought it was a fungus so I used a fungus cream but it hasn't gone away. I also have a smaller mark on my stomach that came about at the same time. Occasionally they are itchy, but no other pain.

I'm female, 31, have dark skin (Indian heritage). I work in an office so I'm not in the sun much. No history of cancer in my family that I know of. I'm a bit overweight but for the past month, I've been eating better, going to the gym and I've lost a bit of weight. No other lifestyle changes besides that. No new soaps, creams or anything. </TEXT>
