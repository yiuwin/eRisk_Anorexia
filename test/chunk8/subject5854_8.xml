	<TEXT> I think it just broke down completely, Anthony started up the video podcast that [started doing very well (this was posted 1 week before the Times Square incident)](https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/2a0hk9/live_from_the_compound_is_now_the_1_most_popular/?ref=search_posts) and I'm sure that gave him a nothing to lose attitude about O A. He probably just didn't care anymore. At the same time, a lot of that is on Opie for being a total nightmare of a human being to work with. The brand was totally sullied the moment everyone realized Ant wasn't going to be coming back to Sirius XM.

I think if we are choosing it's probably Anthony with all the bad headlines and building a reputation of being a ne'er do well, the more shit he got into the less of a chance O A would ever come back on a big platform. At the same time though, Opie is the reason that the show could never truly be good again. He's the one that tried some bullshit negotiation antics and had it backfire on him, ruined the relationship with Jim and made it so there's very little chance we ever get O A w/ J again.

Then again though, 'Cellar Crowd' was the real reason O A was ever good. There's very few moments that can be considered the best O A moments with only Opie and Anthony in studio. All the biggest draw was always from whatever 4th/5th mic they'd be having in that day and the chemustree that Anthony Jim and *insert 4th/5th mics here* had in studio. That being said, most of the biggest and best 4th/5th mics to be inserted have all moved way on, either by location, fame, death, or changing their whole public persona (Louis CK). The only ones who are really around anymore are Bobby and Nick. Both of whom had some great moments on O A and were a part of some great stuff, but without Burr, Louis, Patrice, Otto, and others, the show would never and will never live up to what it used to be even if it was to come back with all 3 members tomorrow </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of what UFC does or encourages nowadays with tons of press coverage is designed to sell fights, all of that WWE-esque drama before the fights, hyping up certain fighters like they're gods, they try to make every fight seem like a big grudge match showdown to sell it. I doubt Rogan gets commission on fight sales but he's certainly a good little employee about all of the hype stuff. They love the fact he has a bigtime podcast that reaches a lot of people who aren't that into UFC and I'm sure he knows that, so he plays into the marketing game for increased job security </TEXT>

Brother Joe definitely deserves his own section for this year in review. Stuff like /u/shitlord_cuntdick 's [Brother Joe: A Racist Compendium](https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/4aqt8j/brother_joe_cumia_a_racist_compendium/) and all of the threads where various tour dates were announced as cancelled etc, if you're out there and  you posted any of these add a link here and we can get the Bro Joe War Memorial section going

This is a pat-yourself-on-the-back friendly thread, posts like /u/shitlord_cuntdick aren't few and far between, these are the heart and soul of our entertainment here when there's nothing to talk about with any of the shows etc. and chances are you probably remember them better than anyone else, so anyone who had a post/thread that was worth a damn, please add it in for enjoyment! </TEXT>

#Overview

Another year for the dead show that won't quite die. We came into January riding high on an eventful December, which brought us the Opie vs. Jimmy "We're not Close" fight, Greggshells II complete with T-shirts, Opie Poker Chips, then right into the Anthony vs. Dani Periscope incident, then Brother Joe throwing himself into the fray with several Facebook rants and Twitter posts directed at the subreddit.

December led us into a winter-long internets war against Anthony and Joe Cumia. Anthony threatened to dox a Panera employee and Joe deployed the feared SAMCRO motorcycle gang, but despite their efforts, their battle with /r/opieandanthony ended in a devastating defeat.  Left in the wake of the conflict were a string of cancelled 2U gigs, the discovery of Sue Lightning, and a few questionable favorited Vine posts by Anthony brought to light. Danny appeared then disappeared, Norton took a few hits between Amy Schumer and the Chip Cartoon, The Anthony Cumia Network became Compound Media and lost Legion of Skanks (and Rat), Anthony went off to rehab, tension between Opie and Jim on D.L. Hughely, culminating in the ousting of Opie from mornings and the birth of the Jim   Sam Show, with Opie kicking and screaming and writing in the sand along the way. Opie made up with Anthony, Nancy Grace walked, Ken Bone got ramoned, and not a single Rich Vos gig went by unplugged. 2017 has a LOT to live up to....

	<TEXT> That was the funniest thing about this. None of this had left the little CyTube/Discord world and it never would have, no one was planning to bring it outside of that. spinuch came in the next day and saw someone was using the handle Brian_Gilgore, panicked and then came here to post his manifesto to a bunch of people who had no idea wtf he was talking about

It's great because spinuch has been so incredibly paranoid about giving away anything at all about himself as if the subreddit is a bunch of maniacal serial killers, I was pestering him to let me hear his podcast for the past 3 months and if he did I had no plans to tell anyone else or post it, I was just curious cause he'd mention it in passing every now and then when there was barely anyone around... GRIZx outted him to only a couple of people, jimc0zad found the twitter connected to the soundcloud, jokes and loffs were had, and then it was pretty much over with... then paranoid spinuch blew up his own spot in the grandest way possible </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I agree, for me Adderall after the tolerance builds up kind of stinks. It stops getting me all hyped and motivated and starts just making me moody and randomly pissed off. Modafinil gets a little weaker after tolerance builds but it still always does what it's supposed to do. 

Also yeah that was the biggest reason I stopped Adderall, trying to find it without a script its a bitch and a half. Almost everyone who has a scrip doesn't want to sell it and the ones who do want to make a bunch of money off of it. Anyone who sells it at a good price has already sold their entire supply within like 3 days of getting it. Ordering modaf is a breeze, I'm just waiting for an order to get seized by customs but it's never happened once in 5 or 6 orders I've gotten </TEXT>

Now he's stuck with a bunch of peoples money and hes forced to do something he knows is going to be god awful. It hurts his reputation the longer he holds onto the money and it will hurt it even more when he actually releases a finished product

I bet the response to the first episodes has made him so weary of it being bad and he's trying so hard to write a script that will win people back over... at this point though he should just put something together, release it, take the murdering hes going to get and move on. There is virtually no possibility whatsoever it's going to get a positive response. Just get it over with </TEXT>

I'm guessing if so it would be on this channel? https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN8KFStzAWT1Bu-JYAq8nwg

Hopefully there is a closure to it either him officially getting booted from the show or he comes back on and they hash things out. 

I have the incident + extended version with them talking about it after, then all clips of both of them on different shows talking about it, if we get a closure thing to it today or sometime soon I'll make a video similar to Anthony Cumia vs. Joe DeRosa Downfall Saga that has them all in order </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Review] Kaizen by So Yum - donut, toffee, roasted almond, and chocolate frosting drizzle </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-18 07:18:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just grabbed a bottle of this at the store, didn't see a review on it here yet. I'm vaping it at 80w with a brand new .2 coil on a Cleito. Nicotene level is 6mg. There is no throat hit but it's also not a weak nicotine juice, the overall body of the juice and vapor pull are both very well done.

The overall flavor is good, nothing is bad-tasting about it at all and I'll definitely finish it, but it's not really as complex as the flavor profile might seem. The two weakest flavors are by far the donut/pastry and the chocolate drizzle flavors. The toffee and toasted almond completely overpower them and neutralize the taste of chocolate significantly in it. I can very faintly taste a vague chocolate flavor on the end of the exhale, but I've had some other chocolate flavors like Nutter Finger/Reese's Dream that do chocolate much better. The donut flavor, or any pastry taste, I really do not pick up at all. It seems to me like a good and distinct donut/pastry has been really hard to achieve especially after the industry's diacetyl purge a couple years ago, since that was the ingredient that truly brought out that disctinct fresh and doughy pastry taste. 

With the donut taste nowhere to be found, and the overpowering toffee/roasted almond neutralizing the flavor of chocolate, what you end up with tastes essentially something like like toasted caramel or like those candied peanuts you can find in the nut isle or at street carts in Manhattan. It's pretty delicious and the "roasted" part of the almond flavor really puts it all together with a savory finish. All I would say is that if you are thinking of buying this juice primarily for the chocolate taste, there are juices that pull off a sweet, rich, deep heavy chocolate flavor better than this Kaizen flavor in terms of chocolate flavors. Same goes for the donut flavor, the toffee/nut make it almost non-existent. BUT overall this juice is really nice, it's tasty, and if you're interested in the toffee and/or the toasted almond, or you're just looking for a nice semi-sweet desert flavor that goes great with coffee in the morning, it'll do the job well. It's not overly sweet either so it's not one that gets to be too much after a few puffs, if you're a dessert fan and the flavor clicks with you it'd be pretty easy to use as an ADV. 

Overall -- 7/10, IMO it wasn't totally accurate to how it's described, but it tastes very nice just for what it is. Anyone else give this one a try yet? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The black dude on this had a career last over a decade, exiled LL Cool J out of hip hop for good, got in feuds with Eminem, release more than 10 albums, singles that charted on top 50 the Billboard Top 200 R B/Hip-hop, included on multiple top rappers/top lyricists of all time lists in different magazines/websites

Then he had his entire legacy permanently tarnished and his reputation severely damaged until the rest of time because of the last 2 minutes of video footage in this clip. Regardless of everything he has accomplished, nobody brings his name up anymore in any conversation without it eventually getting mentioned that this happened

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZVMvxYQgdc

But Mike Lawrence works really really hard and these highly revered, legendary roast battles in a tiny NYC club featuring amateur part time comedians is serious business. Roastmasters NYC on YouTube is an anchor of the comedy business! Letting a video like this get in the hands of the public would change the game. Do you want to see the entire industry shaken to its very foundation? Bury that fucking tape. Plus Mike's manager said so </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mike fucking killed it. Zac did better.

Dude we all know if this sentence was actually true, it would be online right now, the vast majority of all the viewers would not be shitting on Mike, they would just be enjoying a great battle all around. There'd be a few trolls buried in the comments who would be trying to rub it in Mike's face as there always is on any battle, but the consensus would just be that it was just an awesome battle to watch. You know this and we know this, there's no reason to bullshit people and do damage control. The fact is that Mike did not do well.

You keep bringing money into this but that really has nothing to do with it. The truth is that Mike has become so heavily invested in the whole concept of roast battles that inside his own head he started imagine all this Roast Battle stuff as his "lane" and what he can build the next few years of his career around. You're helping him do that.

Like you just said, he's putting so much work into it, and because of all that constant focus on roast battles he picked up a bad case of tunnel vision. He got caught up in it and it caused him to forget he's a full fledged standup comedian and roast battles is a side dish. 

But once the tournament got picked up by CC, Lawrence saw an opportunity to turn roast battles into the entree, he's thinking roast battles could be a product, The Stand could be a brand, and in order to build a career for himself in that, he wants to attach himself to that brand and be the face of it. You say he's working for free but he doesn't see it that way, he sees this all as an investment that he wants a return in.

However the battle with Zach fucked all that up and put him at risk. After all, how can he attach himself to the brand and be the face of The Stand NYC Roast Battles when there's a video of him getting decimated by one of the guys who's just going to be a contestant? It fucks up the whole image Mike is trying to maintain right now, it undermines all his aspiration to be seen as the big guy roast battle king of the East Coast NYC side.

If this Roast Battles 'product' ever catches on, new viewers and new fans from the CC show can all go on the internet and see this Mike Lawrence guy, who's supposed to be known as the big made man champion of NYC getting destroyed by Amico, a lowly contestant. It shatters the reputation Mike Lawrence is trying to manufacture for himself right now and puts him at risk for losing the entire facade he's working so hard to build and maintain, even if it's all fake and he's really not the king of NYC roast battles or the true champion at all. He believes there's a nice payday and a career path ahead of him with all this stuff and he doesn't want the actual truth or reality getting in the way of that, especially not when it comes in the form of permanent, timeless video evidence.

He's a slithering worm of a man, and lucky for him he has people like you to act as a pawn. A good guy with too much naivety, who treats his 'friends' with a blind and unquestioning loyalty that someone like Mike Lawrence can easily manipulate into serving his own ends. He's well on his way to a successful career in showbusiness! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fawk yeah that was good. I got one for ya

So this black kid was playing in the kitchen right..

He accidentally knocked a bag of flour off the shelf and it went all over him.

His mom came in the kitchen and he decided to make a joke of it. "Look Mom, I'm white!" he said.

His mom slapped him across the cheek. "I can't believe you just said that boy, go tell your father what you just said."

Surprised and a little hurt, he walked over to his Dad in the TV room and said "Hey look Dad... I'm white!"

When his Dad heard that, he flat out punched the kid. Square in the face. The kid was shocked and confused. The Dad said "Boy that's the worst shit I've ever heard, go and show your grandma what you did and tell her what you said.

So the kid begrudgingly walked upstairs and walked into his Grandma's bedroom. "Hey Grandma look, I'm white..."

...and his Grandma just pummeled him. Relentlessly. So hard that both the kids' parents had came upstairs to break up the beating.

They all stood around him and asked him "Yeah well how do you feel about making that joke now?"

The kid just looked up at them and said "...Well I've only been white for 10 minutes, and I hate all you niggers already!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you read or listened to what his Subscribers Only shows are? If not, I checked to see if this was a normal thing, making some interviews/bigname people premium only but:

- "I got in a fight with my wife, here's my rant" 

- "My wife found this part of my act offensive, here's my rant"

- "Let me tell you about my morning routine" 

- "My wife got in a car accident, here's the story"

- "Women blame their boyfriends/husbands for so many things but it's really their father's fault"

That's every subscribers only episode he's released

There has never once been an actual guest on his subscribers only show, all of his guests have been on the free show. But if you want to believe this is some type of timing issue or coincidence that the only recognizable big name big audience guests he's ever gotten magically end up being a premium only show that's all you

with the responsibility to subscribers, how could it be about that, it wouldn't make a difference for any subscriber if it was free or subscription only, they're going to be able to see it either way. It's Joe Matarese trying to turn Ant + Norton + Artie together, which is something people want to hear purely because of Ant + Norton + Artie, into a payday for Joe Matarese. </TEXT>

Not to mention teasing them with a "Recap" of it for free haha. What a guy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This dude is a fucking slimeball. He hasn't posted the video of this yet. He has now said that he's not even going to release the audio to anyone but his monthly subscribers. Piece of shit move, I went back and checked and he's never done anything like this with his monthly subscriber shows, they're all just dumb rants and Q A shows. When this video gets posted of Anthony Artie and Jim I'm sure it will surface around here. I know a guy who knows a guy

So I'd recommend **not** signing up for his dumb podcast just to be able to hear 3 people who will never be on it again. He's whoring out the names of people who are supposedly friends of his,  Anthony Artie and Jimmy, just so he can walk around and collect $3 bucks from everyone who has no choice but to blindly subscribe to his podcast, people who have absolutely no interest in him and wouldn't care less if he was not even on the stage for this podcast, who are only interested in hearing Anthony Jim and Artie together, not interested in Joe Matarese.

At first he implied that he was going to release the audio for free as usual but supposedly he just wrote a note to his subscribers that "tell your friends if they want to hear it they have to sign up for the monthly subscription or they're shit out of luck". 


Overall just a really sleazy move that only a lowly dirtbag swindler type of person would even think about doing, let alone actually go through with it and go so far as to hold out on his regular listeners and not even release the audio of the show on his regular podcast while keeping the video for subscribers only (which wouldn't be that big a deal). This dude finally gets the first guest booking where people actually recognize the names and would be interested in listening, and then he holds that shit over everyones head telling them to blindly pay him a monthly subscription, never having done anything like that with guests in the past, that's some greedy opportunistic scumbaggery, and I think that needs some *fixing*  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't even matter wo Sager is or what he did, this sensitive type of reaction where someone hears something that rubs them the wrong way and then writes some complaint about it, was a recurrent point O A would make and those people would get ripped on endlessly over the years. The show, the offshoots shows, and this whole culture that has come out of it here was always designed around being irreverant, critical, making fun of things, nothing off limits, but then you have people who love it until something gets hit that offends them and then all of a sudden they get their pantaloons in a bundle 

Can't burn the candle at both ends, listening to an irreverant comedy show and laughing when they shit on whatever's the topic of the week but then get all up in a huff when they finally hit something in your corner </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did someone ask about adderall vs. modafinil but delete it? If you read this, it's comparable but definitely not in the same league in terms of strength and that whole God-like feeling amphetamines can give off. There's some advantages and disadvantages to that depending on how you look at it though. It makes me into a wordy fuck but Adderall used to do that too. 

Adderall used to also take my low end of type A, moderately skew to type A but not out of hand personality type and ramp that shit up to full on next level type A asshole douche with no remorse level, this can be great in some circumstances but mostly I would just completely lose my sensitivity to others' emotions and talk to people like they're objects, lose my filter and a few times I was a dick in group projects at school etc. treating my group like Vin Diesel treats his employees in Boiler Room when it's a meaningless fucking geography powerpoint we're doing. I needed to chill but I was too buzzed out to realize this isn't an investment firm we're building here. Modafinil will pep you up, get you really into things, still ramp up the type A in you a bit, but not to the point where you lose your ability to empathize and become a hyped up fast talking robotic cunt

Some people have gotten the impression modafinil is in that whole group with shit like Alpha Brain and herbal supplements etc. It's nothing like those, it's actually a legitimate mind altering drug that you can feel working with no doubt about whether or not theres some type of placebo going on. If you take enough of it you'll get that teeth chattering, sweating, no eating feeling of amphetamines and you can stay wide awake for a long time, but still, one would have to really understand what adderall feels like and then try some modafinil to truly see what modaf is lacking and the differences between the two are, and decide whether those differences actually work in your favor or not </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My back was totally fucked up for awhile and Kratom helped a ton, weird gnawing pain that would constantly distract me and was driving me totally insane but kratom took the bite off of it, and through that the stress went down, then the inflammation went down because of less stress, then I could crack my whole back back into place. Almost all my shit is caused my inflammation and misalignment which created these big ass muscle knots.
Shit load of hiking days over this summer and some acupuncture to break up the knots and I'm almost fully back to normal. Kratom was the thing that made it so that the pain didnt drive me insane asylum crazy or deep into depression. 

So I'm definitely more of the AKA woman's side. That whole making it illegal thing has sort of passed us by at least for now, but it was some total horse shit, I guess kratom was growing as a cheap, legal, and safe method for DIY opiate recovery and the whole racket where you go to state funded rehab facility, get some state funded methadone, get some state funded subutex, visit these state funded NA meetings didn't want any competition. The dangerous things with kratom is when you buy it from commie Chinese scumbags who have some weird methods of getting it into branded mass production for headshops etc. Internet is the way to go.

I've completely abused the shit out of it and had to go through a full withdrawal thing after months of heavy use, shoveling down tablespoons all day long, way too much. Stopped cold turkey this summer and all the kratom caused was feeling achey and having a tough time getting a peaceful restful sleep for about 10 days. Nothing crazy lock-me-in-a-room shit like opiate withdrawal. Didn't stop my life in its tracks. I've heard the biggest factor in that DEA move was that some company just took out a patent on the two active 'molecules' or something that's in kratom and are in R D for turning it into a pill. </TEXT>

My dreams were getting so unbelievably vivd but they are not normal or cohesive at all... then the sleep paralysis thing sometimes starts working its way into the context of the dream for me. I'm doing about 2 times a week but several weeks 3, but working in some 1 or none weeks too cause I don't want to get hooked again You're right the benefts are awesome but it's some weird stuff with the sleep changes, not a big fan of sporadically getting sleep paralysis </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How much phenibut do you take per day? I'll let you know my situation with it, if you're already headed down this type of road pull out man, I'll describe it but the key to remember is it's nothing like any withdrawal youve ever seen in the movies or any type of stereotypical cliche phamaceutical opiate/benzo withdrawal (but I only know that secondhand from trading story details and timelines and shit with my friend who was actually into pharma pill popping). Also compared to the horror novel worthy posts people have written about phenibut withdrawal, it was way more manageable and generally pretty tame than I had expected. Most annoying part is that it's unpredictable and it just drags on annoyingly for awhile til finally one morning its just totally gone for good.

The first time I ever got into any of these things I figured the withdrawal stories were a bunch of kids being dramatic and writing horror stories in the middle of their withdrawal. I was taking way too much back then, like 2-3g of phenibut per day for probably around 8 months straight. Tablespoon after tablespoon of kratom every couple hours per day which later doing the math was somewhere around 35-45g a day on average.

 I really had absolutely no "respect" for it at all, just thought it was like a tealeaf that makes you feel good, and I stayed on the Phenibut for a lot longer than I actually wanted to simply because of all the crazy withdrawal stories, after awhile I didn't want to deal with all that especially during the summer.  I've never been an opiate user especially not an opiate addict so I don't really know what that's like, and I'm not at all a fan of benzos either they just don't do it for me. For some reason Phenibut I like because it gives that feeling that's kind of hard to describe, it's like up and down at the same time, chills your brain out just enough without dumbing it down, like greasing up an engine. I've still never taken extracts but will probably try them sometime. 

Anyways the withdrawal sucked extra because I actually was taking the kratom for some terrible back issues. I wanted to see what cutting it completely out would feel like and I was going to be travelling a lot and didn't want to have to figure out all the shit with planes and getting it here and there. Back then I was also still a daily weed smoker for a little over 10 years (28 now) and wanted to drop that habit too. So stupidly enough I just said fuck it and quit cold turkey all on the same day. No tapers just shut it all down, phenibut, kratom, and weed all at the same time. What a beautiful symphony of garbage I felt like, everything from irritableness and moodswings to sleeplessness, restlessness, to spikes of inflammation and straight pain in my back. It was hard to tell what was causing what feeling or which direction anything was coming from like getting punched in the dark by 3 different midgets. 


However that being said, it was not nearly as bad as a lot of the stuff I'd read online and it wasn't as bad as I had actually been expecting it to be based on the volume of shit I was taking in. 

If you're anything like me though, don't trust what your body is telling you at first, none of the effects of any of the stuff kicked in until like 3 days after I stopped. I seriously thought 'holy shit that was the biggest joke of my life that was nothing' and then just as I was getting settled into that everything started up. Out of anything the mood swings were the most annoying and I think they were mostly from the phenibut. They sucked and since I don't have experience with any benzos or opiates etc it was really eye opening and mildly disturbing with phenibut, that's when I learned exactly how much of a true lack of control I actually have on my mind, my thought patterns, moods, and learned just how much my entire mentality depends on all the 'chemicals' to be in order in there, those GABA receptors aint nothing to  fuck with. There's no nifty mental tricks or ways to dodge it or anything like that, no breathing control games, no escape, my brain basically told me you're going to feel deeply deeply shitty in a way that is not debilitating, comes and goes in unpredictable waves, but will still stab straight to the core of how your mind operates to make you feel emo and depressed as a bitch, then all of a sudden gone. Couple hours feeling life youre stuck in some kind of roid rage, then gone like that. Plenty of time where you get a rest and and feel sort of baseline but until that shits totally out of your system you still have this subtle invisible rain cloud in your head, hardly even noticeable until it finally goes away, then I remembered what it was actually like just to feel healthy and normal, that was a nice surprise.

About 10 days I stopped feeling all achey and restless and my inflamattion went down a shit ton, so that I'm pretty sure was the kratom finishing up. About 12-14 days I woke up one day and actually just felt totally myself again, like my brain was going to let me be happy or relaxed or just whatever, no swings or no subtle mental raincloud over every moment. I had actually forgotten what that feeling felt like, I think what I was experiencing that morning was my brain finally reached its healthy baseline balance and started regulating either serotonin and/or dopamine levels again. I honestly don't remember it being a slow progress towards feeling normal. It was more like that subtle black cloud thing kept getting less and less 'powerful' then one day poof it was gone.

Good luck if you already have things under control with it good for you. My biggest sin was not taking anyone's internet stories or even those websites that explain side effects seriously whatsoever, figured this is a legal drug you can just buy in big cheap quantities off the internet, these dudes claiming they had a terrible withdrawal are dramatic pussies, nothings gonna happen and if it does it'll be mild at best' until it was too late and I had to deal with a couple shitty weeks. </TEXT>
