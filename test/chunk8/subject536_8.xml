	<TEXT> It's a good feeling isn't it!? Congrats! Not having my thighs touch has made my inner thighs really sensitive, which isn't necessarily bad but it's kind of weird. Have you noticed that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn good job! Though I guess it became obvious when I confirmed that two others were true. 
It was only $5 and I'm not the one who got my third grade teacher fired, his 16 y/o gf did! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really like sleeping. But I find no matter what time I go to bed, I wake up at around the same time anyway. So, that's a bummer. I don't get a lot of sleep, and I'm usually up in the morning. There's something I just really prefer about the bright hours of the day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favorite quotes would be...
"Everything is interesting if you pay attention" I think this is true, however, I'm awful at paying attention to things so this really isn't a quote I feel I have the right to apply/say.
This next one is going to make me sound so lame but there's this one part in my favorite anime where a girl is yelling at someone and tells him, "You're all you've got and you never even learned to like yourself?!" and that one really resonated with me. I think liking yourself is the first step towards anything. And I mean, you are all you got, might as well make peace with yourself.
There's also this quote from some awful book I had to be read in the sixth grade. I thought the name was Finding Bell Prater or something like that but I haven't been able to find it. Anyway there's this really pretty little girl with gorgeous long hair and in one scene she gets really angry and cuts it all off and says something along the lines of "I don't want to be pretty and nice! I want to be evil and ugly!" I don't know why, but that stood out to me a lot.

EDIT
Also, I like the quote "If better is possible good is not enough" because I love progress, though I think this quote can be applied in very unhealthy ways too.
There's also something Tyra Banks said, and it was like "It doesn't matter how passionate you are, someone has to choose you." Just wanting something isn't enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. I've had to run from the police before
2. I conned a girl out of $20 in the 9th grade by telling her I had information on a teacher she hated. After she gave the money I made up lies about him.
3. I set my bathroom on fire once
4. I cut a chunk of my hand off while cooking and didn't notice until a good two or three minutes later.
5. I got my third grade teacher fired </TEXT>
