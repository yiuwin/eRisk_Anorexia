	<TEXT> Okay I will give you your first point, he should be more critical of Trump and the Republicans, though maybe he feels that there is plenty of mediums that do that already. But still, I personally was against Hillary and I liked Trump, so I don't like it when his followers and pseudo followers pretend he is doing everything like he promised. 

 Oh, come on. The vast majority of the folks on the left don't act like this. I find it hard to take criticisms like this seriously when I hear comments like this.

Sorry but by now there is so many videos and compilations, and tweets, were the American "left" is behaving like that. Especially in universities. They are still not a majority, but a significant minority I would say. I don't think there is an equivalent of that on the right wing side in US or rather there is but in a negligent number, however other countries have disgusting right wingers too.

 I disagree with you 100% here; you, and you alone, should be prepared to present supporting evidence when making a positive claim. It's not just you, it's everyone. If I make a positive claim then I damn well should be prepared to back it up with evidence. As Carl Sagan said, "Positive claims require positive evidence. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."

Well there is nothing much to add here, except again, you are gonna get nowhere in a conversation like that. You will never get past the smallest point, because everybody will start saying "actually a study" and it will go into nowhere... I prefer to hear the claim and later research in the comfort of my home when I have the time, energy and if I care about the issue in the first place.

	<TITLE> I feel like, that either I or this sub miss the point of Rubin Report. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-03 17:59:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some background first, I am a none-American so  I hate and despise the two party dictatorship US has, I hate how it poisons and divides people and thanks to the internet its infecting rest of the world, however that goes both ways which is where Rubin comes in. I get the impression that this sub expects Rubin to spew the same shit every Democrat does, and that he viciously attacks his right wing guests. That really doesn't make sense to me when we talk about the same Dave Rubin I have been watching. That's a problem with reddit in general, honestly for some reason its overflown with typical democrat thoughts, I am not saying they are worse than their Republican equivalent, but they are simply more prevalent on reddit, which makes discussion difficult.

So, I started watching Rubin around the time he had S.Harris and Milo on, so I do not really much know about him before that and honestly don't care. I doubt he is a war criminal or a serial rapist.

Anyway, to me Rubin was all about letting someone speak in a comfortable atmosphere, he was the antithesis on disgusting American shows where a host assaults his guests(Carlson/Maher) and in the end you mostly get nothing, just a bunch of angry people. With Rubin the guest cannot claim they were cornered, that somebody put words in their mouth, that they were forced to rush, yada yada yada... You get their best, and if you are not down with them, that's cool. But you do not have to be a screeching bitch about it, on the contrary, you should feel satisfied, since they gave you their best and you still find them unappealing.He doesn't dehumanize his guests, on the contrary he lets them sound like a human that has certain views and can explain why they have them. 

That doesn't make him a journalist, to me he is a talk show host, or something like that. He just lets people express. 

The second reason why I like him is that he has shown that there is still hope for liberals, which I guess I would define myself as. That there are still liberals who will not yell "triggered" in the vicinity of someone with god forbid, different views than him. 
Rubin showed me that not(yet) all liberals are [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy6spOAbxhg) 

The third reason is, to come back on the beginning on my post, through his interviews he shows the how idiotic the right/left thing is and how it doesn't work anymore. I think his show lets people get comfortable into their own ideas and that they shouldn't choose one stupid side over the other. Its just unbelievable to me that somehow my views on gay marriage and my views on healthcare have to align. Or that if I am against over taxation that somehow that makes me a Christian bible sucker. That if I get offended by something that makes me a libtard bitch  etc...

Now it seems to me the issue arises from the abundance of right wing guests that Rubin has, and that somehow makes him a right wing conservative (yes he was called that). Well I think that be explained with several reasons.

- He wants people with really different views from him, that usually means "right wing". Yes he has guests with similar opinions, but they are in the minority.

- The far right "left" won't come on his show, its as simple as that. That's why I liked Rubin, he was a leftist that was willing to sit down and let somebody else explain him what and why do they think. I think Rubin is a huge thorn in the side of regressives, sjws, progresives whatever... He is a really nice guy that likes to chat with people about every idea, is not racist, is not sexist and is a homosexual. That just doesn't fit their agenda. Just look how long it took for somebody to dare to bring Milo on a leftist show.

- Patreon, this is the only one that has me worried, if Rubin's Patrons are indeed all narrow minded right wingers, and he cannot resist the sweet dough, yeah that is worrying. But I think its still early to cry wolf. 

Another thing people on reddit seem to expect is that people talking on the internet have this "responsibility" to be a book. Why I mean to say is that if they make some claim they are supposed to make a bunch of citations as for why that works. 
Well good luck having a good flowing conversation with that. Look if you are dumb enough to take somebody's claim at face value, that's you and there is no helping you. The people on the internet are not obligated to save you from your stupidity. Basically these conversations should be the springboard for forming or shifting your opinion, they shouldn't be the final word.

In essence I do not believe people's minds are a spectrum of left-right, but that ideas and thoughts are like floating bubbles, and that any kind of bubble can converge with another. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Stalkermod.ru](http://stalkermod.ru/) seems like a treasure trove of mods, but a lot of them seem to insist that you cannot use the Steam or the GOG ver. for the mod. Which is basically saying, you need to pirate the game. 

First, why is that the case with Stalker games, what did GOG and Steam do to them? I pretty much gave up on my Steam stalkers, they are there just as a proof of me giving money.

Second, do you have to have a "russian" ver. of the games to run these Russian mods? Do I have to download specifically a Russian pirated game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some examples of non-aaa games with the scale of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. that have models for both males and females with as many variables as would be needed would be nice.

The first Witcher game? Rysen games? Vampire the Masquerade? Demon's Souls? I would venture to say all these games had  roughly the same budget and less experienced developers (in the genre of the game) then GSC when they came to CoP.


I am getting tired of writing this. Women do not have to be stalkers, I am saying where are the scientists, bartenders, traders, medics, prostitutes... And as I mentioned also, women on their own accord are going to fight ISIS, so even that is plausible. Of course it would be dumb that every second stalker would be a women, but one in 1/10? Why not?

 As for Roadside Picnic, yeah they're motivated by their families, but do their wives also go into the zone? :)

Yes, but that's why I am saying, why aren't stalkers talking about that stuff? Just think about, how many voice or text lines is any stalker talking about something that has to do with a woman? 

Its just weird, you would think when they are sitting next to the campfire, they would reminisce. Again mate, this isn't a radical notion, way to many games have done this. And I would bet money that if Stalker 2 came out, there would be women in some shape or form.

Ok, I am fine with that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but see, jamming, accurate ballistics, hunger mechanics, getting locations right, etc., are all vital to the game's core. Without them S.T.A.L.K.E.R. just isn't S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

I'll give you that, that was a bad example but its obviously shows the direction of the games. But I mentioned before, they do other things to make the games immersive, to make it feel like it really happened. Having a few females would have not killed all the games. 

OMG Why is this such a radical notion to Stalker fans? That you have a bartender npc with tits!

I read the Roadside Picnic, there is a lot of things that divulges from the lore in the games. And the main character as his partner and rival, both have wives and daughters. And both of them are "stalking" and thinking/speaking about them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Making a new character, female or otherwise takes time. A lot of it.
You need not only create the mesh, but also texture variables for low, medium, and high settings, then map lighting and shaders to it with, again, respective low, medium and high settings. Afterwards comes creating variables for the factions and for each and every piece of armor/clothing. Even further comes the fact that they'd then need to hire voice actresses for the characters, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games actually use voices to distinguish faction members really well, so the time and money it'd take to do this would also not be small.

Yet so many NON-AAA games have them, very interesting. And you know they just not voice them? Also, as I mentioned they do not have to be stalkers. They could be mute NPCs, like traders or scientists or doctors. 

Add to this that SoC was already in development hell for quite some time before release

That's why I mentioned all the games, not just SoC. SoC sold over 2m, I think that would justify more than enough budget to get a few female voice actors. Besides they do not have to bring the most expensive ones.
Early Dark Souls games are not Activision/EA flagships, yet they have fantastic voice actors.
 

and adding in females for "muh diversity" would've been a massively stupid way of using their time. Then also read Roadside Picnic and get an idea of how faithful they were trying to be to the original material.

And here its painfully obvious that you didn't read what I wrote in the OP. Once again, I very clearly stated, that I do not want them to do it like Bioware who are "muh diversity" poster boys. I just based off on our own reality and how it works, and how it doesn't make sense that its such a sausage fest. 

I've also read Roadside picnic, and lots of Stalkers there including the FUCKING PROTAGONIST and the most WEALTHIEST STALKER are motivated by their family. Which means they spend a lot of time with their thoughts and words about their family, who happen to have females! Yes human race has females! And all of that was in my OP, I mentioned how it was weird that stalkers so rarely talk about anything that might involve the existence of females in human race. 

Then in Roadside picnic there are no militaristic organizations having thousands of members and bases in the middle of the zone, there is no C-Conscience, the number of stalkers is dramatically lower etc... What I am saying is they are not using the novel's lore 1/1.

	<TEXT> So guns jamming, having to eat food, using medkits bandages, enemy ai being cunning is done in the name of realism. Seriously, developers went to fucking Chernobyl, Pripyat, Limansk etc... to take pictures and recreate those areas so it would feel real, but having one woman was too much work? Asking for that is petty, in three games they couldn't make a bartender woman in Skadovsk or a brothel? Just look at Metro, they really brought the Metro world to life in a way that it makes sense, women aren't showed in and forced down your throat as badass feminist or something.

I'm just saying, it makes the world feel weird. And it wouldn't hurt the games, if done properly.

Witcher 1 has female models, Witcher 1 who had one of the most messed up developments, and maybe even less experience with games than GSC. Risen games have them, Vampire the Masquerade has them... Common man, you do not need EA games to finance this.

	<TEXT> It means they have contacts and have worked with people who did those things. Its just not that hard. 

So many games with good mod support start dishing out new models with time. I just refuse to believe that if we count the time from SoC was started to develop, so early 2000's to CoP, that GSC had no time or resources to make like one female character. I mean that's insane.

Just think about how many games have female models, why would that be so fucking hard!?

Stalker Mod, Darkest Time has a female character! If moders can do it, developers can. </TEXT>

I do gotta say AP-pro forums, are a clusterfuck. Like in the OP there is a link for Arsenal Overhaul AO_for_CoM_1.1.1, but accidentally, I opened a link that seems to be a guide about some uniforms sub-mod, and in there it had a link for 
AO_for_CoM_1.2.

Also the MODDB page is full of the author posting links and explanations and fixes, and its really starting to confuse me, why doesn't he compile it all in one file and explanation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is it irrelevant? You do realize women can get raped fighting ISIS or in any war? You do realize that men rape men? Especially when there is less women around.

Both CoD and BF have female characters in Single Player. And I think CoD has females in Multyplayer on same games as well. Sorry mate your reasoning that the females might get raped and therefore shouldn't exist is really odd and I hope its not GSC actual way of thinking. Once again, if everybody use that logic, we would not have any females in gaming, since most games feature dangerous situations or places. We wouldn't have Lara Croft, since she might get raped.

As a matter of fact, Metro games have female characters too, Metro:Last Light has one female sniper. 

Besides, rape seems inconsequential compared to falling prey to a bloodsucker.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Issues with Mutants(Lion Sounds), Mercenaries(All Russians) and people in the zone( No Females) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-30 13:19:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  I have played all the games, around 10+ mods and have watched a lot of youtube let's plays of lots of mods and here are some things I've noticed that I thought were only a problem or an annoyance in the first game, but later on it starts to be really jarring and I am befuddled how rarely this is noticed. It has most to do with lore and "common sense" or rather what we know about own world.

- Mutants, why do so many of them sound like lions? Have you noticed that? Because I have, and it really started to piss me off as the games progressed and mods rarely bothered to change that. 

Most annoying are of course snorks and bloodsuckers, who are obviously humanoid mutants, especially snorks, so why would they have lion roars? I mean just thinking about that for one second, makes you realize how dumb it is and what strange choice it is. I really struggle to imagine the sound designers of the games  insisting that they have a lion voice a human mutant. What could possible motivate them to have theses sounds? I mean couldn't they have taken an already established sound then changed it through various methods and then get a completely foreign authentic sound for these creatures? I thought that's how fictional creatures are given sound. At least by good sound designers. 

The reason why I noticed this quite early, is because once I downloaded a mod about werewolfs for Skyrim, and the mod creator offered several sound versions for the werewolf roar, he claimed one of them was visceral and bestial and it fits the theme really well. I used that one and when I played it well.... It was basically lion roars sampled over each other and amplified. I felt that second hand embarrassment at how cheesy and stupid it was, that's why I noticed these sounds when I heard snorks and bloodsuckers for the first time, they were not as bad as the Skyrim mod, but still it felt out of place.

Now the major problem with all of this is, is that Stalker mutants do not sound "iconic" or unique. Okay, some of the sounds are (Bloodsucker breathing, flesh) but they are not prevalent enough. It would be really cool if the games had their own recognizable sounds, that you could immediately identify as Stalker franchise.

- Mercenaries, have you noticed how the Mercenaries carry identical uniforms and speak either Russian or English with Russian accents, depending on the localization. They are all Caucasians too.
None of this makes sense to me, I mean again, you would think that Mercenaries would come from all parts of the world and speaking with all kinds of backgrounds and having all kinds of looks. What we get is a bunch of uniformed guys looking the same as the locals. Its really a missed opportunity to have some parts of the game feel exotic and foreign. 

Mercenaries would be way more exciting and interesting if they carried diverse suits (lots of mods adds new suits, so I do not see why would this be a prob. for the developers), if some of them had a few non-russian lines during combat, if they had various diverse names and looks(if you could see their face).

- People in the zone, have you noticed except a few specific models, there is only one body type of people in the zone? Like there is no variation among human bodies? I know Stalker is not the only one to suffer from this, but these games go to great length to achieve immersion and realistic feel, so these kinda gets jarring, especially when you enter the bar or Skadovsk and you see all these stalkers having the same height, build, muscles etc...



Then the people that you see their faces, are kinda boring. Which is especially egregious, since most of the people in the zone that you see their faces, would be bandits!

To many of them are clean shaven, or have generic mustache-beards. Also, they are usually specific models. Mount Blade games have these random face generators, so in non-specific game models you really see all kinds of diverse faces, like people with big beards and being bald, having mohawks, facial tattoos people with ugly scars, gingers, blond, charcoal black etc... 

Then we have to take into consideration the location which is a former Soviet republic. I personally have meet a lot of Ukrainans and Russians, and let me tell you they have very wide "palette" of looks. That's without the possibility of all non-Causacian types that we know live in nearby Russia and in former Soviet republics. The way I see it, it would make sense if there would be Turkmens, or Azeris or even Armenians in the zone. We have only Sultan though. 

With all these factors in mind, can you just imagine how much more awesome the bandits would be?

Then... have you noticed there isn't a single female character in the Stalker games? Like not a single fucking one. I would be hard pressed to remember any character even mentioning the existence of females in human species. Of course there must some mention, probably of a stalker talking about family or wife. Keep in mind, I do not understand Russian 100%, so I maybe missed some voiced lines. Even still.

Seriously when you think about this, it is really absurd. To me stalker hits this atmosphere, but sometimes the atmosphere lacks the "content" and it really shows in this aspect. I can easily imagine a bunch of stalkers sitting and talking about their mothers, sisters, girlfriends, wives, lovers, one night stand etc... Being sad or happy or melancholic. Telling how they fucked the shit out of some hot bitch or how they miss their sister's singing or anything. Or when you find a PDA, it wouldn't be odd that you find some mention of a loved or something like that. Then, to take it a step further, there could be women accompanying or simply working various stuff that non-stalkers do in the zone. Like bartenders, traders, scientist or in the military both as additional personnel and actual soldiers. And of course, prostitutes, I think there is no plausible explanation that there is no prostitutes in the zone. All stalkers are either homosex and we can't have that in Russian speaking sphere or stalkers make a vow of celibacy or they are chronic masturbators. Of course it would be nice if GSC had the balls to put in some subtle hints and or well written gay characters (but please no Bioware style crap).

Then we take it a step further, female fucking stalkers. Look there are women who on their own go to Syria or Iraq to fight ISIS, there are women in MMA, and there are women in the Israeli army and in Kurdish forces. I do not think it would be that a hard stretch to have some women in the Zone. Of course in the minority. The reasons for them being there could be varied as for any stalker, however now you can have stalkers in search for their loved one in the Zone, or couples that decided to go together in the Zone. That also means females getting pregnant...In the Zone.... You have to see the possibilities of this!

EDIT: I remembered, Elder Scrolls games have like Mount Blade have also random generated character models. And about one fifth of them would be women, so when you fight a large group of bandits, the chance is one of them is a female. But its not a big deal, the game doesn't care and you do not to. I played TES games for 10 years, and only recently I realized this. I'm not suggesting Stalker games should do it exactly like TES, but something in that direction. 

And then most importantly, we need women saying "Cheeki Breeki".

Anyway I realize some mods do make some steps on adjusting some of these things, and some of them they cannot fix. I noticed the lack of females around the end of the first game, and just recently I watched a video of "Darkest Time" mod, and I heard a female voice actor. It felt so odd and foreign in a stalker game xD

	<TEXT> Nathan Fillon is the "funny" guy, right? 

again unlike OP, I think he does a fantastic delivery of emotion without really needing to change his voice all that much.

But I said when I he is doing work for a real character he usually does his job, the problem is in that the game devs constantly give him these minor roles for no-name character npcs or minor side character, its really jarring since his voice really doesn't fit those characters or its so often in games that it ruins my immersion.

Just think of it like this, I am tired of so many people having the same exact voice. No matter how much you like someone's voice you cannot say that you would prefer that they voice everything and everyone, but instead that they should do specific roles.

However the author threw in Librarians from Metro in Cordon and zombie crowds. It really looks stupid and out of place, especially the Librarian how glitches out often. There are fucking random emissions, grenade spam (incredibly accurate btw), then there are stutters, save game crashes and long loadings. Just too tedious to play. 

- Also the Dead city, completely pointless section, no reason to add it whatsoever but they added it...

Anyway, this mod another case where I am driven mad at how how can somebody that uncreative and narrow minded be so talented, it really feels like a wasted opportunity. </TEXT>

Then the bartender sells me weapons for which doesn't have any ammo, he also doesn't want to buy armors from me, cause reasons. All the suits I am carrying are above 75%, why would he refuse them?

Then to be dicks, they put a meatgrinder so you cannot go to Petrenko, who sells AMMO for the weapons the bartender has....

EDIT:

I think I will stop the game after I saw 2 Apcs after x-18 and stealth camo bandits, there is only so much bloat and stupid I can handle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sure, but I thought he meant refugees from the recent war in Ukraine. There is also a lot of Yugoslavians, most of which are war refugees. 

Civil war in Czechoslovakia? I never heard about that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this question is overdue and pointless in 2017. Of course they fucking are, in 2000 I would have given the same answer, let alone now.

Would you rather enjoy the story of the Last Of Us or an enigmatic Dark Souls game or an cookie cutter Marvel film? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was constantly made fun of because of my heritage. But I never saw it as racism or even as bullying, more like ribbing. It was annoying as hell sometimes, but I didn't feel like a victim at all. When you're fat, you're getting made fun of because you're fat. When you wear glasses, it's that. When you're a slav, it's that and so on and so on. Intent matters. And the intent is not to be racist or whatever, it's just a tool to get you riled up. There is a difference between actual racism and just trying to annoy someone, at least that is how I always felt.

My feelings exactly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently I discussed this with some people and we really couldn't name a big cultural group that is having so much fun with its own stereotypes and negative perception. I do not think I have ever heard a Slav complaining about racism or being offended because of some arbitrary bullshit. Don't get me wrong, Slavs will get offended, but it won't be in a bitchy way we see in the western countries. 

Then you have trilions of terrabytes of videos, songs, images etc... Where Slavs are having fun and making fun of themselves(culture, history, clothes, lifestyle, looks etc...) I think closest I could find to this are Afro-Americans, but there is always the chance of someone going too far and you are not allowed to do it if you are black. I would also argue that they do not go deep and hard enough as Slavs. 

One interesting reason I mention this, is because I never ever hear SJWs/regresives talking about Slavic communities in western countries or how they might feel about anything.  I wonder what would happen if for some reason there was a huge influx of Slavs in western countries(Ukraine for example). Would they treat them as war refuge victims? Or would they be not brown enough for they liking?


EDIT: I just remembered, I meet some Ukrianans who had lots of trouble to get living permissions in Sweden, at the time when the war was in full steam, and they were basically living close to the front line. They were really pissed when they saw how easily "Syrian kids" got the permits.  </TEXT>
