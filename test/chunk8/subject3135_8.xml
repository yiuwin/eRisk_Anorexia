	<TEXT> Thank you for those kind words and the same to you. I have been feeling much more uneasy since the election and every little bit of kindness shown to me has made me feel much better. I appreciate you.

But I don't want to ignore them. I'm tired of people being ignored and feeling left behind, even people who call me names. If I have the time and energy, I am willing to make an effort to see their side and explain mine. We're all in this new world together.

	<TEXT> I'm not insane and I don't appreciate you calling me names. I do believe this is partly about race. I think it's ignorant to try to pin this down on one issue. The world is much more complex than that.

This is how I feel and I'm free to feel that way. Just as you are free to call me insane and say that I'm being lied to and manipulated. I'm sorry you feel sad about that. I hope you stop feeling so sad soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what really scares me in a President Trump world. We just showed the world that this kind of public bigotry and intolerance is not only accepted, but rewarded. What happens when President Trump starts letting the states decide policies that don't protect their citizens? Will it lead to an increase in the bathroom bills? How about more religious freedom acts? Why not more racial profiling laws?

It made me very sad that I had to text my brown-skinned Mexican sister who lives in Texas to ask her to make sure she has her birth certificate and to always make sure she carries her driver license with her when she's in public. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to combine theories and say that while Xo ultimately decides to get an abortion, she miscarries before the procedure. If Xo does get an abortion, I'd be really curious to see how that would be portrayed in the show.

Unless the writer's can make me care more about this childhood friend of Jane's in less than a season than they've made me love Michael, I'd much rather Jane lose her virginity to Michael. So my ~~deepest hope~~ guess is that Michael lives.

I just want Luisa to have a better story-line this season.

I hope Petra doesn't stay #petrafied for too long. She's one of my favorites!

Can Rafael catch a dang break this season? Poor guy deserves some happiness. He might be the most tragic character on this show. </TEXT>

It's something that happens way too often and has no actual affect on anything.", so I don't think they understood what I was asking about.~~ But they did add it to the [General September 30 Releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/55a84s/official_discussion_general_september_30_2016/). I guess we'll just have to discuss it there!
