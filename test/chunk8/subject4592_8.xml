	<TEXT> This is a slightly modified version of the birthday paradox.  
Assuming even distribution of birthdates the odds of any given pair of friends sharing a birthday (not counting leap years) are 1/365
that's a probability space with 365^2 with 365 states identifiable as both of them matching.  
The same can be said about having a matching name.  
Assuming even distribution of names, let N be the number of names you think your friends can have, the odds of any given pair of friends having the same name are 1/N.  
So the odds of any given pair of friends having the same name and birth day are 1/365 x 1/N = 1/365N  

so the odds of any given pair not having the same name AND birthday is 1 - (1/365N)

Now the part of the birthday paradox that makes it seem paradoxical is how many possible pairs of friends you can make with so few people.

Let F be the number of friends in your social circle.  
There are F(F-1)/2 pairs of friends.  
This gets rather big rather quickly.  
For example if you have 20 friends, you have 190 possible pairs.  
  
So the odds that NONE of your friends group have the same name and birthday is:  

(1-(1/365N))^F(F-1)/2   

Meaning the odds of one or more of the pairs matching completely is:
1 - (1-(1/365N))^F(F-1)/2     

So lets plug in some numbers.  
I don't think there are more than 300 commonly used names.  
Let's say you know 50 or so friends.  
1 - (1 -(1/109500))^50x49/2  
1-(109499/109500)^1225  
1 - 0.988875079    
0.011124921 = approximately 1.11% </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think your marketing team is correct.  
There are only 7,000 combinations.  
There are 7 x 10 = 70 birthday message/closings.  
There are 100 names, each could potentially have 70 birthday message/closings.  
So 7 x 10 x 100 = 7,000.

	<TEXT> Influence.  
Essentially, be nice to our companies and people or you won't get candy.  
The companies and people then do stuff they want to do in that country without the foreign government getting in the way and then they hopefully make back more money than was given.  
Often this involves taking resources out of the country for very cheap.  
  
It's also often the case of I'll give you these guns, point them at those guys I don't like or I won't give you more guns.  
This was far more common during the Cold War, but still goes on. 
Often it is also not so much give, as it is sell you these guns for cheap, or let you buy the really fancy guns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because they are very far away.  
Satellites usually top out at around the size of a schoolbus.  
They are also at least 100km away, most are much higher. The international space station is 400km away. Geostationary satellites are   35,786 kilometers away.  
That's just how high the satellites have to orbit.    
  
So lets take the example of a satellite up at roughly the international space station's orbit.  
That is like expecting to be able to make out a school bus in New York, while you are standing in Washington DC.    
You'll only ever be able to make it out if everything else is really dark and it just so happens to reflect the light of the sun back at you.
