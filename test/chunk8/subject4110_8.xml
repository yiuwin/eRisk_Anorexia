	<TEXT> Not to disappoint you but I work heavily with architects out of China and even though every job is originally designed with the intent on being LEED gold/platinum, once the cost comes in sustainability is the first thing out the window. U.S development is far and away designed and executed sustainably.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought that it wouldn't affect me too much and right when it happened I thought I might still be able to follow the team. The past week as time has went on I have felt more and more disconnected to the Chargers. They just don't feel like my team anymore even though the players still remain. Dean Spanos is a scumbag and yeah, I understand the argument that you should be a fan of the team not the owner, I just think I am over the Chargers and in the back of my mind from now on I am going to pray that they fail.  </TEXT>
