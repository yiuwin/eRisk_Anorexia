	<TEXT> Just a little long, lol. But an awesome read. It presented a healthy dose of food for the brain and how I have imagined I would confront death when the time comes. It's something I do tend to think about rather frequently, but mostly in healthy doses these days (there have been really bad times in my life where the thought of death seemed a nice respite of sorts, however). I don't think the thought of what death is and trying to imagine it's existence (or *non*, rather) is something that be an abnormal thing for a person to do, afterall. In the end, I'd imagine the one being most prepared for what may come after life (if anything), the one who perhaps thought about it most whilst they were living.

Thanks again for both your links. Especially the one you wrote, as it was likely rather personal for you to write, I am sure. I liked the wiki link except for the short paragraph, near the end, on TMT and religion. I feel like religion does indeed help many cope with the thought of death and do believe that religion *only* exists because it *is* a coping mechanism, as they provide answers to (imo) the 'unanswerable'. But I am not sure that by agreeing with this thought categorically places oneself into actually believing in life after death. Idk. I digress as this (religion) wasn't really the main topic of interest in your comment.

I hope you continue to find new and positive ways to cope, my friend. Take care.

	<TEXT> Thank you for this link! I often think about how death has driven us as humans, especially in terms of religion, but never really read anything very substantive on the matter. This provides a little more eloquency and substance to these abstract thoughts of mine. </TEXT>

For me, this keyboard seems like it would take way too long to type on. Adding in all those extra space bars sounds like it'd be really inefficient. I could be overthinking this thing though.

	<TEXT> Making it to front page is a double edged sword. Great for the subs exposure, garnering new subscribers, but that same exposure exposes it to opinions to those who don't really know what the fuck they are talking about. 

I've commented before in support of this subs main curator, as he/she is well deserved of it. He/she is one of the better mods that I've encountered in my time here on reddit. Super active, always posting quality posts, with a great amalgamation of creative titles and background info; *on each post*. If you genuinely follow this sub, it should obvious that they put a lot of thought into this sub.

Don't let the shit opinions of a few shitheads get you down. You've got my support. Thanks for doing the job you do!

	<TEXT> First of, thanks for taking the time in such a well thought out response. Everything you said, I can totally respect. You are curious and want to impart that curiosity and/or awareness into others. That is absolutely a good thing. 


I guess where I begin to question (and not necessarily yourself) is when people here are astonished why other people would get perturbed at getting their picture taken. As if, just because they are homeless, they have lost all their rights as a human to be treated with respect and dignity. The chances of someone feeling insecure about some random person taking a photo of them is not bound to class. I know I would be bothered if someone were to be taking pics of me without my consent. 

I guess I questioned intent because admittedly, I do get annoyed with how people here always react to some people as if they are less than human. I feel that consistently uttering the same grumblings about them everytime a post like this comes up doesn't do anything to help anything or anyone. And if grumbling is all people are going to do, whilst there may be others who are minding their own business, doing their best to go unnoticed (I know there are a lot that are dirty fuckers), I am going to scrutinize those who are doing the harping, over these mobile homes. 

I understand these things can be an eyesore. And I understand the freedom to be a photog, especially if there is a purposeful reason (to document for the record). What I often don't understand that comes from this sub, is how and why people always feel so confident in feeling they are a superior human being simply because they have a roof over their head. Simply having a shit opinion about something doesn't really help anything (other than maybe help one's ego). And, I am aware that this, too, is all is just like my opinion, man:)

Thanks again for your cogent reply. I think you are right. It is all ridiculous.

If pictures are being taken for a legitimate purpose to iniate some sort of tangible change, that's one thing. If they are being taking just to be posted up here for the same people who harp on this kinda shit everytime it is posted to r/portland; well then, I can't say, I see the purpose in that.

	<TEXT> Thank you! This is shit journalism. 

Not sure what the exact context of the quote was taken from, but after watching today's press briefing, I would venture the context being somewhere along the lines of Russia being an ally in defeating ISIS. Especially considering   that Spicer reiterated numerous times throughout the briefing that our focus is still on ISIS even after we bombed  Assad's Syria. Which is just double speak, for "We have no idea what the fuck we are doing right now."

Either way these "blue" news outlets that have recently been popping up here are just shitposts from the left. 

E: I'd hate for this sub to turn into an unabashed version of t_d for the left. We need to recognize good journalism when we see it and give credit where credit is due.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They did kind of address this in the piece.


 An example of that hands-off approach was the beer aisle, which always reflected a selection appropriate the neighborhood. The blend of mass market, local craft, national craft, and imports varied substantially store to store, and at certain outlets the selection was as good as many specialty bottle shops. In Oregon, somewhere between a quarter and a third of the beer sold is in the craft segment, and that number is substantially higher in Portland. In certain neighborhoods in Portland, it would shock me to learn that craft is not the majority seller. When you talk dollar share of sales, these figures become even more stark.


That's the way it has been. But considering some of the overall trends in beer sales, there is some reason for this to possibly change in the near future. 

That's what got out of the article, anyways. </TEXT>

So true. And not only this, but even if he were to be ousted out of office, the regime as it stands is already so well entrenched that could easily maintain a similar status quo for what he has already started. Between the henchmen he has installed and his rollbacks we'd still have a lot of shitty water we'd have to wade through, if he were gone.

	<TEXT> So, you'd rather attribute the potential increase in requests, to reddit's growth vs. any changes we see on the federal levels, here in the U.S.?

Just curious, cuz I would venture that many users would like to believe the increase inevitable due to new changes to some of the feds and their guidelines, but not sure how grounded in reality that would be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel ya. My folks are pretty reasonable for being red and devout catholic. We have gone through some pretty gnarly squabbles about politics and religion in the past, but that kind of stuff doesn't happen too much these days. 

I sincerely believe that if Jesus were to have really been the kind of man the bible has pegged him out to be, then he would probably be pretty distraught if he were to pay us a visit and see some of the shit that we got going on right now. This is a common ground that I have found works pretty good for me and my folks. My folks are pretty charitable and empathetic people, they are anti war and capital punishment *because* they are pro-life (I think it's cool, that at least they are consistent across the board about being *for* life). They seem to be slowly changing the degree in their acceptance of others with different lifestyles. Like I said, they are pretty reasonable for being super religious, like I would consider them to be the "good kind" of catholic, but since they are pro-life and they feel that that notion is the end all be all of everything, they are fucking red:( Sucks, cuz I'm pretty sure they voted for Trump fully knowing the joke of a person that he was. Horrible. 

Sorry for the ramble </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally. My folks went from being democrat to declaring republican whilst I was in college (early 00's) solely because of their pro-life stance.

The thing here is; many of the same people who are "pro-life" are also pro capital punishment and pro war mongerers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although croissant and puff pastry are both laminated doughs, they  are not quite the same. Croissant dough uses two leaveners: butter and yeast. While puff pastry just uses butter. Which would, in turn, yield a denser product. So you were kind of on the right track there, with the absorbency thought:) </TEXT>
