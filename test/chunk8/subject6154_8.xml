	<TEXT>  this is the shit they where talking about dude.

Oh, I don't deny that. It is a product of living a public life on one of the most toxic websites for 11 years straight. And yes, the website has "exploded", which is why - if we continued Microwave as everyone likes to suggest, that would have been left behind in the dust too.

EDIT: So, are emojis bad, or good? /AskingForAFriend </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I said in the 3 years following. The show has been gone for six now. Viewership slide happened in late 2013 after the switch to OneChannel, and the WatchTime algorithms. And, TMS never reached "millions". Only a few videos have, and it took 'em 8+ years to get there.

But yeh, current viewership is awful. Wish I knew how to fix it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair... 

11 years on YouTube have made me a bitter and defensive old crone. I hope you'll forgive my posture, but I really am a pleasant chap when I'm not being constantly criticized and insulted by strangers on the internet :-)

Hang out at a live show, or watch some of my adventure vlogs - I'm a cool guy, honest. Thanks for the feedback though - it really is something I've tried to curb in recent years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeh, Jory and I launched the 'side channels' seven years ago this month, April 2010. A decision I now regret as it fractured my/our audience - but at the time, it seems prudent so as not to overload /Jogwheel, which already had 3 or 4 shows going on at the time.

Fun fact, my 2nd channel, /Jon is actually the oldest active channel on all of YouTube! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  *that's a huge recipe for disaster.*

Viewership / subs / revenue / sponsorships all went *way* up in the 3 years following TMS's retirement, actually!

But to be clear, nothing was "replaced". Jogwheel is a variety channel. There were a hundred videos posted before Microwave even existed, and hundreds more since. Every show ran concurrently with several others, they still do. 

Nice to meet an old fan though, sincerely. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YouTube critic here... and this is what my [writing checklist](https://i.gyazo.com/21a54c83e140be00bed03f72ae73da29.png) looks like.

I don't necessarily comment on every one of these items in every review, but it's a really good collection of elements worth mentioning. Usually, I write from a place of emotion (how do I feel about the film?) - and when I get a few paragraphs in, I check to see how many of these bullet-points I've touched-upon. Helps prevent me from forgetting and major stuff :) </TEXT>

So, these movies seemed to have been available on all types of mattes and framing over the years. BUT... the BluRay releases are, supposedly, 100% 'correct', and the optimal framing as intended by Zemeckis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All great points, and basically my thoughts as well. I've been on YouTube for 11 years now *(the channel they're purchasing from is actually the oldest active channel on the entire site)* - so I'd like to think I know a bit about longevity / possible futures. Four of the 5 videos this company wants to buy are from 2010-2011 - all still pulling in $50-100 a month. But they haven't always been that strong, and I don't know how long they'll stay that way. You seem confident YouTube will still be around in 20 years; but it's doubtful it'll still be the revenue powerhouse it is today. Hell, revenues have already declined 70% in the past three years - in another three?

As for "who wants it most", well - it isn't me. But it's an interesting offer I thought I'd forward to this SubReddit to spark a discussion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's no amount of "resources" that can make a 6-year-old video suddenly profitable again, aside from updating metadata -- which I'm reluctant do change (again), since they're all performing so well. 

And yes, they hope to make money in the long-term, in years 3+. Whereas for me, that's uncertain, and money now is a guaranteed solution to many bills :-)

As for negotiating - obviously. I seemed to have hit their ceiling (if their "this is the most aggressive deal we've ever offered in the past year" is to believed. Got them to come up about 15% at least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, as I mentioned in the original post; the value they're offering equates to about 2-years worth of revenue for those 5 videos.

As for "short term" v "long term". This is my 11th year on YouTube... so, I'd like to think I know a thing or two about longevity.

Essentially, if I take the deal, I'm betting against myself; and predicting my content will dry up. If I reject the deal, I'm betting these videos will remain (surprisingly) profitable long into the future. And honestly, given YouTube's history, and my channel's trajectory, the former seems more likely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've received an interesting offer from a (legitimate) company that buys YouTube videos; specifically, five of my highest performing uploads. Their lump-sum offer is enticing... but I estimate the content we're negotiating over would eventually earn that same amount in two years.

"Two years vs. forever" is sort of a no brainier to hold the videos for myself, and be patient with money. But at what point does the up-front offer more value? Five years is a lifetime on YouTube, so even though I'm confident this content will still be around earning *some* cash by then, it's doubtful I'll still be relying on their monthly-income as I am now. Especially when $X today is likely more valuable to me than $X in 2020?

This is mostly a hypothetical, "*what would you do?*"-scenario for discussion. Curious to see how other YouTubers have, or would deal with this situation. Thanks.

By rejecting my statements, and suggesting that *"youtube employees [don't] care about anything"* you are, in effect, making a claim. And one that has been refuted now several times. Classifying your comment as "opinion" doesn't make it any less wrong. Sorry.

Moreover, what "personal observation" are you even referring to?

 Community Guidelines strikes are issued when *our reviewers* are notified of a violation of the Community Guidelines

You're the one making claims that are contrary to all the available evidence - so the burden of proof is on you. If you believe this practice counts as "deceptive", go flag some videos, and report back with how many actually get restricted for breaking the community guidelines.  </TEXT>

A large majority of the website is automated, but when something is manually flagged by a group of users for breaching community guidelines - there are humans who review it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, you may think it's a "dirty move", but I still disagree. And moreover, that's an entirely different argument than suggesting it's "deceptive" in the eyes of the community guidelines - which ARE overseen by YouTube employees.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, sorry - there isn't a single YouTube employee who would ever uphold that kind of flag. 

Suggesting the video is entirely something else is deceptive, but simply omitting (only within the title) that it's not part of a series? - that's not deceptive, it's just marketing.  </TEXT>

Per /u/DoubleUpTony's [thread / request](https://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/5wxpm7/updated_thumbnail_safe_area_overlay/), here's an updated version of my old thumbnail overlay guide. Hope it helps you some!

Just download the PNG from the direct-link above, and *try* to design the most important elements of your thumbnail design (text/faces) in the "safe" area. And speaking of text, big, bold white fonts with drop-shadows work best! Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  but any advice for a fledgling reviewer?

Haha, you and me both. 

I feel like, getting started, you'll make more progress addressing a niche, instead of chasing after the same big Marvel releases as anyone else. /u/bondjaybond for example focuses (mostly) on horror reviews, and is often the first-to-market (or only) to examine some lower-budget, film festival stuff in that genre. 

I like to focus on classics, and Oscar nominees - with big tentpole episodes focused around entire franchises.

As for finding your voice? Avoid using the words "I" or "me" in your reviews too much, as it weakens your argument and sounds less professional. Ex: don't say "I felt the acting was good", just say, "The acting was good". 

And as for YouTube-advice? Thoroughly read their Creator Playbook, and follow all of its advice! Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *ALWAYS*. The process is risk-free, takes less than 30 seconds, and waiting will only forfeit your opportunity to save your revenue in escrow.

And this is ESPECIALLY true in your case since it's a clear example of fair use. *Dispute* immediately. And if you lose, *appeal* it. And if you lose that, *counter-notify*. Don't be afraid to defend your content.

But take it from someone who has the most-watched film-review show on YouTube, and has successfully defended over 1,000+ copyright claims -- avoid huge uninterrupted chunks of trailer footage if you want to avoid automatic claims. Split them up into smaller chunks, and cut back to a shot of yourself, and you'll be less likely matched by Content ID. Moreover, your 'fair use' defense will be stronger, too. Good luck :-) </TEXT>
