	<TEXT> I think Amy Schumer is fucking hilarious. I think she says and does things, that if a man said and did, people would not bat an eye. Sure she relies on shock-value and vulgarity but there are plenty of males in Hollywood who do the same thing and nobody cares. I feel like the whole joke stealing thing was overblown and many comedians come up with similar jokes organically.

Alright, so I've pulled the gender card (justly so I feel) and talked about liking someone Reddit hates, let the down-votes rain down on me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to go a different rout the most in here OP.

You should see my husband's desktop. Icons everywhere of random shit he has saved. The man in an organizational disaster. 

Anyway, a year or so back for Father's Day I made him a scrap book of pictures of him and his daughter (my stepdaughter) and it was a surprise, so I couldn't ask him for the pictures. 

I got the picture by going through the three older computers in the garage. It was a lot of work and I found several random pics of several exs on the old computers. Not a lot mind you, just random ones here and there. The newest computer to be stored away was the one he had for the first year we were dating and that one had a few too. Do I think he was still hung up on them and being malicious or holding on to the past and missing them? Heck no. The guy couldn't be bothered to tidy up his desktop, let alone his random downloads picture folder. I could have seen him easily sending me the wrong file by mistake, though its never happened. 

My husband is 10 years older than me so don't let people tell you the age gap is creepy. That's nonsense. 

Am I saying the other people in this thread are wrong? No. I don't know your SO, only you do. All I know is I know my SO and I could totally see this happening with him. It's up to you whether you feel this needs to be a "thing" or not. If you think it does, by all means, but don't let people force you to over-react (if it is an over reaction) either. 

Heck, I think my husband still has boudoir photos of his ex wife in an old duffle bag in the attic with all his other photos of his friends and family from his 20's before I met him. It was a part of his past. I am a part his present/future. Who cares?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Existential dread.

I can seriously be doing everything right and it still creeps up on me. House is clean, kid is doing well in school and is fed/clean/happy, house is clean, excelling in all three of my jobs, doing well in school getting my master's degree, husband and I are doing well, animals are happy, diet and exercise are on point, doesn't matter "WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?!"

You'd be surprised the things anxiety makes you accomplish. 

It also happens when I am failing at all of those things, but at least then, I feel like the feelings are warranted.

Point is, the dread happens whether everything is right or wrong so I realized it has no baring on whatsoever, whether I'm doing well or not, so even though it's there I feel justified in ignoring it and just doing my best.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mental health.

My mom is a nurse but she is nearly 60 and was raised VERY old school (like, my grandma reminds me of the mother from Carrie). She has done a lot to combat this but I think that at a certain level she may never fully grasp it. 

My brother and I both have pretty high anxiety and depression and when one of us is having a "bout" of either, she always seems so lost about why or, "what she could have done to mess us up so bad" when really it's 99% some sort of chemical imbalance. 

It's like mentally she *knows* about mental
Illness but deep down she feels responsible or wants to fix whatever is making us sad and that's just unfortunately not how it works. As a mother myself I can't imagine how frustrating that must be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have two girls (10 and 7) and I just started a new job about three months ago after being very underemployed the previous few months. Im scraping by right now just trying to pay back-bills and I'm pretty sure I won't be able to spend more than 50-75$  each on them. It's a lot more than some kids have and I know they will be happy with what I give them but I can't help but feel a wave of ick every time I think about it, especially when I was easily able to do double last year. 

In the end they won't be unhappy about it. They are grateful/good kids. I am going to feel bad and I need to just keep doing my best and get over it.  </TEXT>

You could be dating a sports car vs. a Ford Taurus, but if the Taurus has a full tank of gas and the sports car has an empty one, which will get you further? Potential is shit if they are not living up to it and it's unfair to date a sports car with no gas and then demand it take you somewhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yuuuup. I got schooled over and over again during my pregnancy about how "breast is best". When I left the hospital they sent me home with a pack of formula "just In Case" even though I insisted I didn't need it. 

Did I mention I have an autoimmune disease and my body nearly REFUSED to make more than an ounce of milk every six hours?! I had a crying baby with no milk coming (and to top it all off a husband who told me he would not wake up in the middle of the night to feed "a fucking Baby" (that he convinced me to keep in the first place)) and still was determined to breastfeed because of the guilt I felt?!

One night, about a week in, my baby was crying and I had not slept at all, and I broke down and made a bottle of the formula and gave it to her and proceeded to cry on the kitchen floor where my husband stepped over me to get a glass of water in the middle of the night. After that full bottle of formula she slept through the night from then on and I divorced her dad. Apparently I was still responsible for everything baby even though he was unemployed and I had a full time job and was going to school full time...

Anyway, point of the story, if you need formula, USE IT!!! And don't let the bitch in line at the supermarket behind you, shame you for for buying formula make you cry like I did.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, so my boyfriend and I just watched white Christmas and it is by far our favorite episode. One thing, he says that I am crazy to empathize with the cookies because they're "Just computers after all". I tried to explain to him that since they are exact copies of the people's brains they believe that they're real people and experience real emotion. He argued that computers are incapable of experiencing real emotion. He still said I was silly and crazy for feeling bad for them. Am I nuts or is he the crazy one?

When the guy first put that girl cookie in the blank room for two weeks I was shocked. Then when he didn't for six months, I gasped. Am I being silly?

We broke up close to six years ago. I'm remarried now to a wonderful loving man that loves my daughter as if she were his. All around good dude who is also a survivor of a cheating spouse so we really get one another.

	<TEXT> I was at a college party once in 2006 (so the 9/11 "fuck all muslims" vitriol was more publicly accepted than it is now) and we had a 'soldier' bragging about how he liked to kill women and children when he was in Iraq and started off into this loud brag-y story about how he killed a kid on purpose and laughed and I told him he should be ashamed of himself and got booed out of the party for "shaming a hero". Ahh the joy of going to an agricultural college...

My husband who has served 20 years in the Army and gone to Iraq twice says he doubts that guy was ever deployed or ever killed a kid, because if he had, he wouldn't be bragging about it. I have no idea. 

For the record, I realize sometimes soldiers *have* to kill children, but this guy was talking about stalking some kid who was minding his own business so than he could kill him. Kept talking about how muslims were vermin who needed to be exterminated down to the last child.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm bi and a woman. 

I dated a girl for about two weeks and soon found out she was bonkers. Not one of those "ha ha all women are crazy" things, she was legit committed-to-the-nut-hut-twice-a-year-at-least bonkers. She had really good moments where I really liked her and others where she was an entirely different person. Have to mention she was also insanely hot. Pretty out of my league if looks were the only factor. 

Anyway, we break up. I move on and she doesn't. I try to stay friends but eventually have to go no contact because she is obsessed with me. Time goes on. Years pass. I get married to a man. She still calls me about once a month when she's drunk and leaves long confusing messages.

One day she runs into one of my friends and tells her she is also my friend and gets herself invited to a get-together we were having and I have to tell her to go home at the door when she shows up with my friend. My friend is very apologetic and had no idea it was my ex that I had complained about.

Weeks go by and one day I come home early from work (I worked graveyard as a waitress, this was years ago) and I find her fucking my husband. She's totally drunk and we lived in a bad area so I decided to drive her home so her murder and/or rape wouldn't be on my conscience. So yeah, that car ride was awkward. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My husband (now ex husband) did shit like this. He knew I wanted to feel special on my birthday so to combat it he would be extra demeaning and hateful and would refuse to say "happy birthday" because he knew that was all I wanted from him. Many husbands worry about forgetting their wife's birthday. Mine would remember mine just to make sure I didn't have a good time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm getting my master's degree in Special Education. What you said is correct, though there are more steps involved with getting an autism diagnosis when you or your child is of school-age. I don't know about adults but we have diagnosticians who need a masters degree just to diagnose kids with disabilities. More goes into an autism diagnosis than a casual conversation (when it comes to school age kids. I can't speak for or against what you have said about adult diagnosis.)

Although I'm sure it has happened, but the VAST majority of parents fight a special education diagnosis. We have to take entire classes on how to break the diagnosis to parents and how to convince them their kids need special education services. An autism diagnosis could really hurt someone's future prospects so most smart parents would not seek one out for their average kid. It's not a benefit to have it.

I want to add that I'm not getting my master's as a diagnostician but we take a lot of the same classes. My emphasis is in learning disabilities, not autism, so you can take what I say with a small grain of salt, but we definitely operate in the same realm and at the end of my program (three classes away) I'll be certified to work with all sped children, including those with autism, so I do have to know something about it even though my main focus is things like ADHD and dyslexia.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a high stress job and was anxious all the time. I finally quit and took a break to do something less stressful but I found I would just stress MORE about the few things I could stress about so my stress level still felt the same. Then I lost that job and was unemployed for a few months (I knew everything was going to be alright eventually as my boyfriend could support us while I got a new career) and I had nothing to stress about and I was STILL just as stressed and anxious and worried. 

Then one day I had the perfect day. Saw a good movie, house was clean, good food, good company, boyfriend and I were cuddling and I remember feeling so happy and yet STILL I was worried even though I couldn't think of anything I was worried *about* just that I had that sickening worry deep down with nothing to attach it to. It's like I felt incredibly guilty even though In had done nothing wrong. 

No matter how much I freed up my life from stress, the anxiety would just grow to fill that space. That's when I knew I had a really big problem.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom is coming to pick me and my daughter up to go dress shopping for my brothers wedding in Seattle at the end of the month.

I'm super excited for my brother and I love his fianc and I am so grateful to my mom for paying for our dresses and our flight out there. 

Still I have to pick up around the house before she gets here because she is very judgmental. I've also been dreading going dress shopping because she always has comments about my body and I'm a recovered bulimic so the comments really get to me.   

I'm battling a severe bout of depression right now. The worst I've ever experienced. I don't want to go dress shopping, I don't want to see my mom, and I don't want to go to my brothers wedding and meet new people and see old friends/family. I'd rather die. No I'm not suicidal, I'd just rather die than go. But it's not about me so I'm going. I'd never forgive myself if I didn't. 

Why won't people just leave me alone. I don't want friends and I don't want family I just want my husband and my daughter and for everyone to leave me alone. God I sound like such a spoiled child.  </TEXT>

I struggled with bulimia for a long time and because of it, I did a lot of research in eating disorders. One day, a guy mentioned a side effect he was experiencing after crash-dieting and I mentioned that, while most likely nothing, the side effect he was mentioning could be a side effect of a genetic proclivity towards anorexia, and to just be aware. 

The poster thanked me as well as several other people who suffered from anorexia, for pointing this out, but one of the mods argued with me for hours about how there were no genetic factors involved in developing eating disorders and it went on and in until we were arguing about if it was or was not a trait passed on and developed by hunter gatherers to survive times of starvation.

The mod kept asking for evidence to my claims and I continually provided scholarly sources and he/she would shoot them down because they "were right and I should except thy were right because they were a mod on fitness". The whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth and I started going on that sub less and less and before that, I had felt like I was a valued member of the community.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will never cheat on an SO.... again.

My ex husband cheated on me seven times (that I know of). I've always been very anti-cheating, but after the sixth time, in some insane plot to hurt him back, I went out and cheated on him and then went directly home and told him about it so he would know how it felt and so I could hurt him the way he hurt me. I felt horrible and I compromised something I used to love about myself. I regret it immensely because I could always claim the high road before that. He ended up cheating a seventh time and that was one of the reasons I finally ended it.

That being said, I will never cheat again, no matter the circumstance. I will also not tolerate an SO cheating on me. Once is a deal breaker. I'm tired of holding myself to a higher standard than my partner.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just finished reading "Ready Player One" and am also in the process of re-reading "The Dark Tower" series. I'm looking for something adventurous but not incredibly deep.

I love literary fiction but I've recently not been in the mood for it. I want fluffier fiction that really is about the adventure rather than some sort of deeper commentary about the human condition. 

Ideally it would be deeper than "Ready Player One" (which was great but feels like YA fiction) but no deeper than "The Dark Tower" (which almost flirts with literary fiction).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have Hashimotos hypothyroid, PCOS, Depression, anxiety (both common side effects of Hashimotos) and bulimia nervous. 

The Hashimotos and bulimia are under control and don't bother me much (anymore) but there is always a chance of a resurgence of the bulimia but I feel really solid right now. With the Hashimotos, I just have to keep taking my pills.

The depression and anxiety are a bit of a struggle but I'm not suicidal or anything it's just so exhausting. There is really nothing to be done for the PCOS unless it gets a lot worse.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can pretty much walk anywhere in El Paso or las cruces at any time of day or night and be relatively safe. It's VERY safe. It's not "leave your doors unlocked in the country" safe, but the mere idea that someone would ask this question about El Paso/las cruces tickled me pink. 

It's super safe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do bottom-of-the-barrel ghost freelance writing for reference. 


1) It is horrifying what some companies will have you write about with no prior experience. I accepted and wrote a self help book because I felt like I had a lot of advice to give and a lot of life experience to draw from but they just as easily could have hired a 16 year old trust fund baby to do it. I've turned down multiple jobs to write about things I have no business writing about. I told clients that and *still* had them try and press me to write it.  I mostly do romance novels (I would much rather be writing something else, trust me) because there is a huge demand for it and it doesn't require research. I can't mess anyone's life up with fiction the way I could if I tried to write a book on how to disarm a bomb.

2) 2,000 words is done in one day easily. The max I ever did was 8,000 in a day for a client that was desperate. 

3) pricing heavily depends on your skill level, the company you work with, your past experience, the demand, luck....tons of other factors. If you are just starting out like me and have no name for yourself, you are competing with tons of people who are trying to make a career out of writing and they are all undercutting each other. The worst I ever got paid was half a penny per word and the best was slightly over a penny per word (0.013). Lots of other people make more. The price range is insane. Some people can make like fifty cents a word. It all depends.  </TEXT>

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT STRICTER GUN LAWS I SUPPORT!!!!!

There are plenty of reasons for the stricter gun laws I support.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you know I don't have revolvers? You *are* making assumptions I have magazines in my pistols. You also made the assumption I want stricter gun laws based off of a crime argument which isn't true. You are also assuming that either one, I can't call myself a liberal without agreeing with every single democratic stance on every issue (not true, I can still be a liberal and not agree with every single thing Hilary has said/done) and two, the stricter gun laws I want to see, align with the current path of *certain* members of the Democratic Party.

To claim you are not making assumptions is ludicrous. You don't even know if you disagree with me because I made no indication of *what* stricter gun laws I want to see enforced.

Maybe I want a STRICT gun law that every man woman and child should be given AK-47 at birth. (That's not the case but you don't know!) this thread is not the place to argue gun control.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tell me, what guns do I already own? I only named half of one distinctly. What other guns do you know I have? 

Next, who ever said I thought stricter gun laws would stop criminals? That's not my motivation for stricter gun laws. 

Thirdly, which democrats? "The" democrats? *all* democrats? Which democrats are you assuming I support? 

You are making an awful lot of assumptions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. He's been in the military (Army, infantry) for nearly 20 years and is now studying to be a cop when he retires from the military. When we started dating, for one of our first dates he took me out and taught me to shoot. When we moved in together he showed me all the different weapons (bat, 2 pistols, shotgun, AR, machete, hatchet, knives) strategically hidden throughout the house and we have several plans for different scenarios that we practice in the event of an emergency. 

Did I mention I'm a pacifist liberal? This definitely was not natural for me but I'm not anti-gun. (FYI we are both for much stricter gun laws In the USA) 

There is no doubt in my mind that my husband would save me or die trying, and even better, he has trained me to be able to save myself. He would be 100% cool, calm, collected and exacting should an emergency arise. This goes for home invasion, medical, any emergency situation really. I've never felt more safe in my life.  </TEXT>
