	<TEXT> If Europeans value welfare spending so much they would rather get taken over by Russia and ISIS, then let it be. They decide their own priorities.

Realistically, though, it's not a stretch to see Europe taking up the responsibility of defense. The benefit of spreading military spending more evenly is that no one country is burdened with being the world police. The coalition may be a world police, but no one country is. So the spending burden isn't as huge as you suggest. Also, a lot of European countries are already used to spending taxpayer money for foreigners. The Germans burned billions of Euros by giving the Greeks bailout funds that were never paid back.

I understand why people are worried about the European nationalist movements, but everyone is forgetting that

A) The current US head of state is more nationalist than 90% of European leaders. So why are we all rushing to defend US leadership?

B) Outside Britain, Poland, and Hungary, nationalism in Europe hasn't progressed that far. Le Pen probably isn't going to become president, and nationalist parties have been sort of retreating since Trump's election. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but moderate Republicans and corporate Democrats oppose safety nets and support globalization, which is arguably worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  With regards to globalization and the ability to address constituents needs - I think it can be said that governments have had a hard time addressing the pitfalls of free trade and globalization.

This is an important point. The issue is that the people who support globalization are very often the same people who are most skeptical of labor laws and social safety nets. This is worse in the US than in Europe. Once your factory job goes away, there's very little support infrastructure to help you maintain your lifestyle and reintegrate into the economy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> European countries cut welfare spending en masse with the post-recession austerity programs. So yes, they're willing to do it. Austerity was controversial because it increased unemployment -- but guess what you can do with the unemployed when you have a bigger military budget?

The question wasn't about NATO dissolving, and I'm not going to take that as a given. The US gives NATO about a fifth of its budget. The other 27 members can make up for the difference.

Europe was very militarized during the Cold War. I believe Britain spent ~5% of its GDP on military in the 1980s, which is proportionally higher than current US military spending. And yet, no WWIII. Nuclear weapons and economic integration made sure of that.

Under this hypothetical, the European Union does not collapse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They could expand their militaries to make up for the difference. The listed countries have a combined population much greater than the US. A lot of them already have considerable experience in coalition missions.

So many NATO countries are failing to meet the requirements *because* the US has taken such a strong role in world affairs. They would indeed step up to replace the US, because their survival depends on it. There's broad agreement that there needs to be a counterbalance to Russia, and that's not going to change just because the US pulls out. But the US pulling out would end the current laziness in military spending.

Too much division is dangerous, but some is necessary. It would have been a tragedy if every Western country decided to follow the US into Iraq. That said, on the most important issues, such as North Korea and Russia, non-US Western leadership is fairly united. </TEXT>
