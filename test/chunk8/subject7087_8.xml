	<TEXT>  There was no switch. Democrats stayed in the Democratic party. Republicans stayed in the Republican party. 

That is factually incorrect, ALL southern whites went from the Democratic to GOP

The only admitted KKK member in the US Senate in the 21st century was Robert Byrd; a Democrat.

Sen Byrd left the KKK in 1952 and called it "the greatest mistake of his life" 

When he died in 2010 the NAACP mourned his death and said"consistly supported a civil rights agenda"

He switched to liberal like the democrats, funny how exKKK members that still hold the KKK values like Duke support Trump not the democrats.

Ha.

Nader had thousands at rallies in 2000 and only got 5% of the vote.. 

Also there is no doubt that people who are voting for Trump are kinda like a cult and LOVE him, most of Clinton voters dont exactly love her but will vote for her over Trump because he is a fascist so that clearly makes a difference with rallies etc  </TEXT>
