it's only so long users can  bite tongue while users are posting lies and unsubstantiated crap week after week.

There should be no personal attacks.
But if another user being stupid you have every right to tell them that.

The main culprits been banned again anyway so now we have only 1 or 2 trouble makers left

Well not 28inch.
as only an idiot buys a 28 inch 4k screen as it's pointless just stick to 1440p at that size.

Benq has one too for Visual designers.

Also so does   AOC  in it's pro series but it's not out till june.

they all use the same panel "LG"  pretty much so  it's just rebadges.


Apparantly that LG screen has almost perfect colour uniformity  as well </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly.

Change and  online protests make the user feel like they have Voiced  the concerns they have.
Meanwhile it does jack shit.

I mean it would be much more effective if ur potest is a poltical one 
 instead next time ur at the shops or down town take 5 minutes go to the MP of ur electorates office and tell them that.
It does get progress.

Same for a company.
They do something sus.
Put a note on the facebook page.
or a note in the local paper. so ppl actually know that.
Ive had much better experience getting conflict resolution by bad mouthing a company online. I once had a faulty  laptop  and MSI just sent me a new one  after i complained on facebook.


im starting to think though that change can't really be enacted as deep down a large percentage of people are apathetic  or are too stupid to realise when an issue is impacting them.

I mean i want to steer clear of politics.
But god damn.
MUH GOD MY WAGES ARE SHIT.
Come election time who do u vote for a liberal member who's going to cut ur wages anyway? 

I mean it's gotten to the point where  members of parliment could immolate a new born baby on national tv.
PPL would be outraged.
But then the storms would win some massive upset victory on the weekend and everyone's attentions been refocused.

We got and NZ and others got it early.
as it's called market teasing.
And the fact the sound editing was done in melb helped too.

We have almost always gotten marvel films a week early.
it's easy to track a smaller market to see how well ur going to do.
plus it builds hype.

99.99 percent of games at the store are just a STEAM/ORIGIN code anyway.
all it has is the steam installer on a disc and the direct x drivers.(REALLY,REALLY WE NEED A DISC FOR dxlol.)


Steam frankly can get fucked.
there was a pretty good article on EUROgamer about it as well.
They may be charging us 79USD.
but they sure as fuck aint paying the devs that money it's more like they get 15 percent of the sale.

	<TEXT> yeah but rudd went on the bolt report.
why cause when ur pm ur trying to be PM for everyone not just ur side.
Shying away from the ABC  is how we have gotten to the point where they won't come on Q and A anymore  if they are going to get asked a question about the NBN  as they know they will get ripped apart for it.

	<TEXT> It's also a protecionism scheme.

China as much as the west knows the NK regime is no sustainble.
But if it does go down.
you now have 24 million ppl  looking for work and food.
They will cross into china and SK.
China can't have this it would be a humanitarian crisis on an unseen level.
that's why  it's easier to prop up a shitty regime than let it fall </TEXT>

Kims dad even openly said that in a communique to the UN.
All we want is to be reconginzed and our govt  to be reconised as a legitimate leader.
Un shoots back well get rid of the nuke's and we will..

They can't as thats the only thing giving them legiticamcy.

	<TEXT> Okay  Op.

this is easiest way.

Does the VPN use  a VM server through AWS.
Yes, then netflix blocks it.
thats what they pretty much did.
any block Ips from them are checked for multi user acounts. and  if so it's nuked.


So  
PIA.
TORGUARD.
TygerVpn.
Tunnelbear.
Most of the main ones are blocked.

If your just after TV series.
just get AMAZON prime has a pretty big tv catalouge and they don't geoblock VPNs </TEXT>

The other day i had to pretty much provide the proof that a user was talking out the waste disposal when they claimed the CFMEU used 457 workers. they do not.
Claiming they do is not proof.

Give them a warning where is ur evidence.
None provided.
thats a paddling.

	<TEXT> Yes.
Submit articles.
But not from  Non-newsy hacks. who's last job was as a project  manager for PWC(the specator)

Submiting a Tax policy article from a right winh think tank.
 of course it's going to back up the rights narrative,same goes for the spectator or any other article that instead of  debating an issue starts  to ramp up the left v right rehotoric that's not what we need.

As much as ppl hate the ABC  or the guardian or the canberra times on the right.
They hate it cause it pokes holes in the narratives they have been forced to ingest. im a  Lib voter and happy to admit that.
but the shit you see in some of the papers in aus are so vitriolic to one side it might as well not be called news anymore </TEXT>

But we need to draw the line in the sub.
an opinion is not a fact.

Claiming that  fossil fuel has gotten no subsidys is opionion when right below it another user proved him wrong with actual Govt budget  forms proving otherwise.
But then goes.
That's not a subsidy.
 ah yeah it is when it says TAX SUBSIDY on the bloody PDF header from the APH website </TEXT>

He was making claim that  the CFMEU has hired  457 workers when the only unions that have are united and the SDA.
so a factually  incorrect statement to make.

There are many more.
People are acting like they downvote him cause of who he is.

They don't.
He get's downvoted as   he sometimes  shoots himself in the foot by  stating his opinion as though it's fact </TEXT>

it's an opinion piece lambasting  a certain subset of  society.
As i said the paper that he listed is not journalistic  otherwise it would not have had it's  application to the union of newspapers and journalism knocked back  to let it's employees join the internaion jounalism guild the only other Australian paper that was denied was the daily tele.

anyway debates over i think subs on it's way out when the mods wont even enforce the own rules they set when we can have biased opionion pieces posted as news
the posted aritcle is trying to run up the flagpole a left vs right argument instead of trying to stay neurtral to the subs intent

We only have freedom of political expression in regards to elections and even then it's not really a law it's just an unheld court precedence.
iii. Do not spam your political bias, or post biased agenda driven material

Pretty sure an Opinion piece trying to make the greens look bas is agenda driven.
