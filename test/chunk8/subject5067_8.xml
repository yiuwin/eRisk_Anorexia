	<TEXT> I seriously lack empathy, its kinda hard to explain.. It's like, I KNOW what someone maybe feels like if the same has happened to me, but i cant really be happy for someone or be sad for someone, whenever people open up to me and talk I just kinda sit awkwardly and wait for them to stop as i have no fucking clue whatsoever what I'm meant to do there. I do feel everything else though, so I'm not a psycho/sociopath 

I guess its easy in a way but for me its super strange as i only lack empathy and still have a conscience sorry for late reply though, was looking for some answers from others and this popped up haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know the steps, but how do I move forward from knowing that it's the best one that I've always known, way before athene was even known, that I've grown to accept, that thinking logically and doing the stuff that's most logical is the best way to go about? 

I'm the type of person that doesn't really feel emotions that strongly and thus even though every time I do stuff logically and it obviously works and I connect it to new positive feelings I still don't  know how to override comfort. That's like sitting versus standing, you know sitting is fucking stupid and standing desk is one of the best things you can spend your money on if you ever use tables or desks but you just can't bother

Edit: Maybe my first problem is that I'm not really sure how I'm meant to connect even stronger positive feelings to logic :/ ?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my problem is that I completely understand that logic is the most, well, logical core value and I've always thought so, but it simply doesn't show in my actions and that's my biggest problem. My core value at the moment is comfort, I do things to feel comfortable. So how do I change my core value? I do understand these things that athene talked in his video, I completely understand that logic provides more safety and is the logical choice, but I feel like even if I start doing things that are logical it wont connect to my reward center and I'll have to live a boring life since it surely isn't logical to play or just ''chill''. 
My problem isn't that I couldn't do the ''boring'' stuff, obviously I can, but I wouldn't feel rewarded, I'd only do it to get comfort at the end. 

tl;dr: How do I change my core value if I already understand that logic is better but am too ''lazy'' or whatever.

Thanks for any replies  </TEXT>

You were able to get super fast 5 stacks if someone ran towards a bush where you were hiding, but instead you get 2 now. I go warlords because I enjoy it more and that way if someone get thornmail I'm not as fucked (even though red potion usually counters that). Tld is okay but if you're going that you might aswell get the 45% cdr and try that, fervor is still, by far, the best option lategame-wise (if 2 Ezreals have same stats the one with fervor will beat the ones using different keystones). </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-12-13 18:55:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Guys I made this for myself and am FULLY aware that it's nowhere near perfect. I wasn't thinking about making it ''public'' but I feel like it will help some people. I know there are many guides online and this might not be any different from them (also the fact that I'm not high elo Ezreal player with 20k games on him), but yeah. Hope it helps.
AND YES, IT'S NOT COMPLETE. I'm looking for faults since like I said, I made it for myself :P 

Ezreal guide by Rom3
So I started one month before preseason 4 started and played on and off, picked Ezreal up during preseason 6 due to pros spamming him and seeing a lot of positive feedback about blue build Ezreal, which had always been my favourite adc. I've played close to 300 ranked games with him since and approx. 100 normal games which mainly consist of trying out different builds, going ap etc. I've played most of my games with Blue build Ezreal however, and that's what I'm mainly going to talk about. If you're higher rank than me or just for whatever reason think/know you know better, please let me know, I'm totally aware that I'm nowhere near good with this champion and I probably don't know even half of the stuff there is to know about. (Even though I've probably wasted 150-200 hours playing him. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ezreal abilities (what you use them for, not what they do)

Q - You use it for poking and last hitting, you should hit these to the point where its your autoattack and you RARELY them. It procs on hit effects such as BORK, wit's end, lich bane etc. It however doesn't apply rylais or DFT (this is why you don't take it even if you're playing ap ezreal). 

W - So if you're going ap this is your main source of damage, if not going ap however you'll mainly be using this to boost your attackspeed and give your allies attackspeed. How you do this is by w'ing a direction and then instantly e'ing into the same direction. W is also really good for poking, even though it doesn't do more than 50 damage, it's magic damage, doesn't trigger minion aggro AND you can combo it with quick sheen proc and instant auto attack.

E - One of the reasons some consider Ezreal ''easy'', in my opinion one of the most interesting adc abilities in the game since it can be used in so many different ways.
Ezreal's e as you all know is a channeled blink, but what some people might not know, is that ezreal is frozen in place while he's channeling it (so you can't be moved by thresh/blitz hooks, or ult etc. This makes the blink really interesting and seriously good tool to dodge skillshots. You have to note, that even though the cc won't affect you while you're casting, it will after the casting is done. Let's say you get hit by morganas q while channeling, you'll still move even though it hit you, but you'll also be snared for the normal duration after the blink.
Ezreal's e is also a big part of his damage as it deals magic damage, but procs muramana and scales off of ad, this is why you ALMOST NEVER want to waste it, even if you're e'ing away from your team you always want to look for ways you can still deal damage with it, but you'll realize how to do this after playing longer, it's something no guide can teach you.

R - Unless you know for a fact you're going to need this soon, don't keep it up. It's fairly good poke and waveclear and can be used to snipe buffs/pressure other lanes. It scales off of ad AND ap (90% bonus ap and 100% bonus ad, so ap Ezreal ult hurts more lategame) it also loses 10% of damage every time it deals damage, so try to not shoot it through minions when possible) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

(calculated using ezreal base stats @lvl 18.)
ezreal mana 1075
IBG 500
MURAMANA 1000 
=2575 (total mana with muramana ibg)
Trinity 250
=2325 (total mana with muramana triforce) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ezreal ad 96AD
runes 9.5AD
muramana 41,5
IBG 10
= 157 AD (total ad with muramana ibg)
Trinity 30
= 177AD (total ad with muramana trinity)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

On hit effect
Muramana 6% current mana = max:
IBG max on hit damage 154
IBG min on hit damage 30.9
Trinity max on hit damage 139
Trinity min on hit damage 27,9

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Items: Your basic 3 early game items are Doran's blade, refillable potion and tear of the goddess, pretty much all viable Ezreal builds include tear. In my opinion going IBG first is better, due to the dueling potential it gives you, I do however ALWAYS get manamune before the IBG because it gives pretty much no stats that help you win over sheen (the armor shouldn't matter as much because you're meant to poke them before engaging). So when would i go tri then? Personally i think trinity is great against Olaf and Zac, it gives you more DPS with your autoattacks and q, but less control and defense stats, but since these 2 will pretty much run trough everyone and can't be slowed effectively, the phage movespeed helps a lot, also helps with kiting.

So yeah, personally I enjoy going blue build ezreal because I'm super aggressive and I enjoy E'ing into them. I also tend to catch people with the slow a lot. (So muramana, ibg, ionian boots, lw (mortal or ldr depending on matchup) BORK and then one defensive item that suits the game (there's ALWAYS need for one if you ever get that far)

Also, if you want the slow, you can choose to get frozen mallet as defensive item and go trinity force, but i'd never really do that unless they have some bruisers that just run to you (so xin/jax etc.)

When BT over BORK? When they have people with low health pools, even though i never get bt because bork active has become part of my kit when playing Ezreal. 

Trinity + Frozen mallet? If you're fed but they have ad and ap burst you can go frozen mallet, but only if the passive is useful as well, so let's say you're fed and they do have ad and ap burst but the slow's complete useless so they have someone who jumps on you does its burst and then pretty much hits you until it can do it again (kata, akali, kha'zix, talon etc.) Keep in mind that usually getting frozen mallet as your defensive item isn't good because there's always something that suits the situation better. 

Boots? Ionian, they're the best option 99% of the time. As adc you won't really be able to use merc treads since if you get cc'd and don't qss it you're pretty much always dead.

Random stuff somewhat relevant:
Stacking tear perfectly takes 11 minutes and 7 seconds (FROM THE MOMENT YOU GET IT). Though not possible in actual game, worth keeping in mind. Minion waves spawn every 90 seconds and give (3x17.5+3x20.5+1/3x45) = 129,1666... gold (increasing overtime), which means that one minion wave is worth 129.1666+183,6=312,7666... This means that assuming you cs perfectly you can back approx. 4 minutes and 30 seconds into the game and buy tear + refillable, which should ALWAYS be your first back, no matter what (unless you get kills and get more items).

	<TEXT> Good tips, few suggestions though.

Always go IBG since it gives you defensive stats and we all, even me, even the best ones, overextend from time to time.

Ezreal's e is really interesting spell since it deals magic damage, scales off ap and ad AND procs muramana. What I'm trying to say here is that if possible, try to hit your e EVEN WHEN USING IT AS AN ESCAPE. This can be really tricky and lead to you getting killed but when you learn it it can be really useful. 

What comes to trading with other adc's, the rule i usually find working is that if i manage to hit 2 q's before he/she gets in range i can one shot her/him with e w q bork.

Edit:
Another thing, I feel like going sheen second after tear isn't good. Personally I have and always will prefer to have ad that helps me with trades and fighting over a sheen, since if i get sheen it basically means I CAN'T miss a SINGLE q or i wont  have any chance even when playing around the bushes etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> exactly! That tends to get harder in some matchups when going towards higher ranks, but gladly I'm not high ranked yet (p3-1) so I don't have to worrry about that haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, so what I meant by 'Don't poke with autoattacks' is that there are very few adc's that actually hurt less than Ezreal and thus you'll most likely get outpoked when you try to autoattack. Also you have your q and w for the poking, and the main thing you should pay attention to in your rank isn't poking and winning the lane like that, it's just farming. Trust me, it WILL help you in the long run :P. 

If Ezreal gets picked or banned then what? 
Personal preference in my opinion my second most played adc's were jhin and vayne, jhin simply because it was fairly simple, safe, had good scaling and well, it was considered really strong at the time. Vayne simply because I enjoy playing mechanical stuff (was draven main for a while).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeaah.. I guess it can work for you but not being able to stack it with w and e during laning phase made me never pick it again lol </TEXT>
