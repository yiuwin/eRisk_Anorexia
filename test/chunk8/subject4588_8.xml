	<TEXT> This isn't so much about spelling. It could be that you're writing the email and you accidentally send it with the message half written. Alternatively, you could write the email in the client itself without filling in who you're sending it to. I've found the copy + paste method helpful because it forces me to reread *what* I'm about to transfer, and allows me to check for things like cogency and tone.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> LPT: If you're looking for housing, watch out for scams that ask you for a cash deposit right away but can only show you the exterior of the house/apartment. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-03 18:13:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The listing usually appears as follows: people are renting a place for a really low price relative to the market (usually a red flag). However, for some reason (e.g. they have moved away) they can't show you the inside of the house. Usually someone already lives there (and their info has been compromised) or the house is abandoned.

I live in a college town, and these scammers prey on unsuspecting college students who are (reasonably) looking for affordable housing. People suck. </TEXT>
