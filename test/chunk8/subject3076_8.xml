I can really relate to the place that you are at right now. I was so scared and tired, and I just wanted someone to tell me that things got better.

For me things got a lot better. I was 25 when I got sober, and I consider myself healthier than I was before I started drinking.

I could have quit when I was your age, but I didn't. I am not going to try and scare you into quitting now: it's entirely your decision. That's what is so scary and awesome about recovery: It is entirely up to you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a lot of different ways that people find ways to destress. I don't think there is anything wrong with masturbating. I always make sure though, that I balance masturbation with other things. If one activity starts to take more time and energy, and I start feeling obsessive about it: that's when I stop and go, "Whoa, does something needs to change?"

I kept my head to the ground, did the work I needed to do and tried not to worry about how other people would react. I can't control how people react! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's true. I think it's partly accurate: my drinking certainly negatively influenced my health and life to a HUGE degree. And at the same time, I realized that many people in daily life suffer from headaches, gut pain etc...all because we live such busy lives and many of us are shit at taking care of ourselves.

That being said, we all make a lot of misattributions. I think that my headache today was caused by X, but like, how the fuck do I know that? 

I think I need to believe that my actions have some bearing on my physiology. I think I need to believe that I have some amount of control/influence into how I feel. But who knows?

	<TEXT> Thanks for venting. I quit when I was 25 years old. 

I went to an inpatient facility that was a good 7-8 hour drive away. I don't regret it at all. When I got back, I was sober and so I was open to all sorts of community based programming. I ended up doing outpatient therapy once a week for 10 months and I loved it. 

I didn't really have an "ah-ha" moment or anything until I was in rehab. I was pretty depressed and borderline suicidal by the end of my drinking career: exhausted and just going through the motions.

	<TEXT> Welcome. I started in a similiar position. I was 25 and depended on my parent's for their help with medications etc. I can honestly say that the best way of repaying their unending kindness was me getting sober and starting a program of recovery.

I've had anxiety since I began to form memories. Alcohol helped me escape anxiety, but it backfired. No one taught me how to handle the level of mental pain I was feeling. 

I got sober by getting into a treatment program and then learning how to self-regulate. I also decided to start taking my mental health problems seriously. Doing all of this has resulted in a life with less suffering: but now I am able to handle it, cope and move on.

I wish you the best on your journey. I don't regret any day I've spent sober. </TEXT>

She might need this for her health and everyone else's sanity. But she might not be ready. Yes it sounds insane, but that's addiction.

No one forced me to get sober. There were no strategies people used that forced me to stop drinking.

	<TEXT> In my opinion when people say things like this to me, it means that they have entered into the same mindframe as telling an addict what to do...which means venturing away from support and listening, into giving direct advice.

It sounds nice to tell someone they need to take better care of themselves. But it's the same fucking thing as telling an addict: "You just need to stop"

I've seen this from counsellors and therapists as well. They will use all the motivational interviewing, active listening skills, etc etc for the addict...but then the family gets a quick "Yah you need to do this" or "You need to set boundaries" </TEXT>

There's no goalposts I need to meet. I don't need to own a home before I am 30 to prove to anyone who I am and what I am worth.

Alcohol stunted my growth: professionally, spiritually, mentally, psychologically and physically. 

The only thing I can do is put in the sober time and do my best to pull myself out of the shit.

I waitressed. I bartended. I worked minimum wage jobs. I felt like a LOSER infront of my husband's friends and family. But fuck my shame. Work is work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only way I'd ever reset my badge is if I consciously drank alcohol. How drunk I got wouldn't be a factor. 

That is solely my opinion on MY badge.

Badges on SD are to be used how you deem appropriate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My addiction doctor in inpatient decreased my antidepressants dose and I was concerned. I talked to them about it and they explained the why, and then I dealt with the consequences. 

Inpatient has a lot of rules for a reason. They also like patients who are agreeable to their terms, because to them it shows a willingness to listen and learn. That being said, I was completely within my rights to question what I was being asked to ingest. But I understand that a refusal to follow their directives could have resulted in a discharge.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was reluctant to go for similar reasons. I actually drove a little outside town for the first couple, and then generally came in closer when I got more confidence.

I hope you find some relief soon. My first few AA meetings I really hated, to be honest haha, but then I ended up loving them.

I also went to group therapy at my local addiction agency. I imagine this brings up similar worries for you :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seeing a lot of posts with these self defeating / self sabotaging / excuse words.

I know you mean this in a nice way, but it could come cross as quite negative. Meaning you're almost saying "you shouldn't do this"

One of the guidelines is to not critique other people's posts. Could you please remove this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me the answer wasn't actually about HOW I quit. It was about the things I did for my mental and psychological life. 

It wasn't about the booze. Booze was simply an avenue to oblivion/thoughtlessness/escaping pain and encountering pain and the endless cycling between craving and relief.

I couldn't stay quit without a support group, some psychological help, a medical way to treat the cravings and changing my attitude and perspective on life.

It seems like a lot, but it was a hell of a lot easier than the countless cycles of hate and relief, hate and relief. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Restaurant industry is tough. I managed to get out and am a lot happier, but I did serve to make money for our wedding and really enjoyed it sober!

As for my story, I had applied to go to rehab because everyone was kind of telling me I needed to go. I was kicked out of my boyfriend's place and wasn't allowed to drink at my parent's house. So I drank outside and snuck into the house at night, when I wasn't being brought to different detoxes and family members homes. It sucked.

I got the call I was going to rehab on the next Monday. So on Friday night (May 27th, 2011) I had a particularly pathetic night of drinking, where I didn't really want to drink, but "had to." Woke up the next morning and something had just broken inside of me. 

I went to rehab not really sure I wanted to get sober. But once I was there I really settled in well and loved it. I felt like other addicts understood me. Like I had found my tribe of misfits. I haven't looked back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> However, I'm not even entirely sure how to live a life that doesn't involve drinking, at least in terms of socializing and spending time with my peers.

This has been the hardest and also most rewarding part of getting sober. I realized that there are TONS of people out there who don't drink to socialize. I also learned about how to be sober in a world that drinks. 

All that I need to do is be firm in my conviction to never drink, and then really try to experience life fully. I socialize better than I ever did, because I am not hitting on everyone's boyfriend/girlfriend and making a fool out of myself. </TEXT>
