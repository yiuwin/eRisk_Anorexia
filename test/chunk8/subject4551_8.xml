	<TEXT> from where AFC started, I don't think any team has achieved it. 

From division 4 to the top tier has been done a few times; Swansea, Watford, Blackpool, Bournemouth off the top of my head. 

Yeovil managed to go from what is now the Conference South to the Championship. That's about as good as it's got, as far as I know - it's mightily difficult for a small club to survive above league 1.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was lucky enough to study a couple of courses given by Judith Keene who wrote the marvellous "Fighting for Franco" about volunteers on the Nationalist side. It's an outstanding book, about something which isn't hugely well known http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fighting-For-Franco-International-Nationalist/dp/1852855932

Homage to Catalonia is my favourite book of all time. 

I've also just finished "Telegram from Guernica" which a biography of GL Steer, the Times foreign correspondent who broke the news of the German bombing of the town. It's about Abyssinia   some WW2 as well. It's an excellent book though http://www.amazon.co.uk/Telegram-Guernica-Extraordinary-George-Correspondent/dp/0571298869/ref=sr_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1459620430 sr=1-1 keywords=telegram+from+guernica </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you think that if players were regularly toppling down there that it wouldn't have been addressed? Up until the start of this season, I'd missed *maybe* 50 games in the last twenty years. If there was some list of dead   dying players, a google of "player falling in the lower Rous at Watford" would produce something. It doesn't. Given the health   safety concious nature of stadia design, if they thought there was a large risk, it would've been dealt with years ago. It hasn't, because THIS HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE. There will *possibly* be changes (although I'm not sure what) for the next game, but there's not alot you can do when a stand has been built following a slope. 

It's the oldest stand in the stadium now, and I'd wager that it's the next to be demolished as part of the extension plans for the stadium, but that ain't happening for a couple of years at least. I'm willing to bet that in that time, Ake will remain the only player to fall in there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not a pit. The western stand at Vicarage follows the slope from north to south. As a result, there's a significant fall there. It's been there for 30 years, and as far as I know, this has never happened before. Certainly not in the 20 odd years I've been going, anyway </TEXT>

Spain is all about technical ball playing   skills.

Premier League/ English football is historically known as physical and more direct than other European leagues. 

Germany   France aren't (in my limited knowledge) really known for particular characteristics in the way Spain, Italy   England are. The best German teams play good football but can also mix it with the best.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  At Watford, I'm absolutely convinced that Gifton Noel-Williams would've been capped for England if his knee wasn't destroyed by Paul Butler. Had 14 goals by January in his first season at division one (Championship) level at 18/19, was constantly improving. Strong as an ox, great in the air and capable of scoring goals like this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-qAsSt6dyc)

Had his knee destroyed about ten minutes later, spent a year or more out and was never the same player. 

I'm convinced that he'd have been twice the player Emile Heskey was (I know that sounds like damning with faint praise, but given he spent a good deal of the 00s playing for England as the big lump for Owen/Rooney/someone else to play off of, I think it's a good comparison) </TEXT>

I've since spoken to other people who worked at the club during the Baz reign, and apparently he used to pay the builders of the Red Lion with cash from the bar takings, and things got so tight with regards to paying bills that one of the managers of the catering used to have to HIDE THE CASH (!!!!) from Baz so she could use it to actually pay suppliers.  </TEXT>
