	<TEXT> You need to study the Torah properly before you start coming to your own conclusions. I'm not sure how you come to the conclusion that God loves killing people a lot because in the same Torah it says that God is all merciful and just.

	<TEXT> There is a story In the Talmud that a man came to shamai who was a great sage and asked him can you teach me the whole Torah (bible) on 1 foot so he got upset and told him to go away so this man went to the next sage hillel who was known to be a very kind man and he asked him the same question can you teach me the whole Torah on one foot so hillel said whatever you hate for yourself do not do to your friend and the rest is commentary. 

The commentaries on the Talmud explain this story that obviously you can't try to understand or know the whole Torah quickly it takes a lot of time to study everything and understand everything and hillel was teaching him a lesson that you have to know before you begin studying and once you have to this lesson engraved inside of you then you can begin studying. </TEXT>
