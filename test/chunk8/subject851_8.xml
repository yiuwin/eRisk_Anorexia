	<TEXT> Well Lightning could, with great difficulty. Can't activate the banish effect because of Lightning preventing effects from being activated during the damage step. Getting over 5000 atk for Radiant (much better name, as  pointed out) requires 17 monsters. Takes too long, if even possible and Lightning is lightning fast to come to the field. You can't even negate his effect because again, card effects cannot be activated during the damage step. 

The challenge lies in getting him on the field. Imagine a field of Radiant, {{Dark Matter Dragon}} and {{Amorphage Goliath}}, with {{Return of the Dragon Lords}} in the grave and the occasional {{Cyber Dragon Infinity}}. That's something easily achievable. No way you are recovering from that. 

Ferret flames could counter Radiant. Skill Drain could also, but only if you flipped it up before Radiant hit the field. Interesting options are Lullaby of Obedience, Prohibition, Mind Crush and the like. Prevent the card from ever hitting the field, because once it does, you are about to lose. Perhaps there should be a clause that the negation effect cannot be used during damage calculation. That way, Honest or Honesty Neos could push for game. 

What's worse is that seen how things are going, Konami might actually make such a card for some other archetype. Did you see the new cards that HEROES are getting in Duelist Saga? Basically two three plus twoes in Vyon and Legacy of a Hero.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not meant to be. You'd have to banish a Blue-Eyes fusion to summon it, but I was thinking of Twin Burst when I wrote that. Card might get some actual use that way. 

And I'm biased towards Blue-Eyes. I've been playing the deck for years. From Summoned Skull beatdown to the Airblade Turbo, and everything in between. Rather annoyed with physical cards and lacking people to play with, I skipped TeleDAD era (which I really regret. After Blue-Eyes decks, TeleDAD decks are my favourite to play). 

When I discovered DN I got back into the game, and that was when the DRulers were freshly limited. Mirror force was limited, or semi-limited -I can't remember anymore. God was that an era I loved playing in. DRulers gave such versatility, even at one, that they allowed you to come back from any situation and win. I lost very rarely with that deck; for the first time, my Blue-Eyes was actually winning a lot. I played that till the DRulers got banned. 

At which point, between Qlis, Tellarknight and Shaddolls, Blue-Eyes had no chance. I was using a lot of different versions: Disaster, Chaos and what not. For whatever reason I never thought of Blue-Eyes Shaddolls back then. It's really, really bothersome to see some Red-Eyes get support, which was infinitely better than what the Blue-Eyes had at the time. 

Finally, when the new Blue-Eyes support was released, Blue-Eyes became viable again. It became tier 1. For some time at least. Whatever came afterwards knocked it lower, but at least it's much, much stronger than before. Not as strong as it was with the 4 Drulers, but still, incomparable to what it was before. Currently waiting for Construct to come off the banlist. It's funny how new cards do that: before I really wanted to see Construct banned, and now I'd be really happy if she came off the list. 

So this card represents the frustration of playing a losing deck, a hopeless case for years, finally seeing something good come out of it, only to lose it again. It was never meant to be balanced. Plus, Blue-Eyes is somewhat resistant to the banlist because it is one of the two icons of yugioh (thanks Kaiba) so this card might be limited, at worst, but I doubt it will be banned. And limiting this is somewhat moot, because with access to 3 draw cards, a risky pot of desires, sometimes Cards of Consonance, the ability to run Upstart and kill the opponent anyway, and of course Melody, this card will end up in your hand very quickly. 

And it's not like it's that busted either. Towers was unaffected by Spells, Traps and monsters with a lower level, which was pretty much everything relevant at the time. It was extremely searchable: 3 scout, 3 summoner's, 3 saquli, duality, and easily summoned.

	<TEXT> Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon. 

The art is great, and the effect is not terrible. I mean, immune to targeting and gains large attack. Also searchable with melody. 

However, the cost of the summon is enormous. I'll not have enough dragons in my graveyard for a large attack either. Only targeted protection is weak. 

It's really maddening that it is so mediocre. The way they touted the card in the movie would have you think it would have something better. It's probably the worst of the blue-eyes archetype cards. 

If only there was a retrained version:

Blue-Eyes Dazzling Dragon:

Light/8/Dragon/3000/2500/Effect:

Cannot be normal summoned/set. Must be special summoned by banishing one face up "Blue-Eyes" Fusion Monster you control, and cannot be special summoned by other ways. This card's summon cannot be negated. Unaffected by other card effects. Cannot be tributed. This card gains 300 attack points for every "Blue-Eyes" monster and every "Eyes of Blue" monster in your graveyard and on your field, except this card. Up to twice per turn: if this card would be destroyed by battle, you can banish the monster that battled this card instead. Once per turn: when your opponent activates a card or effect or summons a monster: you can send one "Blue-Eyes" or "Eyes of Blue" monster from your deck to the graveyard, negate the activation or summon, and if you do, destroy it. Once per turn: you can target one face-up card on the field: negate its effects until the end phase of the next turn.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DBZ is long, and the filler is inconsistent with the rest of the series. Plus, unless you are watching sub, the translation changes from the source material a lot. On the other hand, the music is awesome, you'll not run out of episodes anytime soon, and even the filler is not bad. 

DBKai is much shorter, but the visual quality is higher, the translation is more faithful to the original, and the series has consistency.

	<TEXT> In the eyes of the Germans, Hitler was what they needed. They lost their government in the war, had some foreign government imposed upon them which threw them into debt (though that was after having rebuilt German economy. Great Depression hits hard), went from being one of the most powerful countries in the world to having less strength than a little girl, had enraged bullying and practically thieving neighbours that could have attacked Germany at any time, a crumbling economy, which they saw as the fault of the democratic government, lost plenty of territory, and to add salt to the wound, lost Saar and Rhineland which could have helped rebuilt Germany, and were blamed entirely for a war that wasn't really their fault. 

They believed they needed a strong government, an extremist one. Hitler was that guy. He presented his views in Mein Kampf and demonstrated, by the Beer Putsch, that he was not one to lay idle. Hindenburg and von Papen wanted a puppet and they thought Hitler was the one; he was practically offered his position on a plate. 

Once there, Germans were more reassured, and Hitler actually cared about the country. Hitler focused on the Aryan Master Race, but only so that he could guarantee them a quality of life. In view of this, he made multiple improvements to Germany. Other than those already mentioned he also introduced the Volkswagen, or "people's car". He reduced unemployment by creating new jobs as well.  </TEXT>

Then again, beyond a certain point, I try not to get involved in such discussions, because I feel they are a waste of my time. I understand their overall importance, but I feel like it's not my responsibility to do that.

Binary ten has the same numerical value as decimal 2, and because we can convert from one base to another, it means we would rather recognise numbers in terms of their value.

	<TEXT> The way I would say it is that energy is simply an abstract concept. It's this number that we can calculate and then we can use it to make predictions. After all, energy is something we invented, it has no physical basis. We discovered that the energy is conserved (that's something that we don't get to choose), so it becomes a useful quantity, we give it a name and we calculate numbers. 

It's amazing how by calculating artificial numbers on a piece of paper I can predict the world around me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But does absolute truth even matter or exist?

I mean, for a theory to endure tests for a certain period of time, the results must have worked in some realm. Newtonian physics is a good example, because it lasted for 300 years or so, and is still used as a very good approximation. 

Furthermore, there is inherent uncertainty associated with our measurements: our instruments can only be so accurate. This means that for different cases different decimal points matter, so an absolute truth would make no difference for these cases.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It should be true that the higher you are, the lower the required velocity to orbit. 

Consider the way the orbit works: gravity tries to pull you down to the planet, but because of your tangential velocity, you miss the planet and thus orbit it. The tangential velocity has to be such that it allows you to cover enough tangential distance before you reach the planet, so that you can miss the planet.

The larger the force, the faster you fall. And if you are falling faster, it means you have less time to move out of the way of the planet. Therefore, you need a larger tangential velocity. Furthermore, the closer you are to the planet, the less distance you need to travel to get to it, which means that you again have less time to move out of the way. 

Turning the statement on the head shows that the tangential velocity should be smaller the further away you are from the planet because not only is there more distance to cover to get to the planet, the gravitational force weakens as you get away. 

However, if you were to compare the velocity needed to reach two different orbits, you'd require a larger velocity to reach the larger orbit. That's because the Earth's gravity would slow you down as you move towards your orbit, so you need a larger initial velocity to get there. The velocity you'd actually need to orbit is smaller for the larger orbit though.

	<TEXT> The information transit would still be a problem. You could set t = t' when the frames are coincident, but in that case that would mean both the spaceship and the Earth were in the same place when they started the clocks. 
Any step taken to synchronise clocks unless they were in the same location would take some time and it would be impossible to solve this. 

You'd need some event to synchronise the clocks. In this case the event is the emission of light. Earth could account for when the light arrived and thus when to set their t_1 = 0. But they would also have to account for when the spaceship set their t'_1 =0. From the point of view of Earth, the spaceship set their t'_1 = 0 before Earth, which is why the Lorentz transform gives a negative answer. The spaceship knew about the emission before Earth. By using the Lorentz transform, Earth could indeed account for the early start, but then they wouldn't be measuring the time between the two events. They would be measuring slightly more than that time. 

From the point of view of the spaceship, they could set their clocks at t'_1 = 0, when the beam is emitted. However, they would see Earth setting their clock a little bit later. Even if Earth corrects for the delay, the spaceship would not know about it till afterwards and it would seem too late. It's physically impossible for Earth and the spaceship to synchronise their clocks, because information travels at the speed of light. 

The Earth cannot set its clocks at t=0 at the same time as the spaceship if it wants to measure the time interval between the two events. For Earth: the beam was not emitted till they were able to see it, so even if they did set t = 0 = t', they wouldn't record the emission of the beam at t = 0, but a little later than that.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Where is the kinetic energy stored during an inelastic collision? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello. 

Suppose there are two balls of equal mass and velocity moving towards each other, and they collide inelastically. They stick together and remain stationary after the collision. There's some heat involved and they deform to stick together. Their kinetic energy has been converted into other forms of energy. There's no issue here. Assuming that no energy is lost to the surroundings, it is also given that their total energy is 2KE, where KE is the kinetic energy of one ball. 

But suppose we look at the centre of mass during the entire collision. The centre of mass has zero velocity throughout, so its KE = 0. It's a point particle, so there's no way it can hide energy in temperature or deformities. There's no force field involved for it to have potential energy. Therefore, it seems to me that the net energy of the centre of mass is zero. 

If that's the case, this means that the system cannot do work. But consider the same set-up, except that instead of the balls flying towards each other, they fly away from each other. They could collide with something else, and transfer energy to them. Thus, they would have done work. But the energy of the centre of mass did not change, if it does not store energy.

If the centre did store the energy somehow, there would be a change in stored energy that would allow for work to be done. Is there a way in which the centre stores energy? I know that relativistically, the centre of mass has a mass larger than that of its constituents, so there would be a mass deficit if its constituents did work. But I never heard of any such thing classically. 

Thanks for answering.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The value of potential energy is arbitrary, so asking whether it has a specific value at a certain point doesn't really mean anything. That being said, I kind of get the question because I had the same question myself before: what is the significance of zero force?

As you already mentioned, zero force means a maximum or minimum for the potential. This means that if you moved a little bit from where you are, you wouldn't gain much kinetic energy: your speed doesn't change much. If the potential energy is a maximum, this doesn't last long: your KE and speed snowballs, and hence a maximum potential is very unstable. The slightest disturbance could get you to move. If the forces grow larger as you move away in either direction (down a hill for example), the potential energy was a maximum. If the forces get smaller on either side (up a trough for example), it's a minimum and you'll need a large push to get away. You would be very stable in such conditions.

An example of such a situation is the point between two protons. There is no force at the midpoint because either proton will repel a test charge there with the same force. Yet, if you imagined yourself bringing the test charge from infinity, you'd see that you'd have to push the test charge hardest to bring it to the midpoint. Thus it has the highest potential energy possible there. If you moved the test charge a little bit to the right or the left, there would be a very small force at first, but as it pushes the test charge, the force would get progressively stronger and stronger. There would be no going back to the midpoint.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The mistake is in assuming t_1 = t'_1. It's physically impossible for them to be equal. 

When you start the clock, you start it because you saw the light beam being emitted. On the spaceship, there's no issue because you are right there, so your clock can be set to t'_1 = 0. However, for Earth, there must be a delay between the signal being emitted on the spaceship, and Earth realising that the signal has been emitted. Information cannot propagate instantly. Therefore Earth starts its clock a little bit later than the spaceship, so t_1  t'_1. 

If you do set t_1 = 0 on Earth, using the Lorentz transform you obtain t'_1 = -yud/c^2 where y is the gamma factor. 

Then, when you calculate t'  t'_2. It's slightly larger than that. Therefore method 2 is invalid. Method one works and gives the answer. I verified it by adapting method 2 to the new t' and solving for d. The answer is the same in both cases.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ginger, and roots from its family, can be used to remove blood.
Just like ginger, meat tenderisers can also be used. Meat tenderisers, ginger and so on contain an enzyme (or enzymes for some) that can break down protein, thus softening meat or getting rid of evidence. 

As already mentioned, hydrogen peroxide can be used to get rid of blood stains. Household cleaners, such as "Oxiclean", contain a lot of oxygen. The chemical reaction between haemoglobin and oxygen is used as a test for blood. If you trigger this reaction by flooding haemoglobin with oxygen for example, the detection fails. Some household cleaners react with water, releasing plenty of oxygen and thus render the blood tests useless. Hydrogen peroxide gets rid of visible stains in that way. 

Other reactions can also damage the blood. Coke (the soda) and salted water can help clean bloodstains, but only if you apply them quickly. If the blood has dried and hardened, you can use enzyme killers, or digest the blood using meat tenderisers to make cleaning easier. 

Luminol testing is a common form of blood detecting. It reacts with the iron in blood. Using something like bleach can get rid of the iron, and thus make blood impervious to luminol testing </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello.

I am interested in the physics of ink flow, specifically in fountain pens, but other contexts would be interesting to read about, and might provide an insight in my interest. 

I've found two papers so far, or at least articles about the papers: https://phys.org/news/2011-11-hydrodynamics-ink.html
and 
https://phys.org/news/2011-12-deconstruct-physics-fountain-pen.html

I have an idea of the basic workings (capillary action, how air fills in the pen, etc.), but I would be interested in more detailed research. 

Anyone has any paper about that?

Thanks for answering.  </TEXT>

Calculate the resultant on B, from the 100 N force. I'll call that R_B

Calculate the force on A due to the 100 N string. (I.e, as if F1 and F2 weren't there). I'll call this F_A. The net force on A is then F_A + F1 + F2 = R_A. (I haven't checked signs. Adjust according to direction of the forces)

Then since R_A = R_B, F_A + F1 + F2 = R_B, and F1 + F2 = R_B - F_A.

Then you can split in vertical and horizontal components and find F1 and F2.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well there is this rotating disc, and it can rotate clockwise and anticlockwise. But it can also rotate in different orientations. For example it could lay flat and rotate in that orientation, or it could be completely vertical. 
If you stuck a rod through it, there's only one way for you to stick that rod such that the object rotates around the rod, and that way depends on orientation. So an arrow sticking in the direction of the rod will describe the orientation of the object. And if you add a sign to that arrow, you can say whether the thing is rotating clockwise or not. That arrow is the axial vector.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The quantity T/r' is the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to the velocity. r' = dr/dt, where r is the position. (Keep in mind that when I say position, velocity etc... I really mean it for generalised coordinates. So r could be the angle and r' could be angular velocity if the situation calls for it. I'm just using the usual terms for simplicity). So you could define a v = dr/dt then rewrite it as T/v. It's just clearer with r'. 
d/dt(T/r') means differentiate T with respect to r', then differentiate that with respect to time. 

An example: suppose T = 1/2mv^2, and r is the position. Then r' = dr/dt = v, so T/r' = mv. 

d/dt(T/r') would then be mdv/dt (assuming mass is constant). 

To derive the expression requires some knowledge of the calculus of variations. 

There is a principle in physics, called the principle of least action which states that there is a quantity called the action: S = Ldt (from t_0 to t_1) (L is the Lagrangian, t_0 is the initial time and t_1 is the final time), and that for any  system, the action will be a stationary point. That is the action is either a maximum, or a minimum (hence least action. A little of a misnomer because the action is just a stationary point, not always least), or a stationary inflection point. Don't ask me why - I have no idea of why it works. 

The laws of physics can then be written in this form: you take an action, and try to optimise it and the laws of physics will pop out from there. The Lagrangian is a function; when you get the correct form for the function, you optimise the action. Therefore this is not a classical optimisation problem; in a classical one you are trying to optimise a function with respect to a variable's value. Here you are trying to optimise a function with respect to the form of a function. Functions whose value depends on the form of another function are called functionals. 

How then to proceed? Well, the idea behind df/dx = 0 at a stationary point in classical optimisation is that if you changed X (X is the value such that f(X) = optimum.) by a very small amount, there is practically no change in f. We can use this idea: for the right Lagrangian, if we change our quantities a little bit, a variation in them, we find that the change in S is zero to the first order expansion (there is no change in the linear approximation of S, which is the first two terms of it's Taylor expansion). When we apply this idea, we get this equation:

d/dt (L/r') = L/r

this is called the Euler-Lagrange equations. The post is too long, so I won't post the exact derivation. The Wikipedia article called Hamilton's principle (the principle is just that of least action) has a nice derivation. The Feynman lectures Volume II chapter 19(If I remember correctly. It was called "A special lecture) or so gives a better explanation of the logic behind. 

Now for the derivation of your equation.

It turns out that in classical physics, the Lagrangian that satisfies the above equation is of the form T - U, where T is the kinetic energy and U is the potential energy. Of course, all is in generalised coordinates. 

So you can plug that in the Euler-Lagrange equation above:

d/dt((T - U)/r') = (T - U)/r.

In general potential energy does not depend on the (generalised) velocity of the object. If you make this assumption the above becomes:

d/dt(T/r') = T/r - U/r

where I split the right hand side. Then you can look at the definition of potential energy mathematically:
potential energy is defined such that the negative derivative of the energy with respect to a coordinate gives the force in that direction:

     -U/r = F, by definition of U. 

So for example, if r represents the position on the x-axis, then the derivative of U with respect to r gives the force in the x-direction. If r is a generalised coordinate, then F would be the generalised force. 

If you apply that to the previous equation, you get:

d/dt(T/r') = T/r + F

Move the T/r to the left to get the equation. Everything is in generalised coordinates. 

So the idea behind the equation is that there is this quantity called the action, and that any physical system will always have an optimum action, be it a minimum, maximum, or stationary point of inflection. Then from there, with the proper Lagrangian you get this equation. Why it works I have no idea.

A few post-scriptum notes:

-The Lagrangian, by definition, is a function of r, r' and t. When you vary the Lagrangian to derive the Euler-Lagrange equations, what you are doing is changing r by dr and so on. This corresponds to looking at a path that is very close to the real one. For instance, if your path is a straight line, by varying L, you are calculating the action for a path that could have a very, very slight curvature. 

-The principle of least action surprisingly works for any kind of physics provided you tweak the Lagrangian. For instance in relative, the Lagrangian is -mc^2/y where y is the gamma factor and c is the speed of light. 

-There is another derivation of your equation, using the principle of virtual work and its extension, the d'Alembert principle. The principle of virtual work basically says that if you have a system where everything is stationary, and the net force is zero, you can imagine a small displacement dr in things in the system, such that dr is physically possible (solids can't go through solids for example) and that the system is in static equilibrium afterwards. This is a "virtual" displacement, and for this displacement the work done, the "virtual" work will be zero. This makes sense: for something to move from static equilibrium to static equilibrium, no work must have been done on it. 
D'Alembert's principle says the same thing, but it says that if there are forces in the system, you can move to a non-inertial frame so that there seems to be no force in the system, and the principle will hold. Goldstein's classical mechanics details it. Feynman lectures Volume I chapter 4 talks about virtual work.

-If you are interested in learning more about Lagrangian formalism, Landau and Lifshitz textbooks on physics are excellent for that. I can't find the link right now, but there were posted somewhere on Reddit. Either way it is on archive.org.

If you need any more clarifications, feel free to ask. This is a long post so I probably missed out on something. And sorry that it's not exactly adapted to 5-year olds  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They have the same frequency because the force is proportional to the horizontal distance away from the vertical, by Hooke's law. 

Whatever factor you multiply this horizontal distance by, you multiply the force by the same factor. Say you double that horizontal distance: you have twice the distance, but also twice the force and thus twice the acceleration. The net result is that you take the same time to cover that distance, so the oscillation rate remains the same. 

The horizontal distance is related to the length of the string and the angle from the vertical by trigonometry: x  = L sin . So if you change the angle, you are changing x, and thus changing F as well by the same factor. Then the acceleration changes by the same factor so the time taken is constant. 

Another way to see this is by considering energy. You could double the height of the pendulum by changing the angle and thus double its energy. Then this energy is converted into kinetic energy. Doubling the kinetic energy corresponds to multiplying the velocity by a factor of 2. The work done is doubled, because kinetic energy = work done, and since work done = force times distance, and by Hooke's law F = kx, both the force and x must be multiplied by 2. Therefore, the power is also multiplied by 2 (force times velocity = power). If the work done and the power are both multiplied by 2, then the time over which energy is transferred, the period must be the same. Therefore, the two pendulums must have the same period.

	<TEXT> Thanks. 

The Feynman lectures are actually books. They are based upon the lectures that Richard Feynman delivered to freshmen in Caltech. They are available for free on Caltech's website. 

I usually read the lectures when studying. Whenever there is something interesting that I'd like to investigate further or something that is confusing, I stop, and start thinking about it. I try to understand what he says. He used to confuse me for days when I first started, then it reduced to hours and finally a few minutes now and then. When you try to clear up confusion, it really helps consolidate the concepts and reveal the reasoning behind. I don't make notes of the lectures in general, because most of the information is readily accessible so I don't see why I would. That's personal preference of course. However, in cases where something is confusing I do make notes about the reasoning. But what's more important is the process of reasoning, because that helps develop the skills that you need. 

Occasionally when I see something, I try and explain what's going on. That's one of Feynman's recommendations actually; to choose something you like and study it for fun. It propels the development of your skills by miles, and it's fun. IB past papers are meant for something similar, but this helps much, much more. Of course, you still need IB papers, but that's more related to how IB wants your answers rather than just content. 

When going through my notes, I noticed that most of them are on relativity or Lagrangian mechanics for some reason. So if you are taking option A for physics I have quite a few good websites. If not, I don't really have any recommendations because I use the Feynman lectures as a main resource. When in doubt, I check random sites, because they seem more or less equal in performance. So I don't have any recommendations for this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anything by Feynman in general is excellent. Even the methods he uses to study by himself produce astounding results. For instance, he suggests that you take something that interests you and that you work it out. In general practice is required to learn concepts. Here you are practising but in a way that makes you learn much faster because it is interesting for you, and you have to be much more engaged since you are finding a general solution rather than just solving a number. 

Textbooks that he used are excellent too. Calculus for the practical man (available on Gutenberg and archive) is perfect to learn calculus. 

Otherwise not much. Landau and Lifshitz textbooks are also great for learning physics, but they are well above the level of IB. They are meant for grad students  after all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have done addmaths for GCSEs or if you did calculus in SL you should be fine. When he does use integration by parts, it's usually not something that's relevant for IB. If you haven't done calculus, it might be harder to follow his lectures, specifically equation derivations and some of his arguments but you can still extract a lot from them. It would then be up to you to see if you think that reading the lectures is beneficial to you or whether they just confuse you. 

As an aside I can try giving a crash course on multivariable calculus and integration by parts. 

Basically the whole idea of integration by parts is to reverse the product rule. Lets say you have some function U and another V. Then by the product rule:

d(UV) = VdU + UdV. 

Now say you have a function UdV and you want to find UdV. Then from the above:

UdV = d(UV) - VdU

UdV = d(UV) - VdU

UdV = UV - VdU and that's the general idea. Lets give it a try: say you have 2x sin x and you want to integrate this:

x sin x dx. 

You can rewrite sin x dx as d(-cos x) because the derivative of - cos x is sin x. Then if you rewrite your function:

x d(- cos x) which is of the form UdV where U = x and V = - cos x. 

Therefore UV = -xcos x.
Then we need dU. Since U = x dU = dx. Therefore VdU = - cos x dx, -VdU = cos x dx and -VdU = cos x dx = sin x. Then you sum UV and -VdU to get:

x sin x dx = sin x - x cos x, which is the answer. So you basically reverse the product rule to get the answer. That's the essential idea behind integration by parts. You'll need to apply the general idea of integration by parts more often in the lectures, rather than use it to solve problems as in the example. For instance perhaps you have PdV where P is the pressure and V  the volume and you want VdP. You could use integration by parts to find that VdP = d(PV) - PdV. In these cases the product rule can give the answer just as easily. 




There is some multivariable calculus involved in the book, but multivariable calculus itself is generally not too hard to follow. The idea is that while one variable changes, the other one remains constant. For instance say you have x^2 + y^2. If x and y aren't related to each other, you could treat y as a constant and differentiate with respect to x to get 2x, or you could treat x as a constant and differentiate with respect to y to get 2y. Because you are only differentiating with respect to one variable its called partial differentiation and is written as f/x if you are differentiating with respect to x and f/y if it is with respect to y. 

Now what if you wanted the whole differentiation? Then you'd have to parameterise x and y. That is, you express x and y as two different functions of some parameter t. Then you differentiate with respect to t. This time it's the whole derivative. For instance x could = t^2 and y = t^3. Then df/dt = 4t^3 + 6t^5. Choosing the functions for t depends on how x and y are changing, which you generally are told about. It's similar to parameterising planes, because graphically that's what you are doing. In fact graphically, the function f(x,y) may be represented as a plane, and t would then be the parameter you use to parameterise the plane. 

The main idea here is that you can treat each variable as separate if they are not related to each other. If y was related to x, then y would be a function of x and you'd have to apply the chain rule. 

Multivariable integration is also used, but he doesn't use it in terms of two variables. For instance some integrals can be written as f(x,y)dxdy, where f is integrated with respect to both x and y. But dxdy = dA where A is the area so you could rewrite f(x,y) as f(A) and then integrate. 


Don't let all the talk above put you off. I'm not a great explainer, he is. Either way both concepts are used sparingly in the lectures (except the idea that in multivariable functions, each variable can be treated as constant with respect to other; ie, that d(x + y) can be written as dx + dy), and when he does use them, he tends to go into detail. He actually gives a crash course in vector calculus, imaginary numbers, probability, vector algebra and calculus of variations at different points in the book. 

 If you feel like you might want to brush up on your calculus skills as well, I suggest the textbook Calculus for the practical man, which is available for download on Gutenberg.org. It probably is available on Archive.org as well. It explains calculus in a very easy to understand way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome.

Past papers and TSOKOS help, but as I mentioned, IB is tricky with their papers. The difficulty of the questions do not match that of the syllabus. While the syllabus provides enough information for you to answer the questions, the amount of work you'd need to do is insane. That's why I recommend going above the syllabus in the sciences. 

IB is equivalent to a first year university course, so I'd recommend textbooks for freshmen. I would say that the Feynman lectures are the best for this sort of thing, if you don't mind the little calculus. Either way the calculus doesn't play much of a role early in the book, and it's still good to learn it to improve physics, maths and chemistry. 

The Feynman lectures captures exactly the kind of thinking that's useful for IB papers. Studying them can be a bit tough at times, but the payoff is worth it. I can guarantee 7 for every assignment in physics, and with just the chemistry IB syllabus and this book, at least a 6 for each chemistry assignment, which can turn into a 7 with a freshman chemistry textbook. 

I'll try and give an example of what I mean: the gravitational field and its potential. A lot of students seem to have difficulty with the concepts, and that's because of the way the material is presented. There's no focus on the fundamental relationship between fields and potentials, just an equation, which is just as incomprehensible without the proper background. 

A field represents the force that a mass would exert, in a sense. A field is actually representative of how a potential changes. In fact the relationship between the two is exactly that of force and potential energy, because of what fields and potentials represent. A potential is therefore a sort of measure of energy, and a field shows the direction in which potential is decreasing. 

Let's try the concept: say you have a planet and a rocket leaving from the planet. You are given data about how the potential of that rocket changes with distance from that planet and the mass of the rocket. They ask for the gravitational force x meters away from the planet; a classic question. Because you know that the field is the rate of change of the potential in space, you know that if you find the change in potential you find the force. 
A change in potential is easy to calculate: the difference in the potentials of the rocket, as seen on the graph. Since field = change in potential per unit distance (change in space), you can calculate the field. From there you can get the force = field times mass. 

It's useful to know a bit more than the syllabus to reveal hidden links. The IB syllabus simplifies things too much to make solving their questions easy. Practising past papers is useful too of course, but the point is to use this practise as a test of understanding, not a way of understanding itself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've in a leakier boat. I've my November exams coming up, my mocks in 3 months or so, the entirety of CAS, an incomplete EE, un-started TOK presentations and essay, a next to final physics II, and un-started chemistry, psychology and maths IIs. My French IOC is coming up in a few months as well, and I've got few more exams on the side, for a few months too. I haven't revised a thing since I started IB. I'm currently waiting for my April hols to start.

Based on performance so far, I would say that yes, it is possible to get a 42. Just use hols a lot and study leave. Good luck by the way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you don't mind some calculus, the Feynman lectures are absolutely brilliant for physics. It goes a bit over the syllabus but to get good grades for physics, that's required anyway. Went from C (used them for GCSEs) to A* in 3 months. Also, I obtained 7 on all my physics assignments for IB, except one (I HATE measurements, ok? Either way 6 is not too bad either) thanks to the lectures. 
Actually anything from Feynman in general is great to understand physics and the nature of science.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm taking all the three HL. 

For physics and chemistry, the best way I found is to learn extra. Go beyond the syllabus; the IB exams are uni-level, but the syllabus doesn't teach you the tricks to answer these questions. Corners are cut to make the syllabus "simpler" but it has the opposite effect instead. While you have enough information in the syllabus to answer the questions, the way the information is presented hides many links that would be useful to you.

 Going beyond the syllabus gives you the ability to see those links, and if these links are taught well, you should be able to see the essence of the sciences. Seeing the essence makes working a lot easier, as you can base yourself on your own experience, knowledge and expectations -something known as physical intuition. After all, science describes the world we live in, so you should be able to use what you know from experience. When you go in advanced material, things are made a lot more explicit, a lot clearer; the thought process is demonstrated clearly so you can learn how to use your physical intuition. 

Also, chemistry is more or less physics reformulated in a more complicated way that deals more with specifics rather than generalities. Therefore the underlying thought processes are easily found from physics. That is, one can better understand chemistry by learning physics. Some basic QM and EM, and a more in-depth Thermodynamics won't hurt. You'd also need to memorise some names and reactions because of the less general nature of chemistry. 

To explain how to learn maths is quite more difficult than explaining how to learn science. In general, the maths syllabus is pretty well contained, because IB obviously put quite the emphasis on its rigour. Therefore, it is not really necessary to learn beyond the syllabus to understand. The premises are also easy enough to follow. In my opinion most of the difficulty comes in finding ways to solve problems. 

First, algebraic skills must be top-notch. Equation manipulating should become second nature; logs, powers, trig, fractions ... all of that should be automatic. The best way to achieve this is to learn and understand the rules and logic behind them, and thus form algorithms to plow your way through. That way, if ever there is a difficult instance of problems, you can simply apply your algorithms and get an answer either way. In problems where lateral thinking is required, understanding the logic and rules helps establish an algorithm to follow. This is not only advice for equation manipulating; it applies in general for any topic of maths. 

One should also be aware of certain identities, because they save time. It's like playing the piano. Sure you could, each time get your sheet music and read the notes one by one and play. It gives a tune, but is also horrendously slow. It's much better to get the sheet music, read it a few times, practise, and eventually learn to play the tune from memory.  In the same way, learning identities (quadratic formula, binomial expansion, trig stuff and permutations and combinations are recommended) allows you to solve problems much quicker. Being aware of identities also shows a pathway to a solution much quicker because then you could have extra information about a given problem, or be able to reduce the problem to a stage where identities become useful. 

Because maths can retain its essence even in this diluted form, solving problems is as much of an art as a science. The art resides in turning the problem into a stage where you can apply the science. I can't emphasise how important understanding the concepts is. When you do, you can actually reason and open up a multitude of pathways to make a problem solvable using standard methods. Maths HL is particularly fond of giving problems where there is no way to make standard methods work at first glance. One must learn the skill of shaping problems into a form where you can plug and chug away. This skill comes with reasoning about concepts, and practice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never heard of it, but it looks like a very interesting book. Thanks for the recommendation.

Something which has been around for a very long time becomes mundane for the average person (not having a specific interest in it). For something to be around for so long, it must be tremendously useful, and thus must have a rich history of experimenting, its own development, and the development of the world around it.  </TEXT>
