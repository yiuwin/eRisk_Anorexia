	<TEXT> ~$350 is the cheapest I've seen the MSI RX 480 8GB until now. Getting a $70-80 with it seems like a pretty good deal rather than being overpriced.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've spent hours upon hours trying to find a mod for it. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything out yet (or wasn't when I checked a couple months back).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why Do you Love Berserk? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> If this has been posted before then I'd love to see that discussion. I'm fairly new here and haven't seen one recently and am interested to hear your guys' reasons. 

Somewhat simple topic: what are *your* reasons for liking Berserk? I'm sure we all agree that the story's amazing, the artwork is perfect (for the most part), and the characters are some of, if not *the* best, from any manga. But is there anything about Berserk which you find makes it better than anything else?

Personally, Guts' entire struggle, Griffith's ambition, and Casca's... potato-ness, are just innately satisfying. There's something amazing and unforgettable about the shit Guts has to go through. The simple idea that everyone's just one bad day, one bad decision, away from snapping is done so damn well through Griffith that he is--as much as I absolutely despise him--one of the most well done characters I've had the pleasure of reading about. 

I could go into way too much detail about why I love Berserk but that wouldn't be very fun. I'm interested in hearing how a series going on for decades, especially one which has nearly been at a halt for the past 10 years, has such a dedicated and active fanbase. Why do you guys keep coming back to this series?

	<TEXT> Yeah, I don't plan to go over 1080p anytime soon. Thanks! I'll see if I can find enough money to get this sometime today. ^^  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First time building a PC and I decided to go with the MSI GAMING X GTX 1060 (3GB) model over the RX480. But this is not ~$50 cheaper.
Would this be a better buy at this price?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's absolutely awesome, thanks! Are you making more artworks for Berserk other than just these designs? Because I'd love to follow along with your work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that's fair. I'm a working college student so I can sympathize with that pretty well haha. Are these going to be available only for a limited time or would I be able to buy some in a few months as well (like February/March)?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you have other artwork for Berserk as well? 65 is expensive so I wouldn't mind waiting to see if you've got other pieces. If not, I'll try saving up. ^^
