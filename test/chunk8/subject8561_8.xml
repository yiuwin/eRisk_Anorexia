	<TEXT> There is normally a where clause.  I left it out because it is inconsequential.  With or without, it still takes a long time. 

I should also say, performing a similar update on another 60MM + table in my db takes less than 1 sec. 

It's something about this table specifically.

Normally, I would not have a top 10 and expect millions of records to update in under 10 min (as it does with other tables).   </TEXT>
