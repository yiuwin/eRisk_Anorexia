	<TEXT> I've read a quote by Dorothy Parker somewhere ,it says "The cure for boredom is curiosity ".I think you should cultivate a habit of being curious ,to explore new hobbies and new avenues in life.You could start learning a new language,you can take online computer coding classes or you can learn a new skill like painting or pottery .
Gardening is another good use of spare time .Volunteering is a good idea,you can even start online free classes for deserving students or volunteer in a hospital or nursing home .
The options are many ,but you need to instill an adventurous spirit to explore them . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As the picture is cropped so I can't see the shape of your fingers which tells a lot about the personality of an individual.From whatever I can see,my reading is that you are a very private person and like to keep your cards close to your chest.At this point in life,you are undergoing some kind of conflict resulting in anxiety and stress.You are very sensitive ( though you never express your feelings ) in nature.You are quite intelligent but a little inconsistent.You have faced some conflicts in your early childhood and you are still facing some obstacles,but you are blessed with a good luck to counter them.
In the matter of heart,there have been some disappointments and short term relationships (If I may say so,you are wary of deep attachments).You'll travel a lot in future and it will bring you success.In your late teens,you faced some great problem that you effectively handled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would just like to add a quote here : "O my darling bookshow dear to me are they all! For have I not chosen them one by one, gathered them in with the sweat of my brow? I do love you all! It seems as if, by long and sweet companionship, you had become part of myself." 
It's by a famous French Orientalist Antoine Isaac.So ,this feeling is not strange for a staunch bibliophile! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are a kind hearted ,sincere and honest person who likes to analyse things and is cautious in nature .However,you also like to explore new options ,travel and play some kind of sport .
You are bit stubborn and perhaps show inflexibility on some occasions.
You are also hardworking and possess good physical stamina,with a sharp incisive mind .However,some early life incident has made a deep mark on you ( making you a bit indecisive and unsettled).I can't see for sure ,but I think you are moody and sometimes subject to emotional volatility.However ,you are blessed with enough willpower to overcome that .You are also prone to anxiety.
You are gifted with a good intuition and you are generally able to make good assessments of other people .

	<TEXT> Excellent synopsis of the ills of the celebrity medical treatment ( and it isn't confined to one country ,rather it's a universal phenomenon).I think that this excessive  use of analgesics and sedatives ( instead of focusing on the core problems,for which their clients have neither time nor patience) has led to a spike in premature celebrity deaths .Another aspect of this treatment is the increase in unnecessary cosmetic procedures ( which in my humble view is actually a temporary escape  for the deeply depressed souls ,but doctors either fail to recognise this or purposefully ignore it )
I think celebrities are one of the most vulnerable souls .Awash with money, they are often isolated from general population and under immense stress due to the high expectations associated with them .Therefore they prove to be an ideal  prey for someone with an eye for easy money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for such a detailed reply,You are quite right about him being a psychopath.He likes to tease and demean people,and tries to play with their feeling like a cat playing with a vulnerable mouse.However the probability he's suffering from psychological ailment would help me not to take his comments personal.The intent of his mean comments is as you have rightly stated is to purposefully lower down my morale and to try to impose him on myself .Thanks again for your worthy advice . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well ,I could provide you with some details ,and then you would be in a better position to judge the situation: He has repeatedly said to me ( and to his colleagues ) that he's the only irreplaceable person in the department ,others are just appendages ( which in my view is a sign of narcissism of highest degree !) .He gets all the presentations made by his other colleagues and me ,but to the head of the department ,he presents them as his own work .He usually makes derogatory remarks about women ,and repeatedly tells me that he doesn't like ambitious or high achieving women .When I get appreciation from the higher authorities ,he comments that  I don't deserve it and tries to remove me from that very project besides being extremely rude and capricious ! </TEXT>
