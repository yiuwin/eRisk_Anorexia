	<TEXT> I'd have to say Rae Sloane and Denetrius Vidian.

Vidian's Thrawnishness and not being your typical Imperial really bumped him to the top of my favorites list. He was very much about outside the box thinking and was more than willing to play a long game to get his desired result (see: the whole frigging Imperial plotline of *A New Dawn*)

And Rae because she isn't your run-of-the-mill motto-spouting Imperial, but is still 100% loyal to the Empire.

She's very independent-minded, especially in the *Aftermath* books, and she's got her own agenda and own beliefs about the Empire and is willing to do what it takes to make sure that it comes to fruition, especially in the post-Endor Empire.

Plus, she's become a recurring villain (*A New Dawn* (her first appearance), an issue of *Kanan*, and the *Aftermath* trilogy), which is always fun to see. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-07-26 06:38:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since December, I've been trying to figure out just how the hell you access the #2 hold and the freight loading area from the interior of the Falcon.

The #2 hold has the life support and shield generator systems, kind of important systems that, if something happens mid-flight or in combat, if you can't access them, you're screwed.

I can find no door, nor anywhere obviously a hidden door.

Directly starboard of the dejarik table is a structural wall with conduits, directly foreward is a bed, then port and aftward is the passenger section.

Unless the side of the bed nook opens or there is a secret panel in the cockpit access tunnel, I can find nothing.

Am I totally missing seeing a door/hatch? Or is it that there is no (marked) access to #2 hold from the interior of the Falcon? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. The December date is firm.

Because, even though they are doing a lot of practical effects, there are some they have to do via CGI, and that takes time.

Also, during editing and such, they'll find what bits they have to ADR or just outright reshoot. Also, if they add a few pages because they like how an actor/actress played their minor character and they want to give them a few more lines or a bit more to do or something, or if during shooting/editing they realized that a certain scene didn't play out well, or if an extra stole the shot during a scene focused Rey and Luke or something and need to redo it, that's when they'd fix that, is during reshoots, which will probably be in a few months.

Also, they may do additional shooting for characters, like if Benicio del Toro or Laura Dern have smaller (like Max von Sydow-sized) parts and their schedule didn't work for filming during principal, then they'd shoot their scenes during reshoots. 

Like for Star Trek: Beyond, Shohreh Aghdashloo, a rather recognizable actress, didn't shoot her scenes until reshoots because her character, the commander of a starbase, wasn't added until reshoots/she wasn't available during principal.

Plus, it's more time for working any reference books (Cross-Sections, Visual Dictionary) and tie-in material that they want released on December 15. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno.

The MPAA tends to be more lenient with fantasy violence. Like that's why, as violent as it got, what with the decapitation of Tuskens and the Battle of Geonosis, even Episode II was only PG.

If it wasn't for the scene of Anakin burning, Ep III might've been PG as well.

So, even if there's a wholesale army-on-army slaughter, as long as it's with lightsabers and bladders, it is possible that it might only be PG-13. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's become more-or-less canon.

With the release of The Animated Series DVD, the studio appears to have changed its stance, and is leaning towards the animated series being part of established Star Trek canon. Previously, The Animated Series was not considered part of established Star Trek canon by Paramount Pictures. References from the series have gradually become more accepted in other Star Trek series, most notably on Deep Space Nine and Enterprise (see the "questionable canon" section below for the complete list of references)
The series, which lasted two years, could be viewed as the completion of the Enterprise's five-year mission. D.C. Fontana personally views all 22 episodes as year four. StarTrek.com considers the seasons collectively to represent the fifth and final year of the mission.


One of the big things that came from TAS originally was "Tiberius" being Kirk's middle name. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Finished a DS9 marathon a month or so ago, and I found this to be the case.

A lot of the themes of DS9 are still relevant today.

Plus, instead of the TOS   TNG trend of always teaming up the same two or three characters (Riker   Troi, Data   LaForge, Picard   Crusher), DS9 mixes it up. Like on TNG, it'd only ever be Odo   Kira (romantic interests) in a shuttle together, but one the series best episodes is Quark   Odo in a shuttle together.

The fact that DS9 really explored the full breadth of everyone's relationships to each other is part of what makes it so great.

Also, the Dominion War seasons are also very relatable to today. (esp. "In the Pale Moonlight", "Siege of AR-558" and "It's Only a Paper Moon")

But you really need to watch DS9.

Also, currently in a Voyager marathon, midway through season 5.

S1 is more hit-than-miss, S2 is more miss-than-hit, S3-5 are pretty consistently good.

ENT has some good eps in S1-2, and bad eps. S3, I think, really picks up and S4, after Manny Coto took over show running, albeit it was too little too late, but S4 of ENT is almost universally considered phenomenal. (Plus, ENT explains the Klingon foreheads)

So, definitely watch DS9, VOY and ENT.

And I also highly recommend the Animated Series. It's so damn good. More than makes up for the mediocre S3 of TOS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Journey to The Force Awakens was predominantly an immediate after effects, as well as set up (such as meeting Poe Dameron's parents).

Without spoiling *too* much, Bloodline introduces the start of the Resistance, hints to the First Order and why they thought the New Republic was broken, etc.

Also, probably even more importantly, Rian Johnson, the director of Episode VIII, contributed ideas to the novel, which heavily implies concepts and/or characters in Bloodline will appear in E8 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except that, since the main networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CW) 100% rely on ad revenue to operate, they need the longer 22-24 ep seasons to make money.

Cable (USA, TNT) and premium (HBO) can get away with short seasons, in part, because they make money from ad revenue, as well as from subscription fees from cable providers.

That being said, the pay and budget of network shows is much higher than that of cable and premium. And, even within the networks, some have enough revenue to allow for larger budgets than others (e.g. CBS has more revenue than CW).

tl;dr: American television is 99.9% privatized, so they need ads to make money. More eps = more ads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate to burst your bubble (it really is a neat theory), but

 During the early Pendulum Wars, almost a century before the Lambent Pandemic, the COG established the New Hope Research Facility to study the possible toxicity of Imulsion. Because of the discoveries made there, the facility was shut down and the scientists as well as a large number of test subjects were forced to relocate to Mount Kadar. Myrrah is a descendant of these scientists and, unlike the New Hope subjects, is completely human.

It was confirmed by Cliff.

The "test subjects" were the Sires and their children, the first Locust Drones, who were mutated by Imulsion on a genetic level from birth.

James Spader pretty much had to carry the episode, and he did it with the strength of Atlas. It was an absolutely phenomenal episode and a fantastic and emotional performance from James. 

Without saying too much, it told us why Red is so attached to Liz and he acted the crap out of the episode. Not in a scenery-chewing way, but in a way that really played with your heart.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **WARNING**: By nature, since the trailers are meant to sell the show to advertisers, spoilers are within, but nothing outside of what is revealed in the pilot.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My top pick is [Son of Zorn (Fox, Sun 8:30/7:30 Cent)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkPnlQTi8heM).

The other four, in no particular order:

* [Timeless (NBC, Mon 10/9)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4glJzvUunOE)

* [Time After Time (ABC, midseason)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN4C4Ar5BLo)

* [Making History (Fox, midseason)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-TVyOqCkr0)

* [Designated Survivor (ABC, Wed 9/8)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_f1v0Nx5Sw)

Honorable Mention goes to [Speechless (ABC, Wed, 8:30/7:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u55WK6AbaM), [Lethal Weapon (Fox, Wed 8/7)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXZdEmvcFdU) and [Frequency (CW, Wed 9/8)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL8Rl2n2C6Y)


And:

* Best Overall Slate of New Shows: Fox and ABC (close enough to be a tie, but Fox wins overall because of Son of Zorn)
* Worst Overall Slate of New Shows: CBS by a landslide </TEXT>

It seems like most new model cars offer plenty of legroom, but are reduced on headroom. Like in most new cars, my head hits the roof, or clears it by less than inch. Why do new cars, even crossover SUVs (e.g. Honda Pilot), have increasingly less headroom?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It may have been part of a sketch show, or from CollegeHumor or Funny Or Die, but it might also have been independent.

It was, if I remember correctly, a white guy recording an album with lyrics all but saying that he was gay, all the while telling the producer that he was straight. As the video went on, the lyrics got more and more explicitly about him and doing things with guys. The lyrics often also contradicted what he told the producer, like if he told the producer he doesn't suck off guys, the next lyrics were about him sucking off a guy.

Please help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. It's that barrier to entry that I've struggled with for the last 9 years. On a good day in Halo 5, I do something like 3-9.

I do that on a bad day in CoD.

Plus, leveling up in Halo doesn't really get you anything. In CoD   BF, you're rewarded for leveling up.

Oh, [also](http://imgur.com/9IHrQ6V).

	<TEXT> I decided to do some Halo MP (Warzone, mainly) after not having played it in months.

I quickly remembered why I never play Halo MP, dating back to Halo 3 (minus Halo Wars, 'cause that was the shit).

I can see and acknowledge the entertainment value there, but I just can't get into it. (Think potential energy and kinetic energy. The ball is sitting there, at the top of the hill, waiting to roll, but nothing ever gives it that push.)

My go-to for most any shooter is Team Deathmatch (or equivalent), and even there I can't get into Halo MP. I also love Warzone, or, rather, want to love it so badly, but can't.

Halo seems to be very black-and-white: you suck or you kick ass; while CoD and BF are more of a spectrum, you can suck or kick ass, or can do "okay".

Why is there such a disconnect between CoD/BF multiplayer and Halo multiplayer? I'd especially like to hear from you cross-franchisers. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems like every car is getting smaller and smaller.

The new Honda Fits, for example. In my 2013 Fit, it gives 39-40" of headroom, leaving me plenty of clearance, but in the 2016, with a sunroof, the top of my head sticks out, which means without one, my head would touch the roof.

It seems like cars are increasingly made for 5'6" tall people and under.

Even my mom, at 5'8", has trouble fitting into a lot of new cars.

Why is it that so few reasonably-sized cars and crossover SUVs provide 40" of headroom anymore?

It seems like when it comes time for me to buy a new car in several years, I'll have to get a 2019 Suburban or 2019 Excursion or something else fuel-inefficient and absurdly oversized. </TEXT>

Like when starting Simpson Tapped Out, it'll go to the initial load screen for a half second, and then crash.

	<TEXT> who is the arch-nemesis of her father-in-law, as well as the arch-nemesis her grandfather-in-law.

And the father figure to Emma's baby daddy is the son to the Crocodile and the son of his ex-girlfriend, who is Rumple's ex-wife.


Next season's story arc? They all visit the town psychiatrist.

EDIT: I know Emma and Neal were never married, but their two families are, in essence, in-laws.  Like if two people have been dating for 20 years and never married, their families are not technically in-laws, but they are as good as. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently finished marathoning it.

Used to think TNG was the best. Now, I'm of the opinion that DS9 is the best for a multitude of reasons, but on is because they mixed-and-matched characters for episodes (like O'Brien and Kira, for example), whereas TNG always paired off the same characters predictably (Riker-Troi, LaForge-Data...).

Also, Dukat. I loved the hell out of him. He was such a fantastic villain. </TEXT>
