	<TEXT> First time posting after a while of browsing. Finally came across someone that really loved his thesaurus.

I know text in post like this can be annoying so I typed it up and will put it here for easier reading:

"Dear neighbors,

Please be advised that if you werent the individuals who had the party at 1 AM, this does not apply to you. I have made two copies of this letter because I am unfamiliar with the layout for the townhouse system (i.e. which house corresponds to which floor) and consequently cannot precisely determine which one was the source of noise.
If you are the individuals responsible for the raucous bacchanalia of this past night that demonstrated such a lack of consideration for others, then this explicitly applies to you. Firstly, I hope you take note of the magnanimity I have observed in this incident, as I did not contact an RA or any other authority, and did not even come directly to you. Should this repeat again, I will not hesitate to contact an RA, and, if necessary, the police. Be aware that if alcohol was present (which I do not discount as a possibility) you are risking being kicked out of the univeristy and being charged with breaking the law, and if it so happens that you are caught with it because of such a complaint, I assure you I will not feel any remorse for issuing it. People have classes early in the morning and our regular assignments do enough in debilitating our circadian rhythms. I ask you to show a modicum of consideration and limit your partying to times when there arent classes still in session the subsequent day, or at hours that would not disrupt you neighbors sleep, or even both (yes, shockingly, those are, in fact, options).

Have a nice day."
