	<TEXT> The ideas I have are micro payment /freemium model. $1 per album for extended features, after say 10, you would get unlimited use for year. Also I could add a sponsored frame as the last frame and have ad revenue and brand sponsored albums. Thanks for the suggestions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The site is live. http://mfile.io anonymous uploads isn't exactly a feature. I think what I am doing is a tool that provides fast easy, yet polished portfolios. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are trillions of images shared per year, so there should be enough of a market for IMGUR and other players, also IMGUR focuses on a social media channel and memes. Squarespace doesn't have the fast ease of use or anonymous uploads. I am looking towards the space between IMGUR and Squarespace I believe.  </TEXT>
