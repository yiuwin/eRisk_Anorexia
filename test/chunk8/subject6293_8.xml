	<TEXT> WTB: Christmas moss and Staurogyne Repens. 

I'm also looking for places around KC to buy plants. Any suggestions? 

If I can't find anything here I'd like to know if these are good deals:
[Christmas moss](http://www.aquabid.com/cgi-bin/auction/auction.cgi?liveplantsm 1388302361)

For S.Repens I'm having trouble deciding between [this](http://www.aquabid.com/cgi-bin/auction/auction.cgi?liveplantsr 1388013005) and [this](http://www.aquabid.com/cgi-bin/auction/auction.cgi?liveplantsr 1387912678).

If you can find better deals without sacrificing quality please let me know. I'd really appreciate it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just received my OTG Y-cable and I'm excited to try it out.

The only problem is that I'm having trouble finding a 4.4 rom with OTG support, so if you know of any roms please share. [I found a flashable .zip](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2181820) that enables OTG for 4.4, but it's "Most likely INCOMPATABLE with CM11", so if there aren't any roms with OTG support I'll have to settle with one that isn't based off of CM.

 ~~I'll also take any suggestions for custom recoveries.~~ </TEXT>
