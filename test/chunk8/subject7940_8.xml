An year ago I was interested in places where the radio plays once Social Club associates songs with Spotify.

I had posted it, but now it is deleted. </TEXT>

I agree with you.

 In addition to that I've often been curious about the cameras, the monkey mosaics are a good way of showing us that we can trigger something by snapping a photo of it.

Not only that, but Cletus' and Beverly's missions too, but: what are the things sensible to photography? </TEXT>

Me neither,

 That Lamar is the first SP character you get introduced to in Online and his "eggs" dialogue also interested me for a while. There's some understandable reason, when listening to his dialogue that makes him an interesting character with a possible purpose more than comedic sidekick.

After he dropped dead while I was playing *Lamar Down*, I really started to pay more attention to him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  However... Because I rushed to reach 100% to see the UFO's and basicly went on searching for more EE related stuff I never took a look at this Jill von Crastenburg... I guess I'm not filled in like you guys so does anyone have like a sub on her so I can catch up?

Actually, you seem to be doing very it well; really, it is really hard to spot possibilities like the ones you did right now with all the information available about even the minor details of this game.

I also had not heard about her before, but, as soon as I read her entry, it mentioned her Bleeter account, so, I guess it can be helpful somehow; thinking about it with some liberty makes me to think about her profile being there just to show her face (once the text seems to be from someone who looks like her).

 I still think if we all put our heads together like were doing right now we can just finish this s.o.b. Easter Egg and get the Jet pack! Or not...

I agree with you and I am glad to be able to give some kind of support to your investigation! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Captain Cook asked a native what was the name of the islands, the native responded and Cook wrote down in his log, "Owhyee". You can look it up and see it in his own handwriting.
 Right after that, Cook named the islands "The Sandwich Isles" after his good friend, the Earl of Sandwich (yes, the same one that invented the sandwich).

I know this story and I understand all the issue, but I could not avoid to make a direct reference to the entitlement present in the artwork itself, what must have some reason behind (and not a malevolent one), I hope you understand me; for instance, I read it as a joke about the behavior of Captain Cook himself, as the artist *supposedly* took the same liberty as he somehow *reached* the islands as it was the way he signed his work.

 Just another example of British Imperial arrogance.

I feel it was something common during imperial/colonial era: I live in a country named after an extinct wood (explored by the same people who named it) and in a city named after an emperor who governed from another continent (and it was an entire farm owned by a priest).

 What is the point of this chart when you can get a satellite photograh?

I guess you are being too radical about it and this behavior underates the value of art, what is a human work after all, done by a real person (not me, just to be clear); by the way, if you are able to compare the painting with the map, I can say the painter did a good job, then; also, questions like that could be made about many aspects of our lives and answers could not even be enough because it is just words after all.

Anyway, I am really sorry for the title: I did not mean to disrespect hawaiian culture; actually, I just thought hawaiians would like to view Hawaii once again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Personally I think, the figure on the mural to be a hiker is more likely than a jet pack stick figure. It could've something to do with the altruist victims/hikers.

Yes, I can see it.

For instance, the hikers could be addressed to the UFOs instead of to the altruists and you can imagine how difficult it would be to deliver them in the right time with the required weather condition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The weirdest thing in this mission is that it seems Lamar can be killed.

When I played it, just before reaching the end, Lamar dropped dead and the mission did not stop as I could wander while the other characters were already waiting.

I was able to continue if I would like, but I preferred to explode a bomb nearby to restart as it was my first playthrough back then.

Maybe if I had finished the mission, he would just stand up as nothing had happened, but I do not know and it is weird because nobody seems to have experienced such situation. </TEXT>

Sorry, unfortunately, I do not have control over that; I could not access the page where it was, only the media, so, it may be a detailed explanation about this project, I am not sure.

I think it is fast paced to highlight the concept of "breathing earth" it explores, but maybe a screen recording could be helpful in order to achieve it anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Original source](http://sysrep.aalto.fi/demo2015/mexico.html):

 **Map of Mexico 1550, a digital facsimile**

 The project is based on the famous Santa Cruz Map dating back to the early 16th century. The original is in the Uppsala University Library in Uppsala, Sweden.

 Lily Daz  Project director and producer

 Jyrki Messo  Software developer

 Lisha Dai  User interface design.

 Systems of Representation research group

 Department of Media, Aalto University
 
 sysrep.aalto.fi/mexico

 The research entailed the creation of a digital replica from a valued original that is kept at the library of the University of Uppsala library in Uppsala, Sweden. The replica was created as collaborative work between Media Lab Helsinki and the Institute of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing at Aalto University and the Uppsala University Library in Sweden. (aalto.fi)

 The project developed from research done by Lily Daz-Kommonen as a Fulbright scholar during the years 1990-91 at the Archive of the Indies in Seville, Spain. During this time, Daz-Kommonen studied the visualization techniques used by Spanish cosmographers in the 16th century. The work has been further developed by the Systems of Representation research group. (sysrep.aalto.fi)

 The project has served as a platform from which to develop and contextualize research and educational activities, as well as IT development in the area of Digital Cultural Heritage. Current R D activities include further refinement of the design specifications. These developments have led to the creation of Image Annotation Notebook (Imanote II) tool, an advanced information processing tool based on IIPimage viewer. </TEXT>

I am not sure how they did it, however, in this case, it seems [Alonso de Santa Cruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_de_Santa_Cruz), a cartographer/mapmaker who worked for [Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), was apt to take this task at the time. </TEXT>

Yes, I am aware about that; but the warp glitch pointed recently adds some power to the director mode itself and that is the reason I am interested in what you can find doing that there.

About the skull, I only associate it with Trevor because of his truck and I never could imagine a better meaning for that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The only normal reason i can think of for doing this and its just a guess, maybe because if you are making a scene and you want a gas trail, you may need time and dont want it to vanish before you are ready?

It makes sense for sure, but why would that create the obstacles you experienced?

  I wanted to try to get the cave fire to the altar but i havent suceeded yet because of its glitchyness and why it acts wierd here is beyond me.

If you ever perfmorm it perfectly, please, let us know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  HOWEVER, there is a cypher that no one has been able to break so far, which is rather puzzling, considering that the other ciphers were TOO simple. That cipher appears close to the drawing of a wormhole, close to the Ricci flow formula, googolplex indications, and so on.

Interesting info; if you have links or more details about it, I would like to get up to date!

 Also, nobody knows who painted the pictures displayed in the room nor the meaning of the "4 connected circles symbol" that appear on both paintings or the meaning of many of the drawings in the room.

If I am not wrong, something I read/watched implied the painting was made by him himself just like he had learnt it from the sculptor, but I can not be sure; by the way, at the end of the first video, it talks about a friend of him who was there during the entire period, although, he did nor recorded an interview as it seems he only exchanged texts messages with the reporter or something similar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are pretty interesting, indeed.

When I firstly encountered the texture pack provided by u/the_monotonist long time ago, I tried to figure out what they could mean and this was the best interpretation I was able to reach so far.

[Those](http://imgur.com/Kakzv5i) along with [these](http://imgur.com/Koo1wgV) could mean some kind of command string, respectively, the former meaning action commands and the latter the directions.

Just like traditional gamepads, the set of buttons are collored distinctly and the direction controller is fully and only greyish; also, Rockstar would be able to speak universally over different platforms with this hidden command string without needing to tell it in terms of *A* and *B*, just representing their own functions itself.

However, I am not only not sure as well as I also see [this one](http://imgur.com/Koo1wgV) as a possible [Trevor's return](https://youtu.be/zyt0V18Slbo?t=1m25s) reference somehow; by the way, I have just noticed how [Trevor's eyes](https://youtu.be/zyt0V18Slbo?t=3m6s) look messy during a key part of this scene now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  My point or theory I suppose is, how would someone who never played GTA IV and paid attention to the tips in the corner of the screen know to repeatedly press L2 and R2 to hotwire the vehicle faster besides pure random chance?

We can imagine how one-mission-only gadgets and other features like Chop perspective and yoga practice could work.

 Secondly, if an element like this exists in GTA V, and is essentially an unannounced hidden interaction, what else exists that we can do but we just don't know about?

One speculation I have never metioned, not to hide, but because it is too empty, is that [the colored alien glyphs depicted all-around the hippy camp could represent interactive commands as button functions like *to run*, *to crunch*, *to jump* and *to attack*](http://imgur.com/Kakzv5i), for instance. </TEXT>
