	<TEXT> this hits very close to home. I'm so, so sorry you've gone through this. my heart breaks for you. you deserve so, so much better. I understand being unable to cry. I actually asked my therapist about it a month or so ago. she said that sometimes your brain doesn't want to deal with something, even if you want to. it's a protective mechanism. your brain is keeping the stuff that hurts locked away in a box for when you are in a safe enough place to deal with it. as another user said, it's also an unconcious coping mechanism for dealing with shock and trauma. It's frustrating - sometimes it feels like things would feel a little better if you could cry! 

I hope you soon come to a place where your brain feels safe enough to be vulnerable. I hope you find peace within yourself and in your life. I hope you and your daughter grows up looking up to her amazing mother. I hope you heal. hugs if you want them. keep your chin up. we're rooting for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> over the weekend, I had a sore throat that got progressively worse. yesterday, I saw my therapist who sent me to to doctor. I told Nmom I was going and she told me it was just a sore throat and to stop being so dramatic. I went anyways (hurray for being 18). I have bronchitis. my throat is really swollen. I had my tonsils removed ten years ago and my doctor thought i still had them because of the swelling. he also said there seemed to be fluid in my lungs (bronchial tubes) and if I wasn't significantly better, to come back in on Thursday. today, my chest has started to ache. I have a wet cough, but nothing comes up. it hurts to cough. Nmom told me to "ignore the pain, stop being a baby". we were walking into a store and I had a coughing fit and started to get dizzy in the road. Nmom starts yelling at me to stop coughing and starts yelling at me that I am being dramatic. 

I'm home. I took some ibuprofen and am drinking a powerade. I think I'm calling my doctor tomorrow. I feel really sick. </TEXT>
