The town that I live in has a military base, and a lot of the kids that come here have lived in Germany in the past, so naturally they just pick up liking Bayern, so there is a decent amount of Bayern fans in my school, and I felt like Dortmund didn't get as much love. Also Christian Pulisic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Companies should be free to manufacture their products wherever they wish and with this they are punished because they want to put their plant in Mexico. It's an obstruction of capitalism in my opinion as well, and capitalism is something a lot of Trump supporters and Trump himself find pride in. 

To extend it even further, Trump wants to stop illegal immigration. Many immigrants who come illegally come because they want to find jobs. Taking jobs away from Mexico will not make Mexicans stay in Mexico, more will come to America in search of jobs.

Second half looked much better, just don't understand why we took 45 minutes to get going. We also need to get better against the press. It's so easy for teams to score on us through the press. So overall that performance was alarming, but all that matters is that we won. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a long shot in my eyes at this point, but he should work to instill that winning mentality into other players at the club instead of jumping ship. Coq has it, Mesut kinda has it, but I want them all to have it. That's what has separated us from the title for this long. That mentality to never give up was shown today, which is a step in the right direction, but we need to continue to win and show that we are a mentally strong club. Then he will want to stay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We were able to rescue a point from this, so it's going to be turned into a success story of fighting even when the odds are stacked against us.

However, this game was terrible. We defended poorly and made horrible mistakes. Bellerin was god awful, Xhaka was not good either. Alexis did manage to score, but even he was not making the best decisions. Giroud, Ox, and Perez I thought played quite well however. Glad we were able to rescue the point, and this does show a lot about our mentality, however if we weren't so poor to start then this wouldn't have happened. Inexcusable to concede three to a side like Bournemouth.  </TEXT>

Also, you can't place all the blame on Kirk for losing against good teams. There were several occasions this season where he played well and we didn't win (Detroit, Cincinnati, Arizona, @Dallas, two of these teams fall into that win category). If we bolster our defense, then I think next year he'll have more success.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Levi's is definitely the best bet, however Old Navy/Gap has some decent ones. Bought one online on Black Friday, for $30, and with all the deals and promotions they offer you could definitely get one for $50 if you don't want to spend $70-$90 on a Levi's one. Levi's is probably the apex of denim jackets however.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want Detroit. We can beat them. I think Seattle will be tough especially in Seattle, the Falcons have a pretty potent offense, and Green Bay had caught fire. I think we have a legitimate shot against any of these teams but Detroit is a very beatable team.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really interesting to see what happened. Matt Jones was drawing Marshawn Lynch comparisons coming out of college for his size and strength. Now he sits the bench as an undrafted rookie who is much more similar to Lynch is tearing it up. I feel bad for the guy, but it's survival or the fittest in the NFL, and Fat Rob is most certainly the fittest of the two. I hope we pound the rock with him for years to come. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's no way the NFL would allow that first of all, as this would be horrible for the league's TV ratings and reputation, and second of all these two teams are division rivals playing for the NFC North championship. They aren't gonna both just roll over like that. It's win and we're in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the teams that play like this, I think Giroud should start. A lot of the lower-level teams aren't going to go forward a whole lot, and will have most of their players committed to defending. These are the games that are meant for Giroud. When we play a team who is willing to commit men forward against us, then that's when Alexis should start up top. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is very frustrating right now. We're right there, just can't put it in. I think West Brom is going to break down sooner or later though. Iwobi has been brilliant so far, and I think Xhaka has done a good job facilitating. I think we'll get one before halftime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we can become very similar to what the Patriots are. Great passing game, great TE, Great O-line.

Our defense is going to need a lot of work though, and obviously Kirk is no Brady. But we have the basic outline of the Patriots' key to success. I highly doubt by the time Kirk retires he'll have the accolades that Brady does, but I do think he'll win a Super Bowl. 

Not saying we're going to be the new powerhouse of the NFL like the Pats are, but I think we can end up being a similar team to what they have been in the past 5 years. </TEXT>

Edit: just plays later and we recover a fumble, just shows that we have bright spots!!
