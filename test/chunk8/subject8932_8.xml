	<TEXT> Assuming we signed Perez and Mustafi, how would you rate it?

Xhaka - 35m
Mustafi - 30m
Perez - 18m
Holding - 2m
Asano - 1m

That's 89m spent.

I'd say we have very good squad depth in all positions and I'm excited about the new season.

I'd give it a B. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> This game looks awesome, how have I not heard about it!?!? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi, firstly sorry if I am not posting the right type of post, I clicked a "self post" because the alternative was a linked post. 
Secondly, this game looks unreal. I previously enjoyed playing games such as Theme Park (when I was a young kid)
then when I got a bit older I loved, and spent hours playing Tycoon Rollercoaster. Then a few years back I bought SimCity, which was my personal favourite, however a few things did frustrate me with SimCity, such as not being able to build an absolutely huge City.

So a day or 2 ago I decided to see if any new City Builder/Theme Park Building games had recently come out. I read good things about Tropico 3 and even better things about Cities Skyline. I have a couple questions before purchasing the game.

Would you recommend this game?
What would you score it out of 10?
How is it better than SimCity?
What are the best things about Cities Skylines?
What are the worst things about Cities Skylines?

Thanks all! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've made them up/added some new features to what we already have in the world of cod.

Do you like any?

200 points:  Field of Vision.
Instead of the standard UAV, The Field of Vision allows you to see a still silhouette of enemies. As soon as it is activated, you'll see silhouettes from any enemies that are in front of you from where you are, to the end of the map (for example behind walls/crouched down) - You couldn't activate it and then turn to see an enemy behind a wall or in cover if they were to your right for example. Not nearly as powerful as Vision Pulse, but similar.

350 Points - AHR.
Advanced Hovering Robot.
A spherical hovering robot is sent out into the field of battle armed with a machine gun and a tracking light which highlights enemies and makes them show up on the map momentarily. Mild damage weapon/Strong armored.

450 Points - Corruption.
A piece of equipment you can throw and it will detonate upon impact killing enemies within 2 meters of it, and disrupting all electrics and weapons if you are between 2 and 6 meters of initial impact. Enemies will be forced to hide/run as they will be momentarily weaponless.

600 Points - Air Raid.
3 Jet fighters drop multiple bombs one after the other on any area you select.

Nothing fancy here, except pre game whilst in the lobby you can choose if you want to drop either: EMP bombs/FireBombs/Chemical Boms.

EMP Bombs will leave the selected area void of electrical use. An enemy running into this area will have their HUD disabled/grenades disabled, until they leave the area.
Fire Bombs will cause enemies to become burnt and therefore weaker, making them easier to kill if you stumble across one who has entered this area.
Chemical Bombs will cause enemies to become slower and unable to raise/lower their weapon as quickly or accurately as they would normally - screen becomes quite blurry also, remaining in this area causes death.

700 Points - Portal
Once this is earned you'll be able to travel from one part of the map to another in an instant.
Activating this will bring up a large image of the map, you can select two ares where you would like to set up your portal. One in front of your character and one of the opposite side of the map. Once selected, the map disappears. 
Right in front of you there is now a portal, you walk through it and you instantly exit out of the 2nd portal on the far side of the map at the point you selected,- catching your enemies off guard. May sound overpowered, but the portals could take about 3 seconds to get created. If you spot your enemy's portal you can shoot at it and stop it from forming perhaps.

750 Points - Thermobaric Gunship.
This is a very light, agile attack helicopter that is designed to project a long, controllable stream of fire, just like a flame thrower does. Very large range, very quick, very mobile, Mid armor makes it somewhat easier to shoot down. AI navigates around the map incinerating enemies.

800 Points -  MQ-1 Predator.
A UAV that can not be shot down. It reveals enemies, incoming enemy scorestreakes, enemy equipment on the radar for 5 minutes non stop.

900 Points - XM1203 Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon (NLOS Cannon)
A mobile self-propelled armored artillery vehicle. They will fire lock-on missiles into the air onto the map like mortars, targeting enemy players they detect. - Just like Walker Tanks.

1100 Points - Mammoth Tank.
A Super advanced next generation heavy military tank that is deployed via a military transport plane, dropped on the map and you are able to enter it and drive around the map scouting potential enemies. A team mate is able to enter the tank also and fire a machine gun also.
This tank can be used on all terrain and even enter water.
Heavy Armor/Heavy fire rate/Great accuracy, however very slow and not very agile.

1,400 - Laser Star Ship.
Floating Space Ship that you can take full control of. You can sweep across the map effortlessly, and fire an insane laser of death upon anyone within site. The newley updated Chopper Gunner basically however with a futuristic twist. It circles the map as you smash down enemies.

That's all for now, did you like any? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would be a class idea. Just as a game mode yeah sure, would be class.

8 people in a game, all vs all, everyone in their own fighter jets travelling towards the main battlezone at different angles
The timer counts down from 10 - 0, then BOOM... the match starts and everyone is trying to outgun the rest. Would be a cool option. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OH MY GOD. This game looks immense. 1st trailer didn't do it justice.

Chills were had when the jets activated it's thrust and boosted right through the clouds and into space where they had another battle.

This is going to be sick!!! </TEXT>
