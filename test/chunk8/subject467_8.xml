	<TEXT> Spend a couple of hours making some colour palettes. I find a good way to go about this (to start with) is to load some illustrations or websites you like the look of into photoshop and just pick out a few colours and paint them into a new project next to each other. Then when you need some colours for an AE project you can load the photoshop file in and pick them from there! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there a way in premiere (or with a plugin) to display timecodes for multiple tracks, say the source clip and the timeline at the same time next to each other? 

This has always been very easy to do with Avid and super useful for multi-camera setups but all i can seem to do in premiere is have one timecode window that displays the timecode of whatever is highlighted which doesn't seem all that useful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No worries, everything is a learning experience. The more you do the more comfortable and adventurous you become! 

You don't need anything fancy. I use a 8" sabatier for pretty much everything. Probably cost about 20. As long as it's sharp you'll have an easy time of things. Concentrate on getting to know just one knife for everything and you'll then work out where you need something smaller/bigger. I actually keep two of the same knife so I know one is always sharp. Also allows you to cut veggies with the same knife without having just one that you have to wash each time. </TEXT>

Also worth mentioning is the food. Around this area you can get ANYTHING you could possibly want at pretty much any hour, and cheap too. East street market is incredible for your weekly shop. A fraction of the price of tesco and down right authentic!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not a huge issue but I do feel a little self conscious about it. Whenever I have sex I seem to get excessively sweaty to the point where I'm slick with it and often have to towel off, most girls don't se to mind but it's not very nice especially if we cuddle after! 

For perspective I'm 24 and actually pretty physically fit. Cycle a couple of hundred miles a week, mountain biking at the weekends and swim at least twice a week, maybe it's just the added body heat that I'm not so used to when 'working out'! 

Does anyone have any tips for keeping a bit more dry when really going at it? </TEXT>

She turned around (it was my cousin) and everyone else in the line looked at me with my spilled beer all over myself on the floor exclaiming "it was going to be a funny joke!" :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 24 and broke up with my ex of 6 years about 2 months ago, of course, the sex was phenominal. since then I've been getting back in the game a bit and started dating again. It's been a lot of fun but as soon as it comes to getting intimate something in my brain flips and I just lose my erection. It's been fine so far as we've just done tonnes of foreplay and I've been able to pass it off as being tired and things have been cool, I'm not sure that will fly a couple more times though and each time seems to be another nail in my composure. All in all its getting pretty annoying, I absolutely adore doing everything I can to make a lady come but I want to have some fun too! 

This seems to come up fairly regularly and I've given up porn and stopped masturbating a few days before each encounter but it doesn't seem to have helped all that much. 

I would be interested to hear people's experiences with ED pills and whether it's too easy to build a reliance on them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always wanted to get myself on a bike but never had the friends or funds! Having come into a bit of money now might be the time!

What I'm asking is do i need any experience on a bike before i go off and do a CBT (UK) and then a 5 day direct access course after-which I'll plan on buying myself a 250 or 600cc bike.

I've been driving for 6 years and I cycle 100 miles a week around central London so I'm fairly confident on busy roads with two wheels, I'm  into my downhill mountain biking too there's that. That being said I've never actually ridden a bike with an engine so this is new territory for me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me recently and although I'm still a bit cut up about I'm kind of excited to be getting out and start dating for once. I'm 24 and never done dating properly before though! 

Me and the ex were pretty adventurous over time and that has become a huge part of my sexual identity so to speak, I feel every intimate encounter needs to be an experience to remember and I'm a pretty experimental guy day to day. 

I've not had sex with anyone else since the ex so I'm wondering how one goes about judging what a new sexual parter is into without weirding them out or god forbid thinking I'm boring. Fisting and pegging don't really seem like things that come up in conversation that naturally! </TEXT>

However for me it started to decline after the first season, that season had so many great ideas and storylines with twists and intrigue that kept you interested.

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for putting in the time and dedication to build these incredible experiences for people. I don't even want to know the amount of hours I've put into CoH1 multiplayer with my Brother and friends, but it has been some of the best time of my life. 

All I have to ask is why change the UK so much for CoH2? The first one was brilliant for mp and competitive play and by comparison the new one is really clunky. Maybe it's just because I'm used to the old one but there seems to be a lot of wasted space in the new one with lots of confusing textures. I know it's pretty late in the game (so to speak) but even shifting the resource counters to their original position or making it a bit clearer to see which units are red or yellow pinned would be an incredible help to the competitive community!  </TEXT>

We love really good food, going out to nice restaurants etc, We have really different music tastes but both enjoy a good live gig. The real issue is hobbies. I love swimming, cycling, gaming and making things. She is usually so tired from work that all she wants to do on her time off is flop in front of the telly (or if on holiday: sunbathe.)

As far as problems go she really likes to sort things out herself and gains great satisfaction from doing so. This combined with the stubbornness of an ox  makes it really difficult to help her with issues.

This all sounds like i really resent her but in truth i just don't want to lose her because of a mere 2 hours distance.

	<TEXT> It is a good thing not to be completely dependent on your partner for your own happiness - but I'm also a little concerned that you may not feel like you can rely on her for support. Is that an issue for you?

She is extremely hard skinned. A tonne of crap stuff happened to her when she was younger so now she just gets on with life. I respect her for this immensely and it has given her an iron will and irrefutable logic but she now lacks any sympathy whatsoever, basically she's a Vulcan.

Why do you feel empty - because you aren't having your emotional needs met on a regular basis, or because you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel any longer?

Similar to above. We just don't really 'connect' over the phone. Our interests are pretty dissimilar and she works incredibly hard. 

I would love to live with her again and this time have a nice regular working life together but its a conundrum. We're not able to have that now and i wonder if by the time we do get there the spark will be gone.

	<TEXT> Like I said, we have been together almost 6 years. We've stuck it out through me being at university, lived together in two different places, broken up, got back together and the sex is great.

We got back together (after 2 months apart) just over a year ago and we live about 2 hours away from each other in separate cities. With very different schedules we rarely have a full day off together (maybe 10 days a year) and our evenings together are usually around 2 weeks apart.

It's putting the strain on. The problem is we are both extremely individual people and although I pine a little for her it's pretty clear she doesn't "need" me. We don't talk a lot on the phone and if we do its short catch up conversations which I come away from feeling pretty empty.

I love her and she loves me, in the recent past I was pretty certain I was going to propose. we have talked about her moving up to me (london) but it definitely won't be this year. At this point I'm wondering if we would be better off separate so we can go about our lives not have to worry about putting time aside to maintain something just so it can be great in some imaginary future.
