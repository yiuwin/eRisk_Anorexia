	<TEXT> Because it's a moderately sized fleet, and we do have 40 million people. I'm not saying that Texas needs a fleet the exact same size, just that that is the closest sized fleet that i'm aware of to what Texas believes they need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks again. I'll defiantly consider having smaller ships equipped w/rail guns, and i didn't know that helicopters could carry torpedoes. I'll also probably rely on purchasing ships that have already been designed, as making one was way more work than it was worth, and then it gov invalidated in the end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This Battleship is meant to be an unexpected foe to the navy's of today. Ships today typically fight with missiles, and, while there is nothing in error with that, they are far easier to defend against that ballistic projectiles. Therefore, this ship is supposed to present a threat that is both more difficult to combat in general, and because it hasn't been a threat for quite a while. </TEXT>
