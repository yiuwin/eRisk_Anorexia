	<TEXT> I've been to a [10] only once before, not too long ago. I'd gone from smoking every evening/night to not smoking for 2 days. Those 2 days fucked up my tolerance, and the next night I had a 25mg gummy (which usually gets me hardly high). Then I had like about 3/4 a shot of Jameson   then shared a joint of Jack Herer with my friends at a party. I hit the [10] when the joint was almost out and so I told my friends, "Y'all can finish it, I think I'm good." 

I then proceeded to walk around this super crowded and loud house party (with all these cool lights and stuff and a DJ). I have videos of myself, if anyone wants to see). I felt like I had "cotton brain" aka cotton mouth but in your ears but in your brain. Like my mind was cotton. And I couldn't hear as well, so I was either shouting or whispering. My friend goes, "Megan, do we need to go? Like are you okay?" and I said--I remember this verbatim--"Dude, no way. Dude, trust me, I am ay-okay!" And then I did the ok () symbol. In fact this happened more than once. I was so super high that I felt like I was melting into everything and dying but being reborn at the same time. 

I actually quite enjoyed it! It was a wild ride though.


**TL;DR: It was like you have cotton mouth but in your ears but in your mind. Like *you* are a cotton ball/melting into everything and kinda feel like you're dying but being reborn at the same time. It was a WILD ride.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in Calabasas, CA. Part of Los Angeles county. It's in the San Fernando Valley and it's just inland of Malibu. 

- everyone knows or at least knows somebody who knows the Kardashians. (So they have connections)

- everyone is wealthy (living there is pretty expensive. A majority of the houses are at least $1m)

- lots of materialistic valley girls (can confirm)

- lots of people with luxury cars (in high school, my friend got a brand new Range Rover for his 16th birthday as his first car).

- gated neighborhoods galore </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in a dorm suite (2 bedrooms, 1 bath, 1 kitchen, living room) with 3 other girls. First story, one of my roommates who's a sophomore said last year there was an elevator piss bandit. Someone peed in the elevator like 4 seperate times over the course of a semester. No one was ever caught. There were even fliers posted around the Park South buildings apparently.

	<TEXT> Last time I called 9-1-1 was about a month ago. My friends and I were on the balcony of my on-campus apartment smoking weed and we heard a guy yelling. This guy was saying stuff like, "Man, I don't want any trouble," and, "get off me!" and, "Man, PLEASE!" We couldn't see the people, as they must've been around a corner or by another building. The noises stopped and we figured someone walking by must've stopped it, as my building is really close to the campus police station. Nope. Starts up again a few minutes later with the same guy screaming, "DUDE! PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!" It was a Saturday night and there had just been a frat party down the street but I decided to call the cops just to be safe. That guy sounded super scared, like the other person may have had a weapon on them. Also, the guy screaming for help sounded like he was African American and there had recently been a news story about a hate crime happening in the area.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Information on Mood Stabilizers? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-10 00:51:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Age: 18
Sex: Female
Height: 69"
Weight: 106 lbs
Race: Caucasian
Location: California
Existing conditions: Anorexia nervousa, panic disorder, anxiety disorder, major depression (possibility for developing bipolar disorder), insomnia
Current medications: 80 mg Prozac, .25 - .5 mg Xanax (as needed), 20 mg levothyroxine, 50 mg Trazodone, 8 mg Ondansetron (Mylan), medical marijuana


I have some questions about mood stabilizers. I do see a psychiatrist as needed, but I'd like some information before talking to him about this. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12, diagnosed with anorexia nervousa when I was 17, and diagnosed with anxiety when I was 11. I have not been diagnosed with bipolar (I or II) disorder, but I have experience hypomanic episodes in the past. My psych said to keep an eye on these episodes, because I'm at high risk for developing bipolar disorder. 

The past several weeks for me have been pretty good. There were days where I felt like I was walking on sunshine, and that nothing could go wrong. I was also going to sleep very late (sometimes it would be light out when I went to sleep) and then I'd either only get a few hours or sleep, or I'd get 10+ (usually 12 or 13, actually). However, I've had a total change of mood starting last week. I don't know what could've fueled it, but for the past week I've been feeling very depressed. I live at a 4-year university right now, so I'm not with my parents (who live in the area). 

I've also noticed that I've been making very rash decisions. Last night, I got into an argument with a roommate, which ended up making me so upset that I cut myself (I've had an ongoing problem with self-harm for about 6 years now, and HAVE received treatment multiple times). This led to her finding blood in our sink, which led to the Resodent Advisor of our dorm to call the police. I then got questioned over the course of 2 hours whether or not I was suicidal. I am NOT suicidal, though I have been in the past. 

I guess this is sort of a wake-up call for me. So I'm suddenly depressed, not thinking before making decisions, and feeling really aggravated by everything and snippity towards people. I don't know why I'm like this.

What I'm asking for here is advice. I've talked to my doctor briefly about mood stabilizers in the past. Is this an issue that could be helped by stabilizers? I'm already on the highest dose of Prozac I can take for my height and weight. Please, if anyone has any advice or questions, please comment or PM me!

Then later, two guys (one on the grass below, one on the deck above) tossing an empty Jack Daniels bottle back and forth. Luckily they managed to catch it every time.  </TEXT>
