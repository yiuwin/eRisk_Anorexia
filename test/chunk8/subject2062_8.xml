	<TEXT> As /u/Aiyon pointed out in another answer the code is not something that is special to Dan, everybody can get a referral link with a kickback. Beside he is not hiding that he has an affiliate link from Lootcrate, because it's easy to see. Also I don't think he makes the videos because of the link, but because he likes the idea or whatever.

For the Plants vs. Zombies video: It was a "Tests" video meaning he does not freaking research the video. He states so himself in the video. He test a game and gives his impressions for the first time playing it.

 He's not even half as professional as he claims to be.

Please point me to an statement of Dan where claims to be professional. As far as I know he does YouTube because he has fun with it and makes a bit of money. From my knowledge he never claimed that he is professional or unbiased at all. All I know is that he said that he will never do a video about a game if a company aproaches him with a sponsorship (that's at least what I understood).

All in all I think you makeing a big fuss about nothing at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He is not saying that they do it to doge taxes, but that in the US you can write off donations from the taxes. Let's say someone would normally pay $200,000 in taxes and write off $100,000 because of donations, that means that the government gets only half of what it normally would.  
He is not saying what they are doing is per se bad, but that the way they are doing it and asking others to do it may actually not be the best way to do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's kind of complicated as far as I know. If the BGH, the highest court in Germany (except when in matters of constituional law [or whatever it's called in English]), declares that an decision would always be the same, it's for the most part safe to assume that the decision will be same. However it does not have the same binding as a law for lower instances, also the BGH can change what the statue is.

Also publisher would not have to take it to law, they just would have to try to publish a game containing the symbols and then get to court if they have to change it. So when the game get's through and nobody complains about it, not lawsuit no costs.

Thing is unless one or more publisher at least try to get games recognized as art it won't change. It's kind of a typical chicken and egg problem, as long as there is no case where a game got through with it, no publisher will try it, but as long as no publisher tries it. </TEXT>

Not compeltley true, on longer tracks they just have to travel a certain distance.

 My question is, with all of Formula 1's technology and all the very intelligent people who work in the sport, why the fuck can't they just have the cars drop to the back of the pack and then subtract a lap from their total?

Tyre wear and fuel for the most part. It gives the lapped cars an unfair benefit to the cars right in front of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to **part** of my definition of an RPG. Never claimed that the above is the whole definiton.

Did I ever claim that any of the games you picked were an RPG? Please show it to me where I actually claimed that The Walking Dead is an RPG and I mean actually claiming not you impling on one statement from me that I would do so.

Okay, let's pick a Bioware game as you seem to think highly of them. Mass Effect, without question it is an RPG right? Does it let you play as a bad guy? Sort of, but not really. It gives you the illusion that you are the bad guy, but in the end you are still the freaking hero if you want it or not. You save many people and systems, so you are not a bad guy, you are just not as good as you can be. Alas D D does not count, this discussion is about videogames and D D is not a video game, heck D D is not game in itself, D D is a system.

There is no choice in any videogame up so far, all you have is more or less the illusion of choice. I honestly don't know any RPG that has not a limited amount of endings and thus limits your choices throughout the game. The limit may be higher for some and lower for others, but it does not change the fact that they are limiedt. So a game as Fallout 4, which sparked this whole debate, limits you in some ways more than a Mass Effect or Fable, but still it's a freaking RPG.

Last but not least I want to quote the Wikipedia article on RPG, maybe not the best source, but there is no formal definition of RPG.

 A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players **assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting**. Players take responsibility for **acting out these roles within a narrative**, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development.

Emphasis by me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Would you consider "The Secret of Monkey Island" an RPG?

No, but because it lacks other things that define an RPG. An RPG for me contains kind of a leveling and gear system. Neither of which is found in the Point and Click Adventure you mentioned.

 How much freedom do you really have if the story is nigh linear?

The story is not the only thing defining what an RPG is. An RPG is more than the story and frankly a story with much freedom may not belong to an RPG and vice-versa.

 Where would you draw the line?

I would decide from case to case, because there is no clear drawn border, as there is with no genre. Frankly speaking to a degree this thinking in genres is kind of stupid nowadays, because there are so many games that bastards between two or more genres. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I think many people are mistaken about what an RPG is. An RPG does not have to give the player 100% freedom. An RGP is about playing the role of a character. This also means that the character in a game is a good guy, you as a player should not have the freedom to play him as a bad guy. It's not what the character is.

And even through in Fallout 4 you can kind of create your own character, your character is to a degree predefined. It's not an empty paper, (s)he has lived years before the war and (s)he has a kid, those are things that define someone as a person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I think most people talking about this are mistaking novelty for creatively. Even a game like CoD or yes an NFL needs a certain amount of creativity. It's not the same creativity as you may find in a Child of Light and it certainly is not novel, but still.

Also often times those people forget that the publishers and the studios are freaking businesses. I would wager that many and more people working at EA or Ubisoft would like to put up a great novel game with the budget of the latest AC or BF game, but from a business standpoint such a risk may not be worth it. Instead they opt for the "boring" non novel approach, but are making a profit with that.

Another thing is, that the people who are complaining are most likely the minority. Many and more people are okay with how the CoD franchise is the "same" in the last few iterations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  During matches streams should turn off player names entirely and only use the names of the heroes instead.

No, there may be people watching who don't know every hero by name, for them it would be impossible to follow it.

The solution is as simple as not allowing the players to change their names while participating in a tournament begining at the qualifier. They can change the name in non official matches but in the official ones they are required to use the ingame name with which they are registered to the tournament.

 Player names are an unnecessary piece of visual clutter on the stream and useless info in the audio.

Nope, same as in "real" sports the name is a way to identify a person. If you were just to watch the stream on the side without names it would be harder to follow if you can't remember which player got which hero or even worse if you tuned in later.

 They confuse any spectators who don't follow the scene closely.

I don't follow the scene cloesly anymore and I don't have any problems when I watch a game. Same goes for any other sport I may watch. If I have a name to associate with something (e.g. jersey number or hero) I know who the commentators are talking about.

 Fans who care already know which players on the teams play each role, so they don't need to hear the names over and over.

They don't need to, but it makes it easier., </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Using a ten year old engine is honestly unacceptable in a AAA game in this day and age. 

No, it isn't. Most game engines are just iterations of older engines and I'm sure that the eninge used for Fallout 4 is different to the one used in Sykrim, while sharing the same code to a degree. It's a common theme amonst most parts of development, to reuse as much code as you can. The longer you use code the more bugs you may be able to find and fix.

 The time and cost would not have mattered at all if it had made people shit their pants with how amazing it was.

It would've Bethesda is a fucking company not somekind of non profit organization. People have to understand, that game development is business and every decision has to be made with the business in mind. Beside a new engine would introduce a metric ton of new bugs that people would complain about.

 As it stands, all the bugs and relatively poor graphics have brought the Metacritic user score almost 5 full points below the critic score.

Metacritic is not a score I would allow in an argument. It's bullshit and it's easy to forge. Also the graphics are not "relativley poor" they hold up to most games. Sure there are games with way better graphics, but they lack in other parts where Fallout 4 is better. Graphics is not everything and to be honest for me graphics are not as important as the gameplay.

 I have a feeling there are a lot of people like me that are waiting to buy this game, not because it costs too much, but because we're waiting for the community patches that are required to fix Bethesda games.

Didn't need any community patches for Fallout 3 nor New Vegas nor Morrowind. Skyrim I didn't pick up right away, because I didn't feel like it. Maybe I'm just one of the lucky few who do not experience bugs as often or who are just playing to enjoy the game and thus "ignore" some flaws.

 How much revenue is lost to people like me? Enough to fund a new engine, maybe?

No, most likely not. The costs for the eninge don't end when the game is released. For a new enigne they may have to release patches for it, because of bugs in the engine code. If you develop your own engine you will have running costs for the lifetime of it. You can't just develop it and then be done. </TEXT>

I had one or two things spasm out after being hit by an explosion and the most annyoing bug I have encountered is when my PipBoy or my gun is not rendered in first person. When I switch to third person it's all there and I can use it like normal.

In my opinion while far from perfect Fallout 4 feels like one of the better triple-A launches in recent history. I can understand why some people may be dissapointed because they got hyped up way to much, but all in all it's a great game which I will be playing for a long time and even will fire up in a few years. </TEXT>

Anno for me always hat the more mature theme and you are focused on the grander theme of things. You don't have to give every little pathway it's own transportation dude or your wares will stack up. It happens automatic. Also in Settlers there is no statsifaction meter for your people, they are basicly a ressource.

In general for me The Settlers was always more about ressource and micro management, while Anno was more of a settlement simulation where you at one point start focus on building pretty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Through some laws the GEMA is allowed to assume every artist is part of her unless the artist states otherwise. The basic reason behind it is not that bad if you think about it for a second. In the best case it would mean people who want to broadcast music publicy only need to pay the GEMA for the rights to broadcast the music. In practice however the GEMA wants to much and has huge problems.

No, if your party is an private "invite" only party you **do not** need a permit. Only if you want your party to be public you need it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Yeah you EU always have an excuse for the violence in other countries.

Excuse? Are you dim? I said that we in the fucking west are the reason that there is so much fucking violence in Africa. Also I never excused the violence but said that it stems from different things, that does not make the violence in any shape or form better.

 Violence is violence no matter your bias.

Right, so why can't you accept there is proof that countries with stricter gun lawys have less violent crimes with guns involved?

  You're also biased against guns or scared of guns so it's not like anybody can have a serious conversation with you about them.

Nope I couldn't actually care less abot guns. I don't see many reasons to own one sure. But I'm not scared of a thing, if at all I would be scared of the person wielding the gun.

 You're 100% wrong about guns being used only to kill. I bet your politicians are protected by people with guns. Their children. Your queen.

A gun when used has the purpose to kill. A bodyguard having a gun is only protecting because of the inherit threat that he will use the gun against you if you dare to threaten the person he protects. Still the usage of a gun is to kill.

Same goes for all pure weapons that ever existed. They are tools to kill, not to protect. For example a sword is only a good sword if it can kill, it's a tool for killing. Same goes for a gun, no matter how many times you try to deny it.


Edit: Also I don't have a queen nor a king. The last monarch in my country was thrown over way before my time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  America doesn't have a monoply on violence

Nobody claims that, but for "the" developed country there are shockingly many mass killings and gun related deaths.

 Last I checked, Mexico, the Mid-East, Africa, all kill eachother like it's going out of style.

Last I checked Mexico was basicly in war against the drug cartels, Mid-East is in many parts an acutal war zone, Africa has been put into it's position by the west. None of them are really that comparable to the U.S.

 Hell, the EU has plenty of wackos but instead of getting shot, you'll just get your head cut off in the street or stabbed to death in an Ikea.

Yes, the EU has wackos and yes bad things happen, but relativly speaking they are happening far less and are for the most part far less deadly. A gun is made for one purpose and one purpose alone to kill whatever is in front of it. A knife is a multipurpose tool, which can be used to kill something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of english is not my first language so I may misuse a word or two, feel free to correct me.

I didn't cut myself for cutting myself. For me it started because I wanted to hurt myself for reasons, but I was to much of a wus to do any "real" harm. Then I noticed how the pain it created made all the emotional pain and turmoil feel mundane, it "helped" me cope with all the penned up anger, pain and turmoil in me. Then it started to escalate to the point where I was mere seconds from endig myself then and there. But something always got in "the way".

I'm not really cutting myself anymore, though I still hurt myself when I'm in emotional stress. Maybe I pound on the wall with my fist until it bleeds or I take a piece of metal and heat it up until it's glowing red and press it against my body or I bite my cheek until I taste the sweet blood of mine.

I know it's not healthy and I know I should seek help, but I'm getting by currently so I postpone it. </TEXT>

True, but since I don't insult or get all grabby with anybody, I would say that the possibilty that I'm precieved as respectful is quite high.

 yes. but if that guy lays down $500 says "insert stupid shit here" are you still gonna serve him?

I'm not gonna, because I'm not a server. I'm here because I like the stories, they are interesting. But I didn't service a customer once who was screaming at me (I work tech support). He was paying good money.

 Nobel prize winner seems to think otherwise You ever see someone frowning on a wave runner? You ever see a skydiver not having the time of their life? Those things are free right? 

You didn't get my point. I'm not saying that money is not important at all, neither in the passage not in the emphasied part. All I said that up to certain point money is important to happiness, beyond that point it looses it's important. So people who don't need as much money to reach that point are in my opinion richer in life than the ones who need more money.

Also the link you provided aggrees with what I said. After a certain threshold the line is flat. The actual value varies from person to person and I said persons for who the value is lower are better off imho. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Yes money does equal happiness and you are bullshitting yourself otherwise.

Yes and no. Up to certain point yes after that no. There are more things to happiness than money. It's a part of it, but honestly someone who can be happy with less is more rich than a person who needs more to be happy.

  This is the most toxic sub I've ever been on

This sub is for servers to rant. That's all to it. Now and then there are nice stories, but for the most part it's for renting. Just like all the other Tales From subs.

 actually it does, if you say something disrespectful in a democratic society the people will sort it out, you are asking people to be respectful while drinking beer and slamming shots, thats like asking Picasso to paint the Mona Lisa

That's not how a democracy works. Free speach just protects you against the state to prosecute you for stupid shit you spew and not from persons or private institutions. I can't even fathom how people seem to think that.

I know many people who are respectful while drinking even while drinking heavily. Myself included, I never understand what people are getting from being a dick to a bartender/server or anybody else in the service industry. It's just stupid and useless.
