	<TEXT> Thank you. I appreciate the support. I know a lot of people would say to press charges, that that's what I need to do. And they're probably right. But I'm scared of what happens after that. I'm scared of what he'd do to me if I went that far. I'm scared enough as is just trying to start a restraining order. I don't know. Maybe I'm just too close to the situation and I'm blowing it out of proportion. But it seems like a really, really big first step that I'm not sure I make. And then.... part of me feels guilty. Like I don't want to ruin his life with rape charges putting him in prison or whatever ya know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I struggle with that a little bit. I feel incredibly responsible for what he's done to other girls because I could have stopped it three years ago by saying something. But I didn't. I just let him keep doing what he's doing.


And sometimes... It's almost easier to lay a little bit of blame on myself for what happened with us. I know it's not completely my fault. But I just really don't want to get stuck in that mentality where I'm angry at him and at the world for what happened. It seems really unfair sometimes. But I don't want to be like that because I know people have it worse. I don't want to end up bitter and angry. So if I tell myself it's my fault, I can't get mad at anyone else for it happening. I'm sure that maybe isn't the healthiest way to deal with it. But I don't really know what else to do or how else to process it. If that makes any sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been to a few meetings. I went pretty consistently until I picked up my 30 days, then promptly lost that and I haven't been back since.. I can't get there a whole ton with my new work schedule either. But I guess that's just kind of me making excuses for not wanting to go back.

I ran into him again today. For the first time in the three years that things have happened in fairly public places, someone actually did come up and ask if everything was okay because he was starting to get a bit rough. That was weird. I mean, I appreciate it. So much. But it's embarrassing in a way ya know? Like I need to be taken care of or I can't hold my own. That's a little hard for me to deal with. I don't know. Things are just crazy right now I guess and I'm not super equipped to deal with it yet. I just need to figure out how to get him out of my life and wade through the shit he left in my head. That's proving a little more difficult than I thought it would be. Thank you for the support though. I really do appreciate it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Opening Up (Sorry for length) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> First of all, I'm sorry if this gets lengthy and makes no sense. I just need to empty my head. I don't mean for this to be a pity-me post in any way at all. There are just some things that I'm realizing I need to open up about and be honest about if I'm EVER going to succeed at getting clean. I'm so scared and I don't know if I'm ready to tell the people in my life the things I need to. This sub has been  a saving grace for me. So even if no one reads this, I need to get it out.

I'm 18 years old. I'm a freshman in college. Dream job, lobbyist. There's no way I'll ever get anywhere near there as a drug addict. I can't even tell anyone that that's what I want with my life. They all just laugh and say yeah right, be serious. That makes me so sad. I was about 15 when I had my first taste of opiates. It wasn't anything dramatic. My boyfriend, who was 18 at the time, just handed me a few pills and told me to take them. I'd been drunk and smoked before. But this.. was different. It was really an issue for a while. Every now and then, he'd hand me something, I'd take them without question. And then things..changed. He changed. I couldn't do anything right. He was always angry. I never knew why. I'd never had a boyfriend before, I was young. One day, I guess he just kinda snapped. I remember so clearly the first time he hit me. Looking back I just want to scream at myself to get the fuck away from him from that first time. But I just didn't know what to do. I left, started walking home. He pulled up next to me and apologized. I didn't know what to do. So I just got in his truck and went back to his house with him. That was the first night I felt like I needed the little white pills he gave me to numb out what was going on in my head. It got worse. And worse. I was spending more time getting ready in the mornings covering bruises than anything else. He was giving me pills more and more frequently. I was getting addicted without really even realizing it. When he'd get mad or have a bad day or something and come at me, I'd be telling myself that it would be okay and I get handle it because he'd give me something later. It was just getting so out of control. It all kind of blew up when he decided it was time for me to lose my virginity whether I wanted to or not. He was bigger than me so it didn't matter to him that I said no, that I was BEGGING him to stop. I finally got the guts to break up with him about a month after the first time. It's been three years today since the first time he took that from me. The past three years have been hell. I tried so hard to just pretend it didn't happen. But I could only keep it out of my head for so long. My use went up drastically. Things would flare every now and then with him. He'd leave me alone for a while. Then he'd start trying to get in touch with me, telling me he missed me. Or threatening me if I ever tried to tell anyone. The past 4 or 5 months (coincidentally about the same amount of time I've been trying to get clean) have been really bad. I think there's another girl getting ready to press charges. He's been pushing me a lot harder. I do the best I can to ignore him and stay away from him. But it's to the point that I leave the gym and he's waiting by my car. Or he's parked outside my apartment complex. I know it isn't excuse. But every time something happens with him, whether he's just talking shit or hitting me around or just..showing up somewhere. I break and call my dealer. I know people have way worse situations or have been through worse and handled it much better I do. And I know I can't blame my use on him. But I'm realizing, I feel like I CANNOT stay clean with him even vaguely a part of my life. I don't know how to deal with what he did to. I still have nightmares about it all time.  I still struggle with day to day life because of it sometimes. I don't quite know how to fix what he broke inside of my head. But I'm realizing drugs aren't doing it. When I come down, the mess is still there. I'm trying to get something done. It's taken me three fucking years, but I've finally got the balls to do something. I think. I started the process of getting a restraining order. I thought about pressing charges. But I'm so so scared. I haven't told anyone in my life that I'm doing anything at all. I'm terrified of what he's going to do to me because I spoke up. Part of me just wants to drop everything all together because I don't know if I'm strong enough to deal with the drama that's going to open up. I just..... don't know what to do anymore. 

It breaks my heart that I know he's done this to other girls. I feel so, so guilty for that. It's my fault. If I'd said something 3 years ago, maybe I could have saved them the same pain. I hate myself for the part I played in their heartache. Because I know exactly how awful it is and how much it fucks with every. single. part. of your life. I know what it did to mine. I'm angry and hurt and sad and confused and bitter and guilty and mad at myself and just...everything else. I don't even know how to explain it. I just feel so stuck on it. Like no matter what I do, I can't get it out of my head. I miss feeling safe. I don't get that every anymore.


Sorry again that this was a novel. If anyone actually read through it all. haha. I just... I know I'm never going to get and stay clean unless I figure this shit out first. I know there are a lot things that play into my drug use. But this is my biggest trigger and struggle. I don't know how, but I have to figure this out. And I will never be able to do that if I don't open my mouth and speak up about it. Thank you for giving me a place to open up and trying to figure shit out. You're all awesome. Much love. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I really appreciate that. I've just... got a lot of things going on in my life right now that aren't going super smoothly I guess. I'm just feeling really overwhelmed. There are some things happening right now that I didn't think I'd be able to handle ever. at all. Doing it sober seems impossible right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I really appreciate the support. It just seems like lately, there isn't a day I wake up and don't think about how easy it would to make a call and get something to take the edge off of life a little bit. There's just.. a lot of stuff going on right now that I didn't think I'd be dealing with at this point in life. Or ever really. I'm stressing pretty hard core. I know in the end it won't make anything better. And it will probably make everything worse if I'm being honest with myself. But I keep thinking.. It might make the path there a little bit easier. I'm trying to shut that voice out. I just feel like I'm getting really overwhelmed and I don't know what to do or how to handle what's going on. I really, really appreciate the support. I hope you keep on the path you're going down, getting clean and staying that way. Keep your head up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really struggling tonight. Well, the past couple of months to be honest. I've had a lot of shit come up the past little while. Just one of those rough patches where it feels like life is throwing every shitty thing it can at you all at once. I know it happens to everyone and that's just how life is. But I'm just really having a hard time with it right now. I've been struggling to get much clean time at all lately. I just needed to talk to someone, get a little support or advice. I didn't know where to go, so I came here. Hope you all are staying strong, loving life.

	<TEXT> Thanks for the advice. I really appreciate it. I guess part of it is also that I'm afraid to bring it up with anyone. I've worked really hard to get those close to me to believe that I'm better now. And for a while I really thought I was. I don't know. I guess I just don't really know what I'd say. The possible fallouts to it scare me too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First time posting here, so I'm sorry if this doesn't fit requirements.

When I was 15 I was hospitalized and put in a treatment center for anorexia. I was hospitalized again a little over a year ago at 17. Since then, I've actually been doing really well. Or like.. I thought I was. I moved out of my parents' house in May, started college, and am currently working on getting clean off heroin and other opiates. I don't know what's happened. But since I made the decision to get clean.. The old habits are coming back. Really strong. I can feel myself slipping back into my eating disorder.. But the thing is... I'm not really doing anything to stop it. I don't know why. I don't have a good answer. It concerns me a little bit how NOT concerned I am about this mindset and these actions coming back.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Be careful where you smoke and with who. I don't know where you live, but just keep in mind that unfortunately it is still illegal a lot of places. One of my best friends has a felony on his record from when he was 16 because of marijuana related things. 4 years later, he is also currently facing possession charges (not a felony, but still. It's so sad to me.) Just keep that in mind.  

Enjoy. Don't let smoking habits become solely about the weed itself. When you smoke with friends (if you do) don't get together just to smoke. Like... smoke a bowl, but focus on enjoying the conversations and each others company. If that makes sense... 

Stay lifted, enjoy life to the fullest. :) </TEXT>
