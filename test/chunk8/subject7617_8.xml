	<TEXT> Best: literally trying on the dresses. I had so much fun just walking out and seeing myself in all these different dresses! And it helps the place i bought mine was run by this lovely lady who didnt put any pressure on me to buy.
Worst: I honestly was in the boat of liking multiple dresses, like, a lot. There wasn't a "one" there was like...three that i loved. And so i had to just make a decision, even though any of the three would've been great. I was hoping there would be one that was a cut above the rest, but that never really happened for me, so it made decision making harder! </TEXT>

October is my favorite time of year to go (and ive been there 12 times, #13 upcoming in 2 weeks. yeah im one of those people). And there will always be kids. I mean, my parents took me out of school to go twice, because they didnt want to go in the sweltering heat of summer. Key here is get to parks when they open. seriously, you'll get so much done, and by afternoon you'll be able to take it slower. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every time i look up short wedding hair styles, they give me hair between chin and shoulders. Mine is much shorter. at it's "longest" when i need a cut, its almost chin length. A fresh cut puts it much shorter, like mid cheek length.  there's not much i can "do" with it at that length, like stylistically, but im trying to decide what to do for hair pieces. Was leaning towards a halo or headband. Is that what other short haired gals are doing? does anyone have any pics i can reference? thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. We are not traditional in that we feel we have to wait until walking down the aisle, or that it's "Bad luck" or anything like that. It makes sense logistically to have a first look in Central Park, 2 blocks away from the venue, and then do all the photos before the ceremony so there will be no mid event photos to take us away from the fun! Also, i think if we see each other ahead of time, it'll mean less nerves during the ceremony. And i'd love to have that time together before hand. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My BHLDN Experience (Rave!) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-05 17:49:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know there's a lot of mixed feels here about BHLDN and even the two locations here in NYC have very mixed reviews online. But i gave it a shot last weekend and went to the one in the UES. Here's my [album of some of my favorite dresses i tried on](http://imgur.com/a/NWaev). I almost bought the Cassia, but if you guys saw my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/62wj9w/said_yes_to_the_dress_today_if_your_initials_are/), I went with a totally different Essense of Australia dress at a different place!

Anyway, first my stylist was Maria, and she was a pleasure. No pushyness, no rushing, as some people seemed to have experienced at the location. No champagne in a can either though, maybe because it was only noon? ha. She had all the dresses i asked for online when i made the appt and let me pick a few extras. Had 3 people with me which was totally fine. You do have to show off your dress in basically a pretty public viewing area, where i was surrounded by women trying on bridesmaid dresses and another bride to be, so if having total stranger comment on your dress isnt your thing, dont do it! (they were all VERY nice to me, btw, no mean comments ha).

The samples are a bit...raggedy. Especially if you look at the back of the Cassia, its pretty stepped on and dirty. That was disappointing. Also she put a belt immediately on with the dress, which i guess was kind of an upsell if i had gotten it, but to be frank, it looked 10x better with the belt.

I told her I had another appt after, there was no pressure, just a business card with the dress and belt names and price and her name. Their stuff is GORGEOUS but ultimately i picked something that i think suited my evening NYC wedding better. But if you want that boho princess/fairytale look for a good price, id go for it. The Freesia is only $900, for example!

Anyway, i just wanted to share my positive experience overall. If anyone has any questions let me know! </TEXT>

We also added a small $200 fund that anyone can contribute any amount to, to help us grow our vinyl collection! things like that.

	<TEXT> AS a big Disney World goer (I have an annual pass, yadda yadda), I can tell you it will NOT be a relaxing trip. Yes, there are relaxing things to do there, but if you havent been before, or havent been in years, you'll probably push all that to the wayside to get to see and do everything else. I agree you need a city/state where you've got stuff to do and see but also beaches or spas and other relaxing areas. San Fran as mentioned is great, Santa Monica too. 

FH and I are generally adventurous travelers, but he surprised me by saying he too wanted some chill on a beach and do nothing time. So we're doing Thailand, Cambodia,   Vietnam, and half of that time will be spent at beachside resorts and the other half doing temple tours/city stuff. I'm looking forward to the mix! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the [imgur link](http://imgur.com/a/LKSCv) that also shows off the back. I tried this on 3 weeks ago, and then today I went to BHLDN and tried on the Cassia dress and thought it was it.  And trust me guys, that dress is beautiful! but it felt more outdoor/daytime wedding and this felt more like the evening, classic NYC wedding im having. I went back today to try it on after BHLDN and yeah... it was still it. I don't think either dress would've been the wrong decision, and it was definitely tough, but this one ultimately won out! It's Essense of Australia. </TEXT>

I think Ho Chi Minh city with any day trips we can do; he's super into war history so he wants to see the museums. I imagine we'll be doing 4 days there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Iceland is wonderful, i went there 2 years ago and it was such a great time! Definitely take time to get on some of those long drives outside of the city, though. the landscape is beautiful. and definitely do blue lagoon! You can also horseback ride across volcanic rock. it's lovely there! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A great photographer will help you feel more relaxed, but in general, its going to be weird at first. It totally was for me! We just did ours last weekend. First 30 minutes I felt really awkward giving him kisses on the cheek etc. Then i started to just go with the flow, and sometimes in between shots id relax and start just laughing with him, and didnt really realize the the photographer was still taking pics haha. We also had to pretend we werent freezing in windy and rainy weather, but we did it! you'll be OK! i promise. expect awkwardness at first, but i promise it'll get better. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Frames for Wedding Signs? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-31 04:45:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all, I am looking to do a couple of print outs from etsy, one for the bar, one for a memorial table, and maybe one other. Where did you get frames for your wedding signs? I saw some awesome vintage ones on etsy but of course, pricier than i would hope. Our wedding will be held at [The Harold Pratt House](http://www.pratthouse.com/) which has a 1920s vibe, and so our sign print outs will be Gatsby like...so preferably vintage or gold frames would work. Im not opposed to doing a little DIY spray painting though! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to first preface by saying im very lucky that my  FH's family is well off, and wants to pay for our wedding (and they arent crazy and want to make all the decisions either, they are literally letting us do what we want!).  So, catering is a splurge. Though i mean, catering in manhattan is expensive no matter what. But we're going with a caterer that is going to cost us about 33k. (keep in mind though generally they are about 25k).

We're also going to splurge 2 nights at a suite at the Gramercy Park Hotel for the night before and night of the wedding, since we aren't doing our honeymoon until 2 months later :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did not have any prepared undergarments, as I have no idea what im going to wear under until i know my dress! However, i wore a strapless bra which my attendant prefer i take off because it just took away from the back of a lot of them, plus a few styles had built in cups. I dont think it'll be awkward to do solo at all, im sure thousands of brides go solo all the time, and they are experienced in this! Besides, id say a huge chunk of my time was spent talking to and getting to know my attendant during dress changes, and my FMIL was involved only when i stepped out to look in the mirror, but iwouldve been fine solo! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> so my dad is giving us $20k as well, and we said it was too much!!! Especially with my FH's parents paying for a big chunk of the wedding already. He saw it as "fine, use 10k, keep 10k as a wedding gift." Sure, we could go a little more crazy with vendors/wedding budget, but we're pretty happy with what we've got, and so keeping that $$ as a couple sounds more like what we want to do with it anyway. So, talk to them about the amount. Ask them if you can accept it as more of a gift, for a future car, house down payment, etc. It'll go a lot farther! </TEXT>
