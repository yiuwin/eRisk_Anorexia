	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Look. I really enjoy this league, and I at no point thought it would get this far. As not only a mod, but one of the founders of this league, it was inappropriate to set an improper example. At no point was it my intention to corrupt the league so much. I have decided to come out and formally apologize for my actions. I take full responsibility, and respect any decision /u/JCGospel177 decides to relinquish upon me. Once again, my most sincere apologies. Please forgive me, as I have come to know, you want a clean league to play in. And if I am not banned let alone allowed to be a mod, and there is a solid chance I will be, (banned, not allowed back as a mod) I promise it will be my number one priority to crack down on others who have stumbled down the same path I once did.

Sincerest apologies,

/u/subject4410

Edit: I am apologizing for making a second account and using it to control more players, and still lying and denying it despite strong evidence against me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe the expense setting affect rating slightly, like scouting affects the ratings of players in the draft the the AI teams might not "see." For them to be the best they just have to be ranked #1 in the league, but they don't need to the crazy high, just the most. Say the #1 team is spending $23.04M, spending $23.05M is the same as spending $30M. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am one of the founders of the league. I don't care how much evidence there is. There would be no reason for me to cheat. I was actually the maker of both trade threads, the In-season FA thread, and I have contributed significantly to the league in other ways. I was the first mod. You want to know my story fine. Here goes: Me and the chef r roommates irl. He has been playing BBall GM for about 1 year. He didn't understand the multiplayer leagues at first, but when I explained and showed him how easy they are, he was like, "Count me in!" It's easy to not think about talking over Reddit when ur like I can Talk to him at dinner 2nite. We talked in person at dinner a few nights ago, and came up with that trade. I said, "I just traded LMA  and Pau Gasol to the Bulls to crap out my team, but I forgot about Kawhi, any chance you want him?" And he replied, "Sure, whaddya want, a few young guys + some picks since ur rebuilding your team?" To which I replied, "Sound fine, but we should put a little of our convo on Reddit so they don't know we are friends." Then once it got obvious we gave up and announced it.  We both play from our desktop apple computer, since it's cheaper than us both having laptops. So there you have. The complete and entirety of the story.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The title may be a little misleading. This does not exist. I know that myself, and probably many other people would like to see a roster from the 2009-10 season, partly because it was such an exciting year, and partly because it has so many "What if"s such as:

What if D Rose never got injured?

What if LeBron Stays in Cleveland?

What if the Thunder Big 3 plays out? and so on and so forth.

Upvote and comment on this post if you agree and maybe /u/alexnoob or /u/LordJugo could try and put one together, or if this gets over 20 upvotes, I'll try and put one together myself (Haha that probs won't happen.)  </TEXT>
