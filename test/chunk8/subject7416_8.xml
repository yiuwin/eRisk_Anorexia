Also how likely do you think it is that someone who has never watched Game of Thrones would name their kids Khaleesi? 

Because my point still stands, people are most likely fans of the show, because of that you'd think they would consider the context and meaning of the name, and not just what it sounds like.  </TEXT>

That being said, my point was that it is hard to take anything you say seriously when you write vitriolic shit like that. It seems more like you're angry that it was a Trump/conservative thing then it was a free speech thing.  </TEXT>

Or maybe they don't want to sleep with a self-loathing weirdo who refers to women as "females"... also while some people have won the gene pool, you act as if you can't make yourself more or less attractive through life decisions. 
There is such a self-improvement you know, you can start eating more healthy, you can exercise, you can get a better haircut, you can wear better clothes, you can try to improve other appealing qualities except the physical. Because women also like men that are funny, and kind, and smart, and caring, what they don't like however is whatever you are doing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could understand that argument if it was about some suburban white kids hopping on trends and treating hip hop like a novelty act, but Eminem is nothing like that. I am not crazy about his music, but it is completely unfair to talk about Eminem as if he isn't someone who has a great deal of respect for the genre.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I might remember it incorrectly, but I feel like most scenes went something like this:

Black haired girl: Something something sexual

*laughter*

Blonde girl: I used to be rich once, I don't know how these things work

Black haired girl: something something edgy and dark

*laughter*

Magical negro: I am just a folksy elderly black man, something something cool and charming

*laughter*

Asian dude: I am angry at you for some reason

Black haired girl: You're so short, hahahah

*laughter*

Offensive Eastern European stereotype guy: Hey sexy lady, you want the fuck?

*laughter*

Black haired and blonde girl: Oh you

	<TEXT> You should also know some more aggressive music and some more soft indie stuff as well, just to cover all your bases. You don't want to talk about Mumford and Sons is she is a die-hard Elliott Smith fan for an instance. 

So you should try to figure out what kinda white girl she is first, if you wanna get with an art-haux for an instance you should probably talk about Mac Demarco, Fidlar, Bon Iver, The Smiths, Of Montreal, and possibly Modest Mouse. Like this is a whole scientific field... If I had the time i'd write up a comprehensive guide of white girl music.   </TEXT>
