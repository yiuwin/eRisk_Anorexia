	<TEXT> Hey guys,

This is my first post in this forum, but I have enjoyed reading through the comments and questions on here.

In the church, we are not asked to vote a particular way, but we are encouraged to research the candidates, pray, and vote in good conscience. However, my question is this: If we are all members of the church, praying to God, asking who we should vote for, shouldn't we all end up voting for the same person?

How can one person receive an answer to vote for one candidate while another person receives an answer to vote for another. Shouldn't there be a right and wrong answer in this case? I am curious to see what peoples thoughts are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For my work Christmas party, we are going up to North Forty Escapes to go dog sledding and snowmobiling. I didn't even realize that was a thing here in Utah, and so I am pretty excited about it.

Just thought I'd share this with people who may have family coming in town for the holidays and are looking for something fun and unique to do. It could be a nice midweek break from skiing. 

Here is the link for anybody interested: [http://northfortyescapes.com/](http://northfortyescapes.com/) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  most are either really expensive or require people to change their habits

I agree with this. I agree that there is more that the government could do to lower the pollution and keep the air cleaner, but a large part of the problem comes from people being unwilling to change their car driving habits. 

Besides just taking public transit or riding your bike, carpooling really helps. My girlfriend just got a job located near mine, so we have started carpooling, cutting down the use for 2 cars to 1 car.

If more people started carpooling, we'd benefit in multiple ways from having cleaner air to clearing up the freeway.

	<TITLE> Removing Right Column Ads On Facebook </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-02 23:04:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Facebook recently updated their Placement option in Ads Manager which forces me to select only between placing my ads on Facebook, Instagram, or the Audience Network. 

I liked the old system where I could deselect the Desktop Right Column option. Does anybody know a way that I can still do that? Or am I stuck having to display my ads on the right column (where they tend to get a worse CTR). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey,

I am wondering which ad format you find more effective? I have been running responsive ads as opposed to the old text ad format because I love the option of adding an image, but I don't like that I can't use the dynamic {COUNTDOWN} script. 

Which ad format gets you better results? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You also can't run Display Network campaigns, which means you are limited to Search Campaigns at a $2.00 CPC. 

It's a good idea and if they don't have anything set up, it can help them bring in traffic, however, there are enough limitations that it makes competing for ad ranking difficult.

	<TITLE> Best Wedding Venues in SLC </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey SLC Reddit, 

I recently got engaged and am now looking for a creative and inexpensive location to have my wedding reception. 

We are trying to be frugal because weddings can easily get out of hand, and we'd rather save our money for doing fun things after our wedding than just spending it all on our wedding day.

Any suggestions are appreciated, and if you have any outdoor locations, we are hoping for that the most. 

Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey,

I have a music festival coming up in August and I am looking to put up some posters in some shops in downtown SLC. 

Our target audience focuses on Millennials, mostly college ages, but from 18-30. 

Where are the best shops or places to hang up posters around SLC where they won't be torn down? </TEXT>
