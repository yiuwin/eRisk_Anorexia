	<TEXT> Hello, everyone!  

I started studying Japanese in high school, which at this point I'm afraid to admit was 14 years ago.  I never gained fluency out of school, though I had continued my studies a few years into college.  After I had graduated, my husband had started to study the language while he was in undergrad, and I began to realize that I was forgetting how to say certain things.  I decided that I was GOING to be fluent one day.  

Fast forward 5 years and here I am...still uh...not fluent.  But far better off.  Every year I kickstart my studies into gear again and do really well for the first few months of the year until things trail off.  I'm ready for a new motivation and something to keep me going long into 2017.  

I do also plan on getting a tutor this year, as I am finally in a life situation where I think I can probably swing the cost, so if I'm financially investing in this pursuit, I'm hoping that's all the more motivation for me. 

Thank you all, I'm really excited to see where 2017 takes us all, good luck!  </TEXT>

Anyways, watching what Bill Nye has turned into has really bummed me out in a way it shouldn't. Loved the guy as a kid, he taught me so much, but the way he talks now just seems so... Hateful. I don't know...

She gave legitimate reasons for why she needs time off.  Of course, there's always going to be a "the truth is in the middle" aspect to these stories, but regardless, she does at least seem to have a decent reason for wanting time off, and more notice before her next fight.  IMO.  </TEXT>

The scene out by the pool at night is one of my favorite scenes to watch of all time.

	<TEXT> YES! Oh I forgot about that one.  See, one of the reasons I wanted to start a discussion about this.  I want a reference list of scenes to go to, so I can kinda build up a better visual idea for what I'd like to do someday, should I ever stop being lazy and actually film something in the future. 

This scene has it all, though.  Smoke, Music, Great action, and similar to what I like so much about the scene in Fright Night, it just leaves you really antsy on the edge of your seat because there's so much suspense built up over the course of the scene. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, just a random thought, but over the last few years, I've come to notice that I really enjoy those (mostly useless) club scenes that seem to have a tendency to pop up in 80s movies. 

Some of the scenes that come to mind, for me, first are Fright Night, Brain Damage, the boardwalk stuff from Lost Boys and Tuff Turf.  Huh, that's actually a lot of horror movies, I just realized. 
 
Anyways, the music and the cinematography of those scenes just really grabs me.  Does anyone else share a love for these types of scenes, and what are your favorites, if so?   </TEXT>

On Friday, especially, I was feeling particularly down.  That was the day where I let myself think I wasn't feeling so depressed anymore, and then one little thing happened and I found myself right back on the ledge.  

I so happened to log in here, saw one little post that made me smile despite how bad I felt, so I clicked another and another, and soon I was really laughing.  Throughout the rest of the day, when I started feeling a little gloomy again, I just came over here to see that there were people I could commiserate with, who were also still laughing and trying to find the humor in the situation. 

Thank you for getting me off the ledge on Friday.  It meant everything in those moments to smile.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They answered the question in the episode when Red killed Sam. Twice. First to Sam with the, 'you will always be her father speech,' and a second time to Tom right afterwards with the, 'her father will always be there.' speech. 

The Internet kept this silly crusade going, not the writers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If tonight wasn't enough for you to understand Red's logic on this topic, I don't know what is. 

Are you her father? It doesn't matter. 
Are you her father? You raised her as your own you are her father. 
Are you her father? Sam is her father. 

Are you her father? Yes. 

So look, he's her biological father, but he doesn't feel that he has any claim to call her his own. He refers to the death of her father the night of the fire, but in ALL likelihood at this point, he's talking about a metaphorical death to the person he was, and he feels he is someone else now, and not someone who can claim her as his daughter. 

In his eyes he didn't lie to her. He manipulated the truth to protect her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no idea what his character's name is, but my favorite recurring - character - who - never - speaks is the guy I refer to as The Dude. He's like the leader of Red's team? And kinda looks like Jeff Bridges if you squint. Something about him showing up week after week, kicking ass, but saying nothing cracks me up. That actor has the most developed extra role ever.  </TEXT>

I did.
