	<TEXT> I guess I wasn't talking box office, but I'm pretty sure War Dogs did decent. And The Spectacular Now did very well with critics, don't think it flopped either so only the Shitty Allegiant movies or whatever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say Miles Teller has a better filmography at this point. Barely, since they each share one of their best movies but still. Shailene really only has a supporting role in The Descendents and now Big Little Lies, whereas Miles Teller has a lead in Whiplash and War Dogs as well as some good supporting roles.  </TEXT>

I never said you cant have an opinion but obviously im going to argue against it when you make insanely bold claims. But thank you for insulting me during a civil debate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The scene isnt funny because hes talking out of his ass, its the fact that a grown man in a professional setting would do that and expect to be taken seriously. The comedy of that also comes from the fact that he is clearly an idiotic manchild, but is extremely talented at being a pet detective and manages to get the job done. Thats the point of Ace Ventura and for you to completely miss that point is why I think you don't understand comedy, or just refuse to be open minded. Mr.Bean is also the definition of over the top stupid comedy, yet hes your favourite comedy actor? Even if you say youre not a particular fan of that, how can you discount someone like Jack Black in Bernie just because you didnt like him in School of Rock? I also dont enjoy "dreck" because I like some of the most popular comedies of all time. I feel like the only comedy you enjoy is the stuff that allows you to lord your intelligence and wit over others, while misjudging all other forms. Believe me, there are tons of shitty comedy movies, I could list a ton, but movies like School of Rock, Austin Powers, The Mask, Tommy Boy, etc are not among them. </TEXT>

Out of curiosity, what comedy actors do you like then? Also Jim Carrey still does his regular schtick in The Truman Show, and is quite funny in it outside of the drama.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying that's not all that comedy is, but to deny that a lot of good comedy roles are over the top is straight up incorrect. Jim Carrey does over the top great, as does Jack Black, as does Eddie Murphy (for the most part), as did Chris Farley, as does Mike Myers often, etc. You can't say none of these people are good actors can you?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have seen over the top characters done very poorly, Dewey Finn is an example of the opposite, as is his character in Tropic Thunder. He definitely does more than make faces. To say over the top takes no talent is absurd, haven't you ever heard how many actors say comedy is harder than drama? You didn't even acknowledge his acting in movies like Bernie. Also School of Rock is a near perfect family film that also works well for adults, done by one of the greatest directors working today.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jack Black has many good non goofy roles like Bernie, The D Train, and The Holiday. He's also one of the best at playing over the top characters as seen in Tropic Thunder and School of Rock. I think you're judging a little harshly. Also I'm not even a huge Kevin Hart fan but to judge him for being in Scary Movie 3 (good) and 4 (not that bad) before he was famous is ridiculous.  </TEXT>

But being a meme for being trashy and stupid isn't cool especially since everyone with a brain either makes fun of her or feels sorry for her. Also just because someone is given money doesn't make them cool. You don't seem to understand what the word cool even means. This kid is just being paid to keep being an idiot. Not even in a way that could ever be described as "cool" like say Jackass. It's just a kid with no guidance who's being most likely exploited now by her parents, since we all know she's not getting that fucking money.  </TEXT>
