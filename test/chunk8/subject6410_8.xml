	<TEXT>  what if Finn were to be killed somehow?

I hope they dont do this. I know it is definitely possible though given that Star Wars has a history of major characters dying (episode 3 in particular and more recently rogue 1) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi 
ive read many reviews and watched many videos on this phone and all seem to indicate it is not worth it. The main reason being that its got a poor battery life and is littered with bloatware.

Does anyone here own one and can say otherwise? The reviews seem a little biased or published around the time of the phones initial release (prior to it getting updates)

I currently have an Xperia M and looking to replace it. Other options within my budget are the Samsung J5 Prime and the Moto g4 play. Out of all these though, i like the look of the Xperia XA the best.

	<TEXT> I have not seen it many times like the others but right this very second, i would say this is my list of favourite movies in descending order:

* Empire Strikes Back
* A New Hope (2nd... but only just)
* Rogue One
* The Phantom Menace 
* Return of the Jedi
* Revenge of the Sith
* The Force Awakens
* Attack of the Clones

Rogue One is well up there because of the many many things my brain is still trying to process. [hover only if seen movie](/s "Tarkin, Vader, Leia"), Chirrut, ancient Jedi Temple on Jedha, hammerhead ships, Kyle Katarn references everywhere, the new tie fighters etc etc etc etc

	<TEXT> Although it would be best to leave Kyle for later. Let Disney practice getting other re-introduced characters right first like Thrawn and whoever else they introduce. It would be a major shame if a re-introduced Katarn was nerfed to some lame side-character who doesnt kick ass.

Edit: Also i know Hera = Jan, but Kyle needs Jan </TEXT>

Correct me if im wrong but i think you are missing the Dark Forces books (the Kyle Katarn stories). I think they should be a part of this collection </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Episode 4,5,6,1,2,3,7
but make sure you give plenty of background info and explanations. Especially the context which the movies where made in.

Going to episode 1 first is fine too, but Episode 4 in my opinion is a much better introduction to the whole saga. IE Obi wan explaining the Force, Jedi knights and so on. Episode 1 doesnt really explain that much 

Edit: if u watch Episode 4 now, then you can wait some time and then go watch R1 in cinemas </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Antron Bach, seller of Jedi artifacts and Master Uvell </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-18 04:18:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> While browsing through wookieepedia articles, i discovered [this one](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Antron_Bach) that might interest some people about the character Antron Bach.

I find it interesting that this character and his story in "The End of History" has been around since December 9 2014 yet havent seen it talked about on here before. 
There are a few things to note in this short story i think are worth sharing.

Antron Bach is a seller of Jedi antiquities. The new canon deals quite often with themes involving Jedi antiquities. In TFA, Aftermath,  Rebels and (most probably) Rogue One  just to name a few. It will be interesting to see if Antron is contacted by Luke at some point in future books / media.

Perhaps more interesting is that Antron was contacted by a survivor of Order 66 Master Uvell and entrusted with safekeeping a ship of jedi artifacts. The fate of this Master Uvell is not known. So there you have it, another Jedi survivor of order 66 who as far as we know, is not confirmed dead.

vs

    function fadeIn(el) {
      el.style.opacity = 0;

      var last = +new Date();
      var tick = function() {
        el.style.opacity = +el.style.opacity + (new Date() - last) / 400;
        last = +new Date();

        if (+el.style.opacity  1) {
          (window.requestAnimationFrame    requestAnimationFrame(tick)) || setTimeout(tick, 16);
        }
      };

      tick();

    fadeIn(el);

	<TEXT> Just lol at the description on github about trumpscript

"Our language includes several convenient features, perfect for any aspiring Presidential candidate including:

* No floating point numbers, only integers. America never does anything halfway.

* All numbers must be strictly greater than 1 million. The small stuff is inconsequential to us.

* There are no import statements allowed. All code has to be home-grown and American made.

* Instead of True and False, we have the keywords fact and lie.

* Only the most popular English words, Trump's favorite words, and current politician names can be used as variable names.

* Error messages are mostly quotes directly taken from Trump himself.

* All programs must end with America is great.

* Our language will automatically correct Forbes' $4.5B to $10B.

* In its raw form, TrumpScript is not compatible with Windows, because Trump isn't the type of guy to believe in PC.

* TrumpScript boycotts OS X and all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal.

* The language is completely case insensitive.

* If the running computer is from China, TrumpScript will not compile. We don't want them stealing our American technological secrets.

* By constructing a wall (providing the --Wall flag), TrumpScript will refuse to run on machines with Mexican locales
* Warns you if you have any Communists masquerading as legitimate "SSL Certificates" from China on your system.

* Won't run in root mode because America doesn't need your help being great. Trump is all we need.
* Easy to type with small hands"
