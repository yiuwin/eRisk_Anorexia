	<TEXT> I don't have the best money so the best i could do was get a Samsung KU6000 for 450. I have Horizon Zero Dawn and chose HDR in game but does it work best if HDR+ Mode is set as on in the TV settings or should i just leave that off? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not actually sure! I don't really do animation so I just went with what ever Photoshop had as default. Just had a quick look and I can't see anything obvious and the frames look [like this](http://i.imgur.com/mlNupyl.png). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The timing was a pure guess, first I made an "off" frame by taking out saturation on the sign and made the sign in the "on" frame brighter than the original by using blend mode "color dodge" and adjusting saturation until I was happy with the glow. For the animation I just duplicated the "on" image for 8 frames and then showed the "off" image for 1 frame. For the quicker flicker I went "on, on, on, off, on , off, on, on ,on" if that makes sense?

Basically it was something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/YN5LzzP.png). Green frames are the light on, red are off.

**Edit: Also there is a slight dimmer frame just after the first flicker which was an accident but looks better. To replicate that you could just turn down the opacity about 50% on the frame *after* it turns back on** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Long post but this happened to me 100% and I have no proper explanation for it**

----


**A little back story:** About 5 years ago myself and my uni friends decide to try a Ouija board, we weren't a weird group of goth kids chasing paranormal thrills or anything like that, we were just typical uni kids who liked to go out drinking. One of the girls who brought up Ouija boards in a convo and said she's done one before and knows how to welcome spirits and how to get them to leave etc, so we all spoke about it and thought fuck it, lets try one. I want to say I believe that they would never fake anything but I can't be 100% sure. Although there was something that happened that only I knew.

This is the only time I've ever had something like this happen that I can't explain.


**Night 1:**

The first time we tried there was about 5-6 of us set up in our uni living room and after a few minutes a little boy came through that said he used to live in the house. I think he did say a name but I can't remember it now, was something like "Daniel" so lets go with that, and he said he died in the early 1900's. I was a little skeptical about this at first because I thought that maybe the girl that suggested the whole Ouija board idea might have been playing up to it. We didn't do that for too long and we said goodbye to the spirit.

**Night 2:**

The next night we set it out again and this time there were different people and myself on the board. The original person who suggested it wasn't even in the house this night but the same kid, "Daniel" kid came back through. I think there was only myself and one other person from the first night on the board this time so if someone was faking I guess it had to be the one person. We ended that "chat" and it was just me with one other person who wasn't there the first night and then someone else came through, I can't remember if they said a name, it was a little unsure of what it was and when asked to leave the "chat", the glass we was using started to circle on the board faster and wider and nearly fell off the edge until it stopped. This was just me and one other girl who looked shocked as you could feel this thing pulling around. We stopped there.

**Night 3:**

On the third night I got a little brave and decided to try it in my uni bedroom. This time it was me and one guy with another girl spectating and straight away something came through that said its name was Richard and that it was over 3000 years old, it said it was neither male or female but that it didn't want to hurt us. After a few minutes of not really getting much out of it I decided to ask a personal question about a friend from home I had who died about 3 years prior. I said to "Richard", "how old was [friends name] when he passed away". Now, only I knew this as I never really spoke about it to my uni friends, especially his age. Some of them just knew I had an old friend who died. I'm also 100% that the guy I was on the board with didn't know his age as he was a friend of a uni friend too. But as soon as I asked, the glass moved to 1 then 9. He was 19 when he died and the guy I was on the board with just kinda looked at me like, "well, was he right?". That was the last time I tried the Ouija and I've had nothing weird happen since.

I'm very skeptical but like to keep an open mind but that night confirmed to me there must be something out there as there were too many things that happened to pin point it down to one person joking with us all.

I'm really tempted to try MH4U. Would it still be pretty active online? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never got a chance to try anything social on Monster Hunter as it all seemed too overwhelming and I sold it... How does the online work. Can I sort of join with random people to fight a monster or do I need to have them as a friend and invite them?

As my play times are infrequent it would be ideal for me to link up with randoms and go fight stuff. I feel that if I had to add people as a friend it might take a while for us to both be online at the same time to play. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would you recommend Shin Megami Tensei IV as a 3DS "Persona 5" in terms of mechanics? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-20 14:04:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm currently playing Persona 5 on the PS4 and my SO likes the look of it but she doesn't want to watch me playing it as she wants to play it after I finish it (which might take a while).

How similar are the games as I would love to buy my GF Shin Megami Tensei IV for her 3DS if it is anything like Persona 5.

I know they are both made by Atlus but I've just watched a quick video of the battling in Shin Megami Tensei IV and it seems to resemble Persona 5 a lot in terms of talking to the monster mid battle and asking them for things.

As far as I know Persona 5 focuses more on the school life/social aspect(?) apart from that how would you say they differ?

Also would Shin Megami Tensei IV be the best to play on the 3DS if you've never played one before?

**Thanks for the suggestions everyone. I think as I'm newish to JRPG's, SMT might be a bit too much for myself and my SO to get into just now. I will keep my eye on it for the future but I'm going to pass for now.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate to be that guy but I'm actually not that big of a fan of Mario Kart. I don't like the way the items work. The game essentially doesn't matter how well you drive but is more likely determined by the items you pick up.

	<TEXT> **Thanks for your help everyone, I've gone with Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.**

---------

I'm not on my 3DS everyday but I try a couple times a week after work. I know there is /r/3dsFCswap but what are people adding friends for exactly? I'd like to get more social with my 3DS as none of my friends have one.

I know this sounds stupid but I feel like you need to be online to play games at the same time as other players(?) and due to only being able to get on WiFi after work I feel its hard for me to be on when other people are.

~~Are there games that enable me to "interact" with other players online that don't have to be there at that present time? I think Animal Crossing is a bit like this when visiting their island? but I've had the game in the past and sadly I've lost interest in it.~~

**Edit: I should have explained my situation more clear. Basically I don't go online at all at the moment as I have nothing to do online that interests me but I'd like to get more frequent with something if I could play something with people.**

Can anyone recommend games I can get more social with? Even if it means chatting to a community on reddit.

I hope what I'm saying makes sense.

**TL;DR: I want to get more social with my 3DS but I don't have something to make me want to get online enough to play "live".** </TEXT>
