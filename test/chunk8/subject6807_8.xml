	<TEXT> I was obsessed and wrote to him as well!  I think I received a form letter and an early version of a comic he was releasing soon.  

It's weird that this particular comic as a kid always touched me, but as a dad now it speaks volumes to me about the priorities in my life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My son was trying out for a school play.  He practiced and practiced, even to the point of researching different acting methods.  When I picked him after tryouts I saw a lot of the kids crying.  He got in the car, and seemed very upbeat.

"You got a part?", I asked.

He smiled, "I sure did, I'm going to be in the crew and pull the curtain, and I'm going to do my best!"

I admire his courage in the face of disappointment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great post.  We went through similar things with my son trying to get him a proper IEP.  It took almost 2 years of fighting with the school district to make sure he wasn't denied the education that he deserves.  These fights are really important though because sometimes the more difficult and challenging you become, the greater the chance they'll change their policies and behavior to avoid it again in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't speak for the hateful things said, I haven't seen it much but maybe I'm just not seeing it.  But what you just said **"The murders were completely tragic and nothing can compare but at least the killer was killed and there is a resolution"** is part of the why I think everyone here gets so mad about it.  


This wasn't a lone wolf, 8 other people have been connected.  He was radicalized in prison, made previous threats, and acted in step with ISIS.  You're trying to treat this as some isolated lone wolf who just "murdered people".  We think there's an underlying problem that instead of addressing leftists tend to just stick their head in the sand and hope it goes away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where I lived we went on a survival camping trip for middle school. There was this bigger kid that a bit of loner and instead of pitching his tent with everyone else he went off by himself.  Some of the other guys teased him, but he seemed to handle it pretty well.

So anyways, he had brought some kebabs with him for the trip.  He was whistling to himself as he got them out.  Then he ran into a problem, he couldn't start his fire!  He tried over and over again but it wouldn't work. 

After one failed attempt, he started crying.  Middle school boys are not kind and really started laughing and mocking him.   I walked over to him and smiled when he looked up.  

"I'll start your fire for you on one condition, you share those kebabs!"

He smiled so huge, and the other boys came over and started to help gather some wood, get the fire going, and we shared all of our food together.

This was over 20 years ago and he's still a loner, but I'm still glad I showed him kindness. </TEXT>
