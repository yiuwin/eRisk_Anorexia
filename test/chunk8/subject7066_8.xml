	<TEXT> I bought mine years ago (before they were sold to Apple and on ebay so I got them for more than 50% off) when they first came out and I thought they sounded really good. I broke them a few months ago and was actually looking into purchasing some new headphones soon. 
What is something that you would recommend? I have been really interested in the sennheiser pxc 550 wireless headphones. Would love to hear some other thoughts on this. </TEXT>
