	<TITLE> Is there two movies titled "The Void" that recently came out? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am confused because I wanted to watch this movie called "The Void" but I am not sure if there is two different movies because I downloaded a movie called "The Void" and it is a anthology film and the one I wanted to see looks like an acutal movie. This is "The Void" that I want to see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-OknmEs9mY </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They couldn't have chosen better people to play the characters. My favorite characters are Jerome, Mooney, Nigma, Cobblepot. It was quite the joke though that Cobblepot had a bone for Nigma though, really?! I thought they were gonna do some sweet crimes together and then it turns out cobblepots gay for Nigma, pretty shitty. I do have much love for Barbara, James, Butch and Tigress as well though.  </TEXT>

I also ordered something from a third party seller that said they ship items out the next day, but they havent sent it out yet. Is it a possibility that they just couldn't update the shipping status due to the site? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that does make me feel better that I am not alone in this situation. I think it has something to do with someone not doing their job and updating things like they should be. One thing that is very confusing is everyvtime you message customer service you get a new person to look into your order so you keep getting different answers until the issue is solved finally. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Amazon needs to get there shit together. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-08 00:46:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was told my order was getting shipped today and It was never shipped so I got ahold of them and they told me sorry there was a misunderstanding with your order it will be shipped within 2-3 days.When I contacted them again asking why, they got back to me and said: "There was an unexpected delay in obtaining stock of item. I'm very sorry about that.
We now have stock of this item, and we're preparing your order for shipment. We'll send you an e-mail when your order ships." 

How did my order go from "Preparing to ship" to "Shipping today" to there was an unexpected delay in obtaining my item when there was 5 in stock according to amazon?. I already had this problem when ordering a dvd off of Amazon inc. It took them 4 or 5 days to ship my item and they ended up sending it with purolator so I couldnt even track my package and it took way longer to receive my dvd then it should have. They said "I'm very sorry about the delay in sending your order. While looking into this, I found a problem that was preventing your order from shipping. This is corrected now, and your order will be shipping soon."

Why can't they get a simple order right? Why does the website say something in stock and then when they go to ship it there is complications? It is very frustrating
