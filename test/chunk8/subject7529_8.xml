Rape is rape, no matter what, nobody deserves to live through that. Harry sounds like the worst kind of manipulator. It is great that you endured all that crap and found hapiness few years after, be proud. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As shaco you dont want to take so many kills, 3-4 should be more than enough for you to dominate the early-midgame, after that, you need to focus on getting your laners fed, protect them, ward for them, get the scuttle crab, and give them every single kill they can take.

You got a lead, but that gold advantage wasn't used to gain control of the map, next time try to invade the enemy jungle, be more agressive, to create pressure and make your teams life easier.

One of the best ways to do this is to camp the hell out of one lane (usually bot, to get your carry ahead and theirs behind), take tier 1 and 2 towers, and control the enemy jungle and dragon. This will slow down their farm and allow your team to kill them easier if they push, your team will also have an easier time grouping in other places of the map to get even more objectives.

Remember, after you get that lead, dont try to increase it, try to starve the enemy team and burn all their resources, get towers, dragons, herald (not for you, give it to your toplaner), make it so the enemy team is scared to walk in their own jungle, force them to think defensively to dissuade any push or agressive play, another great way to do this is to use blue/pink wards and shaco boxes in their jungle, the phsicologycal effect is devastating, they will feel oppresed and trapped. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We all talk about how good the level design, art, lore, bosses and so on are, how the game balances difficulty (git gud), and I agree, those are excellent, BUT, the thing that has most impressed me since I started my first run is the soundtrack. Its, fucking, brilliant.

Yesterday I fought Sif for the first time (rip doggo) and I can't stop listening to his theme.

Programmer: Hey Miyazaki! We just finished programming the boss! Its a cool wolf, and its big, and wields a greatsword, and its fast, and we even did that thing you told us where he is exhausted when his Hp is low. We were discussing that we could put some badass epic rock music to make the battle super exciting and...

Miyazaki: Violins

Programmer: What?

Miyazaki: Put violins, make a calmed and ominous theme, with some long silences.

Programmer: But a guitar solo...

Miyazaki: VIOLINS

You aren't a legenday knight that will save the princess from the evil dragon with his magic sword and silver armour. Just some random zombi, fighting a poor doggo that has been consumed by guilt long ago (Ye, I also finished the dlc yesterday, will talk about It in another post) and wants to have a warriors death to pay respect (press f) for his master. That violin gets me every single time.

WITHOUT spoilers, does the game do something similar with other fights? Making the battle anticlimatic in some other way? Because I fricking love It. Just answer yes or no please. Or "rip doggo" that one is fine too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert. 

Each character is a meticulous depiction of an aspect of society. It has some of the most interesting meta-narrative tricks I have ever seen in a book.

For example, in the first chapter, he describes a character in two-three lines, then uses a whole page to describe his goddam hat, and other people refer to him as "the guy with the hat", this tells you that he has no personality, that he is a dead weight that is unable to outstand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favourite advice for this is this phrase from George RR Martin: When you write a female character, think of her as a character, not a female.

Imagine you want to have a blonde character, is his/her whole personally defined by being blonde? No, he/she is a character who also happens to be blonde, and that might have some minor effect on how he/she thinks of him/herself and how others view them.

Same with a female character, she needs to have a well developed personality, interests, goals, fears... And to be a female, which may have some minor effect on the rest of her caracteristics, but never define her completely. </TEXT>

Do you have anyone you have a lot of confidance on? Family? Friends? Explain them how you feel, dont worry If you cant explain what it is that scares you or you cry, its normal when you are depressed. Just vent all this, you will feel better afterwars.

I'd like to cheer you up but you really seem to be feeling terrible about this. The best I can say is that its probably just a phase, and that when things cant seem to get worst, its because they are about to get better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there! I am a skeleton on his first Dark Souls playthrough, and I like to post my favourite experiences in the process of giting gud. I am doing a no-spoiler run so I would thank you if you try to keep them at a minimun.

Anyways, I am trying to find the Lord Souls, and have already encountered Seath in the Dukes Archives. As I was exploring the zone, I remembered that I still had the Crest of Artorias, and visiting the great knights tomb sounded like a good idea.

I went there, and of course fought Sif, but for the wrong reason, I... well, if you keep reading you will see what happened. I don't know if my interpretation of what happened is right, feel free to correct me in the comments, as long as it only involves minor lore spoilers.

.

I was staring at the bonfire. It always marvels me, such a small thing, yet so fierce, trying to fight back darkness and heat a world devoid of hope. With every second, my bruiser and cuts healed back, at the least the physical ones... for the others, those of the soul, I fear there is no cure, nor medical nor magic.

I had come to the Dukes Archives to search some information on where the former Lords of Lothran where hiding, but had only found death and monsters, some bestial, some human, and some none and both at the same time, pitiful beings created on who knows what forbidden rituales, probably performed by the broken mind of the Seath, the Last Dragon.

I stared at the deep forest in front of me, the trees dancing by the wind, taunting me to get lost into them. The balcony was high enough to let me see its dimensions, but low enough to see the ground, and diferentiate each tree, at least the closest ones. My attention wandered, and I remembered a certain crest hidden in the secret compartment in my bag, which was believed to be the key to the Tomb of Knight Artorias, the Abysswalker, the Wolf. The last time I had visited the Darkroot Forest I was seeking for guidance on my mission, but know that I knew my purpose, I was more calmed, but also resiliant, I felt that I had to pilgrinage and pay respect to the great knight.

I focused, and made a mental image of a bonfire, hidden inside a broken tower, surrounded by tall and ancient trees, dark as their curse, my spine shivered, and suddenly, I was there once again.

The door was still closed, and it shone with a pale light, as did the Crest as I removed it from my bag. There was a circular hole in the door, and something clicked when I inserted it and the light became a bit brighter, the door quaked, and began to slowly open. I had thought that the light would attract some of the demons hidden in the woods, but if there was any, they remained quiet. I wasn't sure if that was a good sign.

As I advanced, the trees started to merge together, forming a natural labyrinth, this was an older part of the forest, and also a wilder one. I felt observed by a pressence, something quiet but dangerous, yet nothing stepped in my way, so I continued.

In no time, I stumbled upon some ancient ruins, a testimony of some ancient civilazation that had tried to domesticate the forest, apperently with no sucess.

When I entered, a voice sharp as a knife filled the room:

-Is it not so that thou art new.

The speaker was the biggest cat I have ever seen, lying in a window. It kept talking.

-Thou fared well to find me. But cometh thee not for the grave of Sir Artorias? My advice true, forget this! Unless of course, thee are to join our guard.

-I fear that one could not prove himself worthy of such an honour. What is the task of such a noble order?

-Well indeed, thou art a strange one! Nevertheless, I feel some liking for thee. I'm Alvina of the Darkroot Wood. With Sif, partner of Artorias, I command a clan of hunters who track down defilers of the forest graves. What dost thou say? Wilt thou not join us? Oh yes, I believe we would suit thee well.

-To protect the memories of those fallen long ago? My sword and shield are yours.

-I am very glad! And now thou art one of us! Let us establish a Covenant. And here, thaketh this ring. If thou weareth that ring, it allows for thine summoning. If mine senses reveal intruders, then I will summon thee. Fend them off sir, I beseech only this.

Alvina's eyes followed me as I departed towards the hearth itself of the forest. Once I was gone, she whispered, low enough for nobody to hear her.

-I hope thee can doth for him what I never couldst

It could only be here. A clearing in the depths of the woods, the trees making place for the stars to shine, but none shone more than the moon, lighting the whole place.

Graves where scattered here and there, most where just rusted swords, but some had proper tombstones, with names of mighty knights, who fought evil and defended the innocent with their steel and hearth, all of them forgotten long ago, lost in the sea of history.

The tomb of Artorias was in the center, dominating the landscape, his greatsword rammed into the ground,a proof of the knights strenght and skill. I approached slowly, feeling the weight of my task diminish in comparison to Artoriase's burden, he wasn't called Abysswalker for no reason. A sudden growl woke me up from my daydream, I looked upwards, and was stunned with a terrifying vision; a gray wol, big beyond reason. My gut told me it was no warning, but a challenge. The beast leaped, holding the greatsword with his teeth and unearthed it, then adopted an offensive dueling pose, I rose my guard on reflect.

The strikes where like lightning, a blurry of gray fur and steel, hitting me tirelessly. I managed to block it without many problems, for some reason, the pattern was familiar to me, similar to the style of the silver knights of Anor Londo.

The animal flexed his legs, and I guessed it would try to get my back jumping over me. The movement was a fraction too slow and I managed to connect a slash, hitting the front left leg and spilling his blood all over the ground and making him stumble uppon landing, it wasn't a deep cut, but blood was pouring out, making it's fur turn red. The wolf stopped for a moment, just staring at me, if it hadn't been a wild animal, I would have thought that it was studying me. The next attack was a stab which I dodged to the right with the intend of hurting the other leg, the stab, however, wasn't so, but a feint, followed by a slash to the right, the blow was so powerful that it send me flying, ten meters away, as I rolled to minimize harm, I lost grip of my shield and my sword, luckyly, my armour had protected me well. I recomposed as fast as I could, expecting a follow up, but the wolf hadn't moved from his prior position and had simply stood there, waiting. I picked up my weapons, and made an attack pose, the wolf did the same.

This time, I was the one charging, the animal rose the greatsword, but I guessed it would try to scratch me with it's good leg, I was right, and as I quickly made a step backwards I landed by second attack. Now that both legs where hurt, the wolf's movement would be severly impaired, and it's attacks limited to his sword and teeth.

I easily dodged the next hit and counterattacked with a stab that hurth it's left shoulder. The exhaustion of the battle and the lost of blood were adding up, making each attack more predictable than the former, and limiting it's defending posibilities. But the wolf didn't turn back, refusing to surrender. I stopped for a moment, why was this Wolf so fierce? Where had an animal learned to wield a weapon with such a technique? Only then I remembered where we were fighting, and the full title of the knight. Sir Artorias, The Abysswalker, The Wolf. Could it be? How was such a thing possible?

I looked at his eyes with mine, he looked back, and seemed to understand my question without me saying a single word. I approached him, and caressed him below his last wound, where his fur was all wet in blood.

-Artorias?

He answered with his sword, this time, his hit was weaker, and only send me five meters away, yet I still managed to lose my sword.

We stood up at the same time, yet not with the same effort, as he was clearly using his last breath. Was this wolf Artorias? No. The knight was dead for good, it made no sense... who...? And then, it clicked, and I understood what the purpose of this battle was.

-Sif

The wolf growled, and looked at my sword, he adopted his attack pose for a third time.

-Artorias lived up to his legend, didn't he? Well, I cannot say no to another warriors petition. Are you sure?

Sif pointed at my sword once again.

-So be it.

I prepared myself for the last assault, Sif charged, somehow overcoming his pain. I rose my shield high, knowing his true intend, at the very last second, he lowered the sword to follow with an upper slash which would break my guard, but I was ready and jumped backwards, now he was defenseless, stading on his back feet, as he had helped his final hit with all of his body, I quickly stabbed his hearth, instead of falling on me, Sif made a last effort and fell to the right, a loyal warrior until the very end. When I surrounded his body to look at its face, it was already too late, the wolf had passed away.

-I shall not forget your greatness, knight Artorias, and you'd be proud to know that your partner waited long enough to meet with you in honorable death.

I looked again at the tomstone, only to find a corpse that I hadn't seen before. In it's hand I found two rings, one of them had a little blue gem, the other one an emblem of a Hornet, how curious... </TEXT>

The bosses where you have to follow a procces, like a puzzle (Pounder, Prophet, Crew) are surprisingly not repetitive for me. Why? 

-Meh, this boss is so easy and boring, just kill the match...

The writer managed to create some of the most scary robots I have ever seen. Not your usual Terminator, but more like animal based robots. Kamikaze bots which follow ant's exploration patterns, "bullet" bots shot by snipers which enter your body and kill you from the inside... The kind of thing a real AI could create. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, a free tp with no counterplay early in the game (just put It under tower). And some free stats, which he desperately needs.

Why?

How do the portals fit into his thematic? I am not talking about the lore. Why should a juggernaut have such an ability? Nothing in his kit makes him a good ganker or splitpusher (unless extremely fed), so whats the point? Mordekaiser right now is a Lane bully who transitions into a big teamfight treat that needs to be stopped with cc, and has insane objectives control with his ghosts, any tweak before a properly VGU should be aimed in that direction </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ye, I realiced on my own. When I went to the first level after the tutorial I died so many times that I kind of gave up and began to explore the tower, I found the minigame and somehow I climbed half of It, so I have It another try, and another, and another, and...

After half an hour later I realiced that I was fighting enemies and obstacles from all the areas from shovel Knight, and when I finally made It, I went to the flying machine, knowing It would be one of the hardest levels, I cut through It like butter. </TEXT>
