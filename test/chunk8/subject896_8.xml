	<TEXT> I have a distinct memory of a doctor (I remember the white coat) telling me as a very young child, that I was allergic to bears. I would say it as a kid and my mom just thought it was just a funny thing I'd say, not that I genuinely believed it. It probably wasn't until late elementary or early middle school that I brought it up again and my mom stopped to ask if I was serious. 

The best I can work out is that I dreamed it when I was very young or a doctor had said it jokingly and for some reason it had stuck with me. I'm usually the butt of a lot of bear jokes in my family now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, why the flying saucer? I'm not sure why it was in the story. I feel like if it was taken out, we wouldn't miss anything. It didn't add to the story other than make me wonder where they were going with it... Maybe we'll see more in season 3? Other than that, I really enjoyed this season!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sounds like yours will be easier to remove if you do go for it. I don't know why more doctors and dentists don't take the time to properly explain things to their patients. The periodontist (specialty dentist) I work for always takes the time to fully explain their situation, their options, pros/cons, costs. Educating makes for better case acceptance anyway. 

Never hesitate to ask your dentist more about it. I'm sure he could give you some good facts and statistics.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It CAN lead to problems. Not always, but it can for some. The reason dentists recommend getting your 3rd molars removed while you're 17-22ish is because the root of the tooth can eventually grow to wrap around a nerve that runs through your jawbone. Once the tooth is wrapped around that nerve removal becomes very difficult. Some 3rd molars will lead to abscesses (a little pocket full of puss) that will slowly eat away at the bone around the tooth, effecting other healthy teeth and bone. This is not the case with everyone though. But it's a good preventative measure against future problems. Just because you don't currently have any problems with them doesn't mean it will always be that way. Sounds like your dentist is trying to get them out now while you're healthy and have no problems with them. 

If you do it, good luck. I had 4 impacted (meaning they hadn't ruptured through the gum) wisdom teeth (just like this gif). I was heavily sedated by an anesthesiologist, but wasnt "put under" fully. I had no problems, don't remember the surgery and the next few days were a bit rough but within a week I was back to normal. I'm glad I got it done and over with. The oral surgeon was established and did really nice work.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hullo all! Had a question about large animals. We have a druid in our party with a large lion companion. The lion does some real damage and our party relies on him for such, however, since he has leveled up and grown from a medium animal to a large animal, he now has difficulty fitting into spaces we fight in. He can squeeze but that can be very tricky. Is there any spell/item/etc that could help him fit without taking the hits when squeezing? We're currently running Curse of the Crimson Throne and we use CRB only.

I'd appreciate any tips you can throw our way! We need that lion! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I told him that I knew. He still denied it and refused to sign a HIPPA form to so his doctors could tell me. 

He is also a sociopath, so the fact that he put me and my younger sister at risk is pretty usual for him. 

Being a sociopath, he was always a womanizer. But when his wealth ran out and his wives left, I'm sure he turned to less conventional means of finding a woman. Or man, maybe. Or 'chicks with dicks' as I innocently found on our house computer several times. He also spent all of his money opening a whore house/ bar in Juarez, Mexico for a couple of years. There really is no telling when he was exposed to it. Countless times.

He may have been HIV+ for a good while now. No way of knowing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently found out my father is HIV+ after the hospital found a tumor in his colon and diagnosed it as Burkitts Lymphoma, a lymphoma that is mainly found in HIV+ patients. He knowingly put me at risk and consistently lied about it for his own selfish purposes. I found out because I overheard a nurse at the hospital telling him that they were going to 'double up his HIV meds' while I had just arrived outside the room. He still hasn't admitted it to me. Instead he denies it, knowing that I have been cleaning up his blood and feces for months now. I recently got tested and everything came back clear. I am very very thankful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I pride myself on getting all of these pictures labeled properly. I always hate looking though other's albums of 300+ pics and none of them are labeled. It was a lot of work. Not only did I dress up for 2 of the days, but I took a ton of pictures, edited them, uploaded them, and have spent the week labeling them. A lot of work went into it, so I'm glad so many of you are appreciating it. Makes it all worthwhile! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't tend to ask most people who their characters are. It's so crowded I'm lucky to get the shot without causing traffic or having someone walk in front of the camera. Also, I tend to know who most of them are, and if I don't telling me some weird name that I'll never remember isn't very helpful. That's why I rely on the good people of Reddit to help me NAME! THAT!

	<TEXT> Thanks! Meeting him was a 3 second ordeal. I had a whole thing prepared. I was going to thank him for coming all the way down to Texas just to get his picture with me, Captain Mal. Then we were going to make [this face](http://imgur.com/15EddJV) together. I barely managed to smile and thank him before being shouted at to get out of the way and go pick up my picture. :-( But it was nice to finally get a pic with him. I can scratch it off my list! </TEXT>
