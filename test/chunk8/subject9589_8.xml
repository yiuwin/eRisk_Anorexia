	<TEXT> **Bob Log III**
   He's a one man band that built his own head gear to distort his voice by stealing payphones and attaching it to a custom built helmet. His music is described as a blues punk guitar dance party. Seriously guys, he's [awesome](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/img/music/boglog/28.jpg).
He's been around since the late nineties and he was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona. So without further ado here's some swanky tunes for y'all. 

[Ooh Ah Ooh Uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQmX4LzaDDU) 

[Track 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM28_JYZoLE)

[Riverside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJO6ZZuUhQ)

[I Want Your Shit On My Leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ico7nXBGhw) Takes girls from the audience and places with them bouncing on his knee. Fun bit.

There's plenty more where that came from. Enjoy everyone.

	<TEXT> I may be a little late but Frasier got pretty dark after 9/11. Kelsey Grammar already had struggled with many family deaths and alcohol/drug abuse. One of his producers, who happened to be a pretty close friend was on board one of the planes that hit the towers. The show became a lot more serious after that even while maintaining a sitcom mentality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey! You're that guy from those beer commercials aren't you??!! Can you do it once for us please?!?!!

On a serious note Party Down is one of the best shows I've ever seen on television and I wish we could have had more than two seasons. What was your favorite moment during that show to shoot? Also have there been any discussions about it ever returning or is it left to the history books? 

p.s. Thanks for being such an awesome cat / mega stud.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't expect you to understand how hard it was dealing with something like this. It's a condition that doesn't have a lot of light shed on it and for you maybe cats and ameristralia are front page worthy but I believe if I can inspire others who are experiencing the same thing. Yes, there are those who pull out their entire head of hair, sorry it my life's life changing event pissed you off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way you describe the feeling sounds similar to the way it makes me feel. Might be trich. Catch yourself doing it so you try to become more aware and it becomes less of a compulsive behavior. You can do it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's never too late, there's always time to beat it no matter what kind of damage has been done. I still have some skin picking issues with acne on my back but ultimately I know if I continue to do it, it will never even begin to heal. Positivity, again anyone who would want someone to talk to I can be there even if it's just to talk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your daughter is very fortunate to have such understanding and helpful friends, along with loving and supportive parents. It's people like you that remind me to remain optimistic. I'm glad she has overcome the hardest part, once they are back she will no doubt feel powerful, strong, and confident. Thank you for your kind words, Reddit blows me away sometimes.  </TEXT>
