	<TEXT> I actually eat wholegrain bread literally all the time. So far I've not had issues with it but some people are sensitive to gluten. Also I eat a lot of oats, veggies, rice, eggs, beans, nuts and seeds, low-fat cottage cheese / curd cheese, etc (I'm vegetarian). You have to find a style of eating that is sustainable for you. I prepare my own food for school days (rice with beans, broccoli and eggs) but that might not be doable for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the tips! That tip about pulling the elbows actually made a huge difference in terms of upper back tightness.

	<TEXT> Yeah it's so easy for me to overtrain lol. When I set up a mesocycle I always plan to only go to failure in my last week before the deload but then the first training session I do goes BAM! failure on the first set of the first exercise. This mindset is a blessing on one hand and a curse on the other hand. I feel like I would have made better progress and maybe even better health if I'd take it a little easier.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bedankt voor het advies. Ik ben gelukkig al een stuk aardiger voor mezelf geworden en dat heeft absoluut geholpen. De gemeenschap waar ik in ben opgegroeid is wellicht een tikkeltje bekrompen en narrow-minded, en ik denk ook wel dat dat een rol heeft gespeeld. En ik zal zeker mijn moeder gaan verwennen! :) Nogmaals bedankt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I got tested at the hospital and my doctor who is specialized in eating disorders told me that my testosterone levels are too low for my age. She told me that this was normal as I have been underfed for an extended period of time but that it should catch up if I continued eating enough. I sure as hell will continue eating a lot. However, losing my abs is something that seems really hard for me right now. I now that having a higher bf will probably speed up the growth... but... yeah. You got me. I make sure I sleep 9 hours a night btw :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I see what you mean. I think the lighting was weird and the camera of my phone sometimes seems to put a filter over a picture.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! When I just got out of the hospital I did get 'fat' because I had lost all of my muscle mass before and then had to eat a lot while lying in a bed whole the time. I then lost that fat again however :(  </TEXT>
