As much criticism as there has been on here, there's been just as many apologist threads for him and people saying how much they love him.

	<TEXT> I completely agree with the first bit and I think it's why seasons like Cambodia, MvGX, and now this one are somewhat dull. The thing about strategy is that there's only so much new strategy you can watch that is exciting and fresh. After 34 seasons of it, it gets old. So if the season is focused on only strategy or all the players care about is playing a highly strategic game, it becomes boring to watch because you're essentially just watching 10 people decide what alliance they want to be in and play some idols.

What makes Survivor interesting is the personal drama and the social dynamics, and that's something that is sorely lacking when all of the players view it only as a strategic game that they want to win no matter the cost. </TEXT>

When you're in as crazy of a situation as Survivor, you look for any sort of comfort, including emotional comfort, possible. Having a shared history with someone like that, and having had that person in your life for the past three months, even just in the periphery, when everything else is changing and is constantly uneasy and paranoid, has to be comforting, and so it's understandable when that comfort is stripped to be emotional. </TEXT>
