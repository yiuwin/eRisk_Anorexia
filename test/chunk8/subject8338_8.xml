	<TEXT> It's actually the opposite for me. Every time I've listened to music on DXM it's just sounded flat, boring, and actually worse than it did when I was sober. For some reason, when I listen to music on heavier benzodiazepines (Ativan, etc.) it all sounds huge, epic, and sometimes scary, no matter what the song. These are all just my experiences though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These are all the albums that I have listened to all the way through that I consider "perfect." Please don't down vote just because you don't like an artist.

KANYE WEST - MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY

This is the album that really got me in to hip-hop. Kanye is probably one of the best mainstream producers out there today and it really shows here. Every song is unique and the featured artists all sound amazing. Hell, Nicki Minaj even KILLS her verse on Monster.


BLINK 182 - BLINK 182 (Self Titled)

Reddit doesn't seem to like these guys very much but they're one of my all time favorite bands. This album, in my opinion, was when they were at their musical best. Right in between their Punk/Pop Punk phase (Cheshire Cat, Dude Ranch etc.) and their Alternative/Space Rock phase (Neighborhoods, Dogs Eating Dogs.) This was the first album that I listened to all the way through and I loved every song, there's just so much energy.


TOOL - LATERALUS

This album is simply a work of art. The complex time signatures and mystic lyrics force you to listen to the album closely and appreciate every bit of it. All the songs flow together perfectly and leave you feeling chilled and paranoid by the end (Faaip de Ohaid, I'm looking at you.) Probably Tool's magnum opus.


TYLER THE CREATOR'S TRILOGY (BASTARD, GOBLIN AND WOLF)

Despite having a REALLY shitty, rabid, 13 year old, fan base, Tyler crafts one of the most interesting and comprehensive concept albums of the past few years. Sure his flow can be weird, and the lyrics can be a bit over the top at times, but listening close enough to find the actually story (don't want to spoil anything) has made me really appreciate these albums.

MARILYN MANSON - ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR

Possibly one of the angriest and most nihilistic albums ever made, this one is really worth a listen, no matter how heavy it gets at times. Most people dismiss this band as some sort of dumb shock rock group, but they really aren't (or at least weren't during this era.) Manson's lyrics address everything that is wrong with society. Materialism, conformity, prejudice, and much more. Once you get past their image, they become a great band, this album in particular. </TEXT>
