	<TEXT> I woke up not too long ago (I didn't sleep worth crap) and he had come home early cause he's having cramps and diarrhea. I've disinfected literally everything with Clorox bleach, changed the towels in the bathroom, and made him some chicken noodle soup with toast cause he said he's hungry. So we'll see how everything goes. My mom is feeling just fine so there's that. But like I said, he has IBS and this has happened before, but I'm not taking any chances. Your comment actually made me feel a lot better though, he didn't have diarrhea until this morning so I think I've eliminated any risk. At least I really hope so.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anxiety through the roof... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Ugh, sorry in advance if this is a bit long. Its 4:18am and I'm freaking out.
So, I can never sleep and usually just lay in bed watching Netflix or playing on my phone. Occasionally, my fiance wakes up to ask what I'm doing or if I'm alright, and tonight he woke up, rolled over and said "Ugh these cramps..." Instantly I was like "What cramps?" and he pointed to his stomach and I immediately felt my heart drop and my anxiety kick in. I asked him if he was nauseous and he said a little, so I instantly got out of bed and have been pacing and panicking for close to half an hour now. 
To my knowledge, we haven't been around anyone who has been ill and he did have Mexican food and sushi this weekend, sooo...food poisoning is a possibility but you know what I'm terrified of - that its something contagious.
Im being tested for lupus and other autoimmune diseases, so its incredibly hard for me to tell if I've caught something or if its just a bad day for me. I run low-grade fevers for no good reason, have no appetite, my body hurts, and it feels like the flu. It comes and goes every couple of days, so I'm scared to catch even a cold right now. I have no idea how my body will react. 
We live in a one bedroom apartment, we're always kissing and hugging, sharing germs, etc. So if he DOES have something, I'm screwed. Plain and simple. 
He does occasionally have IBS attacks during the night sometimes, so maybe that's the case, but I don't know since he just fell back asleep after he said he was a little nauseous.
Im trying my hardest to distract myself, but I'm so anxious and scared that I'm making myself feel sick. I've already taken an anti-emetic so hopefully it helps. I can't even lay in bed so I'm sitting out in the living room, praying to god he sleeps until 7:30, wakes up, and is fine. 
Ugh, so much for getting any sleep. I just want to cry :(  </TEXT>

Like I said, I do the same exact thing and I know its a hard habit to break but your stomach gets so used to NO food that sometimes even one bite of something is overwhelming.

Next time just take it slow and try not to eat so much at once :) As for tonight, try choosing something kind of light. Considering the past couple days, your tummy might need some rest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Google can be your worst enemy lol In my experience, being hospitalized so many times, tons of different doctors talking to me, if you had an ulcer or crohns or anything like that you would most definitely know. My mom has diverticulitis and colitis, and has also had ulcers, so here's what I've learned from taking care of her: 
With an ulcer you would have some pretty bad burning and stomach pain, and also it would probably make you v* if it got too bad. My mom had them and she said it hurts ways more than just a stomach ache and the burning is horrible. 
With crohns/colitis/diverticulitis, the abdominal pain is unbearable, along with severe diarrhea pretty much day in and day out. My mom almost had to have a blood transfusion during an episode because she lost so much in her bowel movements. If you had a severe bowel disease, it would make itself known and there wouldn't be any question about it :) 
If going to a doctor and maybe being talking to them or getting tested for certain things (since they run in your family) would ease your mind a bit, then there's nothing wrong with that. I know some things can be pretty much avoided or controlled with diet so maybe eating a little healthier would help you out in the long run :) 
Bottom line is, if you had a disease or condition, you would definitely know as it would make itself known. I hope I shed a little light on this for you, I've been in that position too many times :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was eating just a little while ago and kind of noticed something odd. I only eat very small bites of food and freak out if I'm not able to cut something on my plate up. I realized I feel safer for some reason if I eat smaller bites of food, as maybe big bites or bites not chewed well enough will be too much for my stomach or make me sick. 
It was kind of a weird moment for me, as I never realized it or processed it before. I just wondered if I'm really weird or the only one who does this? Its not like its a problem, seems more like a quirk than anything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you :) I'm just so scared and frustrated and its manifests itself in a crappy ways. It took me months of begging to get a referral to an Endo for a second opinion, so thats my next step. I guess I was just wondering what other peoples experiences with this were and how they handled it. I've asked for a biopsy but they refused, so I'm hoping they can for sure tell just by an ultrasound that everything's benign.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only called them idiots because I'm upset and frustrated, they literally laugh at me in the office. I voice my concerns and they tell me its just anxiety. I'm scared because I have nodules growing at a substantial rate in my neck and they will not take the time to explain anything to me or barely even explain test results. I end up reading the reports myself. I had to beg to get a referral to an Endo (cause every Endo around my area will not see you without a referral) and they finally gave me one. I've been sick for over a year and things kind of keep progressing but I keep getting brushed off. I didn't mean to sound rude or ungrateful to them, but I'm frustrated. I am getting a second opinion from the Endo in August but I just have nowhere else to go and no one to ask advice from about this, I have no idea what to expect especially if it is cancer.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Has anyone tried Colestipol? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-01 00:43:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all, sorry in advance for the wall of text.
A little history; I'm 23 years and I've had IBS since my Dad died when I was ten. I also developed severe anxiety, which does not help as we all know. Throughout the years I've cycled between C and D, right now its almost a mixture of both. I've tried levysin (sp?), bentyl, various pain killers, and they seem to help for a while then just stop working altogether. I deal with constant bloating, gas, gurgling, almost non-stop stomach pains and cramps, nausea, and completely watery stools. I can't pinpoint any certain trigger foods, except for the fact I'm lactose intolerant so I avoid dairy like the plague. All I drink is water, no soda or tea for over a year now. 
I've been dealing with a thyroid condition, a heart condition, and endometriosis for over a year now. Endo has been around since I was 15 though. I had my gallbladder out two years ago and ever since then, I feel like it has exacerbated my IBS. Most days even just a glass of water gives me diarrhea. I've tried benefiber with the only success being that I became constipated. So, I had a stool sample (for anything and everything they can test it for), blood work, CT scans, x-rays, all showing absolutely nothing. Therefore, they will not give me a referral to a gastroenterologist. I had to fight tooth and nail just to get a referral to an endocrinologist, even though I have multiple growing nodules on my thyroid. So, I was prescribed Colestipol and they've chalked my symptoms up to a lack of a gallbladder. 
Has anyone else dealt with worsening IBS issues after having their gallbladder removed or tried Colestipol? I'm at the end of my rope here and I'm about to shell out close to $100 for this prescription. Thanks in advance for any insight or advice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The mind is powerful, unfortunately. I know when I get abdominal cramps my mind races to my worst fear and makes me feel 100x worse. If you've been having cramps and stuff since the 18th, you may have eaten something that didn't sit right with you and I was always told to just let the diarrhea run its course (unless of course it lasts for days and/or you become dehydrated, then get to an ER) and let your body get rid of it. Maybe try eating light stuff like the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) and stick to water. Give your tummy time to settle. Sipping on ginger ale or sprite always helps me too. But keep trying to eat! At least a piece of toast or something. It will help immensely. Also, try keeping yourself as distracted as possible. It really does help when you're super anxious. I hope you feel better soon, I'm sure this will run its course very soon and you'll be over it :)  </TEXT>

You're doing good by keeping yourself distracted (OITNB kept me super distracted a couple weeks ago when I wasn't feeling well :) ) Just keep sipping on water when you can and always try to eat at least a little bit of something.
