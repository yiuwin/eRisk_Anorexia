Oooh that's tricky

Probably Thanos.

The Infinity Gauntlet is too strong, the equation wouldn't work because Thanos would bend reality to his whim.

The skull masks in Cinco De Mayo fit better with Bane than the Black Mask.

If Roman, a white character - is given a Cinco De Mayo mask.....everyone will cry "appropriation". Causing further DCEU controversy...

[Furthermore, the mask Roman wears don't look anything like Hispanic masks](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=skull+masks+during+cinco+de+mayo. source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0ahUKEwjB_se68bLSAhVDlZQKHQi2At0Q_AUICCgB biw=1097 bih=543) </TEXT>

I have this weird sinking feeling he's going to give Roman a tattoo of a mask on his face or make the mask a part of his face.

The great thing about Black Mask is that he's anti Batman.

He's an incredibly rich man who dons a mask to be THE crime lord of Gotham.

- The mask doesn't hide some weird facial disfigurement.

- The mask was not melted on his face.

It's so simple, but Ayer's "LA gang" sensibilities do worry me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Don't shave your ass! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-27 15:51:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble s**ting.

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regular problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that they were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my cheeks. It led to so much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butt hair dwelling. 

Eventually I would have to do two things, either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover faecal matter before the toilet paper reached it's *"Can't Be Flushed"* threshold.

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. 

HEY! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my logs will flow out like beer from a keg! It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. 

"How many Indians could there be?" said General Custer. 

"Looks like a good day for a drive!" said JFK. 

"There, America Online now has complete Usenet access!" said by some idiot system technician. 

Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the ravine in between began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair.

 My ass was smooth as ivory. 

I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know.....

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. 

For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two ass cheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic brownie molecules lingering around my chocolate starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky sweat combination. 

As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. GOD-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of fire ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

This exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. 

Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odour mixed with the tangy smell of my own s**t blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: 

Will be like this until the hair grows back? 

Later on, trying to deal with it as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. 

I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my ass cheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. 

Imagine your ass having the texture of a Brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.



**Friends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS HAIR!**

	<TEXT> Did I claim they were? Read my statement again.

All I meant was that it's unlikely an actor/actress who played a big role in the MCU would get a job at the DCEU.

And, likewise, Sam Rockwell did fuck-all in that Iron Man movie.

He was **literally** the main villain of the movie.

Callan had a small part in Winter soldier.

TDK wasn't a CGI fest. Are you saying TDK has the same scale as ARGO?

Oh no, TDK has far more practical stunts and CGI than Argo, but with a good team - it wouldn't be that different to making a film like Argo.

Maybe that's exactly what he's doing. He's getting help from reeves.

I'm actually very excited for Reeves.

	<TEXT> Justin Kroll is a movie reporter from Variety who gets paid to call studios and agencies to break scoops.

Exactly, he's solely focused on scoops.

John Campea is just a guy who rants on them. 

How is delivering the news "ranting".

Do you call shows like John Oliver and Stephen Colbert's "ranting"?

If Campea wants to be a scooper then he should join or create a trade site and post them there instead of saying whatever just for clickbait sites to run with them as legit sources.

You're acting as if he "scoops" constantly.

Furthermore, there was absolutely no clickbait.

The title of the video was "New Batman Director In Talks - Collider Movie Talk".

Where does it say, "Affleck might LEAVE" or anything to that effect.

It's us, the fans that make these things popular.

The video only has 155,000 views and the Batman talk is roughly 15-20 percent of the video.....but people only focused on what he said.

I seriously don't understand, how can you blame someone who specifically asked people not to take his word for it and that all his scoops were wrong before? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's where you're wrong kiddo, they're not "reporters". They're bloggers who share their opinion on movie related news.

The definition of a "reporter" is;

*"A person who reports, especially one employed to report news or conduct interviews for the press or broadcasting media."*

There used to be a time reporters and bloggers were two different occupations....but that is no longer the case.

The term "blogger" is all but extinct, with almost all news articles being online.

Even traditional Newspapers have gone online. 

They have no legit sources, they even say so themselves that they don't break scoops. So why she would listen 

Collider discuss Movie News.



I don't think it's such a stretch for someone like Campea to hear something and want to share it with his audience.

 You can't say that you don't break scoops then say "I heard...." doesn't work like that.

In his entire career as a movie reporter, he has broken only three scoops....two that were outright false and one that's unproven.

Even then, he constantly tells people to take it with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will, however, say you have a lot of good will if you choose to read it the way you do despite knowing the history of this guy and his cohorts, as it relates to news and opinions.

Steven Weintraub wrote an article for why he thought Affleck would leave, after seeing the Kimmel interview and he was ridiculed.



If Campea thinks the Reeves/WB relationship will break down in the near future...there are only two results.

A - It happens, meaning Campea was right.

B - It doesn't - meaning Campea is wrong.

In the meantime, could you please stop shitting on someone else because their opinions don't fit your narrative. 

This guy has given me no reason to believe he's saying "Be cautious" as opposed to "Affleck's a liar and I'm right." 

You're acting as if Affleck is in charge of his own twitter and not his assistant and a group at WB focused on social media.

If a nun tells you "Be proud of your heritage," it has a wildly different context than if a Nazi told you "Be proud of your heritage". Same applies here.

The context might be different, but the meaning is the same.

Did you forget Famuyiwa and his exciting posts of Flash related content?

He left the Flash due to disagreements.....are you saying there's absolutely no chance of it happening again?

I think you misunderstood what I said so I'll repeat it.

- The sub, as a general entity hates certain reporters....ofcourse, every person has their own opinions.

- One of these so called "hated" reporters says something controversial.

- The majority laugh, while a minority feel there's some merit.

- The news becomes a reality.

- The sub as a collective goes through this weird positive purge where every post is about "why _ is actually good".

- The sub goes back to hating the reporters, even the ones who were right all along....and the cycle continues.

So yes - I guess in a way it is consistent.

	<TEXT> Someone who has never directed or acted in a movie in his life, he has a massive fucking ego.

I've met the guy and he was one of the most humble guys I have seen.

He keeps saying that why is he backing out from a directing+acting job when he already did the same in gone girl?

Gone Girl was directed by Fincher, not Affleck.

Well maybe he thought the same thing but during script and pre-production realized how massive the movie will be and how difficult it be to act as batman and direct action scenes etc.

Are you saying he wasn't aware of this when he signed up?

In my opinion, he decided not to direct so he can avoid ruining his name if it didn't come out right. Live By Night was supposed to come out at the end of **this year** but was rushed by WB.

I think the ratings and reviews got to him, and he realised it would be very hard to make a good movie while WB is choking you.



If he really thinks that Batman and Gone Girl have same scale then he's really an idiot

With enough time and help, directing a movie like Argo is not all that different from the Batman movie.

Batman doesn't have to be a CGI fest and could be a really good crime film....like The Town.

Again, he didn't direct Gone Girl.

And each time he asked viewers to not take his word for it.

I don't know I can't see the future or parallel universes.

It's a simple case of cause and effect.

Affleck said something on national TV and it didn't pan out....making what he says less trustworthy.

TBH he's just a failed director who couldn't really accomplish anything in his life so he does his weekly rants in front of the camera.

He's done far more in the movie business than you and I.

I don't even understand where this hatred is coming from....

 then it's also our job to let him know when he fucks up.

I think everyone would be over the moon right now if WB had not allowed Affleck to go on Kimmel and say he was directing, only to renege after 10 days. 

Now, anything Affleck or WB says is taken with a grain of salt.

And besides, a person whole sole job is to critique someone else's work

In my opinion, the Nightwing movie is a sign that Affleck might not be in the DCEU for long. 

This sub goes through a cycle of hating on reporters when they release a rumour/story, then get overly positive when the negative rumour/story becomes true....and then back to hating the same reporters all over again.

	<TEXT> Many times when I'm reading a Superman comic, he does things that make me think, if Snyder puts this same scene in a movie he would get crucified.

Are we talking about specific instances, or their general modus operandi?

Every hero in a comic book/movie has had moments where they act in a way the're not proud of (unlike their usual character)....but it's not their normal way of doing things.

I have read some stories where Superman was extremely angry with a villain and did hurt them...but it's not his normal MO.



Furthermore, a comic book has the luxury a movie hasn't....so a comic book can do something that doesn't work in a film and vice versa.

Brutalized? Really? Not only you don't read Superman comics, but you didn't see BvS either.

Apologies Highfather, it seems you know me better than even myself

	<TEXT>  The way bruce and thee government see it superman is a walking nuke with emotions and feelings, so basically the entire human race is at his mercy if he had a bad day because no one can stop him. 

I agree...infact, I've said the exact same thing numerous times.

However, wouldn't Batman try to investigate Superman?

The government has nowhere near the power of Bruce Wayne and his multi-Billion dollar international empire. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> but people don't know Grodd, wouldn't they need a movie to get introduced to a villain?

Appreciate the sarcasm, but a villain never needs a solo movie....but a main hero does.

If a villain has his own movie....he/she becomes an anti-hero.

A solo movie for the hero makes it easier for the audience to understand them and also makes the sequel far more simple for the Director. Rather than focusing on **who** they are, they could explore **what** they are.

It's not always necessary, but it creates a far more in depth character as a result. However, this is only the case for cinematic universes where the hero is a recurring character.





For a stand alone movie, there is no need for an introduction (for both the villain and the hero/protagonist). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  kinda just turn off my head for somethings when I enjoy it. Think we are all overthinking every little detail.

That's fine, every movie has it's faults and fallacies.

Couldn't it be that Lex "gave" away this information. Since Batman is looking for the Portuguese or whatever. I always got the impression that Lex is feeding him with everything.

Yes, Lex did allow him access to the Metahuman files......but it didn't have any vital info on Clark/Superman.

The only info he got from Lex was the Kryptonite's whereabouts. </TEXT>

There's a difference between bullying and reprimanding.

Bullying is the type of justice Batman employs...Superman never brutalises an enemy/criminal.

	<TEXT> Yea so a guy kills thousand of his employees and this guy wants to become friend.

What?

The BZ Event happened while the stock market was closed, meaning the employees who died were in the 30-40 mark.

this guy creates an international incident where 50-100 people are burnt by lasers
and Bruce wayne wants to be friend with the guy

Who said I want Bruce to be Superman's friend?

I clearly said **acquaintance**.

Is a spy contacting the enemy and befriending him/her with an ulterior motive friendship?

All I said is that Bruce could've used his power and money to find a way to interact with Superman.....while sharpening his blade.

Then, when the fight occurs, there's a slight tinge of sadness where they know the other but also hate each other.

why would he do that when even in comics, Bats has a neutralise plan against sups?

How did he create the plan in the first place?

How can he find Superman's weakness if he hasn't studied him and his actions.

In most comic book stories, Batman is already friends with Superman when he creates a plan to neutralise him ([and every member of the JL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJVvrmLSTsg)). 

[Superman even helps him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGq3wEGFgBM)

even in Rebirth comics batman doesn't trust silver age superman even though he had lived a full life with the superman.

He's not the same Superman he knew all those years.

You're talking about Clark White right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> so that was his mistake and he tried to correct it by reasoning with him in second fight.

He didn't reason with him

Bruce didn't know that Superman's mother was kidnapped.

Superman gives up *very* quickly.....even though he tanked all of the countermeasures Bruce created (gatling gun,sonic cannon).

Clark decided to push Batman far enough to cause a few broken bones...he then throws him to the right.....finally smashing him through a building.

A stupid decision from a man who knows his mother will die at any moment.

because he thought only 'words don't stop him, only fists'.

He didn't even say anything.

Lets analyse what Superman said;

*"Bruce, please - I was wrong"* - All that conveys to Batman is that the most dangerous being on this earth knows his name.

*"You have to listen to me"* - Why should Bruce listen to him, he hasn't said anything of value.

*"Lex wants..."* - The first attempt to convey his situation to Bruce, which fails due to the sonic cannon.

*"You don't understand"* **in an extremely angry tone** - Understand what? Batman didn't hear the line about Lex, all he sees is this dangerous alien walking towards him in a menacing manner.

Bruce says *"I understand"* and Superman pushes Batman.

After Superman destroyed the Gatling guns, he had all the opportunity in the world to tell Bruce of his situation...but he didn't.

So in this case, Superman didn't even use words....just his fists.

if you watch the movie for what it is, you will like it

I didn't, as I saw all the missed opportunities.....all the problems.

You should try a marvel and netflix logo at the start instead of DC comics, and just ignore it is directed by zack snyder, YOu will love it.

You are a condescending ass, aren't you?

	<TEXT> Well true since one doesn't know the other guy and one is just a loner and wants to chat over a phone over ideologies, great interaction it would be.

**Two Years**

It has been two years since the BZ Event.

Bruce could have easily found a way to interact with Clark.

In the Animated show, Bruce bought the Daily Planet...which is how they eventually found each other's alter egos.

If Snyder/Terrio truly wanted a Batman/Superman movie, they should've created a relationship similar to the Peter Parker/Norman Osborn relationship.

Bruce has found a way to make acquaintance with Clark, as he studies him and creates protective measures against him (Red Sun, Kryptonite etc).

Bruce and Clark are amicable but Batman and Superman hate each other.

Superman due to the brutality of Bruce's vigilante justice.

Batman due to the BZ Event and Clark's unlimited power.

It would create the necessary tension needed for the fight.

It would be an amazing interaction...so I disagree with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean do you want them to have debate or interaction about why should and shouldn't batman kill sups?

Ofcourse I do.

Batman sees Superman as a danger to humanity.

The logical conclusion would be to research his enemy and find out what type of person he is.

Every good Batman/Superman story has some tension between the two characters and they find a way through fighting AND discussion.

Superman smashing Batman's vehicle and warning him was the wrong decision.

After researching on Batman and his brutality, it was a good place for him to find out what made Batman tick. Instead, he gave Bruce's hate more ammunition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> and the plot and how the story progressed didn't give them the chance to have a proper conversation.

You're acting as if the plot is some concrete entity that can't be edited to fit in more interactions.

Edit: The knightmare scene confrontation was EPIC.

....but it had little to do with the actual plot.

This is the first time Superman had "Voluntarily" involved himself with "Human problems"

What do you mean?

and it showed how he was trying to bully batman with his strong words and action.

Emphasis on **bully**......

How sad - we live in a world where "Superman" and "bully" can be uttered in the same sentence.

Sups face when Batman didn't even flinch and hardly cared showed that he wasn't an ordinary guy dressed in the bat suit.

What does that have to do with OP's statement?

	<TEXT> Problem is Superman wasnt close to Batman at all. They met for 30 minutes and when they first met Batman was hellbent on killing Superman. Then comes the Martha moment (which im not bashing here, that scene was ok and i see what Snyder was trying to do) and all of a sudden theyre close now??

That's what I've been trying to say, but with far more words.

We've had a Batman who absolutely hates Superman for almost 2 hours, but suddenly - he changed.

20 years of good men/women dying to save citizens in Gotham didn't change his jaded nature....so why would an alien he had planned to kill for two years.

If Superman and Batman had more interactions, I would at least understand it.

	<TEXT> He was angry. Angry Superman has glowing red eyes. You misunderstood.

In MoS, he was angry multiple times, but never had glowing red eyes.

He was ready to kill Lex.

If the red eyes were a sign of anger, Clark would have had an uncontrollable amount of heat vision after Zod tried to hurt Martha (MoS).

He didn't believe he had a legacy. He saw himself as a failure, and that stopping Superman was the only valuable thing he would do with his life.

My comment was basically agreeing with you.

Because there's absolutely no indication whatsoever that an alien might need a family like humans do.

But how does having a family making him any less dangerous?

I would go further to say that an alien with human connections is far more dangerous.....since he has the faults and feelings of a human and the powers of a god.

No shit. That's the whole point of the movie.

My comment was in regards to thi9s assumption that Batman suddenly stopped because he found out Superman was a good person. 

What I'm trying to say is that Batman **knew** Superman was a good person but still fought with him.

Not many people agree with me on this point.

It literally did. That's exactly what happened.

	<TEXT> "This is my world. You are my world."

I took the the two quotes in the same way.

"This is my world" meaning his love for her as she is in his arms and the second a reconfirmation.

He took Doomsday into outer space to protect the people in the city and allowed himself to get nuked, after Doomsday had emitted that radioactive shockwave.

I understand his actions saved humanity and the people, but you never see him directly address it.

For example, wouldn't taking Doomsday to the far reaches of space be far smarter than causing nuclear winter?

I had honestly thought Superman would stop the bomb and find a way to take Doomsday as far away from earth as possible.....a way to avoid a situation similar to his father's.

And it was a direct parallel to his father's story from earlier in the film, about how Martha reminded him that there still was good in the world.

His father's story was literally about how the Lang farm washed away and the horses drowned because of their actions to save their farm. 


I took it as Superman being warned by his father that good actions could result in horrible consequences, even with the right intentions.

However, yes - he did say his wife (Martha) showed him the good in this world.



Cinematic Batman has never been the genius he is in the comics and cartoons. I prefer the cinematic version. For me it's just more realistic. 

I honestly don't see what's so realistic about a Batman who goes into a fight blind.

How can Lois find Clark in a matter of days when he was a nobody but Bruce Wayne can't? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Superman is someone that doesn't wear a mask or even gloves so it is highly unlikely that he has a secret identity.

huh?

So why didn't his colleagues at the Daily Planet recognize him?

Why couldn't Bruce find out his identity after two years?

Why did Superman destroy the drone sent from the military in MoS, if not to protect his identity?

He does have a secret identity.

he also said taking down superman secures the future, the world didn't think superman had an actual connection to humanity like he didn't have anything to lose till bruce found out he had a human mother.

Why would Superman having a human mother suddenly stop him from committing an atrocity in the future?

Every single murderer, child molester, thief and crook has both a mother and a father. Did their "connections" stop them from harming people?

Bruce stopping himself from killing Clark because he has a human mother makes no sense.

At the end of the day, he's still an alien who has the powers of a god and no political affiliations or border that can stop him....having a human mother doesn't change that.

We've already seen what Clark can do when he's angry (smash a truck with telephone poles, stabbing Batman's heart (knightmare), destroy a factory and petrol station in MoS, destroying a multi million dollar drone in MoS, smashing an African warlord through multiple walls, severely damaging the Batmobile and smashing Batman through an entire building. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The main idea is that he realized his anger at Superman was misplaced.

I honestly don't think it was misplaced.

I do think it was foolish to try and kill Superman, but his fears were legitimate.

I also understand why he was angry, we in the real world are still sad/angry when it comes to 9/11...so you can imagine what an attack the size of 10 9/11's would do to the world.

Supermans sacrifice despite all the terrible things Batman and the larger world have done to him is what inspired him to believe in mankind again.

The death of Superman is one of the scenes that never truly sat well with me.

During the entire fight, we didn't see Superman protect or even mention a single civilian. When he was being battered in Metropolis by Doomsday, he was thrown into a building.

That really disappointed me...after the backlash in MoS - Snyder couldn't even give us **one** scene where we are seeing Superman aware of his surroundings during a fight.

When he grabbed the spear, Superman said something to Lois.

*"You are my world"*.

You can interpret that as a simple loving gesture between lovers, but I think it meant far more.

To me, Superman admitted that Lois was his world, that no one else mattered to him and he was attempting to kill Doomsday to save her....atleast that is the vibe I got.

Superman's sacrifice did save the world, but I don't think it was truly for mankind.

I guess in my eyes, Batman would actually be the opposite of hopeful, instead becoming depressed at another good man being killed.

*"How many good guys are left?"*

He waited nearly 18 months before he found a weapon that could kill Superman, before actually confronting him. He knew he would only get one shot at it. He was so blinded by his rage that he was actually contemplating murder as his one true legacy.

I fully understand his rage, but the way he went about fighting Superman is the most idiotic thing I've seen Batman do.

This is the preparation master we're talking here, the man who can fight anybody given enough prep. Any person with a decent intellect would've researched Superman's identity and his abilities thoroughly before fighting him.....oh well.

It's because he's jaded and cold that I can't believe Superman could change him.

He has seen the death of so many people close to him, why didn't he change then?

Batman has hated Superman from afar for close to two years, and never contacted him or tried to find out who he was.

It's very hard for my head to wrap around an already jaded Batman suddenly being hopeful because an alien he wanted to kill for so long is dead.

It wasn't as if Superman being a good person was somehow a surprise, everybody knew what Superman did everyday....but Batman decided to kill him anyway.

Why?

His perceived goodness does not eclipse the extreme danger humans face if he ever decided to go against us.

Had Batman in BvS been a man who was angry but still stayed true to his ideals as a incorruptible vigilante, I would absolutely understand his change of heart.

If the Batman in BvS had been someone who was a relatively new Batman...I would've understood.

However, this Batman has been operating for twenty years and has practically seen everything. He has fought against many villains and lost many friends.

After the BZ event, Batman realised Clark was dangerous.

It didn't matter if he saved people or not, his "one bad day" could be the end of humanity.

This point was further reinforced to the audience when Superman almost blasted Lex in anger for kidnapping his mother.

Killing Superman meant more to Batman than his entire legacy.....which is why his "character development" doesn't work.

It was an open secret, that Superman was from Smallville and has lived in the US his entire life. The message from Zod in MoS also confirmed that he was the only extra terrestrial on Earth...so why was it so shocking he had a human mother and father who took care of him?

If Clark and Bruce had been "friends" (while their alter egos hated each other ala Spiderman and Green Goblin) or if there were several movies worth of character interaction, I would understand the change in Bruce at the end of the movie when Superman dies.

I know I'm going to be downvoted, but Batman killing Superman had nothing to do with "men still being good"....it was eliminating a man who could potentially destroy everyone.

The Finch Prequel comic book explores this, with the government calculating the potential death toll of one kryptonian on a rampage.

Bruce was an idiot for not finding Clark's identity and talking to him amicably, but his fears were proven by the knightmare.

Superman dying did not make Batman believe in mankind again, it showed Bruce that Superman was not truly a danger worth killing a good person for.

	<TEXT> With a good writer it could be great.

This is the excuse I always see and one I used to make for Snyder.

Before the release of BvS, I thought Snyder could hone in on his faults and improve them, since he had Terrio as a writer.

Afterall, Snyder made beautiful films and Terrio was an Oscar winning writer.....this would be a match made in heaven, right?

Wrong.

I thought Clark killing Zod in MoS would create the basis for his rule to avoid killing. I thought Snyder was planning to incorporate this into BvS from the beginning and that he would show us how Clark has grown and matured as a character.

One of the first Superman scenes in BvS has him smashing the general through a wall. I realised that Snyder has no intentions to fix any of his faults. He just continues to double down on the mistakes he constantly makes.

I don't want a visually beautiful Batman with no substance and over the top symbolism....I want an amazingly directed Batman with a great script....and there are a thousand directors that I would choose before Zack.

Snyder is the reason we have a mass murdering Batman...which I am sure will only be reinforced if he was the director of "The Batman".


Snyder is an amazing visual director, but can't create a compelling story for shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before the release of BvS, I thought Snyder was a genius.

He was using the horrible BZ event as a launch point of the universe, further exploring the new life of Clark Kent in Metropolis and Bruce's rage at the destruction.

I originally thought the story would fit neatly with MoS....we didn't get that.

The DCEU IS rushing.

Instead of BvS being a natural progression from MoS, exploring Superman's world while introducing Batman - we got a movie with Lex Luthor, Doomsday, Wonder Woman, Flash, nightmares, a kidnapping, Superman's death and funeral, the BZ event and the African incident.

Then this was followed up with SS, that did far less world building and only focused on the squad.

We will be soon entering the cinema to watch JL, in which we hardly know three of the main members.

We don't know much about Cyborg, Flash or Aquaman.

Which means JL has the insane task of juggling story and action......something even the Avengers had trouble with.

Marvel are not the gold standard, but they have succeeded where every film studio have failed....and I think that's highly commendable.

	<TEXT> but you actually have to trigger the nozzle for the fire to come out

Wrong.

The trigger is for the gas, the fire has no "trigger". The person using the flamethrower controls the amount of gas/liquid fuel that passes the flame.

The KgBeast looks at the hole in the tank and then turns the nozzle back on Martha.

Lets say he didn't.

Are you trying to tell me gas is stagnant?

Even if he stayed still, the gas would have spread across the room and catch on fire anyway.

Dumb criminals are bound to die by their own hand.

Batman was dumb enough to puncture a tank full of gas near an open flame AND Martha......who is literally a metre away.

There is no such thing as "direct" and "indirect" murder....just murder.

	<TITLE> Islam and Polygamy </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-15 12:53:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Salam guys.

I have a question that has perplexed me for so long.

Is polygamy even allowed in Islam?

That may be a stupid question, but please bear with me.

Surat An-Nisa (which means "The Woman") discusses an orphans' rights, beginning from the second verse.

4:2 *And give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute the defective [of your own] for the good [of theirs]. And do not consume their properties into your own. Indeed, that is ever a great sin.*

The first ayat is warning muslims not to take an orphan's property or to consume what they own.

The following ayat is the one proof many sheikhs use to support polygamy. It states;

4:3 *And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].*

In my opinion, The ayat is clearly talking about marriage with orphan women, yet every single sheikh I've seen omits it and uses half the ayat....turning an ayat discussing marriage with orphans into polygamy.

It's notorious, as scholars have multiple understandings of the ayat.



So, is the verse discussing marrying orphan women (Yatama - without a father), or is it saying to marry women other than orphans.

Here is a video from one of the only sheikhs I saw that have an alternative view, he has passed away.....Allah yarhamu.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbWvmANdj2M

From what I have researched, it's almost impossible for a normal muslim man to even commit Polygamy in a Halal manner.

The rules regarding it are so strict, many men can't obey Allah's command and do it in a halal manner....

What do you guys think? </TEXT>

A girl Chandler dated thought "the capital of Cambodia was Sean Penn".

The joke never landed for me, she just seemed like an idiot. 

Why would a woman assume the capital of a country was "Sean Penn"?

Until today - when I realised the capital of Cambodia is **Phnom Penh**.

I now realise the woman Chandler was dating wasn't stupid - but perhaps had trouble pronouncing the name or had trouble remembering it.

I confess I am the idiot college student who didn't even know the capital of Cambodia.....
