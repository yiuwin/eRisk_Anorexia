	<TEXT> Well I think we need a subreddit for people that don't bother looking at the side bar (me 50% of times, at least on my phone sry guys) where they can help out and report problems, both on all kinds of beta as well as general bugs and feedback. When we have an established subreddit for that, this subreddit will be much less crowded and actually more serious people will be able to use this subreddit more efficiently. 
However, I just want to remind everybody that you shouldn't be toxic about users who post irrelevant posts. Everybody makes mistakes. To you it seems that the foolishness never ends, but to them, it's probably their first post. You are taking out your anger built up from 50 different redditors on just one single poor guy!
If everybody keeps calm and just explain that the posts doesn't belong here in a nice and civilised way, that will surely decrease the number of irrelevant posts as well! :) </TEXT>

After watching a youtube video within the reddit feed in landscape-mode, the top bar (where it says "reddit" or is just black when scrolling or entering a post) became almost twice as large and is obstructing half of the top row of letter for titles on posts.

	<TEXT> Like some people already have said, you really want the feel of real weighted keys when playing. I started with a just plastic keyboard, then I got another better one, den a digital piano, then a real piano, and now I prefer grand pianos, but digital and regular pianos is ok ofc as well. If you start with a cheap, plastic non-weighted keyboard you are only going to end up spending much more money. 
Btw you can get pianos for free on ebay and similar sites as long as you are willing to pick it up yourself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, so, making music without a knowing any theory can be a very pleasant experience! I've been playing the piano for almost 13 years now (professionally somewhat consistently for 3 years) and I've been hard studying (more or less) complex jazz-theory for soon 4 years. (Right now I'm composing a fully orchestrated symphony!!! Yay!)
Each bit of knowledge on how stuff works and how other people use theory in their music has been restricting in what I find likeable in music. 
When I started playing (at the age of 6) I liked all sorts of music (I did not then have any experience with contemporary art/classical music). Now when I know how the harmonies work, I find all pop music boring (I still find 80's stuff interesting due to all the nice synths, and back then they actually used more complex harmony) but I appreciate more complex stuff like jazz-fusion, non functional harmony and other just, for the untrained ear, "non-musical sounding stuff". 
In every piece of knowledge I gained about harmony, I lost a lot of appreciation, but gained a whole world of new tastes and affinities. 

You don't need theory to make nice music, it actually can restrict you in what you feel is "nice". But I recommend studying the "rules" so you can break them :)

However. A midi keyboard is definitely enough if you only want to create music. (A sound card is only really needed if you want to use non-usb devices, microphones for example, but so long you use software instruments, you don't need a sound-card)
I still recommend YouTube to learn techniques for both how to get the most out of you DAW and software instruments of choice as well as techniques for how to compose!
You will surely find more and more complex stuff interesting and before you know it you are a non-functional freak XD

If you wan't to play the piano as a instrument however, get a real piano. Ot at least a weighted digital piano. 

Hope this helps!
Good luck!

EDIT:
You don't need a MIDI-keyboard, lot's of producers just use the piano-roll and click in notes, but a keyboard is a VERY helpful tool for learning theory.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my (jazz) piano teachers improvised a speech before he played one of his nocturnes. He was going on about how it was a sad song in fact all of his songs where sad or at least melancholic. -because *he said* -let's be real, a C major chord is just the third, fifth and seventh of an A minor chord. 

The way the speech led up to that point made it sound both so thoughtful and beautiful while still keeping a comedic tone. 

So yeah

All major songs are minor :) just played a little different. ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi!
I'm a music student from Sweden composing music as much as I can!
I compose and play lot's of both old and modern jazz (love fusion) and I'm writing my very first full orchestral symphony right now!

Anyhow
I would love to score the Official Bodega Saga (or whatever the Triforce thingy is) and make the music publicly available to the community!

I've scored a couple of indie movies and I'm involved in a few games. I also have previously worked with making musical-like orchestral scoring based on The Yogscast material.

[Here is my Orchestral Musical of Hat Films: "Mighty Derpulies"](https://soundcloud.com/arvid-olson/hat-films-symphonic-act-mighty-derpulies)

[Here is an reorchestration I did of the Zelda: Breath of the Wild E3 trailer](https://soundcloud.com/arvid-olson/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-e3-trailer-music-v2)

[Here is my released music on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Q5ACP3WvOdVQgzWZYkyL7)

[And on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/se/artist/arvid-olson/id666457106)

[Here is my Jazz-Fusion band's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvgqi4vlDw3mAf2P8UW5V9w? ab_channel=FluviusBand)

[Here is my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpmCKkqotPb6mS8HM-PXLrw? ab_channel=ArvidOlson)

And I'm @arvidex on Twitter

Please comment if you would like some music from me and what kind of tracks (Like: Epic Battle, Soaring Landscape, Empty Space, New Adventure etc.) </TEXT>
