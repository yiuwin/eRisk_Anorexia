	<TEXT> Again, it's not the women who made the film, it's a competition piece and something a film maker did in accordance with the rules to the competition. It wasn't a vid about the product (quite possibly the op is to "blame" for making it sound that it's a vid about invisible helmets, again, if any blame is to be dispensed). The director most likely had loads of tidbits from interviews to choose from, and this is how he edited it, including choosing the "cheesy music". Perhaps it's because I'm Swedish and understood, not reading the subtitles; they are not bragging, they are telling a story about having an idea that some people believed in enough to invest capital in, even though once some geezer figured they'd be needing a man to run such a project. What's ridiculously over the top is the critique of the women (sooo typical women-type of comments), and that makes it misogony, I'm afraid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To your second question; I feel it's a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" type of deals, I think. I would like to know, beforehand, if not for the moment of aw for it happening! Also, the cynic in me wouldn't want any sort of "interest" represent the human kind in secret. On the other hand, the day we get visitors from other planets, we're probably as doomed as most indigenous people that were around once "civilization" hit them, and perhaps it would be preferable to live yet another while in ignorant bliss... ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, if his point was to blame yourself, you have a valid point of course. However, I got the impression that he meant the opposite, like shit happens, nobody's truly evil, you need to move on, break the patterns that landed you in the mess in the first place. Like seeing you're a part of a problem, or something like that. I realize, when writing, that I can't be sure that's what he meant, a lot was said. Guess he was musing all over the place, and can be interpreted differently. </TEXT>

When reading the comments on youtube, and here, most seem to notice his voice, and I went all meta, thinking that perhaps the lyrics these days are so bad in general, that people stopped paying attention to the words.

	<TEXT> Please forgive a (no doubt) clueless question; I'm confused by this thread. How is it that she is supposed to be able to argue in the matter? Does the DEA both decide and uphold the laws? Isn't it the politicians that propose and set laws in motion, that government organizations like the DEA uphold? Where I'm from (Sweden) a civil servant can defend/justify/argue laws if they want to, a bit of a problem sometimes though, in my view, when they do. As they're employed (i.e. not elected) to make sure the laws (right or wrong) are upheld, it might not always be prudent. If anybody could explain to me how this works in the US, I'd be grateful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The karma system isn't going to change or anything - but I'm wondering if up- and downvotes didn't make a user karma-points, just sorting out the most voted on and least, if things would look different? It would be interesting with a karma-free week or something like that, where up- and downvotes merely affects what ends up on the front (or top comments), and doesn't count towards personal karma. I'm not sure really if anything would be different, being upvoted without actually keeping a score on your account, would probably still be a sort of achievement to many. Attention is a bit of a currency online in general, after all. Oh well, I guess regarding issues to worry about, the karma system of Reddit ranks pretty low when all is said and done, but I am kind of curious if people would post less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've more or less reached the conclusion that if I want truly qualitative cinemagraphs, I'm going to have to film with my system camera and be pixel-careful in photoshop. However, I really, really like the [spontaneity](http://s3.amazonaws.com/cine_1/9666903.gif) of using an app - seeing something and shooting it on a whim, just for fun. As much as my standard needs to be in alignment with the tool used, talent and time alotted, it really annoys me that it's so difficult to hold the phone steady. Do you guys have any tips on how to improve the steadyness (a word?) when using the phone?
