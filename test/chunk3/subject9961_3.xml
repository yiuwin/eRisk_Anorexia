	<TEXT> They seem to be very vague for me. I am not a lore person at all and also pretty bad at English. Is there mod that make skill descriptions hide lore and only show mechanic ? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Current PoE player - should i buy Diablo 3 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-12 15:04:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been following Diablo 3 for a while, and with all that excitement around the new patch, i am considering grabbing a copy. It would be wonderful if you guys can help me compare the two games.

-What i like about PoE:

- Looting rare currency or uniques feels pretty darn amazing

- Interesting skill interact

- Deep character progression

- Build diversity

- An end game

-What i don't like about PoE:

- Crafting feel punishing since you can spend your whole inventory of currency and not get anything from it

- End game wall, level 85-90+ contents feel too hard to complete without extremely expensive builds

- You can't really make any meaningful progess to your character after reaching level 80

- No support for trading

	<TEXT> They nerfed dungeons because all their new maps have meta events that crave high player population, large amount of players doing dungeon prevents that from happening. So with this daily idea both dungeon and those new maps can both exist </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Similar to fractals, dungeon dailies will have you do specific paths of specific dungeons. Reward chest can be rare drop of dungeon skins, U-token which can be used to trade for any dungeon tokens, or even gold. With this change, not only will HoT maps population be unaffected, it can also help to make use of the incredible contents A-net has left dying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Dad is a non-alcoholic, non-smoking, loving father. He was the only one who took care of my mother when she was sick. He even studied cooking recipes for the high-blood pressure because he couldn't stand my mom having only carrot soup. Yesterday, she said he treated her like shit, that he's just doing all of this because he pity her. She's been like that all the times but this has been the worst. I am so angry with her right now i can't think straight, please help me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bought Fallout 4 2 days ago, and still haven't got the chance to play due to stutter problem, please help! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-13 08:17:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's my spec:

i5-2320 3.0GHz

Radeon HD 7790 1Gb

4gb ram

I keep getting major stutter, frequently near objects. Got stuck in a house at Commonwealth and had to load a previous save. Did try tinkering with the .ini ( shadow, borderless etc..). My pc isn't particularly decent, but i am running the game on a 1360x768 resolution, thought it might at least hold up at the lowest setting. 

Please, if you have any fix that i should try, do post them below, really don't want to spend my next days just watching playthrough on youtube :(. </TEXT>
