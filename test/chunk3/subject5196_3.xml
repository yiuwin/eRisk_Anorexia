	<TEXT> This is my review of the book from last year, just for fun: 

I was *this* close to giving the book a three, based on chapter 11 alone, but as the story progressed and the finale approached, I forgot all about how tedious (though significant) that particular section of the book was, and just fell back in love with Wilde's prose. The arc of the story is a little cinematic in its predictability, which is why I am so shocked there isn't a really great film adaptation of this out there. If you're going to remake everything else, Hollywood, I'd like to see this one next. 

I gave it an 8 in the poll here and a 4/5 on Goodreads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, the first time I updated it, I lived through the nightmare for about two weeks before I said, "K, this isn't going to work" and found a way to roll it back.  I lived in contented bliss like that for about 6 months til I started to get worried about security updates my phone was missing out on.  I figured in that amount of time they must have fixed the update, but it turned out they didn't. 

I didn't have the energy to try rolling it back again, so I got a Moto X instead. 

Now that I don't have the safety of that waterproofing knowledge, I'm in constant panic again whenever my phone is near water, lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just picked it up from the library today, so I haven't even cracked it open yet, but the person who recommended it to me has never steered me wrong on a book yet, so I have high expectations.  

I'm in the same boat as you, 10 hour workday, plus a LOT of side projects I get myself involved in, and suddenly it's like, "Books? What are those?"

I should read Invisible Man, again, a movie I absolutely adored.  I'd be curious to see if I feel the same about the book. </TEXT>

I read the Time Machine on a school trip in high school.  I was amazed by two things: 1) That I finished it on the trip. 2) That while it was completely different than my film experiences with the material, I actually liked it way more than the film that I was already quite fond of (the more recent adaptation with...~~Hugh Jackman?~~Guy Pearce. </TEXT>

I love this book as much now as I did then.  So dark, but funny at the same time.  Once I finish it, I'm sure it will rest among my all-time favorites list. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, you would've heard about it, don't worry.  It's going to be a huge big-budget movie next year.  ;). 

There was so much I didn't like about it, which I've posted about ad naseum, here, but to sum: I felt the author was very lazy with his world he created.  He had so much he could have done, but instead relied on the creativity of others to cover his apparent inability to accurately describe anything.  "It looked like the Death Star." "It was just like this one Dungeons and Dragons level." Etc.  I love sci-fi, but I don't feel I'm hard to impress.  This book had a lot to offer, and I felt like it never delivered on that potential. 

I have huge faith in the film adaptation, however, since Spielberg is doing it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The list so far has made me *very* anxious.  It's a minefield of books I'm REALLY interested in, and then my least favorite type of books.  

There's enough stuff present, though, that I'm going to find something to enjoy no matter what happens.  

I think RPO really got me started with this whole thing on the right foot: A book I *really* didn't like, but enjoyed discussing why I didn't like it enough to get me through it.  This whole thing for me is about expanding my reading horizons, so I don't mind reading things I don't like, because I'm reading, and that's something I haven't been doing regularly for a few years now, and I hated that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was hard to pick a favorite between this and NCFOM, but I was really quite pleased with the book.  Better than the movie? An inconceivable yes, from me.  But only by a hair, they're both really impressive works, and I'm so glad I took the time to read them. 

Ironically, though, I find some of my favorite reading moments here came not from the book itself, but the forwards and the intro to *Buttercup's Baby*.  Specifically the mid-life crisis moment in the airport.  What a wonderfully written paragraph that was.  It hit me right in the gut, because I understand so well what it feels like to realize that you may be inadequate at a thing you love.  

Great last two weeks, and I'm glad this turned around after a bit of a flagging start (for me of course!).  

I've read PoDG, so I'll read Catch 22, which I started in college, but never had the time to finish.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Diversity within the genre was very obvious.  We had a classic, a recent novel, a slightly more heady story about good vs evil, and a fantasy novel.  

Instead of something like Treasure Island, Robin Hood, The Hobbit, Harry Potter.  

The books, you know, the thing we're all trying to read and enjoy? were incredibly diverse. </TEXT>

I was very sad that neither of the leads from this film were nominated.  Instead of watching films like The Danish Girl, which brought nothing to the table, this movie really made my day.  It's fantastic.  Same goes for the argument about black actors not getting nominated.  There are better examples than the people in Straight Out of Compton.  See Dope, for example. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read an awful lot, actually, and the books I read tend to hover at around 70/30 male to female.  Again, as I mentioned, I don't even notice, because the gender of the author is meaningless to me. 

I get what you want, I understand it, but for these genres, especially classics (though I agree, I'm surprised there was no Jane Austen) I'm not SHOCKED there aren't as many female authors.  

Before we go full on panic-mode, I'd be curious to see what happens next month.  

I'm certainly not saying anything against expanding horizons, but I don't know that the gender of the author is necessary to doing that beyond what we're doing already.  

I guess we'll likely find out, as there seems to be a strong enough voice of people who want to try this out.

	<TEXT> I've started eating something every 2 hours while I'm at work.  What I'll do is have a small snack when I first get there, something less than 100 calories.  Then two hours later I'll have a piece of fruit.  In the next two hours I eat HALF of my lunch.  At first I thought I'd be too hungry doing this, but I started to realize that, actually, this really worked out for me very well.  Then 2 hours later, another small snack, finally followed by the rest of my lunch (I work a 10 hour shift).  

It's become a really good method for me, and has helped me exponentially with portions as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a female, I don't read books because of the gender of the author, I read them because I like the subject matter.  *shrug* .  And honestly, for books I've not heard of, I rarely look at the Author's name and decide if they're man or woman, either.  </TEXT>
