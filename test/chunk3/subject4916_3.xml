	<TEXT> She already is at the hospital and is being treated. Her mind hasn't changed though.. 
I just want her to know that she is beautiful and should try to eat. If anyone can make her feel better about herself it should be her boyfriend, right?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's start from the start. After we had a relationship for 2/3 weeks she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. I was able to deal with all of that and stay by her side. Now, roughly one and a half months later, she has been diagnosed with anorexia. First I thought it was because of chemo therapy, no hunger, nausea..
I asked her today if it had anything to do with her not liking her own appearance. It turns out that plays a big deal in all of this. She wants to look "pretty" for me and feels fat. 

She is NOT fat, in my eyes she is the most beautiful and cute girl I have ever seen. She just doesn't see it this way. She is really one of those beautiful girls that thinks she is not. 

I've been trying to tell her, and I have told this to her in the entire relationship, that I love the way she looks and that I will always love her, no matter how she looks. And whenever I tell her how beautiful she is, she keeps telling me she is not.

What I'm going to need is, advice on how I can convince her that she is beautiful, a beautiful letter to her showing that I love her and that she should not worry about her looks. Letting her know that she is not fat at all. 
I would like to write it myself, but I'm not much of a writer. It's of great importance that she starts eating or it might interfere with her chemo therapy. 
Please write down advice, a loving letter. I will combine what I think is useful in a long letter to her and I will read it to her. I hope she will finally realize that she needs to gain weight. </TEXT>
