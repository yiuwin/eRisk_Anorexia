	<TEXT> Whenever i hear the song Get Down with the Sickness by Disturbed i think of Guts and the Berserker armour and his internal battle with the Beast of Darkness.
[The Chosen Few by Electric Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-1RnTm31ng) makes me think of the apostles during the eclipse, i wish someone would make a AMC for it someday.
And of course, [In My Room by the Beach Boys makes me think of Griffith after he was captured whenever i hear it because of this damned AMV.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrsNV11XYP4)

	<TEXT> All i'm saying is that its possible within the framework of the story, and that it was implied at the time of the engagement that there was some sort of conspiracy going on and (as someone else mentioned) Farnese's mother foreshadowed that Farnese would reject it in the end.
I think its more likely that he will get killed off at some point in the future, because if some sort of plot involving Ys isn't fleshed out, than he has very little purpose in the story once Guts and Co. make it back to the mainland. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the deal will break down if they return to the mainland and no longer need the ship or if Roderick tries to take her back to Ys and split her up from Sheirke and her magic lessons.

Edit: Another thing i just realized, Roderick is *third* in line to the throne of Ys. That means there is someone in between him and the current ruler. If the current ruler is his father, that could mean he has an older brother in the way to him inheriting the throne. Its possible within the current framework of the story that him and Magnifico have some underhanded plan at putting him on the throne, and the two imply some sort of plan is being put into place when they arrange Farnese's engagement. As such, its entirely possible that Roderick has a devious/malevolent side to him we have yet to see, and once this is exposed it could turn Farnese against him completely.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Anime doesn't get up to Episode 355 yet man, it stops before Casca goes insane again once Guts kills Roderick in a duel over Farnese when he tries to kidnap her and take her back to Ys. There was no way Guts was ever gonna get back on that boat man, never again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rickert got lit up man in Episode 355, Dannan tricked him into eating poison cookies after Guts spurned her for Farnese. Once Sheirke discovered it was Dannan that did the deed, Erika tried to take revenge by attempting to blow her out of the sky with Rickert's rocket launcher, but she dodged it, and cut poor Erika down before the Skullknight popped out of a timerift flying on Zodd's back and sliced off her wings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, the Italian MAS boats which attacked the ship quickly escaped. Survivors where picked up by other Austro-Hungarian vessels which were close by. The Italian torpedoboats were chased for some time by an austrian torpedoboat, but they threw depthcharges behind them, and the severity of the explosions from the depth charges caused the Austrian boat to give up the chase. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After the attack whoever was in command believed that the ship was still savable, and the SMS Tegetthoff (the ship which the cameras were on) initially took the ship under tow and attempted to bring it back to port. Despite no order to abandon ship being given, the vast majority of the crew survived the sinking due to mandatory swimming training provided by the Austrian navy (most other navies of the era had no mandatory swim training or only very rudimentary training programs). Given that there were other Austro-Hungarian naval vessels in the immediate vicinity of the sinking, rescue operations were pretty quick to get into action. 89 men out of the crew of 1094 lost their lives. </TEXT>
