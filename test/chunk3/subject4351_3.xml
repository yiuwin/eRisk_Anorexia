	<TITLE> Stan Romanek Abductions Documentary </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-02 02:49:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I watched a hour and fifty minute long live documentation of an abductee named Stan Romanek claiming hes been followed and abducted by aliens several times, implanted, and has hybrid children. There is footage of him getting calls through the answering machine from a voice automated message coming from the aliens telling him things about him being a starseed. It is the most intense documentary ive seen and I don't see why it would be fake. The things that happen to him and the evidence that is presented is to far our to just come up with. I highly recommend you watch this documentary it is intense and entertaining.

	<TEXT> This is the Source/infinite creator giving us this information thats why its refering Itself to you/us/everyone and capitalizing Me.
Your Immortal Essence - Your God Self- Conciousness. It is implying that it is the consciousness within all of us. Why are you assuming things? Seems like you don't really have an open mind. I'm not gullible I just know what im talking about and I like stating my opinions. I did not create this myself this was channeled by someone else. In my opinion this is a reminder to let us know we are all connected. We are infinite consciousness having a physical experience, therefore we can tap into information of any sorts if we learn how to. This isn't a message to trick you into believing somthing, it is a message of guidance.

"To access your Immortal Essence(Higher Consciousness) requires the use of a new "organ" (Possibly the pineal gland) of "other-worldly" (Sixth sense) sensation to be aware of a preciousness, an ultra-pristine purity, a crystal-like transparent radiance and power of ecstasy that is neither in the body nor outside the body. Because it is neither of space nor of time. It just Is. It is the Immortal Essence that is Me. (Higher Consciousness)"

"By Knowing Me you do not need to travel through the many dimensions of the universe to find Me in the end! Because this deviation is not necessary!

"I am your god-self!" It is refering to being consciousness . God = Consciousness/Light

It pretty much states it at the beginning of the Paragraph.

"I speak of concentration not in the sense of concentration in space or time, but in the sense of concentration of Being-ness, of intense Spiritual Energy, unconfined and Expanded Consciousness, but not expanded in space."

	<TEXT> Its based on a novel by the same name, Set in northern Scotland, it traces an extraterrestrial who, manifesting in human form, drives around Scotland and tries to lure unsuspecting men into her van. I don't want to say much more cause it will just spoil the movie for you.
This is my favorite Alien movie of all time besides Alien, The Thing and Prometheus. I highly recommend you watch it, I've watched it many times and I am not if there will ever be an Alien movie like it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not that I have witnessed or know about, but one thing that I thought was interesting was there was flowing water streams close by and I heard on ghost adveentures it is a conductor for paranormal activity on one of the episodes.

Water is an electrical conductor - To a certain extent , but a very poor conductor. Paranormal activity is electrical in nature therefore, water conducts it. 
Running water produces energy - Running water does have energy and since paranormal activity requires energy it draws it from the water. 
Running water produces White Noise - White Noise will be a subject to talk about in a later posting. 

The truth is nobody knows how water affects paranormal activity. No studies have been done. There is no direct correlation currently. However, this is slowly changing. The data is finally starting to be collected in some areas. For example, in the ParaMap database (www.paramap.com), you can run geographical scans of states, plotting haunting reports against their water table zones. In some cases there are patterns. This does not mean that the paranormal is affected by water, but it is food for thought.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Definitely the scariest dream I have ever had in my life and I never want to have it again. In my dream I would just be hanging out in my basement suite which was where I was living, just laying on my bed and a very disturbing face would come out of the wall or absolutely no where and start screaming at me, It was for sure demonic. When I would leave a room to escape it, he would re appear out of nowhere to scream at me again. No matter where I went he would appear and scream at me, even if I went outside. I remember when I woke up it felt like the dream was quite a long time and was broken out into a sweat. The disturbing thing is that the dream had happened again on two different occasions.

	<TEXT> One time me and my friend went outside in his backyard forest(Couple acres) at probably close to 1am to go explore and theres a steep cliff when you first walk in. When we were standing at the cliff before the path way leading down to the rest of the forest I could see a white illuminated figure but it was pitch black and it was in between two trees kind of pacing around between the trees. I asked my friend if he could see it as well while I felt frozen with fear with shivers/static electricity going through my body and had the feeling you get when somone close dies or Impending Doom, and he sounded like he was feeling the same way and clearly scared shitless so we just got the hell out of there. The figure was pure white seemed to be at least 6 feet or something from where we were standing but had no physical apperance except for very long arms it kind of looked like how a ape would have its arms, It was pitch black around it but it seemed to be illuminated white somehow. To this day the feeling that I got when I saw that still gives me shivers, something so powerful that it emits a powerful vibe of fear and death. The fact that we went out to his forest at that time really late at night and happened to see that freaks me out as well, cause it was clearly supposed to be seen by us. If we went out any later or any sooner we might not have seen whatever it was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our God Self - Your Immortal Essence

MY BELOVEDS.

One day your body will die.

Your body will dissolve back into its elements. It provided you with an experience in this realm of intense density, with the illusion of separation and duality and therefore of the lower mind and lower emotions.

During these times you forgot your Pure Immortal Essence, which is not just a spark but a concentration of My Existence itself.

I speak of concentration not in the sense of concentration in space or time, but in the sense of concentration of Being-ness, of intense Spiritual Energy, unconfined and Expanded Consciousness, but not expanded in space.

It seems to be a paradox but it is not, because it does not exist in your familiar dimension, rather it is dimension-less and therefore so to speak above your usual awareness, but not above in space!

It is like an Immortal Elixir that exists beyond your senses of the body-mind and how you measure and classify your experiences.

To access your Immortal Essence requires the use of a new "organ" of "other-worldly" sensation to be aware of a preciousness, an ultra-pristine purity, a crystal-like transparent radiance and power of ecstasy that is neither in the body nor outside the body. Because it is neither of space nor of time. It just Is. It is the Immortal Essence that is Me.

It is of extreme transcendental clarity and beauty, free of objects and otherness, it is spotless and without any attributes. It is free of creation but it is the foundation of creation. From there creation draws its much weaker power. And from there creation is a playful but un-necessary illusion because of its relative frailty compared to My Original Power of Existence.

Divine Immortality is yours, insofar as you dare to release the fear of letting go what you created, release the fear of letting go your identity with your creations, desiring with all your heart to know again What and Who You Are in Truth.

In this clarity, in this peace, in this unstained and changeless, otherworldly transcendental Divine Reality you Know intrinsically that you have never been born and that you will never die because you recognize your True Essence. And when you drop your body, you merely let behind a tool of experiencing certain dimensions, in this case the dimension that you call the third, or perhaps subtler dimensions. 

It is not really then a major event. It is just letting go some lower vibrations and their ramifications, the creations within this realm, but which had not really anything to do with the One That You Truly Are, because you have mastered detachment.

But detachment is never an activity of your ego, a wilful, unhappy and ascetic act of renunciation of yours. It is the Power of My Reality that un-chains you from bondage, because you know Me and you Love Me. 

By Knowing Me you do not need to travel through the many dimensions of the universe to find Me in the end! Because this deviation is not necessary!

Now a time has come where you are to directly assume Your Immortal Self that Is Me, as soon as you comprehend the universe as an extension of Me, because I have dissolved your bondage in Me.

I AM Your God-Self!
