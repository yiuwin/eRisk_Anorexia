	<TEXT> Hmmm... looks like a hoax to me. Talk1017 is registered at GoDaddy - http://www.whois.net/whois/talk1017.com
Talk 1200 is registered to Clear Channel Identity, Inc.
http://www.whois.net/whois/talk1200.com
I don't think a huge corporate entity like Clear Channel would buy a domain through GoDaddy.

Of course, http://www.radiobdc.com (where the old WFNX staff is) is real </TEXT>
