	<TEXT> Spot on. My neighbor and I have been having the same conversation for about 3 weeks every time we see each other. The topic: Jean Claude Van Damme, ballerina or legit fighter and could he handle 5 rounds in the Octagon?  
  
 Our SO's are literally shaking their heads every time we interact because no matter how the conversation starts, it ends in the JCVD debate.   
For the record, I consider JCVD a ballerina (I do love his movies though).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree.   
I stumbled upon that article years ago and was always hoping more would come of it. As somebody else posted there is a rational wiki that debunks the claim.   
However I did find some information yesterday about studies done in that area for radiation, however there are actual Power Plants in the region so they were the source of the studies.  
All in all it seems like the article is over embellished with few actual sources provided. 
  

With that in mind, I think the story itself is very interesting. It allows the imagination to run wild a little bit. I, for one, have always found the ancient alien theories very interesting. When you look at the stories from the Bible or the Vedas and you read about chariots of fire in the skies, it's easy to relate these stories to some sort of alien interaction. I'm not saying I buy into this 100% but its an entertaining look into the past. </TEXT>

And just in case anyone is interested in the clue I gave before about it being based on a different source, according to wiki 
 The plot is based on the song "Earth Girls Are Easy" from Julie Brown's 1984 mini-album Goddess In Progress </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are people who believe that there was a[ nuclear explosion in India 8,000-12,000 years ago](http://veda.wikidot.com/ancient-city-found-in-india-irradiated-from-atomic-blast) which I always found interesting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im in agreement with you here.  
  
I do agree that seasons 3 and 4 are probably the best for the Wire but I really enjoy 1 and 2 also and they got me hooked into the story instantly. I can't imagine watching another season of BB in the hopes that by season 3 I care about the characters.  It really speaks to how TV shows are made these days with so much filler episodes to drag a plot line along. Episode 1 of the Wire was enough for me to say that I enjoyed the show and I wanted more. The entire first season of BB was me trying to convince myself it'll get better if I keep watching it.   
I guess this is what makes The Wire so great. Each episode was crammed with plot that it never lulled compared to other TV shows. I remember thinking S2 of The Wire sucked when watching it because it was so different than S1 but by the time I finished the series it was one of my favorite seasons.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had this argument recently. I've watched season 1 of Breaking Bad and didn't like it. Their response was "it really gets good after the third season!"....Ok but The Wire is really good after the first episode, i shouldn't have to wait 3 seasons for a show to capture my interest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got called a shill last week for not agreeing that the planes on 9/11 were computer generated and I was echoing the narrative laid out by the government by suggesting there were planes over NY that day...people just love to throw the term shill around in here. It really makes it hard to even comment in this sub sometimes because if you're not agreeing with every nuance of a conspiracy you're a shill.  </TEXT>
