	<TEXT> Yes. The writing on the original Animated Series was great (Mark Hamill is the voice of the Joker. All Batman fans agree HE is Joker. Also the voice in the Arkham games). Plus the movies are phenomenal. The Mask of the Phantasm, Batman: Under the Red Hood, Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. These are all great movies derived from the original show.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just stumbled upon this subreddit. It's my new favorite b/c it shows how awesome people can be to a total stranger. This restores my "faith" in humanity.

I did my first contest a few minutes ago and I'll see how well I did on Nov. 1st. Had to describe how I almost burnt down my house while cooking one strip of bacon. 

There are three things I like (not entirely but you get the idea): Batman, Doctor Who, and Game of Thrones. These things bring me closer to different family members and friends. That, and Firefly. 4 things. 

This was just me saying HI to everyone here and thank you for bringing happiness to others! True meaning of life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was 15, I loved bacon (I still do). No one told me how to make bacon. All I knew was you put it in a skillet and it magically becomes the greatest food ever. One summer, both parents were gone and I was at home alone with my little sister who was 9 or 10 years old at the time. To show my sister how awesome her big brother was, I decided to do some BIG CHEFIN' make some bacon. Well, I had never done it before (and this was near the beginning of the internet so there wasn't any quick searches on YouTube or asking fellow Redditors) so I just started with making one strip of bacon. JUST ONE. About 5 minutes later, the entire kitchen was filled with smoke! I quickly opened the back door and a few windows to get the smoke out. The lonely strip of bacon look like leather. To make matters worse, like an idiot in a panic, I quickly poured the grease in the trash can. It was still hot enough to melt through the bag and trash can. I had a lot of explaining to do to my parents when they got home....and no bacon. Truly a sad story.

Just a couple random questions: 

1) What's your favorite bass line to play?

2) Do people still ask you and Teller to rub butts instead of a handshake?

3) Favorite horror flick?

4) Favorite Three Stooges movie? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is this life that I am currently living truly real or is it a fantasy realm created by my imagination? Lately I've felt like it's just been some sort of landslide that I just so happen to be caught up in and the reality of it is that there is no escape.
At night, with eyes wide open, I look up into the clouds and stars above and all I seem to see is how broke and childish I am, but I am not asking for any sympathy. Like the saying goes, "Easy come, easy go." Some days are a little bit higher than others, but some are just a little bit lower.
I guess all I'm trying to say is that whatever the direction the wind is blowing, it doesn't really matter to me.
To me.

Told you I was high....none of this makes any sense.

Have a great day!

	<TEXT> If I had a theme song, it would be "Lenny" (even though I'm a Johnny). Every time I hear that track, it makes me smile. It's a simple track but it's that simplicity that really helps me enjoy the day. With that being said, "Riviera Paradise" is one of the world's greatest songs ever.
