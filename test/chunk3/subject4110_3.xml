	<TITLE> Drop Jered Weaver for Jordano Ventura? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-13 17:00:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am in a 10 person points league and my pitching has been awesome, except for Jered Weaver ruining everything for me. I'm wondering if he isn't going to have it this year and something is wrong with his mechanics. I have felix, price, cashner, gio, and hudson and I'm thinking it would be a good risk to take a chance with Ventura. Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really believe that there can be certain energies that are placed on a house from people even if they aren't dead. The house that I grew up in that my dad still lives in has a 100% different energy in it from when I was a child. It was always a happy, warm, inviting home. Ever since my parents have divorced it is different. The last few years in the home was a struggle and nobody was happy, including countless fights, ect. My mother says she still dreams she's living in the house and everything is great, including dreams where my sister and I are back to our elementary ages and she gives us the power to stay our same ages. forever. I sense that all the negative energy stayed within the walls and now the place has a creep factor to it to where I feel like there is constantly something going on. Always feeling like I'm being watched. It is a dark place and it never was.  </TEXT>

Now I just graduated from college and have not had a prescription for 6 years. It takes knowing what you want to achieve and superb time management skills. I really think that ADD is a made up condition anyways, some kids just tend to me more hyper than others.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's also the reason they have to charge such high interest. Their accounts receivable is so damn high that with the people they loan to the only way they can make a profit is by charging obscene interest rates.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok nobody is probably going to read this but just had to post. Back in high school I had a friend who was awesome! He was the kinda guy that would give you the shirt off his back and do absolutely any and everything for you. Lets call him BWAK.

 I always knew he down for theft cause he would steal bottles, cartons of cigarettes ect, but he would always share these items with all of us. A Robinhood of sorts. Still, I am not a very good writer and it is hard to put into words how much of a genuine awesome guy this dude was. He did so many great things for us.
The first of all things that happened was out of nowhere, my wallet went missing. I couldn't figure out what the fuck I did with it but just assumed that I lost it. Later that day, BWAK decided to take his girlfriend shopping (who was also one of my really good friends at the time). He also bought me food because he "felt bad" that my wallet went missing.

Short time after that were on my friend's sailboat and another wallet goes missing. Still, we didn't think that any of us would do it and we just assumed that he misplaced it or it happened to fall out of his pocket.

Couple weeks after that, my car is in the shop and I really need to drive to LA and he lets me use his car no questions asked, no worries. What a good bro right? When I return the car I end up leaving my wallet in the center console. When I call him about it, he has no idea where my wallet went but was a good guy and told me he found a $100 bill in the car that he believed was mine. (My wallet had over $400 in it). This is when I was starting to get a feeling that he was the one. Especially after one night of previously crashing at my house, I woke up in the morning and wallet just happened to have $100 less in it. I guess I must have miscounted.

Finally, he thought that he would strike one more time, we were at a friend's house and he left his wallet in his room and then it went missing too. We started to have him under suspicion but some people were disgusted with the fact that we would even think of accusing BWAK of doing such a thing. I end up leaving to college and we end up not hanging out anymore.

When I'm home the next semester or year visiting, I get a call from my high school, "Hey, I think that we have your wallet." I was stunned. I rush there as fast as possible to get it. 
It just so happens it wasn't my wallet. It was my friends wallet filled with all the credit and debit cards and ID's of every stolen wallet COMBINED. This kid was a completely two faced piece of shit. Cut ties off with him completely and he ended up stealing well over $1000 dollars from my group of friends.

A little good news I heard, a couple years ago (we haven't spoken in at least 5 years), he screwed over the wrong guy and got stabbed in the neck with a screwdriver. Unfortunately he lived. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in a new relationship (like 3 months)... haven't been in a real relationship in 3-4 years... Number one favorite thing that makes me love the hell out of this chick is that we both fart and are proud of it. I believe farting together is one of the best attributes a couple can have together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He claims to have watched it for an hour and then fed it bacon. He said it was very hesitant and aggressive at first and then it warmed up to them and eventually let them pet it.

	<TEXT> As a college grad who is graduating this week I can vouch that this works. I got a degree in project management (which I love) and am now getting out of college with a 42,000 base salary + uncapped commissions.  Really utilize the career center at your school and make friends with the counselors. Go to every career fair and send every company you talk to a personalized note. I had at least 12 interviews this semester alone. You can do it!! I see you mentioned joining a sorority, definitely do that as well. If the social greek system isn't for you, business fraternities which are co-ed are an excellent choice as well. They give you great resume experience and really shows your ability to work with people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can confirm this. My neighbor died and rotted in his house for three months and nobody noticed. (He was a sad, single, extremely rude old man with no family or friends). When people finally went inside his house they found his body half eaten by cats as well as over a dozen dead cats littered throughout the house. It was bad, I went in there after his body was taken out and it was realllllly creepy. You could see the spot on the floor from where the body sat there rotting.  </TEXT>
