	<TEXT> I don't get how Netflix couldn't make part of the deal for the 4th season that they get to distribute seasons 1-3 for as long as they want. That's a fucking stupid move on Netflix's part and it's the one thing that logically should have been a take it or leave it condition for sinking the money that they did into it. They just killed the money making potential of season 4 going forward and severely crippled the potential for season 5.   

It is just mind boggling that they could do something this idiotic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For outright vandalism that's clearly just for the sake of vandalism, I might agree. The problem is that most of the board now is monopolized by large pieces protected by people with scripts running and alliances protecting each others pieces. That leaves pretty much no room (there is still a tiny bit of wild space in the far bottom right corner) to work and add new things. Of course that's going to breed discontent and going to lead to individuals, if not groups, to try to overwrite existing works.   

Down with the fascist pixel oligarchy, viva la /r/place revolution!

Edit: Case in point, trying to use a little piece of black space on the edge of someone else's work at the edge of the canvas to create a 3px object, only to have it destroyed by someone, presumably using a script, that otherwise hasn't used Reddit in a week. Fuck the oligarchy here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Vertical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical integration). It's good for them, but bad for consumers, especially in cases like this. If they decide to stop pushing as much to Hulu (as unlikely as that is, since they own a stake in it), then that's just one more service that consumers now are paying for to get the same content they used to get before.   
Now, you might say that's not a problem, but when BBC has their own service for $7.99, ABC has their own, NBC, CBS, FOX, Netflix (which at that point would be almost all original content), etc... then you're paying the markup for each service. This would be great if it was just the internet taking care of the de-bundling problem, which is what people have been pushing to get for a long time, but they are each charging a premium that makes it more expensive overall. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disagree    

Fair enough, but it's a dick move regardless of him having good motives.   

What's if it's happening either way?   

I've seen that assumption posted here quite a few times. He kept it secret form his parents that he was gay for quite some time by the sound of it, so while it's not an unreasonable assumption that he would be (more widely) outed afterwards, it's not assured. Regardless, I would argue again that Milk was in no position to act based on that assumption. It was still bad faith on his part to make the move, against Sipple's wishes based on that assumption.   

Godwin   

It's hyperbole, I won't defend my statement in that regards, but "ends justifies the means" is never anything except a slippery slope. Also, it is a cold hard fact that it has been used many times to justify bad, sometimes horrible, things for ostensibly good reasons and good things for good reasons that have had bad unintended consequences. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter why Milk did it, he didn't have the right to. If Sipple had made the decision, that would have been a different story. Nobody has the right to make a choice for someone else because they think it's going to have a greater positive result overall, nobody.    

I hate to bring Godwin into this, but that ends justifies the means bullcrap is the same way Germany got Hitler. If you prefer, just replace those two names with any of a number of historical assholes who did the same thing Milk did, thinking that they knew better so they'd do what they wanted. The arrogance required to do, or even defend, that is astounding. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not that Hulu pays more for it, it's that Fox (along with NBC and ABC) owns the platform. It's akin to a cable provider owning a television network, which has in recent years been allowed but is still a huge conflict of interest.   
Besides, even when they put some of their content on Hulu, they're being anti-consumer by fragmenting the market more than necessary (although CBS going their own way is a better example of this) and forcing consumers to pay for each service piecemeal, paying more money overall. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any chance someone can code up a quick script to do a pull of this at a set interval? I feel like if we had a heads up that this was coming (which would have defeated the purpose of the April Fool's joke, I know), someone could have gotten this up and we could have a great timelapse archive. As it is, we'll just have to have people save bits and pieces somewhere like [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62rkq1/post_pixels_here_for_posterity_place_pixel/). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. That's at least a valid argument against it and my understanding is that is a fairly accurate assessment. I'm not sure what the proper response would be though. IMO it still isn't an outright ban on whaling, and attacking them on their (fairly weak IMO) claim to it being culturally necessary to preserve/continue the practice, would of course open the door up for criticism of many things other countries do in the name of culture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's hypocritical because the laws are on the books for the same reason that anti-whalers facetiously claim them as a legitimate reason to bash Japan. Also, the laws are unequal (i.e. in regards to Iceland), which points even more to how much of a lie the given reasons for going after Japan for whaling are.   
I'm not so much defending Japan here as attacking the stupidity of these laws and this attitude. Any law not based on a need to conserve an endangered species or to limit whaling for a legitimate purpose, such as sustainability, lacks legitimacy. Laws should be based on science not emotion as anti-whaling laws are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're doing yourself a disservice if you stopped reading there. I'm by no means I'm agreeing with them essentially removing themselves from international law, just that they have. It is **fact** that they are now ignoring the ICJ with the statement that they do not recognize its right to rule against them. I'm not sure why you're taking that out on me though.   

I'm still waiting for someone to give me a reason, other than blind affinity, to stop the hunting of a non-endangered species, at a sustainable level (I believe it's less than 1% per year), in a reasonably humane manner (they use explosive harpoons for a faster kill).    
I'll also bring up dogs again because the comparison is apt, even though dogs are even more abundant and sustainable than whales. Currently they are mistreated and abused both in life and in manner of killing in countries where they are eaten, but the same hypocrisy applies in saying that they shouldn't be killed and eaten (in a humane manner) just because we like them.   
The way that we put certain animals on a pedestal because we have an affinity towards them is rank hypocrisy for everyone except strict vegans (and arguably vegetarians to a lesser extent), since they can at least say that they don't like eating any animal product or meat as a matter of principle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They have in effect opted themselves out of those laws by refusing to accept the ICJ (International Court of Justice)'s legitimacy in going after them for it.    
There is also the question of the legitimacy of anti-whaling laws as they pertain to this. It may seem an odd criticism, considering how hilariously bad Japan's facade of research is, but the Minke whales they are going after are not endangered. That totally undermines the anti-whalers' position that they have some legitimate claim to stop Japan's whaling.   
If it is, as one could be forgiven for assuming, more about blind affinity for certain animals (the same reason that people complain about dogs being killed and eaten, above and beyond making sure that they are killed humanely (a different, but still important issue)), then the anti-whalers should admit that, but that is hardly a legitimate basis for international law or for prosecuting a country. </TEXT>

In all seriousness though. This really makes it a better choice in some cases IMO to withhold the truth from the FAA if not outright lie to them.
