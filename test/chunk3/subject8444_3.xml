	<TEXT> Okay this is what I think is being said (based off OP) you want to know how STO compares to other MMORPG/MOBA based on active readers in English speaking countries.

What the rest of us are trying to figure out is what does active reader have to do with anything? 

Basing a user population by who reads/comments on a Reddit makes a lot of major assumptions that may or may not be true. You have to make the assumption that all players are also subscribers (if not what is your percentage of players that are also on reddit) now you have to assume those same numbers hold for all the other titles listed. The list of assumptions would keep going. With so many assumptions the conclusion that is reached would carry little if any weight.

I read and comment on a daily basis (at least the reading part, I try not to comment unless I can add something), but I have never subscribed as there is like two reddits I check out. Therefore your numbers are inaccurate by at least one (I can't be the only one).

So my take is your numbers could be way off as active readers don't tell much (Do they only count subscribers? Or is it anyone that is on the page at the time? Do they have to be in a thread? What if they have multiple threads open in multiple tabs do those all register individual, or is it by IP address. I remember several years back they use to fuzz up numbers for reddits with less than 100 active online is that still a thing?)

Point is one set of data point doors not mean anything. Looking at the traffic stats for r/sto there are on average about 7000 unique visits a day with about 40000 page views a day. So looking at a snapahot or not, you aren't really saying anything. If you are looking for popularity of games I think active readers is inaccurate. Maybe unique visits would be a better metric. 

Example STO unique visits daily average 7000. WoW 257,000.

As you really haven't defined what it is that you have set out to do by sharing this data, it is understandable why people are charitably interpreting what is being presented. Instead of dismissing other people's interpretation, maybe you should expand on what you are being presented with.

TL;DR you really had no point with your data. If I have to explain why just read above. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My understanding of what you are saying (based on your OP) is you wanted to see if the popularity of a game reflected in the number of active reader. What I think everyone else is asking is "how does active readers indicate anything?"

Furthermore, I actively read and comment and have never subscribed, so these numbers could be way off.

	<TEXT> If you like to tank I would recommend a cruiser or a science ship. Science trends to give you enough powers to play around for buff/debuff or heal/repel damage to keep you in the game. Cruisers tend to have more hull and focus on engineering traits for a bunch of heals and boosts. Are you looking to stick with Fed ships only? I'm a fed tac in an avenger (T5-U) and love it. I know you are looking at T6 but wanted to point out that maybe look at one tier ships until a T6 of your liking comes along. Another possibility is going through lock boxes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm on xbox, but I guess this is a general question. Is there a way to change gender of a toon? I really like my current toon, but want to change the gender for the sake of change and aesthetics.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the replies. Shame. I guess I'm spend my time modifying my toons face. I wish they would do something similar to EA's game face. Where you can take pictures of your face and use it in game. Anyone have tips on face creation. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have two consoles that are same mark and rarity but I've increases weapon power (WepPwr) and the other increases power transfer (EPS). In a Avenger running all beams (am considering switch on forward slot for the Crystal torp) what will help with dealing damage?

My understanding is that higher weapon power means each beam can cause more damage, where power transfer help with keeping weapon power "charged" so it deals more damage.

Is there a set consensus on which is better? </TEXT>

I'm currently in an avenger (T5-U) and running full beams and a bunch of hull and shield heals Tac Team x2, engineering team, emergency power to structural integrity, science team, couple of attack patterns (alpha and omega), feedback pulse (I still not sure how to best utilize this, do any advice would be appreciated). I think most importantly for me is reverse shield polarity. Don't know if that helps at all, but I'd love to see your setup. </TEXT>
