	<TEXT> Aww, thanks. 

I usually do what you do but there are a few who absolutely will not let go. The 14 year one I have not seen in over 10 years and she still likes every single one of my fb posts within 5 seconds. She also chats with me at least once a week on fb and calls me about twice a month. She's tenacious, I'll give her that. We live in the same city.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for all your kind words! It's nice to know I'm not going crazy. When I subbed on here before he left, I thought "This is silly, I'm not going to need support for 14 weeks." I was so wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also don't have a lot of advice. I'm totally talking out my ass, and I don't want to piss anyone off, but my boyfriend and I lived together over two years before he left and it has been HARD. I was in an LDR for six months in college and the bf I had (at the time) and I had never lived together, and it felt nothing close to this. Maybe that's because I didn't love him nearly as much as my current SO. Like I said, I really don't know, but this has been much harder than I expected. And then I see all these champs on here going years without seeing their SOs and I wonder if it's because they never lived together, or that I'm a total dramatic pansy. I'm not really jealous, but I am extremely clingy like you and my bf is my best friend. 

You have an end date and you are crazy about one another and you can see your bf twice a month (ideally). Just know it's going to flippin' SUCK, but you are going to be alright. I'm five wees into my distance so I'm just trying to figure it out as I go. I get to see him once in 5 more wees and then he has another 6 weeks before he comes home, so my time isn't as long as yours, but I'm seeing him a lot less. I'm fine but I have days where I'm a damn mess. 

How did you guys meet? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been five weeks. I'm just a baby. I don't know how you all do it. After living together for over two years, I guess I'm just don't remember how to be happy without him. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not a total depressed zombie. I'm staying productive and functional. I still laugh every day. It just feel this ever growing hole in my chest. 

Last night I had a super-vivid dream that lasted almost all night where he was just holding me and like, petting my hair. When I woke up this morning I reached for him and it broke my heart when I realized he was still gone. I wouldn't trade that dream for anything in the world, but it still totally wrecked me. I had a super short talk with him on the phone today, which I made up an excuse to end early because I couldn't keep it together. There's nothing he can do about the distance so I don't see the point in making him worry about me. As soon as he was off the line I had a total crying breakdown and hugged the dog. This is the first time I think I've totally lost it. Our 3 year anniversary it tomorrow. Had to end my crying-shesh early cause my daughter came in the room, but I feel a lot better now. This just sucks so hard. I miss him.

	<TEXT> I'm 27.

I feel old at times. I never really say "I'M OLD!" In any seriousness. Maybe I've said it on the internet but not seriously. I absolutely *feel* old, but I know that's because I've had a very hard life so far. I'm tired and I like/relate to older people much more than the average person my age. I know I'm not actually old though and I'm rather positive and hope all the hard shit is behind me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Extremely similar. The longer we are together the more similar we become, but after dating a few weeks we were already finishing each other's sentences. I think I must have laughed till my sides split on our first date and he was the same way. Our sense of humor plays perfectly off of one another and laughing is very important to us. 

He's ten years older than me so the few things we don't see eye to eye on, often has to do with the age gap. Usually we are in the same ballpark but not in total agreement about stuff like that. Like, I want to take a pole dancing workout class and he can't shake the feeling that it's a bit provocative, but I think he's just more old-school. 

He's at master gunner school right now. One month down, about 2.5 to go. I feel like my arm has been ripped off.  </TEXT>

I think looks-wise I'm out of my boyfriends league. Writing that out makes me feel like a total bitch though. I could not give two shits about being more attractive than he is. Success-wise, he is out of my league. I have an equal trajectory as he does but he's 10 years older than me so he is further along in his success. 

The dude loved me at 270 lbs, so he sure as hell deserves me at 140. I love him more than a fat kid loves cake, and I'd know, I've done the research.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a graduate student as a teacher one year. At the end of the semester we did our evaluations. 

My big issue with was is that she would make us take tests BEFORE she lectured on the content. This was her way of making sure everyone was reading the text. Still, it was complicated stuff. I was a really good student in that class and I did well. Still, I thought her method was total crap. At the end of the year on the eval I wrote "If I can pass the test without you, why do I need you?" The next day my quote was written on the board and she spent like 15 min of class time lecturing us about being rude and how we won't take responsibility for our own learning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not as bad as your situation, but my bf is in the military also. The month before he left our schedules were insanely hectic. They were having him pull staff duty constantly (24 hour shifts) and then to top it all off, they made him go out into the field for two weeks before he was to depart for master-gunner school (a 14 week leave). 

It basically narrowed down to us having one night to ourselves the night before he had to leave for master-gunner school. We were texting flirtatiously all day. 4pm rolls around and for god-knows-what-reason my period started a week early. I was so mad. So now instead of 14 weeks without sex, it's 18.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boyfriend and I have lived together for three years. He is in the army. Thankfully, his MOS is non-deployable so I've never had to deal with one of those. Several times a year he does have to test equipment, but he is never gone for more than three weeks. 

Three weeks ago he left for master gunner school. Three weeks down, 11 to go. Man, how do you guys do it? This sucks so hard and it has not even really *begun* for me. If I'm this lonely now, what is going to happen in 11 more weeks? Will I numb up or am I in for hell? This guy has been a fixture in my life for three years and now he's gone, I feel empty. 

I am trying to stay productive. I Launch myself into my work and hobbies. Still, I don't enjoy them. Before, I did my hobbies because I wanted to. Now any task I do is done with the mindset of "Alright how much time will this kill for me until my bf gets home?" All tasks are that way. They just feel like I'm trying to kill time. Just running through the motions.

 *Cleaning the house takes two hours. Only 2,112 hours to go!* 

*Exercise for one hour? Only 2,111 hours to go!*

I feel like I'm trying to kill time in a doctor's waiting room in hell. People tell me "Everything is going to be okay" and they are right. Absolutely. I know we won't break up. I know he will be back. I know he loves me and we will get through this. Everything is going to be okay... but right now, I'm not.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After baking bread for YEARS, last week I made a loaf of french and forgot to add salt. I took a big bite into it an was immediately thinking "what does this bread taste like nothing? It's like the water of foods!" I had no idea that the flavor of bread 100% depends on salt. 

EDIT: Also I have a question. I could be totally crazy, but to me, if there is not enough salt in a dish, it's super bland, even if all the other spices were added. What is it about salt that seems to amplify other flavors that are not salt? Does salt act as some kind of catalyst to flavor? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Smeat

My mom is a really good cook. I mean really good. Like, neighborhood kids were always trying to get invited to dinner good. Still, she has had a few epic blunders in her day. After learning that people ate mint with lamb, she decided to try and recreate a mint-lamb recipe with beef. It ended up tasting weird to her and she thought putting sugar in it would help (I have no idea why, I'm still at a loss for why she did that.) She made it way worse. 

See, my mom grew up in Africa (Liberia) as a missionary kid. She saw kids starve to death so NO FOOD was EVER thrown away or wasted in our home. The "smeat" (sweet meat) as we called it was inedible, but she kept sneaking it into other dishes and ruining them. It took forever to have a decent tasting meal because she kept claiming to have gotten rid of the smeat and then it would show up again hidden inside something. 

To this day if something tastes  or smells weird we ask "is there smeat in this?" It's basically become our term for anything that seems off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm bisexual. I guess. I lean more towards liking men. I find women very physically attractive and have slept with them but I've never fallen in love with a woman. I know this seems weird, but it was always a big turn off for me when a guy I was dating told me that it was alright if I slept with women on the side. (even though I never did)

Now that I'm nearing 30 it has not happened as often, but it happened A LOT in college, and I get that. People like to experiment, whatever. Still, I had several serious relationships where the man would tell me I could sleep with other women and it bugged me. I'm monogamous. It's just who I am. I like to be with other monogamists. When they would encourage me to sleep with other women it made me feel less valuable to them. Like I didn't matter. It also made me feel like they didn't take my sexuality seriously. Bisexual women are often seen as some sort of party trick. It was even worse for me because I liked men more, so I got accused of being "Katy Perry gay" a lot. As if it was a show. I spent a lot of my time in college utterly confused about my sexuality and society didn't make it any easier. 

The guy I am with now (and intend to marry) would be just as mad at me if he found me in bed with a woman as he would with a man. This makes me feel special and important as well as lets me know that he takes my sexuality seriously. 

There are tons of strait/bi/gay polyamorous people out there and I 100% support their life choices. It's just not for me or my partner. It would bug me when I was with a guy who claimed to be monogamous (which is what I want) who would then turn around and encourage me to sleep with women. Like the sex "didn't count". It counts. Gay sex is just as valid as strait sex. 

EDIT: In retrospect this sounds like a big thing, but when I was in those relationships it wasn't. It would be brought up once or twice and then dropped. It just always bothered me that they asked.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a really small cloth satchel with grocery bags in it. Right now I'm keeping the BMs my dogs have in there (double bagged and sealed in the grocery bags obviously) but the damn thing gets in my way a lot. It's not really a *huge* deal, but it's mildly annoying and I was wondering if there was a better way. I don't want to run while holding the bag because the poop bouncing and hitting my hand (even though it's through the bag) grosses me out. Also I can smell it if I'm holding it, whereas if it's in the satchel I cant because it's behind me. 

I'm sorry, i know this thread is totally ridiculous, but I could use some tips.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved pink as a kid. Hot pink. Sadly I was a tomboy so after about the age of five, I kept it a secrete. 

Now my favorite colors have a lot more to do with what colors I look good in. I'm a redhead, so I wear a lot of green. Black looks good also and teal. I can't wear pink because it looks terrible on red-heads, but I wouldn't *want* to wear it either. 

So basically my favorite color changed from the one I found most visually pleasing, to the one I look best dressed in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a five year old and my boyfriend has an eight year old. Both girls. He is in the military and his daughter lives pretty far away from him. We plan to move to the same city as her when he gets out in two years. 

My boyfriend and I have lived together for over two years. My daughter's dad is not in her life and my boyfriend has taken over that role. He loves her like his own. Still, when *his* daughter comes to visit (twice a year for 1-2 weeks a year) I always get this overwhelming sense of guilt. 

His daughter is amazing, well behaved, smart, beautiful etc, and whenever she visits I show her tons of love and attention. She loves me. Still, secretly (and I have told my bf) I feel guilty because I don't *love* her yet. I really want to, and I really like her, but I have not gotten to that point yet and it makes me feel bad because he loves my daughter like his own. 

He thinks I will learn to love her once we move and I get to see her on a regular basis. I think he is right. Just right now it feels bad because I'm picking favorites.   </TEXT>

Maybe I am an idealist, but I always got the impression that most of my teachers did not posses the ability to speak negatively and non-constructively about their students. 

It doesn't even ping on my radar now. Teachers are just people. Just like you and I. They bitch about their jobs just as much as the rest of us. The only difference is that their jobs are your children.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I drive 5 mph over the speed limit and never stay in the passing lane. The guy in question was flooring it and weaving recklessly through traffic. It wasn't just me he cut off, he was weaving back and forth between lanes every 5 seconds, dodging cars so close that some of them had to break to keep from rear ending him as he changed lanes. If he hit someone he could have killed them. 

I'm not saying the guy deserves the death penalty or anything, It was just satisfying seeing him getting forced to stop.

EDIT: Also, my motto is, don't drive politely, drive correctly. I would never fuck with the rules of who has the right-of-way, it's dangerous. You don't know me or what sort of driver I am, but it's nice to know your knee-jerk reaction to a story about a guy going double the speed limit, is to immediately take his side.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Taking things one day at a time when you are starting a diet is important. Heck, lifestyle changes don't happen overnight. Still, if you are anything like me, when you mess up and eat a big lunch, you think "Screw it! Do over! Mulligan! I'll start again tomorrow!" and you over-eat the rest of the day. 

This might not be the best advice for people who are just starting or are totally new to weight loss, but I find holding myself accountable for the week's calories helps me not turn one screw up, into a total cluster-****. It also allows you some wiggle room through your week. Going out to eat with family? Maybe you can knock 50-100 calories off your daily budget for the rest of the week. This also really helps me not beat myself up after a mistake. Sure, 500 extra calories will screw up your day, but will it screw up your week? Not so much. It makes me feel less guilty when I do make mistakes. It's all about the big picture.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugggg everything...

Ever since I was about 13 I started saying "I'm a woman, not a lady." I made my friends call me Max for almost two years from the ages of 7-8. I suppose I'm quite a bit more lady-like now, but I still feel far less lady-like than society thinks I should be.

I used to get spanked every sunday when I was a kid for running my stockings, and it was all downhill from there. I like dirty jokes and I was always the one chasing boys when I was single. I like hanging out in sweatpants if I don't have to go anywhere. I like power-lifting. I have a higher than normal sex drive. I've tried to wear fake nails like five times an they never last more than half the day before i'm desperately trying to rip them off. 

I don't know, I always thought "being a lady" looked really boring. Now I'm beginning to see that we decide what it really means to be one. That and I really enjoy every once and a while getting really primped up and dressed to the nines an making jaws hit the floor. I clean up well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, so I'm going to try and be as honest as possible so I can get some real advice. 

I'm really co-dependent. I consider myself an extrovert (I guess?) because I hate being alone and I love to socialize, but it seems that when I am in serious relationships, I want to spend all my free time with my SO. I'm 27 years old now and I've been in quite a few long term relationships, so I know myself well and that's how I am. 
My current SO has encouraged me to branch out and make/have other friends besides him, so luckily, this is one of the few times in my life that I have 2-3 close friends along with having a boyfriend. My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and we (and my five year old daughter) have all lived together for a little over two years. He is in the army and I am self-employed as a writer. My boyfriend is 37. 

Well he is getting sent off to master gunner school in a little less than three weeks and I am shitting my pants. He will be gone for 15-16 weeks to Georgia (I'm in Texas). I keep telling him everything will be fine and not to worry (and I'm sure it will in the big picture) but I'm not sure if he knows just how brutal this is going to be. I really don't see a point in telling him either. He has to go either way and I don't want him to worry more than he most likely already is. I'm currently struggling with an eating disorder that has resurfaced this year, and although I've made great progress and feel pretty stable, it still freaks me out a bit. That and now having a job where I don't have to leave home or interact with anyone... it just feels like it would be way to easy for me to curl up in a hole and completely separate myself from the world. 

What can I do to make this as painless as possible? Give me all your advice.  </TEXT>

I hate cardio so much that the only way I can get through it is to play games on my phone while I'm on the bike or the elliptical or speed-walking on the treadmill at a high incline (I tried to play while actually running but it doesn't work out well. I ended up kicking my purse and it fell on the belt and I tripped over it.)

	<TEXT> THE BAD

I have severe dyslexia and couldn't read until 3rd grade. I was raised in a religious cult, got out, got knocked up at 20, married the guy who turned out to be horrendously abusive, developed an eating disorder, lost 110 lbs (I needed to lose weight, but not that way)...

WHAT I DID WITH IT

Left said husband, went into recovery for ED, gained all the weight I lost back and then lost 130 lbs in a HEALTHY way, got into college, graduated with a degree in English, got into graduate school, Almost done with a 3.5 GPA, got a book published, met a wonderful man I am going to marry who is a wonderful father to my daughter. I am hoping to start my career as a SPED teacher working with dyslexic kids the in the next two years. (I turned 27 this past February. I'm hoping the rest of my life is far less eventful.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! And the same goes for you as well. Anyone is physically capable of losing weight (barring extreme circumstances). If you look at the bare bones of "how to" lose weight, anyone is capable of completing the tasks required.  It's almost entirely psychological whether we succeed at it or not. I feel like that part of it is often severely underplayed. 

I wish you all the best. You have one thing many people on here don't. You have lost weight before (and a significant amount), so you know you are capable of doing it. :) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am writing this for those of you that may have experienced what I have. Everyone is different. What is true for me might not be true for you, but some parts or all might ring true and I'm hoping I can help others who are experiencing the same sort of thoughts and feelings as I do. 

As many of you who have flowed me know, I suffer from bulimia, and have for many years now. I've been struggling a bit recently and have had to go back to therapy and re-examine my feelings and emotions. Without going into too much detail, I'd like to take this opportunity to use writing to help myself understand exactly what's going on in my head, as well as share with others who might recognize like-thoughts or feelings in their own lives, as a way to possibly help them stop this harmful way of living.

 In a way, this is specifically aimed at those of you who have been fat your entire lives, the way that I have. Anyway, I hope this helps. 

My whole life growing up, I was often told You are so beautiful, but... and I always knew what was going to come after that. But if you would lose a little bit of weight, you would be gorgeous. But you are fat. But you need to lose weight. My parents always praised me strongly academically. They always told me I was smart and capable. On top of that I was funny and kind. My mother can still, to this day, talk forever about how kind I am and what a sweet child I was. I believe this was the beginning of my dissociation. Everything good about myself was inside of me. The essence of who I was as a person. My personality, my logic, my brain. Everything negative that I experienced was tied to my physical body.

 If it was my first day of school and I felt nervous or insecure, it was because I was fat. If a boy rejected me, it was because I was fat. None of those feelings are entirely uncommon or hard to understand. Still, as I kept reinforcing this thought pattern, it lead to my mind making bigger leaps that might not make as much sense to the average person. If I was feeling fear or stress or overwhelmed, I began associating them with the same place I filed everything negative, my body. This was compounded for me, growing up, by my parents joining a religious cult when I was 12 years old until I was 17. I was put in an environment where all of my emotions were accosted and stifled and bad so they got filed right along with the same place I put all other bad things, my body. Not only that, but I glorified the other half of me. I thought I was SO SMART. I thought I was SO FUNNY. I thought I was SO NICE and SO KIND. If someone didn't like me because of something I said or did (and made it clear it had nothing to do with my body) I absolutely could not let it go. How dare they not like my personality or my mind. They are perfect. 

This was when I began feeling like there were two separate people (figuratively) living in my head. There was the physical body that eats and screams and cries and is terrified and wild. It was everything about myself that I had categorized as bad. Then there was the good side of me. It was the side that was kind and smart and loving and funny. The perfect one. 

Then, in 2009, I found myself in another traumatic situation. I was in a super abusive marriage and I had just given birth to a child who didn't deserve to be raised in that environment. But who would love me? I was convinced nobody would. Hell, even I didn't love me. Still, I loved my daughter. If I could not do it for myself, surely I could do it for her. Through diet and exercise I began to try and completely eliminate the bad one from my life and set out on a starvation diet that would completely rid me from her once and for all. Then I could find a good man to love me because god knows, I couldn't take care of myself! As I got smaller and smaller (I lost 110 lbs in 9 months) the weight-loss slowed. I was so desperate to get out I started starving more and more. Still, the bad part of me didn't go away. I could never exercise or starve her away, so I tried harder. Eventually she would come roaring out and, being the physical being she was, would get drunk and cry and eat everything in the house. Then when she calmed down the perfect and logical one would come in a judge me for letting her out and I felt the only way I can fix this was to make myself vomit. 
	

So I ended up in the hospital having to have emergency surgery to save my life due to my aggressive bulimia. At that point I had left my husband and he was out of the picture. I was all my daughter had left. I could not let myself die. It scared me enough to go into recovery where I stopped purging but kept binging and gained almost all my weight back. Then I went on the long and difficult process of losing it all over again and then some. 

Lots of people ask me how one gets an ED. Well, that's how I got mine, and it sucks. Every day I struggle between these two opposing forces, trying to smoosh them back together into one person. The wild and out of control emotional animal and the hyper-controlling one that strives for perfection. 

I see many of you on here who have lost weight that are terrified of getting fat again. Many of you, I have seen panic so hard that you will go on crash diets that result in equally extreme binges. Then you get upset because you still can't lose weight. Or maybe you can lose weight, but you can't keep it off. The trick to true healthy and sustainable weight-loss is to strive to accept every part of yourself. The harder you try and eliminate or run away from parts of you, the more it will chase you and haunt you for the rest of your life. You must deal and learn to love every part of you before you can move the entire you (every part) towards a healthy life. Also, realize that not all your problems are from fat. Sounds silly, but I hear it a lot from people. 
	

Skinny people have problems too. Beautiful people have problems too. Rich people have problems too. The more you associate your problems with your fat, the more messed up in the head you are going to be when this is all over. If you think you are bad with people because you are fat, and then you lose weight, and you embarrass yourself at a job interview, you are going to feel fat, and if your brain is wired in just a certain way, you might end up being one of the unlucky ones who thinks losing another ten lbs will fix your problems. Maybe you can't lose another ten and you end up going on a crash diet and then binging and purging. Or maybe you can and you are then still bad with people, so you lose another ten and another... Either way, just please know that your weight is just one aspect of you. 


Losing weight can do fantastic things. It's done SO MANY great things for me. Still, when I see on here, people berating themselves and using negativity to fuel their weight loss it breaks my heart. Self esteem is not something you can just check at the door and then pick up on your way out once you are at your goal weight. It's a life-long struggle and the sooner you get to loving yourself, the better, no matter your size. 

EDIT: Holy crap! Thank you for the gold. I'm honored really. This community is so kind.

	<TEXT> As a coping mechanism I have disassociated my body/feelings from... myself? The rest of me? That sounds crazier than it is. It just feels like my feelings and my logic are two different people who don't agree a lot and it has specifically focused on my body. 

As a result I'm always having to fight my eating disorder. I feel like if I could push those two opposing forces back into one person a lot of my issues would be solved. 

Like for example, I can look at my body in a mirror and know logically that I am not fat and that I am fit and that I am attractive, but I *feel* very negative towards my body and wish for it to be as small as possible because I just want it to go away. Not *just* my body, but all the negative things about myself that I associate with it (some of them, things normal people would not even associate with their body, like if I feel insecure, I think of it as "feeling fat"). At the same time when I experience something stressful, I retreat into my physical body and comfort myself by over-eating and escape from the logical part of me. Then when she shows up and reprimands me for what I've done I feel like vomiting is my only way to make it better. 

Actually writing that out has helped me understand it a bit better myself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I was in middleschool (I was fat since I was like six or seven) when I first started incorporating exercise into my weight-loss attempts. I remember doing what I thought was an INSANE amount of work on my parent's exercise bike, only to look down and realize I had burnt around 300 calories. Sometime later I ate a burger that came out at 500 calories (I discovered after the fact) and I cried. It was so much easier to eat 500 calories than it was to burn 300 exercising. 

I have met quite a few people who have lost over 50 lbs through diet alone. I still, as of yet, have to meet one who lost over 50 with exercise alone and no dietary changes whatsoever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many say suicide is selfish. I think that the people who think that, are selfish. It takes an incredible amount of misery to seriously consider killing yourself. I've been through HELL, absolute and total HELL, and I've NEVER seriously, *seriously* considered killing myself. I can't fathom what it would take to actually do it. 

People say suicide is selfish because it hurts everyone around the person. I say it's selfish to resent someone who was in so much pain they killed themselves to make it stop. Maybe everything isn't about you, maybe it's about *them*. Now murder, that's fucking selfish. 

EDIT: For clarity, I don't condone suicide. Ideally these people would get help. Still, resenting someone for killing themselves is mind-boggling to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean this with to malice. I realize tone does not translate well over text, so believe me when I say I mean this as gently as possible...

You just described a very sad sounding situation. You yourself said several times how sad you are. We go through the story seeing you become more and more repressed and sad and how your wife's LL hurt and affected you.... and then at the end you say "LL partner should not have to change their ways."

So you tried it her way and now you are sad and miserable. Now her way is your way and you are causing her to be sad and miserable. At what point do you think you will re-think your strategy? It's obviously not working, and at this point, you sound resigned to stick to it. You say the LL should not change. She didn't change when she was the LL and you were miserable. Now you are the LL not changing and you are both miserable. Great, so why do you still think this is the solution?

I know you say through the whole story that you have always had your wife's best interests and feelings in mind, and you did this all for her, but then at the end you say "And now that she would want it... why should it be any different to her than it was for me?" it makes it sound like you are getting even. Sex should not be used as a weapon. What she did to you was wrong, and I am so sorry about all the pain you must be feeling, but trying to punish her for what she did is not going to fix this. 

You mark the times you have talked about this with *years* in between. years! I talk about this with my SO at least once a month and if we are going through a particular dry spell, once a week at least! This is a big beast to try and tackle and you are going to get it done a lot more effectively if you form a strategy together instead of playing a yearly game of battleship in the dark.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree to a point, but the difference between someone saying "no hot water" or "no cheese" and saying "no sex" is the need for the other person's participation to have sex. Whereas eating cheese or taking a hot shower is a personal experience, having sex is a shared one and forcing someone to have sex when they don't want to can be just as hostile as not having sex with someone who wants to have it. 

If my SO were withholding with the express intent on hurting me, and not because of lack of desire/medical issues/etc, then yes, I 100% agree, but I don't think that is the case for everyone and motivation is a huge factor.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for taking the time to write all that. This is exactly what I was looking for. Someone to give me perspective. I will talk to him about the books, that is a great idea. You did a great job of helping me pinpoint why it's so hurtful when I'm not having sex. It's not just the sexual desire itself, it's the feeling of him not caring about my emotions. 

As dumb at it is, the *way* you said all of this was so important to me. Usually I am able to separate the nuggets of knowledge from the way people say them, but I'm also introspective enough to know that I'm *super* sensitive about this subject and I am going to shut down if I feel attacked.  There is no way for me to separate such volatile emotions from logic with this and I realize that. I hate to be the person who needs everything in a candy-coating (and usually I'm not) but I feel like the sub would benefit from some sensitivity training. You could be the most right person on the planet but if you deliver all your wisdom in douche-wrapping, some of it is going to fall through the cracks. 

Anyway, rant off. Thank you so much for your response.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your sincere concern and heartfelt response. I see where you are coming from and it's definitely given me a lot to think about. 

I'm so in love and everything but this really seems to me to be going so well, I just can't dream of leaving right now. Maybe if things get worse and worse, and other things start going wrong over years and years it could get to that point, but I don't see being able to leave unless things got bad and our relationship as a whole is not bad. Also, if he ever asked me to sleep with other men, I would be furious, so I totally get where you are coming from on that. He would never do that.

Even if you're right and my relationship is doomed, I can't leave. I won't kow it's doomed until I get to that point. I have to try and fix this. I have to try. I'm here because I want to try, I'm not here to have people telling me over and over again to leave because I'm not going to. I can't prove it but everything else is REALLY good. He's a wonderful man and father. I seriously doodle his name in the margins of my notebooks and he still gives me butterflies when we kiss. He brings me flowers for no reason and when he's out at the store, he sees things he thinks I will like or need and gets them for me without me even asking. It's not about the stuff, I've just never had anyone who cared so much about me and thought about me and my needs. 

He's helped me through my eating disorder and my PTSD with past childhood abuse and he was there when my daughter was in the hospital and almost died and he loved me when I was 270 lbs and he loves me now at 140 lbs. He is my rock. He keeps me level. He sits up at night when I can't sleep due to anxiety and he has never done anything malicious or intentionally to hurt me. If I left I feel like it would be the biggest mistake of my life and if I am making a mistake (which I truly think I'm not) then I'm going to make it and I just wanted advice on how people make it work and what has helped.  Tips. Tricks. Hard fast rules. Do's and don't's. That's why I put in the original  post "I'm not leaving."  </TEXT>

EDIT: I am reading a lot of other threads in this forum and the amount of comments that jump right to "dump him/her" is upsetting. This seems like a pretty bitter and jaded place. I for one, believe that relationships require work. Not an insane amount to the point of being miserable, but you will never find someone who is 100% completely effortless.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, that is far more helpful than just calling me a liar and walking away. Yes, sex is a huge part of a relationship. I agree. It's important. If it was not important I would not be here. 

Still in terms like "otherwise perfect" and "every other way", the word "other" is used as an exclusionary indicator separating the sexual part of the relationship from the other parts. When you say that having a sex issue takes a relationship far from "otherwise perfect" it doesn't make sense because I'm specifically saying "the parts other than sex" are perfect. Is my relationship perfect as a whole? NOPE. Sex is a big deal to me. 

Should I not use the word perfect? Most likely. You're right. I should not generalize. Everything else is very good. Happy?  Want to keep arguing semantics?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. 

To be fair, I had been in two abusive relationships before I met him so I was really skiddish. We started hanging out a lot and sleeping together casually, but I made it very clear to him that i did not want a relationship.  I made it a point to try and play the field, but every time I had a date coming up, I always ended up canceling it because I wanted to just go to his house and watch netflix. Eventually I realized that if I was just going to blow off other guys to be with him, he might as well be my boyfriend. Good thing too, cause I guess he was just about to cut me off because he was falling for me and didn't want to get hurt by my seeming lack of feelings for him.

We've been together 3 years and we're crazy about each other.   </TEXT>

Tell me, did I break some sort of rule that's not listed in the side-bar? If you feel like I'm missing out on something, why don't you clue me in instead of making cryptic hints? 

Different people respond to things differently and you don't know me, so let me tell you something about me. I crazy sensitive and coming in at me with a hard line, accusing me of being a liar is not how you are going to get me to listen to what you have to say. I'm not saying I want you to sugar-coat things, but you don't have to "go in dry". I'm an emotional wreck right now and I'm laying it all out there for support as best I know how and I feel like you are grabbing salt. Show some sensitivity? 

There's a great way to get your point across without coming off like you are being mean. You might be right, you might be wrong, but if you intend to keep coming at me in this way I wont get anything from it. If I don't get anything from it you are wasting your time and I am here because I need help. So please (and I mean this with kindness and sincerity since you can't hear my tone) either be gentler with me (you can still get your point across) or leave, because calling me a liar and leaving a one-liner is not going to help.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This text makes him look particularly bad. We talk about everything. All I have said has been said to him over and over again and I think he has run out of things to say. My last marriage ended because my husband was completely cold and would not talk about anything. Funny though, he always wanted to have sex. This guy I've been with for 3 years is amazing in every way except with sex. We talk about everything, we are very openly affectionate and I know he loves me with all his heart, I can feel it. When we do have sex it's always amazing.

I'm just a total love/attention vacuum and no amount makes me feel satisfied unless he is holding me and telling me how much he loves me 24/7 and I realize it's unfair. I've asked him to get his testosterone checked and he refuses because he is a "army guy man's man" type, and I'm not sure, but he's 10 years older than me and I feel like that might be a generational thing. He won't go to therapy for the same reason. 

So he's tried of fighting about it and so am I, I guess. We never fight except about this, and its only once every few months, but it's always a big one when it happens. We both hate fighting and it's just not worth it when nothing changes.  </TEXT>
