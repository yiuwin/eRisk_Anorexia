	<TEXT> reaching for my iced skinny vanilla latte($5.40) I almost drank from acetone nail polish remover($3.99) because I was painting my nails with Essie nail polish($9.49). All while wearing an outfit where the skirt alone cost over 100 bucks. Clearly spoiled white girl.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had laser surgery(well, I don't know if surgery is the right word but they did use lasers) to remove the scars on my arms and legs from self harm. I was sick of people going "omg, what happened to you?" It really helped me get over my past, and made it possible to wear short sleeves and shorts again. In short, it really helped me. </TEXT>
