	<TEXT> If you are hard set on committing suicide and end up doing that. Don't do it in your house. Your family would never recover from such a horrible experience. They will be scarred no matter what. But finding your body would be even more cruel. A friend of mine committed suicide in high school a couple of years back and his family will never truly recover. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry. That really sucks. I suppose the best advice is "find better friends". But that's kind of cliched and difficult. Were you planning on going to college or something else before deciding on suicide?

I hope you don't mind me asking all these questions. You see, I'm curious, I like to get to know people. Plus, most devious of all, I'd kind of like to convince you to give life another chance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That makes sense. You mentioned your family coming home. Am I to assume you are still living at home? Are you at all worried how your family will feel? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I'm glad you're doing this AMA. It's possible people here can help you make the right decision with your life.

Why do you think they're sacrificing their free time? What if these people truly enjoy spending time with you?

One of the reasons I'm talking right now, and one of the reasons I'm so afraid, is because you remind me of a very good friend of mine. She has been severely depressed for a long time and has talked of suicide. I also know that she has felt like a burden on myself and my friends anytime she's had to stay at our place, or broke down in front of us. I'm always terrified that she'll think we don't enjoy spending time with her. The truth is we love spending time with her and I've never judged or felt mad when she needs to spend more time than is "convenient".

Do you think it's at all possible that your situation is like that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd advice against it. Why do you feel the need to? Also why are you doing an AMA? I am not discouraging you from doing the AMA, I'm just curious what you're here for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. The good thing is she's still a wonderful friend. So in all honesty my weekend really hasn't been that bad. In retrospect it'll be fine. Hopefully your week won't seem quite so bad in the future. Even terrible occurrences can sometimes fade a bit with time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That does indeed sound icky.

My weekend was bad because I just found out my crush thinks I only like her for her body. And I didn't even find out because I had the guts to ask her out, instead a friend told me she said this. So now I have the dilemma of no actual rejection, but knowing I may ruin our friendship if I act.

Sounds petty in comparison to your week, but I'm still pretty cut-up about it. </TEXT>

Hopefully everything works out at work.
