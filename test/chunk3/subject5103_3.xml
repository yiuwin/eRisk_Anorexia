Like a poster said below, getting the media involved could be helpful. Maybe even just social media... You could post the pictures on your wall and on the wall's of local institutions/officials in your area. It's hard for officers/officials/institutions to ignore something that is shared in the public eye and scrutinized by the people they service/represent... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it's tempting to "do it on the low" and I've seen many people do it that way, but it's never a good idea.

If the landlord finds out that people are living there that they don't know, the consequences could be severe.

0 out of 0 times I would recommend doing it this way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be a real estate agent in Boston. If I remember correctly, especially when co-signers are included, the landlord will go after all the parties involved jointly. In other words, it is not his responsibility to just go after the parties not paying. You are all equally and jointly bound.

That being said, the best thing to do is communicate all of this to your landlord right away. Most "reasonable" landlords will respect that you are still paying/honoring your contract and attempt to resolve the issue with the other parties. 

In the meantime you should also get his approval to put an ad on craigslist for the rooms opening up. This is called a sublet and essentially the new people will sign a sublet contract through your landlord that says they are taking over the lease for the other tenants who are moving out.

Again, I'm a bit rusty but the best thing you can do here is be proactive about the whole situation. The landlord has a right to go after you as part of the lease potentially being broken - so if you get on their good side, you might be OK here.

Lastly, talk to the agent you worked with as well. They could potentially make more money by re-renting the rooms be vacated so they might see helping you as an opportunity to make more money on an apartment that they already know and had success with.

Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there anywhere you go to in public where you feel more "normal" than places you go during your daily routine? For example, in Deuce Bigalow (I know, terrible movie) the woman with tourettes was loved at a baseball stadium because he kept swearing... and people thought he was jeering the umpires. Wondering if there any scenarios like this for you?

	<TEXT> I often think about this as I walk through where I live, South Boston, which is now Yuppieville but used to be home to some of the most violent criminals in the country including James "Whitey" Bulger.

It was discovered that Whitey [buried bodies in unfinished basements](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/09/us-usa-crime-bulger-idUSBRE9680GP20130709), parks, marshlands and "beaches" in   around Southie - I wonder how many are left.

	<TEXT> I actually enjoyed your cynical outlook on the future of these gifts. Reminds me of a stand up I saw recently (I think Bill Burr) where he said everything we buy is in sort of just in a temporary state waiting to become trash.

All of that being said, while I appreciated your effort, you are missing the big points here.

1. They are a nostalgic piece that is a great conversation starter. They aren't just wooden carrying cases - the wood is from a very early fire truck from the city that many of the Groomsmen grew up in.

2. Maybe you don't like to party or drink or go out much but if someone came to a party at my house and carried their beer in one of these we would be friends instantly. 

3. They won't go into storage, they will become storage. I'm sure they would also make a great magazine holder, centerpiece, tool holder etc. Your lack of imagination in that department is frightening.

Thank you for playing though. I actually laughed out loud in my cubicle. </TEXT>
