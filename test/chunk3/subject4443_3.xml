	<TEXT> It's the fight between the Radical Christian Terrorists and Radical Islamic Terrorists that's causing these problems. 

There are good people on both sides and blaming each other's religion rather than solve the differences will only end up creating more of the bad guys. 

As a non Christian, non Muslim all I want is for everyone to live peacefully. When we're not fighting each other, we'll be able to focus our resources on fighting things that really matter fatal diseases, poverty, illiteracy and many more. Which in a way are a contributing factor to the religious tensions.

Just my take on things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem mate.  

The 3GB/4GB/8GB is the video ram(vram)  memory size of the graphics card. The vram is the dedicated high speed temporary memory storage that's on board the graphics card and is used by it to store the components of a video like textures, polygons, etc which are used to render/generate the video. 

The graphics card uses it to quickly load, store and process the video data it needs to render on screen. 

This memory is different than your system RAM or main storage. It comes with the graphics card and as a result varies across different models. For modern games on low and mid settings 3GB of vram is OK. However for high and ultra settings, textures are more detailed which needs more vram.  Also, vram requirement goes up as the resolution you want it to display (say your monitor display) goes up. So you'll need more vram to display higher resolution textures on a 1440p or 2k/4k screen at high settings.  

Most of the best games these days(AAA titles)  need at least 4GB of vram. So it's always better to have more vram. (if you can afford it) 

About dx11 and dx12. 

They are the programming interfaces made by Microsoft to handle multimedia tasks like video game programming.  

Dx11 is currently the widely used one, while dx12 is the next iteration. Most games are on dx11 and some are being ported to dx12, however many will be made in dx12 in the future. So by getting a dx12 graphics card, you can future proof your build. 

My explanations here aren't exactly the best. I've tried to simplify things, but haven't exactly been good at it. Sorry for that. Let me know if you have any further questions.  Also. A great source for learning more about it is the LinusTechTips channel on YouTube. They give simplified overviews of these things.

	<TEXT> I'd say for that price get a new one. Wait for Ryzen.  Check r/amd for (rumored)  prices. Also it seems Intel might drop prices big time,  while releasing its newer line of processors although they've just released a new version. 

But frankly, for that price you could probably buy a 6core/12 thread Ryzen which can be overclocked. 

Consider going for an RX 480 8GB instead of the 1060. It's at same or lower price.  Gives similar performance for dx11 games and beats the 1060 in dx12 games 

16GB /8GB DDR4, 256 GB SSD, 1TB HDD. 
Rest is good 

Main thing is, wait. Unless you urgently need to get a PC wait, for prices are bound to fall.

DDR3 ram and just 500 GB of storage for that price aren't really worth it. 

Keep checking r/buildapcsales to get components other than processor, motherboard and power supply,before the new processors release in a couple of weeks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saw a bunch of PCs from the link you shared. None of them look appealing from a basic gaming perspective, no matter the price.  


Like others have said, wait for a couple of weeks, AMD is going to release their Ryzen line of processors. Looking at all the data and rumors there are about them their price to performance ratio is pretty awesome. 

That said, either if you want to go for an Intel processor or get a decent used PC for an affordable price, I'd say wait. Prices are bound to fall, probably drastically, which might get you a better Intel processor or a better setup from used PC catalog.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. My point or rather motivation is that had the people who are advocating this refugee ban are the very people who insisted on going to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, which has ultimately lead to this crisis.  Its hypocritical of them to cause the pain and suffering for their gains political, monetary, etc while refusing to share the burden of the outcome. 

I absolutely agree with you that the refugees need to be given a home and a chance to progress in their lives rather than shutting off and adding to their misery. If they want to adopt something we support, we need to stand up for them rather than showing them the door. 

Yes, we need to have checks in place but they shouldn't deter the people who wish to move here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way I look at it we wouldn't be in this whole refugee mess had the US not medalled in the middle east, especially the whole war in Iraq and Afghanistan .  The Iraq was ended up being a chain reaction. With nearly all of the surrounding regions being affected. And consequently the US to drop more troops and money in the region.  And more and more refugees getting created. 

Had the US stayed out of Afghanistan and the Middle East from the start and concentrated more efforts and money for projects at home, not only would it be far ahead of everyone in the world but would've been, in many ways self reliant and gained more respect. 

I feel that this whole war thing has ended up being more like a crusade. What most have started as a us vs them mindset was capitalised by the wrong people and used for their gains affecting everyone negatively. 

The present refugees would be in their countries and us in ours. No refugees to bother about, at least not in this scale.

Just my take on things. Let me know your thoughts on this matter </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm assuming this is being treated as a homicide case. For most of the people against Muslims are the very people who call themselves pro-life and insist that the foetus needs to be treated as any human and killing it is akin to murder. So in this case, I hope this guy gets thrown in for life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looking at your current build and your requirements I'd say wait for Zen. 

Check out AMD RyZen and Vega. They'll launch in March.  AMD had a demo showing off their capabilities at rendering in blender, if thats relevant.  

That said, if you can't wait or prefer Intel, for the graphics card I'd suggest you to go with the RX 480 8GB, preferably XFX GTR 480 or MSI twin frozr.  They're vr ready and not that expensive and will suit your purpose.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wish there was a mod where we could add a large library(like the one in Game Of Throned) to a city. And it would have all the books in the game plus more ones which are full blown novels, research maps and stuff. 

There would be a skill related to book reading and you could pour hours into it to gain the skill and knowledge. The new knowledge could also possibly help us in the outside world and other skills. And even give us more quests. 

Stuff to do after we've finished the entire game.  </TEXT>
