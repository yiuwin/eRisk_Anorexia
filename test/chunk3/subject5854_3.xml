	<TITLE> For those who have tried what do you guys think of Candy Land "Roo Dip" ? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-14 23:40:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I bought it a few times, the guy told me it was the flavor of Oreo creme at the shop, and I didn't realize it until reading something but it was right in front of my eyes, the flavor is based solely on the dip from "Dunkaroo" snacks, which was a big deal to have packed in your lunch when I was a kid in the 90s

* [Picture of Dunkaroos](http://www.hungryrunnergirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/3458265658_0c738c8be5_z.jpg)

* [Roo Dip](http://cdn3.volusion.com/pnhwe.bmygz/v/vspfiles/photos/CDY-ROO-2.jpg)

The first time I tried this flavor I don't think it was steeped enough (or much at all) and it had this very subtle tangy/slightly bitter finish on it that I thought ruined it. I sort of wrote it off for a few days, tried it again and that little 'note' went away.

This flavor is for the EXTREME sweet tooth vapers imo... I can vape a very sweet juice all day long, but this one is no joke. I just bought a Cleito and used to use a Uwell Crown tank, so I'm getting better flavor out of all my juices lately and it's hard to tell exactly.. but this one, WOW, it's so sweet that it will leave a flavor in your mouth as if you actually just ate something or drank something sweet like a vanilla shake.

I think they nail the flavor pretty well, I haven't had Roo Dip in years, but this flavor, to me it doesn't taste cheap or half assed, it's like they really did try to match the exact flavor of that dip or of the creme in between two cookies (Oreos or whatever kind really) it definitely has that taste. For this juice, it's very sweet but it's not just sugary. It's sweet in the way that the flavor was meant to be, which is a real treat getting such a strong flavor that doesn't taste like it's just bland and sugary. I really like it a lot, because of how intense the flavor is I think it'd be something that I purchase from time to time when I am in the mood for it.

I wouldn't recommend this flavor for everyone but for those that love sweet, candy, nostalgia, vanilla, or dessert flavors, I'd say give it a shot if you see it in a shop or feel like rolling the dice with something new.

	<TITLE> Old-timey O A YouTube Channels </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-05 19:04:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With all the monsters in uploading these days, some of the very old channels get lost in the mix.  This thread is to appreciate some older O A channels, back in the 15 minute upload limit days. A lot of these channels have tons of good gems that have been forgotten as the years have gone by. If you know of any feel free to add them to the list too:

* [Yarsh29](https://www.youtube.com/user/Yarsh29/videos?shelf_id=1 view=0 sort=dd) -- Tons of clips and moments and audio. Endless amount of clips to listen to. Uploads ends at 3 years ago and go all the way back to 7 years ago 

* [fobias79](https://www.youtube.com/user/fobias79/videos) -- Similar to Yarsh29, the uploads are from 6-7 years ago

* [Mrmys1900](https://www.youtube.com/user/Mrmys1900/videos?flow=grid sort=da view=0) -- Just like the above 2 channels, 

* [Frrrrrrrrunkis](https://www.youtube.com/user/Frrrrrrrrunkis/videos?flow=grid view=0 sort=da) -- Same description as Yarsh and probably with even MORE content, and still active. These 4 channels are the essential old time O A channels, between them it'd be impossible to run out of things to listen to

* [eyehatemyjob](https://www.youtube.com/user/eyehatemyjob/videos) -- Started uploading Chip videos that have multiple segments in each video around the time Norton started doing the character on the air regularly. THe uploads are from 3-6 years ago

* [hoohoohoorobin](https://www.youtube.com/user/hoohoohoorobin/videos) -- Medium amount of videos, 5-6 years ago with a lot of clips that are older from early XM days

* [TheBobWhooKidSamShow](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheBobWhookidSamShow/videos) -- The best source of any classic O A before XM days content one would need

* [Rick P](https://www.youtube.com/user/Hipcubbiesfan80/videos) -- Has a lot of assorted stuff involving Bill Burr on O A, O A clips, old Uninformed clips / other stuff

	<TITLE> Question for well-versed hardware/audio people about what I can do with my USB Audio interface the Steinberg UR12 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-04 10:43:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello guys, I was wondering if anyone out there could help me with a question. I purchased a Steinberg UR12 awhile back because I needed something simple but still pretty nice to do the job of getting my friend's guitar to play through my Logic Pro X so we could make music together.

Well I noticed that this thing has a lot of other options and output connections and stuff that I never use for the guitar. I am curious if I can use it to process/output my audio to my speakers also, taking advantage of the 24bit/192KHz capability it says it has. I don't know enough about this stuff but I dot know that this device acts a lot like my 7.1 surround usb soundcard that is only compatible with PC unfortunately.

If the device is capable of outputting audio to my speakers as well as recording which some of the connections / [this page](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/audio_interfaces/ur_serie/modelle/ur12.html) (which is the devices official product page from Steinberg) seem to vaguely hint at, I would love to switch over to that as my audio output to listen to some of my albums that are FLAC. Plus I might as well take full advantage of the purchase if I'm not doing so already. If anyone knows about these types of USB audio interfaces and can spot whether or not this does what I'm talking about, I can most likely figure out the rest on how to get it to my speakers. Thanks for reading

TL;DR -- Can the Steinberg UR12 output 24bit/192KHz audio through the Line Output connection in the back to a set of speakers? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What was the real reason Anthony came back to reddit this weekend? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-27 16:06:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We could say it was 4AM and alcohol, but that's no different than every single other night of Anthony Cumia's life. Something else more than that got him to come back to reddit this weekend.

If you read his Twitter on Thursdaym the reactions he was writing back to comments/criticism he was getting he realized something (finally), that the new wave of dolts he's attracting are the college campus liberal version of conservatives, and as soon as the circlejerk is broken they're all telling Anthony that they shut the show off and all this other dramatic bullshit.

I think he finally realized that the people here, for better or worse, know him better than any other fanbase, and hes just about accepted that unfortunate fact of life. He hates the fact that we talk about him like he's fallen from grace so much. He knows he's lost us so the best way to get our attention is to throw himself right back into the shit. Make himself so hated that 1. We start paying attention and talking about him all the time again and 2. We start watching his show again.  He wants to be so hated that he can be loved again. If he can't have that... at least he figures he'll have our attention. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Your favorite concert opener songs. For example, [The Cure's Plainsong opener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRGQFijFF0) is pretty great, the audio isn't great unfortunately but seeing the crowd jump right into gear when the lights/music explode is awesome. Plus, Plainsong is like the quintessential 80s new wave overture and gives me the warm and fuzzy feelings.

So I know there are a huge range of musical taste out there and I would love to hear from the reddit crowd about what is your favorite concert opener? What were some openers that blew you away when you saw the band live, or just awesome ones you've seen on YouTube? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Beginner Question: Converting FLAC files to a CD </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-14 00:07:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I searched for this but several of the results had some personalized twist to the question. 

I have an old stereo in my basement that can produce an awesome sound. I was using it with my iPod the other day and then switched over to a CD by accident that was randomly left in the disc drive. The difference in sound quality was instant, I forgot how even if it's subtle, it's still definitely noticeable how much fuller the bass sounded, the drums popped and snapped more crisply, the guitar you could hear with such a nice clarity that I could hear that sound of the pick hitting the strings again. I know that a lot of HQ MP3s sound nice but this got me on a tear.

I only have a few CDs left over from the old days and many are scratched to all hell and the skipping ruins the experience. I want to get back into listening to CDs but my only option is to burn my FLAC files to CDs. 

**TLDR;** Will I (in general) be able to obtain the exact same audio experience by using PowerISO or Toast etc. to burn FLAC files to a CD and pop it in my stereo as I had playing my old authentic CDs? If not, how much degradation are we talking about, and is it enough to say that I might as well just burn MP3s to a CD cause that would be the same thing?

Thanks all  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I am looking all over for these. STONAV has [hosted](http://www.spreadtheonavirus.com/classicona/XM%20Material/Worst%20Of%20The%20Week/) all of 2008 and some of 2007 for a long time, which are now permanently (hopefully) archived here: https://archive.org/download/oabestof2008

I am looking everywhere for all of the other years but so far I can only come up with 1 month's worth of 2011 left over on Rosiebuns old FTP on struff.com

Anyone out there have anything on an old hard drive laying around? They're pretty much gone everywhere from the next that  I can see so you may be the only hope at archiving them! The problem is that back in the old days these weren't very popular because it was worth it to just listen to the whole show for most people. Nowadays though as a nostalgia / easy way to sort out the show and hear the highlights, if we had these collected for every year that Rosiebuns did them it would be quite the amazing compendium of O A highlights over the years. </TEXT>

This is my streaming channel (normally use it for O A stuff) but tonight and some other nights I am streaming a shuffled playlist of 100+gigs of Howard TV stuff.

 I don't have everything out there yet, but I can take requests too if anyone has one and see if I have it. 

So if anyone is bored tonight and wants to watch some HTV feel free to come by and hang out!

~~EDIT (6:40AM EST) --~~

 Thank you guys for watching! I had a lot of fun talking to people and watching etc! I have some people who count on the channel starting at 7AM for the regular day schedule stuff but tonight at 6PM or a bit after will start the Artie Roast Mayhem + 4HR extended version of the Artie roast so everyone is very welcomed to stop back tonight ! After that late-night it will be random HTV episodes or requests

EDIT (10:00PM EST) --

We're back live all night! </TEXT>

##Original Article

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.showbiz.gossip/BoU9KeNZgac

Star Magazine 'Confidential'
Guess Who?

This high-profile celeb popped up in a Gotham hospital at 2am and cried his
eyes out while doctors treated his 16 year old daughter for an overdose of
ecstasy. She recently was brought to St Vincent's Hospital in a
near-comatose-state after a rave.  The teen snapped out of it and was released
to her compulsively private daddy, who left with her through the back door so
he wouldn't be recognized by fans.


##Wackbaggers talking about it 10 yrs ago

https://www.wackbag.com/threads/how-the-emily-story-broke.37896/#post-777202

Anthony's recounting of the facts left a few details out. 

The story surfaced on alt.fan.howard-stern when someone Googled Emily's name and found the theater's site. They asked if this Emily was Hoohoo's daughter. When it was confirmed, several memebrs of the group posted the information to various venues including this one. 
I am assuming that is what brought it to the attention of the b-b-boys and, from there, the media.
Not everyone gets to go to the high profile Pest functions but there are those who fight the battle every day and they should get credit

Please spare me the normal nasty Wackbag responses, thanks

[Emily Stern](http://tinypic.com/jtl213.jpg)

This was around the time the show went after Emily Stern:

[1/9/06](http://www.struff.com/vbulletin/showthread.php/1857-January-09-2006-Monday-Bill-Burr-call-Keith-the-Cop)

[1/17/06](http://www.struff.com/vbulletin/showthread.php/1863-January-17-2006-Tuesday-Patrice-Oneal-Bill-Burr)

But maybe it was before all of these dates, since that guy on the forum is talking about the segment and that post was on 1/6/06. I can't tell if the guy on Wackbag is talking specifically about the Emily Stern Kabbalah play story, of if it's about the OD story.

Can we recover this lost bit of audio? I've been reading other fan forums and sites from a long time ago and a lot of people claim it's wiped from everywhere. If we could even get a date it happened we would probably be in business, I have every show as do a lot of people so if we can even narrow it down to a date it happened then we should have our answer if it was truly wiped or not! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Because of my setup I work in a separate area from where I have my player streaming from, and a bluetooth speaker outputting the audio. However I get this "Are you still listening?" thing every couple hours and it's kind of a pain.

 It's not a huge deal at all but if there is some kind of workaround out there, or a tip, I would love to know about it if anyone has anything

P.S. One other side question. Is there any 3rd party software that has Sirius XM integration? Sort of like an iTunes / foobar2k /  Winamp / MediaMonkey type of program that you can play SXM online stuff through. Just checking to see if one is out there

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance if you have any tips or tricks for either of these questions </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **2004** 

In August, 2004, at the time the Infinity contract expired, the pair signed with XM Satellite Radio and started broadcasting their show again on October 4th of the same year. Jim Norton, Steve C, and Ben Sparks continued working with O A at XM, and it was there that E-Rock was first brought on as a producer. Also, several interns (Than, Danny, Travis, Derek, and later Sam) impressed O A so much that they became full-time members of the show staff.

At first, the duo were only available on a premium channel because of XM's initial concern at hiring the controversial pair, but listener ship was high enough that in April, 2005 the show was allowed to be a part of the regular subscription service. On XM Satellite Radio, O A were no longer bound by FCC regulations regarding language and content; thus, O A were able to get away with a lot more than they could on terrestrial radio.

**2005**

Although O A matured a bit since their 'NEW days, they still managed to generate controversy. One show, commonly referred to as the "show we can't talk about", nearly got them fired mere weeks after starting on XM. Their Assault on the Media competition, where O A fans (nicknamed the Pests) were asked to disrupt live news broadcasts, led to a news reporter getting injured. An altercation Opie had with an intern named Noah also got them in trouble. Still, the show began to rebuild its audience, and eventually their former company, Infinity (now known as CBS Radio), was looking to bring them back.

**2006**

In 2006, Howard Stern abandoned terrestrial radio in order to broadcast his show on XM competitor Sirius. This left a void that needed to be filled at the stations Howard used to broadcast from. Some of these stations replaced Howard with David Lee Roth, a move that proved to be a disaster ratings-wise. CBS Radio had to do something, so they brought back O A to try to save their company. As of April 26, 2006, O A were officially back on terrestrial radio. In a deal with both CBS and XM, the show was now airing nationwide on both formats from 6-9 AM ET, and then exclusively on XM from 9 AM-12 PM ET. O A have said that this is the deal Howard should have made.

**2007**

In 2007, XM and Sirius announced that they were planning a merger of both companies. At the time, there was much speculation on what would happen to The Opie and Anthony Show. Their former boss Mel Karmazin became the CEO of Sirius and was expected to take over the reins of the combined company. Since Howard was still broadcasting his show on the platform, and his friendship with Mel was still intact, it was believed that O A would not have a place at the merged company, or would be silenced like they were during the WNEW days. In May of that year, the duo ended up getting suspended from XM for 30 days because of comments made by a guest named Homeless Charlie. It was believed that fears over those comments affecting the merger led to this action, as O A have done (and said) much worse without incident. Following the suspension, Pests began dropping their XM subscriptions in droves and smashing their radios. When O A returned to XM in June, they credited the Pests with helping them keep their jobs.

Despite the victory, O A and the Pests were not confident of the show's future.

**2008**:

The merger eventually became finalized in 2008 (with the combined company now known as Sirius XM), and O A's biggest supporter at XM, Eric Logan, left the company. O A's XM contract was set to expire at the end of September of that year, but fortunately it was renewed, and as of September 30, their show became available on Sirius, on channel Sirius 197. As of April, 2009, O A began broadcasting from Sirius' studios in New York. Though still treated like redheaded stepchildren (what else is new?), their future at Sirius XM remained secure. Their situation on terrestrial radio, however, was not so fortunate. Because of constant fears over controversial content, the terrestrial portion of their show was often hampered by ridiculous censorship by their bosses. O A also dealt with being dropped by key terrestrial affiliates.

**2009**

March 2009, their flagship station K-Rock went through a format change, dropping O A in the process and thereby taking them off any remaining affiliates. While O A no longer have to worry about censorship to an extent, it is a blow to not have the exposure that free terrestrial radio provides as opposed to a pay service like Sirius XM.

Recently, the fate of O A was up in the air. Contract negotiations with Sirius XM hit a setback - with O A's contract expiring at the beginning of October, 2010 O A still hadn't come close to a deal as time was running out. Eventually they both managed to sign a two-year contract, even though they have said they are not happy with it (Opie actually didn't sign until the morning of October 1). Also, O A lost longtime producer Steve C, whose position was eliminated by the company.

	<TEXT> You can always use Struff.com, it's the most detailed by far, but if you just want to see what guests are on a certain episode or get a brief idea for what's in it, here are some alternatives:

* From 2004-2008: 
http://pastebin.com/bKhHcdNf


This isn't perfect especially with the spelling but it's very quick to get around, using the ctrl+F you can find any comedian and most of their appearances etc:



* From July 2007 - Present: [This search setting from Audible](http://www.audible.com/search/ref=sr_sort_publication_date?searchAuthor=Opie+%26+Anthony searchRank=publication_date searchSize=50 searchRankSelect=-publication_date searchsize=50)


(( If the link doesn't work for you: just search Opie and Anthony, when you see one show up with the red and white logo click on the author name "Opie   Anthony" then at the top corner of the search go to Sort by: Release date, then all the way back to page 113 to start at June/July 2007. ))

You can see the titles and see the guests for every episode (they're inconsistent with this in the early years) but click any episode and you will get a very brief rundown of what they discuss in the episode. You don't need a subscription or account or anything to browse this and read episode descriptions. You can also easily search this list by clicking Advanced Search at the top and typing "Opie   Anthony" for Author, and then any keywords you want to search [for example Patricki episodes](http://www.audible.com/search?advsearchKeywords=patrice searchTitle= searchAuthor=Opie+%26+Anthony searchNarrator= searchProvider= field_subjectbin= field_content_type-bin= field_format-bin= field_publication_date= field_runtime= field_language=9178177011 x=37 y=12) Struff is the most comprehensive and detailed but this is very easy to navigate and clean / concise </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Watched the LOS reddit AMA on YouTube... they are going to be done with The Anthony Cumia Network in June </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-17 09:32:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The LOS contract is up in June, a 1 year contract.

During this AMA -- a week or 2 before the arrest -- first they were talking about if they were going to continue doing 2 shows a week. Luis phrases his answer like "After the Cumia thing is up, and we aren't under contract to do 2 shows a week anymore"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V-cpo6QB5s t=1h19m15s


LOS also says (I think at 1:25:00 or near it) that the money that TACS pays them isn't enough to make a big difference where they can stop doing things in their lives, but it can pay their rent. So it's something to consider that maybe they stay because of that... however they might want to free themselves up for getting other opportunities too and they clearly said recently they are trying to distance themselves from the name... it doesn't seem that the name of the network is changing though as far as we know.

Now.. at one other point in this, LOS mentioned that they did end up getting better access to guests through TACS. However you could argue that 1. That has come to an abrupt end (possibly, or at least for awhile) and 2. The connections have already been made with people like Vos, Bonnie, Norton, Bob Kelly, etc. where even if they left TACN there is lots of potential to get any of those people back on their show

So all in all, LOS was probably on the fence before everthing happened with Dani. But now it's just pretty much a waiting game until June and they are long gone Peckasucka was making some good posts about it so looking into it deeper in that regard it's definitely looking grim for a future with LOS in the picture for TACN </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So there was a bit of a breakdown today at the end of the show, some tension on the channel. Sam was stirring the shit during it but it seems like Stangels and E-Rock don't see eye to eye. Stangel is upset at the way that E-rock plays replays. E-rock seems to be tired of the Stangels. Sam was messing with everyone. Stangel even tried to call out Opie and keep him honest when Opie said he didn't listen, Stangel said no you do listen, you text me about certain things and why they're on. Trouble in paradise...

	<TEXT> Best episode he has had since the arrest. He's being completely honest, said he was depressed, said what do you want from me, he sleeps and watches documentaries all day, people tell him to see a doctor but the only doctor he's seeing is Dr. Steve for drinks. Then he started pouring his anger randomly into chewing out Rat with a bitter disdain because he overheard Rat giving some opinions to the other staff regarding the Grammy's in the back room. He has just about had it, but he's making it as entertaining as possible. It's not an episode for the ages, but it's a spark of life in the show imo... it starts near the beginning with the calls </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Idea for a weekend show at TACS: Saturday Night Open Mic </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-14 07:24:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This could be an open mic night where a random show or comedian or podcast host comes in,  they can apply on anthonycumia.com and if they at least have a significant thing going or are a notable name, then Erin can sign them up. They get to do 1 hour on Saturday night... then maybe we can post about it in /r/tacsdiscussion or start a conversation up on Twitter about how it was. It would be a cool thing for saturday nights, and treat it like a tryout and have people do it for free.

Plus then you get to cross market your show on every single person who wants to come in and do a show, they'll Twitter it to their fans that they are going to be on anthonycumia.com ... you get to put your name in a lot of new peoples ears, we get new content that changes every week and also get a weekend show. Plus this way if some magic happens with one of the random people and the fans love them, there's some potential for a new addition to the network.  </TEXT>

I would love to see a full show with video in that nice studio with no Opie shackling everything down or trying to make everything all happy and positive. Norton hasn't done YKWD in what seems like years. Bobby has a nice setup going, he loves to play Ring Leader with all these open micers, one episode where all of his old friends come in and smash him while he tries to corral everyone would be great </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-01-08 07:08:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> LOS was not mentioned by Anthony today as he was slowly speaking about the network and how he appreciates people like Gavin and Pat, that they appreciate having this place to come and talk and say what they want. 

LOS was making a lot of jokes and straight up said they are trying to distance themselves from Anthony, and want the site name changed. Supposedly they were also on periscope making even more jokes like "All the hits" etc. or thats what I read here on reddit.

Today Zac Amico also said that it could be the last time he's even on the show so he has to get it all out now. That might have been unrelated or maybe it goes along with some tension behind the scenes with Skanks coming straight out and saying all that about Anthony. 

One thing that comes to mind is that Anthony has been blocking people on Twitter for saying similar things that Zac had made a joke about. For them to be making jokes and also saying that the site should be changed, I can't imagine Anthony loves that. Perhaps the network will have one less show next contract negotiations? </TEXT>
