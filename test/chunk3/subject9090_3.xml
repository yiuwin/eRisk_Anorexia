	<TEXT> Gotta have to listen to that .I initially anticipated  that Alex's father ,Wyler Senior,knew some secret about crossing times which he would tell Alex in the end.This movie strangely reminded me of the sci fi series Fringe and its alternative universe concept though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never thought that the Venom will be accorded the status of a standalone mega villain,Sandman was more suitable for that .Wouldn't the storyline of Venom overlap with the Spiderman sequels ? will Spiderman be given a secondary role in the venom ? A character such as Venom enmeshed in an established storyline like that of Spiderman cannot replicate the success of Deadpool </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Richard Gere is one of the finest actor of our times ,and I'm not discounting the China factor in his shunning by Hollywood,yet  I think he deserved better than his recent films.By saying that ,I mean he shouldn't have signed on these mundane films like Benefactor or the Arbitrage ,to be honest ,they were not commensurate with his talents .I think Gere should also venture into small screen ,and should not limit himself to narrow confines of movies . </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Ending of Lake House Movie ( Time travel stuff ) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Though generally I'm not a big fan of romantic movies,yet Lakehouse has caught my attention due to its unique storyline ( all that time travel stuff )While I've come to like this movie ,the time travel concept shown in this film is a bit fuzzy ,if Alex Wyler waits for Kate for 2 years ,and comes to meet her in 2008 while she's at the postbox near Lakehouse,the original Kate should be in 2010 (what happened to me her ) infact he's going to meet her past self .Similarly ,as Alex accidental death was prevented by Kate ,wouldn't it have some effect as a whole on the storyline ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Boss

A man goes into a pet shop to buy a parrot. The shop owner points to three identical looking parrots on a perch and says: "The parrot on the left costs 500 dollars".
"Why, does the parrot cost so much?" asks the man. The owner says, "Well the parrot knows how to use a computer".

The man then asks about the next parrot and is told that this one costs 1,000 dollars because it can do everything the first parrot can do plus it knows how to use the UNIX operating system.

Naturally, the increasingly startled man asks about the third parrot and is told that it costs 2,000 dollars. Needless to say this begs the question, "What can it do?"

To which the owner replies, "To be honest I have never seen it do a thing but the other two call him boss!"

	<TEXT> Van Gogh suffered from bipolar disorder with alternate cycle of mania and depression,however,I don't think that quote could be attributed to someone in maniac stages.It shows,rather than euphoric state,a deep penchant for painting and a resoluteness that is inherent in every creative genius,thus giving them impetus to paint despite non appreciation of their art by populace </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dylan that's the most selfless thing a person could do,giving such a precious organ without any expectation in return and you should be enormously proud of that.How long was the recovery process and how it felt like(I'm medical doctor but haven't met many kidney donors,those I met have donated it to a family member?)? Did you meet the person to whom you have given such an enormous gift?  </TEXT>
