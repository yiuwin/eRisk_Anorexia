	<TEXT> I have one, works great.  Sometimes i wake up just from the light, very gentle way to wake up form deep sleep.

I use the built in radio alarm clock, if i dont wake up from the light it will start playing some music with increasing volume. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your very detailed answer. Your informations are really interesting.



I just want to contradict one point:
 If a PC is actually obsolete, they can sell it.

From my experience, most mid sized companies do not make the effort to sell obsolete PC hardware. Most of the time its simply cheaper for them to throw it away because you need an employee to organize the sale.

Btw i did not say they will throw them away after 2 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do we have an estimate how much they spend for rent, power, servers, hardware etc... (everything not employee cost) ?

I think they have to spend a lot of money for hardware.
If the Star Citizen Demo PC Build is their "standard issue" PC: http://www.gamersnexus.net/news/2637-system-specs-for-demo-pcs-at-citizencon-2016

The PC, 2 monitors and input devices will cost about 2500-3000$... some people will get a cheaper one, some a even more expensive version...

Thats just about 1.000.000 $ for PC hardware (That will last maybe 2-4 years)

And thats just the PC for every employee, they also need network:
Switches
NAS
Servers
etc...

-------------------------

I have no idea how much it costs to rent office space, online severs. 
no estimate here... </TEXT>
