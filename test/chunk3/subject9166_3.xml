	<TITLE> [TOMT][Song] Electro-House/EDM track with the linked melody </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-30 13:47:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started working on a track yesterday and came up with this melody, 
https://clyp.it/yrge0xz1

BUT I'm 80% sure this is not creativity but memory. 
So which song is this?? I'm looking for a track that just matches with the start of this melody, mainly. 
Hoping that this doesn't really exist so I can use it.
If it does, well one more song to listen to so it's all good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you partially, as in yes it's not gonna happen if you have zero technical skills, but I think that you don't need "amazing" technical skills to reach the sufficient quality that electronic music nowadays requires, you need experience to learn/understand the absolute basics of what you're doing.

Looking back at my tracks, it took a short time for me to vastly improve my work quality when I started realising where I'd been fucking up all along, rather than putting more work into it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here, watch this, Jay Hardway breaking down his track Electric Elephants. In the video he talks about how he works more like a composer and less as a producer.

youtube.com/watch?v=6dxanyRBeRQ client=mv-google gl=US hl=en

On communities including this one he received flak for a previous tutorial he did where he said he didn't really know what a compressor does. Communities like this one here focus a lot on the technical aspects of production, and it's natural BUT you shouldn't feel like you can't make good electronic music unless you're Nicky Romero incarnate. I suggest watching the vid I linked above and seeing how he works, because his way of production is focused mainly on the musical element itself, using the tools in the DAW without getting too deep and stressing about the technicalities. Imho you CAN make good sounds and good music relying on your 'musicality' more than your technicality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The master plan involved Malfoy disarming Dumbledore to become the actual owner of the wand, and Voldemort THINKING it was Snape because Snape was the one who killed Voldemort.

	<TEXT> No , Ableton is not the standard. It has come to the point right now where choosing DAWs is just a matter of workflow, aesthetics and opinion. Just google Ableton vs FL Studio and you'll quickly come to know.
Additionally, the most widely used DAW in electronic and hip hop production is easily FL Studio. FL Studio has a much gentler learning curve over Ableton too. Plus a much lower price tag. 

Edit: quick googling tells me that FL is actually not the MOST prevalent. I was speaking from personal observation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess this is a fairly recent song, I'm guessing this year or the last, at the latest. Here's what I could recreate to the best of my ability :c
 https://clyp.it/pq3mvkm5

It's fairly famous so I'm expecting success here. Been stuck in my head too long.

EDIT: A bit more description: the song in question was fairly slow paced and sort of melancholic, I remember just a bit of the video and I think it was a couple in a house messing around or something. The chorus consists of the singer going 'whoaaa-ohhhhh-oh-oh' consistent with the 4 separated notes you can hear in the clip at 7 seconds. The singer's voice is similar to AlunaGeorge, but it's not her, I've checked.

Solved edit: /u/coranns nailed it! It was [New Scene by Felix Cartal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGCq9n18H4U). I can now live in peace. Thanks to everyone who replied! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> haha, you don't truly realise how much of a pussy you are until you look out the window on the left side and there's nothing but a void below ending hundreds of feet below in a raging green river. Every fucking tilt of the car feels like you're gonna die. I have dreams like these sometimes, used to have them more frequently earlier, and they almost always ended with me rolling off the slope and dying. </TEXT>
