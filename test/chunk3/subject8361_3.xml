	<TEXT> I have wavy hair that I have no clue how to work with. It gets really really frizzy and dry. I wash my hair with pantene shampoo and conditioner about every other day, using a brush to get the knots out while conditioning. Then I let it air dry or put it in a bun or braid. Yesterday I bought some mousse for curl definition from Pantene. Is that ok? If I need it to look nice, the flat iron comes out. Sometimes it gets super curly but I don't see any pattern as to why. Basically, I am helpless case! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom worked in a bridal salon when she was in college.

Sizing was a nightmare. Sandra came in to try on gowns. She tried on the large sample dress, had it pinned to see how it would look on her if it was her size. She said this was it, so my mom took her measurements, and figured out what size she needed to order.

My mom told her her dress will be a size 8 based on her measurements; Sandra threw a fit. "That's impossible! All of my other dresses are size 4! I have been a size 4 since I was 14. I am not an 8! Order me a 4!" 

My mom would explain how sizes vary from designer to designer and that, while she may be a 4 normally, with the designer of her dress her measurements are considered an 8, and it's just a number, and if it's too big it can be taken-in but a 4 couldn't be taken-out... Sandra took none of that. Despite all protest, she demanded a 4.

A couple weeks before the wedding her size 4 dress arrived. It wouldn't zip (duh). Bride had a meltdown. Mom had to apologize and reorder a larger dress at the bridal salon's expense.  </TEXT>
