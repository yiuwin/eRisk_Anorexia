	<TEXT> I don't know anything about edibles (I'm relatively new myself. Well, new to doing it on my own instead of just bumming off of friends.) Grasscity.com is where I bought my bubbler. Wasn't super expensive, came relatively quickly, and super discreet. Check out their website. They have some good stuff. Good luck!!

	<TEXT> I totally feel this! I was an idiot and got addicted to opiates a few years ago. I've been trying really hard to get clean the past couple months. I have a buddy who smokes me out any time he knows I'm having a hard time and about to relapse, even if I have my own bud. He says he wants to help and it's the best way he knows how. I kind of literally owe him my life at this point. That's what it's all about. Sharing the love, helping out your fellow human being.

Peace and Love homies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was the reason that my friend first told me that I should give it a try. But aside from just that, for me at least, it took my anxiety down so much and that helped me get y eating habits back on track. Like it helped me to just not stress so much about my weight and shit like that. Just kind of helped chill me out when I need it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could not agree more. There's absolutely nothing worse than someone who can't just let you be when you've reached your limit. I had a friend that I would smoke with when I very first started smoking. He'd been smoking 10 years compared to my 1 month. I had zero tolerance. I still don't have a super high one. And honestly, I am perfectly fine with that. But he just wouldn't let it be. Every time he took a hit, I had to take a hit. I would get waaaay too high every single time. I couldn't handle myself. It wasn't even enjoyable. It almost ruined weed for me. Luckily, after a sit down talk about it he finally backed off and just let me go at my own pace. 
Be respectful, share the love friends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A little bit of both. Definitely starts out a mental thing and that part of it never goes away. But after you've been starving yourself for long enough there are obviously physical affects on your body. In my experience (and from talking to other people with similar issues it's pretty universal) you stop getting hunger pains eventually. Like your stomach literally stops sending the signals to your brain that say you're hungry. And then it's awful when you do try and eat because your stomach has shrunk significantly due to starvation. Eating makes you sick and is extremely painful. Mentally it's really tough to force yourself to eat. There's a lot of anxiety and fear associated with it. Part of the clinical definition of anorexia is an EXTREME fear of weight gain. That's the biggest part of the mental side. For me it was at least. Your entire worth as a human being is rooted in that number, so eating is a really scary thing. Feels like failure. I don't know. It's hard to explain. ha

	<TEXT> I did when I was younger, after I was first hospitalized. I spent a little bit of time in a treatment center, but I certainly didn't take it seriously and did everything I could to get out of there without actually making any changes or getting any better. I did alright on my own for a little while. When I moved out of my parents' house it got much worse though. This is the first time I've ever felt like I have control of it and like it doesn't need to rule my entire life. :)

Thanks all!

	<TEXT> Oh you weren't rude at all. I agree completely. It's a little messed up for her to be asking me to sell them for her. And like, she knows I'm really tight on money right now so I could use it. It's just a messed up situation all around. I think I'll be able to keep saying no to her.. Scares me a bit though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately, the fact that she knows I have a history with drug use is why she came to me. She knew I would know people who would buy. And I won't lie. For a minute after she asked me, I seriously considered buying them myself. She and my sister are the two people I hang out with the most now that I've lost all my social life because all my friends use. I've been to a few NA meetings. They aren't bad. I've met a couple of friends there. But I feel a little out of place because I'm the only person at my local groups that isn't there because of court stuff. I feel so self conscious when I go, like they are all judging me as someone who isn't as far gone as they are. But I'm trying really hard to make connections with people there. Thanks for the advice and support. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Losing support </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-08 04:41:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's been a little while since I've posted here. I thought I was doing well and had everything under control. And I guess I'm not doing badly. Things are just getting harder and I'm getting really frustrated.

I have 35 days clean. 35 long, hard days. I was feeling so great when I finally hit 30 days though. I really thought I was going to be able to make it through this and stay clean for good this time. But lately I feel like I'm losing all the support I had, which wasn't much to start off with. 

My sister has been reasonably good at supporting me through this. But when I told her I'd reached my 30 day mark, she got angry and yelled at me, saying that she didn't give a shit and if I was actually trying to get clean I wouldn't bother counting my clean time. She told me she didn't want to hear any of my shit and that I could fuck off and stop dragging her down with me.

I have a friend who just had a surgery. She's been pretty good at supporting me. She asked me if I knew anyone who would want to buy the left over of her prescription and if I'd help her sell it. Which isn't a terrible thing to do, I guess. It just is so frustrating to me. I'm trying so hard to leave that life behind and move on. But it feels like everyone is against me. I lost almost all of my friends when I decided  to get clean. And now I feel like the few who stayed are turning against me as well. I just don't know what to do or how to approach this situation alone and deal with the lack of support. Any thoughts or advice?



TL;DR: I have 35 days clean but I feel like I'm losing what little support system I had.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was the exact opposite while I was detoxing.. All I wanted to do was cuddle up or hold hands or even just have someone in the same bed with me. I got needy as fuck. And simultaneously really bitchy. I wouldn't have put up with me. Luckily I had a friend who was really, really good about it though and would sit and watch the original Star Trek with me all night while I sat on the couch and was shaky and sick.

But that's probably just the girl in me coming out..  </TEXT>
