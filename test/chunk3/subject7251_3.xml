	<TEXT> It's just simply going to put a bad taste in players mouths imo. Theres too much potential for abuse of the system for it to be worth it. If its a new player and they are struggling, more seasoned players should help them. The only reason this system would be useful would be for a player that is trolling, or sabatoging a mission deliberately, but trolls would know this and just make the damage requirement and then keep trolling, and tbh I don't feel trolls are a problem in this game anyway as they are very few.  </TEXT>
