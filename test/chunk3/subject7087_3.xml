	<TEXT>  This is just the go to shaming tactic the Clinton Shills always resort to.

so saying a judge cant do his job because his "mexican" isn't xenophobia? its just a "shaming tactic" HAHAHA

so banning nearly 1/4th of the worlds population isn't bigotry? it's just a "shaming tactic? HAHAHA

so many more examples.. GOP insiders even call him racist

sure, I never said clinton was perfect but she sure is better than trump

and ahhh she said a rude word like 20 years ago? actions speak louder than words
