	<TEXT> For some reason, my post got removed. Maybe because I actually had a legitimate question and was looking for advice...Something that's uh, apparently not allowed on this subreddit?


Anyways, I'm thankful I got a lot of really great replies from a lot of you guys! I really appreciate it and I'll read through them all as soon as I get the chance. Some of you really took the time to answer thoughtfully and thoroughly and made me think about my entire situation a little differently.

But anyways, thank you for taking the time to respond to me, even the negative, harsh people, because they've illustrated exactly what I do not want to become and just ironically pushed me to really re evaluate whether or not I want to continue being a part of a group with people who claim to believe in one God, but who act so judgmental and critical of their fellow brothers and sisters.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh okay!

I suppose it wouldn't be ignorant or immature of me to turn my back on the man I care about, love and who makes me into a better person, simply because he has not taken on the title of "Muslim". 


I suppose the mature thing to do here is to leave this terrible non-Muslim man whom I've formed a profound connection with and attachment to, so that I can passively wait for some Muslim man to come along and ask my parents for my hand. 

A man who I'll probably know for less than a year and a lot less intimately and who I'll probably feel no personal connection with, but hey he says he's Muslim so that's a drastic improvement, right????


That's maturity!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh really? And what kind of response would you expect from a non-infatuated person? It seems anything I say on here just labels me as an infatuated little girl who has no maturity or knowledge of Islam.


I guess it's my fault.  I should really just learn to keep my mouth shut and accept everything a "knowledgeable" Muslim person tells me to do, without batting an eye. Like a good Muslim girl should! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excuse me, who are you to say we're "lost"? Who are you to judge me or him?? Stop taking it up on yourself to do God's job. 


Your comment is full of ignorance and close mindedness. You're basically just perpetuating the idea that "this is the way things should be done because this is the way things have always been done because God said so" and you're not answering WHY. 


Wait, the reason why women can't marry outside of their religion is because they'll give up their religion once they do?? Since when do you know what all the women in the world are going to do? Maybe if women were able to marry outside of their religion in the first place, then they wouldn't face the problem of giving up their faith in order to be with a person they love who happens to be of a different faith.


It's sad how the zealous, closed minded people are always the ones who try to represent all Muslims and try to push their interpretation of Islam onto everyone. You give the Muslims who are willing to discuss and question things a run for their money.


And I'm not joking about hell...If all you're doing is blindly following the rules  because you're afraid of hell and afraid you won't reap the benefits of having all those pleasures in heaven, if you're doing things because it is just "the way" it's been done, without questioning whether or not they are fundamentally right or wrong, then that's just sad.  </TEXT>

I'm the one who's encouraging people to follow things with a blind eye and the second they start questioning them, they're simply passed off as "immature" or just "infatuated". Oh please. Grow up. You don't know anything about me and I highly doubt you have or ever will know anything about love.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And not surprisingly, you're ignorant and have one way of thinking of things. Either I'm infatuated and following the devil or I have to follow the way things have been done with no questions asked, even if they don't make sense. 


Of all the subreddits, I thought this one would be more open to questions, considering Islam encourages curiosity and independent thought. Most of you are just looking down on this and passing it off as simply infatuation just because it doesn't fit in with what you've been brought up to believe. It's a damn shame.  </TEXT>

But I don't find fear to be a good enough reason to continue or discontinue doing something, where you are hurting no one. 


If I had a concrete reason of why I would be punished for loving someone, then maybe I'd be more accepting of the whole thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose I understand the whole conceptual reason behind fasting, but I just feel like a hypocrite when I fast and pray and then deep in my heart I'm questioning why I have to abide by a rule that makes no sense to me. 


I'm not trying to attack you personally or anything, but I think it's really sad that you're sort of insinuating that love doesn't really exist and that it just serves to confuse us. 


And its extremely sad that you're comparing marriage to a business transaction. Why can't there be love?? It will only serve to make the marriage stronger and the individuals more compassionate and caring for one another.  

Do you really believe a marriage is stronger or healthier if people get married because of the agreed size of a mahr? Or because they have grown fond of each other, love each other and genuinely care for each others' well being?

I personally believe that falling in love with an individual's character and forming an attachment will maintain a far more healthier marriage than viewing each other as an expendable object in one's life that was arranged through a marriage contract. 


There are many men in this day and age who are willing to respect their partner's religious freedoms. In fact, it is rare that there isn't.  My man has always been supportive and would never deny me my right to practice my religion or teach my children about my religion. 

Lastly, if my daughter said that to me, I would honestly be proud of her. Because that would mean she was certain of what she wanted from life and that she was truly in love, which I believe is far more important in life than having security.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe I'm not as knowledgeable about Islam as many of you, but I did seek to learn about it of my own accord.  


And on my journey this is the one thing that really didn't settle well in my mind. That a man is given the upper hand simply for holding the title of a Muslim, and that I cannot marry the man I love simply for that fact. 

I admire Islam for encouraging curiosity and questions, and that is why I'm asking this right now. Because to me, a lifetime with the love of my life is worth an eternity of every single hell fire I would have to endure in the after life. 


My biggest question is what kind of God would be so vindictive as to punish me for loving another soul that he Himself created? I don't want to believe this is the way the world simply works.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I'm passed that whole fervent, blind sighted, honey moon phase. 


I've been with him for more than a year, and I truly care for him with all my heart. I don't believe I'm blind. I see his flaws and he sees mine and we're accepting of them and each other. 


I love him to death and back. Ever since I've been with him, I've become more aware of the issues in my life, and he's done nothing but encourage me towards self improvement. I think this is what a partnership/marriage is all about; being with someone who pushes you to be the very best you can be. He's my other half, my soul mate. 


If these feelings were temporary, I think they would have started fading by now, but they only grow stronger by the day for both of us. 

We're so sure we want to be with each other, and we've kept our rationale with us. I don't believe that just because we love each other everything will automatically be okay and alright, and in fact we've both been very careful because we know these are dangerous grounds to be stepping on. 


I don't understand how being with the person you love and enjoy being with would ruin your life. It's as if being happy is something terrible, and that if I'm not with someone who simply has the title of "Muslim", I'm doing something terrible.  </TEXT>

Why would I just replace the man I love, who has the same exact value system, but isn't Muslim, with a Muslim man simply because that man is Muslim. 


I love THIS man, not the revert. Why does the Muslim man have the upper hand and get selected first if I have no feelings for him. Why should him being Muslim be enough for me to turn my back on the guy I actually care about?? Makes no sense to me... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole point of this post was to point out that anorexia manifests itself all around the world in different circumstances. It is a disease of the mind, and is seen EVERYWHERE, much like schizophrenia. It is not just exclusive to "first world" countries where "spoiled children are just refusing to eat" and the comparisons are COMPLETELY relevant to each other. 

Anorexia is classified when a person maintains a low body weight and there is refusal to gain sufficient weight. Usually, this is accompanied by some kind of traumatic experience that made the individual feel a loss of control in their lives and empowered or satisfied by a restrictive consumption of food.

In either case, the individual is not eating because s/he is not capable of giving up the control they feel from restricting their food intake. Those people in Africa who do not eat, despite having food around them are in fact ANOREXIC. They have experienced an extremely traumatic event where they felt an immense loss of control and now, it is reflective in their consumption habits. 


This is exactly the same as someone who is experiencing anorexia in, let's say the U.S. Something happens, causes the person to feel a loss of control in their lives, the person responds by restricting their food intake in order to feel as though they have control in their lives. 

In fact, most mental illnesses follow this pattern. There is a genetic predisposition to the mental disorder, a stressor causes the illness to be induced and the recovery from the illness is along and grueling process. This is especially true of adults with anorexia, where relapse rates are extremely high. 

The point is, anorexia is a mental illness, much like every other mental illness and just like we don't blame people for having schizophrenia, we shouldn't blame them for having anorexia.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eating disorders are a REAL mental illness. In anorexia nervosa  the person typically has a chaotic sense of control in their life and seek to satisfy their feeling of control via food restriction. Eating disorders generally have very little to do with people not "counting their blessings" that they have food to eat and more to do with emotional and mental problems from current or past traumatic experiences.

Like almost every other mental illness, people with anorexia nervosa DO have delusions. Their brain actually tricks them into perceiving themselves as fatter than they are when they look in the mirror. Their brain's dangerous sense of perfectionism is extremely self destructive as they try to persistently lose more and more weight. 

People with anorexia also have low amounts of serotonin (an important hormone in mood regulation) and have high co-morbid rates with depression. Anorexia nervosa has the highest death rate amongst all of the eating disorders, with patients usually killing themselves or dying from complications from a very low body weight. This mental illness is no joke, and saying you should just "be glad you have good food to eat" oversimplifies the entire disorder. 


Also, it's not a first world problem. In parts of Africa, where starvation is rampant, it is seen in children and families when food is reintroduced into the household, the family members still refuse to eat or gain a healthy amount of weight. 

After WW2, victims of concentration camps also had the same problem with gaining sufficient weight after being starved and having access to enough food. 


These instances show us that anorexia can be induced and is certainly not something that spoiled "first world" people CHOOSE to do. It is a mental illness, where the brain and mind and the body affect the behavior of an individual to the point of self destruction. 


Think about that next time you make ignorant statements about something you have no idea about.  </TEXT>

Are you seriously making the "I didn't know sexually abusing my sister was wrong, because I grew up in a religious household" excuse for your despicable actions? COME ON MAN. Even at that age, and with very little sexual guidance from your parents or family (I'm sure they had sex ed at school), you should have known that touching someone without their consent, let alone them being younger than you AND YOUR SISTER is WRONG. You have to be an extremely ignorant person to believe that jerking off to a grown lady in a magazine is at the same level as raping your younger sister. 


I would have more sympathy for this post, but all you're doing is making excuses for your disgusting behavior and making yourself look like the victim. Oh I had to go to court and oh I had to do sex offender therapy, boo hoo! YES! All that stuff happened to you for a reason. You're a sex offender, plain and simple!! At least man the fuck up and stop making excuses as to why you did it, so you don't have a reason for doing it again.  </TEXT>

You might not be too keen on the idea but you can't just sit around and let the anger overtake you. You need to find a way to focus all of your energy and attention on something to release that anger. For me, that's running. People will suggest you talk to a doctor and get medication. Maybe that will work for you? Who knows? You gotta try things, see what helps you best. Don't let the anger and depression control your life! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I should know better. I'm a psych student. I know all of the symptoms. I see the parallels between what I've had to study and my own reality. 


I'm too fat in every mirror I look at, and yet everyone seems to be remarking on how thin I've gotten. It's none of their business though. Why are they so concerned??

I still get my period. It's not that bad. Not like last time. Last time, I lost my period and almost fainted in the bathroom. I had these little white hairs growing on my body to help me regulate my body temperature. I hate the cold.

For whatever reason, whenever I see a photograph of myself, I can see the thinness. I notice the gaunt, hollowness of the eyes that glare back at me. I'm shocked at the boniness of my arms and protruding collar bones. Where I once had pleasantly plump, youthful cheeks, I now have an angled downward frown, that never appears to be satisfied or happy. My teeth have a yellow stain that will likely never come off, because of all of the vomiting. I'm a hideous monster, and I can't stop. 


I hate how much I weigh. The scale is my best friend and my worst enemy. Two days ago, it was my best friend. I was 95. I checked today, I'm 98. This angers me. I reel in self loathing and intense disdain.


I always give in. I'll never be good enough. I'm always too weak. Why can't I just make it to 90?? I can stop there. It's a lie. I know it. I know what will happen after that.  </TEXT>
