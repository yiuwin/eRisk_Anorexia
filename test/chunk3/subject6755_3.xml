	<TITLE> My Analysis of "Emotion" (Human After All) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-17 01:45:48 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Here is my take on "Emotion," a wonderfully simple, yet complex song 

- The song begins with just a synthesizer, slightly dirty in tone and varied texture. Yet, this single voice sets the atmosphere of a distant memory: a scene where someone is contemplating a love in their life. The syncopation in the first measure with the ascending line creates a feeling of forward motion and unsettledness that finds peace in the next measure, where the melody is on the beat and resolves. This idea is repeated multiple times, really imprinting the melody into the song. It's important to note that the synth is panned to the right. 

- Next, the vocoder comes in, panned to the left to fill the whole void with sound. While the song is called "Emotion," and the lyrics are "emotion," it sounds as if the "e" in emotion has a slight "r" at the beginning, as if it is "remotion." This little detail, tied with the fact that the only lyric in the song is repeated throughout the song, creates this idea of that human emotion is cyclic and constantly repeated. 

- When the bass comes in with the upbeat vocoded guitar (I'm not 100% sure how they made the sound), the song becomes much more driven. The bass obviously creates the support for which the upbeat guitar part bounces off of, like a trampoline. Then another synth part enters with a slightly different melody than the first synth. The melody in the second synth much more optimistic, and even though the first synth is playing with its more contemplative nature, the optimism of the second synth takes over. It's as if someone broke up with a loved one, and one part of his or her consciousness is depressed with the fact, but the other part is optimistic for the future, and eventually this sorrowful scene becomes more peaceful. It's extremely apparent with only the synths and the lyrics are together. This feeling of "emotion" that is constant. 

- Now the drums come in with the rest of the ensemble, emphasizing the feeling of optimism. It's as if the music is saying, "Why be sad all the time? Be happy that you're alive, learn from your mistakes, and do the best with your life!" However, the song reverts to the original two voices, leading to the same progression as the beginning. This emphasizes this idea that we should be conscious of how we got to the where we are now, and we can't just be overcome by our emotions and forget the past. 

- While the outro of the song starts early and is repeated constantly, it creates a feeling of transcendence. The duo shows that we may have our problems, and that we may be emotional about it, but if we are optimistic and conscious of what has happened in the past, we can grow and become stronger individuals. It's the power of emotion, and the power of being human, after all. And thus the song fades, and the album ends. 

Hope you guys enjoyed it, and if you want, request what you would want me to do next! Once again, this is solely for discussion purposes and by no means is the only way to approach this piece of music.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love how they took something that is so iconic to the original song and turned it into something with a completely different feel. The melody is so sentimental and foreboding, but so beautiful. I think it's one of their trademark skills, exemplified in their live shows.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Analysis of "Get Lucky (feat. Pharrell Williams) [Daft Punk Remix]" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-16 02:48:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A fellow redditor asked for my full analysis of DP's remix of Get Lucky, so here it is! I don't know exactly how to format this, but hopefully it all makes sense.

- It begins with sampled drums, with an underlying tone that fluctuates in and out. The beat creates the feeling as if someone's heart is beating, while the tone is stagnant, like a frozen world. And then

- The piano coming with the full ensemble following afterwards. Unlike "Get Lucky," the chord progression in the remix follows an idea of tension-buildup -resolution-development. It's as if someone is questioning the world in which they live, and every time the answer is in sight, something comes up and tears down the hope. The guitar and bass line obviously create a disco-esque atmosphere that makes the listener want to dance. A dance of sadness. After this cycle continues, the piano cuts out with Pharell's entrance. The piano's chordal importance becomes evident, as the song loses its color and provokes a feeling of uncertainty. But we are guided, and "Like the legend of the phoenix" 

- "We're up all night to get lucky." The vocoder here is different from the original as well, beginning with the same sense of tension as the introduction, but eventually reaching a resolution and picking up a similar feel of rhythm and harmony as the original song. With the bass line supporting the vocoder melody, Pharell's vocals come back. The first time I listened to this track, I was amazed by how well Pharell's vocals fit with the vocoder. It makes the remix and the original equally more beautiful and how precise and calculated the music is.   

- The synthesizer kicks in with a constant line of descending notes that cycle around. The flow ebbs in and out, pulling you into the music as it generates a forward motion by ascending up the scale, a technique used by various composers, especially classical composers, that creates emphasis with a higher note. The drums are rather laid back at first, but kick into the trademark beat with the piano. 
 
- And so the remix goes back to the original vocal progression. But the colors, the emotions are different. Niles guitar track is missing, and so the dance feel is replaced by a feeling of relaxation and peace. Nile comes back with the pre-chorus, and so the groove is back in place. With the chorus, however, Pharell sings with the vocoder at the same time, a very beautiful juxtaposition. Afterwards, the remix plays around with different arrangements of the hook, pre-chorus, and chorus. Like I said before, the song becomes much more playful and optimistic, returning to the feel of the original song. Brings a smile to anyone's face  

- Interesting section that features the guitar, which eventually layers on the piano. The piano now, unlike the beginning, has a happier color than before. However, it slightly dies out in the final chord, foreshadowing the next theme.

- The vocoder comes back in with the synth, adding some intensity. Layering the bass and guitar back, the song begins to have more direction. Once the guitar drops out, the vocoder has its own little solo, creating a feeling as if its singing rather than taking words and making them sound like an instrument. Pharell returns with the hook and the layering returns. Very beautiful arrangement.  

- Now a different take on the hook of the song, where Pharell is sampled saying "lucky," as if the duo is emphasizing this idea that luck is what dictates our lives, and that we should not become power hungry control freaks. All we need is a little luck, and we're up all night to try and find that luck and have a good time. 

- We return back to the chord progression from the beginning. First we started with this tension, a little resolution, hope, happiness, and back to tension. The very nature of life. "Like the legend of the phoenix, or ends with beginnings, what keeps the planet spinning," the song's progression essentially is dictated by those first few lines. And so the vocoder comes back in, somewhat with a more crying quality in tonality, as if trying to fight this cycle of life that causes so much pain and suffering in the world. Just a little luck, and we can live happier lives. 

- The bell. The ominous bell. Each toll foreshadows the final progression of the song, creating a feeling of discomfort and seriousness. This seriousness is juxtaposed to Pharell's lyrics of having fun, getting some, etc. What's especially haunting is how the lyrics "to give up who we are" and "and our cups to the stars" are minor and descend. This creates sorrow, and almost even acceptance of this suffering. The bells and Pharell's happiness/sadness all mix together to create a scene of disparity that is covered over with lyrics of joy and fun, just how we may lie to ourselves to feel better, when in reality nothing is changing. 

- The outro begins with Pharell's final words: "or ends with beginnings." The whole song wrapped together in four words. While the song becomes much more serious in the end, a ray of hope shines distantly within the string section that plays. While we may all be in pain, we are working through it, and we are all alive, and that's what matters. Don't feel alone! And so the song fades out, like the sun finally setting upon the Earth and covering it in quiet darkness. 


Well, I hope you guys now have a different take on this song. This is solely my personal opinion, and thus does not mean that it's the only way to look at the song. The duo even said that they enjoy how people have different interpretations of their music anyway! If you guys want more of this, feel free to request anything! I'd love to do more of this kind of stuff and hear your guys' opinions as well!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The beauty of this song lies in the fact that it's meant to be different from what people expected. Contrasting the original with this remix, it's extremely obvious that the duo created a sorrowful, sentimental take of a song that is originally very upbeat and exciting (for example, the ominous bells later in the song are extremely haunting). I love this remix very much for many reasons, this would be a very long post if I analyzed the song fully, and I feel that people give it a bad rap because they thought it would be something they themselves wanted to hear, rather than what the duo wants the listener to feel and understanding.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My guess would be because of that cliche "he can't handle this sort of information" kinda stuff. How can he trust his hot-headed little boy to keep everything a secret? What if the government is secretly watching Eren without Dr. Jaeger knowing (brings up another conspiracy on the role of the government that is hinted throughout the story) and take Eren away? My best guess is that if Eren knew everything, he would become extremely protective of his own existence and thus never go into the line of battle. That would compromise the plan to have Eren become a titan and retake the walls.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I, personally, believe that it's to shed a little light on the titans, that they are as driven to "kill humans" as they are to just mutilate/eat. Why don't the titans constantly kill each other? Because they are usually equally powerful, and eating humans is a lot easier. We know very little of their behavior outside human encounters, so who knows how titans act naturally. [Manga Spoilers](/m "This is similar to the scene where Mike is killed, where the titans act like a bunch of children compared to the ape titan.") </TEXT>
