	<TEXT> Yes, people keep thinking I'm making a Bojack joke but she's an Asian rapper with very limited acting experience. Doesn't even have a picture on Wikipedia, which is why I find it weird that people think Rihanna doesn't belong with the others. She's at least extremely famous in North America.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I'm saying is that shows can still be good with laugh tracks, but they would still be improved by having it taken out in nearly, if not every instance. A laugh track just makes comedic timing a lot more difficult and accentuates any bad jokes that their might be (even in good shows). I loved That 70s Show, but I still constantly wished that I didn't have to listen to the obnoxious as fuck studio audience taking up 5 minutes of the 22 minute show by simply reacting.  </TEXT>
