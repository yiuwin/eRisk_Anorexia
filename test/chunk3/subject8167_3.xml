	<TEXT> That would be awesome. It'd be even cooler if it was based on "Long Haloween", cutting down on the gadgets and actually emphazing a players ability to think and act like a detective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As the first comic book I've ever read, I LOVED it. The storytelling, the 1940s gangster style theme, the mystery and showing batman as more a detective than solely relying on his tech, it just made me love Batman all that more. 

I'm looking forward to purchasing more such as the Killing Joke, and Hush.

What are, in your guy's opinions, the best DC comics you've read? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys,
I've always been a huge fan of Batman, especially the Nolanverse, but I want to look at some comics now. I've already read the Killing Joke as recommended by a friend, but I'm not sure what to read next and in what order?

Thanks in advance for any recommendations.

Edit: Preferably available digitally :) </TEXT>
