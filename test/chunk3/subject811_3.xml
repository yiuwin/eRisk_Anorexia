***Here are the numbers!***   

There are 850 GENERAL admission tickets and 50 VIP available!  

Although, VIP is already gone. 
  



**Edit:** ***All tickets are now sold out after 10-15min!***   

If any more tickets pop up we will be sure to let you know! Also, the band will keep people informed of anyone selling their pre-purchased items.  
Alternatively, you can post your ticket here under the circumstances that you can't make it to the show and would like to resell them. (This applies to ALL TWRP shows, not just the Toronto one.) We will not remove resell posts.  


And a big congrats to everyone who managed to purchase one! I hope to meet a bunch of you at the show :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a good point of view!  

Although, I'm sure being a part of GG as well as NSP is what's stopping them from doing these huge tours. They run more than one business which is crazy and means they have to cater to a lot of people...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For all of you guys just tuning in, the tickets for the NSP/TWRP show in Toronto ARE sold out. (Give or take a few GENERAL admission tickets.)

The ticket vendor may have released them too early because they were sold out before 11am even hit. 

I just want to stress that even though its extremely disappointing (trust me, I'm in the same boat!), Ninja Sex Party and TWRP had no knowledge that this would happen. This wasn't their responsibility.

Theyre looking into finding a solution but just remember, through all of this frustration, this was not under NSP/TWRPs control! Try to be civil about the whole thing.

Thanks guys!  

If anything pops up again, [here is a direct link to the ticket vendor.](https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1244049)

	<TEXT> I think they'll be announcing the Canadian dates soon, no full confirmation on where they're going yet. You should even consider checking out r/TWRP! We try to keep tour dates updated and chances are, NSP will be joining them if they're ever in Canada. (Also, sometimes they announce things before NSP get the chance to.) </TEXT>
