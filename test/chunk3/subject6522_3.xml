	<TEXT> We both like writing and watching cartoons. But most recently, we watch GMA's Destined To Be Yours and talk about the episode over on FB. We both know it's a mediocre show but it's our guilty pleasure to just watch it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Will do haha. I've had MUs before pero never ko nanligaw kasi takot ako sa (not what you're thinking) rejection. Di sa mahangin pero aminado naman akong may itsura ako haha but I dunno. I just don't know what to do next with my life if she ever says no. But I'm telling you, she's different. My favorite part when talking to her is when we discuss how sad and gloomy the world is. I guess we share a melancholic perspective in life. Maybe that's why I like her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NGSB here. I've had a crush on my classmate since last semester. Pa on/off yung crush ko sa kanya cos everytime may maliit na incovenience between us, bigla ako nag e-eject sa kanya but when something good happens like inaya nya ako kumaen or when she just smiles at me, all my feelings for her comes rushing back to me. Recently, ang consistent na ng bonding namen. Nakapunta na kame sa Rizal Park, hinahatid ko sya sa LRT. Soooo... I was just wondering kung is it the right time na ba para manligaw? Let me add lang din na super torpe kaming both kaya asar samen madalas ng tropa namen na nag aantayan lang kame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Watched it last night. It's too cliche and formulaic in my very honest opinion. You've seen this kind of show before. But damn, si Maine ang nagbubuhat sa cast. She just brings this kind of charisma sa show.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I cannot recommend Strike Back enough. Every episode has an intense amount of action. As I've read before here, think of it as 24 on cocaine with nudes! Also, it's on Cinemax. The same channel that brought you Banshee. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When he was still in the closet (even though it was so obvious from the day I met him), he was just so normal and a friend that you could hang out with anytime. But after coming out, he became more "aggressive" with his sexuality. He'd check out guys and hang out with the gay clique more often. Maybe I just feel jealous considering that we've been good friends since last year then suddenly he leaves me and the tropa hanging. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been there. A year and a half naman tinagal ng pagiging "out-of-school youth" ko. Not to be overdramatic but the thought of purposeless and pagiging sloth ko sa bahay gave me depression. You're lucky your parents are still there for you. All you have to do is to find something to make you happy. Try bonding more with your family. </TEXT>
