	<TEXT> I think people give the general government way too much credit with these things. 
I do believe it was a false flag attack to get our guns taken away, but I think it was done by CIA/secret government groups. 
Same thing with the shootings lately, maybe not all of them, but I think many are "tests". How far can they go, which demographic gets the most coverage, how long do people remember it, and how can they change people's minds about gun safety. I believe they use a combination of special agents and ritual abuse victims to carry out the attacks. 
It's really not that far of a stretch, they already monitor pretty much everything we do/say. They use the NSA to track "terrorists" and "extremists" aka anyone that's anti establishment (among other things). Take away everyone's guns and who's going to stop them from rounding us all up in the name of national security/protection. Obama already passed a law where he can indefinitely detain US citizens, I think they're just waiting. Maybe they're waiting for inevitable financial collapse, maybe they're waiting until everyone finally agrees to give up their guns, maybe this is just a crazy theory that will never manifest itself publicly. I don't know, but it's interesting to consider.  </TEXT>
