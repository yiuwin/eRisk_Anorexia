	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I decided to stop hrt after 4months but i don't know if I should have.  I stopping mainly because even pre hrt I talked to more guys and it seams a lot of people my age talk to mostly girls. Also because people my age social transition early and most before hrt and I can't even do that I keep putting it off. And it also lead to me start to cutting over depression and feeling like hrt was not working snd that I will never be passable. So did I make the right choice or did I make the wrong decision? And are my fears just fears?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well before they will give you hrt there you need to meet with the person that does intakes they will just ask you some questions and that then you will be able to meet with the nurse ( there the ones that prescribe the hrt) For that it took me around 1-2 months tho it depends on cancelations and sometimes the nurse won't be there so you appt will be canceled happened to me twice.  And if you live far away  the nurse will work with you.My over all experience there everybody is nice never had any problems.  </TEXT>

By this time I will be full time and hopefuly have my name and gender marker changed.Its just that I don't want to have to be a guy for the whole time and pretend something that I am not. He knows I am trans we have talked about it once brefily and since that we have not talked about it at all what should I do should I just go through with it as its only one night or what?   </TEXT>
