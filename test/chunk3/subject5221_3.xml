	<TEXT> I was thinking of upgrading to 16gb but i think that could wait until the end of the year. I don't see it as a necessity in 2015 but I'll definitely get 16gb until beginning of 2016 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So guys this is my first post ever so don't get mad at me because i am not used to the PCMasterRace community.
I have been a glorious Pc Gamer since i was 5 had 3 PC's before the current one. None of those ones were built by me. But this PC that i built in November 2014 was the first PC that i built and documented all by myself on what to buy and all that fun stuff and well it turned out pretty well keeping it nice and cleaning it once a month. But i kinda made an obsession with PC's in the last half a year and thought that i could upgrade my battlestation. The problem is i am very skeptical about what i should upgrade first. 

 I have some ideas but i want you to help me choose.

- New power supply because i am worried if i upgrade anything that will drain any more power i will be on a limit
- Water cooling for the CPU... Not really sure if i could water cool my graphics card because it is a Phantom variation of the 970 and i haven't really found any compatible water blocks
- New fans because the ones in my Zalman Z11 are kind of noisy but not that big of a problem as i am a big headphone user

Down here are my PC specs and i'd love if you could help me decide what the priorities would be and if you could recommend specific parts for those upgrades and even suggest any other upgrade ideas.

I should note that i am not looking for aesthetics as much as i am looking for performance.

My temps on full load GTA 5 (sorry for mainstream game of reference) in the winter or colder days are a steady 70 celsius for the Graphics card and in the summer or hotter days never been more than 85. And for my cpu in cold days around 50 celsius and in hotter days around 60 65.
