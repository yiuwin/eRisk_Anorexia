	<TEXT> I think a great director for the Cyborg movie, coming out in 2020, is Alex Garland. He knows how to balance out visual narratives and make it interesting/fun for his viewers. He has a clear passion for movies and video games, particularly for science fiction. With his contributions to movies like Ex Machina and Dredd, I think his interpretation of a live-action Cyborg movie would satisfy critics and audiences alike. An android's struggle to be perceived as a human being would be a great stepping stone for a human's struggle to not conform fully to his cybernetic ways. Like Ray Fisher put it.

What are your guys' opinions? Do you agree? Disagree? Any other directorial considerations? Let me know, I am more than curious. </TEXT>
