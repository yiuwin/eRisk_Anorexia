	<TEXT> I'm not sure what's happening. Both of these devices worked fine with my N5. My mi band is partially connected, as in it'll sync and notify me but it won't work as a trusted device for unlocking. I thought maybe it was just an OS issue for the mi band.

What's really annoying is there phone won't detect my UE mini boom speaker. I get random addresses pop up sometimes for the band and speaker, but those don't work. Any thoughts?

Edit: Well I just tried it with my old $5 Bluetooth speaker and it paired in seconds... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll basically copy and paste what I said to another user. I had to make the same decision:

It's going to depend on what you want in a phone. Do you care at all for a slide out keyboard? A lot of comments I'm seeing are that while it's nice to have a physical keyboard again, most people have become accustomed to an on screen keyboard. Especially those that use swipe typing. Personally, I think I could type out a quick message much faster with swipe than I could tapping keys on a physical keyboard.

Next, is the higher price of the Priv a factor? What about camera? Early reviews indicate the 6P is the clear winner in the camera department. Do you want timely OS updates done by Google or wait an undetermined amount of time for BlackBerry?

Finally, something I had to weigh in my consideration. This is BlackBerry's final effort. If it fails, will they still provide continued support? You know Google will, furthermore, there's always the developer community and we all know Nexus devices receive much love from 3rd party developers.

To me it became a no brainer, so I went with the 6P. Good luck in your decision!

	<TEXT> Up until August I had a grandfathered family plan with two $30/6gb addons. I switched to a loyalty plan for $110+tax for 10gb shared family plan. Paying just a bit less than before and I get NHL game center "free". I noticed a couple weeks ago that they screwed up the plan change and since what I was quoted was documented they were quick to fix it and offer me credits. Got the 6P essentially for free, plan is now $130+tax and they included two years of Spotify. The credit I received was substantial, I was still able to apply $72 worth of Rogers Reward points on the HUP.

Long story short, I've been with them for 14 years, they've never mistreated us and are always quick to fix my issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends really. I prefer the lower upfront cost. I'm quite happy with my carrier. It's only an additional $20 a month and I keep my same plan. I got a bonus offer from Rogers in my situation so I'm not even paying the $199. 

The phone would have been $699 via Google. Instead you can pay $199, +$480 over 24 months. If I want to leave Rogers for whatever reason I just pay the amount owing on the $480. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ordered a battery for my Nexus 5 from amazon.ca yesterday. I'm doubtful it's an official OEM from LG, but reviews were mostly positive. Figured it couldn't hurt for just $10. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I've resolved myself to waiting for the 820 phones. I don't feel 2015 was particularly good for phones. I'm banking on LG making a kick ass G5 with the SD820. Keep up with the removable battery and SD slot and they have me sold. Getting a new battery for my Nexus 5 in the meantime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well Rogers has preorders for the graphite 32gb 6P for $199 on a 2yr plan. I'm sure there will be some discounts near Christmas too. In 2013 I got my N5 for $0 on a 2yr during a black Friday sale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be absurd for them not to include the LED light on the 5X. I'm seriously hoping it's just an oversight on the spec sheet. Since when are the notification lights listed anyways? Regardless, I've basically dismissed the 5X as a marginal upgrade to the 5. 6P is looking great though. </TEXT>

Seriously though, you can check DBXstore for a cheap screen replacement if you think you can do it yourself. Screw these overpriced phones. Our N5's will live on! (Maybe after I replace my battery though :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Going to agree here. 5X is a marginal upgrade to the N5. 6P is looking good, even with the missing features you mentioned. No OIS doesn't mean camera will be shit. I've never used wireless charging and I've lived on 16gb since my iPhone 3GS. Only the Canadian pricing will be the determining factor for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It feels, as a collective, all the OEMs are aiming to disappoint us this year and lower our expectations in advance of next year's phone line up. Feels almost prudent to just keep waiting until next year.

	<TEXT> Canadian here. It's even worse for us. We have to determine the price in CAD through some convoluted mathematical equation that no one really understands, then add an average of 15% tax on top of that. $599 CAD for the 6P is the best we can hope for. </TEXT>

Almost all the carriers had the 5 and 6. I'd be surprised if they didn't get them again. I'm banking on Rogers to either get the Nexus 5X/6P or Xperia Z5. </TEXT>
