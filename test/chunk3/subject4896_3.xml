	<TEXT> I think catch-up mechanics should be optional (could be on by default). You could always build big army of outdated troops and try to conquer weaker AIs so you could catch-up naturaly without this catch-up "cheats". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are many more differences. The most important is that Civilization is 4X game while EU4 is grand strategy. The gameplay is so much different between these two games. I don't like that in EU4 everything is determined - the world is always the same, you cannot improve terrain and thus it looks bland on map, every province seems to be almost the same. The depth is only within empire management which consists mostly of numbers, while in Civ you can see most of the improvements on map, your army is much more diversified. It's just more colorful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But as far as I can remember Civ I-IV didn't have such balances and were a lot of fun to play. I just don't like this modern game design that forces you to win. It's similar in racers when you are falling behind opponents the game artificially slows downs them so you can catch up. Where is the challenge in this? Where is the fun? Well... I guess I am just too old :/ </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why are there so many balances and "scale with eras" in civ design? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I mean isn't the world unbalanced by nature? I think that too much balance kills the enjoyment or playing and exploring the world. Why techs from era behind gets less expensive when you enter new era?Why districts costs scale with eras? Why techs gets more expensive the more cities you get? Why less advantaged civs gets boost to science just to not fall behind? I mean there are still tribes in Africa or on some islands that live almost in stone age. I think that this gamey balances ruins all the fun tbh. </TEXT>
