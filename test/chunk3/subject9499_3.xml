	<TEXT> A couple of week ago I(f) had a fall and ended up getting some grazes on various parts of my body. Thinking that I might've seriously hurt something a went to a nearby doctor just to get check out. 

After inspecting my various grazes he looks at the one's on my knees and says "I'm pretty sure those one's are carpet burn if you get what I'm saying". It took him a couple of minutes to realise what he said but by then I was already on my way out. </TEXT>
