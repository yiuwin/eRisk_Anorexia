	<TEXT> About 196 hours, but I did take a little bit of time off of completion so I could farm up Ether Blossom (with 600+ potential) and a custom skell, so it may take you a bit less time. You will have to spend a fair bit of time (a metric fuckton) farming to take on the harder content tho. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would recommend using the Global Nemeses for practice, they're excellent meatbags, and they don't do very much damage, so they can be forgiving if you mess up a combo. It's pretty much just muscle memory, although a few specific tyrants require you to switch up your art rotations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to tell you this right now, it can be very hard to go back to the original, since some of the menus and organizational structures were revamped for X, and the battle system is extremely different, actually forcing you to rely on your other party members since Overdrive's insane CDR doesn't exist, also, this is just my opinion, but the combat did not age well either, and the quest markers and story memo indicators can be very finnicky. That said, the original is still a worthwhile investment, but it will take a little bit of patience to get used to its antiquated system. That said, this is just my opinion, and is shared by a few other people both on the sub and IRL. Hope this helped to prepare you for your journey across Bionis and Mechonis!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, assuming I went with an ether javelin build, what arts would I use, since so many of them have a fixed electric elemental damage? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Instead of going to the Noctilescent Sphere go to FN site 505 and kill the visigels in that area, there are around 10 in a close range to the probe </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just stack ether resist on ur armor, and make sure to break the tail first and use long animation arts when he throws out Multi Ether Laser (ground phase) cuz it topples and you're immune to status effects while in art animations, and when you're back in the sky, watch out for seductive mind, as it inflicts sleep. Evasion isn't really necessary as you can mitigate his ether damage to one, and breaking the tail and avoiding topple essentially keeps it from using non-ether arts (except for collider X but it only does like 3k damage) </TEXT>
