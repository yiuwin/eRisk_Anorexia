	<TEXT> Not all of us think like that. I know damn well it's none of my business what anyone else wants to do with their life and that no one has any right to harass someone over their life choices, and that there are infinitely many different ways to live and that all of them are ok (so long as nobody else is being harmed). And I want to live my life for me, not to be a cookie-cutter. I know what will make me happy. I want to be a tattoo artist and a wife and the only baby we will have will be a hairless cat named Alec. I will not be a "happy" (read: drained and defeated) suburban stay at home mom with 3 kids and a minivan and no time for myself with that stereotypical mom haircut (you know the one I'm taking about) and dead eyes and a broken spirit. 

I have noticed that a lot of us are like that though. I remember the horrified looks my friends gave me when one of them asked what I was going to name my kids and I told them I wasn't going to have any. 

I think a lot of that is just because they want to fit in though. Nobody wants to be the outlier, that can be rough. We want to be accepted, we want to have a group, we want to be wanted. And sometimes it seems like the best way to do that is to be like the majority, or at least pretend to be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also tend to hide from other people...they all seem like monsters to me. "The marks humans leave are too often scars". That quote basically sums up my entire existence. It's just hiding, hurting, hating. And trying so fucking hard but nobody caring. Life is rough. I hear you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this truth is very relevant to the fact that the majority of victims of child molestation and such are subjected to those things by their own parents or another figure of authority (another older family member, a teacher, a doctor).They want to own something. They want power. They see the child as an extension of themself. 

Of course this doesn't apply to *all* parents or other people of authority, but it is a contributor to those who it does apply to, I think.

Either way, whether they're treating the kid like a pet or like a plaything it's wrong, because it is a human being, but obviously the parents who see their child as a pet are *infinitely* better than the ones who see their child as an object to be used for sexual shit. Same with anyone else who is in position of power over the child. Obsessed baby-crazy mombie is way better than a pedo-mombie, but it does seem that the same mentality is present in both types. They treat it like it exists only as a source of pleasure and accomplishment to them, except to one it is a fuck-trophy, a "look what I squeezed out of my vagina! Yay me!" thing and they mold it into the being they want it to be, but to the monster one it is a conquest. Children are easy to control, don't always understand what's happening, so sadly they are easy to take advantage of. 

That's my take on that sort of ideology anyway, I'm just going on what I've learned about the psychology of sexual predators from trying to sort out what happened when I was assaulted myself though. I'm not a professional or anything though, this is just my take on the matter. I've just picked up quite a bit about *why* those things happen. I tend to use that *why* knowledge to cope. It wasn't me. I didn't do anything wrong. I was just in a position of weakness (a position a child is almost always in) and a sick fuck who wanted to feel in control used me to get that feeling. I'm kind of just rambling now though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't decide so I'll give you my top 5:

Taco Bell- Bean burrito with no onions (just beans, cheese, and red sauce) or chicken quasarito with just the chicken, rice, and cheese and a diet Mountain Dew.

Wendy's- Spicy chicken sandwich with just the chicken, lettuce, and cheese and a Sprite Zero or a lemonade if it's that season. 

Burger King- Buffalo chicken fries with French fries and either a diet coke or a milkshake with no whip cream or cherry, the flavour depending on my mood. 

Popeyes- The box containing 3 prices of spicy chicken, Cajun fries, and a biscuit. 

McDonald's- Buttermilk chicken sandwich with just lettuce and cheese and the meat with fries and a Coke zero or ten chicken mcnuggets with fries and the same drink, which I save like half of for later.  </TEXT>

I think in a couple of years when I can decide for myself I'll start trying to find a therapist I can work with but I'm kind of uncertain about it because sometimes it seems like it's just a negative thing to me now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't want to take them in the first place. I was forced to by my parents after a (once again forced) stay in a psychiatric hospital. I was young and a mess and they didn't want to deal with it so they decided they should fuck with my brain chemistry instead. The meds made me feel even worse. I couldn't feel *anything*. I always felt like I was under water, isolated, unreal. I just started hiding them instead of taking them and then when it was time to refill them I pitched a fit and I got them to tell my doctor not to bother anymore, they weren't helping. 
I sometimes I wish I'd stayed on them. Saved them up for the times I'd need them. Something really horrible was done to me while I was in the hospital that's kind of fucked me up forever and I think it might be nice to have some meds to pop when the flashbacks come.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just love how all of the SJWs arguments invalidate at least one of their other own arguments. By saying that attraction is a learned behavior, they are undermining their argument that being gay is *not* a choice, when in reality, it is that both are not a choice, they just happen. Who you're attracted to is just a thing. It's not learned. It's just what an individual finds aesthetically pleasing and which gender or genders they are naturally attracted to. "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." It's not racist to find people who look a certain way more attractive. Some people like straight hair, some people like curly hair. Some people like green eyes, some people like brown eyes, some people like pale skin, some people like dark skin. Finding a certain skin tone more attractive is no different than having a preference as to what height you find most attractive. Being attracted to people with a certain physical build isn't discrimination either. It's just individual preference. Being attracted to thin girls isn't fat-hate. Being attracted to thick girls isn't skinny-hate. Being attracted to lean guys isn't fat-hate. Being attracted to big guys isn't thin-hate. Finding pale skin beautiful isn't racism. Finding dark skin beautiful isn't racism either. 

It's not ok to tell people who they're allowed to be attracted to. Isn't that what these SJWs try to say all the time? They are hypocrites. They only care if it effects them. Being attracted to people of a different race or weight or whatever than them is wrong, but being exclusively attracted to that race or weight or whatever of theirs is *the only right type to be attracted to*. Such hypocrites.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't like how they use the word "conforms". It makes it sound as though cis people make a conscious effort to be cis, when in reality, it's not like that. It's like how people don't *choose* to be gay or trans. It's just how they are. I was born a female, and I have the heart and soul of a female. I didn't *comform* to my biological body, it's just how I am. I do feel lucky to have been born in a body that suits me though. It seems truly frustrating to be transsexual. But who ever made that paper saying that cis people *conform* to be cis seems hypocritical. They say trans isn't a choice, it's how they were born inside. It's the same for cis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh, this sort of reminds me of when I was in an eating disorder treatment center and the psychiatrists kept trying to use the possibility of infertility to scare me straight or whatever. They were all "but anorexia can cause infertility! If you don't stop you might *never be able to bear children*" and that was basically what they based every single session on. How I wouldn't be able to have a faaaaaamily if I didn't recover. Not on, you know, actual issues but on trying to convince me to eat normally, not for my own life, but for the lives of my future children that do not and never will exist. I wanted to tell them that infertility would actually be a welcome gift and in no way was a motivator to recover. But oh well. I guess I learned that *my* life doesn't matter, just my ability to bear critchfruit. I guess it's not that similar but it's the same sort of unprofessional psychiatrist trying to force the idea of baaaaaaybeeeeees. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was one of the doctors in an eating disorder treatment center I was (involuntarily) admitted too...it was on the first night I was there, I didn't arrive until like a little after 2 a.m. and after a long and humiliating process of invasive and frankly inappropriate questions (I'm quite sure it was in no way allowed or part of procedure to ask things like that, but it had started out normally but just got wrong eventually) the doctor just...did it. I was so shocked I kind of just froze up, I didn't even try to fight except for brushing away her hand when she first started...I will always be so mad at myself for that. 

And sadly I am a coward who didn't even look at her face or hear her name. I spent my whole two-week stay trying to figure out which one it was (there were 4 doctors, or technically psychiatrists so they doubled as the medical and mental doctors, 3 females and 1 male but I obviously knew it wasn't him) had done it. It was really frustrating being in a treatment center and made to talk with the 3 female doctors in therapy sessions during my stay (they never let me talk to the man which was so upsetting because I'm kind of terrified of females since immediatly after that happened). It was the worst when during a session one of the doctors asked me if I had ever experienced any sexual violence and I couldn't say anything...

I'm very sorry I've written so much and really over-explained it but I just rarely get to talk about this and it really helps to and I'm sorry if it's jumbled or rambley or confusing or stupid, I am not very articulate but it's like when I'm writing it out it's not a part of me anymore and it just makes me feel at peace for a bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's also really hard to be taken seriously if it was a women who did the assault, regardless of your own gender because of how many people don't think women ever commit sexual crimes. I'm a women myself but I've had to start avoiding gender pronouns in regard to the person who hurt me to avoid being disregarded. I can't stand to hear "Women do not do that, you're lying" again. But at least I can just be non-specific as to the gender of my attacker and no one really questions me, except for the fact that it was a doctor, so they use that as an excuse too. It's rough on every victim though, but being told that it doesn't matter or couldn't have happen just because of the gender of the person who did it is awful too. I wish the myths that all of the people who commit these crimes are men would just go away.  </TEXT>

I think it may be similar to what male victims have to deal with though. I am very happy if I'm raising awareness for male victims too. No one should have to feel like they have to be ashamed or have to keep quite just because of their gender or the gender of the person who hurt them. I want to help raise awareness for *everyone* who's been hurt like that and try to end victim-discrimination.  </TEXT>
