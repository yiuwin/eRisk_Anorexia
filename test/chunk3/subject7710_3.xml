	<TEXT> I see. Just based on the properties I know of, the two tax returns I've seen, and the few accounts I have had a peek at, I think my dad is somewhere in the 40m+ range and his annual income (not including gains) is ~1m. 

Based on the company events I've been, I'd say my dad is pretty average. That being said, he is the mid-50s and looks well past retirement. He has seriously high blood pressure and his *hobbies* consist of praying, reading, and sleeping 3 hours a night. The stress is intense, but he truly loves finance. 

On the one hand, I feel pressured to at least meet my dad's level of success and not live in his shadow, on the other hand, I feel like I will never have a shortage of cash and should enjoy it. Although, that would seriously disappoint him. I don't have any passion for finance and want a PhD in econ. I want to be a professor. Again, thanks so much for your guidance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really? Not denying it, but I checked karmadecay and searched for it, didn't see anything similar. Do you mind providing a link please? I searched r/oddlysatisfying for *bricklaying*, but I guess I should have searched it for *bricks*. Even still, doing that shows the most recent submission of this content at [5 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/search?q=brick sort=new restrict_sr=on t=all). I also don't seem to see it in the top 100.

Thank you,

	<TEXT> Gem collector here: I also *fucking love corundum*, it's gorgeous. Especially ruby. 

Here are a few tips:

The 4 Cs are important....but not nearly as important as P.T.C when it comes to cost. What are *P.T.C.*?

**P**lace: The outlet from which you purchase the stone. Online will be way cheaper than a Jewelry store. eBay will be way cheaper than a gem website (usually), etc. 

**Treatments**: Definitely the most important factor when it comes to corundum value. An unheated stone, especially a blue sapphire or ruby is VERY expensive. hundreds to million+ per carat. Lead glass filled stones are worth around $1 per carat and are not considered true gemstones. 

**C**ertification: Look for stones with reports from reputable laboratories (GIA, AGL, GRS, SSEF, etc.)

**Color**: Look for the best tone and saturation of color. Choose the color you like, not the *ideal*. 

**Cut**: The most important and overlooked factor. Look for symmetrical, even cuts with good polishing and finishing. 

**Clarity**: An opaque corundum is almost worthless (unless it's a star). Look for transparent stones free of large or unsightly inclusions. 

**Carat**: Larger stones are much more expensive than smaller stones of similar quality.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gemological have a vast amount of knowledge in identifying and grading gemstones based on the "4 C's" of quality. The "4 C's" are Cut, Color, Clarity, and carat weight. As well as treatments and origin. I'll use ruby as an example. 

**Cut:** Cut is not only the shape of the stone (pear, rectangle, round, etc.), but also how well it is cut. Certain proportions give a much more brilliant appearance. It also takes into consideration the symmetry, polish, and overall cut quality.

  It is a very important factor and gemstones that are good overall, but have a poor cut often have to be recut to maximizr value.

**Color:** This is perhaps the most important factor in evaluating colored gemstones. A perfect red ruby is extremely rare, it almost always mixed with pink, purple, brown, or orange. The pure color comes from pure crystal. Nature is almost never this simple. 

**Clarity:** The first step of establishing clarity is the transparency. Most gemstones must transparent to be considered a true gem (with exceptions such as jadeite). Ruby is almost never considered a gem if it is semitransparent, translucent, or opaque, with the exception being star rubies, but that's a whole different topic. 

Once a stone has been established as transparent, the clarity comes down to the level of natural scratches, bumps, pits, surchface blemishes, and internal inclusions. Inclusions are from foreign objects entering the host crystal. If you see a large ruby with no inclusions, chances are it's heavily treated or synthetic. 

**Carat** A 10 ct stone will generally be worth much more than 10 times more than a 5 ct stone of the same characteristics. Every additional carat weight makes stones much, much rarer. Especially ruby. 1 carat = 0.2 grams. The highest selling price per ruby was over $1,000,000/carat for an almost 30 CT Ruby (The Sunrise Ruby). 

**Treatments** 99% of ruby and a significant portion of all gmestones are treated. The most common enhancement is heating. Heating the gemstone melts the inclusions making the stone more clean and transparent. 

Other inclusions include heating with beryllium diffusion. Some treatments involve filling the fractures with lead glass. These lead glass filled stones are not considered gems and can be purchased for $1/carat since they are just a mix of gemish material and glass, not a true gem. 

An untreated stone will lead be worth much, much more than an untreated stone of the same quality. 

**Origin** Depending on the stone, a rare or important source can considerably increase the value. Burma (Myanmar) for rubies. Kashmir (India/Pakistan) for sapphires, Muzo (a mine in Colombia) for emeralds, Lightning Ridge (Australia) for opal, etc.

	<TEXT> Yes and no. The problem with diamonds are the jewelry stores. Their markups make De Beers seem like a nonprofit. 300-500% is common for a normal store (with room for negotiation, of course). 10,000%+ for Cartier, Harry Winston, VCA, Tiffany, etc. To be fair, those brands will hold their value better than almost any jewelers. 

The trick is to buy from websites like BlueNile and eBay. Wholesalers sell direct for as low as 5% markup. They say they won't, but they almost will negotiate if you bring them a real offer.

Diamonds are not inherently rare...in small sizes, but large diamonds are VERY rare. Fancy colored diamonds are EXTREMELY rare. Top color, cut, clarity, large diamonds are the rarest of all. 

Furthermore, the mining process is very expensive compared to most gemstones. Overall, there is a lot of marketing inflation, but they do have intrinsic value when purchased wholesale or second hand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn, that's a tough one. I love those real, vibrant rubies, and the green of a good emerald can make your heart stop, but for me, it's jadeite. The depth of color is deeper than emerald. That perfect green with semi-transparency, it almost seems to glow. 

Imperial jadeite looks like it's an alien object on this planet. [Example](https://www.gia.edu/images/154474_468x468_1355961836612.jpg) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oddly enough, several shows are being marketed as Netflix originals, even though they're airing on TV first. Case in point, Riverdale. It's amazing how much times have changed. Netflix has a bigger reach than any one channel, and many cable providers as well. My dad bought Netflix stock in 2009...Let's just say, he can retire early. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To start, I am a collector only, not a dealer. I collect mostly the big 4: diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. I also love opal and jadeite. 

My total collection is somewhere in the $650k USD range (pretty low by high-end standards). After I finish my degree, I plan on pursuing on becoming a GIA graduate gemologist and traveling to the gem trading hotspots of the word (Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, Tanzania, Brazil etc.). 

I have been inside an emerald mine in Colombia and held a stone that later sold for $20M+ at auction, ask me anything! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone watching this? It's a Canadian show. I'm sure many of you have read Anne of Green Gables as a kid, and this show does it justice in my opinion. The reviews are quite good and in-depth, so I'll keep this post brief. 

Cast: The acting is solid, especially the little girl playing Anne. 

Writing: Sharp, witty, believable. 

Production: Wow. I feel like I live in a village in P.E.I during the 1800s. The landscapes are spectacular. 

Definitely worth a watch. Thoughts? </TEXT>

Sounds great, look forward to it! I'll return the favor when my ammolite arrives (I have a few specimens at home, but I'm at college right now and it's too close to finals to go home).

	<TEXT> Matrix Opal --- (Type 3 Opal)

"Matrix opal" is a term used for rough or finished gemstones in which precious opal is in an intimate mixture with the parent rock instead of the opal being confined to seams and patches as in boulder opal. The specimen on the left is a cabochon cut from matrix opal mined at Andamooka, Australia.

http://geology.com/gemstones/opal/

This specific matrix opal is black because it has been boiled with sugar and HCL acid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not just about flash. A big thing is whether it is a solid stone, a doublet, or a triplet. Another thing is the number of different colors. There are a lot of factors. $250 is reasonable for a mineral show and $1000+ is reasonable for an auction or high-end jeweler.  </TEXT>

Their apartment is crap because they spend their money on booze and fun rather than their living space. </TEXT>
