	<TEXT> Hey, thanks for the response.  The biggest anxiety issue for me I think is socially.  I just sit in class and feel so shitty bevause everyone has friends and people to talk to and I'm scared to even ask a relevant question.  It makes me feel so isolated and alone.  :/  Relate at all? </TEXT>
