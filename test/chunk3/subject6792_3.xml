	<TEXT> This group will Ultimately fail.  This is what happens when a United States label combines forces with an asian label.  Remember the disaster Rania's debut was when Teddy Riley was at the helm?  The United States label will not understand why they are getting banned or ask to censor their dances on the Korean Music Shows.  The United States label people really need to do their research on Korean Society before venturing into that territory before trying to attempt something like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow the people on allkpop are pretty ruthless with their comments about t'ara.

Problem with t'ara is their current management company.

The CEO really knows how to make things worse than they really are.  He has done nothing but damage their reputation ever since the "scandal" got into the netizens hands.

	<TEXT> I agree with all your points.

Just trying to swim through the posts lately on the KPOP reddit was a chore.

We learn from mistakes.. I know this first hand.. My first post on the KPOP reddit was either moved or deleted because I didn't read the rules.  Once I read the rules and I was told why my post was deleted or moved (I can't remember which) I have had no problems posting here.
