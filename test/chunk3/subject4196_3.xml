	<TEXT> Ah ok nice, I used to paint a lot with oil paints and a little bit with water color but water colors tend to screw up my line work, so for my style Copics are like God sent. I have this little window every morning before work when I can draw in this style so that also makes the markers a great choice for me. I wonder if we have used the same kind of copics because the once I use blend suuuper nice, they just flow into each other. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I would say the straight opposite. The copic markers I use blends smooth as hell, its like painting with very controlled water colors. I can get super strong colors, I however often try to tone them down as I like that more. The only thin I agree on is that they are a bit pricey. I would agree on all points if we where talking about any other brand of markers as they fit your description perfectly. What medium do you like to work in?

	<TEXT> Its just simple cheap color pencils but you can work magic with them. But if you are already very skilled with colors and know what you are doing then I recommend copics as they speed up the process. They run dry very fast though and are very expensive. I would never use them if I was on a tight budget. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you (Im a sir)
I used to draw a lot digitally a couple of years back but I sort of realized that digital art looses the soul of the artist. Then I found my grand grandfather's sketchbook from when he was young and that inspired me. The effort he put into his pages inspired me to make every page count plus that feeling of somebody finding my sketchbooks in a 100 years is a bit thrilling haha. Hope they have a blast looking trough them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes there is such a thing as marker paper, however the paper I use is just labeled "sketchbook". I have bought and tried so many sketchbooks before I found the combination I was happy with, So I guess its just trial and error until you find yours.
My particular sketchbook is from a Swedish paper company that is only sold in Sweden sadly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much all my drawings happen like this. I stare at the paper until I get a little glimpse of something and then it just comes to life by its own somehow. What is very well thought out is the balance of it and the coloring. I just keep balancing colors and shapes until it sort of resembles what I was going for. 
I draw the base design with a ballpoint pen without sketching anything out first, so I embed all the misstakes I do into the final design and that adds soul to it.

Did that answer your question?  </TEXT>
