	<TEXT> I am a hunter lvl 28, only have one character.  I CANNOT use ANY consumables.  I never have been.   Anytime I try, the icon (any consumable i try to choose) flashes red for a brief second and thats it.  touching x, holding x, etc doesn't change a thing.  I tried moving all consumables to the vault...then putting them back in my inventory, and nothing changes.  I can't use them in the tower, in orbit, patrolling, striking, raiding or storying.  Any help/thoughts are appreciated. </TEXT>
