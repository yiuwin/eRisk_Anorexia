	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My school is a pretty normal school. Not much funny business happens, the town is moderately large, boasting about 100K people, and we neighbour another town. For reasons that will become obvious soon, I will not be disclosing the name and exact location of my town, but will give key points.

I live in a town in north Auckland, New Zealand. My school is a secondary school, coupling Intermediate and High school. I am a 16-year-old student in Year 11, (2 years before I can leave for University) and have a couple of friends, nothing too large. So, enough rambling. Heres the strange bit. 

Our caretaker (Groundskeeper, Janitor etc.) rides a little tractor thing that I cant find ANY images of and its parked underneath the gym. So, me and my friends were walking and talking, as you do, and while we were walking, Jennifer (name changed) and Rachel (Name changed) just stopped. They said something metal was there. Here is the Conversation, J and R represent them, M represents Marie (name changed) and L represents me.

L: Why did you guys stop?

M: Yeawhat did you forget?

(Its worth noting that Rachel and Jennifer are both kinda forgetful)

J: NothingIts like

R: Somethings here?

J: Yea!

L: Theres nothing there.

R: No. Its definitely there. It seemsmetallic

So, I walk over and obviously, I hit the thing. It felt like metal, but it had this rubbery texture to it that I couldnt describe fully even if I tried my hardest using my knowledge of the English language and a thesaurus. The closest description I could give is a Rubber metal with a kind of field that moves my insides. 

L: WTF is that?

M: Come on guys, theres nothing (She starts to run over) he  OOF!

We ended up having to take her to the nurse, who said shes received bruising to the lower abdomen and when she asked how she sustained the injuries, we lied and said she tripped over a wooden bar near the STA block. (STA stands for Science, Technology and Arts).

Later that night, I was on discord in my private circle of friends, and then Marie brought it up. We all discussed it for a bit, until my friend Jordan logged on. He lives in Georgia (The state) and he said hed heard of a rumour that the NZ government were researching invisibility. I replied with the usual XD but he claimed he was being serious, and he provided me with a link to a site that had a lot of evidence for this. Unfortunately, the link was taken down by someone a couple of days after this event. I browsed across the pages and found other reports of rubbery-metallic objects in schools across Auckland. This absolutely freaked me out to the point of me claiming I was sick yesterday. Thankfully, I knew a technique to making myself vomit, triggering the gag reflex at the back of my throat, so I was sick as far as my mum was concerned. (Another thing, my parents are divorced).


Yesterday, I heard a loud crash outside my window. I got out of bed, startled, and looked outside to see a tree in my front yard completely decimated, it was a stump and it looked like a car had run through it. Oddly enough, there was no car and the fence and house was fully intact, so I called my mum and told her what happened, feigning tiredness. When she got back, she was astounded, as anyone would be, that the tree looked like it had been smashed to pieces! I need help, No Sleep. WTF is happening?


P.S.

Im writing this today because when Im sick, devices are banned.
