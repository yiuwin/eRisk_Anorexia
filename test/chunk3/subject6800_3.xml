	<TEXT> Enjoyed the review. Its great when you just cut to the chase for the most part. 

Some have said keeping your videos 3-4 minutes can grow your channel more and wont lose people interest, but others argue that long videos help because YouTube cares about the total "minutes watched" on your channel. The more minutes you have uploaded the better.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do research on all your prospects to what specifically they need help with, and ensure you have a strategy to get on the same page as your prospects. Building friendly rapport quickly is always essential, and showing direct links from campaigns into revenues is always going to be compelling.

	<TEXT> It's nice to see you have multiple rentals bringing in cash flow. 

I would seriously reconsider your cost benefit on the illustration degree. An arts degree for 60k may be worthless without a well paying job in the industry. I second researching into the business degree because it can apply it the arts industry directly, not to mention all other industries and gives you the flexibility to jump industries if opportunities come up. I attained my business degree for less than half of what that arts degree costs and I consider it valuable and worthwhile knowledge </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly not really. Friends and I always ponder the idea of opening up a different bar in Langley that would actually compete with gabbys,  but it seems every bar gets shut down or sucks. I.e.  rock sugar/citrus and Jimmy Liks.

Cactus us alright but IMO the people that go there just spend all there money and tend to be superficial. 

The more I think about it,  real peers are just on Reddit here. We are already like minded and have things in common.  </TEXT>
