	<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit, but here's my quick story:

I went to University of Arizona for a semester last fall (2015). I broke my MacBook so I had to buy a new one from the bookstore. There is a Mac store in it that sells MacBooks, iPads, iPhones, etc. so I go up to the salesperson and ask for the NEW MacBook Pro, I.e. 2015. We ring it up and I put the $1,000 laptop on my school card that my dad paid for. 

Fast forward about a year and I'm having some issues with the laptop so I bring up system preferences and it tells me it is the 2013 model. Confused, I ask my coworker who used to work at apple if this is true. He says yes and to call the bookstore and my credit card company to see if we can get a refund for false advertising or something as the product sold to me was NOT a "brand new MacBook Pro" but in fact a three year old, unopened MacBook. 

So I called the school bookstore and they tell me since I have had the laptop for almost a year, there's really not much they can do. I explain that I know close to nothing about computers and I relied on the salesperson to give me accurate information on what I was buying as I'm clueless. I trusted the salesperson to help and they lied to me and knowingly sold me the wrong product. 

When I called they said they could offer me $700, but I feel that is not fair and I deserve either a full refund or a new MacBook Pro. I'm wondering what I should do? Is there anyway to get my money back or get a new laptop? Do I call apple? What would I even say? 

I would really appreciate any help on this as my laptop is now out of date and not even working anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My family. I couldn't bear to think of how they would handle it. I've suffered severe depression and developed an eating disorder and the only thing that could keep me afloat in my darkest times was the love of my family. I've come very close, but after realizing how selfish it would be, I received the help I needed (and later came to realize, deserved).  </TEXT>
