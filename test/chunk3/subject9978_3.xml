	<TEXT> Upvote for this answer.  I've been full time in information security for the past 10 years.  Cracking MD5 hashed passwords is an easy task.  Separate from the rainbow tables mentioned above (which is essentially a dictionary of common passwords and their MD5 versions: pre-cracked passwords), directly cracking MD5 passwords with a modern gaming video card allows for billions of guesses a second.  Extracting the majority of these one billion passwords would take attackers a matter of hours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some additional details from the medals alone give you a bit of his history (I did similar work when researching my grandfather):

The American Defense Service Medal means he was active duty prior to Pearl Harbor (Dec 7, 1941).  After this date, far more people volunteered.

The American Campaign Medal most likely means he was serving within the US for a year prior to being shipped out (could mean other things as well).  This might include his training time in the US.

The European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign medal means he served in the European theater, but this was already obvious from the fact that he was part of a bomber crew in Europe.  The stars on this tell us more.  There are two versions here, probably from different points in his time in the war.  Each star represents participation in a different campaign.  There were 16 campaigns that could have contributed to these stars.  The document found by canarchist indicates he was in Italy in July 1944, which means one of those stars is for the Rome-Arno campaign.  

cararchist already covered the meaning of the Air Medal and the documentation that probably points to the credit.  

Unfortunately, many of the Army records for service during WWII were destroyed in a fire in the 1970s (including my own grandfathers).  

Edit: the site for this group has a forum where you can ask questions.  Most of the veterans have probably passed by now, but often these sites are filled with children/grandchildren/historians who can answer questions - http://57thbombwing.com/340th_History/489thSquadronHistory.php  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The failure to reach the wifi login page is usually because you tried to visit a page for which your computer has a cached DNS response (it already knows the IP address it wants).  This interferes with the hijacking the wifi login is trying to do.  You can simply visit any site you haven't been to recently.  Just pick a major company site that's quick to type like gm.com or att.com.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Along these lines, when I was younger, there was a house in northern Wisconsin near the main road that was painted bright yellow.  We weren't sure why someone would choose that color and someone informed us that the owners had gotten a lot of cheap surplus paint from the highway department and it was actually road stripe paint.  Sometimes cheap is opportunistic and not systemic.   </TEXT>
