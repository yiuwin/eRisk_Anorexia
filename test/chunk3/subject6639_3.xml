	<TEXT> The man I have been seeing for the last 8 months knows I am bipolar and has seen me during some rough albeit medicated moments. I have reached a point in my life where I understand that I need to consistently take my medication to keep me sane, grounded, and stable, but while he knows I suffer from mental illness, I don't think he will actually believe it until he sees it at its worstor at the very least unmedicated. I'm not quite sure what to do because we have no secrets and he knows about the rough life I have had, but his lack of mental illness knowledge frustrates me and only makes me want to prove to him that I do have it. I'm not even sure what I'm asking here, I just want someone to talk to me.  </TEXT>
