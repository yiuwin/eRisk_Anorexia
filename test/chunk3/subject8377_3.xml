	<TEXT> Well speech pathologists normally work with people with speech impediments like lisps, stuttering and voicelessness as well as speech restoration in those with strokes and helping quadriplegics and stroke victims with swallowing disorders :) We also help people with cleft palate and recent jaw or lip surgery. Vocal coaches are less scientific/medical trained and work mostly with accents, ESL learners, enunciation and actor training. Speech pathologists can do this as well, but our work is typically focussed towards medical conditions (think The Kings Speech) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahaha, no it's not like that really. I'm 5'3 and was the shortest one there, even shorter than the girls. If I was at least an inch or two taller I might have been able to stay. Surprisingly, they encouraged as much body positivity as they could as they worried a lot about self esteem and eating disorders. We had full classes on nutrition and we were cooked full plate meals that we had to eat everything of. The extent of what they did about my height was make sure I didn't have some sort of illness that stunted my growth since my dad is 6'1. But no, it was genetic from my mum's side of the family, they did however found out I had depression and got me help, so ayeeee. The reason they kicked me out goes a little further, ballet in Russia is heavily subsidised by the government because Vaganova should be pushing out star dancers. With my height, I never could fit that criteria. In the end, they recommended me to a bunch of other prestigious schools like SAB in the US. It all worked out for the best, I stayed in touch with my old teacher who was really happy to hear that I became a teacher.  </TEXT>

I guess the most fun fact about me depends on your interests. I went to the most prestigious ballet school when I was kid - Vaganova in Russia. I ended up getting 'kicked out' because I didn't grow very tall, lol (it's super competitive, out of the the thousands who apply, only around 60-80 get in, from that, only 30 graduate from the school).  </TEXT>

While I do agree that maybe it brought up some emasculating memories in the past with bullying and bodily insecurity, I think the bigger problem is this guy has really bad expectations about sex and you just happened to walk right into one of his limits which he should have voiced to you. The guy needs help to overcome his projection, rather than be on the defensive all the time and being accusatory. It's not healthy.

Anyway, I don't think there is anything better you could have done. Sorry it happened to you. :( but at least there are better fucks out there </TEXT>

I was raised to be very courteous and polite, but he is really blunt and upfront with people who step out of line and was always getting into trouble for various things like hacking computers and telling teachers they were wrong. I ended up doing an English project with him, he invited me over to his place and he ordered us pizza and he actually DID the homework to prepare for it which surprised me. We talked and he turned out to be really nice. He ended up standing up for me when a teacher told me off for using rainbow colours in my book (I colour code my notes, still do) because I was one of the few out gay kids, he got detention for that and came out to me that day. A few weeks later he invites me over to finish up the project and then asks me out. Been together for the past 7 years and counting. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you're saying that because other companies do it, it is okay for the president of the United States to do so as well? 

The tax rates of the United States is on par to my own country's, if not less harsh (our tax rates hit up to 45%). Not to mention, there are things called tax breaks to ease the market and allow businesses to flourish. Lowering US taxes won't solve the issue of people not paying taxes, it didn't work in Russia (they lowered it to 13%) and it sure as heck won't work in the US. Because in the end it will still always be cheaper to get mass-produced products in China than the US where the costs and standards of living are higher, as are the wages and materials. 

The US needs to refocus its spending. Rather than waste so much of its GDP on failing wars, it should invest in infrastructure and innovation. Not bringing back decade old trades that will all be consumed by automation in another 5-10 years. These are very expensive short term solutions. Take it from someone who has lived almost 6 years under an incompetent government whose answer to increasing jobs and growth was cutting jobs in health, teaching etc, and advertising work to people with visas. Because it's cheap. Not because it's sustainable. And that's been Trump and the Republican's line for ages.  </TEXT>

I don't agree that gay people should not vote Trump. But there are better reasons than what you listed like loss of jobs and retraining from conversion to renewable energy or because you disagree with gun control or anti discrimination laws which limit freedom of speech. And that these issues are more important than lgbt rights. 

I could never vote for Trump because I value things he doesn't support moreso than the things he does. That doesn't make me a leftist, that means I have priorities that won't be swayed by the candidates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone. I recently graduated from a Master of Nursing and am now an RN in Sydney! Yay! I'm really keen on working in perioperative nursing, especially in anaesthetics and instrument circulation, and hope to become a nurse practitioner some day, but I am a little confused as to how exactly you get into these sectors? I know you need to get into a transitional program, but exactly how common are they and how are you selected?

I have an undergraduate degree in psychology and graduated with Distinction in both my bachelors and my masters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the moment, there is a huge push to train nurses to take over jobs that doctors can do such as practitioner and anaesthetics because they are cheaper to train and pay. I also live in a country with a public health system, so unless you want to be a surgeon, there is diminishing job security  </TEXT>

I stopped going when I was 16. Didn't feel I needed the nostalgia anymore and my dad understood. He still goes occasionally, because as a pilot, it at least gives him routine  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's about a 6 minute train ride from Central station. Platform 19. There are also buses which run into Newtown as well such as the 423. They take 13 minutes. A little longer now since the roads they take are now single lane due to installation of a tram system. Train is more reliable. But you will need to get an Opal card. You top up money to this card or link it to your credit card and it will charge you for train, bus and ferry trips by you tapping on and off stops. 

It's also where all the cool food like cronuts and $12 ice tea is. And nice boutiques and book stores. It's great for a shop during the day and a dine and pub crawl at night.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The focal point of the scene is typically Surry Hills and Darlinghurst with Oxford St. However, you'll found that most of the eastern suburbs such as Randwick, Coogee and Newtown do also have a vibrant culture of sexual diversity. 

I'm not involved much with the scene, but I do live and work in Newtown and the gay scene there seems to be a bit more artsy - full of your twinky types, hipsters and even goths. I'd say the biggest thing to be concerned about in Sydney is cost, it's insanely expensive here and I'd say it's really not all that dangerous unless you want to start prowling around Kings Cross late at night. There is not anything specific to look out for, except to use the half flush on your toilet when you pee. We're in a drought dammit! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am the sex worker lol. I used to be an escort to fund mine and my partner's way through university, rent and whatever expenses life threw at us. I also ended up using the funds to get better work by opening up my own ballet school. Everyone has their own reasons and their own story for why they do it. Sex work is a job just like any other, there are rules you need to follow, in my state you need to see a doctor monthly and cease all work if you contract an STI, and the service you sell is an act. It's all pretend. To survive in the industry, you have to become a new person, then when you clock out you revert back to your normal self. </TEXT>

No actually we're really a couple. 

But he does act gay. He sucks dick good and eats ass like a pro.  </TEXT>

Besides, when someone is ON MEDICATION, they are treating the issue. Would you rather fuck someone who wasn't treating the issue and had those things? Because you may not realise but you'd be safer dating someone treating their condition, than someone whose medicine cabinet is empty. They could be forgoing the help they need. At least that guy won't 'be crazy' because that's what the medicines prevent.  </TEXT>

It's a weird city, it's both progressive and corporatised and renting here costs a kidney, buying a place costs your soul. But I doubt I could ever leave. It's such an oxymoronic place where you both have amazing chill out zones with the beaches and the farmers markets and casual eateries, but then you have the really fast paced inner city, with rich cultural and ethnic diversity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While this is true, the article does not show exactly how much progestin is needed to produce these effects. Going from my biology study, synthetic progesterone in oral contraceptives is much higher than in naturally occurring progesterone. There aren't a great deal of human studies on the role of progesterone and sex, at least not what I can find, but it is common for women to report increased sexual responsiveness during these times so I guess we can still only speculate on whether the findings of the original article are conferring something which could be naturally occurring, but using a manipulation of contraceptives which can be more controlled.  </TEXT>
