	<TEXT> Recommended/required calorific, nutritional intake etc, is dependant on several factors, meaning there would be no single perfect foodstuff for all people and situations. Environmental considerations are one factor. An earlier thread discussed the greater calorific intake for surviving in cooler climes, in order to maintain body temperature. Another example would be people living a very active life style; hunters/gathers vs folks with a more sedentary life style - office workers, say. More activity requires greater calorie intake. 

So short answer is no, a single perfect food stuff would not be possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure it'll fit the bill, but I've always found Harry Harrison's Steel Rat series to be a sort of space MacGyver; good at improvisation with few resources. 

A good precursor to these is Wasp by Eric Frank Russell; in a similar vein, but less comedic than the Steel Rat books. 

Any of the Powell and Donovan robot stories by Asimov; these all feature creative thinking\solutions, not always technical though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Mission Impossible 2, the scene at the end with Ethan Hunt\Tom Cruise being thrown onto his back and then having the knife stop millimetres from his eyeball - all done for real. The knife had a steel cable, or somesuch, firmly anchored into I-don't-know-what, and Tom Cruise insisted they do the scene for real. So his opponent leapt onto him, swinging the knife towards his eye, and had it stopped by the cable alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boss is completely blind (hereditary), and my job is focused on making websites more usable by disabled, primarily blind users. Computers can be very usable without sight using screenreading software - both macs and pcs. 

Touch typing is the best computer related skill he could learn right now. Check with the American Federation for the Blind for more info I would guess. i'm uk based and will happily pm you more info when back at my desk (on the road at the moment)

I know there is a growing trend for remote usability or accessibility testing, which is possibly some source of income for your brother - perhaps something to look into. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My first ever boss was a friend's dad; it was a v. small, family run business. 

I'd worked there for a few years, and was around 20. I took a phone call from my scumbag bank one day, with them explaining how they were charging me x for authorising a payment to my credit card (also with them), which took me over my overdraft limit; thus the charge. Irate, I argued with them (and was none-too polite - I know the call centre staff don't really have anything directly to do with my account,but I was wound up). I was quite in debt with my bank, and thanks to constant charges like this, despite regular payments, my debt was not decreasing. At all.

Getting off the phone, my boss had obviously overheard my call, or at least realised I was in financial dire straits. Wrote me a cheque to clear my debts there and then, with regular payments (interest free) deducted from my wages. Debt free in a year, and always thankful for that kindness.

Second boss: was working on a factory floor, assembling car seats. Pay was pretty good, but work was ball-breakingly hard. I was contracted through an agency for this work, and every week would need to get my boss to sign my time sheet (As would most of the others on my team); and every week, nearly without fail, our boss would sign our timesheets, after putting us down for 6 hours extra on Sunday (which I rarely worked), or some other made up hours. Sunday was double pay too, which means I frequently got an extra 12 hours pay a week. Freakin awesome boss. Company was mad loaded, so didn't feel any guilt at this. </TEXT>

It certainly is a 50th Anniversary copy of The Hobbit :-) My 3rd copy of the Hobbit, and my favourite. Well spotted! I didn't even realise it was illustrated until getting it down just now to check it; I've had it a couple of years, but haven't felt the need to re-read the Hobbit in that time, so it's sat unopened on my shelf. Might need to re-read it now.

I've love to get an old set of the LOTR books too at some point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Get some spring water to have on the side; cleansing the palette and just keeping hydrated are both good. Oatcakes also good for something fairly neutral to munch on, and will help set the scene, being pretty Scottish. 

I also showed this [Highland Park whisky tasting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boj33DVSILQ) video at my last tasting; it's entertaining enough, and informative :-)

(Trivia - I was in that tasting room last week after a distillery tour :-) )

I also browsed for some reviews of the whiskies I was having at my tasting, along with a bit of background on the distillery itself - nice to have a bit of trivia or some odd facts about them. Just adds to the experience imho. 

Can't really comment too much on your selection; I'm only familiar with the Uigedail and HP12, but the order looks good.
