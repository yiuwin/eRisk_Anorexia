	<TEXT> This is so stupid. I get one thing wrong because I can't go back and edit the title or at least I don't know how. It's a photo from her Facebook so not the real thing. I knew she was the highest rank of enlisted in the army so I thought E-10 like it is in the Coast Guard motherfucker (Master Chief Petty Officer of The Coast Guard, or at least they are technically an E-10) whatever. There is a real photo but she has it. I'm not in the fucking Army so I don't have the ranking right. Sue me. That's my aunt who looks just like me bitch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanna take a machine gun to all male lawmakers that are passing these debilitating laws for women. I'm legitimately getting scared for us women. Every Other day I read an article on another right we are losing or another way our lives are getting harder. And this is a 1st world country. I'm seriously ready to bail before I wake up and it's the 1800s all over  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well normally i would tell you to tell them to "Fuck off" but that doesn't seem to be in your character. What you could do is create or buy a shirt that says Pleas Fuck off and men actually will leave you alone. Also you could work on your bitchface. Although men can be understanding if you ask them to stop, but if they're the type to do these things asking them won't do much. You really do have to learn to be assertive aka a 'bitch' if you want men to leave you alone. Take it from me. I'm tiny at 4'11 and 100lbs and curvy with a pretty face and very vulnerable LOOKING but not if you mess with me. I am introverted but I learned if you want men not to verbally harass you, you need to aggressively let them know. I put on my best bitchface and straight up give them the evil eye if they catcall me and it never happens again from the same person. Or I flip them off. Your anxiety probably tells you something bad might happen if you say something or give the evil eye but most men won't do shit. Since it's college tards they'll probably back off. Also make sure you're in a public area if you are going to tell them to back off. I hope this helps. I'm tiny and guys actually tell me I scare them at first so they don't fuck with me. A mean face can solve a lot of those problems!  Hope this helps!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly it makes the most sense if it's your neighbor. Especially if he can access your attic through his. Too easy. And if it stops than I'd say that's almost proof it's him </TEXT>
