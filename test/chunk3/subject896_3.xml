	<TEXT> Went bowling with some friends one night and was next to a very loud and obnoxious party. Actually, it was one lady in particular that really annoyed us. She was in her mid 30s, extremely overweight with a volume and opinion to match. Later that night it was her turn to bowl. As she released the ball, her sausage fingers became wedged in the finger holes and she went flying down the lane. I've never seen a 300+ person take a fall like that. She actually slid a good 6 feet or so down the lane. She got up (without ease) and ran into the bathroom. We couldn't stop chuckling. Eventually an employee came to "wash off" the lane. It was like they came to wipe off all the grease she'd left from her fall.

TLDR; Fat annoying lady got her fingers stuck in a bowling ball and bowled herself down the lane. Bowling employee literally wiped off the fat she left. </TEXT>

I had some change in my car and waved down the meter maid to put in the meter. A group of loiterers cheered me on as I drove away. I don't need a 'pay it forward' moment. Just loads of applause.  </TEXT>
