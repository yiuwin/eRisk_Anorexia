	<TEXT> Because boats have a lot more motivation that rocks. Boats are cleaned regularly, they are loved by their owners, they are advertised on tv, and they are really cool looking. The titanic sank because he got advertised so much that the fame went to his head and he became depressed. Rocks are neglected by everyone. They are kicked around and thrown like they are no ones. However, the rocks that have faces painted on them have more motivation, and thus could maybe float! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately, the moon you saw is not coming back. However, since space is really cold, the sun will burn out and turn into the new moon. Seeing the moon overshadowing Suns, a sun from another galaxy will come and murder the moon to start the cycle again. Eventually we will run out of Suns and everyone will die. But that won't happen for at least two years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now-a-days most people go to hyperspace for fast passes. However if you're going to do this I recommend getting them and going on the ride because if you get there first the line is never more than 30 minutes. Also if you don't mind getting a bit wet go to splash. The line is really short in the morning and in the summer it might be the only time to do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hold a grudge against the Disneyland hotels because every single time we have bought the premium view. And every single time we didn't get it. The access to the parks is nice. Plus you get a free magic morning. However, the rooms are average and the price is outrageous. I recommend staying at the Marriott next to the convention center.  It's a short shuttle ride to the parks and the hotel rooms are just as nice. Also you get a free magic morning anyways if you get a hopper pass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really don't want to get political about this, but certain rides cannot be completely re-themed. There is a reason why Pirates, Haunted Mansion, and Matterhorn remain virtually unchanged. Its because they are classics. While Walt himselft didn't help with Tower of Terror, it still has the amazing emersiveness that something like the classics have. If they change it just to capitalize on the rise of a "meh" Marvel movie then I will be angry </TEXT>

	<TEXT> okay okay... Disney can do what they want.. but if they ditch the amazing Twilight Zone theme (All of the ride's emersive beautifuly perfected scenery and story elements) for something like Guardians of the Galaxy, I will seriously not want to go to the parks anymore. That is my favorite ride and that is mostly due to how much detail is put into it. No Disney... just no. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With Mad T Party ending, I feel like Hollywood Pictures Backlot needs something new. Right now the only ride that anyone goes there for it Tower of Terror. However, being a very popular ride, it, a lot of the time, has a very long line. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for attractions in the area. A new rollercoaster? Some other dark ride?  </TEXT>
