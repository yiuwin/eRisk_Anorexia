	<TITLE> Who are your muses? And how do they impact your music? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Famous artists often have famous muses. Picasso had Dora Maar. Chopin had George Sand. John Lennon - Yoko Ono. David Bowie - Iman. Here's a good list of others: http://theredlist.com/wiki-2-24-224-268-view-culture-art-fashion.html

As a songwriter, I've had a bunch of muses over the years. Sometimes it's been another band. Or a girl I never even spoke with. Early in my marriage, it was my wife. Now I have three young children and I find myself writing all of my songs for them. The music changes drastically with the muse - from alienation, desire, unrequited love to security, safety, adoration. And now, with little kids, a lot of chaos and silliness.

Look no farther than John Lennon to see the way a muse can dramatically change a musician's art.

I'd enjoy hearing about other music makers' muses and how they have shaped the music. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Super helpful. Better planning definitely sounds like sage advice, and I'm going to try out the idea of merging frames together to see how that looks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I learned about this guy years ago at a Ripley's Believe it or Not museum in Copenhagen. Turned out that I didn't believe it, because for years I thoght it was sensationalized and mostly fiction. I recently looked him up after making a bet with my physician friend, and it turns out everything in the museum (all the appliances, including a refrigerator, bikes, TVs, the airplane) was an accurate reproduction of what Mr. Lotito ate in his lifetime. According to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Lotito </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I often cite Event Horizon as the scariest film I've ever seen. It seemed to fly below the radar, but I swear I've never been nearly as disturbed by a film. Couldn't sleep for a couple nights. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not a bad idea. Now I'm spinning about who would be cast as Madam Mim. I could see them going with Helena Bonham Carter, but I'm trying to place someone a bit more ghastly. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> About to purchase my first Moog synth </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-11 20:09:22 </DATE>

	<TEXT> After a decade + of drooling over Moog synths (usually MiniMoog Ds or Voyagers) and wanting to get into legit analog synthesis, I've decided to jump. The Sub 37 seems to have the right price point and feature set for someone newer to analog synthesis. I played around with one a few weeks ago in a music shop and fell in love.

There are loads of videos on Youtube showing off what it can do, but I'm looking to start at the beginning of analog synthesis and learn how to tweak and build from the ground up. So far this professor at Middle Tennessee State has the most helpful videos I've found on the topic:

If anyone has other recommendations of good instructional videos that go slowly and in depth, I would appreciate the recommendations. And any thoughts on the Moog Sub 37 are welcome. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> This occurred to me: It's selfish to use the bigger roll of toilet paper </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Stick with me for a moment on this one.

Commercial restrooms often have multiple rolls of toilet paper, with varying amounts of tissue remaining on each. My own instincts, and some informal polling of friends, lead me to believe that most users will naturally reach for the largest roll. It's easier to grab, takes less rotations and is less curved. But there are consequences. 

Evening janitorial staff will routinely dispose of any rolls that are even half depleted and replace them with full rolls. So if you have two rolls that are each half depleted, you result in a full roll worth of waste when the staff replaces each roll. Whereas if everyone would use one of the rolls until fully depleted, at the end of the day there might be no needless waste when that single empty roll is replaced.

Want to save trees? Eliminate excess waste and cost? Then use the smaller roll of TP. </TEXT>
