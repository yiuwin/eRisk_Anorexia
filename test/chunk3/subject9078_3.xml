	<TEXT> The source you gave says only 51 out of nearly 200 governments are authoritarian. Yes, there is a spectrum between democracy and dictatorship, but a democracy with some anti-democratic elements does not a dictatorship make.

It's also worth putting that index in a historical context. In 1900, no country had universal suffrage. All of them would have scored horribly. Once again, this shows a bad trend for authoritarianism.

If they had hypothetically chosen a dictatorship then that would have been done as a result of a democratic action

How? The founders were a small club of ultra-rich landowners. They were *unelected* and they never held referendums. Them coming together and deciding to make a dictatorship doesn't fit any definition of democracy whatsoever.

The point is that the longevity of a governmental type is just one indicator of it's effectiveness among many.

That's fair. I originally said longevity was a neutral indicator, not the only indicator. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, dictatorships are doing quite well nowadays, as they always have been.

I meant that democracies outnumber dictatorships today. A quick Google search shows that there are a total of 123 democracies and only 49 dictatorships. Considering how few democracies there were just a few decades ago, this is a bad trend for dictatorships. Also, the combined GDP of democracies is much greater. Things could change, but that's how it stands right now.

If a country can choose it's form of government, then that simply means it by definition is a democracy.

That's... not true? The US Founding Fathers could have chosen to make the government a dictatorship, and the public could have accepted it by not rebelling. That would not make the US a democracy.

That's because democracy is a better form of government. It's not a better form of government because it lasts longer.

This is 100% contradictory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's from a 2012 [Pew report](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/). The number seems high because a lot of people claim a religion without tightly adhering to its rules. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can identify as a Christian without rigidly following Christian values. It's not really up to you to decide that makes this person a non-Christian. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you mean by science being mainstream?

You answered this yourself with the stats of your university. People are much more likely to study science than philosophy. Even if you don't go on to college, you will have completed many science courses in high school and probably not a single philosophy course.

Of course it is much less, because there is a myriad of scientific fields and plenty of students in each.

Which is exactly the point. Somehow our society came to value science much more than philosophy. Part of that is because science is more economically valuable, but that doesn't explain why religion still has so much power. Worldwide, a lot of religious institutions get generous government funding, even though it has terrible ROI, and academic disciplines like philosophy would kill for that kind of cash. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess it's sort of interesting that religion has survived with the rise of science. Science explains the universe and gives hard proof, so in many ways it fills the role that religion played for most of human history. And yet, I don't think religion will disappear anytime soon. Probably because, as you said, it's hard-wired. </TEXT>
