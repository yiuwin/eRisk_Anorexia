But they're the kind of people who will immediately shoot down the idea.

What else can we do? It's winter, freezing cold outside usually. We're all guys in this case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hated the xJawz part, just because the topics weren't interesting at all :s

The normal part in the middle was great!

I dislike the Ryan segment. I didn't like him from the start when he mentioned a hypothetical where if an old lady were to get hit by a car, he'd laugh. I noticed he was a dick from the start. Also, how often does someone need to curse? Jesus.

I disliked it because I still feel really sorry for him. I get that he deserves it, but I'm such an empathetic guy in real life, that I always feel sorry for the "bad" guys when they get what's coming to them. The hosts seem like villains for egging him on and hyping the show up to make sure a lot of people see it.

But whatever, can't wait till PKA 162 and so on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny you mention this. I just played that best team in Domination with all bronze players. Down by 3 with 10 seconds left. I inbound to a wide open guy who's 10ft away from me, the pass goes out of bounds. I still sent it to overtime though and got the win, somehow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just had 3 possessions in a row, I repeat, in a row, messed up because a wide open Lebron James tried to pass the ball to a wide open Dwyane Wade, but instead the ball passed next to Wade and went out of bounds.

A worse feeling is when you inbound the ball with no opponent in sight, and the ball just goes out of bounds.

This is really frustrating, especially seeing how it's Lebron, a guy with an 85+ pass rating. The pass rating doesn't even matter, a guy with a 25 rating could make these passes.

This shouldn't happen as often as it does. It happens to me at least twice a game. I'm not a bad player by any means.

EDIT: An even WORSE thing is when you direct a flashy pass to, let's say, the player to the right, and it passes to the player in the opposite direction, which results in a turnover. Lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this guy found a way you can reset stars in Domination mode. You can only do it one team at a time though. I haven't tried yet. I will in an hour and I'll report back with an edit,

If it does work, I think it's useful! I'm guessing they'll patch it, use this method while you can.

Source: http://www.operationsports.com/forums/nba-2k-my-team-next-gen/695193-reset-your-myteam-domination-mode.html

EDIT: It works. All you do is, as soon as your start up the game and get past the loading screen, just pause and quit. Remember this will consume contracts. I did this with the Knicks because I didn't get the 3 star pack for some reason, got cheated out of it. </TEXT>
