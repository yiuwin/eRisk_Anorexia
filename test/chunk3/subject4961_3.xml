	<TITLE> Too scared to go into LD </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not experience at all at this stuff, I just tried a method, and I started to feel lucidity, but then there's a trailer for a horror movie which is the dream that I'm about to have, and then It's like I get an option to exit now, or have to endure a nightmare. So I'm really scared to have a lucid dream now because of paralysis and scary stuff.

Any help would be appreciated, and also I'm not really sure of the best way to lucid dream. I downloaded an app called Awoken which I'm going to use tonight to try and have a lucid dream. Any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Advice </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-12 11:35:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a programmer looking for a bit of advice, just in general.(and somewhere to let out my thoughts and my situation) I have done quite a lot in C# and Unity, and messed around with pretty much every language, and know a little bit of each. This year I want to focus on one main language, I chose python for that, as that's what I will be doing for school anyway, I am doing it on code academy, as it's one of the best course's I have found. So getting to the point, I don't know if I should continue to mess around with lots of languages, and not know them well, but then I get jealous of the people who spent a long time doing one thing and they end up being really really good, whilst I'm still "messing around" Or I could focus on one language and get really good,  that's probably the main decision, and on top of that, I am easily swayed(especially in programming), I will sit down and say right, I'm learning C# fully, and I won't stop, but then I'll look up something like "How to make a game"(cringey, I know), and it'll say something like "C# is the wrong language for that", and I'll give up C# for the next thing, and then the cycle repeats, over and over again, so I'm not actually confident in any language(apart from basics, and a bit more). I guess the thing I find most difficult is sticking with one language for a long time. I would really appreciate it if some people in the profession, gave me some pointers, such as what language I should focus on, and where I can learn it. Thanks for reading. </TEXT>
