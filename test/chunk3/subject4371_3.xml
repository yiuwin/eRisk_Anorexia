	<TEXT> I had considered this, but there is a chance you could whiff. I was really only interested in cards that find you Rhinos with certainty, like Bring to Light and Dark Petition. Unfortunately, there aren't more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did consider this, but I thought it wouldn't be in the spirit of the deck to include any non-Siege Rhino creatures. Clever Impersonator and Mercurial Pretender (not standard legal) are essentially Siege Rhinos.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * 4x [[Siege Rhino]]  - This is essential to the deck, the linchpin
* 4x [[Dark Petition]]       - search for Rhinos
* 4x [[Bring to Light]]     - search for Rhinos 
* 4x [[Clever Impersonator]]   - copies Rhinos, including ETB effect
* 4x [[Mirror Mockery]]      - copies Rhinos, including ETB effect
* 4x [[Supplant Form]]    - copies Rhinos, including ETB effect
* 4x [[Mercurial Pretender]]   - copies Rhinos, including ETB effect
* 4x [[Exert Influence]]    - steal other people's Rhinos
* 4x [[Mortuary Mire]]     - get back dead Rhinos
* 1x [[Map the Wastes]]    - ramp 
* 23x Lands    - to cast Rhinos or Rhino related spells

* Sideboard = 4x [[Clone Legion]] - if you find that your opponent has no Rhino's in his deck (which is rare), you can swap this in for [[Exert Influence]]

	<TEXT> This is actually my favorite MTG podcast, and this is saying a lot considering how much I enjoy listening to Chapin and Top Level Podcast - not to mention that I have never played a single match of Vintage. It's just great how thoroughly they dissect cards, tactics, the metagame, etc. The level of depth is astounding - the fact they practically devoted an entire episode to the card [[Gitaxian Probe]] speaks to this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was saying this in response to someone who truly hated seeing multiple siege rhinos. It was a semi-joking response. A semi because as a sideboard option, it's not crazy. Even in the main deck though - you don't think you'd be able to guess what creatures are important just based on the land they play? </TEXT>
