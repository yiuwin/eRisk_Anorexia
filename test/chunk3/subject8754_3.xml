	<TEXT> I've been vaping for 4+ years and this little thing is amazing. I'm not trying to boast by any means but I probably have close to $500 in mods tanks etc and this $40 cig-a-like is far better. I had seen the Juul advertised about a year or so ago and I thought to myself "it will never give me what I'm looking for." But when I went to my local B M store recently and watched a employee using one I said "well she has all this equipment to choose from and she is using that" I had also been looking for something more convenient while at work (I work outside 10.5hrs a day on major highways) The final event in this change of thought process is when I witnessed a co worker using one. Then I told myself "what do I have to lose?" This is by far my most important move related to vaping. I really hope people will realize how amazing this thing is.  </TEXT>
