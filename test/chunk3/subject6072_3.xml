	<TEXT> How much do O'Leary's actual political positions matter?

Seems like extremely little to me.  He has been very vague on everything, and no one has released less detail and policy proposal than him.  Even what positions he has made clear, I don't see anything that really sticks out (oh you're anti-carbon tax?  Get in line, all the candidates are except Chong).  Half the things he says aren't even serious (carbon jail anyone?).

It seems like he's going to win solely on the fact he's Kevin O'Leary with absolutely zero respect to policy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the thing, from my opinion at least.

It isn't the governments job to try and influence which career paths people of certain genders take.  The government should enforce discrimination laws with conviction, absolutely.  The government should ensure that legally, men and women have all the same opportunities in the workplace.  But it is not the governments job to decide there isn't as many women in engineering as they prefer so they're going to force universities to take more, push women to be engineers, and make companies hire them.  Women have full ability and opportunity to be engineers, if they are simply choosing not to do that, then its not up to the government to decide if they like it or not.

Cultural and genetic factors influence what jobs the genders take.  So even if culture is influencing less women to be engineers, **that is not the governments job to try and change that**.  Not a whole lot of men become nurses, should the government try and change that too?  No, they shouldn't, or this will go on forever.

Edit: Grammar </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can estimate.  Thats what they're doing.  These are guesses.  Very detailed and heavily analyzed guesses, but still guesses.

But if you valuate Tesla according to current revenue, their stock price would go up by 60% a year at this rate.  Banks and financial institutions estimate how fast and how high their revenue will rise though, because they know it will.  Thats how you account for potential.

Investing is really entirely different from gambling.  Investing is highly educated analysis, gambling is luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But that does not mean they are overvalued.  Every single stock out there accounts for potential, big or small.  Indeed, some of the tech companies will fail.  Many others will justify their potential, even overshoot them.

What you're saying is basically all tech companies are overvalued.  No, they're not.  Compare Exxon Mobil's and Google's revenues to their market cap and you'll find Google has more market cap to less revenue.  Does that mean all oil companies are undervalued and all tech companies are overvalued?  No, not in the slightest.  Google's market cap accounts for more potential.  Tesla's valuation accounts for largely potential.  That may mean they are overvalued if growth stopped today, but it does not mean they are overvalued as a company.

SnapChat is worth 26 Billion almost entirely on potential.  If you believe they are overvalued, thats fine, but that is an opinion, its not even close to a fact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trudeau's plan doesn't neccesarily do that.  

He just gives the money back to the provinces, its up to them to decide if/how to redistribute the money.  So if you live in a province that doesn't distribute it, blame your provincial government.

Its a tough one.  Trudeau's plan is less efficient and only neccesarily revenue-neutral at the federal level, but it gives the provinces more autonomy.  Chong's is fully revenue-neutral and more efficient (because its nationalized), but it comes at the expense of provincial autonomy.  Can't really say either or is inherently "better", just different objectives. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm just hoping to put together a quick summary of each candidates position on climate change.  Also, it should be noted all candidates are opposed to a carbon tax with the exception of Michael Chong.

If a candidate is **not** listed below, that means I was not able to find any concrete position on climate change action.  I will update as I find more info.

**Chong**: Revenue-neutral carbon tax increasing to $130 a tonne by 2030.  Cut regulation, green subsidies.

[Read More](https://www.chong.ca/environmental_opportunity)

**Trost**: Climate change is not real.  No action.

**Bernier**: Sell natural gas to China (I could not find any concrete plan or details beyond that on implementation).  Previously expressed skepticism on climate change.

**Obhrai**: Recycle nuclear waste, other "alternative" solutions (only thing specified, no details on how).

**O'Leary**: Sell carbon capture technology from agents in embassy (no details beyond that, or details on what he means).  Also suggested a carbon jail, but statements have been conflicting.  No official position.  Says it is not a top priority.

**Saxton**: Create economic environment that will "incentivize more innovation" (no details on how).  Any taxation or regulation must be in line with the US.  

[Read More](http://andrewsaxton.ca/canadian-dream/environment/)

**O'Toole**: Fund research into non-emmitting technology.  Tax incentives for investments in carbon-reducing technology and carbon reductions.

[Read More](http://erinotoole.ca/environment/)

**Alexander**: Tax incentives for investments in carbon-reducing technology.  Tax credits for zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) development.  $10K rebate for purchases of ZEV.

[Read More](http://chrisalexander.ca/policy/reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-promoting-economic-growth)

**Leitch**: Provinces are doing enough.  No action.

[Read More](https://kellieworks.ca/no-national-carbon-tax/)

**Scheer**: "Sector by sector" regulation approach.  No further details or specifics provided.

	<TEXT> I woud like to say to just ignore it, but this is unacceptable and people do need to see it.

Getting partisans wound up is one thing - many politicians do that.  I don't like it at all, but like you said its whatever and lots of low-class politicians from all sides engage in that.

But he suggested something that would be both incredibly unfair, impossible, and illegal.  Imagine if transfer payments became a tool to be used at will for the federal government to bully provinces into doing what they please.  That would be disastrous.

For O'Leary to suggest that is beyond ridiculous.  He *needs* to be called out for this crap, all politicians do.  He doesn't get a free pass for this.  Things like these are when the media of all sides need to hold politicians accountable for what they say.  This isn't reality TV anymore.

Us ignoring is will only lead to less people seeing it.  And lets be honest, many average Canadians that see the remarks will not understand their significance.  The leading candidate for leadership of the Conservative Party just suggested this.  He should deal with the full gravity of what he just suggested.  We could all agree to ignore him if he was some fringe wing-nut yelling from the sidelines, or if he were still a reality TV personality vying for better ratings.  But he's not, *he is very possibly the next Leader of the Opposition* and he needs to be treated as such.

[Canadian Government Grants](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/grants.html): Two sections solely for Aboriginals.  

[Canadian Government Funding For First Nations](  https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100033679/1100100033680): from Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs.  This is where most of the funding comes from, as long as you're a "Status Indian", which my room-mate is (she pays 0 tuition).

These are just federal programs.  Provinces sometimes offer additional stuff too.  This stuff applies to everything though, go look up business grants and you'll find tons of Aboriginal-only grants there too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, I probably lean left but I agree.  Quebec should not recieve different treatment than the rest of Canada.

This may be controversial, but I see the same things with Aboriginals.  I was sitting with a friend from a poorer family recently as he was looking at college grants (he was really struggling to come up with tuition and trying to avoid taking out tons of debt).

There was TONS of grants and funding available only for Aboriginals.  My room-mate is First Nation (from an upper-middle class family), her schooling is paid for.  But my low-income friend trying to pay for school gets no where near the support.

I get there is good intentions behind this stuff, but why is a poor Aboriginal person more worthy of help than a poor white person?  My friend had a terrible childhood, he has no money, but it seems he was born the wrong ethniticity to get government assistance.  If I question why, I seem to get called racist.  It just seems like double-standards to me. </TEXT>

By the [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm), natural gas is cheaper.  However, wind is only very marginally behind natural gas is the good news.

By [Lazards](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-analysis-100/), wind and solar are actually slightly cheaper.

It definetly is cheaper, but solar is dropping in price a lot faster than wind so it should overtake it soon.  Solar does have some advantages too, it's more predictable and way easier to reliably integrate energy storage with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To my my knowledge none exists.  But Gini is generally accurate in that respect; the US is high (a right-wing country), Canada is in the middle (a centrist country), and Scandanavian countries are at the bottom (left wing countries).

I think most people would say because of how crazy right wing the Republican Party is, you need a counter-weight.

I can only speak for my own country here, but if you asked me if Canada needs more American influence, my answer would be no way.  For example, Canadian support in universal healthcare is 90 to 95%.  The short of it is, Canadians overwhelmingly prefer what they have now.  To suggest moving to an American system would be nothing short of political suicide.  So I guess my answer to why we don't need American influence would be no one wants it.

America on the other hand, came strikingly close to electing a left-wing socialist out of nowhere.  About [58% of Americans](http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx) do want federally funded universal healthcare.  I think its clear a large portion of Americans do want a more moderate alternative. </TEXT>
