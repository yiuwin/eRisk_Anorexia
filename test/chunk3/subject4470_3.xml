	<TEXT> Yeah, you're absolutely right. 
*Adaptation* probably would've  been the correct word, I guess. And I have heard that it was a good read quite a few times. It really is some intriguing subject matter. One these days, Ill definitely read it. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Been wanting to watch this one for a bit now. Been a big fan a Soderbergh's version for a while now. Didn't even know it was a remake up until like a year ago.

I have to be up for a while, so now I have something to help me pass the time. Thanks for the upload! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow. Movie guide you're damn fast! Lol, sorry, I never actually post anything here, let alone anywhere on reddit and am impressed with movie guide's quickness.

Anyways, since this has become one of my favorite subs thought I'd drop a movie off that I had been wanting to watch for a really long time, saw it rec'd to me by youtube today and was like, "sweet!" 


I dug it. I've been into punk music for a long time and to see a lot of these guys who I grew up listening to shown in a different light (as fucking Dad's!)was pretty fucking cool. There's a lot of good backstories thrown in the movie too. 


So, if you're into that kinda shit, I'd definitely recommend it


E: Oh, and just cuz I don't think movie guide actually describes the bands (well more like whoever the *dad* is in the band, anyways) in the movie very well. Jim and Pennywise are probably the biggest part of the movie. There's also Nofx, The Casualties, Bad Religion, US Bombs, The Vandals, The Adolescents, Everclear, Rancid and others.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had a Philipina ex and her family would use hot dogs in all sorts of stuff; like pansit, mac and cheese, and on new years eve it was traditional to make a shit ton of hot dog spaghetti. Nothing wrong with hot dogs. Esp Nathans. To this day i still accredit her with opening my palate up to all sorts of new weird food. Im Mexican and before her i thought even sushi was weird.These days I love all sorts foods many (especially in my family) would think of as "weird".
