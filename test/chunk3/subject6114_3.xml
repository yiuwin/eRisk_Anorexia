	<TEXT> Sure, there's a bit of an assumption going on, but I don't think it is an egregious assumption. He's clearly dismissed underhanded free throws in the past and we have many big men on record stating that they wouldn't do it because it's embarrassing. Since Drummond hasn't said much about it other than his refusal to shoot that way, people are assuming it is for the most obvious reason; the reason Wilt and Shaq didn't want to do it. 

"I felt silly, like a sissy, shooting underhanded," Chamberlain wrote in his autobiography. "I know I was wrong. I just couldn't do it." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you show me the source that says they tried it and didn't notice an improvement? 

The narrative comes from dozens of articles stating his hesitancy to shoot underhand.

Like this one: http://www.courant.com/sports/uconn-mens-basketball/hc-calhoun-charity-game-feature-0814-20160813-story.html

Drummond continues to work on free throws, along with his footwork, though he dismisses any suggestion he should try shooting them underhand. "I'm just really just continuing to work on back-to-the-basket stuff," he said, "and working on getting better from the foul line. I'm going to stick with the formula I have now." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is what a few people are referencing:

"I think Golden State and some other teams play very well, but look at the game of basketball. They run one play. Well, maybe two plays. They've got a high-pick with the center, then the shooters run baseline trying to get open with blocks from the forwards. I mean that's it. You don't see hardly any reverse plays at all, no double screens, no weak side and whatnot."

There's been a number of articles on his hesitancy to shoot underhand. There's also been articles stating that everything is on the table, but he clearly still seems hesitant to shoot underhand. As a fan, r/snoaH_ could be right that they tried it and it didn't work, but it doesn't mean that he hasn't been hesitant to try it.  </TEXT>

 "I watched the movie Concussion" AMA

Which is an asshole comment. It's not like I was trying to oversell what I know, or act like I was an authority on the issue, but I did spend half a year of my life researching a paper and working on my presentation on head injuries in sports last year, so I alluded to that.

then you right after: 

CT scan shows a mild concussion but cant show concussions. How does that work? I am not a doctor or a CT guy

The sarcasm is oozing out of your statement, because I'm a doctor or a CT guy... C'mon, get some self awareness. I made it clear that I wasn't an authority on the issue, so it's pretty clear where your comment is coming from by saying that. I take offense to people being dicks to people who were never mean or malicious to them or anyone else. I just think its an asshole move and far too many people feel like it's necessary to put people in there place, so yeah, I'll be an asshole to anyone who goes after me in someway unprovoked, every time.  </TEXT>

I am not an expert on concussions; however, I did do extensive research on them and presented my findings at my college's symposium. They are incredibly tricky/impossible to diagnose, so I am just a bit skeptical that he had a concussion based on the video and the CT scan, but he certainly could have.  </TEXT>

I never saw a report that he was experiencing concussion like symptoms, and he did not exhibit them on the court during that game. I also don't see much in the hit and the movement of his head to suggest a concussion. If he did indeed get one, it was a freak occurrence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, you can't read can you. I've stated multiple times that I am not accusing him, and never once did I accuse him. I'll offer you the same challenge: produce the line where I say Travis committed domestic assault.  I said that I believe the most appropriate response is impartiality, since we don't know one way or another. I think it's fair to take allegations seriously, and not to assume they're false because we don't readily have evidence to prove their validity. If I knew more about this case, and had more details than I think any of us currently have, perhaps I would firmly rest my opinion on one side or the other. I did imply that I refuse to call her a liar without evidence. Out of the two of us, you're the only one making judgement calls without evidence. 

It's a very valid point because we live in a lawful society, you can say it's not a valid but that's called insanity.

I'm sorry, I just don't base my morals on the legal system. Do you believe OJ committed double homicide? What about Robert Blake? Lot's of guilty people roaming around who were never proven guilty...like that guy riding around on my bike somewhere. 

Here's a lesson: people aren't insane just because they disagree with you. (again, your position: he's innocent, mine: impartiality...in case you forgot again) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LMA really doesn't want to be relied on too much. I've never seen a player so talented who didn't want to be the best player on the team. The way he talks, it's almost as if he'd prefer being less talented and more of a role player. I am sure he's excited Pau is back. I love LMA a lot more lately, and I will be vocally supporting him more than I have been, but it doesn't there's not a little voice in my head that is unsure if LMA loves basketball. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're the one all over the place. I am being consistent. Go back and read everything I said.

You can't say this: 

I don't believe in anything in relation to this because it hasn't been tried and she hasn't pressed charges.

and then be entirely partisan. "I don't believe in anything in relation to this, except that he's innocent." I said you're aloud to have an opinion (again, please read above), but I made it clear that yours was no better than holding a contrary opinion. You can keep citing the criteria for the US legal system over and over, but it's not going to make it a valid point.

Edit: 

 I'm not going to assume he beat his wife without proof.

But you will assume he didn't without proof.  I'd just as soon not assume, because you know what they say about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> but the fact is no one knows about the situation and I'm not going to just assume guilt because he was accused over instagram.

But you are going assume his innocence.

the burden of producing evidence is on the accuser.

Again, in the court of law. If two people make claims and we don't have any evidence in favor of either of them, and we also don't know them personally, the correct answer is to be impartial. You somehow think the correct answer is to assume the "victim" is lying, and I think that's dangerous and a terrible policy. You also don't know if there is no evidence because all you saw was some pictures on instagram. The case never got tried, you've barely heard from the "victim." We've heard a lot more from the person being accused. 

Yeah no crap I'm going to believe the person being accused if there is no evidence, the burden of producing evidence is on the accuser.

This is your policy, and it's your right to believe this. All I am saying is that it doesn't get us any closer to the real truth. It is as likely to be right as holding the opposite opinion. Acting like your opinion in a he said, she said debate is the undeniable truth and people are wrong for holding a contrary opinion is incredibly silly.  </TEXT>

Ask yourself why she would post pictures on instagram instead of actually going to the police?

I'm not in the business of getting inside people's heads and figuring out their motivations. Domestic assault goes unreported all the time (I know that for a fact). I can tell you why I think those people, whom I am close to, did not report it, but I won't speculate on the motivation of someone I don't know. I also won't even claim that I know the assault did or did not happen in this case.  </TEXT>

Dude, you are taking a side in the he said she said argument. I don't get how people don't get this. Bringing in the requirement for the US judicial system is not evidence for your opinion. Innocent until proven guilty is not a monolithic barometer for the truth. People never get charged, yet they are guilty. Murders go unsolved. 

Again, if you think he did it: it's an opinion (since you weren't there and we don't have the evidence).  

If you think he's innocent: again, it's an opinion (since we weren't there and we don't have the evidence). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just said your point was weak, because it is. Your new argument is, because I wasn't there it didn't happen. I also find it strange how someone who immediately doesn't read what people say (if you doubt me, its above) and responds on gut instinct is getting up-voted. Where is my pitchfork at? Point out the line where I pulled out a pitchfork. I just disagreed with the people who thought you had a good point. In fact, I never even said I thought Travis was guilty! I've remained neutral. What I did was argue that your opinion, that he wasn't found guilty in the court of law so we should assume his innocence, seemed off. It says nothing about whether he put his hands on his wife in a violent way. It also says nothing about his innocence. Innocent until proven guilty applies to when you have been formally charged with a crime in the US court of law. If the US judicial system is the barometer for the truth for someone, I fear they are very misguided. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you one of those "because it's illegal it's morally wrong" kind of people. It's kind of a weak point: "this is why we have a judicial system." So if I see someone murders someone and they doesn't get convicted, I just say, "whelp, this is why we have the legal system. I guess they're innocent," or if someone gets raped and their rapist gets off, "I guess I didn't get raped then. I guess they're innocent." You know how many people commit crimes and never get charged? Does that mean they didn't do it? At the end of the day, you either believe the "victim" or the "suspect." At the end of the day, it's your opinion, since you weren't there. You choose to support Travis, which is your right, but it doesn't mean that it's right.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that you had to ask his name shows why this whole issue isn't as black and white as people are making it, and people are clearly losing a bit of perspective. Now, if someone says, "the guy who currently plays, gets technical fouls all the time and regularly causes a scene," you'll say, "you mean the Kings star player Boogie?" They probably don't even need to mention the Kings. Severity of crime matters more when all things are equal. If a murder happens, you don't know about it, and you've never heard of the guy who committed it, I bet it matters a lot less to you than hearing someone you knew stole a candy bar. The common basketball watcher probably knows about Boogie's techs. You and I, who actively visit a basketball forum, didn't know who he was talking about...I think that's all you really need to know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The story: I really need to close a few accounts and get caught up with school. I have a second account, and every account I created to try to supplement my main account for ASW ended up on the same auction house as my second account. I can't keep up with it, so everything has to go except for my main account. I'd like to get some of those coins to my main account, but I am willing to take a loss. If I find a fair partner, there is opportunity for more deals, for I will be selling off entire teams. I will offer the same deal as bellow (percentage wise). I think this is fair: 50K+ for minimal work. As far as vouching for myself, I've been active on here. I've put a lot of work into this game, so I would never cheat someone else out of their hard work. Hopefully someone gives me the same respect!
 
Here is the break down
 
       I have 1,179,406
The AH takes 10% = 117,940
You will be handling the new total = 1,061,465 and you will receive 5% of this total = 53,073
