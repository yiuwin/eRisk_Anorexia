	<TEXT> Exactly, what about emergencies? What if I need to get to the hospital ASAP? What if I'm about to be plowed into by another car and I NEED to ram the car in front of me to avoid certain death? We will never be able to automate 100% of situations, but to automate 98% would be a good goal. It makes me wonder if we would really be able to put someone unable to drive into one of these things and know they will be OK. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed, although I bought a double din Pioneer bluetooth head unit recently for about $400 and the UI SUCKS, the touchscreen SUCKS, and the screen SUCKS, but I didn't want to spend any more than $400 and there weren't any better options I could find. I would have waited, but for safety reasons I needed to install a backup camera ASAP (rear visibility on the Rogue is horrible). This Harman option sounds promising, although I won't be buying it as what I have now is good enough. Had this been available 6 months ago, I would have probably bought it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I graduated with $0 student debt (my parents paid for a state school), so when I got my first "real" job, I just assumed a certain expensive lifestyle went with it. We bought 2 new cars and used credit cards because we "knew we could pay it off". After 4 years in a 6-figure job, I had no savings to show for it and still had credit card debt (and 2 car payments)! Learning to live "poor", even with a good salary would have allowed me to save roughly 15k a year for those 4 years, 60k! My wife and I had a wake up call when we started the Dave Ramsey "Financial Peace" course, and we have been budgeting now for about 3 years now and did get to $0 debt pretty quickly and stayed there with a solid emergency fund. Our retirement and kid's college funds are growing, but I am kicking myself for allowing myself to live "rich" those first 4 years just because I thought I had "arrived" with a 6 figure salary. I live in Orange County, CA, so 6 figures is not amazing considering the cost of living. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got a chameleon at a pet store in college, she was high-maintenance but very fun to own. Unfortunately, the pet stores may not provide the nutrition they need at a young age and that can limit their lifespan (brittle bones is one possibility). This caused mine to break it's arms after a fall inside the cage, and it was just a fast decline to an early death. Not recommended! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You never change the value of letterGrade in the loop, so if it does enter the while loop, the condition for the while loop will always be true, making it run in an infinite loop. You are correct that if letterGrade is not "Q" it will check the if/else, but then it will go back to the top of the loop and keep checking the letterGrade and only stop when the value changes to "Q". Make sense? you should probably change the while loop to an IF, since letterGrade never changes. </TEXT>
