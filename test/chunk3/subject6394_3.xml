	<TEXT> I've spent a while tweaking a minimal build just the way I want it, but want to switch to SSD. What is a way to save myself hours of tedious repetition? 

I also want to encrypt my entire hard drive on the SSD. Does that complicate things too much? If so, what is the least painful way to replicate my settings and installations on this new drive?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. I'll just keep coming back to this every few months and trying, I guess. 

I wish I could hear this guy's playing again. He didn't have a ton of views for his videos, but he was easily one of the best I've heard. I wonder if he could even realize some internet stranger has been trying to find his music off-and-on for years now.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there a way to search through archives of deleted YouTube videos? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to find a deleted YouTube video, posted by a classical guitarist. It's a purely instrumental cover of Johnny Cash's rendition of "Hurt" by NIN. The guy also posted a number of other covers, and I want to find them because he was just a fucking amazing guitarist. His instrumental covers had little nuances I loved in the chords that even the original songs didn't have. 

I'm 25 now. Originally found his videos when I was 15, I think. So it must have been around 2006 to 2008. 

A few people made abrasive comments about the guy's appearance playing, and one said about the music, "beautiful unlike you"

That's all I've got.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this subreddit agrees that it's going to be a dark four years. I was never involved in politics until this point in my life, but I regret my apathy too late in this election cycle, and want to avoid that in the future. 

I want to start researching third party candidates who have the intent on running in 2020, and help their cause. What's the best way to go about that?  </TEXT>
