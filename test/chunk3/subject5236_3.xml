	<TEXT> No, I hit an artery, not enough to open it up completely but just enough for it to bleed. I know it was an artery because 1. The hospital+ surgeon said so and 2. It squirted whenever my heart beat (it was fuckin gross) we got that shit to the hospital as fast as we could, bandaged it (before the hospital got ahold of one of the surgeons) and I may be exaggerating, it felt like a long time with a canyon in my hand. Also [here's more hand gore (left hand this time)](https://imgur.com/gallery/LG1tC)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I fell on an open can. Fucked my my hand pretty bad. Mind you this happened when I was 12 and I was short and our first aid kit was up high (I have no clue why) climbed on the kitchen counter, slipped on some water on the counter, went to brace my fall and BAM, hand caught a whole lotta open bean can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it didn't reach any bone. And yes it actually nicked an artery. Needed to get a cardiovascular surgeon. Unfortunately there are only two in Colorado and neither was picking up their phone. Finally after about two hours one actually answered and I got that shit stitched up ASAP. I have another large cut that happened last year if anyone is interested in more gross hand injuries of mine. </TEXT>
