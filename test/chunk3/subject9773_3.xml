	<TEXT> I was basing that idea based off a Chomsky lecture where he talked about how language and different dialects of language is essentially a vessel of ideas rather than just a form of communication. To be fair though, I haven't thought or read too much about it, but it makes sense to me. For instance it's probably widely accepted that "Nigga" is a reclaiming of the original term to signify solidarity (albeit in a very casual connotation). Outside of AAVE (what does the E stand for? I feel dumb now.) "Nigga" is replaced with "Nigger" and has a very VERY different meaning to it. So outside of AAVE you can't access that concept of solidarity with the same cultural connotations. 

Likewise in the Queer community the word "Tranny" was actually created by Australian MtF and Drag Queens to emulate the concept of "Family", but outside of the Queer community "Tranny" (much like the word "Queer", "Faggot", "Dyke", etc...) generally has a very negative connotation. 

So perhaps the pronunciation isn't always specific to the term being accessed in a specific way, but I think it is still an important signifier of where the speaker is coming from. I think that the fact that it is SO widespread probably supports that claim. I've lived in small town Texas isolated from any sort of Queer community my entire life, but for some reason when I get excited, fucked up, or any situation where I'm not making an intentional performance of my language I tend to speak fairly flamboyantly. Why? I don't really know. I can only assume that it is an unintentional/subconscious act of solidarity because lots of men that I can identify with speak in a similar way. So maybe it is just a signifier of shared culture? 
And to be clear I didn't mean ""proper" English" in any sort of elitist way, I just don't know a specific tern for more common vernacular. 

edit: I'm mostly making the argument that it doesn't necessarily matter where you are raised or who is around you, but a signifier of culture and solidarity. For instance many colored Race theorist write and use language not found in common vernacular but only in AAVE, including "improper" grammar, slang, etc.. as a specific way of separating themselves from homogenized White narratives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   merely being a detail of members of the undivided group.

Here is the problem with that.. You are trying to homogenize EVERY SINGLE human being to performing their identities as the same. This kind of thinking is what is responsible for all kinds of Queer phobias that can be incredibly oppressive and hurtful. :( 

I think about it kind of like how I do for African American Vernacular (AAV). AAV is incredibly important to creating a culture, locus of heritage, and sharing ideas in a format not accessible to "proper" English. We all perform our identities in a different way because we are all different in multitudes of ways and that is a beautiful thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously! Fuck Dan Savage! Any Queer+ that doesn't fit into his hyper Westernized-Capitalist-White-Gaysbian Utopia is abhorrent to him. He's responsible for as much destruction in the Queer+ community as the Right Wing-Social Conservatives.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The term "Nuclear family" is to describe the traditional heterosexual Husband/Wife/Children arrangement. If I had to guess I'd say this is a piece of art done by a Queer+ artist who is critiquing traditional family structures. Nothing to do with nuclear bombs though. :)

edit: After looking at it for a while I actually really like the picture, thanks for sharing it. :)

edit 2: Since I got downvoted for some reason, here is the wiki of Nuclear Family. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_family

	<TEXT> I have to take vitamins for both of those reasons. Regardless of diet complications, it probably isn't a bad idea to take a vitamin anyways. It can be hard to consistently get 100% of the nutrients you need (especially being vegetarian in not so vegetarian friendly locations). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just picked this up from Barnes and Nobles for only 15 bucks. (highly recommended btw)

Umm... I honestly don't think that this dude read more than 10 or 20 minutes of skimming and catching the buzz words. His article revolves around Gay Marriage, but that is only 1/3 of this anthologies selections. I'll admit some of the language used is a little jarring at times but never uncalled for considering the level of oppression that these authors are describing (and for the most part warranting very thoroughly).

This review doesn't do any justice to the Against Equality anthology on any level and that makes me sad considering the amount of time, effort, and resources put into independently publishing something like this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually as I'm typing this I'm drinking a glass of chocolate milk with instant breakfast (has some protein, and quite a bit of vitamins) mixed in for a bed time snack. Before this thread I never considered liquid calories/nutrition as a viable means to (heavily) supplement my diet, at least for the time being. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/RogueBlues suggested that I am probably low on iron too. Before I workout I'll make sure to have something in my stomach (which I'm sure I didn't when I tried to work out in the past). So, Iron and blood sugar to start working out safely.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats! Glad to hear that you were successful reaching your goal; hearing stories like that really gives me hope that I can start down a healthier path soon. I talked to one of my friends last night who is really into working out, and he is going to help me set up a easy fitness program to get me start being more active. And ya, instant gratification is an issue with me, it'll be hard staying consistent, but I can do it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hmm.. I haven't thought about iron. I was became anemic when I first became vegetarian, but now I make sure to take a 1 a day, and also I take an extra iron supplement every now and then... probably should do it regularly though. 

and today, I had a V8 for breakfast and I got that down SO much easier than even a single egg or banana. Liquids will definitely become part of my diet now. </TEXT>
