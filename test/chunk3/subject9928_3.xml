	<TEXT> So you're obviously dead-set on not letting a substantial amount of points in support of Castro creep into your world view. The medical internationalism of Cuba: One single point or rather thousands of lives saved? The Haitian earthquake of 2010: Western doctors set up camps and helped those who made it there. The Cubans went into the villages, stayed there long-term, learnt the language  Ebola in West Africa: Cuba sent more medical personnel then any other country. To the developing world in general, Cuba provides more health care workes than all G8 countries combined. Far be it from me to attribute all this tremendous effort to Fidel Castro personally, but can you deny that the revolution, and yes, also the regime that he furthered made these programmes possible? It's not just useful to evaluate his legacy in order to explain his success, it may be damn useful to try to emulate some of his efforts!

I, personally, don't like labelling people as "good" or "bad" not because of some moral reasoning or a total disbelief in these categories, but because it's so absolutely useless. It obstructs one's view so terribly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "maybe Castro was a bad guy"

 "sent free doctors to half of the third world, probably saving thousands of lives"

"maybe Castro was a good guy"

 "a high four-digit number of people murdered in Cuba, also the lack of freedom there in general"

I, personally, see no reason to glorify Fidel, as he definitely chose the worse option several times when facing a choice  I don't see any reason to vilify him either, as not only most dictators are far nastier guys having killed or incommodated far more people (which indeed is whataboutism), but more importantly this one has genuinely improved the lives of a great many people. Perhaps  likely  more abroad than within Cuba. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1.) "most"  I took you referred to the number. Anyway, in terms of finding the "best" it's a pity that virtually all the film prizes are tied to some nation or continent  but the Oscars don't even go to the best US films.
3.) Alright. Hosting as many Olympics as possible means you can pay the highest bribes. Medals adjusted by population: A huge no. In fact, amongst the top ten countries, the US perform worst by medals/population second only to China (http://www.medalspercapita.com/). Contracts and deals, I don't have enough knowledge on that to dispute that, alright.
6.) In terms of entrepreneurial production you're absolutely right. The rest: I'd like to stress quality once more. Obviously there are and have been a great many very talented directors and musicians and and and  in the US. Just like in Europe and Latin America and Asia wherenot a great lot of shit is being produced. It's just that the proportions seem to differ greatly, and I think that's because to become esteemed in your field bankability is so much more important in the US than artistic merit. US cultural influence on the world at large is very large but still terribly overrated.
7.) Right, not  1 on everything (no-one is, of course)  I'm sorry for getting your intention wrong. Your first post sounded to me very much like that but that's my fault as a reader. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, let's go at it one by one.
"We produce the most and the best films"  Nope, India produces more than twice as many per annum. The best? Argh. No, you confuse quality with revenue. Research: Right, that point goes to you currently. Sports: In some disciplines, yeah, in many more no. Internet: yes. Largest energy producer: Nope, China's bigger. The EU comes third at  of the US production, in no way they "pale in comparison just to the state of California or the state of New York".

I could compile a long list of objections to the claim that the US be the  1 in everything. Let it just be said that Cuba is the country that not only has free health care at home (and in a downright excellent state considering the economic problems), but also sends its doctors into half of the third world for free. </TEXT>
