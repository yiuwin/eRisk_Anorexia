	<TEXT> ^^^

Looks like you did it according the principles of the article. Good routine. I would replace the leg press though. Try to find something that doesn't bother your back. Bulgarian split squats are REALLY good. Since you are holding dumbells in your hands as opposed to having a barbell on your back it should be fine for your back. Other unilateral movements like reverse lunges  are really good too. But not  the leg press. But you should also have a hip hinge movement: a  deadlift variation or kettlebell swings. IMO you could add that to this workout, because the volume for legs is already low.

	<TEXT> Yeah, but  this guy actually say this is the only proper way to do dips ( to have the greatest power output and to be as safe as possible for the shoulders).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hey y'all, does this dip tutorial make sense? It's a lot different than other tutorials. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> In this [article](https://www.t-nation.com/training/dips-youre-doing-them-wrong) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFPihqhVVs4) Dr. Joel Seedman explains how he thinks you should do dips. The execution he recommends is a bit different than what a lot of people do. He tells you to hinge at the hips, hollow the core, dorsiflex the ankles and lean over ('think Push-Up'). Basically the position you would get If you would hang chains around your neck, thus tilting your body. Does this make sense? I always did my dips just keeping my body in a straight line. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Closed kinetic chain VS open kinetic chain exercises </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Is there any evidence to support the claim that closed kinetic chain exercises are better than open kinetic chain exercises? Some people use this claim to explain for example that dips are better than the bench press. Is this true?

	<TEXT> This is indeed a great tip, especially with moves like the handstand(pushup) where body line is very important.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Steven, I have got a couple of questions for you, I hope you can answer them (although I am a 'bit' late). 

1. my left shoulder hurts when doing pushups and bench press. Do you have any general recommendations for this?

2. When I was doing weighted dips yesterday, I felt pain in my sternum. A couple hours later when I tried doing some pushups, my sternum hurt even with such a low intensity exercise, and it still feels a bit 'sore'.I looked it up but there is little information on this. How can I do weighted dips without sternum pain? Should I just built up to it slowly, are there any form tips or something else? 

3. What is your opinion on rep tempo? Most people tend to recommend that for general purposes, a controlled eccentric and explosive concentric is best. Is this true? Are explosive reps better for strength and slow reps better for hypertrophy? 


Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to clarify: the 'press' next to the handstand refers to the amount of weight you can overhead press, right? So if you can overhead press 0.8 of your own bodyweight, you should be able to perform a freestanding HeSPU.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it matters that much. The program is solid: it's basically stronglifts 5x5 with biceps, triceps core and traps work. The core exercises are necessary anyway; bi's, tri's and traps are optional. They are trained at low volume and won't hurt your progress on the main lifts, and if you have the extra time and commitment they can give you better results physique-wise. I don't agree that the program is plagiarized; there are already a lot of versions of 5x5. Don't discard the program just based on the fact that Jason Blaha's name is on it. </TEXT>
