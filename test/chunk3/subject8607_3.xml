	<TEXT> I figure after I get the rewards for collecting all the base I can freely give any color base for my hoard. I mean at the end of the day we are all going to have multiples of all of these cards. So I offer way more for my hoard and that usually gets people to offer me trades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> its too complicated it has to be something the can be explained without too much exposition. Plus no one will buy Ren killing Han for these reasons. That one moment makes a redemption for Ren almost impossible in the eyes of fans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I don't know if anyone from this subreddit actually helped me. I want to thank everyone who contributed to my Rey hoard finally reaching 100+white base.

Hoarding Rey is such a slog because it seems everyone is hoarding her or just locking her so they don't get trade offers. Now I just hope whenever the gold comes around they don't up the needed whites to 500 or something </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am chasing all marathons except vintages. I think my favorite would be a toss up between widevision and MoM, followed by TC, film quotes and than FC. I agree that the 77s don't really feel like a marathon but I do like the aesthetic of the cards although there is way too much Threepio! Also all the awards are top notch so far! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rey you will be a jedi

Even though many will oppose you

You will succeed!!!

Sith or Knights of Ren

kill them all!

You cannot fear your destiny

We all have faith that the Force will guide you.

Anakin fell but he was redeemed

Learn the ways of the force

Kylo Ren is no match for you

Even Snoke will fall before your power!

Rey Skywalker daughter of the Light. </TEXT>
