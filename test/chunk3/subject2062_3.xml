I mean yeah you can work with a smallish 13.3" screen but it all depends on you. I would say go into different shops and see the screens/laptops for yourself and then decide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A bit of introduction. I work for a small webhoster (I'm talking like 6 maybe 7 people including the bosses) as a technican, support and developer and what ever IT taks comes around that somebody has to do. We offer so called white labeling packages, which basicly means you get our products for an reduced priced and can sell them to your customers under your name and price, however we are not their support you are.

So we have this white labeling customer let's call her A, she has the habbit to give her customers mails from us to her e.g. in regards of domain transfer or cancellation and so on. Well yesterday a customer of her calls us and asks when his domains will be canceled and when he'll get the tranfser information. I repeat severel times that I can not give him any informations and that if he wants to know more he should contact A and not us, because he was never a customer of us and because of laws and policy I'm not allowed to give anything out. But he is having none of it, goes on and on how bad of a support A is and how no one can reach her and how she doesn't know shit (well at least there I was on par with him). So after asking my bosses if it's okay if I give him the requested information and they both nod it of I give it out, but also say that if he needs anything more he should ask A not us.

All pretty dandy one would guess not to bad right? Yeah not really it was the fourth customer of her I had on the phone in the roughly 1.5 month I work there. We even told A not to do this shit, but she doesn't listen. Again acuatlly nothing big but annoying because in the 10-20mins I talked to her customer I could've gotten work for our company or direct customers done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Contractions are mostly either accusative or dative case. The first part is a preposition and the second part an article. For example "durchs" is formed from "durch" + "das" and would be translated with "trough" or "trough the" "durchs Wasser" means "through the water" or "trough water" depending on the context. Then you have different contractions depending on the dialect e.g. "son" = "so/solch ein" in the North (Hamburg, Bremen and such) or "hammer" = "haben wir" in the Rhine area (except maybe Cologne). Most of these get clearer through the context but there are some where even I have to ask the person what the fuck it means, so don't be afraid to ask if they are using slang/dialect.

I don't think there are real rules to when which syllable can be dropped and even if there are nobody ever told me them. For the most part the words have gone into our speech and are now part of the language. I'm not even sure if any teacher in Germany would mark it as an error if you write "Ich hab" instead of "Ich hab'".

If you want send me your skype name or anything and we can talk through that, it's a bit easier than through the comments here. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 24 [M4F] Rhineland, Germany - Looking for friendly chats </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-10 22:01:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey there,

I'm a 24 year old male (hence the title) who currently lives somewhere between Aachen and Dsseldorf near the Dutch border (with near I mean like 20km to next "bigger" [or more so known here in Germany] city). My biggest hobbies are reading (as in if a book hooks me I can devour it in one sitting), gaming (which mostly takes place on my pc), programming, rpgs (currently only via bulletin boards on the internet but I also like Pen Paper) and well killing time on the internet. As stated above I read nearly everything I get my hands on and currently my favorite series of books would be a German series going by the name "Die Zwerge" (The Dwarfs). Games I also like nearly everything and give it at least a shot before deciding if I want to play it through. A word of warning though I don't like LoL for various reasons.

What I'm looking for is pretty easy. A nice and easy going chat. Just talk to each other and see where it goes from there. It's easier if we have at least a few things in common so we can talk about that, if not I like to hear what other people like, but also talk about the stuff I like. It would be a nice plus if you are located somewhere nearish, because I kind of like to meet my regular contacts from the Internet in real life and that would make that easier. But don't fear if you don't want to meet up no problem. So yeah if this rambling mess of a text made you interested then contact me.

P.S. Between 9 and 17 Berlin Time on workdays I'm not really able to respond because of work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't seem to understand what is meant. Sure there are guns that are developed having sport or hunting in mind no doubt that, but guns in general are and were developed to kill an opposing force.

Then someone thought "if one can kill an human with it, why not also animals?" It was not the other way round where someone per chance found out guns are lethal to humans. The greates/biggest develpments of human history are based on either survival or on the need to wage war, be it to defend or to attack.

You are right I'm not American and I'm very glad about it. Nothing against the people that live there or the land in and of itself, but there are so many things just plainly wrond and kind of retarded. Gun laws in the U.S. are to a degree a problem that leads to deaths of innocent people. I know that forbidding the posession of guns is not the solution, but stricter laws can help to a degree.

Let's be honest if one thinks rational there is no need for an civilan to bear an gun in public, be it open or not. In my opinion a gun rarely deescalates a situation, they should always be an last effort if nothing else works. Money and stuff is easier replaced as the life of someone and be the person a "Baddie" who am I to decide who lives or dies? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can buy an HK416 semi-automatic which is an M416 (difference is that the civilian version is not full automatic). Same goes for the M16 and afaik for the G36.

I know they are not 100% identical to the ones the military around the world uses, but still these are not weapons made for hunting or sport shooting.

The whole development of guns is based on the needs of the military units (and maybe to a degree police forces), but not hunting or sport shooting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are dealing in extrems which is quite often not what reality is like. /u/RandyMarshIsMyHero said that if a game is made by one person little problems or not so good looking textures should not matter as much as if the game was made by a big company. As long as the game itself is not so bad made, that it's just no fun at all.

Let's say two sudios make the same game story wise and use the same marketing phrases. One studio is a big multi million dollar team the other is maybe 4 people. You would expect more graphicwise and soundwise etc. from the big studio with the big budget and less from the smaller team or not?

So if the developer does not lie about the game and the game is playable and not extremly buggy, then there are areas for which the money and size of the studio do matter. You don't have to like a game just because it's indie, but it's something you have to take in account for some parts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a bit more to the rise to power of Hitler than just plain old leadership. He said what many people thought but are afraid of to say out loud. He used the feeling of the population that the higher up betrayed them after WWI and that they had to pay the price for the mistakes their leaders made.

Also he produced a "we" and a "they" if you want to read morde in depth about the things he used I strongly recommend the book The Wave from Morton Rhue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ehm the sings I see what you are complaining about are just based on the fact that it's a chat not a telephone. There are not timestamps in either the image nor your text so I don't know how fast you were sending the messages but from my point of view all the rep said were responses to what you said earlier. Also the question you seem to get the most upset about seems to be the one where to file a claim and from what I gather the rep wanted to do that for you and **asked** **you** for information so she/he can fill it and maybe even speed up the process.

You should come down from your freaking high horse and fucking remember that the person behind the chat is also a human being. As I said earlier human beings are prone to err and do mistakes that is no freaking reason to get so fucking angry about such a minuscle thing.

Alas what got me the mossed "pissed off" on you was excatly this statement

  I have doubts to whether or not Engligh was their primary language

Does that really matter? Do you really only want to have to deal with people for whom English is their first language? If so then you should leave the Internet, because guess what if you are dealing with me than you are dealing with someone whose first language is not English ;) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I envy fictional characters </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-30 17:32:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The title is pretty much tl;dr, so if you don't want to read unsorted rambling with most likely many errors in phrasing and stuff then skip ahead.

I envy characters out of books, mangas, animes or short stories I read/watch. I don't mean I envy them for having some special kind of power or being special in some way. I mean sure sometimes I think it would be nice to have one of thoose, but in general I envy them because they are able to form meaningful interhuman relationships.

I envy them for having friends who are there for them (and they are there for their friends) when need be, friends who put up with the shit they do and maybe even like them even more because of it. I envy them for the people in their lives with whom they seem to be able to share happy and sad moments, but each knows that due to this sharing even the sad moments are good moments, because they didn't need to go trough them alone. I also envy them for finding love that seems to be able to bridge over all the problems thrown at them. Love that seems to be in it's truest form. A love that is more than just a romantical feeling but also a feeling for a friend.

I know this stuff is idealized, but still I image how it would be if I were this character. I immerse so deep into them that even when I lay in bed trying to sleep I sometimes just think how awesome it would be to wake up and be that character. Even when the story ends I tend to think about how it goes on for them. How they grow old see their children and the children of their friends grow and maybe even see the children raise the grandchildren. I try to imagine how happy they can feel when their life ends.

I tried many times to make friendships like that happen. I tried all I could, but in the end it didn't work out. I don't really have any close friends and to be hones never really had. Sure I had "friends" in school but most of them I only saw in school and sometimes afterwards. Sure I had people I spend a bit of my free time with, but most of them live far away and are not really close. I don't know when or why, but for me it always feels like at somepoint in all my interhuman relationships there comes the point where I withdraw a bit. I hate myself for it but I can't do anything against it. I always only show anybody some side of me never all.

Well excuse my rambling and any error I made while writing, beside that it's really hard for me to express such stuff English is not my first language so I always have to think twice about what to write. Nontheless thank you for reading and good day/night sir/madam </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was the street in any shape or form closed for the parade? From all I have seen so far that is not case. I don't say that the driver did everything right, far from it, but he is not the only person at fault.

It would not have been hard for the crowd to spread for a few seconds to let him (and maybe then a few other of the waiting cars) pass and then move on. Nobody would've been hurt and nobody really would've cared about it.

From all I've seen and read both parties involved were assholes to a degree and it's sad that people got hurt, but all of that could've been prevented from **both** sides! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Right and as I pointed out multiple times mojang authentication provides less protection than those plugins Making it pointless to care or talk about.

And I say that's not right. For the most and standard use case of a Minecraft server the Authentification provides enough protection. Seriously I did a bit of research and all hacks I could find where old and fixed. So yeah if you run online mode you most likely don't need any second authentification.

 Also, how do you not understand how pre-banning known hackers and helps prevent your server from getting hacked?

How do you think it helps? 

Do you ban their IP? 
If the person is truly a hacker and not a scriptkiddie than he'll get a new one in no time.

Or do you Ban their Username? Do I have to say how to get around that?

Banning hacker only works if you use somekind of identification that is not changed so easy that it takes them 1 or 2 minutes at max. Banning only helps against griefers and maybe scriptkiddies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like games Dan has called bad/boring/whatever and I don't fucking care. If anybody doesn't look into the games because one YouTuber says it's bad while clearly not being good at it, than the person is not a person I think would be able to play Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2 on a level that would provide them fun.

What you guys are annoyed about is that Dan does not have the same perception as you of a game nothing else. Only because you know that some of the points Dan did say were bad are not as bad as Dan viewed them, does not make Dans **opinion** is less valid.

If you want a complete objective view of a game than good luck finding it. The only thing one could be completley objective about is stuff like framerates, resolution and such technial stuff. **Everything** else in a game is based on your preferences. If you don't like a game where you have to fail a thousand times, then most likely you won't say it's a good game.

Beside that Dan never stated in the video that the game was bad in general and just money grabbing or smth like that, he even said that he does see how some people may like it. **Most** of what I've read here in the comments where butt hurt people who couldn't stand that Dan thougt some of the design decision for Dark Souls 2 were bad and that he didn't like them.

I agree it would've been better if Dan would not have covered this game, but it's his decision and all the rainting in the world will not change that. All what it does is making you look bad for not standing above stuff like that. Just keep in mind it's a freaking game and as long as you are not a developer of it or get money from it in another way it doesn't really matter for you if they sell 1000 copies more or less.

Oh and I nearly forgot to say I also strongly believe that now some people may buy the game just because they saw how bad Dan at it was and want to try it themselfes. </TEXT>

All the flaws he points out are from his point of view, nothing more nothing less. He never says anything really bad about the people who like it (except you see the Klingon thing as something bad).

So what you should get from this game: He does not like, but somehow he still likes it. </TEXT>

And how does that protect you against hacking?

 Hackers can still hack in online servers.

He nerver said otherwise, he only stated that all the plugins you listed there don't give the same protection as the online mode. Beside the fact that most likely a smallish Minecraft Server is not really a target for people capeable of hacking/cracking/whateveryouwannacallit the Mojang authentification system.

I can understand Israel saying "We don't want our people to be threathned by rocket attacks" and "We don't want to have to live with the constant threat of rockets being fired at us". Also from what I know most of the Israeli know that not all of the people in Palestina are bad or want them dead, but Hams wants them dead. Not only gone from the land but dead, whiped of the Earth. I don't think that every one of Israels reactions is right, but to a degree I can understand them.

I think the only solution whould be to throw out all extreme individuals in both states, Israel and Palestina only then a peace may be possible. But I also know that it won't be soon that it happens, if it happens at all. </TEXT>

Bad enough that my family will come by and visit me. Maybe like getting hit by a car or something in that direction.

My family never was one to show much affection to each other. Don't get me wrong we are always there for each other in hard times, but other than that we all live or own lifes pretty much afar from each other. I currently live with my dad roughly 150kms (~93miles) away from either my sister or my mother. I know for people from countries like Australia or the US it may not sound much, but in a country which is "only" 876km (~544miles) from the most southern to the most nothern part and 632km (~393miles) from the most eastern to the most weastern part that's quite a distance (more so if you don't have a car).

	<TITLE> I'm relapsing and I'm relapsing oh did I say I'm relapsing? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-07 00:11:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm currently relapsing on different things in my life I had problems with at some stages in the past. There are three big things I'm relapsing on and I try to make as much sense of it as I can.

First there is my "gaming addiction", it's not really an addiction to gaming but an addiction to the social level of multiplayer games, for the most part of MMORPGs. There was a time in my life when I was 13-15 where I played a lot of Everquest 2. I was in a small guild and they were my only social contactes out of school and family. I had fun with them and we spent much time together. In the end to much time because my marks started to get worse and worse. I stayed up all night to do stuff and yeah I also kind of fell in love with one girl in the group. However at one point I got out of the game long enough to get "free" of it. Sadly I lost contact with all of my friends but shit happens. The same happened again a few years back now. I was living alone and was studying. I had a bit of free time and whenever I had free time I would play Star Wars: The Old Republic. I got to know two guys there and we were kind of a close guild. Through these guys I also started play Battlefield 3 and met a few more people. People I now consider maybe my best friends, even through I rarely see them, because they live in Sweden and I'm in Germany. But back to my addiction. I was ball deep into both games and played a freaking lot, but mostly with the group of friends. I neglected university and other things, just so that I could play. Well fast forward to now, I los my job a few months back and I feel myself dragged more and more into the allure of MMOs. I'm kind of avoiding most multiplayer games just so that I don't go into them the same way I did before and neglect my search for a job. But I'm feeling that I will soon give in.

The second thing I relapsed on is related to my depression. I was in therapy, but because of stupid reasons I quit it and now I'm relapsing old bad behaviours I often did before. I'm revisiting all the bad things I did in the last 24 years (so all my life) and I mean all I can remember. The one time I nearly broke the foot of a good female friend of mine and stuff like that. I revisited all of them and force myself to see all the mistakes and errors I made. I don't eat as much anymore, because the food is to precious to be given to someone like me. I'm holding my hand into open flames just to feel the pain, I cut myself with a knife or scissors. And I'm thinking about ending it all.

The last thing is kind of related to the first thing. I always go back to all the messages my last gf I and texted each other on facebook. I go back to her profile and see her picture and feel the pain. I read her last response to my last message (which said that I couldn't be a friend of her, because my feelings for her where still there) and am sad how distant her answer was. I'm reading the happy messages we shared and just want this time back, but then I remember I won't get it back and it's all my fault. And then I go back to the second relapse...

I don't know how much, if any, sense this all makes for you guys out there reading this. I don't even know if relapse is the right word (English is not my first language) and I don't know what I expect from this, but I just have to get it off and I don't have anyone I could talk to about this.

Oh and sorry for bad formatting... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  they were always keen to say they came from the West 

Yeah, I say that too, but mostly because there are huge differences in many thing between people from East and the West of Germany. Heck there are differences between every little part of Germany. Bavarians are different to people from NRW who are different to people from Berlin who are different to people from Saxony. To be smaller: There are differences between the people form the Sauerland, Ruhrarea and Lower Rhine. They are very close to each other. To get from the Lower Rhine to the Sauerland you may have to drive 1-3hrs depending from where to where. Not a huge difference, still the people and mentalities couldn't be more different. Most of the German people I have spoken with about this topic said the same, they mention it just so that the person they are talking to has a better idea.

 she talked about a lot of the discrimination that those in the former East Germany feel from those in the West.

Here I go out and call that bullshit. Yeah sure we make jokes about "them" (read this as people from the former DDR), but they make jokes about "us" (read this as people from BRD). But at the same moment we make jokes about Bavarians, Frisians and so on and so forth. I have never witnissed anybody being disciminiated because they were from the former DDR.

Also that the unification is not 100% complete is freaking normal. It hasn't been 24 years as of today that the two states merged. Most of the people who are in charge now witnessed the seperation. They lived part of their life while there was a wall dividing Berlin. The seperation was there for roughly 40 years, the wall was there for roughly 28 years, does anybody really think that in this rather short time all the problems and differences are gone? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you misunderstood what they meant with that saying. For me it does not mean that the means through which the wars are fought never change, but the thing that matters in the end of the war never changes.

It does not matter if I kill my enemy with a sword, a gun, a rocket or with gas or with whatever, in the end he is dead and most likely I'll be dead too. In the end I'll give up a huge chunk of my humanity and kill someone or I die, because I failed at killing someone.

No matter how advanced or wars will be, no matter with what weapons we will fight in the end people will die because of that war. Let them be soliders or civilians, let them be male or female, let them be kids or adults, let them be black, white, yellow, green or whatever. It does not matter, people die in a war and thus war never changes.

Sure VW and Audi get the new stuff first and they all use the same same engines and stuff, but still the decisions they make are pretty independent, because they aim for different people.

Audi for example is kind of the high class brand of the VW Group, while Seat is the brand of younger people and Skoda the brand for the families who want VW quality but don't want to pay for a VW. Last but not least VW is for well the German who wants to show he is a German ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well here in the country where I live the courts ruled that you either have to accept that roaming cats get on your property or you have to build something that prevents them from doing so (e.g. a fence). Also to a degree you are liable for the damage your animal did (the same way you are liable to a degree your kid does), but it can not be expected that you always hover above your cat and prevent it from doing anything.

In your example you would most likely be liable, depending on the excat situation. If you don't build your pasture in a way that prevents predetors to get to your animals and kill them, than the owner of the cat can't be held responsible for it. After all cats are predetors and thus they have insticts and such. Also you'll have to proof without doubt that this particular cat killed the chicken/duck/turkey and not another predetor or anybody/anything else.

I'd really like to know where you are from where the responsibility for stuff like your example with the chicken is laid upon the owner if the den was not protected the right way. After all there are wild living cats outside and they would love to get to kill a chick to eat it.

Right it's not the discussion that we have, but that shows me that you would love owners and parents to observe their animals and kids all the time so that they can't do something "bad". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmh strange that here in Germany, it's common to let your cats outside if you live in a **rural** area. I have yet to meet people who think it's normal to keep your cat inside in an rural area. In a city it's a different thing.

We had 6 or 8 cats troughout the years and never anybody except this one time complained about anything they did. They could roam around where ever they wanted heck sometimes they even went into the houses of the neighbors which found it quite funny.

Where I grew up it was common that you talked with your neighbors and tried to solve the issues at hand. Not getting animal control or anything like that involved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you can't control any animal 100%. Animals have their own will, animals are not somekind of robot thing that will always do what you want them to do. However you have to take responsibillity when needed. That means if your neighbor sees your cat/dog destroy something of their property you have to replace it (or you have to have an insurance against these damages).

In case of let's say a car, one can try to teach the cat that it's bad to go onto there (e.g. with spraying them with water when you see them going there, but they must not see that you sprayed the water), but there is no gurantee that it'll work.

Also I wouldn't make fun of my neighbor in that case, but try to find a solution with him, but I also wouldn't stand him treating my animals or myself. If he would just make one comment in that direction he can be sure, that I would not only inform my lawyer but also the local police about possible animal cruelty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is, if you let your cat roam freely it's nearly impossible to prevent it from going where it wants to go. Either you have to build your backyard in a cat proof way, which costs a shit load of money (at least here in Germany) or you can't let it out. Other than that you have nearly zero chance to prevent the cat from going there.

I know that because we had a simmilar story with a neighbor of us, who didn't want our cats to roam into his backyard, because he said they shat in his patches. The thing was beside our two cats there were several other cats around and any of these shat into the patches. We tried as best as we could to prevent it, but in the end nothing worked. We didn't want to restict the cats after over 2 years of free roaming to our backyard beside that we didn't have the money for setting up the fences and stuff needed to prevent the cats from roaming.

So to a degree I agree with you, one can try to prevent the cat from doing it, but there is no guarantee that it'll do it. However not picking up the shit of your dog is just stupid and rude and I think should be punishable with the same things as if you yourself shat in the lawn. </TEXT>

I know this, because I'm a fingernail biter (dunno if that's the correct term, I bite parts of my fingernails off and have them really really short) and I often struggle with stuff like that. Good thing I always have my keys on me so I can use them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You realize it was just a suggestion. I don't know about all the things you have to consider. Also with "house" I meant more like your property.

Also maybe considering special circumstances, but you are not "allowed" to carry it just for the pure sake of carrying a gun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe not in that situation, but thats pretty specific. I'm not denying that a gun can help solve a situation, but it can also escalate the situation. A gun has two edges.

Also I'm not say no guns at all, but stricter laws. That means e.g. you are not allowed to carry them around outside of your house when they are loaded. That maybe means that you have to store them in a safe place where only person with the license can access them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  1. We're a lot further behind on technology than you'd think 2. So... you're saying that we shouldn't worry because only one or two countries have better technology than us? How many countries do you think it takes to start a war--actually, let me rephrase that: how many countries do you think it takes to win a war? Yes, our allies can step in for us--if the benefits outweigh the risks, of course.

The question is not how many countries it need, the question is how many countries would risk attacking the U.S. I for once can only think of two and if I were completely idiotic three. Maybe Russia would've the guts to attack you and maybe China and if they go full retard North Korea. No other country really wants to attack you, either because they are your allies through the NATO or they just don't give a flying fuck about you. Are you serious about thinking there is a realistic threat to the U.S. currently? Hello no.

 Many guns used in violent crimes were obtained illegally. Stricter laws make it considerably harder to obtain firearms, certainly, but criminals don't care about that. I'm not saying that everyone should have a gun because screw it, but realistically, the kinds of people that abuse firearm ownership are just going to circumvent those laws anyways, and now it's just harder for your common, law-abiding citizen to legally obtain a firearm.

Sure enough, but how many accidents and stuff like that happen with legally owned guns? How many shooting sprees were with legally owned weapons of e.g. the parents? Theese are things that would be prevent. Also I'm not saying that you should forbid all weapons, but maybe get a stricter gun law regarding storage etc.

 I work military security, and I will tell you right now that I am extremely nervous on days that they do not issue me a firearm.

And you have and are allowed to bring your own weapon to your job? See that's the problem, not that you own a gun or go on a shooting range or something like that, but that your employer does not provide you with the things needed for your job.

 Wearing that M-9 on my hip, or carrying the M-16 in my arms is a powerful deterrent. Oftentimes, someone behaving belligerently to one of our unarmed personnel will comply more quickly with an armed security member. Why? Because deep down, people are scared of guns.

Yes, they are and that's why I'm okay with security and such wearing guns when needed. However you don't need to wear a gun when you go somewhere e.g. shopping our smth like that. Yeah sure you may be attacked when you go out, but then again you maybe run over by a car while corssing the streat.

 Do you know how long it takes for the police to arrive on a scene? How long it takes for them to assess the situation before they get there, and then, how long it takes to act? In some cases, quite a while. Many of the recent mall, movie theater, and school shootouts, could have probably been prevented by the presence of one or two other people with guns.

I know how long it takes where I live. I know how long it takes German policemen to arrive when there are people who want to harm you. I don't know how long it takes in the U.S.. Hate to say it, but again how many of the weapons used there were really illegal? How many people do you think would've the guts to pull the gun and the trigger? How many of the shooter do you think would have completely lost it when they had seen a gun?

That is not an arugment you are bringing there. That's based purely on assumpation that a person with a gun would have reacted fast enough and would've shot if needed. I live in Germany and we have pretty strict gun laws and I would say we have less violent crimes per capita than the U.S.. I'm not saying one causes the other, but I'm saying that the gun laws have at least a bit of influence on that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   In most US wars, pre-modern era, conscripts and militia were common. You brought your own gun to the war as govt issued firearms were in short supply and inconsistent ammo supplies were the norm. Only uniformed soldiers got the good new weapons.

How is that an argument that can be applied to the current time? The soilders of the U.S. armed forces do get their weapon issued, so no need for you to have a gun. Also afaik there are no militas anymore in the U.S. armed forces.

 The 2nd amendment was put in place for people to protect themselves, family, and property. It is also to protect themselves from tyranny and their oppressors.

Ehm excuse me, but nowadays there are maybe one or two countries capable of threating the U.S. in a large scale on their own land for this to be relevant. It's not anymore like when the U.S. was founded that a war is being held on the turf of the U.S.

 Also the US is very vast in available land area. A family had to have firearms due to the fact that help could be days away.

Again I would argue that this is in the past. Yeah sure depending on where you are the cops may take an hour or so to get to you, but if the people want to kill you and find you before you see them you are dead. If you have or don't have a gun, there is no difference.

 If a government wants to take away a right to protect but does nothing to prevent wrong doing in the process is allowing subjugation.

You get that wrong. I'm not saying all of your violence crime problems can be solved with banning guns, but stricter laws would at least help a decent amount. I think the U.S. has in general a bit of a problem with your law enforcment forces and that needs to be addressed also. All in all in my humble non U.S. citizien opinion the U.S. need to modernize many and more things in the country including but not limited to the legal system and the law enforment forces.

 Guns can be the equalizer in situations like this.

A gun is never a good thing to have. Yeah sure the little unprofessional scumbag who is trying to rob you, you may be able to scare off, but if the person really really wants your money and stuff, they won't care and just shoot you if you pull the gun. So in some situations a gun can be an escalater.

	<TEXT>  Natrlich sind Soldaten Mrder

Wie ich diese Aussage hasse. Im ersten Moment ist jeder Soldat erst einmal ein Mensch und kein Mrder. Dazu kommt, dass die Soldaten die ich kenne lieber nicht auf Menschen schieen wrden, wenn ihnen diese Menschen eine Chance dazu gben. Leider ist es nicht so einfach einen bewaffneten Konflikt so schwarz und wei zu zeichnen, wie es einige Leute hier in Deutschland und anderen Lndern gerne htten.

Ja es gibt immer zwei Seiten bei einem solchen Konflikt, aber soll nun der Soldat in Afghanistan, welcher dorthin geschickt wurde nicht um zu kmpfen, sondern um zu stabilisieren, sich abschieen lassen, weil die Taliban keine Auslnder im Land wollen?

Ein Soldat kann ein Mrder sein, aber nicht jeder Soldat, der jemanden erschieen musste oder erschossen hat ist gleich ein Mrder. Oftmals geht es ihnen auch nur darum am Leben zu bleiben.

Btw. das mit dem schwarz-wei zeichnen trifft auch auf die andere Seite zu, ich kann verstehen, wenn man gegen einen solchen Einsatz der Bundeswehr ist, aber dann sind nicht die Soldaten, die Personen, die man verdammen sollte, sondern die Politiker, welche den Einsatz beschlossen haben.

Und wer sagt wir sollen die Bundeswehr abschaffen, lebt leider nicht in der richtigen Welt. Ein Land wie Deutschland hat auch im Militrbereich Pflichten seinen Brgern und auch der Weltgemeinschaft gegenber. Es geht leider nicht so einfach ein Land unsere Gre und Wirtschaftskraft ganz ohne Militr zu fhren.

	<TEXT> These people are the worst. When I'm out and about, even when I'm alone, I nearly never have my phone out. Sure if I'm alone and I get a message I see who sent it to me and then I may read it or most likely not. If I have company I normally don't even look except when there are several messages in a short span of time or some one calls, but even then I look to see if I can call that person back later.

People nowadays no manners at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a little add in to the Nrburgring.

From Mai to Juni 2013 the track was offered for 120 Million  (complete with the park) which would've meant a minus of 330 Million  for the state and thus for the taxpayer. In March 2014 it was announced that Capricon bought the track for 77 Million . Also I think the EU started to investigate the whole selling process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not that hard. You have primary schools, then secondary education in two tiers. Tier 1 ends with mostly with a degree with which you can either get an apprenticeship or you work on your permission to study. Both ways are called secondary education tier 2, after that you either work or you can study or get a higher degree in your job (e.g. Meister for skilled crafts and trades). This is called tertiary education.

Hochschule and German universities are basicly the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it is. The degree you get is the same as in any other university. A "Hochschule" is a "real" university (don't even know what "real" in this context means) and often times nowadays universities in Germany are Hochschulen.

You could argue that a university is a special kind of Hochschule, but the way you phrased it makes it look like a Hochschule is not on the same level as a university, which is not correct. Both are tertiary and both offer in theory the same courses and both research stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the most important thing in Germany is that we have a fomal and informal language. That means in business context always use the formal language and only switch if the other person offers you to switch it.  Assuming you are lower in hierarchy and/or younger, if you are higher and/or older it's up to you to offer the informal language.

There are some buisness contexts where it's okay to use the informal language right away. These are for example in a bar/pub/disco or a fast food restaurant like McDonalds and sometimes the taxi.

In private context it all depends on the person you are dealing with. Most Germans are okay with the informal language, but if you are not sure, then always choose the formal language. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I have to disagree with you there, for me there are different kinds of love. For example I love my family however it's not the same love I have for a SO. Same goes, that I love a few of my friends who are more than dear to me, however it's not the same love as with an SO or my family.

That's a problem not only in the English language, that the same word is used for different kinds of "love". So to a degree the sentence can make sense, it's just like to say "I like you, but not in that way for a relationship". But that are just my few cents on that topic. </TEXT>
