	<TEXT> Ever? No idea. In the time I've been supporting us (c1995)? Well, they've (Luton) only beaten us once, that I can remember, in the League Cup in 2002. So probably that. 

It's been quite a lopsided rivalry in the last twenty years, they've not mananged to finish above us since 1997, and haven't beaten us in the league since about 1991.

Our other rivalry is probably with QPR. Them winning the Championship at Vic Road a couple of years back was awful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a question I'm chucking out there: will the rise of 7s make any difference to this - I've read a number of countries are beginning to throw money at 7s (off the top of my head I believe the Dutch, Brazilians   Chinese are amongst these) because it's now an Olympic sport. 

I appreciate there's a significant difference between 7s   15s but will (slowly) a few players begin to transition from the smaller to the larger game?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Watford team of 1997 through to the 99 play off final was incredible:

Core players of: Alec Chamberlain, Nigel Gibbs, Peter Kennedy, Steve Palmer, Robert Page (c), Micah Hyde, Richard Johnson, Ronny Rosenthal, Jason Lee, Gifton Noel-Williams, Keith Millen, Nick Wright   Allan Smart. 

Took us from midtable in Division 2 (League one in old money) through to the Premier League. And I doubt most of you have heard of most of those players.  </TEXT>

For my little club he was much larger than that, and like another current club legend, Lloyd Doyley, personifies (for me at least) what my club is about - not being the best in the world, but being the absolute best YOU can be. That he was captain   scored in the play off final is merely bonus points in his favour.  </TEXT>

On a smaller scale a few years back, we had a highly rated youngster called Harry Forrester. He decided he'd rather take the big money at Villa and was last seen at Brentford a couple of years back.

	<TEXT> Because this was seen - rightly or wrongly - as a war in which (on all sides) it wasn't just the ruling classes that needed to be beaten, it was the population. So it was with the German bombing of London, British   American carpet bombing of Germany, Japanese bombing of Perth   so on and so forth. 

Doesn't make it right, but in this context, the awesome display of destructive power that the a-bombs represented were seen as necessary to cow the Emperor   the population.

Edit: and can also be seen as an early shot in the Cold War as a warning to Russia </TEXT>

	<TITLE> "Generation War: Our Mothers, Our Fathers" appears to have been quite controversial   has been recently screened on the BBC. Here's my two cents..... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-14 23:24:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This post was inspired, mainly, by an interesting discussion on the BBC which followed the final episode of Generation War on BBC2 ( iplayer link http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b042m80x/generation-war-fact-and-fiction )

The panel discussion, featuring Sir Richard Evans, David Cesarani, Eva Hoffman and Benjamin Benedict aimed to mainly try and examine a number of the issues raised by the programme which presented a grim version of WW2 from a German perspective.

The most important of these was the impression that some people have taken from this that it presents the 5 main German characters as the victims (and perhaps by extension the German people) whilst laying blame for atrocities on the hands of Ukrainians and showing the anti-Semitism of the Armija Krajowa in Poland.

As a viewer who initially was attracted to the three part mini-series as it was presented as a German Band of Brothers it seems to me to be an extremely simplistic view of the film. Whilst theres no doubt that the main protagonists  perhaps with the exception of Viktor  are often presented as only doing what they felt necessary to survive, theres no doubt that the most evil characters in the film are German  Dorn, in particular, is a grey character who despite being fanatical enough to rise high in the SS is willing to do anything to look after his own skin. None of the characters, once again, Viktor aside, seem to be innocent  Charlotte informing on a Jewish colleague, Gretas propagandising for the regime, the atrocities that both Friedhelm   Wilhelm participate in  which, for me is the main point of departure from Band..  the nuanced approach that Generation War takes with regards to the morality of war  encapsulated in Freidhelms reflection that it will bring out the worst in all of us isnt present in the American/British co-production.

Whilst I understand the issues   offence that Generation War has caused in Poland in particular, what it attempted to show, for me, was that the Second World War was not as black and white as the most common narrative for the war presents; that some of the AK was not entirely free of attitudes shared with Nazis; that the US occupying authorities was more than willing to accommodate people with dubious pasts; that populations in some areas were not unhappy to see the arrival of German soliders. Would this have been as controversial coming from a US or British production? Possibly not.  Does this devalue the heroism of Poles who were resistance fighters against the Nazis and came to take their place in Yad Vashem? Of course not.

It doesnt seem to me, at least, to be an attempt to exonerate the German youth of the despicable acts. Rather, it was a sometimes harrowing attempt to look at the motivations of people who are ultimately no different to you or I. Its one of the things which often crosses my mind when reading about World War 2, the Spanish Civil War or indeed any of the great events of the past. Could (or would) you or I behave differently to the ordinary populations of countries where great upheavals happen? Id like to think I would. That I would sign up for the International Brigades, to fight fascism. But looking back on events with hindsight makes it rather easier to make those judgement calls than for people at the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> McGugan has lived up to his billing from Forest supporters. Very inconsistent. That said, he was excellent against Barnsley a couple of weeks ago. Linked up superbly with Danny Pudil. 

The free kick was my vote for GOTS, but I'd totally forgotten about the Angella flick, which was wonderful. 

It's not so long ago (ie. our last season in the prem) that we had to include a penalty in our goal of the season list, because of the dearth of decent goals. 

This season, whilst a disappointment, has seen some super efforts.  </TEXT>

British POW mail was "despatched abroad by the Post Office. Between 1941 and 1945, 26,250,000 parcels (both Red Cross parcels and parcels from next-of-kin) were sent from Mount Pleasant via Portugal to Geneva (despite difficulties in getting around or across enemy territory) where they were transmitted forward by the International Red Cross. About 200,000 letters per week were sent to POWs from Britain by air to Lisbon, where an exchange system operated with mail from Germany for German prisoners in Britain and Canada. The Post Office was in effect a fourth service, vital to the survival of the state and performed its duty well despite labour shortage, the need to recruit and train inexperienced staff, and enemy attack." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think - in part - it's not terribly accurate. Certainly looking at Trotsky's actions during the Civil War, he wasn't afraid to do things that would make most of us give him a wide berth. 

Precisely because he wasn't able to confirm himself in power like Stalin, it's impossible, really, to compare the two. 

Certainly Trotsky's supporters would like you to believe that he wasn't anywhere near as blood thirsty as Stalin, but - from memory - he wasn't a man unafraid to use violence in the service of his cause. It's just that once turfed out of the Soviet leadership, he wasn't really in a position to use any.
