	<TEXT> It seems that you are either a vanilla player or a console player, because there are mods for all your issues.

Immersive Winterhold College will let you transfer your archmage title to Toldfir and you can get it back whenever you want, I did this in my last gameplay, I've finished all the Master spells quests and then took back the title.

Werewolves have several mods which makes playing with them on Legendary and even with mods that improve enemies AI worth it

There isn't much we can do about thieves guild, only if you are interested in being really stealthy, otherwise can you really say that you were acting like a thief?

It is part of the game if you want to roleplay or not, skyrim allows you to choose your adventure, you can be an altmer that worships Boethiah and likes to party on the gray quarter, it's your character, that is why Skyrim is alive, because people can change their character whenever they want, I wouldn't be playing skyrim if I had to do everything that the game told me to do, if it were like that, 2013 would be the last year that Skyrim would have a major relevance on gaming community  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "I hope to see a TES game where you're not born special." 

People wouldn't want to play that game, most people play video games because they want to be the chosen one and since the sort of thing doesn't exist IRL we content with video games. 

Of course, they could make the quests a bit more difficult or to take some time to progress, but those faction quests can't be as long as the main quest, and the main quest in Skyrim ain't that long if you think about it - ignoring going through 50 dungeons, caves, etc.

Also there are some misconceptions here, the Listener is only the leader of the Black Hand, not of the DB, you are the Harbinger because neither Aela, Vilkas or Farkas would want to be the Harbinger, Tolfdir was supposed to be the arch-mage, Brynjolf says that he doesn't want to be the guild master so him and Karliah made you the Guild Master, also speaking of Karliah and Brynjolf, the three of them have the same power as nightingales and I haven't even talked about how The Blades treat the Dragonborn like shit, even though they are supposed to respect him.

Talking about merit: you can't do much about only two of those which are the dragonborn and the listener, all the rest you ought to, or at least should, work hard to become their leader, want to be the Harbinger? Be a badass warrior and also evolve your werewolf powers, want to be the archmage? be a badass mage and learn all master spells, want to be the guild master? be a badass thief and pickpocket everybody, which is hard in vanilla.

I only partially agree with you, we should work harder to get all the titles we get in TES, but that doesn't mean our character shouldn't be born special, don't you wanna be the dragonborn? Fine there are mods for that, but there aren't any mods that would be able to add all the dragonborn features that the game has. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because in the past time would flow slower, much like what happened with inflation and currencies, what you could buy with 3 dollars in 1970's you can't buy nowadays, much like time, what you could do in 15 minutes in the past, you have to do in 3 nowadays. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm struggling to keep playing it because there is too much dialogue and there are some useless NPCs, you are there listening to them for 5 minutes and nothing that they say is really useful. I guess they overcompensated the lack of dialogues of Skyrim, but that is too much, it almost feel as boring as Season Unending, but at least in Vanilla you only have one Season Unending and 
Enderal is all dialogues, at least from the main quest, are like that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Weird how the most obvious, at least for me, DB mod isn't here:

[The Dark Brotherhood Resurrection Part 1](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25941/?) - I'm not a huge fan of this mod, but maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.

On the mage path you can download a lot of mods such as Undeath,  Moon and Star, Wrath of Nature, there are a lot here.

On the thief path: The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal

On the Dragonborn path: Konahrik's Accoutrement (my favourite) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And who said anything about Saudi Arabia? I didn't, also Saudi Arabia doesn't even allow burqini, women there are supposed to wear a abaya. Your cherry picking of "Morocco and Turkey" is quite similar, also, look how odd, there was a ban in headscarf in Tunisia, but after its revolution in 2011 the ban was lifted.  Don't accuse me of "cherry picking" when I didn't point any country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I read somewhere once - if my mind isn't playing tricks with me again -, that The Companions quest line was supposed to be deeper than it is, which you could see from Vilkas first dialogue with Kodlak and the Silverhand also had so much potential, but it was all wasted because you can enter the ruin, kill everybody, recover the pieces of Wuuthrad and that's it, even searching for the totems would be more amazing if we had to go to a small part of Hircine's realm, or any other hunting grounds, similar with what happened with Shegorath and Pelagius' mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Genetics says that men's hair comes from their mum, so as long as it isn't your maternal grandfather you are good to go haha.

I think a good transition would be: Black Sabbath, guitar, the one with sunglasses hair ad style, button down shirt, skydiving and the one with your cat. I think it goes smoother this way, it's not like: first picture(rock style) "girl when we hang out I'm gonna be like that" and second picture (button down shirt) "but when we are at your parents I'll dress like this so they won't know that I destroy that pussy every night " </TEXT>
