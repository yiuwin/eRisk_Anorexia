	<TEXT> I have the 88 warm palette, its OK.... I bought it when I was first getting into makeup a few years ago.  However the new revealed palettes are amazing. Soft shadows, pigmented, last a long time on me. I have both the revealed 1 2 and they're just beautiful. Great selection of mattes as well. And just in case you don't know, revealed 1 has dupes for almost all shades on naked 1 and 2. Revealed 2 has dupes for naked 3!! GOOD dupes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I was going to say the same about the teeth, it happens to me as well. The red OP chose is not a blue based red, so it can make teeth look yellower than they're. I would say get some crest whitestrips. I've gone through a bunch of them and my favorite one was the professional effects kind. The red does suit you a lot and compliments your eyes and completion! I have to say I usually take my mom's advice, except for when it comes to makeup! Haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When people stick their noses when they aren't even asked.
I recently lost 8 kg and went from 67kg to 59kg (22yo, 160cm). Naturally my stomach is quite flat but my legs are more chubby.  I finally started feeling better about my body. Then today, this random lady at work who I barely ever talked with came up to me and said: "you're pretty, but your legs are fat. You should work on that" 
Excuse me?!?! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [QUESTION] I want to start exercising from home and need help </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-14 19:27:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the past few months I went from 148lbs (67kg) to 132 lbs (60kg) and I'm 5"2. I was very happy with my progress, but I have plateaud for about a month. So... Obviously it's time to incorporate exercise. I want to lose around 5 to 10 more pounds, but I also want to get more toned and defined. 

I can't afford a gym, so I want to start going on walks. I also want to start doing exercises to tone (squats and stuff like that) and was wondering what you can recommend me as an exercise routine. How many times a week should I walk and how many times the other exercises? What kind of routine? What move how many reps?

Thank you!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good timing on this question, since just yesterday I was so ticked I thought I would kill somebody.  
A client took a moisturizer tester by herself. I was on my way to give her a spatula to get the product out and saying "wait let me give you a spatula for that", but she decided to stick her dirty finger in the cream and took a giant blob one could never put on their face. Although...my surprise came when she started rubbing it on HER FEET. 
Obviously I told her off, and she left my counter. 
When I turned around, I also noticed she left her coffee cup on the counter. 
Who does this?!?!?! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cetaphil cleanser, acne.org moisturizer. My biggest tip would be to take moisturizing very seriously from day one! As in, tomorrow pretend your skin is super dry, including lips and eyes. (Get an eye cream even of you're a man please!!) 
Another thing I like is incorporating jojoba oil into your moisturizer, just add in a few drops and mix on your palm. This was something I learnt on acne.org
Now for me, now I'm on month four and have been experiencing some horrible dryness on my arms. Get a very good body cream and apply that from day one as well. I'm sure if I had done that my issues wouldn't be so bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You love the product, but the packaging is fussy/bad/ugly looking.

For me, MAC prolongwear concealer. I went through three of these, even though the stupid pump dispenses enough product for three uses! I get annoyed every time I use it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I have been on 40mg a day since starting the course and didn't experience an initial break out. I stopped breaking out completely before hitting two months. You never know how you will react to accutane until you take it. Keep in mind having a bad IB is totally worth it if it means clear skin when it's done. Good luck! </TEXT>

When he left one of the ladies who works with me said my friend looks like a wonderful guy, and by the way he was looking at me maybe I should give him a chance at a relationship because it looks like he adores me. Well yeah, I adore him too! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pulling out is not birth control. You must use a condom, they're cheap (a baby or an abortion would be more expensive!) Be responsible about your sex life. If you aren't ready to get pregnant you need to understand that it is your responsibility to use some sort of pregnancy prevention method. Birth control pills, condoms. You should be aware of the fact that you can get pregnant by just a minute of sex even from pre cum. Take this issue under your control and don't expect your man yo wrap it up without you telling him. Go buy condoms. Good luck  </TEXT>
