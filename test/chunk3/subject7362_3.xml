	<TEXT> i highly doubt all the players on the ice saw whether it was a clean hit or not. and in that case the philosophy seems to be that action is always better than inaction, thus we see these scrums and brawls after genuine accidents and clean hits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing that hasn't happened much in Trek but that I think would be interesting would be the introduction of an extra-galactic power. They could be much more powerful than the Dominion, Federation or Borg, but still have some realistic limitations on their abilities (so not Q-like in power). For example, they may be more powerful, but have a small population, or difficulty bringing in reinforcements, or trouble dealing with local environmental conditions. There would be lots of opportunity for drawing from Earth's real history, particularly about the age of colonization and the subjugation of indigenous people, and the Milky Way powers could be depicted as underdogs struggling and infighting in the face of a clearly superior rival. I think the story would be best if it wasn't focused completely on the invading force. Sort of like how in The Walking Dead the real conflict doesn't happen between people and zombies, but rather between rival groups of survivors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's possible or even likely that, from a human perspective, the most recent common ancestor of humans and cephalopods looks an awful lot like a contemporary cephalopod. the science may be junk but if you can get past that it's a rollicking good episode. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> that whole scene with the wives made me think of the amazing movie Raise The Red Lantern. It's a period piece about a harem of wives and the intrigue and competition for favour that consumes everything they do. It's been so long since I've seen it - it really is brilliant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do I feel? Betrayed, outraged, exasperated. Williams walked into office during the richest time in the province's history yet ran deficits, cut tax rates in upper income brackets, failed to diversify the economy away from oil, and masterminded a transparently self-serving megaproject that is either going to result in a default on our debt or the crippling of our economy for a generation or more. All of which was made more unbearable by his unassailable popularity among the electorate. Even now some people think the only thing that could save us is if Danny came back to politics, and pointing out it was Danny who got us in this mess to begin with makes absolutely no difference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there are a lot of parallels. those you mentioned plus he was rich when he became premier and milked the system to his own benefit, as we can assume trump will do. he also expected the rules to be different for him than they were for us plebes, just like trump.
edit: and don't forget danny's attitude about litigation: as soon as someone said anything critical about him it was straight to the bullying tactics and threats of litigation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> he could play hardball with them to get them to waive their no-movement clauses - tell them he won't re-sign them after their current contract is over. they'd either have to retire to stay in vancouver thus never getting another shot at a cup and giving up several years of multi million dollar salaries, or go into free agency and leave vancouver anyways. (this would obviously be wildly unpopular with the fan base but could help shuffle them out the door.)
alternatively, if they are so desperate to stay in vancouver maybe linden can convince them to sign contract extensions right now - 3 years for 2million/per year with a full ncm. it's either that, or retire, or uproot your family. it's wouldn't be unreasonable for them to take a discount contract to stay at home, in exchange for hamstringing the team's rebuild for the past 3 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> one-strapping was casual whereas two-strapping made it look like you actually gave a shit, which was definitely not cool. until the mid 90s when grunge came to town (my town was small and a few years behind the times) when one-strapping and two-strapping were just connected to two different subcultures. there are people just a couple years older than me who to this day cannot wear a backpack on two shoulders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i have to second this. you can get a really nice pair of binoculars for under $300. there is almost no learning curve when it comes to using them. They are so small you won't even think twice about taking them everywhere with you. They make the sky so much more fascinating to look at. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've definitely seen instances where the transporter operator must've had ESP in order to beam up the right people. Can't recall specifically what they were right now, but I know it's driven me crazy multiple times. Maybe now that I've brought it up you'll start noticing too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not unlike when some character in the middle of a crowded room says "three to beam up" and the transporter room always beams up the right three people. This will happen even if it's a chaotic environment, if it's a mix of Starfleet and non-Starfleet, and if some of them have communicators while others don't. It's tough to think of a reasonable in-universe explanation for this, outside of some deep computational intelligence within the transporter or communications systems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gonna go out on a limb here and guess that what we hear isn't the officer recording the log, but rather the log playback. The officer doesn't announce the date at the beginning of each recording, the computer simply records the date in the file and then plays back the date in the officer's voice during playback. It's just a bit of automation to add consistency to ship's logs. </TEXT>
