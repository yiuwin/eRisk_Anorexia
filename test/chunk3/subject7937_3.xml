	<TEXT> Artorias. Fair fight. You have to be alert. Dodge well. Not get greedy. Heal at the right moments. All in all you have to really git gud to actually beat him. And soloing him with melle only is the best thing. You will die numerous times. But it is never frustrating.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine was when I finally beat Knight Artorias. I died over 10 times to him. But dying never bothered me because the fight itself was such an amazing experience. When i finally beat him i was super proud as i knew i dodged well, attacked well. It's also my favorite boss fight in the entire game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For instance our character. First he/she has a purpose to ring the bells. Then, to reach Anor Londo and so on. This prevents him/her from going hollow. We get up from the bonfire and just get going. We can also presume a strong will power helps us stay just an undead. Conversely sometimes we give up on a character and start a new one. It is believed in the community that the abandoned character goes hollow in his world under such circumstances. </TEXT>
