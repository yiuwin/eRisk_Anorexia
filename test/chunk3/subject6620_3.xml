	<TEXT> Sheldon (who was previously the best character) goes to over the top with his shit and just becomes annoying and hard to watch. 

[Most of the other characters do that too.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization)

Also the show ruins all of its serious moments. Chuck Lorre has always said Sheldon doesn't have any kind of autism or Aspergers type stuff. So even though the show has potential to have good heartfelt serious moments where Sheldon opens up about what it's like to live with whatever disorders he clearly has, the show instead takes the lazy route and just has Sheldon say "oh I'm quirky, sorry!" Then he does some stupid shit for the laugh track.

Where you are in season 3 you might still be able to argue Sheldon is just "quirky". But by season 9 he goes so far overboard you could only explain it with some kind of mental illness type thing.  </TEXT>

Irving annoys me. Not his brother Albert though, I think Albert's scenes are funnier than Irving's.

Monty also annoys me.

But that's it. I think the show actually does a good job of making almost all of the characters likeable (unless they're not supposed to be likeable like Rodney). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In season 2 episode 9, iChristmas, it is mentioned that Marissa Benson (Freddy's mom) is single. So maybe she married or dated Barry B. Benson, had Freddy, then broke up with him or crushed him or something.

And in season 3 episode 3, iSpeed Date, there was a deleted scene that revealed that Freddy's dad's name was Leonard. But since it is a deleted scene it's not official. I like to think that Dan Schneider was going to reveal Freddy's dad name but then didn't just in case a movie like the Bee Movie came along one day.

A few of Freddy's other family members are mentioned throughout the series such as his aunts or his great grandfather. But none of them are seen so they could either be bees or just be humans on his mom's side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's called [Milo Muphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_Murphy%27s_Law). 

I'll let Wikipedia explain it:

 The series revolves around the title character, Milo Murphy, who is the descendant of Edward A. Murphy Jr., the namesake of Murphy's law, which states that anything that can go wrong *will* go wrong.

It's supposed to premiere this October. 

It stars Weird Al as Milo Murphy. Also according to Wikipedia it also has Christian Slater,  Vincent Martella (he voiced Phineas) and Dee Bradley Baker (he voiced Perry the Platypus, all the clones in Star Wars: the Clone Wars, Appa and Momo from Avatar: the Last Airbender, and probably tons of other stuff).

It sounds great to me! This could fill the [big honkin hole in my heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09AQcK8EDT0) left by Phineas and Ferb. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the creators of Phineas and Ferb (Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh) are creating a new show for Disney XD called [Milo Murphy's Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_Murphy%27s_Law). It's about Milo, a descendant of Edward Murphy (the Murphy who thought of Murphy's Law). And so anything that can go wrong for him, will. It's supposed to premiere in October. IIRC the creators said its the "spiritual successor of Phineas and Ferb" or something like that.

It stars Weird Al as Milo and apparently Christian Slater as well, according to Wikipedia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say season 7 or 8 is when it started sucking. The only seasons I'd ever go back and watch again would be seasons 1-4. But IIRC seasons 5 and 6 weren't bad. And almost every season has at least one really good episode. Even the bad ones.

Still I think the show is good background material. Or if I wanna browse Reddit and also have a show on in the background. Each episode has maybe one or two good jokes. And stupid jokes can still be good if you're in the mood. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ya Spencer is definitely the best part of that show. For me the main cast, best to worst goes: 

Spencer ,Carly, Freddy, Sam.

Sam is just awful. My little brother thinks she's hilarious though. When Freddy said Sam licked his ice cream cone I lost all respect for her. You don't lick a friend's ice cream cone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been watching this show with my little brother for a bit. Is good. Most of it is only good for littler kids but every once in a while you see something genuinely funny. 

Also they talk about smoothies a lot in this show. It's like some kinda recurring theme. </TEXT>
