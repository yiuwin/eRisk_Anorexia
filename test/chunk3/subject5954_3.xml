	<TEXT> I have found a japanese group called Ikimono-gakari but found nowhere to listen to their music online in a respectful quality. I've been wanting to listen to japanese bands for a while but never found a good site. Any advice on where to surf to? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking for a gif from a meme I saw a whole while back called "Did someone say anime?" (Something like that) and then the gif beneath it. The gif was a classroom and some guy smashed through the door/wall(?) super excited/hyped. He bursted in from the left to the right. </TEXT>

Otherwise try searching in google for "Automata kits", might help!

	<TEXT> I've read about the Oppo PM-3 but I'm a bit worried it won't deliver as  strong as I want to. As most sources I've read describe it as a more all-around sound and isn't accentuating bass as much as others. Do you think it will bring out the tracks I've given as example the strongest? Also what are your thoughts about the combination of the Oppo PM-3 with the Oppo HA-2 either between laptop   mobile phone (HTC10 in my case) ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read everywhere that they increase the quality through analog output, am I wrong? And kind of but for music, my music examples should give you a pretty good idea of what I'm looking to experience.

If any questions feel free to ask more and thank you for the help already! </TEXT>
