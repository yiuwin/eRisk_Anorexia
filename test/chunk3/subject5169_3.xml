	<TEXT> There is nothing wrong about missing home. It also sounds like you had an awesome childhood with cool parents. A few months stateside and I think you'll find yourself really excited for your next adventure. I think this is a normal feeling and I don't think you should be alarmed! Basically the same thing everybody else said, lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL, I've heard this before on reddit. I'm an American but this is like maybe the very least weird thing to me. I completely understand the prescription medication commercial thing and others along those lines. But... like c'mon there's a tiny crack in a stall. It's still pretty easy for me to poop. Basic human dignity??? Forgive me but that is laughable from my perspective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While this does exist, I wouldn't call it anywhere near socially acceptable. If two average american parents were talking and one said "I need to go pick up 8 year old julie from her beauty pageant" The other parent would think that it was very strange. Its popular mostly because people like to laugh at the absurdity of it </TEXT>
