	<TEXT> Not a high school teacher, but when I was in high school I was doing singing valentines and I had to sing "For the Longest Time" to one of my past teachers. One of the lyrics I had to sing was "You're that voice I'm hearing in the hall, and the greatest miracle of all, is how I need you, and how you needed me too, that hasn't happened for the longest time." It was pretty awkward. I didn't know whether to make eye contact or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the reason why I feel more inclined to sympathize with Varner is because no one else did in the episode. What he did is awful but it's extremely uncomfortable to watch 7 people gang up on someone and put them on blast, even if that one person is in the wrong. I just put myself in that situation and know I would feel a lot shittier being Varner than Zeke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To me, new school was all about highly strategic gameplay and new twists as far as the seasons themes. If you look at the winners of these seasons (BRob, Kim, Tony, Natalie A) they all played really strategic, innovative games.

I feel like the post-new school designation is necessary because now Survivor has taken a step back from that twisty strategic focus and has regained the social factor from early in the series. Post-new school to me still has a lot of twists, but is more focused on emotional strategy rather than traditional strategy, and more focused on the relationships between people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> how would that benefit you though? If they were suspicious or resentful of that person because they went to the luxury exile, they would be towards you too. If they were fine with it, it wouldn't hurt that person. And I feel like most people would see through that as a shallow attempt to put the target on someone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It makes me sad because Survivor is probably one of the only things that brings him joy in life so he clings to it and gets over obsessive with it. It's creepy as fuck yeah but I feel bad for him.

Then again I'm just some redditor playing armchair psychologist on him, maybe he's actually a serial killer who knows. </TEXT>
