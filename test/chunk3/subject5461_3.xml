[Angel](http://imgur.com/a/JKn2c) - Aptly-named Archon Wizard

[Blanca](http://imgur.com/a/lN3fh) - Really just wanted to showcase those wings

[Charmeine](http://imgur.com/a/qGz0i) - My head canon made her a little off-kilter, so her theme is chromatic and technicolor

[LadySun](http://imgur.com/a/6XVVM) - Older character. I always saw her as a sort of secret agent

[Leina](http://imgur.com/a/4lLTo) - Easily my favorite, the red-on-gold theme goes so well with those weapons

[Suzette](http://imgur.com/a/HbyWV) - Skycutter is a mainstay for people making a holy warrior, and she's no different. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True story, way back in Season 3 when UE was first released but before Yang's Recurve, Chakram was the build of choice along with the Spines of Seething Hatred, because turning it into a generator let it benefit from the 6-piece bonus. Last season after I got my stash space I ditched my DML, cubed the Sword of Ill Will and tried it again. It held up surprisingly well if you can max out your Hatred as well as your Discipline, but that slight balance issue aside it was a lot of fun to go back to Xena: Warrior Princess. </TEXT>

Witch doctors can hex the entire track, slowing the competition, and demon hunters can lay spike traps behind them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Act 6 in the Skovos Isles, of course! If I were to speculate, I'd imagine a cool idea for the final boss would be... Inarius!  And why not? He's an unfathomable narcissist, and he's got a bone to pick against the Nephalem (remembering Uldyssian from the Sin War books, who was his downfall). Last time anyone saw him, he was being dragged off to Hell by Mephisto to be tortured for all eternity, so he's bound to look pretty gruesome during the final encounter (the demons mutilated his perfect face, then placed him in a room of millions of mirrors so he'd be forced to see what he'd become). Say he finds a way to escape his torment and goes to the Amazon motherland in search of Mysterious Artifact MacGuffin #1903 that he will use to destroy humankind, or something. Sounds like a Diablo 3 story to me :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the barb doesn't mind switching to a support role, there are very interesting zero-DPS builds that can group enemies together, heal, provide the wizard various buffs, all while the wizard (usually some kind of Archon build) does the brunt of the damage. It's a tricky playstyle and a bit counter-intuitive, but support builds are very sought after among advanced players. Above all else, have fun! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm one of those weirdos that actually likes set dungeons. The game has always been missing an actual challenge that isn't solved by bigger numbers, so I consider it a sort of Diablo: Puzzle Mode. A little bit of theorycraft, some outside-the-meta thinking, and some truly satisfying payoff at the end is what makes it so unique. Seriously, mastering the Wastes dungeon was the kind of fist-pumping satisfying moment that beating a high GR will never match. At any rate, take heart that it's still entirely optional, and all you're missing out on are these badass wings and some bragging rights. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't entirely divorce the issue from opinion, but fair enough. I agree wholeheartedly that morbid obesity is contributory to bad health problems, but being underweight has its share of [complications](http://search.proquest.com/openview/33bbb7ab6291fed6453a54992d87fdf4/1?pq-origsite=gscholar cbl=2041065) as well. So then, a happy balance should be maintained, and while she's no Jessica Alba, she's also no Melissa McCarthy. I'll even grant you that body acceptance, while definitely a positive movement overall, can in its most extreme cases be detrimental. I just simply think Ariel Winter is the worst example you could have picked to illustrate your point, because she just... isn't fat. I'm sorry, in the name of intellectual honesty I'm trying to see your side, but by all accounts she's just a healthy woman. Fair point, bad example. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I pre-ordered RBR (guitar bundle) about a month ago on Amazon to get those two bonus songs. Since then I had to get a new card for the same account, meaning the old one I used to make the purchase would have been declined. I've put in the new information and I guess it's on the way, but I'm a bit confused on how pre-orders are supposed to work in online retail. Do they run the card when you initially order the game, or when they actually ship it? If the money was already taken from my account then the change wouldn't have mattered to them, right? Did other Amazon pre-orderers get the game on the day it was released, or are others still waiting on their game to get through the mail? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never heard of Arial Winter before just now looking her up, but as a point of order, I'd argue that she's not fat and definitely not unhealthy. See, the "ideal" feminine beauty as seen by modern society, i.e. thin and tan, is a relatively recent construct. Consider old artwork: in most paintings of the likes of Rubens or Boucher, the hottest woman they could think of was usually a little bit chubby and extra pale. These were qualities tied to nobility: it meant that she could afford extra food and didn't have to work in the fields like some peasant. At some point in the last century, personal trainers, vegan diets, and sun-bleached vacations became the more expensive trappings of high society, so our perception of beauty changed to suit that instead. A part of me wonders if the entire concept of beauty isn't just an evolutionary hard-wiring in our brains to determine who has means, but I digress...

My point is, the natural order would have us be not too fat or too skinny, and Miss Winter happens to be just about right, in at least one heterosexual dude's estimation. If you need your celebrities to be gaunt supermodels with their skin hanging off their bones, that's your hangup. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This one P.E. game that my 5th grade teacher made us play on a rainy day. All the kids (this game doesn't work without like 30 or more) stand in a rank-and-file grid, at arm's length from each other. One kid (the cop) chases another (the robber) through this grid and the game ends when the robber is caught. The grid kids hold their arms out, forming a Red Rover chain that connects all the rows and can't be passed through by the cop or robber. When the teacher yells "Switch!", all the kids turn their bodies 90 degrees with their arms still outstretched, so the rows become columns. It was insanely fun for the cop and robber (and arguably the teacher who would constantly troll the cop by switching at the best time) but super boring for the kids in the grid so it never caught on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not so sure. At the risk of upsetting the Last of Us circlejerk, as a fan of both movies and video games I feel like we're all just so used to games having extremely simple narratives that when a game comes along that does something a bit more nuanced, we tend to compare it to non-interactive media and call it just as good. Judged as a movie, The Last of Us is middle-of-the-road popcorn filler I'd have enjoyed in the moment but forgotten ten minutes after leaving the theater.

And you know what? That's fine. Every medium has its strengths and weaknesses; movies may be more engaging with their complicated narratives and ambiguity, but they'll never offer the investment I gain from actually immersing myself in the role of the character. That's why I'm generally skeptical of film adaptations of games in general; the story I got from, say, Mass Effect worked perfectly fine without having to shoehorn it into a completely different format. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where Archon builds are concerned, Firebird's does more damage while Vyr's is more tanky. Worth mentioning, however, is how Vyr's works better in the early game. The FB Archon is a bit gimmicky and dependent on supporting items, so Vyr's, with its more specialized bonuses, is arguably more powerful in the early season, before you've completed your initial item hunt. Just a thought, anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has to do with the creation mythology of the universe. There's this guy, Anu, who is basically God. He consists of all things, but he wanted to make himself pure so he cast out all the evil and loathing from his pure form, which coalesced into a 7-headed dragon called Tathamet. Long story short, they fought and killed each other and their bodies effectively became Heaven and Hell. Tathamet's heads became the great Evils, and the angels came from the corpse of Anu. The Eye of Anu later became known as the Worldstone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, Wastes wasn't that bad for me. I had more trouble with Raekor's and Earth sets (which were only medium difficulty themselves for me). The trick to making it about a million times easier is Sprint - Gangway. Keep it up constantly when near enemies and you'll stun enemies just by walking by. Also, resist the temptation to stay constantly whirlwinding; those dust devils kill things faster than you can Rend. Just walk around, find a dense looking group of mobs, Sprint into them, use Ground Stomp - Wrenching Smash to draw them in, and bust out a Rend while they're all stunned, then wipe them out with a Whirlwind. Once you get used to the playstyle, they won't even touch you.

On a personal note, this is literally the only dungeon I've done a second time just for fun, simply because of how badass you feel when you get it right :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I can remember a time when T6 was considered incredibly hard on solo play for most casual players. Most were content to farm T4 or so, with only the more specialized players gunning for T6. I think that's the idea Blizzard wants to shoot for now: a stabilized speed level, and a more challenging "bonus" level reserved only for powerful builds not optimized for speed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed on most points, although where I think you're mistaken is in thinking T13 was meant to be the standard that all builds should efficiently farm at. I put it to you that T10 is still the baseline by which effective speed-farming builds are judged, and T13 is designed to be a harder challenge for people who don't necessarily want to do GR's. I'll grant you, certain sets could definitely use a tune-up (lookin' at you, Wastes) to catch up to that bar, but as far as I'm concerned ww barbs and angry chicken docs don't need to go any farther than ~GR50 to be worth building toward. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they did balance out the sets so that every build was GR60 viable, we the community would simply move that threshold higher like we've done in the past, and complain that more builds aren't GR70 viable. They can tweak the sets until the end of time but as long as they aren't perfectly balanced, the meta will still exist. Some sets simply exist for reasons other than pushing the highest levels possible, and that's OK. In fact, that's exactly how I like it.  </TEXT>
