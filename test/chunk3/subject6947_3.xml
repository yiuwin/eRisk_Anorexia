I waited all day for your AMA so I could ask you this.


* What was it like being the helmsman of the *Defiant* in *Star Trek: First Contact* as well as sharing dialogue with Michael Dorn, (considering you and he were the only living bridge crew)?

* Any stories from while you were on set? 

* How did you get the role? How did you react? 

* I also wouldn't be a proper Trekkie if I didn't ask if you were a Trekkie/fan before the role, and, if not, did the role turn you into one? </TEXT>

After 7 years, I accrued about that many 360 games, so assuming a similar rate, it'll last me into the next decade.


If you can, get a MyBook. (It's the size of three side-by-side One disc cases) It does require external power support, and it is a brick-plug, but easy enough to put on a bottom plug/end of a strip.

Plus, it's shiny and black, so it matches the console. :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They started filming *Jessica Jones* in Feb.

Maybe his Marvel contract prevents doing outside world, or, alternatively, assuming Locke becomes the major character they seem to be priming him to be, if he's busy doing *Luke Cage* or *Defenders* during H6 production, they'd need to replace him, so maybe they are preempting that in the interest of vocal continuity. </TEXT>

Maybe even have a semi-separate press conference for it. Split the conference time in half. 

Like do an hour-long EA conference, and have a separate hour-long EA Sports conference, but have them back-to-back. If people want to see both, they just stay tuned in; if people want one or the other, then they know "Oh, okay. I'll come back in an hour". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had one name when I was operating without Gold.

Once I went Gold, the name I had been using was taken, so I had to change (and I did it by creating a new profile and not changing the name of the first because derp.) and it's been the same since September 25, 2007. I get the occasional impulse to change it to my current handle, but it's what I've always had, so I have a sense of nostalgia towards it.

(OTOH, starting with a new profile meant I started with a clean slate, starting from 0 and it means that I can trace back my very first achievement to the day I went Gold.) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just saw *Interstellar* (and loved it) and got to thinking that if Christopher Nolan helmed (a totally theoretical) Star Trek 4, that it would probably be frigging amazing.

If he and Jonathan co-wrote and he directed, I think it would be an amazing film, let alone a Star Trek film.

He's got the ability to do "thinking" movies (e.g., Inception, Interstellar) and can merge the thematics flawlessly with action (e.g. Batman trilogy), and Star Trek has always been, at its heart, a "thinking" series (e.g. TNG: "The Drumhead", DS9: "In the Pale Moonlight", "It's Only a Paper Moon"), but can also hybridize theme and thought with intense action (DS9: Siege of AR-558).

(He can also totally fuck with your head incredibly well, as can Star Trek (e.g. Memento, The Prestige; TNG: "Frame of Mind", "Schisms", "Eye of the Beholder", "Remember Me"))

But that's just my opinion.  What's yours? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why Episode III is my favorite of the first six movies </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-19 08:34:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Now, before you go off on me, hear me out.


Episode III is the story of how Anakin finally fell, but it's also a political thriller of a sort (as is the whole of the PT) (I'll come back to this in a minute).

The B-plot of the prequels is how the Republic, essentially, destroyed itself. The democracy of the Republic was manipulated in such a way that democracy itself provided the end of the Republic.

As we all know, Palpatine was the puppetmaster from minute one

He had the Trade Federation invade Naboo, which he used as an excuse to oust Valorum who had failed to provide a diplomatic solution. Even though he wanted to keep her on Naboo, he (whether it was spontaneous or planned, no one knows) used her presence on Coruscant, and her trust in him, to manipulate her into issuing a Vote of No Confidence against Valorum, which led to him being elected Chancellor.

Over the next ten years, he manufactured the Separatist crisis as a way to consolidate power in the office of the Chancellor, with the Senate willingly handing him more and more power as the years went on, even being allowed to serve, ultimately, five extra years as Chancellor. 

He then had Dooku hire Jango who hired Zam to attempt to assassinate Padme, who had become very strong-willed in the intervening decade, and convinced her to go into hiding, so that someone less strong-willed would take her seat, so he could manipulate that individual into granting him Emergency Powers (which included the creation of the GAR); that individual being Jar-Jar (all things considered, you could argue Jar-Jar is the one most directly responsible for the rise of the Empire).

So, basically, since (probably even before) Episode I, Palpatine has been manipulating everything and [playing a massive galactic-scale chess game ***against himself***](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit/).


Now, Episode III is the culmination of all this.

Episode III is the ultimate downfall of the grand civilization that was the Republic. After thirteen years of consolidating almost every last ounce of power into the office of the Chancellor, causing the galaxy to fight a war (with him being in command of both sides), his plan finally comes to fruition with Anakin and Order 66, finally consolidating all political power into the office of what was once the Chancellor "with thunderous applause", [to quote Padme.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1FFVWEQnSM) ^1

Episode III is my favorite (besides the fucking awesome battles. I mean, even if you loathe the movie, you have to admit, Episode III's battles were fucking sweet) because it is Palpatine's last few moves of the chess game, with every piece exactly where he wants it and needs it when the time comes to have the Sith once more rule the galaxy, and when he makes his final move to capture the "enemy" king, it all goes as perfectly as he could have hoped.

Like I said, the prequels are, underneath everything, a political thriller. One man was able to, from within, bring down a thousand-plus year old stable government in a matter of a decade. 

Looking back through an old Yahoo article about the OT and the PT, I found these:
 In [the original trilogy], Palpatine is so far removed from us we can only approach him from the perspective of a Hitler. We must always remember that Hitler didn't ascend to dictator by using tanks, but the ballot box.

 Episodes IV through VI tell a much happier story, one that is consistent with the birth of the American democracy through acts of rebellion by a ragtag group of people who held the moral high ground. Episodes I through III, by contrast, tell a much less happy story about how a democracy can come to an end -- not at the hands of foreign interlopers, but directly through the democratic process itself.

That's my piece. Take of it what you will.

1: IMHO, this is probably one of the best lines in the whole series. Not even for "classicness" (e.g. let the Wookiee win), but how it sums up the Republic being its own worst enemy and being taken down from within without anybody really knowing what is going on.


ADDENDUM: I totally meant to put this in here - Episode III also holds a very special place in my heart because it's the first movie I have ever cried at (to present). I saw it with my family and during the Jedi Purge scene, I was inconsolably bawling. I think the Order 66 sequence is one of the best sequences ever filmed. The way it's done with the music on top, the muted dialogue, the face-acting from the actors, it all came together to be one powerful, heartbreaking scene. Plus, the scene in the Jedi Temple with "Master Skywalker, there are too many of them, what are we going to do?" bzzzzzt was just so. damn. sad. It still breaks my heart every time I see it. Even writing this, I'm remembering the whole sequence in my head and it's giving me goosebumps and harshing my buzz.  The scene on Mygeeto where Ki-Adi yells "come on!" and then we go to a ground-level close-up of the clone's boots suddenly stopping, Ki-Adi turns around, fends off a few bolts, but gets taken down in a hail of gunfire. Plo Koon shot down on Cato Neimoidia by his clone wingmen, cockpit bursting into flame, him throwing himself forward, trying to protect himself, but crashing into the building. Aayla Secura looking at the sky, then being shot *in the back* by her clones. With the intermixed scenes of Yoda collapsing to the ground, holding his chest as he feels the thousands of Jedi across the galaxy being slaughtered by those they once called friends.

God. That sequence.

Of all six movies, those three minutes are the best in the entire franchise. Period. So well done. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In 2016, the US will vote in its 45th president, with a potential for a 2020 reelection. I followed this pattern for all future presidents, assuming all serve out their full four year term.

Assuming all presidents from 45 to 49 are one-term, then:

45: 2016

46: 2020

47: 2024

48: 2028

49: 2032

50: 2036


Or if all are two-term:

45: 2016/2020

46: 2024/2028

47: 2032/2036

48: 2040/2044

49: 2048/2052

50: 2056


Thus, **at some time between 2036 and 2056, the United States will elect its 50th president.** </TEXT>

My inclination is chronological order, so that the story flow is consistent, instead of seeing Tokyo Drift third, then seeing 4/5/6, which are all "prequels" to TD, and I know TD also sets up 7.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [u/fuzzylynx](http://www.reddit.com/u/fuzzylynx) indirectly gave me the idea, so thanks to them!

In the present-day, Assassins *AND* Templars are mysteriously being murdered, but both sides are denying responsibility, and both sides are inclined to believe the other, especially because several of the dead are deep undercover Templars and Assassins.

Over time, in the modern day portion of the story, it's revealed that there is a third organization (the Seth to the Templars' Cain and Assassins' Abel) dedicated to taking them both out completely because of the chaos they've caused across the centuries.

The main part of the story (the "flashback") culminates in the reveal that several major people (both famous and created for the game) are the founders of this third branch and exclusively dedicate themselves to utterly and completely wiping out the Assassins and Templars.

And, perhaps the PC, in the end, a life-long Assassin, comes to see what damage the Assassin-Templar War has done across the years and silently defects, and his allies from the game (perhaps even some Templar defectors?) join him in his new venture. But he stays in the organization in order to destroy it from the inside, as well as potentially recruit other "Seths".

	<TEXT> I was reading the [Let's take a trip to the Black City!](http://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/2rqll0/spoilersoc_lets_take_a_trip_to_the_black_city/) thread comments and came across this:

* RogueHippie: A cool tidbit is that, remember how they go on about the Black City always being equidistant from your location in the Fade? In Here Lies the Abyss [spoiler: you can actually see yourself get closer and further from it since you're physically in the Fade this time]

Since, I think it's kind of a general consensus that Hawke/Alistair survived the battle with the mega-demon (whatever it was), what if Hawke/Alistair figured out that, because they are physically in the Fade, they could *actually* go to the Black City and see what was there, and did so? And that would allow Hawke/Alistair to be a critical player in DA4, perhaps even a party member. (Imagine if HoF, Hawke and Inquisitor were all potential party members for DA4? Think how quickly you could fuck shit up. Hey. A boy can dream, can't he?)

I think that it would be an amazing final story DLC, acting as a lead in to DA4, if Rifts suddenly start reappearing around Thedas and Inquisitor   co. have to go fight off the demons and close them up again, with the final one opening in Skyhold's courtyard and, just as the Inquisitor and co. get ready to engage the demons that are about to appear, out comes Hawke/Alistair, in one of three ways: 
* 1) bloodied and dirty, but none much worse for wear and says something like "I've been to the Black City. You need to know what I found." or something equally cliched-but-dramatic. 
* 2) half-Blighted and dying, but the same cliched-but-dramatic line, with a half-Blighted Hawke/Alistair being a critical part/party member in DA4. 
* 3) fully Blighted (and perhaps resembling Corypheus?) and they are a Level 25+ Elite Boss baddie that you have to fight off. Once you "kill" them, the original Hawke/Alistair returns and says something, again, cliched-but-dramatic  about the Black City, like "The Black City. I saw it. And it was (adjective)." and then dies in the Inquisitor's arms either fearful or happy, depending on the adjective and what they saw in the Black City.

And, the Rifts, as it turns out, was partly Hawke/Alistair attempting to break back through to our side and not being 100% successful and partly trying to find a Rift to Skyhold, so they can arrive there directly.) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I know this is kind of against the general opinion, but I think H5 multiplayer is the best of the Halo MPs </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-08 22:33:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I never really had fun and could never get into playing multiplayer in Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4 MP. Partly because, even a few days after launch (after I finish campaign), I get completely overwhelmed by the other team. In a great match, I'd have maybe 5 or 6 kills and 10-12 deaths. My average though would be closer to 2-3 and 15-20, whereas in CoD, I average closer to 1.0 KDR (around 7-10 kills, minimum).

My brother and I have different MP playstyles (I'm more of a run-and-gun/soldier, while he is the sort to sneak up on you and hit you from behind with a suppressed pistol), but we both agree that Halo has our *absolute* least favorite multiplayer mode, in part because it can take a mag or more to kill an enemy player. Whereas in CoD, Battlefield and Titanfall, all it takes is a few well-placed rounds to kill.

Even taking the shields into account, it shouldn't take two magazines of AR rounds or a whole mag, mag and a half of BR ammo to take down an enemy. In H5, four well-aimed bursts from a BR takes an ememy down.

Also, I really enjoy the verticality that the jump packs allow for, creating far more hectic matches.

And the SmartLink ADS I find to be totally awesome; partly for the lore, and partly because even real world assault rifles have scopes, so why would 26th century ones not? It makes all the guns much easier to shoot.

Also, I find the Ground Pound to be a really neat game mechanic. It's actually come in handy more than once during the beta.

That's just my thoughts. Take from them what you will.

ADDENDUM: No, I didn't know that the BR was always a 4SK. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question: as an interim between DAI and DA4, what would you think of "Dragon Age: First Blight"? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-06 10:10:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Like how Arkham Origins was full-game interim between Arkham City and Arkham Knight, what about, while they are scripting, concept arting, etc. DA4 as the major release, they put a small team towards making a smaller, interim game chronicling the First Blight. Since it was almost 200 years long, it would probably play out better storywise (and be easier on the devs) to make it a conventional, linear game, though with some smaller RPG elements (streamlining DAI's weapons   upgrades system, e.g. having weapon variety based on class and play style, but only prefab upgrades for purchase) and maybe open-world camps between missions (or something like that).

Since it was 200 years, perhaps the PC is a family chain of soldiers, all of whom fought in the Blight, perhaps even being part of the team that killed Dumat (maybe ancestor/descendant was on each team)?

And, perhaps, they can include an epilogue sequence where the final PC is part of Sashamiri's team that imprisons Corypheus and, perhaps, towards the end of the game, somewhere along the way, meet a 10-or-so-year-old girl named Andraste and her family.

Considering what all revelations are made in DAI, it would be an interesting way to build on some of the teases and revelations made in DAI, without giving too much of the future game plan away.


But, that's just my thoughts. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [SPOILERS] Reading through [SPOILER's] dialogue </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-05 08:49:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was flipping through dialogue on the DA Wiki and hit Solas's page. A looot of this stuff really makes sense, or can be better put in to context, in hindsight.

* Solas: The Wardens see themselves as the world's defense against the Blight, do they not?
* Blackwall: Yes...why do you sound so skeptical? Doesn't everyone know this?
* Solas: When an Archdemon rises, they slay it. What will they do when all the Archdemons are slain? Without Archdemons, there can be no Blights, is that the reasoning?
* Blackwall: Right. Where are you going with this?
* Solas: Nowhere. I hope they are correct. 

To me, this is Solas hinting that Archdemons and Blights *can be* mutually exclusive.


* Blackwall: You spoke of seeing death and destruction. Did you fight in a war?
* Solas: There are struggles across Thedas at any given time. I doubt you would have heard of it.
* Blackwall: An Elven skirmish?
* Solas: In a manner of speaking. You?
* Blackwall: I was a soldier. And I...Well...You know how it is.
* Solas: I do indeed. 

I mean, I guess it was an Elven skirmish in a manner of speaking. The same way that the Battle of Stalingrad was just a small skirmish.


* Cassandra: Solas, if you do not mind me asking, what do you believe in?
* Solas: Cause and effect. Wisdom as its own reward, and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist
* Cassandra: That is not what I meant
* Solas: I know. I believe the elven gods existed, as did the old gods of Tevinter. But I do not think any of them were gods, unless you expand the definition of the word to the point of absurdity. I appreciate the idea of your Maker, a god that does not need to prove his power. I wish more such gods felt the same.
* Cassandra: You have seen much sadness in your journeys, Solas. Following the Maker might offer some hope.
* Solas: I have people, Seeker. The greatest triumphs and tragedies this world has known can all be traced to people. 

His line "...and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist" makes me think that the Elven gods had become power-mad and, etc., which is why he rebelled (see: Fen'harel as God of Rebellion) against them. And him saying that the Elven gods were not gods "unless you expand the definition...to the point of absurdity" makes me think that they were just super-powerful mages or something of that sort - sort of a pseudo-corollary to Clarke's Third Law ("Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"), that any being with sufficiently powerful magical strength is indistinguishable from a god.


* Cole: You don't need to envy me, Solas. You can find happiness in your own way.
* Solas: I apologize for disturbing you, Cole. I am not a spirit, and sometimes it is hard to remember such simple truths.
* Cole: They are not gone so long as you remember them.
* Solas: I know.
* Cole: But you could let them go.
* Solas: I know that as well.
* Cole: You didn't do it to be right. You did it to save them.
* Inquisitor: Solas, what is Cole talking about?
* Solas: A mistake. One of many made by a much younger elf who was certain he knew everything.
* Cole: You weren't wrong, though. 
* Solas: Thank you, Cole. 

The "they" the Cole refers to are undoubtedly his friends of the Elven pantheon. He's tormented by the fact that he had to lock them away. Though, Cole comforts him in that his friends, as he remembers them, are always with him and that he could, if he wished, forget all about them and move on with his life. Cole then says that Solas "did it to save them", probably meaning the ancient Elves, ending with Cole reassuring Solas that locking away the pantheon was the right thing to do.




Anyhoo, that's my two cents. Do with it what you will. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> *IF* Spider-Man gets handed back to Marvel, this is what I would make his origin </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-14 08:04:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It would be the traditional Spider-Man origin, but with an MCU twist.

Basically, Uncle Ben was in Manhattan during the Battle of New York and was shot and killed by a Chitauri while running to his car to try and escape. 
Long story short, after the Battle of New York, Peter saw the Avengers and decided that NY needed a neighborhood hero, not emergencies-only heroes. 

While on a class trip to a Stark Industries lab (or Oscorp - a Stark Industries subsidiary?), a lab-test spider that escaped it's enclosure drops down from the ceiling onto his shirt, causing him to freak out a bit (because who wouldn't?)
But the spider has yet to have tests performed on it, so it's just an ordinary spider.

However, the stealth and high-tensile webbing, etc. of spiders inspires his superhero alter-ego. So, he uses Stark Industries/his own personal Stark Industries-knockoff high-tech whatsits (nanobots? ultra-sticky glop? fine-point needle-like things?) on a pair of gloves and boots to give himself the wall-crawling ability and he builds his own webshooters in the same vein.

And his outfit is just a customized spandex jumpsuit.

So, he sort of becomes Kick-Ass (ordinary teenager with no real powers), but with wall-crawling abilities.

So, that's how I'd handle it. I'd very closely tie-in Spider-Man to the MCU history and use that as a catalyst for his becoming Spider-Man. Plus, it'd explain how his feet can stick to walls while climbing and never slip.

Thoughts?


ADDENDUM: As far as his strength goes, before hand, he wasn't super-scrawny, but he wasn't a jock either. But, after he decided to become Spider-Man, while he's developing his stuff, he's working out. He uses the time while working out to mentally work through the tech and design it and such. And the tech would also help make it easier for him to climb the wall, since he's got solid anchors. </TEXT>
