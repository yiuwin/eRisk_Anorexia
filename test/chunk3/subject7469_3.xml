	<TITLE> Fucking depression again </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi all,

Having a hard time again mentally and can feel the familiar tendrils of previous bouts of depression coming round again.

As the above paragraph suggests I have been here before.
16 
22

And now 27

I thought I could escape this by just changing my life. 

I have an amazing girlfriend now and live in an awesome share house with all my greatest mates.

This is very different from before as I was still living at home with mum. 

I was just annoyed today that I can be In love with my girl and just be feeling the same/extremely similar depressed feelings.

Just feeling that it is all redundant and I might as well fade away now rather than continue. 

At the same time I can see the future that I have with my girlfriend and the amazing life we can have (full boyal)
With kids and all the rest.

Anyway girls and guys I just wanted to vent in general about this fucking thing I can't escape in my head that lends a obscene numbness to my life sometimes. 

I am seeing a DR for referral later today so I can talk to someone. 

Happy thoughts from you friend
Dragonpants in wonderful fucking Australia </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So many of these 'London' points apply to sydney as well. 

It's a fucking joke how expensive it is for the housing here. I did the math and I just can't see any way I can buy in sydney.

Many of the gen y stereotypes apply because they are true I'll grant you that. But the thing is, this is our world now we are inheriting this earth and all its problems and awesomeness. 

So yeah I am going to be annoyed at a hell of a lot of people bemoaning gen y, but at the end of the day we will be increasing in control of the world.

	<TITLE> Looking for others to start a video series on aus politics. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Looking for other people who may be interested in doing a YouTube series about the current state of politics here in nsw and aussie land in general. 

I am wanting to get more young people involved in political stuff (from all sides) and was thinking that the main issue is that it is so damn boring to watch anything political. 

So, the series would provide an overview about who is saying what and what that means in general. 

It should go with out saying that tgis series will not be in any way politically correct. 

Pm me if you are interested or know someone who could be.

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My two cents.

How are you going to deal with all the laws around the world in reguards to paying for a product?  Who is responsible for refunds? How will this process be handled so that the community who may purchase to mods for the games they love don't get blindsided?

There are so many potential issues this could cause for modding and steam in general. </TEXT>
