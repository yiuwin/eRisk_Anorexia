	<TITLE> Fantasy Reader Getting Into Sci-Fi, Recommendations? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Title says it all. I've been reading a lot of fantasy for the past few years and want to take a shot at science fiction. I've read (and loved) 'A Canticle for Leibowitz', 'Rendezvous with Rama', and the half-or-so I read of 'Hyperion'. 

My English Lit. class read 'The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas' by Le Guin a couple weeks back, which was also very good. Stories with generally darker (or rather ambiguous) undertones tend to be my favourite, alongside those with good world-building and development of both character/setting. 

Any recommendations would be appreciated; thanks! 

EDIT: May as well mention that I'm a physics major, so a novel (or author's, like Arthur C. Clarke) who manage to incorporate legitimate science into their fiction is always a sweet spot haha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I couldn't find any part of the Eclipse which would fit well so spent quite a lot of hours in After Effects trying to recreate it from scratch. Guess it ended up better than I thought hahah.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The entirety of the transitions were done by me; no actual trailers were used for this video, just clips from the films themselves. Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Fate of the Branded - Berserk trailer [fanmade] </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The hype for the 2016 anime led me to make a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4WUVUaRGa0) with the Golden Age films a few months back. Also used it to get a friend who doesn't read--at all--or watch anime to at least give Berserk a shot; it worked, and now he quite likes the series (though doesn't read it). 

Anyhow, I thought some of the people here would enjoy this and might even use it to get others to start this fantastic series. Any constructive criticism is appreciated. 
On a relevant note, do you guys think this represents Berserk at least somewhat decently? I couldn't think of how to do so without obvious spoilers, and this seems ever so slightly shounen-esque.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oops, a box set. That seems unlikely given how absolutely massive the series already is, but something "Collector's Edition"-y for Berserk would be A+.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm surprised no one has mentioned this, but Monster has been getting a reprint for the past year or two, and the reprint is absolutely fantastic. On the expensive side, but beautifully done regardless. 

So yes, hopefully, when/if Berserk finishes, it'll probably happen. I hope.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Or so I'd like to think. Haven't played much with Kali to be able to quantify how impressive that is lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My first penta was about ~200 hours in with Ullr. Got super lucky because Hades ult'd most of their team and my basics (+ bladed arrow, which got the initial triple) just tore through health. Unfortunately, that was just pure luck as I didn't see 4/5 of the team when attacking. Yours on the other hand, was A+. Skill for days.  </TEXT>
