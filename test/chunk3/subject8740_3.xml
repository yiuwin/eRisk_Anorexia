	<TEXT> People don't understand that nurses are educated, autonomous professionals who work with, not under doctors. While doctors are considered leaders of the clinical team, they still rely on input from nursing staff to make treatment decisions. Doctors are immensely knowledgable about diseases processes and drugs mechanisms, where nurses know how that disease or medication is affecting a specific patient.

	<TEXT> 
It drives me nuts that people seem to think that having lab values within a normal range means that you are perfectly healthy. While healthy people will have normal lab values, you can be very unhealthy and still be within normal ranges because your body will fight very hard to stay at homeostasis. When things start coming back abnormal, that means that you have been in rough shape for a while, and your body has run out of ways to compensate for whatever you are doing to throw yourself out of whack. 

This is something that people with anorexia and FAs have in common: both incorrectly interpret normal lab values to mean that they are healthy and use this information to further justify their unhealthy behavior.

	<TEXT> I mean some of it is luck but I think a lot of what makes a good roommate relationship is what you expect from it. I think a trap that a lot of people fall into is that they either want to a.) live with a friend or b.) have a roommate that will become their best friend. 

I have only ever had positive experiences with roommates, and I plan on living with one until I move in with my boyfriend, but I think the reason this setup works for me is that I always live with people from outside of my social circle. 

I just think that it is easier; I like my roommate and we get along but we have different friends and separate social lives. I don't feel obligated to hang out with her or bring her alone when I go out and it is nice to be able to disconnect from whatever is happening in my friend group when I am at home. We do hang out together but it feels like more of a choice than it would if we were already friends; neither of us ends up feeling hurt if the other wants to be alone or spend time with other people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a nursing student, I am constantly being asked why I don't want to be a doctor, and being told that I am too smart to be "just" a nurse, usually by people who have no idea what a nurse even does. 

I don't think that people understand that I chose to pursue a career in nursing, I know that I could be a doctor and I have considered it, but I chose nursing. 

I did not choose nursing because I am too dumb to be a doctor: I am a National Merit Scholar attending on a full academic scholarship to a highly regarded public university where I am a part of the nationally known honors program, and I am not an anomaly among my classmates in the nursing program. 

I have a huge amount of respect and admiration for doctors but I refuse to see myself as inherently inferior.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a nursing major. 

I like nursing because it allows me to solve problems. I wanted to be a doctor until I job shadowed and realized that the role of a physician is to look at the big picture and create a care plan, where nurses are the ones dealing with the day to day issues and doing most of the procedures, which is what I wanted to do. For me, nursing is the perfect balance of science and skills; I get to insert the IV and push the medicine that the doctor ordered but I have to understand why the drug was ordered, what it should be doing and what contingencies I should be prepared for based on the mechanisms involved and the patients history.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am against laws that punish mothers for substance use during pregnancy because it is much more of a health issue than a legal issue, and penalizing people won't solve any problems. These laws could discourage pregnant women with substance abuse problems from seeking proper medical care, which puts them and their child in even more danger. The symptoms of withdrawl can be even more dangerous to a fetus than controlled drug use, so the current standard of care for addicted women is methadone treatment to slowly wean them off of drugs. Even if a woman commits to getting clean the second that she finds out she is pregnant and does everything right her child could still be born with NAS because of the methadone in her system.

Honestly, it bothers me that women choose to drink while they are pregnant because it is a risky behavior with no possible upsides. While I know that the risks from consuming small amounts of alcohol are pretty negligible, I just can't understand why someone would be willing to take chances for something that is completely optional?

I know that a pregnant woman's body is still very much her body, but I believe that the choice to carry a pregnancy to term comes with a responsibility for the wellbeing of the fetus that you are sharing your body with. </TEXT>

As a nursing major who works as a camp counselor for the summers, I hold 2 positions that require me to pass annual background checks. Even though the screenings are performed by the same company and I have never had any issue come up, I am required to have separate screenings for school and work, which is a pain in the butt. I know that I am not a danger to the kids or to patients; most people aren't but I am willing to put up with this minor inconvenience if it means that vulnerable populations are protected.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My my upper jaw is too small so I have an underbite. 

I had my bite fixed twice with braces and corrective headgear as a kid, but my lower jaw grew a little bit when I was in high school and now my jaw is out of line again. 
I've been told that it isn't really noticeable to other people unless I point it out, but I feel like it messes up my profile and makes me look really mannish (like American Dad). 
I also can't really chew effectively because my molars don't match up so I have to jut out my lower jaw when I eat. 

Since I'm an adult, the only way to fix my bite is getting a surgery where they break and reset my facial bones. This isn't really an option for me because I'm a full time college student so I don't have the time, and I'm underweight and recovering from anorexia so having my jaw wired shut probably isn't the best idea.

	<TEXT> For me surrogacy is such a messy issue. 
I can be ok with it if all there is an existing relationship between the parties; if a couple has a close friend or relative volunteer to carry their baby I think they should be allowed to do that, but I can't get behind surrogate arrangements where the person carrying the baby is an unrelated third party. In addition to the legal issues that surrogacy can bring up I see it as a huge ethical issue as it is based on the exploitation of poor, often uneducated women.  </TEXT>

I'm also in favor of having a waiting period to purchase a gun; a gun should not be a spur of the moment purchase, and I can't think of a single good reason that a person would need a gun right away.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally have pretty conservative views, but I am a liberal voter because I believe that people should be free to make their own choices, and I am not arrogant enough to think that the way I choose to live my life is the way everyone should live. 

I am personally against abortion, but I vote pro-choice because I understand that we don't live in a world where banning abortion is a realistic goal. As someone from a relatively privileged background, I know that I will never fully understand what can drive a woman to make the decision to terminate a pregnancy. I also understand that sadly, we live in a world where many women may see abortion as their only option as the very same people who push to stop abortion seem to stop caring about the sanctity of life once a baby exits the birth canal. 
Banning abortion won't do anything but further burden marginalized women; to prevent abortions we need to create a system that better helps women prevent unwanted pregnancies, and provides proper support to those who become pregnant whether they want to keep the child or give it up.

I'm biracial but I clearly got my hair from the black side of my family.

All of my older female relatives think that it is the cutest thing ever and just want to touch it all of the time, my grandmother always talks about how she wish she was young and could pull off a look like mine! 
I think the worst reactions I get are from people I see regularly in passing who assume that I lost my hair and excitedly remark about how fast it is growing "back" when they see me.

	<TEXT> Studies have shown that even in kids diagnosed with ADHD, taking meds doesn't consistently improve their performance compared to nonmedicated peers, because while the medication may give them more of a capacity to focus, it won't make topics that they need to focus any more interesting. It can lead to being "productively unproductive" which when your improved focus is directed at something other than what you need to be doing; so if you didn't want to study before, taking Adderall won't make you, it will just make you even more focussed on Netflix (or whatever). Even if you focus on what you need to study there is really no evidence that you will retain information any better. 

It bothers me personally because I have ADHD and truly need meds to function at a normal level, and people abusing them makes it a major pain in the butt for me to get a medication that has been legally prescribed to me for close to 10 years. Some of my annoyance is petty resentment that I have to take these meds to function but other people can take them for fun or to get even more of an advantage; I don't even tell people that I have ADHD because I've had people find out and try to get me to sell them my meds; which is just so fucking entitled and obnoxious on so many levels.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> High school gym class because it was truly pointless. There were plenty of classes that I disliked, but they at least  served some educational purpose, where I can honestly say that I did not learn a single thing in my 4 years of gym class.

 I personally love exercise but I fail to see the function of gym class beyond elementary school when kids are developing gross motor skills and learning how to cooperate etc. 

I just don't see the point in trying to make kids exercise; the kids who like working out will do it on their own time and the kids that aren't into it won't learn to love it in gym class. I never broke a sweat in class because I thought it was gross to sweat then put my clothes back on, and unless you were trying way too hard nothing we really did was that strenuous. 

If we want to teach kids healthy habits give them the tools and information they need in health class and offer gym as an elective for those that truly want guidance, requiring gym is at best a waste of time and at worst may make kids who need to develop healthy resent and dislike exercise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When my mom was in her late 20s (before I was born) she decided to quit her stable job and go to law school. A lot of people tried to talk her out of it, saying she's too old to go back to being a full time student and that by the time she graduates she will be over 30 (the horror!)

My moms response was that she will be over 30 in 3 years no matter what, but she wanted to be over 30 and a lawyer.

I just really like her perspective that it is never too late to make yourself happy, and her willingness to make changes in her life. I am prone to getting set on what I "should" be doing and I tend to prioritize certainty over what will make me happy, so I really admire my mom for her ability to change her mind about things.  </TEXT>

My SOs mom is super busy (she's a practicing physician and the head of her department in a large hospital system) so it would mean a lot that she is willing to spend some of her limited free time with me. She has always been really supportive of me going into healthcare (I'm currently finishing up my freshman year of college as a nursing major) and I would love to have her as a mentor.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, here is the thing about blood work: human bodies REALLY like homeostasis. Obviously some labs like cholesterol allow for more of a range, but for the most part, if something is abnormal you are not doing so hot. Our bodies have a lot of (super cool and interesting) mechanisms and contingency plans built in to keep our lab values in a normal range because that is what we need to survive. So, by the time your labs come back abnormal, you are already in bad shape; you have been doing things that disrupt whatever homeostasis that whatever ways your body tries to regulate itself have finally failed. I see this on the other end of the spectrum in people with eating disorders claiming that if their labs are normal they still aren't "sick", when in fact, blood levels are usually the last thing to go wonky and them doing so is a sign that things are starting to shutting down and you need to be in a hospital bed like, last week.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been really struggling with my eating disorder, so I'm really feeling the rage about FAs claiming to have anorexia as if it is some kind of accomplishment. I have worked so hard and made so much progress, but my eating disorder is threatening to take everything away and it is terrifying. First of all, it perpetuates the completely wrongheaded idea that anorexia is the "best" or "most serious" eating disorder. It breaks my heart that my friends struggling with EDNOS/OSFED/whatever we are calling it this week, BED and bulimia are made to feel like they are less sick or "deserving" of help because they aren't anorexic. We all have the same disease, it will just end up killing us in different ways. 
On a more personal note: ANOREXIA FUCKING SUCKS. I have struggled with it since 5th grade (ish) and I have missed out on so much by either being sick or being in treatment. It isn't something you control or just choose to have as FAs love to claim.  I worked so hard to get healthy enough to go away to college and was doing great I ended up losing 10 pounds after having my wisdom teeth removed over winter break. I ended up spending my first week of the spring semester in the hospital because my body freaked the fuck out. Right now I am not allowed to do any exercise, I take medications 3 times a day and I have to go to the pediatric hospital every week to see my doctor and get labs drawn. I hate that I am back to being such a massive emotional and financial burden on my parents and as much as I know they would do anything for me I am don't think I could bring myself to tell them that I need to go back to inpatient or residential treatment. The crazy thing is, despite this, I still have trouble believing that I am sick and that I need to gain weight. I am the happiest I have ever been in school, I have friends for the first time and I love what I'm studying and I could end up losing EVERYTHING because I'm fucking anorexic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In eating disorder treatment, we were taught that it can be super helpful to identify and work through triggers in therapy, but it really isn't the best word to use in the "real world", because it has become a way for people to shut down any conversation that makes them feel a little bit uncomfortable. Instead of just saying "I'm triggered" and completely ending a dialogue, we were always encouraged to get out of the situation if we just couldn't handle it, or explain that whatever a person is saying/doing is making you uncomfortable and ask to change the topic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm totally not defending your father, I clearly don't know the whole situation, but depending on how old you were when this happened probably fine not taking you to the ER; little kids tend to spike really high fevers, and unless they are acting super sick, showing other alarming symptoms or not responding to treatments most doctors will tell parents not to worry and to just make a sick appointment for the next day, or to go to the ER if it doesn't go down within a set period of time. Honestly, I would be much more concerned about a kid with a much lower fever who was acting lethargic or not eating than a kid with a scary high fever that was engaged and easily roused from sleep. 

Dunking you in cold water wasn't the best idea as that can put your body into shock, but since you had a high fever there is a chance that it felt much colder than it really was.  </TEXT>

I am so happy with where my life is headed and I have worked so hard to be in the place that I am right now but my eating disorder is threatening to take that away from me. I have been diagnosed for about 8 years and I feel like if I don't get better soon, it will be too late if it isn't already.

	<TEXT> I'm doing ok. I'm having a rough day in terms of eating (I have been staring at my lunch for the last 30 minutes) but I am in a pretty good mood because the sun came out this morning after a miserable, rainy day, and I found out that I got an interview for the summer job that I am hoping to get. I'm getting weighed on Thursday, and I know that my weight needs to have stayed stable so I can get back to exercising (or at least not be told that I will drop dead if I do) but it is so hard to eat the amount I know that I need to for so many reasons. 

This morning I had anatomy and physiology lecture, which I enjoyed and this afternoon I have ballet. I'm not actually allowed to dance (or do any exercise for that matter), which is very hard for me and I'm worried about how I will feel sitting out and observing, and what I will say if people ask why I'm not dancing. After that I'll probably procrastinate, then attempt to study for my statistics exam tomorrow (I should be worried but I just can't make myself care because at this point the worst I could get in the class is a B). I also need to do some laundry because I am out of clothes that I actually like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a lightweight, I like to consider myself a bit of an expert on hangovers since the difference between "pleasantly buzzed on a weeknight" and "white girl wasted" is about 1 glass of wine for me. 

I wait about half an hour after waking up to try ingesting anything; if I'm going to throw up it will be within 30  but after that I'm usually in the clear. While I'm waiting I brush my teeth and take a shower because it usually makes me feel better (physically, and about my life) and it can't really make anything worse. 

After that I eat dry Honey Nut Cheerios and take little sips of water until I feel confident that things are going to stay down. Then I take 2-4 Advil and drink a bottle of Gatorade and keep eating cheerios until I have had a full serving or get bored, then I get a smoothie. 

For the rest of the day, I make an effort to move around, get outside and eat a lot of vegetables. I tend to end up drinking super sweet stuff since I can't drink beer so I usually avoid sugar for a day or 2. 

The best hangover cure is being super hydrated before you drink, and, according to my roommate eating a bowl of cereal before you pass out.  </TEXT>

We have no idea why it started, apparently when I was 18 months old my mom took me to a farm and when I saw the chickens and lost my freaking mind. 

I think the coping skills I've learned for other things have helped me deal with my bird issues, I no longer have bird related panic attacks and I think that is because my general anxiety is better managed, so I'm just less prone to freaking out. 

I still scroll by very fast if there is a picture of a bird somewhere haha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a parent, but your daughter sounds just like me when I was her age and I hope that I can be helpful. 
As a former depressed middle schooler, I would recommend getting her into therapy. 11 is a rough time, even kids who don't end up with a lifelong mental health diagnosis can really benefit from some extra support at this time of their life. A therapist can let you know when you really need to be worried, and help you and your daughter have an open and honest dialogue about what you can do to help her. I also think it is helpful to introduce her to the idea of therapy, and show her that it is nothing to be ashamed of so that she can feel comfortable seeking it on her own in the future if she has to. 

I think its also important to remember that kids at this age have no perspective. They are experiencing these strong "adult" emotions for the first time, and to them it is the worst thing ever, and they have absolutely no life experiences to remind them that things can and will get better. 

Its also important for you to remember that things will get better. I really struggled when I was around your daughters age; I self harmed, ended up in a psychiatric hospital at 13 following a suicide attempt and still struggle with anorexia. I'm now in college on a full academic scholarship, in a healthy relationship with an amazing guy and a pretty darn happy and functional adult. I still take medication to manage my depression and anxiety and see a therapist and medical doctor for my eating disorder but I have the skills and support to cope with life. As much as those years sucked, I grateful for the resiliance that I gained from my struggles. 
You have my sympathy, though I am not a parent, I know how hard my struggles were on my parents.

	<TEXT> This post is a mess and it makes me so angry, as someone struggling with anorexia, and as someone with friends of all shapes and sizes struggling with eating disorders. This post feeds into the wrongheaded idea that anorexia is the "holy grail" of eating disorders, and really invalidates the struggles of people fighting any of the other, equally damaging and life threatening eating disorders. There are larger people that struggle with restrictive eating behaviors, either on its own, or as one of many symptoms; but they are not anorexic, and it would be unfair to give them that diagnosis because they need different treatment that what is indicated for anorexia nervosa. This does not mean that they are any less sick or deserving of help and compassion, it just means that their illness is different.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Musical theatre, both as a fan and a performer. 

Until about halfway through my junior year of high school, I was planning on getting a BFA in musical theatre (I even had college audition coaches) but then I realized that a.) I love school and science and unlike theatre I can't get good instruction of that nature outside of a university and b.) I can decide to pursue a career as a performer without a degree (there are many successful people without degrees, and many unsuccessful people without them) but its like, super illegal to be a nurse without a degree. Now I'm a nursing major and the most experience my friends have with theatre is seeing the national tour of Wicked when they were 14. </TEXT>
