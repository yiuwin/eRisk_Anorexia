	<TEXT> 3 games, 9 points and 3 clean sheets. I'd say that's a massive confidence boost! Hopefully this is the strong finish we have for the season so we can crack on with a promotion push next season.

Also leap frogging Birmingham Shitty is also a bonus!

	<TEXT> I never knew how good sex could be till I met my current fiance!

I was in an emotionally abusive relationship previously and meeting her has been a complete breath of fresh air. Just to be compatible with someone on every front imaginable makes everything so much better.

I'd love to pick just one but I have so many. Absolutely wonderful woman I am privileged and lucky to be with! </TEXT>
