	<TEXT> The hard part is getting people to give you the chance. If you don't have the educational merits then you really have to prove you can get the work done to a good standard. I was very fortunate to have been a founder for a successful company at home which I think is what got me in the door for most of my interviews moving here.

If you can show you can do the work required, why wouldn't they hire you? I say this however I've only worked with small agile teams in my career and I'm sure a more corporate environment would be different. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no formal training, but I've been working commercially for agencies and development houses for almost 7 years now. Well proven would be a combination of good references, code samples   work experience. 

Cost of living can vary, you can get a room in a flat (sharing with 3-4 other people) not far from the center of town for 550 p/month including bills. However you can easily spend 2,000 p/month to live in a nice house   area. Food is probably the cheapest thing (compared to New Zealand where I came from) and rent is the heavy hitter.

If you can get a 35k+ salary you can live very comfortably here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A higher resolution isn't going to show you more, the camera renders what it renders (and subsequently what your game can screen capture) not based on resolution but on the FoV and plane size. I think you're perhaps approaching this the wrong way. I would make a camera that shows a bigger area  using the built in camera settings then activate and capture from that camera for your screenshot. </TEXT>

or in c#

    public ClassName myscript;

where if the script you're adding is called PlayerController it would look like

    public PlayerController myscript.

http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/272755/multidimentional-array-for-inventory-style-system.html

I would also try to only check these blocks only when you know a change has been made to them, E.G. adding a block should trigger the blocks around it to check only once. obviously this is situational to your game and what it's doing :)

Best of luck </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would look at keeping an array, list or whatever you like of your objects. You may already be doing this to Instantiate them at positions, I'm not sure. Overlap sphere isn't that intense in terms of overhead...Unless you're checking this type of thing in update()

You can then easily just check the array if there's a block registered at that position.

It's very situational though. I would take time to try out both methods, if time is on your side :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Quick question about USA esta for VWP. Maybe wrong subreddit. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-05-29 12:16:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello! First off apologies if this is in the wrong section.

I traveled to the USA in November last year under the visa waiver program and all I had to do was submit an esta and pay the $14 fee.

These esta documents are valid for 2 years and there is some information you can update such as your arrival flight info and address while in the USA.

Ive updated this information as I'm now living in London and traveling back to the USA. However there is one field on my esta that I cannot update which is "Country you live in".

I'm currently on a work visa in the UK and everything on my esta now says I'll be flying in from London but because I cannot update this "Country you live in" field (which still says new zealand) I fear I might get bounced since I've technically been living in the UK for the last 7 months.

It's only $14, so I have no problem submitting a new esta with all correct info, but if someone with some knowledge on the matter can let me know that would be great!

again, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit.

cheers </TEXT>

Looking at using this to build a small web app. App itself will be mainly interacting with the database at a client level via an admin panel and a front end which basically spits all this data out.

I've used laravel before but it just seems too big for such a small project.

Any thoughts? Alternatives?

Cheers </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well first off, typical programmers are not on 6 figure salaries like you say. A good chunk (and i'd argue a majority) of unity users are simply making games for a hobby and no matter how much time something saves $350 is just not possible.

I never said it wasn't worth what they are charging either. I've just had a play with the trial and I'd say this asset is worth $350 and I'd buy it if I could afford it. </TEXT>
