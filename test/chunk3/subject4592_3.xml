	<TEXT> Sure mud and blood gives you the tank perspective, but the infantry attack is too darn iconic to have been missed.  
I would have loved to get a first person infantry perspective of one of those attacks.  
You could have it sort of like the first story, whenever the machine guns/mines kill you, you change perspective to another random doughboy 6 feet to your left.  
This would give you something most of the campaign is missing: a sense of scale. 90% of the time you feel like you are the only soldier in this entire damn war, it's a relative rarity to see an NPC fighting alongside you.
Maybe it'll be the center piece for a story DLC, I'd pay good money for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just think, if she can get that much shit done, silence that many opponents, kill that many people while only using the resources available to a First Lady/ Senator/ Secretary of State without getting a single conviction. She must be the single most effective operator in history. Exactly the kind of person you want waging a secret war on America's enemies.    
  
I just have this image in my head:    
  
Hillary sits in a darkened room lit only by the glare of screens.  
  
On one screen she glances at the reports of North Koreas current dissolution. China is in full panic mode due to the stream of refugees. There is a 83.2% chance that Kim Jong Un is already dead, but he was never a particularly important part of the equation. It was a rather easy operation, there had been a 77.3% chance it would have collapsed on its own anyway. South Korea is making territorial gains 2.3% ahead of projections; this may be problematic, but is well within acceptable bounds.  
  
On another she monitors Iran unrest, a suspiciously well informed and funded liberal democratic revolt is ongoing. All key indicators show an 80% chance the current regime will fall within the next 197 hours. The agents in key points on social media and on the ground report a 88.4% chance the new regime will be favorable enough to meet current goals. They shall have to be disciplined later, but in the meantime more funding shall be allocated.  
  
On a third monitors she looks at the data coming from Russia. Putin is in the midst of yet another series of purges. It amuses her how ineffective Putin has been at actually rooting out her agents in his court. The purges are doing far more damage than the agents ever would, Key performance indicators show a 93.3% chance of a regime change without any further intervention.    
  
She turns her chair to face the bankers kneeling before her.    
  
Arise! she speaks.    
  
Glory to you Madam Pyramidion!  I report that our cabal has successfully insulated the US economy from Chinas current woes, we are at your command    
  
Yes, and it pleases me to see that your reports are corroborated by my agents, it would be a shame if I were to have to unleash Sanders or Warren again. Now I have here my economic targets for the next fiscal quarter, see to it personally. You are permitted to leave now.     
  
She turns as the bankers quietly shuffle out of the room.    
  
A quick glance at the live feed coming from the cameras she had secretly installed in Bills eyeballs showed that nothing scandalous was currently occurring.  
  
And with that Hillary permits herself the indulgence of a brief but genuine smile.

	<TEXT> It seems that everything related to the seamoth results in massive slowdowns.  
The game runs fine when swimming around with the sea glider or using the cyclops/PRAWN, but the moment I enter the seamoth I'm down to 1 frame per second.  
It's not like I'm moving or anything it just freezes up.  
If I save inside a seamoth it takes 5-10 minutes to load, otherwise it takes 20 seconds, a minute tops.

My question is, do black holes always move you closer to the center?  
If not, do they lead you closer to the center enough to be worth it?  
Or am I better just using my regular drive?   

Also subquestion: I'm running with drive upgrades does the path waypoint thing always lead you as far as you can go or should i just use the free exploration system? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So "Avoid" has been removed, it obviously wasn't working as intended and hurting players through no fault of their own.   
Fair enough, good on blizzard.  
However it would still be nice to have some of the functionality.  
Everyone has run into players they just plain don't like.  
  
So what if the "Avoid" function was replaced with the "Avoid Being On The Same Team" function.   
I don't particularly care if that toxic a-hole is on the other team. I have the block button and I get to repeatedly shoot him, while he gets to drag down the other team.   
  
You would have to be mad to click "Avoid Being On The Same Team" on that top ranked Widowmaker who has repeatedly killed you. That just means that you don't ever get to be on the same team as him.   
   
I feel everyone wins, except for the a-holes.

	<TEXT> Seriously, it's utterly unbeatable in this game.  
At all levels of play it is completely OP  
10 times out of 10, good teamwork will win the game.  
The only way to beat good teamwork is by using good teamwork yourself.  
  
Just look at the pro/competition level play, every single team uses good teamwork.  
  
This is inexcusable situation in the meta and needs to be corrected. </TEXT>

Nobody to see your embarrassing failures as you get the hang of the class/map.  
Sure the bots are dumb as hell, but at least you get the opportunity to shoot them, as opposed to Vs AI where they get wiped out as soon as they spawn.  
Beats the hell out of the Practice Range. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-05-29 15:14:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Been getting a string of 200+ms pings recently.  
It was around 60 for most of the week.   

I've used netlimiter to see that I'm getting connected to an AWS server in Sydney, so I'm definitely not getting to US servers.  
Also know that nothing on my network is using enough bandwidth to cause  this much lag.   

So I've narrowed it down to Optus being dumb or Blizzard's servers wigging out.  
Anyone else getting that kind of lag? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got two legendary skins, one for [Soldier 76](http://overwatch.wikia.com/wiki/File:Soldier76_stuntrider76.jpg) and one for [Tracer](http://overwatch.wikia.com/wiki/File:Tracer_macht.jpg)
I rarely play those characters and I think they look hideous.  
The Soldier 76 skin makes him look like someone who has a frequent customer card at a head injury clinic, and the Tracer one looks like a slimmer female version of him.   
  
So wouldn't it be great if I could grind those skins into credits?  
Perhaps 1/5 of the purchase price, like the reward for a duplicate.
Should help me get the stuff I actually want to use faster.  
It's not like Blizzard hasn't done this before, Hearthstone allows you to grind cards you don't want and enchant. So why not do that here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 
I'm in Australia, some times I got connected to a US server and got 200+ pings.
Now I'm not going to have much fun. The team is going to suffer because one person is more or less unable to aim. So wouldn't it be better for everyone if I could leave without penalty? 
So what if I could call a vote? If 3 other teammates support me I get to leave without penalty.

THIS IS NOT VOTE KICK. THE ONLY PERSON YOU CAN CALL THIS ON IS YOURSELF.

If you fail you have to wait two minutes to try again. If you fail and leave/go AFK you still get penalised. 

I'm not seeing much of a downside to this. The only way to game it is to play badly if you fail, which the people would do anyway with the current system. </TEXT>
