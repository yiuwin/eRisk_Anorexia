	<TEXT> I only have the option to play the episodes in English or Japanese TrueHD, which may be the problem right there. The box doesn't mention surround sound either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually like the idea of making a slice-of-life experience out to be an RPG.

Maybe you set up your academic success or self-confidence as your HP, which is obviously at risk once your bully activates an "encounter." You could use real-world coping strategies or "summon" an authority figure to combat the bully.

Okay that sounds way cheesy, but I'm just spitballing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you make a good point. I don't think VR is the book-killer by any stretch.

But I also see VR borrowing from the strengths of novels, possibly even more so than your average video game.

An immersion experience in VR could utilize audio narration to get inside the character's head as it were, in addition to the choose-your-own-adventure style options that TellTale Games have built their recent success on. 

Heck, even a novel within the game that becomes a living picture book as you turn the pages would be an astonishing use of the technology. I'm imagining children exploring the Hundred Acre Wood between chapters of Winnie the Pooh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hadn't even considered AR. It's is just too clunky right now in my opinion.

I'm curious why you think it would eclipse VR though. Surely VR presents more opportunities to fool the senses at least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole "Empathy Simulator" label is one I thought the market or the community would potentially come up with, just like "walking simulators" kind of neatly describe minimalist story-driven first-person adventure games. But yeah, they could easily be seen as "Educational" or "Propoganda" type games, which aren't exactly endearing terms.

Your second point was my thinking as well. Gone Home seemed like it was specifically created to put you in the role of that girl's sister and learn about what she's gone through. There was literally no deviation from that plot, and yet it was very successful.

So as long as they were done well, I think there's a decent possibility of them catching on. </TEXT>
