	<TEXT> "During the investigation, Mr. Comey said, the F.B.I. recovered additional work-related emails that Mrs. Clintons lawyers had not turned over to the State Department, including some that contained classified information. But he said there was no evidence that she or her lawyers had intentionally deleted or withheld them ."

If they didn't give them the emails in the first place isn't that intentionally withholding the emails? 

"The Justice Department is highly likely to accept the F.B.I.s instruction. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Friday thatshe would acceptthe recommendation of the F.B.I. and career prosecutors in the case, after questions were raised about an impromptumeeting between her and former President Bill Clintonat an airport in Phoenix."

That isn't suspect at all is it? 

The investigation found that she received and sent "top secret" information over an unsecured email. I work for the government and they have us do cyber security, information act, and ppa  training twice a year. They are serious about this shit. It is grounds for dismissal, getting your classification downgraded, or even prison time depending on the content. Now this lady is running for president.

	<TEXT> It was in the summer of my sixteenth year around our sun. I had been flirting with a young woman at the bank window for a week and thought everything was going good till she gave me a fucking dog treat one day with my money. It was one of those hard bone shaped biscuits. Discouraged and slightly upset, I was driving home and thew the dog treat or the window going about thirty miles an hour. When I threw it out I heard a loud smack sound and someone yell. I hit a guy on a bicycle in the head with it. I know I hit him in the head cause I looked out the rear view mirror and seen him with his hand over his forehead. I just laughed and called him a douche and kept on driving. That's when I knew I was an asshole.  </TEXT>

That it feels pain, had dreams, cries, eats, breathes, urinate and deficates. That it can be scared and happy. That it can react to what is going on with its mother? Do you realize it is alive and should have the right to live just like the person carrying it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We aren't wrong. It's wrong to kill innocent children cause ladies can't keep themselves properly protected from getting pregnant. They are the only ones that can give birth in our species and have to be smarter when it comes to sex. It's illegal to kill a human after its born but not while it's in the womb. The child in the womb can feel pain, can think, has emotions, and is a living cognitive human being, but it's ok to kill it. Do you not see how fucked up that is?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand the morning after pill but when the person inside of you has a heart beat then you are literally killing a helpless person that never did you any wrong. When you ladies say it is my body and I have the right to decide what to do with my body then the same applies to everyone. That life in you has rights to. I bet it doesn't want to be murdered. The truth about this is that ladies you are the only gender in our species that can give birth. You all need to better protect yourselves from getting pregnant and if you don't and you murder another human than there should be serious legal consequences with those actions. It's crazy that it's ok to kill a human still in the womb but it's illegal to kill other humans. That's just sick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate the fact that your family can't accept your sexual preferences cause of their biblical beliefs. Let me tell you that not all Christian people are like your family. Most people forget, especially Christians, that man made those rules not God. God gave the ten commandments and Jesus taught while he was alive. Jesus spoke of understanding and acceptance, love and sacrifice. He hung out with murders and a prostitute. Even Jesus got mad and wrecked some stuff. It's sad that people like to cherry pick stuff and not follow the actual lineage in the Bible. When Jesus was alive he lived the life of a mortal human to show his father that life as a human is hard and full of distractions. He died and allowed us to be easily forgiven. His death got rid of all those hateful things man said was God's will. I'm a Christian and have no issue with gays or tranies or any one really other than the radicals that just hate and breed hate. If all you do is hate and harbor hate then all you can give is hate and the world doesn't need that anymore.  </TEXT>

I'm not saying she did this to herself or that he being passed out was an ok to fuck her, but if she wasn't passed out cause of her drinking to fast then this probably wouldn't have happen.

	<TEXT> It's weird that everyone says this girl is traumatized for life. I keep reading she was passed out drunk and he was caught in the act of trying to rape her. Was she still passed out when he took off running? Did someone have to wake her drunk ass up? If the answer is yes to those questions then she knew nothing of what happen and only found out cause she was told. How traumatic of an experience could that have been? She wouldn't have even known what it really felt like to be raped and fighting back to not be raped, knowing that no matter what you do this is gonna happen and there is nothing you can do to stop it. Being told your drunk ass was raped isn't no where as bad as  being conscience through it.  </TEXT>

I don't get it. He did this when he was not a part of that organization so why would their rules apply to him right now. I could understand if he did it when he was apart of their organization. They are banning him because he did something wrong and it hit the media hard and made so many waves. I  bet there is people in that organization that have bad rap sheets.  </TEXT>
