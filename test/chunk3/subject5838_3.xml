	<TEXT> Hey all, I see these updates time to time and I finally have something unique to contribute!  I started my own business in Illinois a few years ago.  After moving here, I had to file with the state and get all the paperwork done as a "foreign entity," blah blah blah.  Point of the matter is, I was on the phone with the secretary of state for FIVE MINUTES and got everything done, printed, and verified.  No headache, the rep in the office was incredibly friendly and made the whole process easy as pie.  Honestly, I love everything about living in this place.

Additionally, if anyone has questions about setting up their own biz, shoot me a PM and I'd be happy to help either over Reddit or in person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure about local food, but when I send something from here, I try to have it be something made by a local artist, such a print, jewelry, or other artsy good.  I've also gifted jam from [Lucile's](http://www.luciles.com/store?page=shop.browse category_id=4) through the mail.  (Picked it up in the restaurant   wrapped/shipped myself.)  Best of luck to you!

Also, if you want to send him any decals from [here](http://www.ragepaints.etsy.com), let me know and I'll send them for free with a note from you.  Props to you for being a good friend. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-05-23 20:21:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all, followup to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1dw5pt/anyone_interested_in_an_arrested_development/):

We will be planning to start the streaming at noon or very shortly thereafter.  Yeah, we'll have to WAIT until then, if we can manage it.  Depending on how many people there are, we can provide X amount of burgers and things to munch on during the day.  Feel free to bring booze if you like, we're green-friendly as well.

I was asked about the kind of viewing we'll be doing.  As in, wouldn't it be better to sit at home and appreciate every second of glory without any outside interruptions?  I plan to watch it with minimal talking, we can socialize after/in between episodes.  We're here to watch AD. Not make friends.  Okay, a little bit of making friends.  But seriously.

I might show my face at Wynkoop tonight, in case anyone thinks I'm a creeper.  I'm the tall chick with wavy-ish brown hair.  Anyone who knows me, if you'd like to leave comments saying I'm *somewhat* normal, that'd be great.

Hopefully see a handful of you on Sunday! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me me me!  Well, I'm halfway to my goal, 10 more to go and that would be an absolutely ideal weight for me.  I've lost 10 over the course of the last maybe 6-8 months?  I haven't really pushed it hard because I want to make gradual changes in my lifestyle, like eating better and going to the gym, and make them long-lasting.  Sure, the weight loss is more gradual, but I feel a million times better than I did last winter! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey ladies!  I'd like to suggest/host the first book club meeting for r/denverwomen.  I would like to request that those of you that can vouch for me and that I'm not a creep, please do so in the comments.

Book suggestion: Inferno by Dan Brown (Currently, there's a promo [here](http://www.amazon.com/Inferno-A-Novel/dp/B00B1VXVIU) for free download with a 30-day Audible trial)
Date: Thursday, June 27th
Time: 7pm
Location: My apt, Commerce City

We can have a discussion about plot points, characters, etc.  I'll have some apps, BYOB if you'd like to drink.  This date should be far enough in the future so we can all read it by then, right? RIGHT!?

PS- Also an update on the camping trip for this coming weekend, waiting on time of Brighton's HS graduation because *someone* has to work that day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This summer is becoming so incredibly packed--I want to plan a few dates for camping.  We'll also be doing a lot of during-the-week camping as well, for those who have weekend jobs.  I'm thinking of posting whenever I go, so long as no one minds me flooding r/denverwomen... ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey ladies, happy to see so many new subscribers!  As many of you have seen, last Friday's meetup went exceedingly well.  Shout out to [u/kimalyn](http://www.reddit.com/user/kimalyn/) for setting up the date and time.

So, now for the reason why I'm posting: CAMPING WEEKEND!  There was talk Friday night about having a redditor/redditora camping weekend.

I would like to propose the weekend of Fri 5/31- Sun 6/2, or Fri 7/5- Sun 7/7.  Or both!  My hubby and I would be happy to scout out a location - likely close to Denver for the first outing - any suggestions welcome.

Interest in those dates?  Locations?  Let's hear you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hubby and I are heading to New Mexico for the hell of heading to New Mexico this Saturday.  We have 2 (possibly 3, if you squish) seats open.  We're planning to go down, look around (probably Raton?) maybe find a trail, grab lunch, see if there's any small shops or anything to do, and head back.  It's 3 hours each way, and wanted to invite anyone who would like to come!  We're 25 and 26.  I'll be at the meetup tomorrow, so you can see for yourself that I am not a creeper, ha.  We have plans later in the evening (Saturday), so we'd be back around nightfall.  Hit me up if you're interested! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's mine!   thank you to [u/edible_midna](http://www.reddit.com/user/edible_midna) for the update info on the sub.

Hey all,
I'm Mallory. I'm 25. Been in Denver since July and still in vacation mode. Things that define my life would likely be my [entrepreneurial spirit](http://www.ragepaints.etsy.com), sending care packages for no reason, and going on drives to explore new towns. I love camping. Hiking. Still kind of in drink-too-much-smoke-too-much college mode. Career-wise, I am obsessed with marketing   statistics/market research. Also a major girly girl now and then - I love thrift shopping   am currently painting my nails. Oh and...big board game nerd here as well. Looking forward to meeting you all! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Moved to Denver last year and I run regularly.  Adapted (in this regard) after a few weeks.  Denver is only 5k off the ground, so the difference isn't that big.  I would just advise to ramp up slowly if you're doing any mountain-running, or go with someone!  Worry sets in the higher up you are.  As many other have mentioned in this thread, it's DRY!  Water water water. </TEXT>
