	<TEXT> Fabulous questions! And thanks for the welcome :) 
I think I would like to be able to have contact with/control nature or animals. I would just sit around talking with them all day :) Fictional reality is a hard one because I'm a huge nerd - haha. Either x-men, Harry potter or Dr. Who. Sorry, it's too hard to pick! I'd say my favorite snack food is really anything cheesy. (Cheez-its are killer) My favorite colors are pink and green (again, sorry - I'm indecisive) And as for authors - it depends on the genre. I love historical fiction so like jean plaidy and phileppa gregory are great but I also love adventure like Daniel Silva. I really will read almost anything you stick in my face.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I have a slight amount of spare time! I work full time at a vision center and when I'm not doing that I'm usually spending time with my boyfriend. We like to go do adventurous things. Biking is probably my personal favorite although he's more partial to climbing. I also read like crazy (the more history the better) and teach private violin lessons for some little ones. Thanks for the friendly welcome!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I'd say my favorite hobbies are reading, cycling (nothing feels better than the wind in your ears), playing the violin and going to concerts :) I am also a HUGE HUGE history buff </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm from Wisconsin and besides the obligatory "we're not all farmers" I really have to say: We are not some sort of girls gone wild 'omg you're foreign? please fuck me!' place. Both Love Actually and The Prince and Me had this basic theme and i just wtf-ed. Plus, with the amount of whales here you probably wouldn't want it to be a place like that... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is pretty pointless to post, especially since I don't have a picture or anything fun but I'm going to do it anyway - haha. I live in Wisconsin with my boyfriend who is from Freiburg, Germany. I'm so excited because in June we are travelling all around Europe for a whole month!!! (June) Tonight I am finally booking my ticket (seeing as he will already be there) and I could not be happier. Spending a whole month exploring the world with the love of my life really sounds like a dream come true.    </TEXT>
