	<TEXT> Thanks! Yeah before this I'd only been learning pop punk songs, so barely any solos. The only solos I really know right now are, Buddy Holly, Dani California, Smeels Like Teen Spirit, Beverly Hills and Atavan Halen. I also likie goofing around and making my own little solos in the Pentatonic scale, but my favourite is the traditional Japanese scale. But again, thank, I'll try and improve and post another video in a little while. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So I've been playing for about two years and I just learned this solo today. What does r/guitar think of my playing? Any constructive criticism? </TITLE>
