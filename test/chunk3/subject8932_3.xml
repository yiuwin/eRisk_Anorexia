	<TEXT> I want it to be quite a good monitor, and last for a good few years.

I mainly youtube/stream that's about it. I have my days where I just generally search online, who doesn't. But I want to buy a new one because the one I have is now broken. I think it's an LCD monitor, and when I look closely at the screen, it's quite fuzzy... I'm not sure why. When I first bought it it was amazing. I don't have the receipt so I can't exchange it.

Any help? Preferably 23inch monitor.

Budget is about 300? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm new to this competitive gaming world, and I've seen a lot of clips, and asked a lot of questions and been on here, reading a lot of threads... The teams that are elite, are:
Faze/EnvyUs/Optic. Those three are the best of the best.

How are EnvyUs so low down? Bad luck? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have there been any changes to the top 3 weapons in the game, post patch? (PS4) Has another weapon now taken the ASM1, speakeasys place as the number 1 most sought after gun? - Generally speaking.

If so, which weapons are now the elites... 

I used the MP11 Goliath yesterday, I'm not sure if I just got lucky, but boy oh boy, it was mowing people down with so much easy. </TEXT>

Just anything with rockets/grenades etc.

MDL + 2 Grenades + Dangers Close = pretty fun. Nooby, but so what. </TEXT>
