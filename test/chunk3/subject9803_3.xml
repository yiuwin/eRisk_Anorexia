	<TEXT> So this is a different print, but kinda shows the process. 
Essentially you have a sheet of Linoleum. you carve into it which creates lowered areas. after your done carving, you roll over it with a brayer (which is like a rolling pin covered in ink) because the areas you carved are below the surface, the ink doesn't get in those areas, and they remain white (or w/e color the paper is) after its inked up, you put a piece of paper on top of that, run it thru either a press, or hand rub it, and what your left with when you pull the paper off is the mirrored image of what you've carved. and an album of a old print with some process pics that should help.

	<TEXT> Yah I did a freelance gig about a month ago that I printed on colored paper, and I liked how it turned out. So I kept doing it. This one I cut up the block, inked them up seperatly then puzzle pieced them back together so I got both colors in one shot. Wasn't to bad here but the print I just finished (I'll post it in a couple days she it dries) had about 8 seperate and more complicated pieces and took forever to print because of it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks for posting these, but yah, next time imgur album them into one post. 

But that aside: in my opinion i think the most interesting pieces are the ones with the printed plexiglass though it does look like they might have been poorly printed, though i suppose that could have been intentional. 

So one thing I think would be beneficial would be to pick one of these and create a cohesive body of work. Right now, there doesn't seem to be a lot of continuity within your work, it seems more like random projects. i mean if i walked in and saw this without looking at the name cards, i don't think i would know they were done by the same person. If i were you, i would take one of these pieces, make a series based on it, and bring it to fruition. like why not have 7 hanging pieces, or 7 of the plexiglass prints, the more you work on a style/ idea of making the more "mature" it will become. and you'll begin to have a body of work, rather than 7 individual projects

also when it comes to continuity: theres only 7 pieces here, yet you have 4 different display methods (the bar bars, float mount, the plexiglass one and the tall hanging one. it makes it seem very disjointed. especially with your pieces being quite different, a consistent display technique could have made this display seem more together </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know about the best in the biz, but i've been using the stock Speedball Lino Cutter for like 3-4 years. they're cheap (so if your have a habit of misplacing things like me, its not a big deal/ you can get a couple of them so you don't have to switch out tips between carving tips), they're portable (just throw all the tips inside the tool for transport), you don't really even have to sharpen them (just get a box of replacement tips for about a buck a piece).  granted, i only really use the #1 tip, but it works perfectly for what i do.

I mean first of, I personally wouldn't use a laser printer, but if you do, get a nice letter paper (for the love of god, don't just use stock white printing paper). If you don't want to order anything online, go to Joanns or Michaels or some arts/ crafts store and get some nice paper. you might have to cut it to size to run through your printer though.

	<TEXT> So next time you post these, post them in an Imgur album. So much easier for you (don't have to post 10 links) for us (we don't have to click link click back ten times) 

As for the black background, my first thought (if you want to keep working on these) would be to simply print a layer either on top or under the black. Although its black, the ink will sit on another layer of ink differently than it will sit on the raw paper. so you could add a very subtle layer/ texture that way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> nice work, the value shifts are nice, and help the foreground pop. I think that the face of the girl seems kinda off. The eyes and nose seem in line, and the mouth is slightly too far to the right. drawing aside, i think the the owl works better compositionally. although they are both fairly symetrical, the girl's face is dead center and everything feeds to that spot. the owl's beak is the center of the design, but the head is above that, with its body and "horn" hitting 2 of the spots for the "rule of thirds". also the backround seems more dynamic with the smoke/misc stuff swirling around it, rather than leading directly to it. 

that said, these are really nice, especially if these aren't modified in Ps, because those white areas are sooo clean and i look forward to seeing more of your work.  </TEXT>

Also if you wanna we relief printing shirts in action good "Drive By Black" or "TugBoat Shirt" they each do them slightly differently but it shows the process in 5-7 minutes 

Edit: that last part was for the guy you were replying to

Edit 2: also I think the hardest thing in the art world is to make a style that is "you" something that when people see it they think "oh that's _____'s work" and I think that you have that. Good job.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, so i honestly think this is the great thing about Reddit, that there a millions of people all with different interests. and there are sub reddits for everyone's interests. you like pants? join /r/pants, you like midgets who do yoga, join /r/littleyoga. Theres a community for everyone. I mean    I'm a printmaker, and even though its a much smaller sub, i'm much more active in /r/printmaking than i am in /r/art, why because its people who share my interest. so personally when i come to /r/art i come to see what i would consider.... i hesitate to use the term "high art" because thats far to exclusive, but art that is engaging/ intriguing, art that may evoke emotion, or art that pushes the boundaries of what i thought art could be, Art that is progressive, art that showcases a masterful hand of the one who made it, art that makes me smile, art thats aesthetically pleasing, art that refuses to be aesthetically pleasing but is still engaging, 

Lets add tattoos for instance, I don't think they'd belong in /r/art. Now before you grab your pitchforks, I really like tattoos, i'm subscribed to /r/tattoos, I think that the people that do them are highly skilled artists with a talent that i wish i had. Would i consider tattooers artist, yes, would i consider what they make art, yes, do i think that documentation of tats would be better suited posted in /r/tattoos rather than /r/art? yes. 

Look i'm not the am-all-be-all of what /r/art is. Thats faaaaaar to long/ convoluted of a discussion with no actual agreeable outcome. all i'm saying is there are Sub-reddits for a reason. i post in /r/printmaking because thats where the printmakers hang out. If i had an interest in manga, i'd sub to /r/manga, but i don't, so i don't. But when i come to art, i'll looking for art in more of a traditional (again not the best word, but its hard to define) sense, and if that makes me an elitist asshole, i guess i'm an elitist  asshole. </TEXT>

Besides being a drawing of mario theres nothing that your drawing of mario is bringing to the table. I've personally done some video game paintings/ prints, but I didn't feel like they were something to post in /r/art because its just fan art, nothing original.... but thats my opinion and i'm sure theres 10000000 examples that contradict my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so I perused through a couple of your photos you posted here, they look like regular photos that you just slapped a photoshop filter on (granted i could be entirely wrong) but if i saw those without any context, thats what i'd assume. I'd agree that art and science can go hand in hand, but i don't see (sorry is i'm missing something) the aspect of science within the few works that you've posted. So i haven't listened to any of these yet, but these seem like they might interest you...

http://www.npr.org/series/4111499/where-science-meets-art

Looking thru your history i pulled this quote...

Well, the story with me is that I'd actually like to start presenting some of the image processing work I do from my research in an artistic capacity. I spent a lot of time on segmentation for images from transmission electron microscopy, and so many of these algorithms that we develop just look beautiful to me. I want to share, but I'm not exactly an artist. I've been trying to be creative with these algorithms by presenting binaries of images of Michelangelo's David or whatever (basically photomanipulation). The feedback I receive with binaries is that they don't look unique. There are so many apps out there that generate binaries automatically that people aren't interested in what I'm showing them. I was just thinking some computer graphics experts might have pointers on improving my binaries, that's all.

I want to see what your talking about, some of the actual "segmentation for images from transmission electron microscopy" I think that using what seem to be stock images of iconic figures isn't doing you artisic persuit any favors, expecially since as someone unaware of these images, would simply interpret you artistic stuff as just a photo with a filter. Maybe you need to describe your process, that might help me help you.

	<TEXT> I'm no mod, so i can't give an official answer, but the guidelines state

 Do not submit work that is a sketch, a doodle or an unfinished work (unless it is a discussion looking for help on how to finish). You can post those to other subreddits like /r/IDAP, /r/sketches, /r/doodles instead.

So if you asking where to go with your piece then according to the guidelines its A-OK, it might be good if the Mods added a "Work in Progess (WIP)" flair to denote posts like that. 

Edit: so there a post like this one 

http://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/2c534e/wip_untitled_acrylic_on_panel_36x48/

IMO: its a WIP but its not like hes asking about how to finish it, hes just showing a WIP. in this scenerio why not just wait til its finished and post the progress shots then. if you just want to show people what your working on as its happening, post it on instagram.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so overall quality of post now-a-days aside: can we please get back to non Karma bait titles? If a piece is good, it'll get upvoted, if its bad, it'll get downvoted. but thats art, and what /r/art was founded on. We should be judging your work based on the work itself. not the context of the work.


-"i spend XX hours on this" Who gives a shit, unless the time spent was conceptually linked to the making of your piece, it doesn't matter

-"This is my first time using XX" Who gives a shit, If you go to the MoMA and say "hey guys this is pretty good for my first time, so you should put it in here" they'd tell you to piss off. If you don't think people will appreciate your work, without the context, then maybe your piece isn't up to par, and you should keep working until you have something that can stand on its own merit. 

-"My girlfriend made this" Who gives a shit, are you trying to brag to reddit that you have a "girlfriend" no one cares man, if you girlfriend makes good work, then submit it with her name. as in Title, Media, Name. thats it. 

-"This is a Sketch I did, LOL" Who gives a shit. A) read the guidelines, no sketches, B) finish it up and then maybe you can post it C) Stop drawing in spiral notebooks for god sakes. 

-etc


read the sidebar before posting.... thats what its there for. 


Title Formatting Guidelines:

Titles should be to the point, and all extraneous information or context should be added in the comments. Make sure to follow the following title format or else your post may be removed.

Your own artwork - "Title, medium, size"

Another artist's work - "Title, Artist, Year"

An album of artworks - "Title, medium"

An album without a title and the medium changes between works - "Collection of my (or another artist's) work."

An article - "Title, Year"

Discussions should always made as a self post. Expand on your question in the text and please include image examples where possible.

Submission Do's:

Do add flair after submitting your post by clicking on the "Please Add Flair to Your Post" red button, and then selecting whether it is an "Artwork," "Article," "Discussion," etc. If you are looking for feedback and critique please add the "Artwork C C" flair to your post.

Do credit the artist and provide a link to their site in the comments whenever possible.


Submission Don'ts:

Do not make multiple posts instead of an album, and do not re-post your work because you think it didn't get enough upvotes.

Do not state it's your first time using a medium in the title and do not write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?' 'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). And do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

Do not submit work that is a sketch, a doodle or an unfinished work (unless it is a discussion looking for help on how to finish). You can post those to other subreddits like /r/IDAP, /r/sketches, /r/doodles instead.

Do not post memes, and those who post melted crayon 'art' will be banished.

No requests for tattoos or artwork commissions (check out /r/designjobs), and links to pages selling work should be submitted to another subreddit such as /r/artstore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's actually a fairly accurate description. Most appreciation for the arts starts with memetic representation, so when people begin down the artistic path (often in HS) they try to draw things as realistically as they can. The problem with this pursuit is that after the invention of the camera, memetic drawing/ painting became realistically obsolete. Prior to the photo, paintings where used to record people/ places/ things as realistically as possible, they as documentation of nobles and the like. After photography, a photo could better represent a person cheaper/ faster and often more accurately than a painting. So what will become of painting? Painting began a path that lead to more expression/ abstraction/ creativity which separated it from its memetic counterpart, the camera. So getting back to the HS thing people start off painting realistically (in HS) build a skill set (which is needed) and eventually mature and grow to create work that is t purely a memetic portrait that a camera could do, but rather an expression of creative will. 

I hopes this helps understand that OP isn't being an ass hole art snob he's just a making realistic point about the current state of reddit/ and the lack of "mature" art being displayed in this sub.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Luke, this isn't related to anything in this thread but, I just wanted to say that you were the first artist that really got me into art. I've always loved the juxtapostion between your playful/ fun characters and the dark and ominous conflicts they find themselves in. Target was the piece of yours which I saw, and still one of my favorite pieces of yours. I copied a couple of your paintings when i was in HS, ("Fan Art"   "Life in a Blender" are still on your Sightings page). Your work has had a huge, and lasting impact on my own work/ style, and I just wanted to say thank you being the being the person that got me into art. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh i miss that game. I was an Imperial TKM/Comando, would hang out in Anchor Head (undeclared), and challenge those damn rebels to duels, while claiming to be helping them train their PVP skills so we could defeat the imperials. I would start the duel knock them down, start them on fire while they were on the ground, then /endduel. even though the duel was over, the fire kept burning, they'd become incapacitated, get up, but they'd still be on fire, become incapacitated again, eventually, then they'd die with a full black bar, cursing me every time they got up, and there was nothing they could do. 

then i'd /declare and wipe out all the rebel scum. Those i dueled would come out, say "WTF, i thought we were one of us." I''d laugh, drop an AT-ST and light them back on fire.

So many rebels died at by my flame, it was good.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I mean if you 61% done and still don't like it, well your probably not going to change your mind based on strangers on the internet telling you that you should like it. 

But the story is what makes it for me, using SW galaxy/ cannon while making a story arch entirely seperate from the movies. The tale of a "common" soldier that ascends thru the ranks. Plot twists flip the entire game on its head. Your squad who will judge your actions. Just the scale and lore of the game were great. The ability to chose your play style (dark siders for life) which affects the game.

I'm going to assume you are younger, and no bit saying this to be an elitist old gamer. You have to realize when this game came out on the original Xbox the graphics were pretty good. And the gameplay (although a bit choppy and heavy) were pretty decent back in the day. Its the problem going back and playing older games that everyone says are amazing, they may have a great story, but if your distracted by chunky gameplay awkward handling, and poor graphics by today's standards, it may make it much harder to be able to enjoy/ immerse yourself in the story, which is why so many people fell on love with it. It's like FF3 for me, it's toted as one of the best FFs ever but since I'm playing it 20 years after it came out the graphics/ gameplay just take me entirely out of the story. I'm about 15 hours in and just got bored.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> tell your brother to push his darks further, to create more contrast. like the behind the ear, increase the value range to help the ear pop out more. Also the color blood/ tears/ whatever really flattens the image. there are different things to try, like having the color go behind the drawing, and then coming back up which could help it feel like 2 totally seperate layers. Try using different color/tones/values in the color closer to the viewer to help the create volume/ space.


Also read the submission guidelines prior to posting. here are a list of the guidelines that you've failed to follow (though unfortunately it seems the mods have stopped enforcing these):

1) Please title your posts - Title, medium, size, if you are posting another artist's work please title it - Title, Artist, Year and add the "Artwork" flair after submitting your post. If any of these details are unknown leave it blank. If you are looking for feedback and critique please add the "Artwork C C" flair to your post.

2) Context in the comments of your post. And don't be subjective in the title.

3) Please include information about the medium(s).

4) You don't need to say 'A ____ I did' or a variation thereof. Titles should follow the first bullet-point.

5) Do not use Karma-bait titles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, so i'm no painter so i won't comment on your technical prowess, but instead lets talk about subject matter. So the subject matter, to me screams instagram/ "just girly things" now i think you could embrace that make these fine art pieces that are images which in the world of cyberimagery are quickly fleeting moments and turning them into these elegant perfectly rendered paintings. 

The first person that came to my mind when thinking of someone for you to look at was one of my favorite painters, Ralph Goings. He is/was (not sure if hes still alive) a photo realistic painter famous for his dinner scenes. often he would paint just the condiments of a typical dinner's table. There is about elevating these overly mundane/ very low brow objects and elevating them to the status of something worth of a photo realistic painting. the pure idea (imo) of being turning something very common into this painting, which was origianally something that was only for the elite flips the items value and elevates it to become else something all together.

this being said if you continue to create work with a simular vien, be prepared to have to justify your subject matter, and you may be called a very kitche artist, but if you want, embrace that, or change what you do.... theres no right or wrong direction to go, its all up to you. </TEXT>

Also as for the catastrophe, so i used my graphic chemical ink for most of the rainbow rolls, exept the blue on the end, that was a random ink i found in my studio. don't know the exactly what happened but when i put the black layer on it looked fine, but when it dried it dried perfect on most of the print, but where it dried on the blue was just really awkward looking. there was basically a line straight across where the blue ink started that ink just didn't dry flat. its slightly noticable in the linked pic along the top bar of the bike frame.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cave art was revolutionary. It was the first time that anyone had used pictoral mark marking to record thing/events. It was the genesis of 2D art as we know it. This shit carving on the wall is... a shit carving on a wall, and has no historical significance nor has it helped the progression of art in any way shape or form. This wall carving is the equivalent of some guy in 100 years finding a random old high school math notebook  with a doodle in it and proclaiming it as a artistic treasure, nope it's just a doodle... Just like this wall. So your comparison is an ill informed attempt to justify the the artistic merit of this carving.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, this is getting obnoxious, first the Longpack guys, now this new card guy. I'm all for printmakers starting up a new business, and using /r/printmaking to tell other people about it, hell Reddit is a great place for like minded people to gather and network, and discuss ideas. but this sub is PRINTMAKING.... traditional art printmaking*. if your going to tell us about your business at least be a printmaker for god sake.

Although this sub is small, and it isn't super active, it is still one of my favorite subs. Its the only sub of mine which i look at every post thats submitted. And i'm honestly getting quite annoyed with it due to spam, and the lack of anything being done about it. Now i'm not calling for a super strict policy change or anything of the sort, but I would like something to happen, whether it a couple extra mods, an update of the rules (to ban/ warn these spambot posts) or something. 

I know this is just a bit of a rant, but i don't want to abandon this sub, but i'm tired of seeing this trash on my newsfeed,

*traditional art printmaking: overly simplified but printmaking in regard to this sub is too general of a subject so simplify with a short/ precise explanation. Yes the image on the side of a box of Wheeties IS printmaking.... but that doesn't mean it belongs in /r/printmaking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Artistic Critiques aside, I'd like to give you some simple advice, when documenting your work, take the time to do it well. Set up lights (or use natural lighting), shoot it straight on (unless your going to have multiple shots), if need be SLIGHTLY touch it up in Photoshop (or similar program). When documenting your work your trying to give the viewer the most accurate portrayal of the work possible, since they can't see it in person. Especially on the age of the internet, everything you post could go viral, it can last on internet archives forever, so take a little bit of time to document you work correctly. 

Also the better you document your work, the more professional your work seems, and the more likely your work will be taken Seriously.  </TEXT>

later at the LBS i'm getting it checked out, talking with the mechanic, everything seems pretty much fine, i say something to the extent of " If its nothing serious, its not a big deal, not trying to make this girl spend a lot of money" he says, "was she cute?" i say " yah" he adjusts a couple spokes, gives me this estimate to send to her, and tells me to come back and tell him how it goes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The kinda silly thing about the no selling art thing, is often if you don't put a link to buy stuff like this, the top post is most likely going to be something to be some extent of "I want to buy this" at which point it isn't frowned upon to post a link to a shop, but by the time a shop link is posted by the OP the (x) amount of people that upvoted the original "I want to buy this" post aren't going to come back and check to see if there is a link to buy it later on.  Thus losing potential for the artist. 

I know, I know, I don't want this sub to become a art thrift shop, or just businesses spamming their shirts/ products here, but I don't have a problem with individuals posting links to their site if people want to buy their stuff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is /r/art not /r/pics, karma whoring titles are frowned on around here. If the work can't stand on its own artistic merit, it shouldn't be able to stand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also in the states, but if you buy me a plane ticket I'll be there tomorrow. :) 

But really, good luck, I still thing steam rolling would get the best/ most even print, IMO hand printing is so much harder to get a consistent print, not to mention it'll take 100x longer to do by hand   </TEXT>
