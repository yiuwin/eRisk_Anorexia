	<TEXT> Yes, exclusion causes terrorism, and it's quite a bold claim that "we have been trying for only 40 years" to integrate them. We haven't.

horseshit. did your father become radicalized or start plotting massacres in swiss clubs? no? did any other french expats in switzerland? well that's strange isn't it? what about mexicans in the US? poles in UK? if exclusion were to produce terrorism we should expect to see a lot more diversity when it comes to terrorism right?

	<TEXT> this is just propaganda unfortunately

US is patently more free than sweden yet they rank so low. This is just a "liberal politics index".


for example: 

- Sweden has more prohibitive hate speech laws than US

- US is more free with regards to marijuana and alcohol, what you are allowed to say in commercials, who you are allowed to target commercials to (children), what you are allowed to put in groceries, sex work and porn, in what conditions you are allowed to breed farm animals, how you are allowed to slaughter animals, and obviously gun laws. 

Most swedes don't think these are bad things though but the point remains: US has more *freedom*, which is not the same as a safe, stable, sane, and secure society - in fact it is often the opposite. </TEXT>

it sounds a little odd but under a general growth period a nation actually *"wants"* to be in debt


romania's debt, I would argue, should be higher, given the growth they've had recently. But I guess they have that EU money acting in a similar way

the true purpose of the "consensus debate" is to create as much obfuscation as possible between the initial statements and the end agreement so that whatever comes out of the meeting is the product of the meeting, not belonging to any participant but instead is attributed to the meeting itself as a kind of proxy for a third-party authority </TEXT>
