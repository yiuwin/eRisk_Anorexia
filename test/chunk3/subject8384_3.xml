It hurts me to admit it but I catch myself crying more often over the last few weeks and I don't even know why, I just know that I'm sad but not really why.. I also don't want to go to a doctor because I'm afraid that my future employer could see it..  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>     "Although a series can change as it creatively finds itself, TV directors agree that a pilot often is the best representation of a show. Its where you really establish tone, says Tucker Gates, who directed the Bates Motel (A E) pilot. You establish look. You establish performance and characters and the rhythms of the show. Its a chance for a director to come in and create that. Thats why those episodes are nominated more than others."

	<TEXT> Abiball was amazing here in germany. I have been an exchange student in the states but everybody is trying to "behave" at prom in the states and its really awkward but at abiball / final prom in germany all just have a good time, party dance and get drunk with the teachers and talk about everything before eventually seeing most of them never again. (of course everybody was still dressed up pretty and everything) </TEXT>
