	<TITLE> The Six Nations must stay on Freeview TV </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-24 17:21:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I thought I would just put this post here as I remember a while ago there were posts saying that there was interest from companies such as Sky Sports to get the rights to host the coverage. Source: [Telegraph](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33463368)  

I feel it is so important that this tournament stays on freeview. The amount of people that end up watching these games while flicking through the channels is astounding. Every weekend in February and March I hear people of all ages and genders mentioning that they enjoyed the game. I feel if Sky Sports, BT Sport or another pay per view company took hold of the tournament then that feeling of buzz and excitement would recede somewhat.   

I understand Freeview has the rights until around 2021 however I fear for the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is anyone available to photoshop a giveaway poster as I will be giving away 150 in Lions stash to promote my montage site. If anybody is good at that sort of thing then could they please do it in [this](http://i.imgur.com/GcrJJe3.png) style. 

If they could remove the maxi power  things and make the background lions red! Also maybe replace the english players with a sprinkling of celtic men then that would be perfect. 

I can pay for this lads. Thanks in advance.

I was guilty of being a hill camper recently but I took the advice to switch from a sniper to a carbine and the results have been phenomenal. I have been top scorer on the last 3-4 games now and it's thanks to you.

	<TEXT> To the people asking why this is not really an issue. This never usually is an issue however it is different when it comes to a page like In the Loose. THESE PAGES PROFIT from posts like these going viral in some way or another. People who post or reshare onto this sub just do it for fun but ITL ultimately want to make money out of it.
