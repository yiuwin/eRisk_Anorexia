	<TEXT> I agree. It's more important to have a system that actually deters crime and improves human flourishing than to have something LaVey would have smiled upon. Even if it turns out that involves compassion for the perpetrators.

Agreed, that also lines up perfectly with the 7th and possibly 5th tenets of the Satanic Temple (i'm a fan of their work) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure what's so hard to understand about that

I understand what they're saying, I guess it's the implied "they were asking for it!" that grinds my gears, as though by drawing a cartoon making fun of muhammad it's perfectly reasonable and expected for you to be brutally killed. 
I just want to know where these two heard this exact phrase, was it someone well-known making the case that the artists should have been killed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that since they both said it **exactly** the same way, like they were quoting a favourite bit from a TV show or something, that they probably heard it from somewhere, whether it was a TV/radio show or some guy on Youtube (or maybe it's just a common catchphrase in parts of Cork/Kerry idk), and i'm just curious about where exactly it originated </TEXT>
