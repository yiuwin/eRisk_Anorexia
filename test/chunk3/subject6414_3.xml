	<TEXT> Being able to problem solve is an important skill in life. While we generally apply problem solving to business matters, problem solving skills can also help deal with addictions like porn (and really anything in life).

I recently discovered a grear book I suggest you guys read: Problem Solving 101 by Ken Watanabe. While you can buy the book on Amazon, you can probably find a free copy somewhere. Over all it's a great book with great insight and applications on effective problem solving strategies.

	<TEXT> I stood in front of the wall, blinded by the light in front of me. Through my fingers I saw what appeared to be a large hole, from which the light was coming from. My eyes screamed for me to turn away, yet curiosity got the better of me. I endured the light, and ever so slowly did its brightness wane. 

Putting my hands down I stood in front of the hole in the wall. Beyond the hole I saw things I could not imagine, could not comprehend. Everywhere was so bright...and vivid....full of life. It was nothing like the world I knew. It seemed so enticing, yet I was afraid, afraid of something I did not understand. Yet I was always a curious man, and I stepped out of my world into this new one.

I was out in this new world for but a second when three horses descended upon me. Startled, I cringed away from them as they circled me. And then they did something more astonishing; they talked. "Truth, Beauty, Goodness, which shall you choose?" I stood, gaping at them. "Hurry and choose, they are coming." I was terrified and confused, but i managed to shout, "Truth! I want Truth!"

The white horse came foward and touched my head with his. Suddenly, I *knew*, knew everything and anything. But it was too much. I screamed and cried and begged for it to go away. The horses were gone though, and everything around me was shifting into a mess of different colors. Screaming in pain, I ran back toward my old world, through the hole, back into the darkness. Two men dressed as police officers awaited me. But I knew what they were, I knew Truth. They were corpses, with rotting flesh and missing teeth. This whole town was nothing but a land of undead, everything an illusion, a lie. I knew what animated them, a terror even greater than imaginable. 

"Please, take it away! Please!" I cried, on my knees, begging, begging for it to go away. I could not handle the Truth anymore, it was to real, to painful. I watched one of the corpses put his hand on me, and I knew no more.

"Honey, you okay?" I turned over, looking at my wife who was lying beside me on our bed. "Yeah, just a little tired", I groaned, rubbing my eyes. "Hopefully not tired enough for this", she giggled, leaning in and kissing me. As I watched her mount me I thought I detected the faintest gleam of laughter in her eyes.

	<TEXT> I woke up to sound of explosions and screaming. The house rocked, and the curtain rods fell. Outside I saw my neighborhood in flames, as odd looking ships flew across my hometown, lighting up houses as they went. People were scattered across the streets, some dead, others wounded.

Cursing, I did the one thing I could; I grabbed my phone. I went to my only savior, my God: the Internet. Yet I felt a twinge of guilt. Why wasn't I getting up and trying to help the injured, see what was going on? My mind toiled with excuses, as I battled the desire to help my fellow man. Then I saw the date: April 1st. Laughing, I settled down and opened up Reddit. Surely everything I saw was just an illusion. It wasn't as bad as it seemed. Perhaps I would go check it out later.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess what I'm wondering is where this self-shame comes from. The only real possibility that comes to mind is that we hear how bad masterbation is, and when we masterbate, we inflict this shame upon ourselves. But like I already pointed out, masterbation is generally touted as natural and healthy.

So the sense of shame has to come from somewhere or something. And it seems to me that the sense of shame comes from the act of masterbating itself, and the baggage that comes with it. Masterbation/porn is generally used as a coping mechanism for stress, loneliness, boredom, depression, etc. that overwhelms us. Of course, PMO does nothing to make these problems go away, so we're left with the shame that were hiding from our problems as they continue to get worse. And of course masterbation itself is degrading; sitting alone in your room, in front of some screen watching two people have sex. Does anyone think that's healthy? Putting aside possible problems like erectile dysfunction and premature ehaculation, porn is ultimately lonely and devoid of any real relationship and substance. Now of course, not everyone who masterbates is going to feel shame or be negatively effected by PMO. But the reality is many people do. For all these reasons, I think that the shame that comes from PMO is valid and justified. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My religion did imply that masterbating was less than perfect, but not that it was a deadly mortal sin or something. But honestly, I never really cared what my religion taught. 

It's hard for me to imagine shame being a factor here. Masterbation is generally seen as a good, healthy practice in moderation, something the majority of men do. And I can't see how religion would really shame someone unless that person was very devoted to that religion, which is increasingly rare in the modern world. I mean, it is harder to be shamed by an act that no one knows your doing. We don't exactly go around with a scarlett "M" necklace to let the world know we masterbate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. I, and I'm sure many others, "felt bad" about fapping and then found NoFap and heard why fapping was not good for you. So in that case it's not self-inflicted guilt.

And yes, there is actually evidence that NoFap has benefits compared to fapping. Aside from testimonial evidence, studies show that testosterone increases by abstaining from ejaculation.

And I'm sure you know the benefits of increased test (easy enough to look up).

	<TEXT> I respectfully disagree. If you understand the dopamine reward system, you see that NoFap is not just Placebo. Here's an article on it linked below: 
https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-love/201507/the-dopamine-reward-system-friend-or-foe

The key point is this: "The problem is how we stimulate the dopamine pathway." If we stimulate the pathway through masterbation, we end up "seeking dopamine from all the wrong places." This in turn makes it harder to connect with real people with real relationships. 

There are also problems porn use can cause like "death grip" and premature ejaculation. So I think it's fair to say that NoFap is more than just Placebo. </TEXT>
