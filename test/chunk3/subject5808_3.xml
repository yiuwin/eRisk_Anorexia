	<DATE> 2016-10-13 00:45:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey dudes and dudettes. 

Looking at getting my first valve amp in years and I'm leaning very heavily towards a Diamond Spitfire II.

This is an amp I've had my eye on for a while since I found out that Jade from AFI uses them. I love his tones so it's something that I'm 100% interested in checking out.

There's only one dealer in Melbourne, Australia and only one of these in stock at a cool $2800. So this is an Amp I'm planning on having forever and gigging with for many, many years to come.

So why the post? Well. Does anyone else here use Diamond? What are your thoughts as far as longevity goes, are you happy with the tones and how versatile are they really?

Cheers. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-09-23 09:25:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Growing up I went from a standard shape strat copy straight into an epiphone explorer and hated it. I wasnt ready to make the change with all them points.

So i sold it and got an epi SG. Since then ive aquired a tele and a les paul copy. But ive always been keen on giving a V a go. 

Not just for experimental purposes but the idea of easily reaching the upper frets has always been interesting to me.

So I was browsing eBay the other day and caved. I got an LTD V-50 . One of the lower end of the LTD Models but it doesn't phase me for my first V. Havent plugged it in yet but had a bit of a fuckaround at work and loving the accessibility. Cant wait to get my strap installed and give it a proper standup go. 

Here she is posing next to a train. Cos why the hell not

	<TEXT> Hey guys, so a bit of a question, we're a small independent punk outfit from Melbourne, Australia. We've been asked if our music can be used in a small independent film.

Simple enough really. Except with films it's hard to tell whether or not they're going to be super successful or not.

Should we be working out some kind of deal with the film makers to have our film on the soundtrack as far as money is concerned?

We're not too phased about it at the moment but if in the long run the film does well, I can imagine we'll be kicking ourselves. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys and girls. Bit of an obscure question about when the field runners started appearing in the AFL/VFL

People running drinks out to the players or coaching directions etc. 

If it was pre-2000, what kind of things were they wearing. As far as I know, the pink highlights on their uniforms and stuff only came into effect recently and I can't really remember what they used to look like or if they were there at all.

The reason I ask is that we're filming a music video and want to have a runner, but it's 80s themed and I don't even know if they existed.

Cheers </TEXT>

He keeps climbing and reaches another woman, this time far more attractive than the first, she says "Keep on climbing the ladder to success", so he does.

Next he reaches a stunning woman, 10/10, who says seductively, "Keep climbing the ladder to success", excitedly, he begins rushing until he reaches the top where lying on top of a platform is an old, nude man.

He then proclaims "Who the hell are you?" and the man replies "I'm Cess".

	<TEXT> So its 4:34 a.m. and I'm currently sitting outside of my dorm room at my hostel because I've just killed 3 bed bugs and will be fucked if im going back in that bed. Its freezing in Sydney :( 

I just tried to warn my friends who I am staying with and they just shrugged it off.

Worst part is is that I had bites on my feet, legs and arms yesterday but disregarded them as mosquitos maybe. Now my suspicions are confirmed, I am so pissed. I'm going to recommend a room change to start and if that doesn't work im going to demand our money back and we'll go somewhere else. 

We also have a gig to play tonight. That will be fun when my skin feels like it's on fire :( 

Anyway... just something I had to say </TEXT>

Long story short I'm from a Melbourne punk rock group who are looking to come to Adelaide for the first time in years and were wondering about any regular nights you guys might have where the promoter puts on bands?

If these don't exist at the moment could you recommend some smaller venues, 100 capacity max, that might be suitable for us to organize a show at?

	<TEXT> Alright guys. So i need some advice.

I've always played in punk and metal bands, and whilst that is one side of what I do and I love doing it. I also have a real melodic streak and love softer acoustic music.

I want to start heading down that path creatively but feel i have cornered myself into the harder genres to a point I don't want to expose this other side to people i know.

Does anyone else suffer this? I'd love some opinions or advice. Cheers. </TEXT>

My group is coming over to the United Kingdom from Australia and are looking to book small to medium venues in the below cities... We're looking at around 100 people capacity venues per each show as it's our first time coming over and don't want to overdo it. 

So if you could help me out by suggesting some venues to contact in each of these cities, that would be awesome!
