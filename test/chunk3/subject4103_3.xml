	<TEXT> I was also sad about the absence of the witches, but I realized recently that they're showing up in his YA Discworld novels (the Tiffany Aching series). I initially avoided reading them because I didn't want to be disappointed by "dumbed down" Pratchett, but I was looking for 8th grade graduation gifts for some of my ~~minions~~ students, and I wanted to know if they were good. They are. Very much so. All the brilliance of Pratchett, with only minor tweaking for the YA audience. It loses none of what makes his books great. So hopefully I created some new fans.

That being said, my favorites were always the Watch. I still want to be Captain Carrot when I grow up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I can't think of anyone I know being exterminated by the Church, either. Of course, there's such a thing as a latae sententiae excommunication, where people excommunicate themselves through obstinate rejection of doctrine. I think a round of excommunications for public figures would do wonders, but the bishops seem to be too afraid of backlash. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, considering that Catholics believe that taking the Eucharist unworthily (in a state of mortal sin) or while not being in communion with the Catholic Church is in fact harmful to a person's spiritual well-being, it's possible the priest was simply panicked out of concern for her well-being and reacted on impulse. It's also possible he's a jerk who was trying to shame her in front of the congregation. I don't know the man, but I tend to assume good motives unless proven otherwise. Does he have a history of this sort of treatment of others? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I drive by the school on my way to work every day. I went to that school growing up. My parents live near several of the families whose children died. I recognized at least one last name as the same last name as a guy I went to school with from elementary to high school - no idea if the girl was related to him though. One of my students had an aunt who was one of the adults killed, and I currently teach another student who transferred in after his sister was killed. If anyone said something like this to my face, I might legitimately slug them. They have no idea how hard this rocked the community here. If there were some kind of stupid conspiracy attempt, it would have taken all of 10 minutes to break, since so many families here know each other and would have noticed "Jerry never had a son" or "Gayle's daughter is fine - they just moved away last year." The lengths people will go to to believe that there is some secret cabal orchestrating everything and there aren't just crazy or evil buggers who occasionally do bad things... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lifelong Sandy Hook resident here. There were minor memorials done here in town, like the one at my church. We, as a community, basically told the media to eff off during the anniversary. There were signs all over the area and all lawns of businesses and major gathering locations saying that the media was requested to stay away. Our First Selectman made official statements to this effect as well, and we had police presence all over town to enforce this. Many of the families involved went away on vacation to avoid any potential intrusions. We wanted to keep it private and in-house rather than having media dredge up old feelings for their own sensationalism. </TEXT>

I still really enjoy the books and the characters, but I can see that as being a tad grating for some people. For me, I probably least enjoyed the Rincewind/wizards books, which isn't saying much considering I love the whole series. I also can't put my finger on why. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't know where you got that impression, but that's not true. Purgatory is a defined doctrine, so it can't be changed by any council. Perhaps you were thinking of Limbo? That's always been theological speculation so there's no definite teaching on it. It's open to personal interpretation whether or not it exists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I wouldn't have capitalized "theists", either. Atheism is more of a classification than a specific belief system. It often implies philosophical materialism and empiricism, but not always. It's too broad to be considered a denomination. So I'd say it's not a proper noun.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, it is true that anyone can get to Heaven, but your time in Purgatory is based on how much junk needs to be cleaned out of your soul before you're fit for Heaven, not what religion you followed.

	<TEXT> Not exactly...people who go to Purgatory are on their way to Heaven. They are being purified of their sins since nothing unclean can enter Heaven. Some people go straight to Heaven, if they die in a state of grace. Some go straight to Hell, if that's what they choose. But nobody goes from Purgatory to Hell. I hope I'm not coming off as arrogant - I'm just trying to correct misconceptions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few things to note:

1. The Pope didn't say anything new, just reworded old teaching that everyone knew about before.

2. The media reported what he said incorrectly.

3. The Vatican released their statement to let the media know that they were wrong about what Pope Francis said, not that Pope Francis was wrong about what he said.

4. The media again reported the statement incorrectly by saying they were correcting the Pope.

To summarize: Christ died to redeem everyone, including atheists, Jainists, Muslims, and what have you. That part's not new, as much as the media have sensationalized it. Salvation, however, is dependent on accepting God, since He's not going to force Himself on you. The Pope is not a Universalist, who believes that everyone bar none is going to Heaven no matter what. The Pope is not a Pelagian, who believes that a person can earn Heaven on their own, without Christ. If the people reporting things actually knew any Catholic doctrine, the speech he made would have been a non-issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think you're too skinny. I think you look extremely attractive the way you are. And I'm the sort of person who doesn't like overly-skinny women. It depends on their body types. Some people are meant to have a bit more weight on them and they look good with it, so they would look bad if they weighed as much as you. It's more about how healthy you look. You look like you're around the exact weight you should be in order to maximize your attractiveness, so don't worry about that. I think the vast majority of straight guys would think you're attractive and not see any "chicken legs" or "knobby knees" that you're worried about.

edit: I'm also not saying you wouldn't be attractive any more if you put on a few pounds. You'd still look good, I think. There are also people recommending that you put on muscle, which I would totally be behind, mostly because I find strong, tough women incredibly hot. I may be slightly biased because of that though... </TEXT>
