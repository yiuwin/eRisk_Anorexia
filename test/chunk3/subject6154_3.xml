No need to be. You can always appeal. True "false flagging" is EXTREMELY rare. And take it from me - I've created 2,500+ videos, and collected a sizable group of haters in my 10 years on the site. Believe me, if you could 'false flag' a channel - I'd have been gone long ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Portal 2 is so much better, which is actually confusing, because I rated Portal 1 a 9/10. Better story, longer experience, more gimmicks / puzzles / challenges, etc.

And the addition of community-made maps allows for basically never-ending gameplay. It's phenomenal. 

I'd also recommend Portal: Prelude, and Portal: Pro - both are free 3rd-party mods/creations with limited stories. Fun, and challenging though! </TEXT>

As a single-disc album, it would have been great (the title track, 'Drive All Night', 'Hungry Heart', etc).

Lucky you! Not only were the concepts of sponsored-videos not a thing back in 2007-2011, but no company wanted to touch our show. It was deemed to risky and dangerous. As it is, most of our best episodes are age-restricted, and don't even earn AdSense revenue :-(

The term you're looking for is "RPM" = revenue per thousand.

And the site-wide average, in 2016 is around $1. Before 2012 or so, it used to be average closer to $2.5, and upwards of $10 for long-form, multiple-ad content. </TEXT>

I don't know if "Struggling" is the right word, but revenues are certainly way down. Unfortunately, it's due to YouTube's changing CPM values and algorithms - so even if we had the same viewership as in Microwave's heyday (in fact, we're not far off) - revenue would still be 20% of what it used to be.

Anyway, I approve of this idea! Please come back and visit, I'm still making new content every day! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Coming from NH through the rush hour, and then concert-traffic meant I spent about 5+ hours on the road yesterday, but it was 100% worth it. 11th show I've seen of his (at least one from each E Street tour since The Rising) - and this was unquestionably the best I've ever seen. So, my three things:

* The weather / vibe. Clear skies, a cool breeze - and everyone was just having an absolute blast. I kept looking up to the full moon and thinking how it was a perfect summer evening to close out the tour.

* That string of songs towards the middle of the set, "Lost In The Flood"  "Kitty's Back"  "Incident"  "Rosalita" into "No Surrender" and "Boom Boom"  "Darkness On The Edge Of Town" was downright phenomenal. I was on cloud 9 the entire time.

* Bruce's political 'speech' before 'Long Walk Home" - a real underrated gem from the "Magic" album. Admonishing the state of politics today, he seemed ready to say something - possibly an endorsement of Hillary, or something definitive against Trump? But you could hear him stop himself short, and just decided to introduce the song. It was a unique moment - curious what he was planning to say.

Wonderful evening. Third longest ever for him - and "Jungleland" was just poetry.  </TEXT>

There are some fun cases of 20+ year old films getting nominated, because they weren't screened around Hollywood until two decades after the rest of the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And I love how you completely missed the entire point of that video. (viewers and subs actually went WAY UP in the years following TMS's retirement). 

And as for "what you subscribed for" - I don't really care. /Jogwheel is a *variety* channel. ALWAYS has been. When I posted "Microwave" 40x a year, it didn't seem to bother you that I also uploaded three other shows - *including* "Movie Night". Also, how the hell do five separate movies reviews, and a comedy-sketch qualify as a "half hour rant"? You were quick to call this show "shitty", but it's obvious you've never watched a single second of it.

And what's with calling me "the host" - in a *direct reply* to me? You're either an idiot who didn't realize who he was talking to, or worse - needlessly rude. Pay better attention; your selfish demands and ignorance are very unbecoming. 

But hey, thanks for watching! </TEXT>

And yet, the channel didn't have nearly the amount of traction I was hoping for, hence my lack of enthusiasm / desire to continue it :-)

 Are there any plans for the three of you to collaborate on another series like this?

Yes, but not one "like" TMS. </TEXT>
