	<TEXT> Could someone please explain how the United States has managed to do a complete u-turn on the decision to cancel the f35 program?

I also seem to recall plans being put into place to convert the Aircraft Carriers to CATOBAR configuration, and purchase of Dassault Rafaels for basing on them. What has become of these plans, if I am correct? </TEXT>

If you go there, I promise you a very pleasant evening.

All the waiters are good with kids and there is a decent play area, with balloon animals to boot.

If you are over Protaras way, there is a wonderful expat haunt called Mojito. Fabulous food and drink, with an atmosphere that feels vaguely English, despite being in a foreign country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have thought a claudian era roman legion and associated auxiliaries would be able to hold their own against a western European army of the early 15th century. At that time, the majority of armies were still drafted from the peasantry, whereas the roman legion was primarily volunteers. This gives significant boosts in terms of morale.

In addition, the Western European army would be trained to take on enemy soldiers individually and attack solo. The romans favoured fighting as a unit. This would give them an advantage, if they were able to close the distance with the enemy and defeat them close quarters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The romans would simply face the same fight, once they'd closed the distance, as they'd had against the Celts and Gauls who favoured long swords. At that distance, the stabbing techniques of the legionaries will easily trump the long swords of the French infantrymen. Both armies would by armoured with mail shirts, so I think it would be a fairly even fight, once they were close enough. </TEXT>

Does anyone know of a mod that allows me to switch the textures of the engine shrouds ingame? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why were metal slug weaponry never used by Starfleet? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-01 16:54:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The first thing to consider is whether the energy shielding employed by starfleet and the rest of the star trek races is capable of stopping a fairly large metal slug. 

Second thing to consider is whether it would be economical to produce a lot of metal bullets to be hauled by starships to be flung at enemy starships. 

The third thing to consider is physics. Once an object is travelling fast enough, it becomes nearly impossible to stop it. As a result, it would likely penetrate the hull of a starship or compound itself on the outside, damaging structural integrity. If enough of these were hurled at an opposing starship, a penetration becomes ever more likely, simply by probability.

What are your thoughts? Why do you think slug weaponry was not employed by starfleet?

EDIT: I am talking in the context of inter-ship fights, not personal shooting matches. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm afraid I cannot agree with my right honourable friend, Mr Wibble. If you ask me, the British armed forces needs substantial reorganisation and replacement of lost assets. The Falklands conflict proved that we still need a blue water navy as well as an expeditionary capability, in addition to expansion of the Royal Navy and Marines, but a radical downsizing of the Army. We are an island, and for that reason we should favour a larger navy to police our trade routes, the crucial oil route through the Suez Canal and ensuring that our fisheries are adequately policed and maintained. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone,

Started up KSP today, telling myself I would finally make it to Duna in a career mode save. 

First mission went nicely, second one, not so much. Tried it several times, but I am never able to slow down enough through the atmosphere to deploy the parachute safely. Have killed Jeb three times now.

Is my decent too steep? what do you guys do?

EDIT: I am on tier 2 of the tech tree. No drogues yet.

Thanks! </TEXT>
