	<TEXT> Many people hold Heir to the Empire dear to their hearts. I wouldnt compare them just yet. Heir to the Empire is (was) like an alternative episode 7 with all the main characters plus several very notable new ones. All the new books are really speaking, just "side" stories which are being written just to keep us happy until episode 8

	<TEXT> Hazram Namir in Twilight Company is pretty decent. Probably the best new character so far in my opinion. A rebel sargeant who isnt so interested in the aims of the alliance but fights because thats all hes ever known. Tough as bolts, experienced and packs a punch. 

The good thing is that Twilight Company focuses mainly on Namir so we get a good feel for his story. There is no jumping around to pointless characters that you may find in other books.

I would say he almost on par with Kyle Katarn, Mara Jade and others. I guess we'll have to see how his story develops in future content.

	<TEXT> ... Starkiller base fire its big beamy thing, how did all those present at the firing not get affected one bit?

I mean, that beam was able to blow up a whole star system but it didnt even affect star killer base itself. What explanation do they have for this? did the FO have some mega shield generator or something? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Snoke is pretty good. Its as odd as many other Star Wars names just like Bail Organa, Wedge Antilles, Boba Fett, Sio Bibble, Yarael Poof, Sy Snootles, Max Reebo,  Cornelius Evazan, Dud bolt, Teemto Pagalies, Biggs Darklighter, Qui Gon Jin, Poe Dameron and Itchy

If i HAD to change it, i'd make it Marka Ragnos, Vitiate or Naga Sadow </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the last surviving Jedi by TFA?

One of the things i loved about the EU was the abundance of diverse Jedi that were introduced in the post ROTJ world.

In the new canon, 30 years have passed since ROTJ and we only have Luke (and now Rey). 

I hope we will get some "lost" Jedi return in future movies. I think it sad that in future Star Wars literature and media, we will likely have a very small Jedi presence

	<TITLE> Watching "The Old Republic" trailers after watching TFA and comparing the two </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-11 01:29:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For a while, i believed that the footage in "The Old Republic" trailers would be the closest thing we would get to a new Star Wars movie. I watched them over and over and i still find them awesome. (Here is a youtube mix of them all for those who havent seen them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuNvCOUy1Ts)

Despite them being based 1000's of years before ANH, it still feels very much Star Wars. The story, characters, settings, sounds, effects and music... it is all very recognisable and exciting.

In contrast to TFA, which i loved very much i still feel it isnt as exciting and as recognisably Star Wars as the T.O.R trailers. After a bit of thinking, i think i understand why

TFA is more about your average Joe Shmoes whereas T.O.R is about godlike tough people with extraordinary abilities. The ratio of godlikes to joe shmoes in TFA is in the favour of the latter whereas in previous Star Wars, it was the former. I wouldnt necessarily classify Finn, Kylo, Hux or Snoke* as being "godlike" in any way. Although Han Solo, Darth Vader, Tarkin and Palpatine i definitely would. 

Rey, from the start is a tough character and has potential to become godlike. This is why i liked her the best out of the new characters.

I think personally, i'd rather watch a Star Wars movie with more god-like characters in it than average guys down the street. And i think this is why i much preferred the short trailers over the full length TFA movie. 

Thoughts? is my comparison a fair one? Or perhaps i am old-fashioned and need to embrace this new kind of storytelling.

*based on what little we have seen or know about snoke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those of us who loved the Legends story, here are some similarities with it to TFA:

* A descendant of Han and Leia turns to the dark side
* The name "Ben" is given to a descendant of Darth Vader
* Luke started a Jedi Academy. Which presumably flourished for a bit. Until it was destroyed.
* Lukes blue lightsaber has some significance to the story
* The millenium Falcon was lost by Han for some time. Then re-aquired.
* Luke Skywalker was in exile.
* An Imperial remnant makes use of a super weapon capable of destroying whole star systems. [Legends: sun crusher]
* A map to [what i presume is] an ancient Jedi location is pivotal to the story. [If you recall, in dark forces: Jedi Knight game, a map to the hidden valley of the Jedi is pivotal to the story.] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guess ill just have to judge this cover by its book. Not a fan of the design tbh.

I like the older book covers like Zahn and Anderson's trilogies. With the main characters at the front. Seems more star-warsy than this basic design. This is just my average Mr Joe Shmoe opinion. </TEXT>
