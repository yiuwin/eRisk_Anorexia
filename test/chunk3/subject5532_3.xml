	<TEXT> Hi guys,

I recently purchased a Panasonic HC-v720 camera, and in the recording setting I have the option of shooting 1080/50i PH1920, HA1920, HG1920 or HE1920, as well as 1080p/50p and iFrame. What is the difference between these modes and which one would be best?

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who really only listens to shitty trashy pop music at the moment (I know it's bad... but I still listen to it...) I want to really expand my listening...

So /r/Music, what would YOU consider to be the "required listening" of Music in general. From any time, any era, any place. Just give me some stuff.

Hopefully answers will allow me to discover a section of music I hadn't realised I liked until now, or allow me to build upon them to form my own required listening list...

Thanks!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently in the middle of making a very low budget student action films.

I'm looking at Action Essentials 2K version by video copilot, however it's out of our price range. Do you know any other alternatives?

I know this might be frowned upon by the community, but i'll ask my next question anyway. I found a torrent of action essentials. If I use that in my film, and I end up making profit off the film from YouTube or film festivals etc. can I end up getting in trouble cause I used stuff from an Action Essentials that was pirated? Can they even tell? 

Thanks </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys,
A teacher at my school (who is a massive LotR fan) and my best friend are have a trivia quiz battle/face-off this friday, and I need your help to formulate some questions!

I need some questions on

a). Some general LotR trivia (Who directed the movies, who played gollum, how many rings were given to the dwarves etc.) of easy difficulty. Basic stuff.

b). The events and plot of LotR/The War of the Ring of moderate difficulty. Eg. What is the name of the inn which Frodo et al visit in Bree (but that's really easy... harder than that)

c). Questions on the lore. That are hard. Like, DEEP into the lore. Stuff a casual fan wouldn't have the slightest clue about. Eg. Sauron is the lieutenant to who? However, even that question is pretty damn easy. These questions should be hard, but NOT impossible.

Any help would be appreciated! Also, if you give a question, please also provide an answer!

Thanks!!! </TEXT>
