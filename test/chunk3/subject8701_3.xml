It never actually used to be like that. But, companies were basing themselves in Jersey and shipping products into the UK (Play.com, Amazon.co.uk) without VAT. This meant the government was losing out on the VAT on CDs, Blu-Rays etc. When online shopping took off, all the rules changed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see how stalling the growth of cancer for 10 months is cost-effective. That money could be better spent on helping people actually survive. Sure, the person may find something that eradicates their breast cancer in the 10 months extra they have, but if they are at the point where they need this drug, it is unlikely. 

This is just something from Pfizer to say "look. we gave it for free. It is cheap. The NHS is scum". Drug companies would fucking love to bring down the NHS because they know that if the NHS was brought down, they could charge massive, massive prices for drugs.

The drug costing 79,560 is quite a lot. Think how many lives could be saved with that money elsewhere.

Fuck Pfizer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I notice how you are avoiding admitting that you were wrong about sexual assault in Sweden ;) Why are you ignoring that?

There is not a single area in Sweden I would not walk in. 

Also, you have to remember that there was a riot shortly after Trump made statements about riots in Sweden (which were not happening). Guess what happened? Ah yeah. Turns out a lot of migrants said they had been approached by RT and offered money to start a riot.

Have you ever been to Sweden or are you just going by what you read in the news (which is always going to be biased). You have to remember if something is not the norm, it is more likely to be covered in the news. If something is likely to generate advertising clicks, it is more likely to be featured in the news. Hence why you hear about Sweden a lot in the news. Things happening are unusual (i.e. barely ever happen) and because the media is in a frenzy about Sweden, it generates clicks and makes money.

I would appreciate if you did not call me fake news until you bother to do your research.

But yes, looks like you have jumped on the Trump bandwagon, as I said. </TEXT>

Now there is zero point in talking to you, because it is clear that you have carried out ZERO research into the situation. If you did, then you will know why Sweden's figures are higher than everywhere else ;) If you carried out more research, then you would actually find that Sweden probably has the lowest amount of rapes and sexual assaults in the Western World. But nope, you do not seem like the research type of chap. 

Also, if you must know, I have been regularly writing articles and carrying out massive research studies into rape in Sweden for over 10 years now. I am often used as the 'go to' source for publications around the world. So, don't tell me I have not done my research. It is what I get paid to do.

And no, he was not.

But geez. I am insulted that you have not even bothered to do your research about Sweden. I can accept this from an American. But a Canadian? Fuck this shit. The world is more fucked up than I thought. 

Here. Read my post:

Most leave supporters that I encounter on Reddit tend to talk about rather weird reasons for leaving the EU, not rooted in fact. But this is because I just gravitate towards dissecting their arguments and overlook anybody else. But, I know for sure that the leave supporters on my Facebook did not educate themselves. Most of them share shit from Brietbart and Prison Planet. Most seem to think that leaving the EU gets rid of Muslims.  </TEXT>

So no, I was not talking about every leave supporter. Kinda proves my point if you are a leave supporter, though. You didn't bother to read my post (i.e. do research) and instead snap at me.  </TEXT>

Netflix had TONS of phone calls from people trying to get the show revitalised. In fact, the show was so popular among the requests, it went into their newsletter. This never happens.

	<TEXT> They longer waiting periods are for those who are not in dire need of treatment.

My sister was suspected to have brain cancer a few years back. She was having a scan within hours of them suggesting it (went from GP right to the hospital). That is not a long wait at all. If they found something, they would have started to deal with it quickly.

The only time you are really going to be waiting around for healthcare is if you are not at immediate risk of dying. A broken arm, for instance, may take a week or so to have an operation carried out. That is not too long. A E may take a few hours to get seen (depending on how busy they are), but they will prioritise people based on their condition/age.

I have never found wait times to be an issue. Certainly, the fact that you are paying LESS money would help to counter any of those wait time issues anyway.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ONCE AGAIN.

Life expectancy and survival rates in countries with single payer healthcare is HIGHER than in the United States. This means that care is BETTER. PLEASE DRILL THAT INTO YOUR HEAD.

Cost of medical education in the US is higher because your industry is all about the money making. It would go down drastically if the industry was actually about helping people. Also, if you had single payer in place, you would use some of that money to subsidise medical education. 

Actually, a lot of the drugs in single payer healthcare systems are 'the real deal'. Many of the top drugs come from Swiss or British companies anyway. The only time a generic drug will be used is if the original creator of the drug is not willing to budge on their prices. Guess what? When they realise they amount of money they are losing by not getting into that market, they budge. If the NHS (for example) sticks with a generic drug then it is because it has been proven to be effective.

Drugs are INCREDIBLY cheap to buy in. Seriously. The drugs that you are paying $100s for are a couple of  under the NHS because the drug companies in single payer health markets know that they can't 'stiff' the patients otherwise they will lose access to a massive market.

Honestly. Right now, you are just stating you want to be fucked in the arse. Like, good and deep. That is what the insurance companies in the US are doing. That is what your government is doing. Yet, you are doing it. This is not the nice type of arse pounding either.  

I don't know why you are so wilfully ignorant to the amazing benefits that single payer healthcare brings. Time and time again I have shown you that healthcare is better under single payer. I have shown you that it is cheaper. What more could you possibly want? Oh. I know. You don't want to help other people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are aware that the European Union does not administer healthcare, right?

I said that one of the 'pros' of the European system is that you can go to any European country (if you are abroad) and receive treatment. On the off-chance that the EU breaks up (it won't), losing this benefit is not that big of a deal. The UK (and most countries, I would assume) have had single payer before the EU was a thing.

Tell me why you don't want single payer healthcare. Here are the benefits:

- It is cheaper
- Everybody is covered
- It is a more efficient system
- Survival rates are higher

Why would you not want it? Give me a genuine reason as to why single payer is such a bad thing. You already know that you are spending less and the treatment is better. What is so bad about it for you? 

-edit-

I just realised you can't differentiate between the European union and Europe. Geez. </TEXT>

So, please, tell me why single payer is bad. It has been proven to work time and time again, but the American system has not.

And I pay for healthcare in 2 countries. I know that I can rely on it should I lose my job, should I require constant healthcare, should I be injured overseas (because other European countries will take you in and just bill the NHS). I know that the system is going to be there to benefit me. I know it is going to be benefit the people around me. I know that if I am sick, I do not have to worry about financing my healthcare.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is very rare that a single payer health system will pay for the gender transition. It is normally a last resort thing. That is covered under private health. Don't worry, you probably will not pay for it. If you do pay for it, it is because the person is likely to end their life without it (lifesaving is good)

Oh, and it would not cost $100,000 under single payer because now there are not companies trying to make as much money as possible from your health. The government goes and says "you give us drugs at this price or we do not buy them". The company says "crap. we need this market" so they sell the drugs for a far lower price. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You do?

Because life expectancy in the US is lower, and cancer survival rates in the USA are ever so slightly higher (like 1 person per 100,000). However, it is likely that 'better' healthcare is not the reason.

If you go away from the UK and look at the other countries in Europe, all of them have better cancer survival rates than the US.

On the whole (away from cancer), life expectancy in Europe is higher than in the US.

So, when you say "you get what you pay for", do you mean "You don't pay a whole lot, but you get a far better chance of survival!"

Face it, man. Whatever Trump has up his sleeve, it is shit. The only route to go down to protect everybody is single payer. There are no 'ifs' or 'buts' about it.

Feel free to come with a snappy comeback to this, but it would be wrong. 

The reason why you are spending masses amount of money is *not* for better healthcare, it is because insurance companies want to screw you in the rear end and your government can't be arsed to set up a single payer scheme.

Again, also want to point out that the government in the US spends more per capita on healthcare than any country in Europe, so the money is there ;)

You just hate helping other people, don't you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are aware that under single payer, the costs for everybody gets lower, yes?

How much do you pay in insurance in America each year? Quite a lot, I imagine. Then you have the bit on top of that.

On a standard wage in the UK, I spend 2,000 out of my taxes each year. This means no excess. No expensive medication etc. etc. AND if I do not use it, I know that somebody else is benefitting from the money that I paid in.

Oh, and before you say "but healthcare is better in America". Survival rates for cancer are a teeny bit higher in the US than in the UK. I think it is a difference of 1 person per 100,000. This is a tiny figure and it is likely that there is other stuff to be considered here not just the quality of healthcare.

If you have cancer, you are not going to be kept around waiting for treatment in the UK. They will start as soon as possible. Somebody thought my sister had brain cancer. Did she wait weeks for a scan? No, they took her from the GP to the hospital within an hour. 

It is also worth noting that, on the whole, US has a lower life expectancy than Western Countries, which means the healthcare does seem to be better there.

Do you not care about other people?  </TEXT>

On this account, there is a lot of false information. If you look at the gilded post I have, there is a reason for it.
