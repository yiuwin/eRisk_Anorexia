One of my best friends just got a new job and we're taking her out tonight to celebrate. I really struggle with trying to project an image of normalcy around my group, especially because a lot of my friends have terrible eating habits. Case in point, the place we're going tonight doesn't even have a salad option on the menu! But even if I were to get something like that, they'd give me a hard time. Fortunately the website has calorie counts so I picked the most reasonable one I can find. 

Here's hoping I'm able to stick to it and my friends don't make any commentary.

	<TEXT> Lmao it never happens to me either! But I feel you... honestly I don't even know what really possessed me to try it tonight because it's super high-risk, high-reward. Even the slightest fluctuations can completely ruin my mood :/ </TEXT>
