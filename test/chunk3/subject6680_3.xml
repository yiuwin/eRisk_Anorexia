	<TEXT> How long will it take before I start missing out on the DLC packs? Or are the DLC packs only of value once you hit max level?


So would the following make sense?

1. Buy base game for PC now.

2. Level to max level as Nord tank.

3. As soon as I hit max level (perhaps next month somewhere?) subscribe as an eso+ subscriber and get all the DLC plus other stuff.


Or is it better to just bite the bullet and get the Gold edition from the start? How much would future DLCs costs? Also how frequently are they released? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree 100% with you. I personally have had this happened to me when asking a question due to being very new to the game (been playing for two weeks now).

But there are also some genuinely good very helpful folks on this sub reddit as well.

I really don't understand the reason for the down votes though.

Sure we can Google some info, but the thing is the game changed so much from version 1.0 to now that it is difficult to find up to date info on the web. So this leads one then to believe that asking on this sub reddit is a sane way of getting up to date info, it is the only SWTOR reddit after all :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason why two years from now matters is that from a newbie perspective it is very easy to get the feeling that the game is at the end of its life now and that everybody and their dog is unsubbing after this last expansion. 

Being a newbie to the game also implies being a newbie to the community. If this naysaying is in fact typical of this community and thus do not actually represent the state of the game, then it is worthwhile investing time and energy in to the game. 

I don't want to level to max level and get attached to my characters, enjoy the game, only to find out the servers are shutting down next month. 

From a person new to this game, this is really the impression one gets from the community. People are either saying the game will die or wishing it does to spite BW (very weird to cut your nose off to spite your face :)) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the thorough reply. One definitely gets 'burned out' on MMOs after a couple of years with any one of them. Even though Legion is awesome, I had my fill of WoW over the last 5 years or so. 

Reading the forum and Reddit for SWTOR though provides a disproportionate feeling that this game must be the worst ever produced. I know I am only level 58 now but I am failing to see this in the game I am playing. There is so much story and reasons to do quests in SWTOR (very little quests are of the type "kill 10 of those or bring 15 of these type of typical MMO quests)

So yeah, my question is basically then, where is all this bad that everyone seems to want to cancel their subs over and despises BW for? Guess I need to get to end game progression to see it (not that that is where I necessarily want to go, more like casual raiding and RPing is where I see myself). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Safe" would be that the servers will still be up for a few years to come, and that there are people around to interact with, either by doing group content or RPing. 

I don't mind paying for the privilege of having access to entertainment I enjoy. Actually, I feel 'bad' playing with out subbing. Nothing in this world is free and if I get a couple of hours of joy and escapism from SWTOR a week then I want to pay the devs and people hosting the servers for providing me with the opportunity to do so. If I don't, how can I aspect them to continue to invest in the product so that I can still enjoy it with new content a few years from now?

I really like the SW IP and MMOs, and if this is as good as it  gets for SW at this point in time, then I really, really want SWTOR to succeed and be successful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all 

Why are there so many angry people with negative posts over here and on the official forums?

As a new player with an active subscription is it safe to start investing financially, emotionally and time wise in to this game?

Are these very vocal negative people in the minority and the game is actually doing OK at max level currently?

At this point I am level 58 and chapter 2 of the JK class story. Really enjoying it at this point in time. 

Played WoW for a couple of years and would like to do some laid back raiding in SWTOR as well.

I like reading about the games I play as well and tend to get attached to my characters. Apart from this sub Reddit and the official forums, where can I find a bit more of a positive community?

Is SWTOR the only SW IP MMO currently? </TEXT>

Anyway, download it and enjoy, try to stay away from the official forums and some posts on this Reddit sub forum though as it seems there a few extremely entitled toxic members in this community who have nothing positive to say about the game and is only wishing for its demise (very weird since they actually have an active subscription, because you need one to post on the official forums...).

I asume that these pieces on the GTN are from people who kept the items they got from the packs back in the day. Thus making the pieces very expensive due to their collectors status.

So my question is then actually, apart from the GTN and buying pieces people hoarded, are there any other means like playing the game, grinding and farming for them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all

Installed the game and currently level 44 Jedi Knight. Loving it :)

While I am waiting for the patch to download I was thinking of asking some of the questions I have about the game.

Firstly, I subscribed to the game as it seems like the fair thing to do, the devs spend time creating it and I am enjoying it. Also I do not like to play with restrictions as my play time is limited and I would rather not waste it on grinding gold or other resources, but actually playing.

The questions I have are:


1. I got some Cartel packs, in these packs were orange coloured armours without stats. Are these only for transmog? 

2. If I retrieve the item from my inbox item list and it becomes an item in my inventory, is that specific item only usable then on the character that retrieved it, or is it in your collection for any toon to create a copy off? If not, then I should be more careful to claim items on my JK I wont use due to RP / Lore reasons.

3. As a JK is it safe to romance Kira, I will not become a fallen JK for doing so and miss out on some JK specific quests / items? Like a fallen Paladin for instance loses his lay on hands abilities etc.

4. Is there any flying in the game, not in your spaceship but instead of hovering while travelling on a planet, actually take to the skies? 

5. Should I keep my initial light saber casing I got on Tython and only upgrade it with mods, or can I sell it and use the better ones I pick up from mobs?

6. Are there any cool robes for a JK like the ones Obi-Wan wears? If so, what are they called and how can one farm / craft them?


Thanks to anybody / everybody who takes the time to reply :)

	<TEXT> Yeah, I get that. For the story to progress you have to pushed along. What I was referring to (reading my post again not clearly though :) ) however is that for example a Jedi is somewhat 'forced' to act in certain way by the Jedi code. It won't make much sense (would be out of character and feel wrong) for a Jedi to make personal gain choices instead of helping others choices. Even if the option is presented in dialogue it would feel 'against' the Jedi Code to choose self gain over helping others. The other extreme would be to always have to choose the evil option.

So the question actually is then, which characters have the least restriction on the morality of their choices based on Star Wars cannon and lore? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New to the game, and have been thinking what type of character I want to create.

Which playable character combination answers only to him/her self?

I would think that this would be a trait linked to the dark side, but is it really so?

To be a Jedi, you need to follow the counsel as far as possible unless they give orders contradicting the Jedi code (killing of innocents for example).

So, if i want to play a character that truly does what it wants without answering to any one, would I need to play a Sith Warrior for example? Being a Sith Warrior does not imply being Chaotic Evil does it?


Edit:

I get that the game has to have some mechanism to progress the story and as such all characters have to be 'pushed' along and 'guided as to what to do next'

Brutal animations, sounds, herioc leap, shield slam, whirlwind even shouldering the enemy when you charge. 

Having your class hall in heaven drinking beer and feasting in between questing is great. </TEXT>

I had it at one stage, but lost it on my old account.

I could press 'z' if in normal form them if in a dungeon I change to a cat, out in the open into a bird and in Ashran into a stag. when pressed again it will put me back in boomkin form. </TEXT>
