	<TEXT> Guess I simply read it. Should have "read" it before I got all hypey. No matter, compared to the amount of words spent on other non-issues, he still spent too little time focusing on the games most unforgivable flaw. I stand on my previous level of disapproval. This guy is a hack. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some fair points, definitely. Some colossal diatribes against pressing start buttons and terrible hair, too.

I read the whole thing, waiting to see how he would dog Snakes molester mustache. Never happened. Not a mention.

Screw this guy. He was paying attention to jack shit.  He spent more time whimpering about textures and audio compression than he did on the weaker points of the story and gameplay. Admits that he played it like Gears of War, but can't understand why he didn't enjoy the experience. He spent a lot of time prefacing his rant with a nice rant-spoiler warmup too. 

Real wordy. Reads like he spent more time editing his article than playing the game he is pissing on.

...and not once did he bring up the tragedy growing out of Snakes upper lip. Boo! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure about the cartoons, but Dr. Morbius was a regular ol' scientist with some sort of blood disease who tries to cure himself with a bat of some sort and as one might guess, became a vampire. I recall seeing him run around with The Midnight Sons in the mid nineties, and hadn't given the character any thought until I saw this thread. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...kinda. Playing through at the moment, actually. Not as bad as I remember, but still my least favorite in the series. Kinda cool watching Snake kick ass in the third person, and Raiden isn't as horrible as I remember, but I can still gripe about Fat Man, Ray, Big Shell itself, Solidus and a few other things that I don't think are up to snuff. Fortune is awesome though. One of my favorite MGS characters. 

Also, WTF is with you pussies downvoting someone's conflicting opinion? Every time I talk about MGS2 here I get downvoted to oblivion. I get the impression that my words peirce your dry anuses with the ease of a 90mph cucumber. Sheesh! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah, you are experiencing the same shock I had as a day one player. Nothing about the Tanker chapter was too out of the ordinary, but when it switched to the Plant I was sitting around scratching my head just like you are now. Everyone was. This led to derision. I still kinda hate that game to this day because of it... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can vouch that it IS possible to S rank these missions solo. I've done all of em. Every single one. With no multiplayer assistance. Upgrading your missiles, carrying as much Fulton gear as possible, and utilizing the environment to remain out of sight is key. Also, after about 30 or so attempts at any of these, patterns emerge, once you can see and know what's gonna happen next, exploitation makes vehicle battles a snap.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care who directs a movie as long as its someone who directs Wayans Brothers films. And if the movie is to be perfect, it must star both Gilbert Gottfried and Melissa McCarthy.


So, I'm not too hard to please... 


Director: Malcom D. Lee (Scary Movie 5)


Solid Snake/Big Boss: Melissa McCarthy

Otacon/Huey: Gilbert Gottfried

To round out the cast, I suggest exclusive casting of the previously mentioned legends in all roles, augmented by practical makeup effects and mo-cap if necessary.

Also, if we could get the talented individual who pens the screenplays for Michael Bay's impeccably written and superbly edited Transformers films, MGS would surely become the franchise to topple Marvel at the box offfce. </TEXT>
