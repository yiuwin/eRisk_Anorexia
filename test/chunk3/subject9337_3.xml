	<TEXT> I think I'm a little bit of masochist, in that feeling very sad or ashamed or even mad makes me feel SOMETHING, and I can get a little bit of a high from it.  Also when you feel extreme negative emotions your brain will try to compensate by pumping out feelgood chemicals.  This may be where the "high" feeling comes from.  But I'm not a doctor, lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally associate being thin with my desire to be cared for.  I struggled with depression for SO LONG but no one really cared or noticed until I got very underweight.  I don't know if that's really cause for the ED or not but it's definitely something I've noticed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not very elitist about eating "healthy" and pretty much lived off lean cuisines for awhile.  My kitchen sucked and I hated cooking in it so microwave it was!  They're nice because you can get a little comfort food in a small serving.  If I save all my calories for dinner I will sometimes have 2 or 3 of them for variety.  The bags of vegetables with sauce and a lot of lean cuisines don't go over 250 calories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was major tomboy and actively rebelled against puberty.  Cried when I got my period, cried when my grandma not so subtly gifted me a razor at my 6th grade "graduation," cried when I got girly clothes as gifts and my mom made me wear them, lol.  My best friend was flat chested and didn't go through any sort of puberty until she was 15 and I was soooo jealous of her.  Grass is always greener though, she was pretty ticked off about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly if they are not specifically trained in dealing with ED's, I would not bother.  I made this mistake with a couple therapists and it just ends up being unbearably frustrating.  One of them even gave me the "men don't like bones," speech, and I was MARRIED at the time.  Didn't see her for too much longer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In elementary school I was one of the first girls to get boobs.  I hated it.  My mom bought me a training bra and I cried.  Nowadays they are so small I can pretty pass as flat chested in a sports bra.  They are kind of deflated from breast feeding but that's my only complaint.  Also breast feeding made me develop a total aversion to having them touched at all, so I guess the less to play with the better for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of "naturally thin" people who say that they eat whatever they want do not realize how little they are actually eating.  At my lowest weight I was eating "crap" too, just not very much of it, and it was all I was eating.  Like, I too can say "I eat whatever I want," and maybe all I wanted that day was a mini bag of m ms.  Honestly any genetic lottery they won probably has more to do with a predisposition to having a lower appetite.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a story about this.  I once admitted myself to the behavioral ward at the hospital for suicidal thoughts and self harm behaviors.  I told the dude who did my intake interview that I was struggling with disordered eating.  At this point I had lost close to 45 pounds in a short amount time, BUT I was still a healthy weight, albeit on the low end.  He completely dismissed my ED worries by saying, "Well your weight is fine."

Flashforward to a year later when I was admitted to the same place involuntary after I called 911 because I thought I was dying.  Basically my heart rate got really high for no reason.  I was terrified because I was on a new medication that had a side effect of possible heart problems.  They gave me an IV of potassium and magnesium or something and then sent me to the behavioral ward because of my weight and the self harm scars they saw when they did the ECG.  

That same guy was there that did my intake the last time, and I was able to have a heart to heart with him about how he shouldn't dismiss people's feelings about disordered eating just because they may be at a healthy weight.  You dont know where they came from or where they might go.  If anything he seemed genuinely sorry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't weighed myself in a while but i am starting to look sick, and I feel guilty about being happy about that.  My ex starting talking to me again last night after basically telling me never to contact him again.  He is going to pretend we never broke up again.  Tomorrow I have to spend the day with my ex husband who I haven't really spent any time with in 10 months.  It's the one day a year we have to see each other I suppose - our son's birthday.  I just want to disappear.  I can't because I have a child.  Dont fuck up and get pregnant at 18, kids. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, welcome.  I'm new in here too and also in my late 20's.  Nice to know there are people around my age that still go through this.  I was diagnosed at 24 and the people who knew what was going on were always kind of like, "I thought that was a teenager disease." -_-

Sorry about what you're currently going through but grats on the wedding. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got dumped two days ago in a pretty horrible way.  I think it was my depression that ultimately ruined it, though he has a lot of issues himself.  He's semi famous online so it's very easy for me to torture myself by continuing to watch him/follow him on various social media.

Totally hear you about the appetite thing.  Yesterday I had to stop eating the little I forced myself to eat because I was crying too hard.  Not too much is keeping me from offing myself anymore.  I guess there might be a couple people that would rather I be alive, but I'm finding it harder and harder to care.

2 major breakups in under a year.  After the first one I lost about 15 pounds fairly quickly.  Wonder what will happen this time. </TEXT>
