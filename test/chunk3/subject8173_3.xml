	<TEXT> Former WWE World Heavyweight champion Daniel Bryan was backstage at the WWE NXT TV last night, PWInsider.com has confirmed.  Bryan was visiting with the roster and watched the majority of the show from the gorilla position backstage.

It was the first time Bryan has been in attendance at a WWE event since retiring live on Raw on 2/8 in Seattle. 

Bryan had been advertised since then for appearances at several live events that would have featured a "Daniel Bryan Appreciation Night" theme as well as a signing at Wrestlemania AXXESS, but was pulled from those dates at his request just as they were about to begin.  At the time, WWE's comment was that Bryan had been given "requested time off."

Bryan's visit backstage also allowed him a chance to reunite with EVOLVE's Gabe Sapolsky, who was also at the taping.  The two worked very closely together during their time in Ring of Honor and the original incarnation of EVOLVE was the brain-child of the pair.

Bryan will be taking part in the E! reality series "Total Bellas" this fall, featuring himself and Brie Bella moving into John Cena's home in Tampa, helping Nikki Bella recover from neck surgery.  Bryan's retirement and life after wrestling will be featured on the show.

Bryan's social media shows that while in Florida, he took part in a workout at the WWE Performance Center. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> RoH Supercard of Honor VII in New York for Wrestlemania weekend. We actually had tickets, got there late, had terrible seats where we couldn't see anything thanks to a lighting rig. I was down for standing the whole time somewhere else... The girlfriend, not so much. Got in a fight with her and then decided to give up the ghost. Jay Briscoe wins title and I get pretty depressed I missed out on someone I've watched for 11 years win a title that rarely changes hands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What actually should be done is instead of running a split crew every weekend for house shows they should run one crew and give the weekend off to the others, and then do the opposite crew the next week. That way you only work every other weekend and every Monday and Tuesday. That alone would take a good amount off on people's bodies. </TEXT>

To everyone working this show and who has in the past thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He left immediately after they cut the camera away. Shook hands with fans on the way back.

I'll be there again tomorrow as well. Have fun guys, should be a pretty killer show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Karl Anderson and Doc Gallows - The Bullet Club - are scheduled to be at this week's WWE TV Tapings, PWInsider.com has confirmed with multiple sources.  It''s expected they will be at Wrestlemania, at least backstage at the event, as well. 

As we had reported previously, the pair were expected to debut on the main WWE roster, bypassing NXT, in late March/early April.  It appears their debut is imminent.

The belief is that the team will be using The Balor Club name. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah that's what I'm saying. That place isn't run like any kind of television writing room. Even on TV you have a show runner who has final say as far as direction, but they give you the freedom of finding your own way there.

It's tough and demoralizing when you think you have a good idea and something that can tell a great story and then someone just shits on it and you can't even argue your case.

I'll give HHH credit though because the team he has working on NXT is a lot better at overall storytelling then what the main roster has. My best comparison is main roster stories are more like your broadcast network shows. NXT is more akin to your basic cable writing, which I think is just easier to digest in the current world we live in where people are looking for more depth in getting from point A to point B in a story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They need to stop looking for people with actual experience in TV and film writing... It's a whole different beast to write wrestling storylines. I get that the experience can keep things tidy or whatever, but they need people who care about wrestling and have a true passion for the actual art of wrestling. I don't need rehashed sitcom storylines from every broadcast network. You can find someone who has great ideas for wrestling and mold them into a neat and tidy writer. Start out being an idea person and work with someone who can write and edit for you and then after 6 months you're free to format for yourself. On the job training.

Or just find me the new Chris Kreski and all will be forgiven. </TEXT>
