	<TEXT> His original contract was 9.6 mil with 4.2 mil guaranteed. There's no way he gets 10 mil at age 32. I'm ok with 2 year 7.2 based 5 mil signing bonus...or something like that.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd pass on Williams and keep smith, especially for a team friendly contact.  Is no one else excited to see Von get the franchise tag? That's a strong inclination that Jackson is on his way out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correct! There's now only one sports station and that's literally all they talk about. The day before the 2nd bronco game Terry Frye said we would lose to them 33-10. That's pretty telling of the homerism displayed here by the sports radio commentary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On bronco radio yesterday there was a lot talks about Nkemidche falling to them. It would be awesome to steal him away. I think that is more possible if we don't score Malik Jackson. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've watched most of the donkey's game and this guy is worth it. The guy is super athletic. Slimmer than jelly and Williams. Comes up with big sacks when needed. He would be a great addition. I want him and sean smith on the team next year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn the NFL! I was looking forward to the 11 MST game start in CO. Now the broncos will be playing at the same time. So no raider game here.  To the bar! </TEXT>
