	<TITLE> PSA: Fellow Globe subscribers, Do not register Prepaid promos until they're done with thier system upgrade. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-08 06:57:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I registered for 500 minutes of Globe to Globe calls and 250 Globe to Globe texts for 30 days worth 259php last night then next day I got a notification from them that my promo got expired.

http://imgur.com/a/sjikL

I tried calling their hotline through to their prepaid department and no one was answering. I tweeted them and they haven't responded yet. Then I checked their Twitter page and this is the [info](https://twitter.com/enjoyGLOBE/status/706791285491834880) that I got. Also I checked Globe's mentions via Twitter's search bar by searching [@enjoyGlobe](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets vertical=default q=%40enjoyGlobe src=typd)   [@talk2Globe](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets vertical=default q=%40talk2Globe src=typd), it appears that plenty of people are experiencing the same problem.

So Globe subscribers, do not register any Prepaid promos until they're done with their system upgrade.

EDIT: I went to a Globe Store and got my load back.  </TEXT>

From Walter Mart, Pasong Tamo, go straight towards Shopwise Makati (going to the Manila horse race track) then turn right at Bagtikan, left at Guijo. Red building to the right at the corner of Sacred Heart St.

From Jupiter St. Makati, go straight towards Mapua, turn left at Sacred Heart St., its the red building to the right at the corner of Guijo st.

Alternatively, you can just follow Waze. Just type Dug-out Kitchen   Tap. This was our restobar name before we closed. My brother used to hold poker nights, acoustic nights and functions here. It's now just a conference/meeting area so thought it was a good open space for the tourney.

Take a bus going to Pasong Tamo (there's definitely one in Cubao). Take a trike to the venue. Tell them to Bagtikan then there, turn left to Guijo. Red building to the right at the corner of Sacred Heart St.

	<TEXT> Do you think the netcode in Splatoon is as good as Mario Kart 8's online race? I live in the Philippines and unfortunately our ISPs are the worst. Mario Kart 8 online races works fine here. Smash 4 Online has input delays to uber lag except if my opponent/sparring partner is in the same country with the same ISP then it works perfectly. If this game has a similar netcode as Mario Kart 8 then I'll buy the game in an instant. </TEXT>
