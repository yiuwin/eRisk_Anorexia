	<TEXT> My thought process on this was when he mentioned some people just aren't interested in that sort of D D dynamic. So maybe one character cares more about legacy weapons while another is just interested in some nifty magic wands or something. 

I imagine it depends on group dynamic but I was wondering what his experience has been.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is really cool! I have a couple of questions, as I've introduced some minor magic items in my campaign that could end up being cool legacy weapons. 

* How do you manage a player wanting to fulfill their weapon's legacy quest, possibly at the expense of other players not being able to fulfill theirs at the same time? My assumption is you would have the quests/goals overlap somehow, but I'm wondering how you'd handle it.

* Does every character get one if they seem interested? Have you found that one player having one and others not having them causes problems?

* Are you worried about them causing any level of OPness? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the *main* issue is that the film basically sends the message that cheaters end up alone and with HIV. Which is a pretty shit message. 

Some more minor silly things exist. Like the woman, who admittedly was in the wrong for having an affair, was doing so to improve her life. She was unhappy and just tried to fix it in a bad way. But then her whole church circle and family gathers around her to tell her she is wrong for wanting to be happy basically. Then the dude ends being an abusive POS?

It's just kind of silly and dumb. It takes away any semblance of adult themes. Yes cheating is wrong, but it doesn't end up with some poor woman being abused and having HIV.  </TEXT>

The way OP repeatedly says "I don't know what you are talking about." is a huge red flag. In fact, I call bullshit OP. Faked or not, he is up to something here. Possibly the "voice of reason" that comes in to show how wrong we were as per the "black propaganda" theory.

	<TEXT>  1  The characters soul possesses an object at death, maybe one of the magic items in the party or something of important to them. The player will still need to Roll up a new character, but it leaves the essence of the previous character still in the game; and the player can choose to still have his/her old character Role Play dialogue from the item if they want.

This is an incredibly interesting one. Doesn't this give a player basically two characters (one a hero and the other a weapon) to make decisions with?

I would love to hear some people who have tried this. It's cool.

Set in 2024, Logan and Professor Charles Xavier must cope with the loss of the X-Men at the hands of a corporation led by Nathaniel Essex.

	<TEXT> Yep exactly. I practice bodybuilding and I've found that fit people are constantly concerned with how they look. I remember a few years ago I had gone like 6 months without chocolate, and then I ate a chocolate bar, and I immediately felt like I looked grosser when looking in the mirror.

On the other hand, I talk to overweight friends and I would say its 50/50 where some care but don't know how to fix it, and others just simple aren't concerned.

So yeah you're right on point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The synopsis is: 

One year after the events of X-Men: Days of Future Past, Logan has aged over the years making the promise not to use his claws for bloody purposes, with his healing factor weakened. When an evil organization lead by Nathaniel Essex tries to use the rest of the remaining mutants in the world, turning them into weapons, Logan will need to become the Wolverine one more time.

So I imagine that this is one year after the fixed timeline. So he comes back, sees everyone safe in a new future where Jean and Scott are alive, etc., and this is one year from then. I think. 

EDIT: Wikipedia seems to be in a constant edit. It now reads:

Set in 2024, Logan and Professor Charles Xavier must cope with the loss of the X-Men at the hands of a corporation led by Nathaniel Essex. With Logan's healing abilities slowly fading and Xavier's Alzheimer's hampering his memory, Logan must defeat Essex with the help of a young girl named Laura Kinney, a female clone of Wolverine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check her post history. She is, if I'm not mistaken, a doctor astronomy student. She's posted pics of herself before. I think one was of her in a galaxy themed dress? I could be wrong. It's been a while and my memory is shit.

Her contributions are always awesome and well informed though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think they've been legitimately trying to push him out. The RNC is a company and like any organization it understands that if they removed Trump they would be hard pressed to find someone, that at this point, has a better chance of defeating Hilary.

So while many of the GOP: RNC may not always like what he is doing and some of the other members may even call him out, he is their best hope for the time being of seeing a Republic president.

So yes he could be "fired" or removed, but that isn't in their best interest probably.  </TEXT>

That does not sound like a person I want to hang out with tbh. Nothing wrong with the occasional white lie.

Wow that was so unnecessarily harsh. This whole thread is full of cringe:

Why do women ACTUALLY believe men want them as friends? Bitch, if I'm talking to you I probably want to fuck you and don't even feel special because it's probably cause I can't do any better so I go for a fat disgusting cow. No one actually wants women as friends. Women are delusional about this part just as neckbeards are delusional about love. </TEXT>

Any scholarly proof for that?

I meant scholars.

You haven't posted scholarly work for anything you've said, so why should I?

I really don't think this guy understands the way academics, aka scholarly studies, works. 

I haven't proven Obama isn't a lizard-man, either. You also haven't proven anything
