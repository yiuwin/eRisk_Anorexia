	<TEXT> To be fair we've only seen Mickey with his children when they were adults. We have an idea of the abuse inflicted upon them based on what's been discussed. With Frank we're seeing the children grow up in real time. Therefore the abuse with him probably looks worse. 

Interesting they're both Irish Catholic. Was that the same for Frank in the original UK version of Shameless? </TEXT>

Based on what Gordon said, MacMillan's antivirus software would remedy only an attack carried out by the Sonaris virus, which seems like a highly unlikely scenario. If that is the case, what does the software do to actually protect the user?

I suspect Joe is planning on, if not already creating the virus (or viruses) that his own anti-virus software will neutralize thus ensuring his product is both necessary and successful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same thing was predicted when Dominion (now Metro) opened up across the street from the St. Lawrence Market (SLM) many years ago. 

It was suggested at the time that some of the items in the grocery store, like canned goods would complement what shoppers were buying at the SLM meaning they would go to the grocery store in addition to the SLM rather than instead of.

Not sure if this is what happened but both seem to be doing fine.  </TEXT>

Source: http://westwing.wikia.com/wiki/Mandyville

According to the West Wing Wiki, "She left the show after the first season after deciding with producer Aaron Sorkin that her character had played its story out and that Janel Moloney served as a better foil for Bradley Whitford. Her character was not mentioned on the show again, leading to the term Mandyville"

I believe all the clones are in their late 20s / early thirties. As for Cos still being in school it's 100% believable: she's working towards a PhD, which take anywhere from 6 to 15 (or more!) years to complete. 

If it takes someone 15 years to get a PhD they're not doing it right. You would likely be asked to leave at that point. Most programs provide funding for four years with the possibility of extending that from other sources for one or two more.

If she's, let's say, 18 at the start of college, factor in minimum of 4 years for a Bachelor's, 2 for a Master's (it's almost impossible to get into a science based PhD program without one) - that's already 24. 

Many PhD science programs accept you right from undergrad. If you do well enough in your courses and devise a good enough research proposal you're allowed to continue on. If not you bow out gracefully with a master's. But it's pretty useless as everyone in your field knows you couldn't cut it and you can't use it to continue in academia.

In the sciences after your complete PhD you need to do at least one if not more post docs as well.

Not sure why they failed so badly at communicating this.

Not sure either. It wasn't listed on my on-screen tv guide, which is updated daily. 

Maybe it was a last minute idea. If so, I'm not sure if this bodes well for the show in terms of how the network feels about it. 

Trying to create buzz by releasing it early but failing to give enough advance notice for most to have caught it.

Interesting. Would like to hear back from anyone that checks these out.

I have a few loaded on my GPS and will report back. Would be fun if I ran into other fans of the show while tracking down the caches. 

BTW, I live near where the show films and walk past the exterior location for the police station quite often. Always think about Art and (Sarah as) Beth from Season 1! </TEXT>

Disagree that Mickey is bringing things down, or a "weak plot device," (though you might have a point, but I feel like their evolving relationship is one of the good things they have going. I mean the first scene of the show was Mickey leaving prison, so I think we're supposed to see their relationship as changing it all up.) But I completely agree with everything else you said. Didn't know about the showrunners change. Wonder why they did that? 

I'm guessing "creative differences". I think Amy had a vision for the show (it was her idea as I understand it) and someone else thought otherwise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure the change in tone is a result of Ann Biderman leaving after the second season. She was also the showrunner for Southland, which is an excellent show BTW (you'll be hooked just by the opening credits). I purposely watched Ray Donovan because Amy was the showrunner. I thought it was going to be so much different.

I don't know what happened behind the scenes regarding her departure but the show has deteriorated since then in my opinion. 

I've posted here before that the early buzz around the show, especially before it aired was that Ray was a Hollywood fixer and it was that the storylines were to focus on that. I don't even recall the family being mentioned. I had the impression that Lena and Avi would get way more screen time and character development. I think the most we've got about Lena so far in any one episode for the entire series run was shown in the pilot. There was a bit more over season 1 but that's about it. Four seasons in and we still don't know the cause of her anger issues. I'm curious as to how Avi and Lena came to work for Ray. That to me is way more interesting than the stuff about the family. 

Frankly I thought it was a very weak plot device to bring in Ray's father. This is probably an unpopular opinion around here but I think the Mickey character is a joke.  Lazy writing. Jon Voight is excellent in his portrayal but I don't like any of his storylines. In my opinion they take away from the intended purpose of the show - the arc of Ray Donovan. What have we learned about Ray from Mickey that hasn't been portrayed many times over in different shows? A guy who had a bad father grows up to have jerk tendencies himself. 

I do want to find out what happened to the sister Bridget though. Maybe just because that's been dragging on for 4 seasons! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may want to review the rules about uploading datasets from other sources found here:

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines#Make_sure_data_license_is_OK

In particular these parts:

Step 2 - Community Buy-in

It is recommended that before any actual work is performed on the import that contact is made with the community to see if there is interest in importing the data. Different geographic areas in OSM have different acceptance levels for imports. The exact same kind of data set might be welcomed in one area and be rejected in another.

Discuss your plan. Email the OSM community to notify them of your plans, including a link to your wiki page. You can do this with an email to (at a minimum) imports@openstreetmap.org, talk-(your country)@openstreetmap.org, and the OSM group specific to the area directly impacted by the import (note that you must join the lists at http://lists.openstreetmap.org/ before mailing to them). This will help gain the benefit of past experiences, which may include having already reviewed the data you're considering for import. Check for local user groups, local chapters, and country-specific mailing lists.

Be prepared to answer questions from the community. Discuss with the community the suitability of each layer for importing. Some data can be readily imported without much difficulty, while others are far more difficult (e.g. street centerlines). Also some are broadly accepted for import, while others haven't had much consensus (e.g. parcel boundaries).

More complex and large-scale imports should be reviewed with the assistance of more technically-oriented and experienced OSM volunteers.

You must not import the data without local buy-in.

	<TEXT> Has anyone tried to use JOSM on a 2 in 1 tablet yet? 

I would think using a stylus would greatly improve some tasks like adding buildings. However, you would need to bring up the on-screen keyboard to type details into your changelog before uploading.

JOSM can be very keystroke-dependent depending on how you use it. I've learned to do as many tasks as possible with a mouse. I'm assuming the stylus used in a 2 in 1 will have mouse click options. </TEXT>

I believe if you download Go Map!! you can make notes and see all the notes at least you have made. Im pretty sure you cannot see other people's though.

I use Go Map! You can both see and contribute notes. It can be turned on in the options. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't understand this show at all.

When it was first released it was advertised as a show about Ray Donovan, a man who fixes Hollywood rich people's problems. Here's the description from the Showtime web site:

"Set in the sprawling mecca of the rich and famous, Ray Donovan does the dirty work for LA's top power players. The one-hour series stars Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominee Liev Schreiber in his first lead television role as the go-to guy who makes the problems of the city's celebrities, superstar athletes, and business moguls disappear. This powerful drama unfolds when his father, played by Oscar winner Jon Voight, is unexpectedly released from prison, setting off a chain of events that shakes the Donovan family to its core"

I thought that was the focus with some minor storylines about the family. The first few episodes in season 1 seemed to be going that way. Then it started to be more and more about the family I think around when Mickey showed up. I guess we could argue that there has been at least one "celebrity, superstar athlete, and business mogul" each season. I thought there was going to be one each episode.

Does anyone think this is why Amy Biderman left?

This is not what I signed up for!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's great too!

I like the different viewing angles. Modern day tanks are like televisions - basically made to be looked at from only from one angle in one place in a room. 

Also this kind of gives off a steam punk vibe. It's like something you'd see on the Nautilus from "20,000 Leagues under the Sea". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that's pretty much the consensus. 

Orphan Black's production didn't lock down Evelyne with a contract so she was free to go elsewhere. And she took the lead in "X Company" as well as some film projects. 

To be fair the contract business was probably being worked on at the beginning of season 2 before the audience interest in Cosima/Delphine really took off. 

I guess it's a risk production teams have to take all the time as they don't really know what aspects of a show are going to become fan favourites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Cosima's arc was her relationship with Delphine. Amongst this great mix of clones with varying degrees of edgy roughness (yes, even Alison if you think about it) Cosima was chosen to portray the "epic romance" of the series. As a result her storyline and character arc seems less obvious, especially when compared to the others.

edit: changed Rachel for Alison </TEXT>
