	<TEXT> As far as I remember, near kakariko or hateno. Usually from chopping grass. Or under rocks, sometimes clinging to the side of trees. They are hightail lizards and only needed for the 2nd uograde. Sadly you need 15 in total. You can always look in the travelling merchants too, he sometimes has a few. 
If you spot one, take a picture and trying using the upgraded sheikh sensor to find them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try to shoot in the face with arrows. That's how I go about killing all Lynels. It stuns them so you can jump on there backs and swing your weapon away. Sometimes I miss with the arrows so I dodge or run, depending what he attacks with next.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First thing I did was climb every tower. Get max stamina (or stamina recovery potions), climbing gear upgraded twice helps a lot too) and climb everything until you spot a tower, pin it and make your way too it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's pretty nice but damage boosts don't matter too much when you one hit them with arrows or reflect there beams at them. 
I understand your pov, but for me it doesn't really matter. 
But damage boosts against everything? Like Lynels? That's just with ancient armor?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even if you move to collect arrows, keep the view like a birds eye view. If you keep getting hit, try using revalis gale and move. Or maybe you have too many enemy's around. I did it with only 3 enemies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a few areas to do this but what you need is enemies on horse back that shoot arrows. Paraglide to them and land with the camera pointing down at Link. Don't move the camera. Arrows will fly at you but you won't get hit. Pick up all arrows around you until you have max (999).

Also, north of skull lake there is an enemy encampment that fires bomb arrows. As long as it is raining hard, you can farm bomb arrows there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't share this POV either.. It's a LoZ game. That's how they are. It just goes back to before you beat them. If it didn't, there would be no more monsters or blood moons. You'd basically be playing just to talk to people. </TEXT>
