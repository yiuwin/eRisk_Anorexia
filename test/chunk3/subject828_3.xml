	<TEXT> Jeez guys, you're missing the big picture here! Even OP missed it in an ironic way. 

If Centurion had a scutum we would not have this glorious meme of the mercy sentencing! His Roman thumb woild be much too occupied. 

Keeping knights as memelords is paramount to game balance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are no Kills, there are Takedowns. If you assist or kill someone solo it counts as Takedown. But the heavy killing blow will only do execution. So assisting helps your score. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So just because side step light attacks don't work it instantly means that the Conq is unbeatable by that class? Come on. Every hero requires different tactics. Just because this one doesn't work doesn't mean that it's impossible and OP. Orochi and Berserker are fast. Conqueror can't Feint. Parry his attacks, don't feed into the defense. Honestly, using feints works wonders. If he uses Full Stance the Superior Block doesn't apply so combos can still work. Some of the best fights I've had were from more mobile heroes juking me and using feints. Like one thing you can try to do is bait a parry and since he can't feint to cancel it you parry the wide open heavy swing for a GB. Worst that happens there is he charges a swing and you can GB during the charge up. Get him to open up the defense is the trick.

Conq is slow, telegraphed, and doesn't have many moves. His advantage is the good defense. Devalue that by exploiting those weaknesses. </TEXT>
