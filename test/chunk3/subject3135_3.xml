	<TEXT> When I was volunteering in Thailand last year, the country was placed under martial law and then the armed forces launched a coup. During that time, the country was placed under a curfew. Several days after the curfew was announced during the weekend, a group of us, including Thai and Western volunteers, were visiting a local city where there was a heavy military presence. Several drinks were consumed and before we know it, we're racing back to base to avoid being out after curfew. We had to go through several road blocks with the Thai volunteers hiding under blankets so that the military just sees a bunch of white tourists driving around. It was incredibly scary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I liked this episode much better than the previous one, but I'm just not crazy about the story arcs they have right now. I miss Petra's crazy mom, and Rose, and all the shocking twists! I mean, how many times can we see Jane and Rafael fight/disagree in their relationship or Michael mope about Jane before it gets boring? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I always see comments on this sub about how when Ray was first introduced that they couldn't see anyone else but Shaw from Chuck. I mean, people had such intense reactions to him and I never understood it. He's just the bad guy in another show, right?

Well, I'm finally going to understand. I'm about to start season 3 of Chuck and I'm excited! Arrow is the first time I've ever seen Brandon Routh act and all I know him as is Ray Palmer/A.T.O.M./Olicity crusher. I've never seen him Chuck or Superman or anything else. It's going to be interesting having such a different take on this that I just wanted to share! </TEXT>
