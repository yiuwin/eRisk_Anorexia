	<TEXT> Plastic surgery is a friend. It's amazingly high tech and does wonders for self esteem. In my opinion anyone can be at least a five if they have good hygiene, put forth effort in their appearance, and take care of the self. So if you dress nice, take showers, and lead a healthy lifestyle then I think you can't be ugly per se, but maybe I'm a bit much of an optimist


edit : and by healthy I mean like... trying your best to not live off junk food. I think we're all here because we can't really be healthy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to see NYC one day. One day, I want to be a good person and I want to be pure. I want someone who will think well of me and remember me fondly, but will also recognize that I'm fleeting and not miss me. Not to sound cliche </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome! This is so relatable. Back when I was 10/11, I hit puberty before most of my friends. I had the big boobs, the fuller figure, and I was taller. When I hit 100lb at age 11, my friends all jokingly called me fat because they knew it bothered me and I know it was just for laughs but it was miserable. Now, though, I've stopped getting taller and my chest is super flat compared to all of my friends lol. But I feel like hitting puberty early really did a spell on my self esteem and body image.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if this is my melodrama talking or nah but I'm almost certain I've gone over 5000 cal in a day from binging. My HW was 130 but that was before my ED when my metabolism began to slow down and I started losing baby chub and had to make major diet changes to get to around 120lb when I was 13. My lowest weight was 105lb and I had multiple binges a month that I'm sure we're around 5000 cal (though I may be over exaggerating im not sure) Oh and I'm 5'4. :) I felt disgusting at the time, but in hindsight I don't regret it really. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SAME. I joke about it with my bf too but little does he know I'm pretty sure I'm addicted. In all honesty it's not because it reacts like a laxative (in fact for months I was experiencing that awful side effect with miserable bloating without knowing why before I realized it was the gun) or because I chew it to suppress appetite it just... it tastes good lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Been chewing sugar free gum all day excessively--that stuff makes me sick as a dog; as in, I've eaten it enough for it to have the laxative effect on me at some point. Then just had a huge binge. Why do I do these things to myself? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because of the artificial sweetener! I don't know if it's as strong with other people, but sorbitol specifically makes me so sick. It's because artificial sweeteners aren't natural so your body has issues digesting them therefore making you sick. Be careful though, it's really easy to get addicted to gum. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Black definitely! Its just a very comforting taste to me. If I want something sweet I'll put some soy milk or almond milk in my coffee and sweeten it with stevia or honey. </TEXT>
