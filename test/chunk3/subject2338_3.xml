	<TEXT> I think Stress. I was already eating vegan, and my list of 'safe foods' was already VERY limited,so I quickly eliminated more and more foods from my diet.
Eventually I was down to like 400 calories a day, drinking only coffee, half a cup of grapes for lunch and a protein bar for dinner. I was working out a few hours a day as well. I was exhausted! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alrighty,so I was originally enrolled at Montana State in the fall of 2013,as an incoming Freshman. I've been anorexic since I was 13 or 14,but as of 2012,I have really struggled. My weight hasn't been above 100 pounds for over 2 years,and I'm 5'6". Academically,I was kicking ass. I was getting straight As,I was doing literally everything right. Until I started losing weight.

I went from 93 pound to 90 pounds on Move in day alone,and then within a month,I weighed 84 pounds,my lowest weight ever. I withdrew from classes,moved home and began an intensive outpatient program. My weight went up to 100 pounds for like a week,and I'm now back down to 93 pounds. I fully expect to relapse again,as it's just my response to being busy or stressed.

I return to college for summer classes in a month,and I REALLY need to stay in school. I'm smart enough,I can balance my time well enough,socially,I'm typically pretty popular and I've never struggled with guys or anything like that,but this damn eating disorder is the only thing holding me back. So does anyone have any advice,or previous experiences similar to mine? Thanks!

	<TEXT> Alrighty,so I'm currently living in Billings,but I have lived in Bozeman for a year or so,before going back home to Billings. I'm going to be taking summer courses and living on campus over the summer,and then going to school in the fall as well. I have experience working in a four star restaurant/hotel as a server/hostess/busser,and I have a few years experience working in retail/customer service as well. I would LOVE to work in a bar/restaurant, but I don't know too many,and until I'm living in Bozeman full time,I have to travel from Billings to do job hunting. Do you have ideas or suggestions for where I should apply? Thanks!

	<TITLE> What would you "do over" in college? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Okay,so this past fall semester I was forced to drop out in mid October. My grades were straight As,but my anorexia took over,and my weight dropped to 80 pounds,and I'm 5"6'. It was bad,but I learned a LOT and I'm excited to go back to school this next fall. I'm looking forward to a "do over" with my college experience. 

I'm going to go to school single this time around,have fun,chill the fuck out,party once in a while,eat more and just mellow out. 
If you could have a "do over" in college,what would you do differently? </TEXT>
