	<TEXT> Who has a suit just readily available such as palpatine in episode 3? Couldn't it be possible that he had planned for anakin to be badly injured so as to need a suit like that? Or could he have had an apprentice before him and he had died so the suit couldn't be used? It just doesn't make sense he had one ready to go, fitting perfectly?  </TEXT>
