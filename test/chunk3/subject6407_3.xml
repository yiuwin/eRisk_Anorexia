	<TEXT> Hi guys,

So I am a community college student from the SF Bay Area planning to transfer obtain an undergrad degree in math. I plan on going to grad school for either more math, cs, physics, or even an MBA. My dream school is UC Berkeley because of location and their STEM curriculum is awesome. It is possible, but unlikely I will be able to make this a reality because my parents want me out of community college ASAP, and with a D+ (leaving me with a 3.0 GPA) for one class from fall 2016, Academic Renewal will process a semester past Berkeley's application deadline. SO this means that if I want to apply  this fall to transfer to a university; it will likely be that I will transfer SJSU, UCD, or SFSU. My concern is that if I go to one of these schools, then I have a near 0% chance of making it into UCB, Stanford, Harvard, or any prestige university for grad school. Would that be a true statement?
