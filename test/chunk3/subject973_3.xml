We need to buy someone and the board won't spend, so Wenger has to make them willing to spend. He can't just roll over and take what he's given. What I don't like is how negative he is. We're only 1 game in, there's plenty of time to turn it around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Due to his versatility I think he'll end up playing whatever position someone who is injured normally plays.  If Ozil (god forbid) picks up an injury then he'll slot in at the number 10, if Ramsey or Xhaka get injured, he could play the deeper role alongside Elneny or Coq.  Hell, we could even see him on the wing if we get that many injuries (and we all know, chances are it will get bad).  </TEXT>

No, even better imagine choosing to leave a title winning team who has been very successful in the Champions League over the past few seasons to play in the Europa league...
