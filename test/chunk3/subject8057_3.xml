Pesticide is safe when it is used appropriately. The amount of pesticide we ingest via food is harmless because it is simply very small.

The acute oral LD50 of glysophate in rats is 5,600 mg/kg. So for a 70 kg human, that'd be about 392 g of glysophate. You could probably drink a cup of glysophate without dying.

	<TEXT>  The stats are from the US Census Bureau.

You're wrong. The numbers are the CPI (consumer price index) and they're from the BLS (the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The problem is that the CPI is a shitty measure of inflation, it was never designed for cross-decade inflation comparisons (it is calculated on a monthly and yearly basis), it overestimates inflation, it is higher than other inflationary indicies (as noted), ect.

The IPD is the implicit price deflator, which is another calculation of inflation which is done by the [US Bureau of Economic Analysis,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Economic_Analysis) which is another US government agency. It is the measure of inflation which is used in the calculation of the increase in productivity rates.

If you don't know that there's multiple inflationary indices which are calculated in different ways and give different results, you don't know enough about the subject matter to argue about it.

None of the inflationary indicies were ever designed for cross-decade comparisons, but people (improperly) apply them for such purposes all the time.

Inflation is not one number. Inflation is calculated by taking equivalent bundles of goods (basically, a set of goods) and looking at their prices in different years. Depending on what your bundle of goods is, you end up with different results.

The problem is that goods don't stay the same over time. A bag of rice is a bag of rice, but a car isn't a car - a 1970 car and a 2017 car are not the same thing. The 2017 car is much better.

This makes doing inflationary calculations extremely difficult, because you're no longer comparing like to like. You need to be comparing equivalent goods, but a good which is much better than another good is not equivalent, it is better. This sort of quality differential is very difficult to deal with.

On a month to month or even a year to year basis, the quality of goods don't change all that much, generally speaking. But on a decade to decade basis, the quality of goods changes considerably in many cases and not at all in others.

 Or do you honestly think that those amounts represent a doubling if we were to calculate inflation?

Median household income doubled between 1990 and 2017 in nominal terms. Median household income in 1990 was $28,680/year. In the most recent year available, 2015, it was $56,516. And there's some debate over whether or not median household income is itself systematically underestimated, but that's a whole different kettle of fish.

It also doesn't include non-income compensation, such as insurance provided by an employer, or payments to pension plans which don't pay off until the future. Notably, non-wage benefits have been increasing over time faster than wages have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Real estate prices have gone up, [though it is extremely non-uniform.](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/08/daily-chart-20) We're also entering into yet another housing bubble, unfortunately (you can see it pretty clearly from the graph - a number of cities saw sharp peaks, and then a big trough, and now it is going up towards another peak again), so that will be fun in about five years.

Unfortunately, a lot of that is due to scarcity in big cities, along with shitty regulations and anti-growth people creating a housing shortage in some areas, as well as speculation (again). Real estate prices outside of big cities haven't gone up by nearly as much.

That said, a big chunk of it is also improved housing. Houses today are about 1000 square feet larger than they were in 1973, the first year we started measuring the size of houses in a systemic way. They also have better amenities - internet, air conditioning (which is a recent thing - most people in general didn't have AC back in the 1970s. Today, even most poor people do), better appliances, ect.

Inflation is real, but the problem is that the popular conception of inflation is wrong and measures like the CPI overestimate inflation, especially in the long term.

But really a big part of it is just that CPI isn't designed to measure long-term inflation in the first place; it is a monthly and yearly measure. The census bureau shouldn't present cross-decade CPI numbers as if they're meaningful, because the measure was never designed for such purposes and isn't calculated across decades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly, there's not even evidence that it really is efficacious beyond placebo. No proper controlled studies have ever been done on the efficacy of SRS; obviously placebo trials are impossible, but there's not even been randomized ones. SRS was adopted without any actual testing of whether or not it helped people's psychological state.

Some long-term studies indicate that it may also have some significant placebo factor, as the suicide rate goes up years after the surgery, which is consistent with at least a portion of the effect being a result of the placebo effect and it wears off.

Indeed, we don't even know if post-op transgendered people have lower suicide rates relative to people who don't undergo the surgery. It has never been studied in any sort of systemic fashion.

We do know that post-op transgendred people have higher suicide rates than the public in general, but... well, not surprising. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is really misleading.

The reason why homosexuality was delisted as a mental illness is because homosexuality, in and of itself, doesn't cause problems.

FYI, gender dysphoria is the same way - being trans is not a mental illness in and of itself. However, if being trans causes you distress - if your gender identity not matching up with your physical gender bothers you - then you are mentally ill and are suffering from gender dysphoria.

This isn't really hard to understand.

Just because you're crazy doesn't mean you're mentally ill. Otherwise all religious people would be classified as mentally ill.

Mental illness only applies if it is causing you problems.

Someone can believe they're a dragon or that bread is Jewflesh and be fine as long as it isn't causing them problems. </TEXT>

The science is quite clear - the greatest risk factor for diabetes is obesity.

In fact, there's no evidence that insulin spikes are related to the development of diabetes at all that I've seen. All I've seen are obsevational studies which say "well, if you look at the general population, people who eat large amounts of high glycemic index foods tend to more likely to develop diabetes", but the problem is that this correlates strongly with obesity - it isn't an independent correlation.

	<TEXT>  I studied criminology and a massive amount was related to substance usage/trends/abuse. Its not so much that those statistics are WRONG but it is incredibly misleading and is directly contradictory to other evidence that I have seen.

The people who end up getting themselves in trouble are not representative of the general population. Drug use and alcohol use are heavily linked to crime. People who use drugs and alcohol are much more likely to commit crimes, probably because their judgement is impaired, and probably also because the people who abuse drugs and alcohol are more likely to have poor judgement/self control to begin with.

 I agree about 25-30% dont drink at all. But after that? Asking people 'how many drinks do you per day' doesnt mean shit. Most people dont drink everyday. That's an awful survey question most likely aimed at promoting an agenda.

The survey doesn't just ask how many drinks people have per day. It comes from [NESARC](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA70/AA70.htm) and NLAES data, which asks more than one question about this stuff. In fact, it is a study specifically designed for this purpose, not just some random crappy thing.

Moreover, you can actually look at industry data and try to figure out how much alcohol people drink, and then backcalculate how much adults must be drinking.

Pareto distributions and [log-normal distributions](http://stat.ethz.ch/~stahel/lognormal/bioscience2001.pdf) are pretty common in nature. And indeed, alcohol consumption curves in countries other than the US look very similar. [Here's an article from Slate discussing it.](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/10/how_much_alcohol_do_americans_drink_consumption_predicts_alcoholism_and.html)

Heavy drinking isn't normal. The national average is about 566 drinks per year. But this is not even remotely distributed evenly over the population. As with a lot of things, you've got a lot of people who do very little, and a few people who do a lot.

 From data I have seen, at the 25-40 age range approximately, it would be about 20% dont drink, 20% drink weekly, 40% go drinking maybe 2-3 times a month (this is the most common by far, those who go out with friends on the weekends etc), and the rest drink heavily, which ranges from 2-3 times a week to every day.

Where did you get this data from? Do you have a source? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's nothing "morally questionable" about it. If someone is in the country illegally, you should be reporting them to the proper authorities. If everyone did that, we wouldn't have problems with illegal immigration, as it would be impossible for them to get jobs here (which is the main reason why they're here in the first place).

Do you think immigration laws are not legitimate?

Immigration laws exist to help maintain standard of life.

The reason why Mexico is poor is because it is full of Mexicans. It is full of people who pay cops bribes, cops who take bribes, the cartels, and a lot of people without much in the way of education.

The reason why Syria is a warzone is because it is full of Syrians, who don't get along with each other and who think that their behavior is appropriate.

We selectively choose who comes to this country for a reason - it lets us bring in the best and exclude the worth, which makes America a better place by bringing in good people and excluding bad ones.

 So what does this division actually do? Report the person to ICE and then report the details to the federal government so Trump can tweet about it?

Uh, did you even [follow the link](https://www.ice.gov/voice)?

For reference:

https://www.ice.gov/voice

It *is* ICE. It is on the ICE website.

You can bitch at Trump about many things - you know, the treason, the rape, being a complete retard about everything, whatever.

But this is actually the appropriate agency to be reporting this stuff to.

ICE is interested in deporting immigrants who commit crimes. Note that it isn't just illegal ones - if you're here on a visa or whatever, that's generally conditional on good behavior. We kick out criminals. </TEXT>

It's actually worse than this though.

If you're actually interested, here's a long-ass thing I wrote a few days ago about inflation in cars:

-----

[The 2017 Nissan Versa has a MSRP of $11,990.](https://www.nissanusa.com/cars/versa-sedan/versions-specs/version.1-6-s.html)

This car gets 31 MPG city/39 MPG highway, it has a bluetooth hands free phone system, it has an AM/FM radio with 4 speakers and an auxillary audio input, it has AC standard, powered remote-control mirrors, and the standard safety features of modern vehicles (airbags, the LATCH system, stability control, anti-lock brakes, a tire-pressure monitoring system), a trip computer, power steering... this is all standard.

In a car that costs just under $12,000.

Note that the *average* car in 1990 cost [$16,950](http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/70yearsofpricechange.html). [And the average fuel economy was worse.](https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_04_23.html)

[If you look at subcompact cars, their fuel mileage was worse than the Versa.](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/Subcompact_Cars1990.shtml) Very few were comparable - the 1990 Chevrolet Turbo Sprint had similar MPG (31 city/38 highway), as did the 1990 Daihatsu Charade, the 1990 Ford Festiva, the 1990 Geo Metro LSI, the 1990 Pontiac Turbo Firefly, and the 1990 Suzuki Swift. A tiny handful of cars; the overwhelming majority got in the high teens or the 20s. Note also that a number of these were 2-door cars, not 4-door sedans like the Nissan Versa, and were significantly smaller and lighter vehicles  the 1990 Suzuki Swift, for instance, weighs more than 500 pounds less than the 2017 Nissan Versa!

This isnt surprising, given many of these vehicles were two-seaters and are smaller vehicles.

Most of these vehicles were lacking in features  one review of the 1990 geo metro notes Don't even bother with one of these cars if you care how you look in your car, need any kind of creature comforts, or have any need for a car that can perform in a straight line or through the canyons.

Sadly, it is hard to find MSRPs on a lot of old cars because fuck anyone who wants to actually do research, right? Sites like NewCarTestDrive only go back to 1994 or so, where you can find that things like the [Honda Accord had a MSRP of $20,187 in 1994](https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/1994-honda-accord/) for a car with AC, an AM/FM stereo, power windows and door locks, dual air bags, ect. It also got 25 mpg city/ 31 highway.

Doing this is a huge pain in the ass, is what I am saying.

But... we can at least find some stuff.

1991 Geo Metro LSI  [After a huge amount of pain in the ass searching, this site suggests that for the bare basics  air conditioning, a minimal sound system, and a brace of floor mats  it was $11,121. And you only get two seats.](https://www.cars.com/reviews/los-angeles-timess-view-1420689068837/) And from what I can find, it didnt have power steering.

1990 Chevrolet Turbo Sprint - According to the [Geo Metro Wikipedia article, this is actually just a Geo Metro under another brand name.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_Metro)

1990 Ford Festiva  2 doors, 2-seater - $6,319, $7,111, or $7,750 for the L, L Plus, and LX respectively. [Edmunds lists nothing in terms of comfort and convenience;]( https://www.edmunds.com/ford/festiva/1990/review/) the only feature it seems to have is *airbags*. The L Plus added an AM/FM radio and a rear defogger, while the LX added a tilt-adjustable steering wheel (! Yes, this wasnt standard back then apparently, a feature I didnt even think of listing for the Versa), exterior power mirrors, and a rear wiper. So no power steering, no ABS, no stabilizer, no well, look at the list of Versa things above.

1990 Pontiac Turbo Firefly  According to the [Geo Metro Wikipedia article, this is actually just a Geo Metro under another brand name.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_Metro)

1990 Suzuki Swift - According to the [Geo Metro Wikipedia article, this is actually just a Geo Metro under another brand name.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_Metro)

1990 Daihatsu Charade  I cant find shit about this vehicles MSRP and I spent two hours looking.

The Geo Metro is only marginally cheaper (despite coming out 26 years ago!), has fewer features than the Versa, and is a two-door, two-seater that is, according to reviews, slow and kind of a piece of shit. But hey! It uh, is a car. It also is lacking a lot of the features of the Versa.

The Festiva is quite a bit cheaper (the cheapest model $5k cheaper, in fact!) but it is, again, a two-seater, and it has no features at all beyond airbags. It doesnt even have a rear wiper! Even the $7,750 model doesnt include most of the features of the Versa.

And this is why it is hard to really measure inflation. Both of these vehicles are clearly inferior to the 2017 Nissan Versa. Both are lacking a lot of features (many of which we would consider to be standard today). Theyre both smaller vehicles, which only seat two.

The $7,750 vehicle (the Ford Festiva) *is* appreciably cheaper but it doesnt include power steering, anti-lock brakes, a trip computer, stabilizer, tire pressure monitoring, the LATCH system for child seats, air conditioning, a Bluetooth hands-free phone system, a CVTCS, 46 less horsepower (63 vs 109),  auxiliary 12-volt DC power outlets, a 4-way adjustable drivers seat, the ability to play CDs or MP3s, an auxillary audio jack, a radio data system, speed-sensitive volume control, illuminated steering-wheel mounted audio controls, roof-mounted airbags, an ELR seatbelt system, modern crumple zones and buckling mechanisms

And it has, as noted, two fewer seats and is smaller in general.

Is all of that worth $4k?

If so, then the value per dollar hasn't really changed at all - we simply sell higher quality goods, which are naturally more expensive. </TEXT>

CPI grossly overestimates inflation.

What was the price of a box of cereal in 1995? Do you even know?

It was about what it was then what it is today.

A lot of products haven't really changed at all in price in a long time. There's a lot of goods which cost the same today as they cost in the mid-1990s. Some things have gotten more expensive, like meat and gasoline. But many others have not, and many (like TVs) have actually gone down in price. And still others - things like cars - have gotten better. The cheapest new car available in 2017 gives as much or more value per dollar spent on it than new 1990 cars did.

People need to stop lying about this stuff. The poverty line doubled over that time but the poverty rate hasn't changed. How can people get poorer when the poverty line doubled but the poverty rate hasn't? In fact, after taking government assistance into account, the poverty rate has actually gone down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, you bought into some real pro-fat bullshit. Fatties like to say that being fat isn't unhealthy.

Too bad it totally is and yes, being fat does trigger the onset of diabetes.

Obesity causes diabetes directly. The idea that it has anything to do with sugar is bullshit.

The cause is not directly known, but it is believed to be a result of stress on cells, either due to being overweight itself (additional body weight putting additional stress on the ER of cells) or because additional body mass makes your cells work harder.

[There are many risk factors for type 2 diabetes such as age, race, pregnancy, stress, certain medications, genetics or family history, high cholesterol and obesity. However, the single best predictor of type 2 diabetes is overweight or obesity. Almost 90% of people living with type 2 diabetes are overweight or have obesity. People who are overweight or have obesity have added pressure on their body's ability to use insulin to properly control blood sugar levels, and are therefore more likely to develop diabetes. The number of diabetes cases among American adults increased by a third during the 1990s, and additional increases are expected. This rapid increase in the occurrence of diabetes is mostly attributed to the growing prevalence of obesity in the United States.](http://www.obesity.org/content/weight-diabetes)

	<TEXT>  If you cross the street without a crosswalk, you're not innocent. You're breaking the law.

Depends on the state/location. A lot of places it is perfectly legal to cross the street without a crosswalk. Generally speaking, if there aren't controlled intersections, it is legal to cross the street without a crosswalk; if there are, you're supposed to cross at the marked location.

In an ordinary residential neighborhood, it is perfectly legal to cross the street wherever in most (all?) states.

If you cross the Interstate on foot, you can actually go to jail.

If you're in the country illegally, you should keep your nose clean. As the old saying goes, don't commit two crimes at the same time. :V </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  By analogy: The problem isn't that people shouldn't be allowed to take out student loans to go to college, the problem is that people shouldn't have to take out student loans to go to college.

I took out a loan to go to college. I paid it back. It wasn't a big deal at all.

There's nothing wrong with people taking out loans to go to college. It is an entirely reasonable thing for people to take out a loan to do.

The median loan people who take out loans take out is $13k. That's not unreasonable. That's about what I had.

Most people (75% of borrowers) have less than $29k.

The average annual wage earnings among this population was $71,700. $29k debt with that kind of wage is not even remotely unreasonable.

And note that not everyone takes out a loan to go to college at all. Many people don't.

There's two groups of people who go into high levels of debt for college: irresponsible idiots and people who have the reasonable expectation of making a lot of money.

[The popular narrative around crushing student debt burdens is inconsistent with the reality for most borrowers.](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-typical-household-with-student-loan-debt/)

People need to stop spouting bullshit.

 Your argument seems to be built entirely on corner cases: one guy who's billions in debt, an underwater mortgage. Yes, you can construct individual anecdotes where negative wealth is a reasonable temporary outcome.

It isn't a corner case. All of the people with the lowest net worths are rich people.

It's universal.

You can't go millions of dollars in debt unless you're wealthy or you do something seriously wrong and face major legal penalties as a result. That's it.

No one else can go that far into debt.

People who spend money irresponsibly do go into debt. And that is the normal case for people who are in debt. That's how it goes. That's the *reality* of the situation.

I know it makes you uncomfortable, but that's the cold, hard truth. </TEXT>

Knowing how much someone has saved is more important than their net worth in terms of telling what happens when they lose their job - someone who lives paycheck to paycheck but who isn't in debt will quickly end up in trouble as they struggle to make their payments, while someone who has a $300,000 mortgage which is $100,000 more than their house but has $100,000 in the bank is not in dire straits if they lose their job.

	<TEXT>  That is just... so, so false.

Yeah, sorry, but you have bought into a pack of lies. The anti-sugar thing is just as much of a scam as the anti-fat thing.

But of course, like most people who are subject to cons, you are desperately trying to avoid admitting you've been conned.

 That's when you're thin but your organs look just like those of an obese person because the fat has developed between and over the organs, not layered so much as belly fat and in other areas.

*sigh*

Okay, so let's be clear here:

[Obesity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity) is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health.

While this is generally done using BMI, there are other measures, such as [percent body fat.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage)

There is no such thing as "skinny fat". This is one of those myths fatties use to make themselves feel better.

There are people who are of *normal* BMI who have high percent body fat because they are lacking in muscle mass, but if you're actually physically skinny, your percent body fat simply is not going to be very high.

That does not necessarily mean that skinny people are healthy. Exercise has been demonstrated to be important independent of BMI - people who exercise are better off than those who do not, generally speaking, though both contribute.

It should also be noted that more recent studies have shown that BMI is actually quite an important measure, and that overemphasis on percent body fat may be misplaced - heavier people seem to just be less healthy, probably due to additional stress on organs.

 Becoming fat is the end result because excess glucose is converted to fat for storage.

God damn you don't understand biology. Have you ever taken a biology class?

So here's the deal:

The body can convert all forms of caloric energy into glucose, because glucose is how your body transports energy via your blood. This is particularly important to your brain, because your brain cannot take in fatty acids from your blood.

Secondly, all carboyhydrates can be converted into glucose. 

 When you have an insulin disorder

Oh child. Type 2 diabetes is CAUSED by obesity. Type 2 diabetes - the most common form of diabetes - is mostly caused by obesity. Somewhere in the realm of 60-80% of diabetic white people and close to 100% of diabetic black people with type 2 diabetes develop it while obese. While there are other causes of type 2 diabetes (alcoholism, for instance, can also trigger it), it is primarily associated with obesity.

When people talk about sugar and diabetes, it is deliberate misdirection. Healthy people can consume sugar just fine. Diabetic people have to watch their diets - particularly for carbs. All carbs are digested into glucose, which leads to spikes in blood glucose because diabetic people aren't capable of properly regulating blood glucose levels.

However, eating a large meal in general while diabetic is a bad idea as your body is no longer capable of properly regulating blood-glucose levels.

 Insulin resistance is largely a result of ingesting too many carbohydrate. Insulin ONLY affects glucose. It doesn't care if you're ingesting more fat or protein (protein can be converted to glucose too but the effects are so slow and limited that it couldn't be considered an issue.). While fat can be processed into usable energy, it likely will not have as much of an effect on blood glucose levels as easily digestible carbohydrate. 

The problem with this idea is that it is wrong.

Glucose and fat can both be metabolized into glucose and frequently are. This is, again, something you learn in high school biology. Not only can they be turned into glucose, a considerable amount is turned into glucose. The more protein you eat, the more gets converted into glucose, because your body only needs so much protein.

In diabetic people, this process is broken, so their blood glucose levels tend to fluctuate a lot more, which is bad because getting your blood glucose too low or too high is bad.

 Obesity only leads to diabetes in the sense that it's a feedback loop... eat sugar, be unable to use it all, get fat, develop insulin resistance because glucose intake is too high for the pancreas to keep up, get fatter, worsened insulin resistance because pancreas can't produce enough, etc.

You get fat from eating excess calories *from any source*. Fat, unsurprisingly, just gets stored as fat. Excess protein (about 50% of our daily protein) gets converted into glucose, which then can be converted into fat or glycogen. </TEXT>

Diabetes is caused by obesity. The link between excess sugar consumption and diabetes is simply because people who eat excess sugar are more likely to be obese. The cause isn't the sugar, it is the obesity. Eat too many calories and you'll end up obese.

Eating excessive amounts of anything will make it more likely you'll develop diabetes, but that's because diabetes is primarily caused by obesity.

 hypertension can be caused by the consumption of too many Saturated/Trans fats

Again, only if it makes you obese. </TEXT>

Lead is not used because it is soft, but because it is cheap and *dense*. [The denser a bullet is, the better its penetration is.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_depth) Penetration is relative to the density of the penetrating object compared to the density of the object it is penetrating.

Denser bullets are also less prone to being affected by outside forces like wind.

This is why depleted uranium is even better - it is even denser (and also has other desirable properties, such as being pyrophoric. On the downside, it is radioactive). You can almost make bullets out of tungsten, which is also super-dense.

Obviously, lead works fine for shooting people, but if you are shooting at materiel, being able to penetrate, say, steel, is useful. </TEXT>

The thing is, while simply humping a tree and regenerating your health leads to odd gameplay at times, the whole "you need to get to cover or you will die" thing isn't actually a bad mechanic. It also depends on the nature of the game; it feels much more natural for shields to regenerate or for a nanosuit (Crysis) to regenerate than it does for a regular old soldier.

The problem that this design was trying to solve was a problem you see in a number of games - basically, if you have a finite amount of resources, the difficulty of any encounter is dependent on the previous ones.

Having a set amount of health that heals before every battle is a good thing because it allows you, as the designer, to know exactly how well off the player will be for every encounter - they can take X many hits. This actually allows you to design more difficult encounters, as the player doesn't get weaker and weaker the further into the mission they go, and allows for you to actually make things harder and harder without making the end of the mission feel ridiculous.

It also allows you to make every encounter a threat - you can die easily on any encounter, rather than having your health worn down and dying on the fifth one because you took too much damage on the first four encounters. Each encounter along the line has more potential for failure, but once they pass it, they're actually past it and they don't have to replay it again because they took one too many hit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really, what they *should* do is just to give you back full health at each checkpoint. Basically your health is a resource to make it through an encounter. This leads to each encounter (however long that might be - a single battle, a sequence, whatever) to have the same starting point, and it eliminates the need for health packs.

Plus, presumably, you have some space between encounters, so it feels less weird. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A story is improved by having a worthwhile theme.

There's nothing better about writing about a place than writing about a person, a group of people, or any other thing.

Writing about a place is different from writing about a person, which is in turn different from writing about a group of people.

If you look at, say, FF6 or Chrono Trigger, they aren't the story of an individual person, but a group of protagonists who work to change the world for the better. They're really well-known and well-received games... and yet, the formula there is seldom copied. Games mostly have a single protagonist, despite the fact that in a party-based game, there's no actual reason for this to be true.

The thing is, most games have crappy writing. Crappy writing is crappy writing - writing about a world instead of a person is actually harder, not easier, because writing something like [Lost Cities](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/102166/lost-cities) is tough - and really, a lot of the time, the story is told in part by implication.

I've seen people describe Bethesda games as being like amusement parks - there's a bunch of rides spread around, and they might be pretty good, but they're not really stuck together very well because the player can do them in any order and, well, Bethesda isn't necessarily the best at writing. Writing scenes is easier than writing stories, and writing an effective scene only requires a surface-level analysis of a character, while writing a story generally requires more depth out of your characters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This is a myth. The free territories were up against the soviet union, so their loss was not exactly suprising. According to Orwell, the spanish anarchists system of democratic millitary worked just fine, the problem was that it was basically just peasants with guns vs an actual millitary.

And why were they just peasants with guns instead of an actual military?

You're making excuses.

The reality is that without real organization you cannot do a lot of macro-level things that are necessary for a society to operate in the long term. Indeed, the rebels actually had some military hardware, but there were internal issues with its utilization and distribution because the various factions would keep their hardware for themselves instead of working out how to most efficiently distribute it for the war effort. In a centralized military, you have your people at the top who can dictate where various resources go, but in a decentralized anarchist state, the lack of ability to centrally organize your military cripples your coordination. Coordination is a huge factor in military success. [Defeat in detail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail) is a real military tactic.

Real life is this kind of huge problem for all of these people. Because, you see, their failures were due to their systems being completely unworkable.

As it turns out, such top-level hierarchical organization is really important to macro-level success.

 The people don't hold any actual power though.

The people voted for representatives. That's how representative democracy works.

 So egoist anarchism, which is generally common among anarchists, that literally think the ego is always the highest authority and submitting to somebody elses rules without earning from it is bad, is totallitarian?

Yup! Did you even bother reading my post? I explained why.

 Totalitarianism is about dictating how people are allowed to live their lives. Anarchism and socialism are totalitarian philosophies because they regulate how people are allowed to interact with each other on a very basic level, as well as because they seize property and often kill people who don't like the system. They have little regard for the rights of others.

Maybe you should have actually read my post, instead of desperately grasping for more excuses.

But then, I guess that would have bruised your ego~

 The similarities between socialism and fascism is basically just authoritarianism.

Actually, there's a lot more than that. There's a reason for the political horseshoe theory.

 Their form of capitalism was in all ways closer to US capitalism or scandinavian social democracies than it was to socialism.

It was a lot more statist than those countries are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it is. Sorry to burst your bubble, but it is diagnosed and treated as a mental illness. Gender dysphoria - the mental illness - is *not* their gender identity. It is the distress *caused* by their gender identity. Which, you know, I specifically noted in my post above:

 Gender dysphoria is a mental illness which arises when someone's gender identity (i.e. what they mentally perceive their gender as) doesn't fit their physical gender **and causes them distress.**

As noted by the APA itself:

 "The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition."

If there's nothing wrong with them - if it isn't causing them distress - then they don't need treatment and they don't have gender dysphoria.

It is possible to have a different gender identity that doesn't cause you psychiatric distress, according to the DSM. Such persons would not be identified as having gender dysphoria, because it isn't bothering them.

This is true of mental illnesses in general -  if it isn't causing you problems, then it isn't a mental illness. This is why homosexuality got delisted as a mental illness - it was determined that homosexuality didn't cause people any sort of problems in and of itself.

If you need treatment, though... well, yeah, you've got a mental illness, seeing as it is a psychological ailment which is causing distress (there isn't anything *physically* wrong with such folks).

If you don't think that gender dysphoria is a mental illness, then what do you think it *is*? Why do you think people receive psychiatric care for the condition?

They changed its name from Gender Identity Disorder to Gender Dysphoria due to lobbying from trans advocates, and they changed a few thing about its diagnostic criteria to clarify what it was, but it is still a mental illness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Here's some historical TV prices.](http://www.tvhistory.tv/tv-prices.htm)

[The 2017 Nissan Versa has a MSRP of $11,990.](https://www.nissanusa.com/cars/versa-sedan/versions-specs/version.1-6-s.html)

This car gets 31 MPG city/39 MPG highway, it has a bluetooth hands free phone system, it has an AM/FM radio with 4 speakers and an auxillary audio input, it has AC standard, powered remote-control mirrors, and the standard safety features of modern vehicles (airbags, the LATCH system, stability control, anti-lock brakes, a tire-pressure monitoring system), a trip computer, power steering... this is all standard.

In a car that costs just under $12,000.

Note that the *average* car in 1990 cost [$16,950](http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/70yearsofpricechange.html). [And the average fuel economy was worse.](https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_04_23.html)

[If you look at subcompact cars, their fuel mileage was worse than the Versa.](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/Subcompact_Cars1990.shtml) Very few were comparable - the 1990 Chevrolet Turbo Sprint had similar MPG (31 city/38 highway), as did the 1990 Daihatsu Charade, the 1990 Ford Festiva, the 1990 Geo Metro LSI, the 1990 Pontiac Turbo Firefly, and the 1990 Suzuki Swift. A tiny handful of cars; the overwhelming majority got in the high teens or the 20s. Note also that a number of these were 2-door cars, not 4-door sedans like the Nissan Versa, and were significantly smaller and lighter vehicles  the 1990 Suzuki Swift, for instance, weighs more than 500 pounds less than the 2017 Nissan Versa!

This isnt surprising, given these were small two-seater vehicles.

Most of these vehicles were lacking in features  one review of the 1990 geo metro notes Don't even bother with one of these cars if you care how you look in your car, need any kind of creature comforts, or have any need for a car that can perform in a straight line or through the canyons.

Sadly, it is hard to find MSRPs on a lot of old cars because fuck anyone who wants to actually do research, right? Sites like NewCarTestDrive only go back to 1994 or so, where you can find that things like the [Honda Accord had a MSRP of $20,187 in 1994](https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/1994-honda-accord/) for a car with AC, an AM/FM stereo, power windows and door locks, dual air bags, ect. It also got 25 mpg city/ 31 highway.

Doing this is a huge pain in the ass, is what I am saying.

But... we can at least find some stuff.

1991 Geo Metro LSI  [After a huge amount of pain in the ass searching, this site suggests that for the bare basics  air conditioning, a minimal sound system, and a brace of floor mats  it was $11,121. And you only get two seats.](https://www.cars.com/reviews/los-angeles-timess-view-1420689068837/) And from what I can find, it didnt have power steering.

1990 Chevrolet Turbo Sprint - According to the [Geo Metro Wikipedia article, this is actually just a Geo Metro under another brand name.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_Metro)

1990 Ford Festiva  2 doors, 2-seater - $6,319, $7,111, or $7,750 for the L, L Plus, and LX respectively. [Edmunds lists nothing in terms of comfort and convenience;]( https://www.edmunds.com/ford/festiva/1990/review/) the only feature it seems to have is *airbags*. The L Plus added an AM/FM radio and a rear defogger, while the LX added a tilt-adjustable steering wheel (! Yes, this wasnt standard back then apparently, a feature I didnt even think of listing for the Versa), exterior power mirrors, and a rear wiper. So no power steering, no ABS, no stabilizer, no well, look at the list of Versa things above.

1990 Pontiac Turbo Firefly  According to the [Geo Metro Wikipedia article, this is actually just a Geo Metro under another brand name.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_Metro)

1990 Suzuki Swift - According to the [Geo Metro Wikipedia article, this is actually just a Geo Metro under another brand name.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_Metro)

1990 Daihatsu Charade  I cant find shit about this vehicles MSRP and I spent ages looking. If you can find it, more power to you.

The Geo Metro is only marginally cheaper (despite coming out 26 years ago!), has fewer features than the Versa, and is a two-door, two-seater that is, according to reviews, slow and kind of a piece of shit. But hey! It uh, is a car. It also is lacking a lot of the features of the Versa.

The Festiva is quite a bit cheaper (the cheapest model $5k cheaper, in fact!) but it is, again, a two-seater, and it has no features at all beyond airbags. It doesnt even have a rear wiper! Even the $7,750 model doesnt include most of the features of the Versa.

And this is why it is hard to really measure inflation. Both of these vehicles are clearly inferior to the 2017 Nissan Versa. Both are lacking a lot of features (many of which we would consider to be standard today). Theyre both smaller vehicles, which only seat two.

The $7,750 vehicle (the Ford Festiva) *is* appreciably cheaper but it doesnt include power steering, anti-lock brakes, a trip computer, stabilizer, tire pressure monitoring, the LATCH system for child seats, air conditioning, a Bluetooth hands-free phone system, a CVTCS, 46 less horsepower (63 vs 109),  auxiliary 12-volt DC power outlets, a 4-way adjustable drivers seat, the ability to play CDs or MP3s, an auxillary audio jack, a radio data system, speed-sensitive volume control, illuminated steering-wheel mounted audio controls, roof-mounted airbags, an ELR seatbelt system, modern crumple zones and buckling mechanisms

And it has, as noted, two fewer seats and is smaller in general.

Is all of that worth $4k?

If so, then that 2017 vehicle is giving as much or more value as the 1990 ones were per dollar.

----

The Big Lie is that people haven't gotten richer.

The reality is that we have gotten richer. A *lot* richer. Having more and better stuff is exactly what you expect when someone gets richer.

What do you think being richer actually means?

I suspect this is your major malfunction. You think that being richer means you're a rich guy with no day job.

That isn't what being richer means.

Having new creature comforts as standard is exactly what you expect when a society gets richer! Running water is not a luxury, it is normal now - but people with running water are better off than those without it.

We are rich relative to people in the past. Given that's the *entire point of comparison* - are we richer today than we were in the past? - we cannot pretend like it isn't relevant. The Fox News segment isn't wrong that we are rich compared to how people were in the past, because we *are*.

Having a microwave improves quality of life. It didn't used to be normal to have one, and they were an expensive luxury item. Today, they're everywhere.

Cost of living has gone up because the *standard* of living has gone up. It is much cheaper to be a squatter in a cave than it is to live in a nice modern house. But an increase in standard of living is NOT inflation. Inflation is when the *same thing* gets more expensive.

When people make more money, they spend more money, because they have more money to spend on things which will make their lives better.

But this doesn't mean that those people aren't any better off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> CPI is the highest inflationary index; IPD is lower. None of the inflationary indexes are designed with measuring multi-decade inflation because they simply can't, though. If you look, the CPI is calculated monthly, and they use the CPI across multiple years to calculate inflation.

The way you calculate inflation is by taking bundles of goods and you look at how much that bundle costs at various points in time. The issue is that this doesn't work across large periods of time because the bundles are no longer equivalent.

A bag of rice is a bag of rice, but a 1959 24" black and white TV is not a 2017 24" 1080p flatscreen LCD TV. These sorts of quality improvements make it very hard to do any sort of accurate calculation.

For instance, if you compare the cheapest 2016 automobile to 1990 vehicles with similar features, you quickly find some features simply weren't available in 1990. But if you ignore those features, you see an inflation rate of about 25%. But the CPI puts it much higher than that for cars, as the average price of a new car has almost doubled in that time period.

But the problem is that the price of cars hasn't really doubled, it is that people buy nicer cars. Obviously a nicer car is going to be more expensive, so some of that isn't inflation, it is buying higher quality goods (which isn't inflation).

The CPI's monthly calculations thus are reasonable for trying to look at short-term inflation, but looking at multi-decade inflation, it gets weird and isn't really representative. CPI claims that median income has hardly changed since the mid 1970s, despite the fact that cars have gotten vastly better, appliances have gotten vastly better, AC has become ubiquitous, the Internet is a thing now, cell phones and smart phones are a thing now, houses got 1000+ square feet bigger, and many goods (computers, TVs, microwaves) have stayed constant or gone down in nominal price.

This really just shows that CPI overestimates inflation. Inflation is a real thing, but CPI doesn't appear to be a very good long-term measurement of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the real problem, in the end - it is a shitty PvP experience, at least when you're directly attacking each other.

The only real way to do PvP would be for it to be additive rather than subtractive - i.e. the PvP aspect is competing for resources or trying to build a better thing or accomplish some goal, rather than being about destroying other people's stuff or taking their resources directly from their place.

The problem is that the real attraction of a crafting experience is building up your stuff from scratch to amazing, and of building your own stuff. Tearing down people's stuff directly conflicts with this attraction.

Thus, this sort of PvP simply shouldn't exist in such games because it takes away the main attraction of crafting games. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bastion's turret mode needs to be reworked </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-02 08:06:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Turret mode Bastion is a brick wall.

What is a brick wall, you might ask?

A brick wall is a way of fighting which is very easy to execute, will allow you to win easily if not countered, and is harder to beat than it is to do.

A lot of people know from the good old days that Bastion is seen as very powerful by new players, but players quickly realize how to beat Bastion sitting around in turret mode in the same spot all the time.

This led people to dismiss Bastion as terrible.

The thing is, most players never learned how to play Bastion "for realsies" - they leaned entirely on his turret mode, and failed to actually use his full kit. And why would they? His turret mode seemed so powerful, it is mystifying to players that playing in some way which makes less use of it would make a character stronger. But it does, because learning how to mix things up with Bastion makes him a lot less predictable.

Buffing his turret mode (as Ironclad did) is 100% a mistake. The reason is that it encourages his brick wall strategy. It is a means of making his brick wall strategy harder to bypass - but it doesn't make him fun or interesting to play against.

Brick wall strategies are bad design because they lead to very boring games. Either you can beat the brick wall, and the player using said strategy loses, or you can't beat the brick wall, and the player using said strategy wins. The game entirely hinges on the brick wall, but the gameplay is never really fun - brick walls are repetitive and if the brick wall is bypassed, the player playing the brick wall character doesn't know how to do much else because they're encouraged to play them as a brick wall and don't really learn the rest of the character.

The thing is, most players play Bastion in turret mode all the time because the game seems to be encouraging them to do so, and most players will simply discard him once it becomes clear that this strategy is easily countered. And this makes it hard to [i]fix[/i] Bastion for most of the player base, because most of them will *only* employ his seemingly powerful turret mode, and think any vulnerabilities in it make it "bad", when in fact it is a powerful but situational tool.

There's only one realistic solution: force people to not use turret mode all the time.

Ironclad needs to be nuked. But the turret ability in general needs to be changed - Bastion's turret mode needs to be shifted over to some sort of cooldown ability. Maybe it should just be he goes into that mode and starts spraying bullets, and then leave the mode after his clip is expended automatically. Maybe the mode is time-limited, and then put on cooldown after he exits the mode. Maybe the mode has a limited number of bullets and can't reload, so when you run out, you have to leave the mode.

It doesn't really matter. The point is, the way Bastion was even pre-patch encouraged players to spend all their time in turret mode, sitting around camping in the same spot, and most players will simply not look beyond that unless the game itself forces them to do otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why Ironclad is Broken </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-01 15:07:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I've been seeing some discussion about Bastion, but I'd like to explain why Ironclad (and indeed, damage reduction in general) is broken in Overwatch.

In Overwatch, there's fairly powerful healing abilities. However, healers do not heal faster than damage dealers deal damage. This is very obvious if you look at Ana/Mercy - Mercy heals 60 damage per second, and Ana 80 per shot. Meanwhile, most of the cast deals much higher damage than that - even Mercy, who is infamously bad offensively, does 100 DPS.

With Ironclad, you take 65% of the damage you would ordinarily take. You might think that 35% damage reduction increases your hit points by 35%, but this is actually wrong - 35% damage reduction increases your hit points by effectively 53%.

The reason why is that instead of taking 100% damage, you're taking 65% damage. 100/65 = 1.53.

A simple example: say there was something that previously killed you in three shots - say, 100 damage per shot. Now you're taking 65 damage per shot.

65 + 65 + 65 = 195 damage. You actually have to take five shots (325 damage) to die now, and you will only just barely die.

Merely increasing someone's hit point total, however, is not enough to be broken. What really makes this broken is the fact that it effectively increases healing by 53% as well.

As a result, mercy is effectively healing you for over 90 damage per second, while Ana is healing you for over 120 damage per shot. And your own self-heal ability, at 75 hp/second, is above what Mercy is doing - and at any time, you can switch over to self-healing.

It is also worth noting that, in Overwatch, damage equals ultimate charge. Someone with effectively 450 hit points, but who only takes 300 damage, is effectively robbing the enemy team of a third of their ult charge relative to their damage.

This is why Ironclad - and indeed, all damage reduction abilities - are so powerful in Overwatch. Nanoboost is so potent in part because, when being pocket healed by an Ana, it is very hard to kill a nanoboosted target at all.

Ironclad, being something which can be turned on at will, is extremely powerful, and it ends up breaking the game in some bad ways.

There's another problem as well - in turret mode, Bastion can only be headshotted from behind - i.e. the non-dangerous side. This is in contrast to every other character in the game, who can be headshotted from every direction. While this in theory makes him weak to being flanked, in practice he can turn around very quickly, and can also simply put himself in a corner or near a wall, where it is very hard to hit him from behind and get the headshot. This further increases the potency of Ironclad, as not only is he massively tougher and massively better healed, but the enemy side loses their primary way of boosting damage against him - scoring headshots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Just had a 22:38 minute match on Lijang Tower.](http://i.imgur.com/B429zSm.jpg)

It wasn't too bad at first. Sure, the first round went to 99% on both sides... we won the second round... lost the third round marginally...

Then the fourth round was this insanely terrible overtime where we got to 99%, then the other team capped the point in OT and got to 99%, and then we just kept on zerging the point from our spawn over and over and over again. Managed to do so for long enough for the overtime bar to almost instantly go to zero if we left the point... but we managed to finally win it back!

At which point the *other* team started jumping on the point, stalling as long as possible, and I'm just laughing to myself about how they were worried about this happening on every other map type...

I think the D. Vas on each team got their ult up three times apiece during overtime.

Then the fifth round also had some overtime, though it was a lot more one-sided and they didn't keep the point for that long.

What's your "Athena, how did that round last that long?" story? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Damage is not defined by role in Overwatch </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-27 17:39:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I see this mistake from time to time amongst people who don't really understand Overwatch, and I think it is vitally important to understand:

*All* heroes in Overwatch deal damage.

A lot of people have simplified "Offense and defense" into DPS. I understand that a lot of people come from MMO backgrounds, as well as from MOBAs, but the reality is that the idea of "DPS" is deeply flawed.

In Overwatch, *everyone* deals damage, because the point of the game is to kill the enemy team and take the objectives, and almost all of the characters are designed to be able to proactively do so.

Seven characters can deal over 200 damage with either their basic attack or a basic ability. Three of them (Torbjorn, Widowmaker, and Hanzo) are Defense. One of them (Reaper) is offense. Two of them (Reinhardt and Roadhog) are tanks. One of them (Zenyatta) is support.

And yet, I see people acting like it is somehow surprising that tanks and supports deal lots of damage.

Indeed, if you look at the characters who deal the highest "damage per second" in the game in their effective ranges, they're not at all confined to a single role. Indeed, members of all four roles have high and low "damage per second".

The roles are not, in fact, about damage. They're about your function on the team.

Offense heroes are mostly defined by their mobility and consequently apply pressure to a selected point; indeed, the only offense hero whose mobility isn't all that great is McCree, making him something of an outlier, though his range and high accuracy does help him apply pressure, and his stun can help break up a block of enemies. No one doubts Genji's place amongst these heroes, even though his "damage per second" is rather lackluster.

The defense characters are mostly defined by what Blizzard felt was their ability to hold position and make it dangerous to enter an area; all of them but Mei are highly effective at laying down damage from long range, with Mei instead being more of a controller type character, a character who applies debuffs and modifies the battlefield - this is closest to a defensive ability, so she got thrown in with the defense characters, even though she plays very differently from them. Many of these characters boast very high damage, including Bastion, who has the highest damage of any character in the game - but Mei has quite poor damage, and is one of the few characters who cannot kill you within a single second even with headshots.

Tanks are defined by their ability to lead a team into battle, hold points, toughness, and area denial - they are dangerous to stand close to, and protect their allies from harm both directly (with barriers and bubbles and similar things) and indirectly, by making it dangerous to stand close to them and therefore, defending their more frail allies by their mere presence by deterring foes from hanging around them.

Support characters are mostly defined by having healing abilities and buffing their team, as well as debuffing their enemies. Symmetra is the real outlier there - she is more of a defense character, like Torbjorn - but is in there because of her ability to generate shields and because her teleporter has the effect of reducing a team's down time (in a sort of weird pseudo-rezzing way). While some of these characters have poor damage output, Zenyatta has very high damage output, and his discord orbs raise not only his own damage output, but that of his entire team. But no one would doubt that he is a healer.

Dealing damage is part of a character's kit, but it is not confined to any particular role, nor does it define it. What really defines a character's role on a team is not their damage output, but what they contribute to a team. And all characters deal damage - indeed, they must, so that they can contribute to a team and help them win.

The idea that one particular role or another has a monopoly on damage is false. They don't. That isn't how the game is designed. Damage is an important part of every character's kit, but it doesn't define role - role is defined by how the character contributes to their team. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> DPS is misleading - damage lands faster than it appears </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-25 02:37:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Who kills you faster with their primary weapon: McCree or Soldier 76?

The most obvious answer is to look at DPS. McCree does 70 damage per shot with a body shot, and shoots twice per second, for 140 DPS. Soldier 76 does 20 damage per shot, and fires 8.8 shots per second, for 176 DPS.

Who kills you first with nothing but body shots?

Hint: it isn't Soldier 76.

The reason why is fairly simple if you think about how much damage has been done over time. McCree does 70 damage at time = 0. Soldier 76 does 20. At half a second, McCree has done 140 damage. And at 1 second, McCree has done 210 damage.

Soldier 76, meanwhile, will have only done 180 damage by that point, having fired off 9 shots.

This is even more obvious if you compare them when they land headshots half the time. McCree does 140 damage with a headshot, Soldier 76 does 40. McCree will kill you after just two shots - which he can get off in half a second. Soldier 76, even if he lands half of his shots as headshots, will take seven shots to kill you.

Characters who fire a small number of high damage shots per second deal damage much sooner than characters who fire a large number of low damage shots per second, even if the low-damage character has the same DPS.

Junkrat fires 1.66 shots per second, or a shot per 40 frames at 60 FPS. His shots do 120 damage on a direct hit, meaning that if Junkrat hits you with two direct shots, you're going to die on frame 40 + travel time for his projectile - or in a bit more than 2/3rds of a second.

Reinhardt does 75 damage per swing. His first swing comes out at 0 seconds, his second swing at 1 second, and his third swing at 2 seconds - meaning that if you are in close quarters with Rein, he isn't killing you in three seconds (as you might suspect from his 75 DPS), he's actually killing you in two seconds.

While DPS can be an important number to know, remember that it can be very misleading - *when* over the course of that second damage is done is very important to know. </TEXT>
