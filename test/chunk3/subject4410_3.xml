	<TEXT> Sorry for the trash title, but something needed to be said. After the unfortunate suicide of Commissioner of the BBGMSL (chill he jut deleted his account), that league has gone into absolute anarchy and chaos. At first I tried to revive the league, but now it is best that we let it die. R.I.P. /r/BBGMSL. However, I decided to something about it. I am making another of these leagues, the NGBML, but I don't want it to be a remake, I want it to be different, but like an exciting different. Know what I mean? Like, I want crazy ideas about what I should do, but there is some basis to this: 1985 roster, but the draft classes after 1987 are all backwards, so maybe we will see curry play in the 90s after all, huh? I think that this will be a vengeance league (sort of) and it will revive the fun in playing multiplayer Basketball GM that our wonderful Lord 
/u/dumbmatter (all hail lord dumbmatter) has created. The possibilities for my game are almost endless. Please comment suggestions, and also comment whether or not you would like to join, first come first serve on mods, for anyone who would like to mod, please PM your application, and provide your history and background in this game. Hope you enjoyed reading this (somewhat) and you think mostly highly of my idea. I understand this is untraditional, but /r/BGMLL and /r/AmericanBasketballFed are going to fill up within a minute, so this allows for flexibility for some people who want to be head GMs instead of assistant GMs. Please consider my idea and I hope you all didn't waste five minutes of your life!

Good Yard,

/u/subject4410 has recently assumed the position of General Manager of the Cleveland Cavaliers  in place of a man who is now dead with no family, and we are unable to identify him. We got a statement from him a couple of hours ago in which he stated, "I am very excited to join this team [Cleveland Cavaliers] and I am really hoping we can keep things strong here." That's the most recent news we have folks, hope we can keep this story updated.

	<DATE> 2017-03-07 04:53:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You guys'll never believe this happened because I didn't take any photos, so I will document this in text. In trying to beat Dynasty 3, I built perhaps the best Dynasty ever. Traded for the Nets '17 1st round pick, and reacquired our pick, so that we had 4 1st round picks. We drafted:

lol jk I forgot who we drafted, but we drafted 4 studs, who then went on to help out Ben Simmons in our overtake of the league. After tanking the first season and going **0-82** we picked up our slack and we didn't have another losing season again. After 10 consecutive chips, I thought getting this 11th would be a walk in the park. We were just too old, as we missed the next three consecutive years and struck out on the dynasty. Oh I remember, Lonzo Ball was a stud with Josh Jackson, and I think we also got Frank Ntilinka or whatever his name is. So as the sad story ends, I deleted the league w/o thinking I should post about this, and now here I am, complaining that players decline too early in their careers.
