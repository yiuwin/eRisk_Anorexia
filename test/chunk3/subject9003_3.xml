	<TEXT> Depends on one's tolerance and the quality of bud. Being a mmj patient that smokes bowls of hash before bed, that might bring me to a 6 if the bud is good

This whole highness scale is kinda annoying. I think that it's too relative and too arbitrary. Going by those scales, the only way to reach a 10 is to eat a bunch of edibles or take an entheogen. Even a 7 (the most common claim on this subreddit) is hard to reach with smoking. I fall asleep right around that point. Why can't we just say "I am gonna have a nice night" or "We were pretty high". Sorry for the rant but, this scale lacks reason and maturity.  </TEXT>

Edit: wow, thanks for all the downvotes. I'm honored. To clarify, I was just making a corollary on the inductive fallacy. I don't think *prove* is shorthand because people generally think that science can provide answers. Science is great at making us confident in certain things like gravity or motion, but we do not and will never understand what motion is and if it exists.  </TEXT>

You pull with your back to offset the 140lb girl in your arms. Try doing front squats for endurance (20 rep sets) and do lots of rows. Make sure your inner abdominals are strong and go from there. Maybe practice the actual bridal carrying once or twice a day. Make a routine out of it  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is similar to my experience with puke and bodybuilding workouts. Honestly, it's hard to puke from a BB workout. I was a mid and long distant track runner back in HS. Our conditioning workouts are to this date the most painful and difficult workouts I have ever endured. Our coach wasn't a marine or an Olympic athlete, but he made us run like hell. 

2-3 hours of lactic acid resistance training a day in the hot NY afternoon sun pushed about half the team to quit and puke. Mostly puking, because you can only quit once :)

I was always in great shape, but that first week hurts no matter how much you train before hand </TEXT>

All I know is that I want to make the best consequentialist choice regarding children.  It sounds like it is too complicated for us to understand and that may be an issue with consequentialism.

	<TEXT> Get your own chickens if you can. It's so easy to keep chickens and the eggs are better for you and your taste buds. 

I live in the U.S. and never refrigerate my eggs. Once they get put into the fridge, the egg is dead to me. Eggs that are never refrigerated taste much much better. Room temperature eggs are also much easier to cook because they are being cooked at a higher starting temperature (70f as opposed to 35f). 

Fresh eggs (day or two old) are great for a hard scramble, sunny side up or down, and especially good when poached! Older eggs (5+ days) are good for baking, soft scrambling, and boiling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a bit of a Concerta habit back in school. Here is how you can get more out of Concerta:
 
Concerta has a few parts (==+)

a. There is a shell. The shell has some methylphenidate in it. (~20%  of the pills total contents)

b. The parenthesis, "(  )", represent the ends of the ends of the pill's shell you cut around. It is white. The key is to put enough pressure on the shell that you hear a click, but not so hard that you cut into the inner parts of the pill.

c. The equal sign, "=", represent the inner methylphenidate portion of the pill. It is white and yellow in the 36mg pill.

d. The plus sign, "+", represent the time release. It is brown.

1. Use a sharp knife to run around the Concerta near the ends of the pill so the semi flat ends can pop off the pill with a knife. Save this.

2. Cut the pill length wise twice. The first cut is where ever, the second cut is on the opposite side of the pill.

3. Pop off the rest of the shell. Save it

4. Cut off the brown time release.

Some people will say that you can snort the insides, but I wouldn't  bother.

5. Put the shell and insides under your tongue.

6. When the shell disolves, swallow the pill.

7. Go crazy (but not too crazy)! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe I'm a little dull and misunderstand what you are saying but, the definition of logic is objective. This use of the word *logic* is not defined in the objective use of logic. You can use logic rhetorically to bolster your statements ethos. People do not realize or care that we are misusing the word logic. 

I think it is improper to misuse the word logic because it is misleads those who do not know any better. It is ironic that logic, a very rigorous analytical study, is being used for rhetoric. You won't see any rhetoric in the work of logicians like Wittgenstein or Spinoza.  </TEXT>

all the trails are sections of 2,000 mile trail, nature walks, river walks, and the occasional good trail. I think the best method for finding hiking trails in a new area is to ask a local who looks like they hike. As for finding new trails in your own area, I prefer to explore. For me hiking is not about objectives (find a trail, get to the trail head, enjoy the vantage points, finish the trail, etc.), its about exploration and the freedom associated with exploration. I usually pick an area and explore it instead of following a trail to a destination or whatever </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then start with some Plato as an introduction if you think German Philosophy is bad. Plato is another great option to introduce analytical thinking. Analytical philosophy is very dry and difficult, but for some people that makes it accessible. For someone who likes mathematics over literature, this makes reading a lot more fun. I read Wittgenstein as if it were a puzzle I need to piece together. When you finally get to the end of a book I get the same satisfying feeling that I experience when I finish a math problem or solve an actual puzzle.

Analytical Philosophy requires a different attitude. The words don't just brush over you and tell you whats up, you gotta figure out whats up.


At least, that's how I think about it. If you are saying that German Philosophy is bad, meaning it is mostly wrong, then we should investigate that claim. German Philosophy may appear to be mostly wrong right now, but that will most definitely change in the future. Meta-ethicists may now criticize Deontological, or Kantian, ethics. This may be true now, but we know this will not be true forever. Because of this we should not select who we read based on the current standings of a theory, i.e. german theories. Especially when reading through Philosophy historically. We should read who is being objected to before we read the objection. A thorough understanding of something is the only way to accept an objection of that thing. If you want to read Berkly, you may want to read Locke first to better understand Berkley. 
You get what I'm saying? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably not. Most schools try and make Philosophy classes open so students can take them as electives. Logic is a great class that will help you for the rest of your academic career. Ethics is good for you as an individual. It has you question what you believe in.

An intro class is usually just a sampler platter for all the fields in Philosophy. An intro class is not necessary, intellectually, to take other Philosophy courses. If you study ethics in an intro class, you will relearn that in an ethics class. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like this little thought experiment, or whatever you would call it. It leads you to ask questions that you may encounter in phenomenology:

  Wittgenstein is talking too a student on the grass at cambridge.
He asks the student, "In the time of the ancient romans, they thought  the sun revolved around the earth. Why did they think this?"
The student replies, "Because it looked as if the sun orbited the earth."
Wittgenstein asks, "What would it look like if the earth orbited the sun?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Colorado, spring starts at the end of march and comes to a close sometime in June when the thunderstorms show up. During this period the word Spring and Winter can be used to describe a location in the state. Seasons are not actually periods in annual weather cycle, but locations that are more probable during certain time periods. For example, this picture was taken in a time where spring is probable. On the left third of the picture, the location is spring. On the right two thirds of the picture, the location is winter.

	<TEXT> *I'll copy-paste the story from another forum. Just be mindful of the tone. It is supposed to sound ridiculous or pretentious. I hope that shines through and you can get a laugh out of it.* Here it is:





It's Saturday in a small mountain town and I was invited to camp with two lovely ladies at 420 fest. We leave Durango for the festival around noon and detour to the dispensary and gas station. We arrive around 3:30, see a friend (we'll call her Sarah), she lights a joint for us, and the four of us set up our makeshift camp. The  It turns out that its only a tent for two people and they planned this. All three of us were to share the tent. Sarah is contemplating camping because she needs to work on a final.

After setting up camp we go to the concert area. We made it there just before 4:20 and we smoke, of course. I saw my RA there, she's cool. After 4:20 everything gets blurry, but I'll do my best to remember.

We wandered around the camp sites without Sarah. Don't know where she went, but I don't mind. She is one of those girls I have to put in the friend zone because they can cause a lot of drama if they weren't. She kind of gets that, but she still persists. 

There were a lot of familiar faces around the camp sits, but nothing particularly interesting was going on yet. Naturally we went to take some shots of everclear when Sarah shows up. She had decided that she was going back to study and abstains from drinking.

After we took shots things get really blurry. I know what happened, but I can hardly tell the order of things. Here is just a list of things worth mentioning.


-We spent some time at our camp. We drink some more everclear and smoke some hash. Sarah heads out and the other two girls proceed to tell me they are bi. Yeah, just in case you couldn't tell, a threesome was in the works.


-We mixed the rest of the everclear with some sort of sobe drink. It turned out to be a really good combo. Then, we head over to the concert area and socialize some more and started dancing. 


-I really can't piece together what I did for the next four hours, but I was doing any of the following

	a) Hanging out at camp fires

	b) Dancing like crazy. A few of my friends were playing that night.

	c) Smoking some pot, but we really didn't smoke much later

	d) Starting a small fire of our own.

	e) Hanging out in a shelter right by the concert venue and messed around 	with the girls

	f) Going back to the camp sites and probably the car.


We begin to sober up and decide to go back to the camp site. I walked one of them in my arms and the other with her arms wrapped around me. All of were happy as could be, excited for the events to follow. 

We make it to the camp site after wandering through other camp sites and notice our neighbors were having a fire. We agreed to check out the fire and let things escalate there.

It turns the kids at the camp fire go to the same school as us. They had a wine bag and let us slap it a bunch of times. I was excited to get a little drunk but, at this point, I hadn't eaten anything for close to six hours. That wine bag snuck up on me like a mother fucker. I blacked out and woke up to a bunch of strangers moving me around and bandaging me up.

I woke up with a 2% full thickness burn (third degree burn on 2% of my body), burnt hair, partial thickness burns (second degree) all over my upper back, and my clothing was had caught on fire. No one knew what happened. The girls don't know. I don't even know the people who bandaged me (but I am absolutely grateful they were there to help me out). We went to the ER and realized that I had lost my wallet with my insurance card, debit card, MMJ card, drivers license, and my school ID. The rebandaged me, gave me pain and anti-nausea meds, and told me to see a plastic surgeon the next morning. 

I went back to the dorms where I proceeded to puke from the pain of second degree burns. Everytime I tried to move the pain made me dispel what water I had just drunk. When I ran out of water I laid I just laid in my bed. I tried to walk across the hall to the water fountain a few times, but whenever I sat up I would dry heave. The girls came to visit me a few times, but I politely told them to leave. I'm sure they didn't want to see me all pale and in pain, but they probably felt really bad. They did leave me by the fire, but they blacked out like I did. 

Eventually the pain subsided and I was able to call my parents and postpone a final. I tried to get some sleep, but it was pretty hard. I didn't take the pain meeds I was given, but the anti-nausea meds were effective. The only trick with the anti-nausea meds is, I need to stop throwing up. I smoked some hash oil and that helped a lot.

I'm getting skin grafted from my leg on thursday after my finals. I won't be able to do anything for a week. Keep me entertained NS, I will be pretty bored.

tl;dr Could have had a threesome, but drunk me decided to sleep in a fire. Don't drink on an empty stomach and pace yourself.

On the bright side, I got a cool tattoo and a free hair cut :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't entirely trust dispensary review websites such as weed maps at this point because of empirical knowledge. I went to a two dispensaries in durango and one in Colorado Springs that were rated very well and had lots of good reviews. I found that all three of those places (which I won't name) were very poor.

I was hoping someone would have some insight they can share instead of resorting to, what appears to be, arbitrary ratings and reviews.

	<TEXT> Depends one where you are honestly. I was riding up the lift with a ski patrol when the kid on the lift in front of us started smoking a bowl. I didn't notice until he said "That kid's having a real hard time lighting his bowl". We both chuckle and I ask him "Do you guys care if people smoke on the lifts?". He said "We don't bust anyone for smoking pot. Everyone will leave you be. You just need to watch out for the forest service guys."

It turns out that occasionally the forest service will send a few undercover officers to see how things are running (Wolf Creek is on National Forest) and will bust people for smoking. Just be mindful of where you are and what you are doing.  </TEXT>
