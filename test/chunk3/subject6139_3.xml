	<TEXT> That would be against the law. That's harassment, and unless he is a tall gentleman he would have to get me lower than his ass to fart in my face which would then be assault. Vaping doesn't Harass anyone nor does it assault anyone. If anyone has a serious problem with it and asks me to stop I would but not for some bullshit reason like "it's obnoxious" 
Your analogy was wayyy off bro </TEXT>

	<TEXT> PV's are not smoking cessation devices 
Some people use them as such but in all reality it's more of a safer alternative for smoking. If you smoked and you don't like it then buy a vape. If you think you could just quit all together then do that. If you want to vape but don't want a mic addiction anymore, buy 0mg nic liquids. 
TL;DR: vape ahead and don't care so much about what we think lol if you like it that's all that matters  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, other than the chemical imbalances, certain people build up a tolerance to devastation in their lives because of their situations. 
So someone from a safe pg environment takes tragedy a lot worse than someone who has had to learn how to accept and move on from tragedy quicker because it has happened to them so often 
It gets easier over time to deal with things once we learn to do so properly  </TEXT>

He plays characters that he could realistically play (the ones that are basically normal people) but he also plays characters that are larger than life. He then has to completely dive into a character that has almost nothing in common with himself such as the mad hatter or scissor hands or willy wonks where he has to change a larger portion of himself to play that part than he would to play a realistic character like in finding never land or tourist  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would suggest staying around the 7-9 watt range with that coil 

As long as you don't plan on rebuilding or doing anything with mechs then I wouldn't over think the resistance thing just yet. One step at a time ya know? 

I would start at 5 watts and slowly bump it up until you find your sweet spot, if it starts to taste burnt or is too hot for what you like, take it down some 

And I wouldn't go starting any addictions you don't have lol 18 isn't that high but it's pretty high for an occasional smoker. That would be why it is so harsh. I would at least go to 6mg if you like the way nicotine feels  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yea that's happened to about 3-4 of those in my house lol 
It's pretty common
The epoxy(sp.) that they use just kinda stops working and it comes out 
If no wires are hurt you can superglue it back on 

Edit: never mind one of the wires is severed 
If you wanted to you could splice the two pieces back together but I would just say get a new one lol  </TEXT>
