It's The eldritch vs Steampunk. 

ERB could do some fantastic background visuals as well.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My girlfriend and I are in the same group of friends at our high school and she is just as much "one of the group" as I am. Sometimes she will want to hang out with a singular guy friend. This bothers me and I've discussed it with her, but she has said that because she does not have very many female friends. This, although making sense, does not mean I am not bothered by her hanging out with male friends without me. Especially this one guy who I know likes her (he asked her out and she declined. This is before we started dating. ) 

She also does not want me to hang out with female friends without her because I am comfortable with friends of the same gender. 

How can I make her understand how I feel about this? I am not worried that she will leave me, but I still don't like this. Am I being controlling? I need advice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wtf is wrong with some people? I hear about stuff like this happening online occasionally and I just cannot imagine something anything like this occurring at my table. I run two campaigns. In one of them there is one female player and three males, the other one half the group is female. We have never had anything sexual occur ever, and certainly not anything to do with sexual assault.  This makes my blood boil. 

I'm sure you and your SO can find a group that doesn't feel the need to bring their own sexual frustration into a tabletop game. Fuck those hicks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm confused about the function of the Mind witnesses to a mind flayed hive. They are supposed to increase the speed of telepathic communication, but I thought that communication within the radius of the mother brain was instantaneous. Am I missing something? They're really cool. They're function just seems redundant. 

Aside from that, I love all the love mind flayers are getting. They are one of the coolest monsters ever and more lore on them is always awesome.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [5e] when a creature rolls a dice check, does their final roll have to exceed the listed number or meet it?

Example: a wizard casts thunder wave on some goblins. Her spell save DC is 14. Do the goblins have to roll a 14 on their saving throws? Or a 15? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was running my dark sun 5e campaign and my players genuinely surprised me with how evil they were. They were fighting off a death dog,(they are still second level) and our wizard defiler cast thunder wave in attempts to destroy it. Everyone was crowded around her and she didn't warn anyone beforehand. The death dog was scared away and our psion and our bard were reduced to zero hit points. 

Earlier that day, the psion had attempted to destroy the leader of a Thri-kreen tribe while the defiler was negotiating. (This was less an appropriate roleplaying and more being obnoxious because it's fun.) 

As our bard and psion were making death saving throws, the barbarian made a successful medicine check to stabilize the bard. Then, everyone looked down and watched as the psion failed his. When his character died, the psion's player stood up, handed me his character sheet and left, without saying a word. He looked quite distraught. I am a relatively new DM,(this is the second game I'm running) and I'm not really sure how to proceed. Any advice would be helpful, if I wasn't clear on any aspects of the event, feel free to ask and I will do my best to elaborate. Thank you in advance.  

Update: Thank you guys for the help, I've talked with the player in question and he wants to continue playing. We talked about the result of playing a character that doesn't work well in a group. He has decided to play a more lawful character and I don't think he will harbour any ill will.
