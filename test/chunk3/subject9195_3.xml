	<TEXT> Hey Guys!

[Album](http://imgur.com/gallery/uq3wt)

I'm trying to plan my workouts of the future, and I need some advice. I started my weight loss journey at 233.7 lbs (~15 lbs heavier than "before" photos) , I'm down to 176 lbs. I love lifting, and I should have good genetic potential to pack on muscle, but first, I want to get down to a low body fat percentage. I'm ok bulking up, and gaining some fat, but first, I wanted to get to a place where this is safe. I averaged out 7 body fat % calculators, and got an average of ~16%, but eliminating outliers,  (12.8%, 18.6%, 17%), it was closer to 14.87%. I would guess I'm somewhere in the 15-17% zone. (More stats inside the album)



My questions are:

1. what is your best guess as to what my body fat percentage is?

2. What is a good goal weight/ body fat percentage? (currently 176) 

3. Does it make sense to wait till I hit my goal (163 lbs ish) to start bulking?



-edit-

	<TEXT> Percussion nerd here, are your scores to those unfinished shows on Musescore? (if you don't know, you can upload to their site, which allows people to look at your scores, listen to them, and download them). I'm blown away by your arrangement; and I'm looking for some experience writing. I'm in High school, and thinking about going into composition. If you upload them, I'd love to write some percussion parts, and send them back to you, so you can use them (provided you don't hate my writing).  </TEXT>
