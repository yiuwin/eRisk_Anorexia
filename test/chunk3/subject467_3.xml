	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It was a school camping trip and we were put into groups of around 10 kids. We cooked our own (horrible) food each evening and had to wash and clean everything which was a ball ache given the facilities.

Obviously i would much rather spend this time tampering with people's tents or setting traps in the wooded area near the camp.

While i wasn't a fan of the food by any means I'm a pretty experienced camper so had no problem cooking up my cheap cheap burger on the shitty BBQ, the girls were all a bit disgusted by the ordeal.

With these two things in mind i came up with the idea of telling the girls in our group that there would be a takeaway pizza for the group that cleaned their cooking items the best. They hated the food and loved pizza so why shouldn't they believe it? Only problem was i still had to do activities with these lot so i bribed a friend (willing sap) to mention it to one of the girl's friend's outside of the group.

Of course the rumor spread like wildfire among every girl in the camp and that night's dishes and cooking implements were especially clean while i got to go any get high in the woods/steal alcohol from the teacher's gazebo.

The best bit was the day after when we had our assembly thing where everyone was waiting to see who would win the fake pizza prize (they were giving out little token prizes for those who did best in various activities) It got to the end of the prize giving with no mention of pizza (and another night of crappy food) which led to a mini girly riot. All because of me :). </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This came from noticing how the more interesting and possibly intelligent people around me conduct themselves in conversation. They ask a lot of questions but know when to stay quiet, only talking about themselves when asked about something specifically or when extremely relevant. 

Practicing this (especially trying to avoid starting every sentence with "I") there has been a noticeable difference in the amount of information people around give up willingly. It seems a lot of this has to do with the theory that people have to fill an awkward silence; if you give them an extra bit of gap after they finish their answer then inevitably they will attempt to fill the silence with more information. 

The possible reason for people finding you more interesting if you say less simply comes down to the fact that people love to talk about themselves. Their experiences are fascinating, they know they are; they were there!

What are your revelations, small or large that have changed how you place when conversing? 

If nothing else try this: Count how many times the person you next speak to starts a sentence with "I". It will drive you mad. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A small TV production company could do with some advice! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-07 18:00:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After a colleague left last week i have kind of inherited the role of looking after the eight edit suites, facilities and kit of a UK based production company. Since starting in November of last year I've got a fairly good idea of how things are working but since kind of being left to it things have slipped a bit and I'm getting called up on small mistakes here and there that add up to not such a good picture. Areas for improvement are obvious but the implementation less so. I turn to this lovely community of producers and creatives for ideas!

-=

The company is split onto three floors. Downstairs are the 8 edit suites and facilities while upstairs are the offices for admin, research and development.  

-=

**AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT 1: STORAGE**. Each edit suite is equipped with Avid and FCP and has attached to it a 21Tb RAID drive for storing media files. We also have a large but old server to back up files and lots of smaller caddy's and external drives that get moved form computer to computer and confused. This is where i struggle to see a solution. the RAID arrays work okay but there are too many drives floating around. If we were to invest in a better infrastructure for storage where should we start?

-=

**AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT 2: FILES**. There are a lot of documents going around that get very confusing. We have a central location that the office lot have where they can upload/download files but it seems to get really messy with 20 people sticking things wherever "makes sense" at the time. Also editing these is a nightmare as they have to download and re-upload things constantly. Perhaps a cloud based solution is in order, any recommendations?

-=

**AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT 3: KIT**. We have a few cameras and kits of various levels including a Red One, a PDW F800, 5D mk3, EX3 and some older cameras like the DSR and a Z1. To go with these are various boom mics, radio mics etc. I've had trouble coming up with a system that ensures we know where everything is at all times. The solution so far was to just have a master list and copy items onto a carnet for each individual shoot.

-=

This was a lot more than i hoped to say but maybe there are people out there that can give a bit of wisdom on any of these issues! Its all been very ad-hoc up until now so i'm hoping to put things in order somewhat. Thanks in advance you beautiful film-makers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the moment for various reasons pertaining to money i am working seven days a week with fairly long hours. Obviously this saves money but has kind of cut down on relaxation time. 

Averaging about 7 and a half hours sleep a night at the moment it would be great to claw back a couple of hours here and there just to spend a bit of extra time on conscious activities!

Does anyone have any tricks or tips to cut down on my sleeping time a little bit. I've taken up 20 minute naps or so on my lunch break but i still find myself resenting leaving the bed in the morning despite 6 or 7 hours sleep. </TEXT>

I don't have a lot of experience with this but it like a lot of things it needs sorting out. Where do i start though? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mountain bikes. Mountain bikes have been my life for the past few years. Today my "town" bike was stolen from my house, a nice Rockhopper that has been amazing as a second bike on the trails and incredible for zipping around my (very hilly) town.

The first instinct was to start saving up again for a hard-tail to thrash about town but i'm starting to get curious about road bikes. Its an area i'm not familiar with and a fairly low budget (350ish) so second hand is definitely the way i'll be going. 

What should i look out for when buying road bikes second hand? What to look for in terms of fitting (i assume a little more important that mountain bikes)? What makes and models are a good shout for zipping around town with maybe a bit of pleasure cycling at the weekends? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I am going for a modelling test shoot on Sunday. I'm not very fashionable and they want 6 different "looks". Help!? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-07-17 18:32:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So basically i submitted some profiles to some modelling websites because someone told me to. I didn't think much of it but i got a call back last week and I'm booked in for a three hour test shoot this Sunday. 

They asked me to bring 6 different looks to show off my versatility. The problem is I'm not very fashionable and super poor so buying new clothes is out the window (even though i haven't bought new stuff in a few years.) I have the usual attire, shirts, jeans tees but i'm struggling a bit with how to come up with more than a couple of "looks" as it were. 

So far i have:

Sporty mountain bike gear: Shorts, baselayer tee, gloves
Smart: Black trousers, shirt and Jacket.
Casual: Jeans, shirt.
Underpants: Underpants (If they let me)

Then i get stuck. Like I said this is really quite new to me and i could really do with the extra cash if i somehow pull it off! Any ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Surely savoury is a collective term for all favours that are not sweet? Umami is specifically a flavour that isn't salty, bitter or spicy etc. 

Unsmoked Bacon is a good example that flavour under the sadness can also be found in mushrooms and other foods and have so called umami flavours. It's not to say we don't use the flavour in western cooking, we haven't started calling it what it is until recently as eastern countries have been for ages.  </TEXT>

The conversation turned to another person's account of a girl that was supposedly taken behind some club and raped by a couple of doorman (bouncer) that were working on the door that night. As the conversation took this dark turn everyone went quiet and someone asked my friend Ben if he had seen anything like that happen in his time as a bouncer. His answer: "I've never been that lucky". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm hoping this will be relevant enough that some of you current professionals will have the time to give some anecdotal and general advice on the industry today.

Like any creative field it seems that you just need to be practicing, putting out material and meeting people; but with such a complex field and specialized positions, I'm sure everyone will agree it can be a tough nut to crack.

I'm writing this from a fairly selfish perspective as i am exploring options to get into the industry. As a recent graduate i have been working as an edit assistant to a TV company and while i have managed to get a fer graphics projects under my belt its all been very quick turnaround affairs in Cinema 4D and After effects. 

So how did you get into the industry? What are the tools an aspiring computer graphics artist should be learning right now? And how do you set yourself apart from all the trends set by tutorials and amazing array of inspiration on the web? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beardyman is incredibly diverse and after seeing him play with JFB with live video scratching, various festivals and lots of brilliant videos i have to say the best gig i have ever been to was him playing with a 21 piece orchestra.

Basically very similar to this but entirely improvised; he would act as a kind of involved conductor spouting off little riffs and pointing to sections of the orchestra to get them to play their parts, start and stop. It was everything from jazz to hardcore drum and bass without ever slipping up or hitting a dead end. 

If you ever have the opportunity to see him live you will not regret it; a perfect blend of showmanship, humor and a bafflingly good ear for the interesting and unusual. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Altered Carbon by Richard Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon). With the right director it would be the perfect cyberpunk film noir feature length film. It almost reads like a movie script and its impossible not to picture Blade Runner-esque scenes with each chapter.

In case anyone is wondering it takes place on in 700 years where humans have colonized various worlds and an individual's consciousness is stored in a fairly resilient microchip that is implanted at the base of the skull instead of the brain. When you die (is you can afford it or have insurance) this chip is retrieved and implanted into a new body. The story revolves around the implications and possibilities of a world with this reality. </TEXT>

--

Welcome to subject467's body, please dont make a mess.

Dont go to work: on bad days i barely know myself what i'm doing.

You have three housemates, Mikey will just talk and talk, Sam will make clever quips and Radek is polish. They probably wont notice if you just have a smoke with them and talk about space and philosophy.

Dont look in the wardrobe.

There are plenty of tasty treats in the fridge on the left but you've had a funny tummy recently so dont fart with too much confidence. 

Laura is coming over later, she's pissed off at you so just listen about her week and give her a massage until she falls asleep. She will request steak, dont try and cook it; anything less than steak perfection will arouse suspicion, Sugest mexican takeaway.

I guess you can get fresh with her but we had a pretty kinky evening planned so do so at you're own risk.

Have fun and dont do anything i wouldn't do! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know about that. It depends what you're into but there are some brilliant BBC docs being made at the moment on all manner of subjects. I have incredible respect for Louis Theroux and David Attenburough and the teams in Bristol are always looking for new ways to film things with plants and creatures. Many find him a bit outspoken but I really enjoy Adam Curtis' documentaries too.

Elsewhere to look are places like vbs.tv, the site is balls though so it takes a bit of digging around for the good stuff. 

There are still great docs being made its just the intelligent people that make them (who aren't tied to a channel) are moving away from TV as a medium. For TV is dead.  </TEXT>
