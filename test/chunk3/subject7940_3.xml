	<TEXT> It has been online for one year and it has like a hundred works of a dozen of artists, but since January it is under some reforms like the addition of a HTTPS certificate, facilitations for the upload formulars and now I am working on an app and I am going to start to translate it soon.

It is ready to receive multimedia files and it has plenty of papers, texts, some videos and mostly images; as I have a nice music player available, I am looking for good quality indie songs to enhance the experience: songs like yours would fit perfectly to it.

As soon as it is "readier", I talk to you again, my friend. </TEXT>

Try the tag [JOB] to attract some attention; [WIP] sounds more like an "early-access" thing, rather to show a part of the work or to ask for some guidance.

And, other thing, pay attetion to [OC] posts, as you can take a look at "samples" and also make contact with the poster directly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much, /u/sethpaxton, for your attention and kind words!

You can always see all my works on my website, which displays works of any nowadays artist/scientist: [Quaestio.org](https://quaestio.org); mine are all [here](https://quaestio.org/objects/vargas-freitas-jorge-americo/); and on pixelart, you can access directly [here](https://quaestio.org/objects/pixelart/); last, there is another on this series, a room in the building, not pixelart, but if you want to see it: [1/4](https://quaestio.org/1-4/).

I used to start my works on Microsof Paint and complete them on Adobe Photoshop, but, now I am tending to work fully on a program, so my latest works are "purer" in a sense.

Finally, it is interesting that you mentioned "more of *my* works" because, after I developed this website, firstly, I started to produce at least one file per month, but then I realized I had to call more people to see them (for instance, I completed the last one and I had like 10 accesses in the day with a lot of effort); so, this year is being dedicated mostly on its development and final adjustments.

Reddit in itself and mainly good users of /r/pixelart (like you, my friend) are pushing me back to pixels, so I am restarting to think about delayed inspirations and even a simple game: I just need to make the network starts to work by itself before I am able to. </TEXT>

Well, the webstie is under reforms, so I have not been able to deal with all the details yet, my friend, as I am doing it alone while I learn how to.

I would like to enforce the moral aspects of autorship, so I tought it would be nice to have a screen to present the work before showing it; by the way, this template test is kind of incomplete by now since I plan to add a button to do the scroll for the user. </TEXT>

As I commented [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/4miji5/occc_constante/d3y9i7c):

 (It) is about how the oddity of one fits in the middle of the pattern of even numbers and it also depicts a 51% green-blue painted screen in which a manual gradient between black and white pixelating it resulted into a glossy effect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That would be genuine, /u/aLamprey: let me know if you start to work on that.

I have asked you that because I was not understanding the reason of the title (*V* instead of a suggestive *X*) and the domino concept was what made me realize it (*V* as *5*).

About the textures, what caught my attention the most were the circles; they could be much simpler, just plain shapes; then, the textures added a lot to it: congratulations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the support, my friend!

I started painting with MS Paint and, to create some order in the bitmap, I used to generate multiple rules so that measurements could be facilitated.

Then, I always noticed interesting patterns like this one, that served me practically as a palette for squares organized by the size of the power of two, and I started to pay more attention to these ideas lately.

The [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/4mtq8i/occc_transparente/) work is about how the oddity of one fits in the middle of the pattern of even numbers and it also depicts a 51% green-blue painted screen in which a manual gradient between black and white pixelating it resulted into a glossy effect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice combination of ingredients, /u/Hexadder: I like it.

My friend, this is an abstract work about something that I realized playing with pixels.

The squares grows relatively to the power of two, so what we see is a crescent growth; a next step in this progression would need three more squares, one for each color, and each one of they would have the same size of the screen: 1024x1024px.

This work is a part of a collection in which I am exploring geometry and mathematics with pixels: [Mathemetria](https://quaestio.org/objects/mathemetria/); there is another one of it already posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/4mtq8i/occc_transparente/). </TEXT>

I was not talking about your proposal, but criticizing the draw in itself.

What I liked the most is how the draw is simple and the masks are being used in an atmosphere of silent normality.

I mean, the conjunction between the style of the draw and the dystopian behavior creates an absurd scenario of a type of conformism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for your support!

Honestly, I try to be coherent with good sense while developing it alone, but it is much more important to have good correspondence from others.

A project like this lurks in the shadows of the "*off-off-underground*", then, it is difficult to reach the mainstream audience and, consequently, some feedback.

Now, [Quaestio.org](https://quaestio.org) is passing for some reforms in order to improve and facilitate its services, always trying to follow a conceptual lead guided by the essence of art and technic.

Kind words like yours add good energies to the project, so I need to invite you to follow its development by [mail](https://quaestio.org/registry/subscription/) or [social media](https://quaestio.org/e/media/) as you will.

So, I must thank you more than twice, /u/ksushashiny! </TEXT>
