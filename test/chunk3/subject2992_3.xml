	<TEXT> He had to pay like $80,000 and it ended up being ruled out as a misdemeanor. They almost made it a felony charge because of the amount of damage, but the team on the case decided that they didn't want there to be a whole media uproar, so they went with misdemeanor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anorexia nervosa isn't only not eating. That could be due to depression, anxiety, eating disorders categorized into EDNOS/OSFED, etc. I was checking the physical and emotional symptoms: hair loss, lanugo growth, dizziness/lightheadedness   fainting, loss of or irregular periods, low blood pressure, racing or slow resting heart rate, fatigue, headaches, dehydration, fear of gaining weight, fear of certain foods, etc. Anorexia nervosa is so much more than just simply "not eating." Anorexia (and all eating disorders) are the most fatal compared to any other mental illness. Also, anorexia has a strict criteria to be diagnosed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I took so many quizzes and read so much stuff about all my symptoms. Every single thing I looked at said that I had or was at serious risk for anorexia nervosa. I knew I had an eating disorder, but I didn't think it was so serious. Turned out the online diagnosis was right. I found out when I had to go to the ER after nearly collapsing due to dehydration, low blood sugar, electrolyte imbalance, and lack of food intake. So the lesson is that if you really match the symptoms to something online, go see your doctor. And just so you all know, I'm currently in treatment and pretty stable. </TEXT>
