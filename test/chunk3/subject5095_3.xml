Vincent: It's not. It's the same ballpark.
Jules: Ain't no fucking ballpark neither. Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but, you know, touching his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies ain't the same fucking ballpark. It ain't the same league. It ain't even the same fucking sport. Look, foot massages don't mean shit.
Vincent: Have you ever given a foot massage?
Jules: Don't be telling me about foot massages, I'm the foot fuckin' master.
Vincent: Given a lot of them?

	<TEXT> It was fantastic.  I was at first worried that the wrestlers would half-ass it, but most of them, especially the top 10-15 or so, were really going at it.  Hakuho especially looked like he was there to show everyone who the boss is.  He tossed Kotoshogiku like a rag doll in their match-up, and didn't take crap from anyone else.  In the end it was Hakuho vs. Harumafuji, with Hakuho coming out on top in a fairly even match, though I would have been shocked if Hakuho hadn't prevailed with the way he'd been blowing up everyone else.

What was especially great about this one-day tournament is that if your favorites got through the first round, you got to see them go at it again.  And the match-ups just kept getting better and better.  So for instance with some like Hakuho, Harumafuji, and Kotoshogiku, you got to see them perform a few times within an hour.  Definitely not your normal day at sumo.

So, comparing it to a regular tournament day, it didn't have perhaps the same level of excitement that a day late in a tourney would have when much more was on the line, but you could definitely sense that there was a lot of pride on the line at this thing, and many brought their A-game.

Other highlights were, as someone else posted in the sumo forum, some bouts from retired sumo wrestlers.  That was fun to watch.  The "comedy" bouts with kids was interesting because almost all the kids they brought out were white.  Don't know where they came from -- maybe an international school.

The view from my seat was like this:

Anyway, great day.  Would definitely go again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The part about be a dad is going to be really tough for him.  I'm going through that right now with chronic back problems, and trying to explain to my three-year-old girl why I can't pick her up and play like we used to is very hard both literally and emotionally.  What would probably help is if you can be on the lookout for those moments when he might feel "stuck" not knowing what to do when it comes to the demands that a little kid can make.  For myself, at least once a day my girl wants me to do something that I just can't do.  Luckily my wife tries to step in and either suggests something else they can do, or tries to explain that dad hurts (or in our language, has an "ouchie") and just can't play right now.

It is tough emotionally, though.  I'm sure your SO wants to be a good dad just as badly as I do.  I feel for the guy, especially since with two kids he probably faces twice as many moments when he wants to be a normal father, but just can't.  You have to watch and make sure he doesn't try and do too much, because that will just multiply the pain and frustration down the road.  He has to know his limits and learn to accept them, and you have to respect those and be supportive as much as you can. </TEXT>
