	<TEXT> actually I checked my computer specs yesterday (its been awhile) and was surprised. It has a i7 processor, 8 gb, and a SSD. I'm planning on keeping it. The only upgrade I need would be another harddrive to replace the cd drive to add more room on my mac.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who has been playing for over a decade, I would never buy something like this. maybe it would help some people, but learning to read tab, chords, etc is valuable. I feel like this is another gimmick trying to get new players to believe they can play much faster without the frustration. There is no shortcut, learning can be very frustrating sometimes. Its a long process, it takes patience and hard work. If you have enough money, get a good teacher. One on one lessons with a good teacher is far superior then a computer or gimmick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> bought a a 2012 macbook pro in 2013 and run photoshop, Ableton,etc on it. Im returning to school soon and will need to use Adobe apps  for graphic design, photo editing, wed dev, etc. Anyways will 2012 MacBooks soon be lagging behind.
