	<TEXT> Thank you! I'm sorry you have yo-yod with your weight; it truly is the worst. I did take your advice and I have a friend coming over tomorrow night for a movie :) She knows I have an issue with this and has enough interpersonal intelligence to not comment on my weight. 
Was it a lot harder to lose the weight after being overweight? Mentally, it is for me just because I think my brain knows what starving is like but how about physically? My weight is coming off so slow.
