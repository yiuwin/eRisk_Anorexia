	<TEXT> A modified comic-based version of our mascot [was posted today](http://np.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/285lgn/just_remember_none_of_us_can_control_the/) in /r/Writing, and most of the thread's comments are thankfully assailing everything about it.  Not everyone is on board, however -- enter /u/FACT_CHECKING_ALIEN:

 **[To be fair,](http://np.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/285lgn/just_remember_none_of_us_can_control_the/ci7nwdv?context=3)** I'm pretty sure that a not-insignificant number of us had horrible English teachers that did exactly this. Either in high school or college. The sheer overwhelming number of such sentiments *suggests it*.

 As a growing author myself, though I doubt if ever a successful one, I sure as hell loathe the idea of some group of idiots deciding I meant anything other than ["The curtains were blue"](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iTRZNhZGJkE/TdjpS-44TrI/AAAAAAAAAJg/LS2aJFqLCL0/s1600/english.jpg).

and

 **[Really?](http://np.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/285lgn/just_remember_none_of_us_can_control_the/ci7nxv0?context=4)** A wirters intent doesn't matter? Great!

 I hereby declare Gandhi a warmonger and all of his written pieces involving pacifism were to sturr up violent extremeism among pacifists to all out war!

Each thread continues for a while, pretty much how you'd expect.

There's also [this gem](http://np.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/285lgn/just_remember_none_of_us_can_control_the/ci7pmwg) from someone else later on in the comments:

 My favourite subject at school was English language. My least favourite by far was English literature, because of all the bullshit we had to read into the interpretation of literary works.

 The analysis squeezed the life out of the work and removed all the pleasure I might have had from reading those works. It ensured that once I left school I never read another literary work again.

Which articles have surprised you with their comprehensiveness and utility?  Which ones have dismayed you with their bias, incoherence or even just brevity?  Finally, if you're involved in editing articles there yourself, what sort of behind-the-scenes conflict have you seen when it comes to pages in your field? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I happened to pick up a second-hand copy of his *The Shadow of the Sun* the other day, which is an account of his experience covering certain de-/post-colonization moments in a variety of African nations.  The work seems to be very well-reviewed, and I've been enjoying it so far -- but it's very far out of my field, and I am curious as to his (or even just the book's) reputation as far as these subjects go.  He seems to have written several books about African matters, including a biography of sorts of the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie that I'd also like to check out.

But before I do that... what do you think? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The history of the "fictional POTUS" has always fascinated me. It's a character who recurs frequently in modern art, from the succession of Presidents on *24* to Jed Bartlett on *The West Wing* to the endless string of Presidents weathering various apocalypses in disaster movies. There have also been plenty of real Presidents who have appeared as characters in various works -- whether incidentally, as with something like Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR in *Pearl Harbor*, or as a direct focus, as with Daniel Day-Lewis' performance in the title role in *Lincoln*.

How did all of this begin, though? What are the earliest examples in each case?

	<TITLE> To tide us over between submissions -- what is the most infuriating or baffling claim about literature or literary studies you've come across in a well-regarded work? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are wide-ranging abstract posts like this in /r/BadHistory fairly regularly, and I imagine there's room for them here as well.

So: what sort of nonsense have you across while reading otherwise informed or prominent people's opinions about literature and literary studies?  Have you found a particularly disparaging remark from a STEM scholar?  A bewildering mischaracterization from an historian?  Or even a literary scholar going way too far in something, for whatever reason?

I'd sure like to hear about these and similar things, if you have any at hand. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [AMA] Dr. James McPherson, author of 'Battle Cry of Freedom' (1988) and over a dozen other books on the American Civil War, will be doing an AMA in /r/AskHistorians this Friday, Feb. 28th, starting at 1:30PM </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-25 00:44:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **EDIT: 1:30PM EST**, to be clear.

First, I hope this sort of cross-promotion is acceptable here.  I have a great respect for the community that you've developed here in /r/CredibleDefense, and I would not wish to post something that would run counter to your expectations.

Assuming it's alright, however:

[Dr. McPherson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M._McPherson) should need no introduction to those of you who have made the Civil War a subject of particular study.  He is the author of numerous books on the war, the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, and other related subjects -- most recently *War on the Waters: The Union   Confederate Navies, 1861-1865* (2012).  Dr. McPherson won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for *Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era* (1988), has served on the editorial board of *Encyclopedia Britannica*, as the president of the American Historical Association, and as the George Henry Davis '86 Professor Emeritus at Princeton.  We are very excited to welcome him to /r/AskHistorians, and hope that you will have many interesting questions to ask.

The format of Dr. McPherson's AMA will differ somewhat from our typical ones in that it will be less "real-time" than usual; the top questions submitted by readers will be sent to him via e-mail, and his answers posted later that afternoon via a registered account with the help of one of our mods.  Dr. McPherson is not yet familiar with Reddit from the inside out, but he's keen to talk with everyone here all the same; we're happy to be able to help.

I hope you will join us this Friday for Dr. McPherson's AMA, and in welcoming him to /r/AskHistorians.

Our thanks go out to **/u/anastik** for helping get this set up.  We appreciate it immensely! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> AMA Announcement -- Dr. James McPherson, author of 'Battle Cry of Freedom' (1988) and over a dozen other books on the American Civil War, will be here to answer questions this Friday, Feb. 28th, starting at 1:30PM </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-24 23:56:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **EDIT: 1:30PM EST**

[Dr. McPherson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M._McPherson) should need no introduction to those of you who have made the Civil War a subject of particular study.  He is the author of numerous books on the war, the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, and other related subjects -- most recently *War on the Waters: The Union   Confederate Navies, 1861-1865* (2012).  Dr. McPherson won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for *Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era* (1988), has served on the editorial board of *Encyclopedia Britannica*, as the president of the American Historical Association, and as the George Henry Davis '86 Professor Emeritus at Princeton.  We are very excited to welcome him to /r/AskHistorians, and hope that you will have many interesting questions to ask.

The format of Dr. McPherson's AMA will differ somewhat from our typical ones in that it will be less "real-time" than usual; the top questions submitted by readers will be sent to him via e-mail, and his answers posted later that afternoon via a registered account with the help of one of our mods.  Dr. McPherson is not yet familiar with Reddit from the inside out, but he's keen to talk with everyone here all the same; we're happy to be able to help.

I hope you will join us this Friday for Dr. McPherson's AMA, and in welcoming him to /r/AskHistorians.

Our thanks go out to **/u/anastik** for helping get this set up.  We appreciate it immensely! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why was there a sudden burst in the 1890s through 1950s of authors and academics publishing under their initials rather than their full names? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-13 17:10:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The 1890s through 1950s span for this is admittedly a bit messy, but it does encompass when these authors were largely at their most active.  It seems to have been comparatively rare during the height of the Victorian era, and also seems to have dropped off considerably as we approach the "modern" age.  To get some idea of what I mean, consider this non-exhaustive list:

- A.C. Benson
- E.F. Benson
- R.H. Benson (these three are admittedly brothers)
- A.C. Bradley
- E.M.W. Tillyard
- A.E.W. Mason
- C.R.M.F. Cruttwell
- C.S. Forester
- C.S. Lewis
- G.K. Chesterton
- J.R.R. Tolkien
- D.H. Lawrence
- T.E. Lawrence
- I.A. Richards
- F.R. Leavis
- A.J.P. Taylor
- E.H. Carr
- E.P. Thompson
- G.M. Trevelyan
- F.R. Scott
- E.B. White
- R.F.C. Fuller
- B.K. Sandwell
- W.K. Wimsatt
- W.R. Titterton
- A.E. Housman
- C.E. Montague
- T.S. Eliot
- F.S. Flint
- T.E. Hulme
- H.H. Asquith
- H.G. Wells
- H.P. Lovecraft
- A.P. Herbert
- H.M. Tomlinson
- H.H. Munro (though he more commonly published as "Saki")
- T.H. White
- E.M. Forster

I can think of a very few earlier cases of this -- C.P. Scott, T.H. Huxley, W.S. Gilbert, for example.  

I am fully prepared to discover that this is a problem on my end caused by an over-familiarity with people active during this time period and a more hazy engagement with the ones before and after, but there does seem to be something of a trend here.  If there is, what might have caused it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I've read that, on Feb. 25th of 1917, a German destroyer was dispatched to shell Lord Northcliffe's country home in Kent with the intention of assassinating him. Do we know *which* destroyer this was? [x-post from /r/WWI] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-29 21:59:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The shelling, at least, seems to be well-attested, as Northcliffe's gardener's wife was killed in the attack and some of the shell damage can still be seen at Elmwood, but none of the sources I've seen mention it provide any useful information about the ship that would have been involved.  

Who was in command?  Did the crew know the full details of their mission?  And do we know that the targeting of Elmwood really was deliberate?  That such a focused attack could be made in the first place would not surprise me, given the extraordinary degree of contempt in which Northcliffe was held by the German high command, but it's still too provocative a story to be simply taken for granted. </TEXT>
