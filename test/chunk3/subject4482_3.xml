	<TEXT> Conversely, while I was purchasing a pair of headphones from Challenger a couple years ago, one of the staff came to me and asked, "What are you gonna use these for? Gaming ah?" In a casual but clearly patronising tone. I replied "No, just for listening to music lor, these are very good headphones" and then he went on about how it's not necessarily good because people have different preferences blah blah blah then he went to over to another staff telling him about how many people have been buying that pair of headphones in a salty tone (???) I mean you're a store don't you want people to buy your products?

Yes I get it, the ATH-M50x are studio monitors; they weren't made with the purpose of personal listening. That doesn't mean I can't enjoy its sound signature. I'm about to make a $200+ purchase so rest assured that I've done my fair share of research before stepping into the store.  </TEXT>

I'd want to befriend Hanabi Kawai. If you read the manga you'll know that she actually had a pretty sad childhood, albeit she doesn't seem affected by it at all. So I'd really wanna make it up for her.

As for girlfriend, that's Nozomi for sure 3 Cheerful, friendly, passionate about her interest, hardworking, financially responsible, smart and innovative, that's just wife material right there. I mean, honestly, if Nozomi exist IRL, you could never go wrong in life living together with her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So others should suffer so they can play?  The self entitlement goes both ways.

They did what's best for themselves without breaking the rules or finding loopholes. They just did what is and will continue to be allowed. It's hard not to find you ridiculous when you're complaining about something that's not against the rules or anything and it's always been this way.

Most of the worldwide available free-to-play online games have region locking.

And what's stopping me from playing on NA servers? At least that's what me and everyone else I know IRL does for Hearthstone. True or not, people here say that players on the local server provide no challenge so I just went with the flow. Hearthstone doesn't require teamwork or communication for obvious reasons, or else I would have already heard you complaining about this as well.

To be fair I understand it puts you off but if you can't provide a practical, reasonable solution you'll just end up sounding like a whiny spoilt child.

Whether or not you find those reasons stupid, illogical, ridiculous, whatever, that's all just from your perspective. There's no way Peruvians would play on US servers if it doesn't mean a better experience for them, so who are you to tell them to not play on US servers? Unless you're really self-entitled enough to suggest that they should suffer just so you can enjoy. If you don't like your bubble to be burst then what are you doing playing a worldwide available free-to-play online game?

	<TEXT> It's different, I don't like her because of her physical appearance. If I wanted someone sexually attractive there are tons of anime girls out there that beat Nozomi in that aspect. I used to have a fetish for "dark" girls e.g. Esdeath, Rize (Tokyo Ghoul), Elsa Granhiert (Re:Zero) but ultimately that's my testosterone talking. Nozomi is probably the most plain-looking anime character, not to mention a protagonist. Yet her personality is so loveable to me that all those I've said simply don't matter no more.

I want Nozomi. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a crush on Nozomi. It has been a few days since I finished the anime and now I just feel empty inside. Thinking about her cheerful, pure, passionate smile that's always on her face just warms my heart a little. But I also feel kinda (sexually?) confused about this feeling towards an anime character.. I mean, life goes on but I find myself thinking about her whenever I can and liking it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it just kinda stops standing out after like episode 3. 

It only stood out to me *after* episode 3. That's when I realize it's not a mindless ecchi and became engaged in the story. If you feel the reverse, perhaps sexualized anime girls are exactly what appeals to you?

	<TEXT> If Keijo is to exist in our world it would be very mild compared to the anime/manga where physics is obviously distorted in that universe. If that's the case, I wouldn't really be against it. But then again if my daughter could defy physics instead I'd let her have her own say.

This post is either a bad troll attempt or a self-absorbed one but here's my serious answer anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tbh I watched Keijo with the assumption that it's gonna be a low-effort, completely fanservice anime targeted at pubescent boys with raging hormones just to see how stupid it is. For a show that revolves around curvy girls in swimsuits fighting each other with their boobs and butts, it really has surprisingly little fanservice. Instead, it has good action, decent story and well developed characters. Overall an engaging, fun-filled comedy adventure. I'd personally say that it's a great sport anime especially when the sport doesn't even exist.  </TEXT>

Turns out it's quite the opposite. You can't experience the magic of multiple balanced armature drivers in headphones that high-end IEMs use, at least not with our current technology. </TEXT>
