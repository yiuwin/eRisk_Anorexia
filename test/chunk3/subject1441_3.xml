	<TEXT> I identify with this so much. When there is too much food in the house I get incredibly anxious to the point that I sometimes start throwing stuff out. Which makes me feel wasteful which makes me worry when there is too much food. It's an awful cycle.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I don't have any advice for you but I just wanted to respond and let you know that you aren't alone. I have the same problem right now. My therapist suggests trying to pin point why you need to overcompensate. Like what purpose it serves you now. It served a purpose at one time when you were actively restricting but now it isn't useful. Easier said than done though. Stay strong!  :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do I stop this relapse? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-20 22:53:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Short version of my story is that I am about 2 months into my formal recovery from anorexia (working with a therapist and living at home with my parents). I was doing so well. I mean don't get me wrong, eating more has been hard as hell but I was making progress and am nearing half way to my restored weight. Last Monday, after my appointment, though, something just snapped in my brain and I had uncontrollable urges to restrict and over exercise. I have been indulging in these for a week, and I'm starting to get back to that dark place where all I can think of is food and I beat myself up over a few extra calories. Does anyone have any advice on how to break this mini relapse and get back to gaining instead of losing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> News coming out of this part od the world should be taken with a grain of salt so you do have a point.  However, it is entirely possible for a virus to decline naturally.  

If there aren't enough succeptible hosts left, infection rates will drop.  This doesn't mean that there aren't still large populations which could be sickened; it just means there aren't enough spacially and temporally located to allow for the exponential growth we were previously seeing.  The 1918 flu eventually burnt itself out.  It was a much larger scale and a different virus, but the concepts are the same.

That being said, we won't know for sure for a few more months as other posters have said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think this point is really being made by anyone.  No one is saying that the quarentine is a bad idea because Ebola will get in anyway.  People, including myself, are arguing that the quarentine is harmful in that it reduces the pool of potential volunteers in Africa.  This has not an 'oh, well, it's gonna happen anyway so fuck it' type situation.  The bottom line is that there is no scientific basis for quarentining asymptotic HCW's.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That figure also doesn't include mild cases where the profuse symptoms aren't present.  From what I've read, some people will mount an immune response and fend off the virus with few if any symptoms.  These people are not infectious since their bodies don't allow for a large viral load to ever occur.  More research needs to be done to confirm this, but it proven true, it would significantly drop that mortality rate statistic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another thread on here referenced the fact that the r0 for Ebola (in Liberia) drops below 1 when traditional burial practices don't take place.  If we reach the end of the incubation period with no new infections in Mali, I think that will really help demonstrate this fact to people.  It probably won't change the burial culture, but we can hope.  At the very least, it will hopefully help to mitigate unfounded panic about secondary transmission in other parts of the world. </TEXT>
