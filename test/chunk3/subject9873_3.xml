	<TEXT> Obligatory "not me but":
My brother and I both went trick or treating one year, and there was one yard that just had a bowl of candy, a scarecrow, and someone sitting their at the porch (I assume to make sure people only took one, idk) so my brother went up and got some candy, and the scarecrow jumped out at him. He remembered their address, so he looked it up on white pages and basically found out all the personal information of the guy who jumped out at him. Later, in the wintertime, he saw the guy (who I'll nickname Joel for privacy reasons) shoveling snow in his driveway and he said "Hey (Joel)!" and the guy turned around with the most confused look on his face because this random-ass kid he didn't know had just confronted him as if he was his neighbor/coworker/friend </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The absolute best free video editor I've used is Videopad. It's easy to use, and has a decent amount of features (but not the insane amount of bells and whistles you get on professional video editors) and it can be kind of slow, but as long as you have at least a semi-decent computer it should run just fine. </TEXT>
