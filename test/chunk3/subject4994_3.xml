	<TEXT> Hey Blogging Redditers, 

I am pretty new to blogging and am nowhere close to mastering it, yet. I feel like I am always learning new things. 

I just want to ask you all what are the 3 most important things you did for your blog to make it grow (get followers). 

I am struggling to grow my blog, and while it is quite young (I started it in October), I am hoping to get constant traffic to it. 

My goal right now is pretty small, but I want to get my views up to 100 per day. Any advice would be helpful! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  not quite sure what event discovery is, could you expand a little on what it is and maybe I can help you out somewhat.

Thanks for the tips. I'll edit my post to clarify event discovery, but by event discovery, I mean that we provide an event calendar so people can find fun things to do on the weekend, for a date night, to hang out with friends, etc. Such events could be concerts, comedy shows, festivals, plays, ballets, sports events, 5k's, etc.

We have multiple calendars, and city specific calendars. If you want to check it out on your own to get a better idea, you can go to [our website](https://spingo.com/calendar). </TEXT>

What is the best way to share it? I have a very limited reach with social media right now, unless of course, you are suggesting paid reach.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Reddit SEOers, 

I am fairly new to the SEO world, and the one issue I am really finding challenging is generating backlinks. How am I supposed to increase the amount of backlinks pointing towards my site? 

I am looking for white-hat only answers. I have read a lot of blogs that talk about the importance of backlinks, but none specifically say how to get them. Are the only ways to generate backlinks to either to:

* Write guest blog posts
* Have somebody mention you in an article/blog post

Like I said, any good tips would be appreciated! I work for a company that does event discovery, so the actual content of our site is constantly changing and are items that can be talked about frequently. 

**Edit**--- By event discovery, I mean that we provide an event calendar so people can find fun things to do on the weekend, for a date night, to hang out with friends, etc. Such events could be concerts, comedy shows, festivals, plays, ballets, sports events, 5k's, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the reason Neal faked his death was because of something that Keller mentioned earlier in the episode.

When the two of them are sitting in the back of the prisoner van after being fake arrested, Keller tells Neal that the government will always find a way to keep Neal around, that even with the guarantee of his freedom, something would come up where the government wouldn't fully let him go. 

I think Neal knew this was true, but like Neal, he was always one step ahead of everybody. He had anticipated this, and he knew Keller would recommend it. 

Neal had planned his own death because Neal would never truly be free. He had a criminal record, a history, and a name that would be recognized and followed everywhere he went. The only way to truly get freedom was to die. 

This way Neal had a clean slate. The government thought he was dead, his friends thought he was dead, and so there would be no more chasing Neal Caffrey. It was the only way to become a free man.

But what Neal said at the end to Peter before being put into the ambulance was true. Peter was his best friend, and there is no way Neal would go the rest of his life without talking to Peter again. Neal just had to escape and lay low for a while and let it all seem so real. If he hadn't Peter would have never given up going after him. 

In the end, we are left to imaging Neal and Peter and Mozzie all meeting up and hanging out at some future point. The best friends together again.

EDIT: Not to mention the Pink Panthers would have been searching for Neal the rest of his life. He would have been running forever, not something that he wanted to do anymore. He had to fake his death to be free.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Staying in Sugarhouse is an option as well. There are a few bars and good restaurants over in the neighborhood. It is also easy to access downtown from there if you don't want to drive, because you can take TRAX - the light rail train system in SLC. 

I would also say go to Sundance if you are here for those dates. You should also go skiing if you want to do something that screams Utah. We have some of the best slopes in the world and only a 30 to 45 minute drive from downtown.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a lot of hate going on in here. I personally am excited. I don't get why people were so excited to play Colorado St. last year, yet they are furious they play BYU this year. 

I know we got screwed in this bowl game, but I think we are all just upset because we know what could have been had we won the Arizona game. If we won that game, we wouldn't even have to worry about this situation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was reading through some comments on the LA times today about gun control and some of them made me sick. 

One commenter suggested that it was the victims faults for being shot because none of them had a gun to protect themselves. He mentioned that if they had, a lot less people could have been hurt.

But why should I need to carry a gun to feel safe when I go out in public? I don't want to own a gun, and I should feel safe going out in public without a gun because I am living in 2015. 

I believe there should be greater gun control, but don't believe it is the only thing to reduce these attacks. Unfortunately, as a country, we have become desensitized to all of these attacks because they happen far too often. They have become common. 

I believe we need a greater fundamental change away to move away from accepting violence (watching movies with lots of guns, video game violence, etc.). It has to start at the state level and move nationally.  </TEXT>
