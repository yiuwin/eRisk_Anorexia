	<TEXT> There are basically two ways you can do it. You can fist stew the joint for about 1 hour an half (depending on size), then roast it to get the skin crisp, or roast it for 5-6 hours at 120C and then about half hour at 220C to crisp the skin. The latter is my favourite. "Shower" the joint with dark beer, then rub it with a mix of salt, caraway seed and pepper. Put some garlic, onion and herbs in the roasting pan. Baste it every now and again with the spiced beer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  is one of the oldest food safety laws

That's a misconception, actually. The purpose of the law was, on the one hand to streamline tax collection (as was the case in England) and, on the other, to reserve the use of rye and wheat for breadmaking.

People back in 1516 knew that there was yeast in the beer. They didn't understand the nature of it. There are mentions of yeasts in documents dating from the 14 or 15 century. The thing is that they did not consider it as ingredient of beer, as they produced it in a very similar fashion to sourdough. In fact, Czech brewing legislation still does not see yeast as ingredient in beer. A brewer friend of mine once received a warning by a food safety inspector for listing yeast among the ingredients in the labels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny because Bill Cosby is facing prosecution for sexual assault he allegedly committed more than a decade ago. Not to mention that he can be sued (and probably is being sued) in a Civil Court. So, once again, my point is not moot. And once again, different codes apply, and copyright infringement is still being committed if the perpetrator/accused is benefiting from it at the expense of the intellectual property owner. To draw a very crass analogy, it is as if you had been suffering sexual abused for more than a decade.

You didn't say that at the beginning

Other than that, I have no problem drinking from any kind of glass, as long as it is clean (preferably chilled and wet with cold water) as I don't believe the shape of the glass has any significant effect on the flavour of the beer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot for that answer! It's pretty much what I had imagined after reading bits and pieces of the topic in Czech, it's really good to have in more detail

I was interested about the possible ethnic tensions because I figured that the loyalists to the former regime would have a lot of Germans in their ranks. It seems to be a bit of history that most Czechs, understandably, prefer not to talk about too much. The picture you get here is that Prvn Republika was almost a jolly time for everyone, which is not quite true.

PS: The story of the Czech Legion deserves a film, really. It's quite impressive </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, in fact, even beers from less than 200 years ago will likely taste very different to modern beers. 

Thermometers, hydrometers, single yeast cultures produced in labs, basic principles of hygiene and sanitation, automatic temperature controls, etc., things that even home brewers today take for granted, were not available to the average commercial brewery, in some cases like single yeast culture, until late 19th, early 20th century. 

The use of thermometers and hydrometers, for example, didn't become standard until mid 19th century. When Czech brewer Frantiek Ondej Poup proposed hygiene and sanitation at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries as practices that could improve the quality of beer, he wasn't taken seriously at first. 

To this we should add that barley cultivars are different than they were centuries ago, and that malting has also evolved. The same could be said about hops and their processing. And we aren't even speaking about filtering and pasteurisation here. 

The closest thing you could find today to what beer might have tasted like a few centuries ago are the Raw Ales that are still being brewed by some people in Scandinavia and the farmhouse ales in the Baltic Countries. In many cases, they are still using old technology and processes, and even heirloom yeast cultures. [This blog](http://www.garshol.priv.no/blog/) speaks almost exclusively about them, and with a lot of solid research. (This might also answer the question of the oldest recipe still being brewed).

For something more "modern", Ron Pattinson is perhaps the best source. [His blog](http://barclayperkins.blogspot.cz/) is full of tables and transcriptions from primary sources (brewing logs, etc.), and he has helped several renowned breweries to recreate old recipes based on archives and logs. I think he has even managed to get someone to grow a strain of barley that nobody had grown for ages, and use it to make brown malt with the practices of the 18th century, or at least it was one of the projects. I recommend his book The Home Brewer's Guide to Vintage Beer with recipes of famous beers from the 19th and 20th. It's a fantastic way to see how beer styles have evolved in time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Midas Touch, like the rest of the Ancient Ales series, might be a very good beer, but whether it is in anyway similar to the recipe they claim to recreate is very much open to debate. What those findings have provided is not much more than a list of ingredients that we assume were used all at the same time to make beer. But we know nothing about all the rest, which is more important: what were the proportions of the ingredients, how they were mixed and processed, at what temperatures and for how long were they "cooked", what were the conditions of fermentation (temperature, length), etc.  </TEXT>

Given the massive tax breaks and incentives this abomination has received, it wouldn't be surprising to find out the place was "designed to fail". I would love to see what relationships the construction companies that built it had with the owners of the Ark Encounter. </TEXT>

Save a very few notable exceptions, I find them boring, awfully onanistic, often poorly written by people whose sole purpose seems to be how many flavour or aroma notes they can find in a given beer, devoid of context and with hardly any useful information (and don't get me started with the video reviews).  </TEXT>

When I go to the pub, I usually have a couple of pints and call it a day, so I can be back home early and in good condition. I simply can't imagine going there and have a soda or a cup of coffee, it'd feel like breaking the ritual, or something. So, I just don't go. It makes it a lot easier.  </TEXT>

A guy went to rob a bank claiming to have a bomb in a bag. The teller told him he was not authorised to give him the cash, that he (the robber), should ask the Treasurer, who said he wasn't authorised, and told the robber to go ask the manager.

The robber went and a clerk that he should wait a little because the manager was with another client, or on the phone; and if he could just step aside so another client could be served. 

The robber left, and was caught by the police, that had been alerted by another client. </TEXT>

I'm not an experienced rider. I was on a trip with friends and we rented some horses. The one I got was young and full of energy, just like my mate's. For one of those stupid reasons you can't explain better than with "we were young and stupid", we though it'd be cool to have a short race. 

My horse was galloping pretty fast, and I was way ahead when I feel the saddle loosening and sliding to one side. I was wearing a leather jacket and I simply jumped off the horse, hoping to land on my upper arm and shoulder. I managed that, then I rolled a couple of times and I stopped standing on my feet as if it had all been planned. Part of me felt like a fucking superhero, part felt like shitting my pants. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe "objective" is not the right word. What I mean is that when you buy a product with a PGI label, you know you are getting something made in a specific place, in a specific way, regardless of who owns the company that makes it. Basically, you are guaranteed a minimum quality standard (whether you will like the product or not, that's another thing). Those standards are not so easily changed. Not only they have to be approved by the members of the relevant trade association, but also by the authorities that granted them the PGI. (And mind you, PGIs are also there to protect companies).

The way you have it now with the BA is that pretty much from one day to another "small brewery" went from 2 million barrels a year to 6, and brewing with corn became Kosher. Tomorrow, who knows, they could agree to raise the 25% limit for independent brewery to 30 or 35%, and you still would not really know what kind of product you are getting when you buy a new "Craft Beer".

if consumers don't like the current craft brewery criteria then it should change/disappear.

I think most consumers don't give a toss one way or another, for better or worse. They want to have a beer they'll enjoy, all the rest, for them, is not much more than stories and marketing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> PGIs like Champagne, or Klsch, for that matter, is based on more objective criteria: where the product comes from and how it is made. So, a small, independent Champagne maker could be acquired by Macro-Wine and the product will not loose the indication, as long as the new owners did not deviate from the standards set by the PGI. 

Compare this to Lagunitas. They stopped being "Craft Beer" the moment they sold 50% of their shares to Heineken, without anything having changed in the product. At the same time, Stone can open a second location in the US and one in Europe and they could technically alter the recipe, the sourcing of the ingredients or the production process of one, or all, of their beers and they would still be "Craft Beer", under the BA's definition. 

Maybe someone should have registered "Craft Beer" as a brand in a manner similar to "Trappist Beer", and they would have been able to set whatever rule they fancied to get the seal of approval. They didn't, and "Craft Beer" is now a brand in the public domain that means whatever sellers and buyers want it to mean.  </TEXT>

When that brewery was acquired by Pilsner Urquell, they introduced the bags, and they've been the ones that've been marketing them most aggressively. It's a win-win for pubs and breweries. They hold 5 or 10 hl, and are delivered in little tanker lorries. Lower transportation costs, less work for the pub's staff and no empty kegs taking over cellar space, and no deposit on them, either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Est provocando daos. Las clases de ingls ya fueron pagadas y si el empleado estuvo ausente es guita que se perdi. En algunas empresas en donde di clases, era peor. Al fin del curso les tenamos que tomar un examen y si no sacaban al menos 70% tenan que pagar todo el curso, o al menos la mitad. 

Desde el punto de vista de la empresa, me parece bien. De otro modo, y te lo digo por experiencia, las clases de ingls terminan en que el profe va a charlar de cualquier pelotudez o el alumno no toma las clases porque tiene otra cosa que hacer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Hora 17.59, me levanto de mi puesto y digo "hasta maana muchachos...", mi jefe me mira y me dice "cinco y cincuenta y nueve, no son las seis...", lo mire con cara de orto y sin decir nada me fui a la mierda.

Trabaj una vez en una empresa japonesa. Un da de haberme estado rascando el culo a cuatro manos, no tena ganas de hacer horas extras y quera irme a casa temprano (es decir, en horario). Apago la PC, saludo a mi jefe, que de golpe se levanta, agarra un papel del escritorio y me dice que era urgente. Lo miro y le digo que el papel haba estado todo el da en su escritorio y si haba podido esperar hasta las 5, poda esperar hasta el da siguiente. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hace 20 aos de esto. 

Empec a laburar en una consultora de marketing, en la parte de "tipeo", creo que se llamba. Bsicamente, lo que tenamos que hacer era poner todo lo que producan los que estaban a cargo de los estudios y presentaciones en computadora. Usbamos Word, Excel, Power Point y Corel Draw. El sueldo no estaba nada mal y pagaban horas extras sin pijotearte ni un minuto. Hasta ah todo bien. 

El problema era que todo te lo mandaban a ltimo momento, en especial uno de los dueos de la consultora. Por ej. el tipo a las 5 y media faxeaba desde el "kantry" una pequea novela escrita a mano, que tena que estar tipeada e impresa, sin ningn error (no poda faltar ni una coma), a primera hora de la maana siguiente. En serio, un da nos quedamos hasta las cuatro de la maana terminando uno de esos mamotretos. 

Un da dividieron al equipo en dos (muy a regaadientes la jefa, porque quera seguir cobrando todas las horas extras) con un grupo laburando de 8 a 17 y el otro de 15 a 24. Yo estaba en el segundo. Los das que no haba mucho laburo estaba fenmeno porque para las 7 ya se haban rajado todos y nos rascbamos las pelotas hasta tener que irnos (no nos podamos ir ms temprano por las dudas que alguno de los dueos llame o mande algo), pero cuando haba algo que hacer, nos tenamos que quedar hasta terminarlo. Un da nos quedamos hasta las 6. 

Como si esto no fuese poco, la forra de la jefa era de llamar a los del turno tarde a la maana con alguna pregunta pelotuda que poda esperar hasta que lleguemos. Tanto me rompi las pelotas que si estaba solo ya no atenda el telfono y mi vieja tena rdenes de decir que yo no estaba en casa. A la mina eso mucho no le gustaba, pero tampoco era mucho lo que poda hacer. Cuando llegaba a las 3 y me preguntaba dnde haba estado, le deca que eran cosas mas. 

Otra cosa que hacan era "pedirte" que vayas a laburar el fin de semana. Un domingo a la maana, la yegua esta me llama dicindome que tena que ir a la oficina porque el dueo haba mandado algo que tena que estar listo para el lunes a la maana. Le dije que no poda porque ya tena planes (era verdad, un asado). La pajera empez a insistir de mala manera y creo que le cort, o algo por el estilo. 

El lunes la mina no dijo nada, solamente me mir con cara de orto, que era su estado comn--desayunaba con vinagre, parece. Un par de das ms tarde, cuando el contrato de prueba por tres meses estaba por terminar, vengo a laburar y Ms Caradechota (que me haba estado llamando toda la maana) me empieza a cagar a puteadas, mal, porque, segn ella, me haba mandado un moco groso con una presentacin en Power Point, en la que haba trabajado apenas un rato. Al da de hoy sigo convencido de que la macana no me la mand yo, porque tan boludo no podra ser, aunque, por otro lado, el cansancio te hace hacer pelotudces que de otro modo no haras. 

De ms est decir, no renovaron el contrato como efectivo y la verdad es que mucho no me enoj.

But wait, there is more! 

Uno o dos meses ms tarde, a la noche, el consolador humano ese me llama diciendo que necesitaba ayuda urgente para poder terminar una presentacin, y si por favor no le haca la gauchada. Ganas de mandarla a la concha de su ta no faltaban, pero prefer decirle "no" y cortarle.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Submission statement:** It is widely believed that crowds are wiser than individuals. The problem with this, however, is not only that some people know more than others, but that crowds themselves can be biased. Metaknowledge could be a tool to minimise the effect of that bias, and to make better predictions based on the wisdom of the crowds. </TEXT>
