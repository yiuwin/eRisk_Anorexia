	<TEXT> Actually I searched this entire thread, and this is the first post I found that somebody said anything bad about Sikhs. 

Like the entire thread, is just praising "awesome culture". I refuse to believe there is a culture or religion of people that is entirely made of angels and teddy bears.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I joined up a local kick-boxing club as I wanted to have some healthy exercise and good stress relief. I was not disappointed at all, it really made feel really good mentally and in my body.

BUT...

I got a cold for the second time, and its really annoying and tiresome, and I'm really worried will it break my regime. I'm just the type that cannot miss a workout/training session, it always feels like a huge setback and a downward slope to me. 

Now I did research a little bit about this, and one of my suspicions may be confirmed. Apparently, if you start doing intense workouts, you weaken your immune system, which makes you more susceptible to a cold virus, also you know gyms are festering with viruses. 

Now a lot of people seems to advice to NOT STOP, to soldier through this and it will eventually stop. But what do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In all my years of existence on earth I don't think there are many human beings that can be called as pathetic as people that are "loyal" to giant corporations and brands. They showcase some of the worst in humanity, the vile narrow minded tribalism at its rawest. 

Just think about it, even millenniums of civilization couldn't fixed it. We as a matter of fact, have people that are "loyal" to Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia or whatever... Because those poor, poor companies, what are they gonna do without their trusty buddies valorously defending them on the internetz! Seriously though, I have no idea how to deal with these people, if they do not understand how capitalism works or cost/performance, what is there to talk about them? If they cannot grasp the simple concept of "What is best for me right now?" but use "This company with the green logo is ALWAYS BEST FOR ME". 

What is there left to say after that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh so they amped up the stupid in the plot? I really wish there was some way of quality control for Tolkien adaptations. 

Well, I hope the gameplay will be more than Arkham/AC bore with one gimmick. The previous game looked so dreadfully dull and inspired, all it had was one game mechanic that doesn't look that amazing on its own.

I also can't go without mentioning this. The African looking Gondor soldier, yeah political correctness and diversity quotas have to slime their way even into everything, even Tolkien fantasy.

Before you accuse me with buzzwords, I would be the first in line to throw money away if some respectable developer made an action/rpg set in a fantasy universe that is inspired by some of the many African folklore cultures, with ONLY black people. That is the way how you do it, and not this half-assed shit were you just score pathetic tokens and ruin an established look.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the fact that something happens in the show well make me more inclined to believe its a spoiler, because honestly I have no firm idea about ASOIAF ending. Of course I would hope its just something they are pulling something out of their ass. 

With the risk of sounding like an elitist prick, I think we cannot apply conventional hero-story logic to ASOIAF, part of the appeal is that I do not know what will happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very good post. Well it seems to me that even today, most of Brits and Americans barely know anything about their countries, laws etc. Which is fine and normal. Most of them care about their daily occurrences and not some abstract laws of liberty. But okay maybe I am throwing around words there. 

However you mention that they were loyal to their place of birth, of course that makes sense. But what made them unite with the other colonies so strongly and risk their lives for? 

I guess I am confused, cause I got used to "division" being such a strong factor in history and costing many countries and peoples, and then suddenly these "Americans" show up and are united out of seemingly nowhere.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way this war is depicted by various kinds of media (not just movies) Americans are portrayed as fiercely, and I mean fiercely loyal, patriotic and motivated. That always confused me, because it just doesn't any sense to me. Now since as I mentioned most of my contact with this period of history is American media which was really rough and simpleton, my post is a bit "rough" too...

So the way I see it the soldiers and people of the colonies are fighting for a non-existing nation that isn't based on any previous tradition or historical legacy but on some fancy writings by some upper class intellectuals. You just can't convince me that the common American cared about the crap Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin cared. The rich ones certainly didn't because slavery was a thing for the next 100 years. In fact modern every day Joes probably don't care about it (except muh guns). Then these American soldiers went  against what was until recently their fellow countrymen (I understand that there was a lot of loyalist fighting for the British), on a land that wasn't theirs that long to even begin with... 

Then there are individual states among the colonies, who also have "arbitrary" divisions on paper, I say that because would anyone really care if somebody changed a state's name or its borders? We're not talking about some European nation with cultural, religious and historical heritage. What difference would it make for the ordinary Joe except some materialistic ones? 

I also don't thing the British treated the colonials like Nazis treated the Jews or anything even close to that. In fact, I do not understand why was there even a division between the colonials and the British, why weren't they both "British"? What I also have the impression is that British imposed some taxes that they didn't even collect except the tea, and that there was a Boston "massacre" were the immense amount of 5 people died... 

Whenever I combine these reasons it remains perplexing to me that the masses would go to war for them and even be really proud about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I gave up on the show around season 5, I just didn't feel Martin there and turns out that Martin and GoT are going separate ways. But I am wondering, as we are constantly bombarded by thumbnails, clickbait and other internet media, how much should we even be afraid of the GoT spoilers, are they relevant to the books.

I apologize cause I won't be able to remember where I stumbled upon that info, but I heard/read once that GoT took a strong independent course and that its gonna be radically different from Martin's future books. Even the endings.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-25 21:56:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From what I understand Witcher 3 is basically light years away from DO:I, in the sense that there are no grind side quests, there are no loading times (except voluntary fast travel and visiting two large areas), character facial animations look horrible in DA:I, DA:I has a weak story overall and DA:I's open world seems like a typical bland MMO wasteland though maybe I am wrong about that.

Now I am partially willing to go over the weak story, since Bioware always fucks those up anyway, but the characters have to be fleshed out so I hope they get that right, I am even willing to look past their political preaching.

Also W3 had horrible disappointing villains, so Bioware's horrible villains can't be THAT bad.

But its the sidequests (gathering blankets and firewood, really???) and the open world that worry me the most, I really don't know how will I be able to handle that, to me Witcher 3 basically signaled a strong message of "NO MORE BLAND OPEN WORLD GAMES" , and now I am wondering is DO:I worth the grind.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, I loved DA:O, didn't even bother with DA2. Mostly liked the ME franchise. 


EDIT2: A Forbes writer Paul Tassi once called DA:I "The Crash(2004) of Game of the Years". He referred to the horrible movie Crash that won an Academy Award just because it was the least shitty. Seems that Paul Tassi was on spot.

EDIT3: Only now I remembered another infamous problem about this game, and that's its camera. I remember a year a go, the game was free for a few days and I tested it out. It was frustrating to say the least, even more so considering Origins had a perfectly functional camera. </TEXT>
