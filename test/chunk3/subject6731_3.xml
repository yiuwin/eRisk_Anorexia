	<TEXT> No it is not. That is ridiculous. DALT is much closer to DMT. DPT is more intense than MPT but, other than that, they are very similar qualitatively. MPT is nothing like DMT. Nothing whatsoever. I say that not just from my experience but from having witnessed no less than eight other people use it.

DALT, if done correctly, is amazingly potent and immersive. But the problem is that almost nobody knows how properly to do it, so they get nothing. DALT is an extremely finicky mistress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It felt like a totally different drug, frankly. The taste and vibrations were the same, but the trip was totally different. 

There is always nausea with DPT, as far as I know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't done DALT, but I've seen people do it. Too intense for the fan of DPT, but he's never done DMT. Lasted about 15 minutes. Smoked with a freebase glass pipe and a torch lighter, which are essentials if you want to get any effects. Described it pretty much as others would describe DMT. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could just order some baicalin or baicalein online ;)

In which case I'd recommend about 3g for the former and 500mg for the latter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually took a low dose of 4-HO-MET for an horrible headache before and it worked wonderfully. Most highly recommended! </TEXT>
