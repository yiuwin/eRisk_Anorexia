	<TEXT> Q and A can get fucked frankly.
My brother got asked to do a question for when turnbull was on as comms minister. 
Would not let him ask an NBN question?.
He is the comms minister in charge of nbn yet can't ask a NBN related question.

Apparently they screen the questions so they don't have gotcha moment's.
They should let them ask whatever they want pursuant to that nights panel that way they can not be prepare with party speaking points.

And frankly im sick of every time the panel  is dealing with indigenous issues  how it turns into a SJW attack   and  this is not me being racist.
"Black men have it hard,The white man put's them in prison all the time. society doesn't know what it's like to be aboriginal"  the way they speak it's like they think that cops just go around rounding up young aboriginal ppl to lock them up.
No they did a crime and the courts found you guilty,pisses me off to no end and then the episode tries to turn into a white guilt parade.
You as much as you hate it are part of a society. you don't follow those rules  your going to get nicked.
Not to mention it lets idiots like that lady who thinks islam is a religion of feminists? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah not really.

China has the capability to pretty much force it's population to follow edicts from on high.
The us can't do this.

I mean the chinese govt can and has told ppl they won't be able to use the banks   for several weeks in 2008
Nothing happend,ppl be like that sucks ok.

If the US did that ppl would be rioting and burning shit down like a riot in ferguson.

The us has 20 trillion in debt.
Even if it cut defence spending heavily it would not be able to outstrip the inflation on that debt.
And eventual the value of goods in the us will outweigh it's value as

And if shit goes sour china can outspend anyone right now.

It has 3.4 TRILLION with  T in foreign reserves in it's central bank and an estimated 900 billion in it's own currency as well.
yeah it's not all rosy as they have a 1.8 percent trade deficit in china right now.
But that's a first in 4 years. so if it happens again next quarter then we might be talking.


China has a reasonable  central approval rating as well for  civil improvement's.

i mean the city of wenzou   had a water issue like flint Michigan were lead was detected in the pipes.
What did the govt do?.

sent 12,000   Troops from the enginger corps  as well as deployed 6000 ppl from the largest state owned construction firm.CSCA   and  took em less than 2 months to pretty much do 80 percent of all the effected pipes.
cause it was a damaging thing to have and made china look bad.
the us just simply can't match this level of civil works. and that's why it can never beat china unless it's economy implodes

But let's all pile on the anti china circlejerk

	<TEXT> The US is Dead.
We might as well start partnering up with India/indonesia/china.
All those countrys are educating and bringing up the lower classes into mid class society.
That's a lot of new money coming into play.
We have a great services economy that can help ppl transition into that lifestyle.

We need to get over the illusion that america is the big dad.
China  can play a massive waiting game over the US and will come out the victor.
Us has 20.1 trillion in debt and growing this can't go on forever.

India if it get's it's aim and systems in check will be the gold mine in the next 20 years.
350 million estimated ppl will be entering the middle class bracket in india in the next 15 years.
All those ppl want to buy shit,need services,education.

i mean look at Cellphones in India. some of the chinese firms have been outselling all the other makers alone just by targeting the indian market (xiaomi)

Indonesia is the next person we need to repair ties with.
We literaly have a 240 million person market less than 1200km from us.
Yet we constantly put out foot in our urethra in regards to them
in 20 years they could very well be  in top 10.
They went from 23 to 16 in under 11 years.

Also has like 1200 acres of land near penrith that it could get a hefty  price for.
Im not  sure if they still do but the anglican church has a 2.5 percent stake in westfields as well.
yes,I agree that the churches should be exempt for charitable endeavours.
But it should be like any other company.

Im talking about someone coming up with i dunno let say.
a new interface that bypasses needing to use PCIe lanes thus not impacting multi gpu setups.
and being able to get like 20Gbps or something.

yeah im all for massive drives,andcompanys finding new ways to  cram 10tb onto a drive.
but id much rather see lower latency and  randam acess speeds or something.

I just find it odd.

It's not the box.
it's ur ISP being a cheap cunt and limiting the CVC  bandwidth every night so that they can turn a profit next month

it would be so simple to fix.
All NBNco would have to do is get the  comms minister to wave  trust issues in parliament.
let them lower the CVC price to say 7-9 dollars per Mbit
problem solved
You still make a profit  but it will just take slighlty longer.

This whole disaster can be blamed on telstra.
Those greedy fucks wanted a second payment,and they conviced the govt to change from 12 POIs to 121 knowing full well that would make it harder for small players to enter </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay.
A FTTN node.
Has a port card in it
for 128 homes.

It has a 2Gbit uplink right now.
all the new ones sine december are 10gb.
But lets use the 2gbit ones.

thats 15Mbit per a person.
But you are assuming every home will have a connection they wont.

neither of my neighbors have net  nor do a lot of ppl around me and most likely around you.

So there will always be excess capacity at the actual node point. 
No Node in Australia is full currently that he is aware of   when i asked a mate at NBN.

Uploads are neglible on the system as come 6pm most ppl are pulling down.
So we don't need to worry about that.

But as i said before.
90 percent of ppl will be facebooking or browsing. which all uses a quick speed to load the page data  and then it's very light  use after that just to refresh data headers.

Same for Youtube  as it uses a G.2 Propierary algorithm  youtube videos are very very small now.
You can get a 1080p video with 3 mins length for less than 30MB on youtube now.

Same for netflix.
used to be an hour video was about 2GB.
Now with VP9 And HEVC(Yes it supports HEVC as of FEB for some devices) it's half that.

Ill go off the Node located  2FOE-22 (Forster-Tuncurry 22)
Service Area	2FOE (Forster-Tuncurry )
Connectivity Service Area	CSA200000000549
Connected Active  107.
18:27PM  3/22/2017   56.17 Percent.

So right now the most populated node in australia  is even now at peak time using only 56.17 percent of it's capacity. and it's almost filled its quota
As i said there is no such thing as node congestion.

Now when everyone starts rocking 4k TVs and shit then we can start talking about it.

Yes FTTN is shit.
But blame NBNco not the little green box.
If we had  of had labors plan right now we would be paying 8.20 Per a Mbit in CVC prices as of may 2017.

We currently pay 15. that is the problem </TEXT>

Im going to go to uni and study   the history of art in the renaissance period. 3 years later..
OMG DAE WHY WONT COMMBANK HIRE ME I HAVE A UNI DEGREE..
Systems rigged. Im not voting for this MP.

Dude  why the fuck would commbank or anyone for that matter want  to hire someone who studied art.



Major problem is  unis are  charging and providing courses that they know,The market does not require.
So we end up with a saturation of uni grads looking for work with no work experience or required skills

Perhaps we should start to look at what some of the EU members are doing.

You want to be a doctor,Nurse,teacher,policeman,Engineer,biologist,agriculture,economics  so on.
 Fine here you go we are happy to pay ur hecs for you as you will contribute to society.

But you want to study roman history or accounting fuck off,why should the taxpayer foot the bill if the use to society return wont be seen by people.

I mean we had what  1100 accountants grad in 2015. Like fuck we need that many lol,not when the job will be automated soon

Tafes only a shambles as we let the liberal govts fuck it with a std infested cock.

	<TEXT> 128users.
On every port of the Card.
Yeah no.
Not even 20 percent of the user base would be using anything more than 10mbit at any one time.

The only way to do that is if every house that's there. and that will never EVER be the case some ppl just don't buy internet,you wont find every port full.

is if everyone hits up netflix at 6pm and all watch tv.
This doesnt happen.

but with more demanding services we will reach a point of   needing to upgrade the shitty FTTN points to 10Gbit or 20Gbit cards

As much as Bill Morrow is a fucking cunt that needs to have his throat stuffed with a toddlers leg.
he is correct in the  statement that FTTN nodes don't suffer congestion.
But he can get fucked for not lowering the  CVC costs.
NBN and ACCC can both get fucked.

	<TEXT> Myrepublics fine now.

But basic maths will show you it just can't last.

It cost.
for you to get a connection with NBNco 51.50 cent's. for 100mbit.
You then have to pay CVC costs as well.. which is 15.20 per Mbit.
So uhh yeah?
even with  only a few hundred users your still going to have to spread that out so much that it's going to have to start slowing down

So we are expected to believe that they can provide 100mbit to majority of users. with no slowdown on service.

If the big players like tpg  and optus are having trouble making ends meet when they are charging 80 bucks how the fuck can you think someone at 59 is.
Somewhere down the line  they will start oversubscribing users and it's game over come 6pm

	<TEXT> I did a massive post on which ISP in australia are currently the best for peak hour speeds on the nbn  with good CVC policys.
to rehash


Aussie Broadband(Call early in the day to order ur service as they get really lazy after lunch as i think they go to the pub).

Currently has 35Mbit of CVC left over  most days.

AusBBs.
Shit pricing.
But they  have a very good CVC policy and they don't offer unlimited which helps keep the  power users away.

Tangerine Rather new comer but they have a  pretty decent customer satisfaction.

Leaptel has   a 90 percent speed guarantee that you will get 90 percent of the speed ur line can handle or you get a refund. they have yet to break this promise,service is very very good as well.
Currently has 95Mbit left over even while they are getting hammerd



DO NOT.
TOUCH TPG.
Or MyRepublic  
Optus will fuck you raw like scott morrison   with wait times.

Telstra is a bag of fucks right now for getting a service set up.
Unless you can haggle them into giving you some extra mobile data or something steer clear  as it's overpriced piece of shit.

SkyMesh service has gone to shit but speeds stay very current


When you order with a new ISP.

Ask who the wholesaler is.
If it's  AAPT   take a walk unless the plan suits you.
since jan first AAPT has had  core restarts   or Unscheduled maintance 17 times. that's just horrid.

If the ISP offers it get a 50Mbit plan. if you can max it out then next month just upgrade it. that way ur not paying 20 bucks or more extra when you line might only be 30mbit </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please ppl..
Can we kill the node congestion idea.

Unless everyone on the the node is hammering away at a minimum of 15.6 Mbps  100 percent of the time it's Literally not possible to congest the node.
The problem is ISPs  that are cheap cunt's not purchasing enough CVC aggregate capacity.
yes FTTN is a shit.
SHIT SHIT SHIT technolgy but it's rarely not to blame,it will be either the line to ur house is shit. or ur ISP is being a pikey and stinging on the CVC


To congest a node  with its 128ports everyone would have to be doing 15mbit 100 percent of the time.
And they won't be doing that. as  most ppl are just on youtube or a HTML page witch is burst speeds.
