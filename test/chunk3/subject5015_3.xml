	<TEXT> So I started with a new client, and we met up at the local Planet Fitness. Well, my client starts by showing me the machines he uses there. 

Which is almost all just machines and limited free weights, but that's another rant for another day.

Anyway, we get to this one machine for doing lat pull downs and my new client proceeds to tell me how a Planet Fitness "trainer" told him, "To get that good burn you need to sit backwards in the machine.  Opposite of what the instructions show." Mind you my client is only 17 and a total newbie to fitness. 

It just amazes me how wrong and harmful the information that these "trainers" at these places give out to people that don't know any better.

But I guess that is what you get when you pay your trainers $10 bucks an hour.  </TEXT>
