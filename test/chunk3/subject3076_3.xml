	<TEXT> Morning drinking and hiding it should have been red flags for me to ask for help. I didn't. My substance abuse problem got a lot worse.

Everyone here has a different pattern. I believe what makes me qualify to be a substance abuser is the mental relationship I have with alcohol, and the things I did around it to hide and continue my use, despite consequences. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The anticipation is actually part of the reward system programmed by dopamine. It's an insanely attractive part of using. Drug seeking behaviour is rooted in very strong biological drives. 

I realized that to break this I needed to act and behave differently. 

This meant changing my patterns. Quite honestly I didn't drive past my old haunts, I didn't go near bars or liquor stores. ObviousLy I couldn't avoid it all, but that doesn't mean it's a losing battle.

The serenity prayer tells me to change what I can. I did.

I also started to engage in mindfulness and used a program of recovery to help have new ways of feeling excitement. 

The drive to my one year AA anniversary was almost as intoxicating as driving to the beer store. 

Life became exciting again when I grabbed what I could by the balls and let go of the rest. </TEXT>

In the meantime I went to my GP and talked. About options, about referralls and to get some bloodwork done to see if I needed anh medical help. 

The pain and anxiety lessened when I started doing. I was good at sitting around and feeling sorry for myself. That never helped me stay sober. </TEXT>

I personally approach situations like this in a curious and supportive fashion. 

"Dad you haven't been yourself lately"

 Or

"You know Dad I love you and I am concerned that you've strayed from sobriety. I know it meant a lot to you and it meant a lot to me too. Can you help me understand?"

 I leave out judgements and stay away from giving what I think should happen next.

	<TEXT> I've seen people dying of alcoholism. It is not a "live fast die young" hip thing. It's an extremely painful and slow death.

I made a decision when I first got sober to make an impact. If that's on my children, my family, anything.

What matters is the quality of my life today and the type of life I am setting myself up for in 20 years. I don't want to be 50 years old, dying of alcoholism and smoking all day. 

I'm not sure why you are putting yourself through the anguish of sobriety, but I see the bottle talking you into drinking pretty well right now. What are you going to do? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before I got into recovery I was terrified that all of my life problems and trauma would hit me all at once. It didn't. I dealt with it slowly, as things came up. I couldn't get sober because I "couldn't deal with X, Y, and Z"

I also started believing I didn't really deserve to recover, or that it wasn't possible, because I was so fucked up.

Worry is my go to. It's my safety blanket. But it isn't working anymore, so I had to let it go. Slowly, over time.

I hope you find what you need on SD. </TEXT>

Our number count is sometimes exponential on this sub, and at other times, it's a quiet trickle of new people everyday.

Whoever you are, thank you.

And we mean that.

Thank your brothers and sisters in this journey. When we talk about our drinking problem, we start to release the self-stigma. 

And when we release ourselves from self-shame and guilt, we create ripples.

People around us notice. People want to be around us...and some people will leave us. Sometimes people change, sometimes they don't. Whatever happens, our energy, strength, and courage radiates. 

When we echo each other, support, comfort, encourage and are accepting of **others**: we give **ourselves** permission to change, grow and become another version of ourselves. One connected to our values and beliefs.

So thank you, for echoing each other and creating ripples.

50,000 ripples. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-09-03 19:56:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Acceptance is a word that gets thrown around a lot in recovery. We have to accept that something is happening before we can change it, we have to accept that life will throw curveballs, we have to accept this and that and this and that.

At the same time, enforcing boundaries, having values and beliefs, might seem at odds with acceptance. Should I accept abuse in my life? Should I practice acceptance if I relapse?

Acceptance, in my view, is a form of self and other compassion. I can practice compassion and acceptance, but also have values and boundaries: because ultimately, that means I respect and honour myself.

**This week's prompt:** **Let's write about what acceptance is in YOUR recovery. What have you accepted? How do you see acceptance working in your life?** </TEXT>

What this quote means to me: my opinions reflect my beliefs, and my beliefs reflect my core values. What I say, what I do, how I act, how I treat others: is a reflection of my character (my beliefs and values)

When I see the world as a hateful and uncaring place...what does that say about my character? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *Ritual: a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence*

Rituals are almost innate part of the human experience. I had many rituals in active addiction, and now I have some new ones in recovery. Starting new rituals is awkward and weird: but it sooner or later starts to feel soothing for me.

Wikipedia says that rituals include the following:

- rites of passage

- atonement and purification rites

- oaths of allegiance

- dedication ceremonies

- coronations and presidential inaugurations

- marriages and funerals

- school "rush" traditions and graduations

- club meetings

- sporting events

- Halloween parties

- veterans parades

- Christmas shopping 

**This week's prompt:** **Write about a ritual (or rituals) that you have in your life that are meaningful or memorable. It can be from the past or present. What do you like about it? How do you feel before/during/after? How did this ritual become part of your life?** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The ocean of suffering is immense, but if you turn around, you can see the land.**

- Thich Nhat Hanh

*What this quote means to me is that perception is everything. I often read about people trying to change their entire lives in order to stop drinking, and then about those who are filled with fear on changing anything. Sometimes, all it takes, is a turning of the mind...a new perspective...a very small change...*

Shame is a little different from guilt. Guilt is: I DID a bad thing.

Shame is more intensely: I AM bad, I have no inherent worth.

This is a tough topic for many people in recovery or looking for recovery. Please be mindful of retraumatizing yourself reading and writing through this week's prompt. I am not my shame.

**This week's prompt** **Shame: where do you feel it? How does it effect you? What small steps have you made to counter that voice?**

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So this weekend writing is a little different. This is a fun, pretend, not clinical, "psychological" test.

This one is usually done in a group and it's as confidential as you want it to be. You only share if you're comfortable.

So that's the same here.

What I am recommending is that you write your answers out first on a sheet of paper, go through the exercise, and then decide what parts you want to post.

**Here we go!**

**Getting to know me by Larry Dodge**

 Question #1. If you died and could come back as any animal you wanted, what would that
animal be? When you have decided what animal you would like to be, write down 3
adjectives describing that animal.

 Question #2 What is your favorite color? Now write 3 adjectives describing that color.

 Question #3. What is your favorite river? (You don't have to have ever been there) Now
write 3 adjectives that describe that river.

 Question #4. Close your eyes and try to imagine being in the situation I will describe. You
are surrounded by a brilliant whiteness. Everywhere you turn, all you see is whiteness.
Think about being in this situation for a few seconds. Now open your eyes and write 3
adjectives that describe your feelings when you thought about being in that situation.

**Now that you've done this, the explanations are listed below as spoilers. Hover over each one to read it**

[ Question #1](#s "The 3 adjectives you wrote are how you perceive yourself. We usually want to come back as an animal with characteristics we admire.")

[ Question #2](#s "The 3 adjectives are how other people perceive you.")

[ Question #3](#s "The 3 adjectives are how you perceive sex. (or making love). Freudian stuff, amirite")

[ Question #4](#s "The 3 adjectives are how you perceive death.")

**Share whatever you feel comfortable sharing, or just write how this made you feel, if you learned anything from it, were surprised by anything, or if some of them made you laugh** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was reading an excerpt from a book I really want to read (Tribe by Sebastian Junger) and a part of it really hit home for me...why are recovery tribes/societies/movements/friendships so "unusual" in how they approach people (most of the time)?

*From the book*

*Robert Frost famously wrote that home is the place where, when you go there, they have to take you in. The word "tribe" is far harder to define, but a start might be the people you feel compelled to share the last of your food with...[This book is about why] hardship can turn out to be a great blessing and disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or tropical vacations.*

**Humans don't mind hardship, in fact they thrive on it: what they mind is not feeling necessary.**

**This week's prompt:** Let's write about belonging, about finding your tribe, about feeling part of.

*If you haven't found that yet, what would your tribe look like? What do you want out of a tribe? Or do you prefer being a lone wolf in this world?* </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Five Years! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-27 23:52:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm still sort of in shock.

Five years ago it was May 27th 2011. I found out that I was entering rehab on June 1st. I had been sober since the 22nd or so...only because I had a terrible Victoria Day long weekend. I blacked out for 2-3 days straight.

So on this fateful day five years ago, my family (sister, mom and dad) were gearing up for a movie night at home. I was restless. I knew it was one of my last nights to drink.

I decided to walk to the store. I remember telling my family that i was going out. They didn't try to follow me this time, just told me to be safe. 

I still went out and drank. But with a lightness. Like it was my choice. I made that choice. I drank. And the whole fucking time while I was chugging that bottle of wine (in the woods, behind my parent's house), I was crying and balling my eyes out.

**WHY IS THIS HAPPENING, WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME, I JUST WANT TO BE WATCHING A FUCKING MOVIE**

**I believe something cracked inside of me that night.**

But cracking and breaking doesn't mean anything for long term sobriety. Because if I broke down my rotten floorboards, I'd still need to build a new floor. *I still needed to rebuild my life. But I had a really good start*

My process was rehab. I admitted, for the first time, that I was an alcoholic. I became willing to do anything and everything. I went to the AA meetings, I cried, I got called out for my bullshit, I was sad, happy, everything in between.

I learned about substance abuse. I learned about what to expect. I learned about relapse.

I decided very early on, relapse wasn't for me. I was terrified of alcohol.

Five years later

- I am married to the man of my dreams

- I just applied to graduate school for counselling psychology (I hope to have a private practice one day and help people recover from substance abuse)

- I have a degree in addictions and mental health

- I volunteer in my community, at a peer support organization 

- I spent wayyy too much time on SD :)

- I am not an active AA member anymore. This surprises a lot of people. But there are thousands of recovering people out there who don't attend 12 step groups. What works for me, is not guaranteed to work for you. Everything changes. My vigilance has not. My connection with others in the recovering world has not. I remain true to the principals I learned in early recovery.

In the last year, I've grown in ways I never expected.

I thought I'd be pregnant by now. Instead, I have an infertility appointment next month. 

I thought I'd be employed by now. Instead, I had to get some schooling and relearn my second language.

I thought I'd be unhappy if I wasn't pregnant and/or employed. But I am happy. Because my happiness comes from within. It happens when I let go of expectations that OTHER things will make me happy, and just exist, in the moment right now.

Thank you SD. I honestly fucking love yall.

	<TEXT> This is a support group. Support groups are usually based off of a set of principals or beliefs. We have some on SD, but they are simply the guidelines listed in the sidebar: 

[Speak from the I. Be kind.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index)

We also believe in "All people. All pathways"

Everyone is welcome here, regardless of where you are. That being said, sometimes the community has a certain bias towards one thing or another.

Moderation is a hot topic. AA is a hot topic. Atheism brings out the best and worst in people. 
But this is not an AA forum, or a SMART forum, or a Rational Recovery forum, or a Refuge Recovery forum, or a fitness forum, or a meditation forum, or a cat video forum.

We sometimes resemble one or the other, but SD is really an amalgamation of people using certain methods.

These are issues that are close to our hearts, because we have firm beliefs in what WE need to stay sober.

I urge you to think: Is what worked for you, going to absolutely work for someone else?

If I honestly believed that everything that has worked for me so far, will work for everyone else, I would be incorrectly assuming that everyone's problem is the same, and the solution is therefore, the same.

I am me. You're you. I needed certain things. You need certain things. Maybe there is some overlap, I bet there is. Support groups are about *sharing our common humanity, our common trials and tribulations, milestones and victories* and they are based off the idea that we have a lot in common.

But we are not all the same. Even those who share a common illness, will not have exactly the same stories and pathways.

	<TEXT> I grew up in a world where work is valued. Hours spent, hours paid, overtime, being productive, staying busy.

I learned that staying busy was important. I also was never told I was allowed to relax and enjoy myself.

I married into a family of farmers. They love to work. They had to work to live.

Now, I wonder...is my self-worth tied to how much "value" I believe I have?

And yeah, it is.

But my WORTH as a human being...is that determined by my job, my friends, my beliefs?

	<DATE> 2016-05-14 15:15:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It has been a couple months since the weekend writing has started. The first one, or one of them, was on regrets we had about the past.

Today it's about the baggage people carry. Emotional baggage are those thoughts, events, feelings, worries that plague our mental environments.

It's that voice that tells me: "Hey, remember when you did this? Yeah you're a bad person. Just thought I'd pop in and tell you"

My first week in rehab, I was told to start letting go of some of my boulders that I was carrying around behind me. The image of a woman, attempting to climb a mountain, with a sack of boulders dragging her backwards, comes to mind. I started to let go of things I did, of things I said while I was drinking. And I started to feel better.

One caveat here: *Please be cautious not to re-traumatize yourself here. Some very bad things have happened to us. You deserve a safe and secure relationship to have this conversation in.*

**This week's prompt:** **What are you holding onto that you are ready to let go of today and tell someone?**



edit: this has been a very emotional post. THANK YOU for being vulnerable. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *Few things can make us feel crazier than expecting something from someone who has nothing to give.*

-Melody Beattie

In the depth of my addiction, I had nothing to give anyone. People wondered why I didn't have the insight, why I couldn't do something simple like stay sober for a doctor's appointment. At the end I had nothing left to give. I had a spark. That's what saved my life.

This quote is also meaningful for me, because it shows the sad state of mind that my family was in by the end. They were also out of ideas, exhausted, sad, and just DONE. I expected them to do all sorts of things for me. I wanted them to help me stay sober when I wanted to, but I expected them to walk away when I wanted to get drunk. I felt like they need to cater to my cravings.

Why did I pick this quote?

- In active addiction, between my exhaustion and mental state, and my parent's exhaustion and mental state...there was very little progress. We could not rely on each other to get better.

	<TEXT> Learning...why are we writing about LEARNING.

Well, recovering is about learning.

From wikipedia: "**Learning is the act of acquiring new, or modifying and reinforcing, existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences and may involve synthesizing different types of information.** The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, plants and some machines. **Progress over time tends to follow a learning curve. It does not happen all at once,** but builds upon and is shaped by previous knowledge. To that end, learning may be viewed as a process, rather than a collection of factual and procedural knowledge. Learning produces changes in the organism and the changes produced are relatively permanent."

First, I had to learn that my way of living didn't work. Then I needed to learn about recovery. What did it look like? What do most people go through? What the fuck are the "slogans"? What is PAWS? What are open meetings? Can I eat food that has alcohol in it?

I gathered information to help me learn. I tried out new things, so I could learn. 

I synthesized information from my surroundings, my environment, and my reactions to FORM new ways of behaving.

For me it was also about relearning how to engage in life, how to handle social situations, how to cook dinner, how to grocery shop, how to budget, how to do taxes! 

**This week's prompt:** **What have you learned so far? What do you hope to learn more about? How has learning been a part of your recovery?** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I spent a lot of my last months of drinking in the woods behind my parent's house.

I wasn't allowed to drink at their home. Well, I wasn't allowed to drink. I was policed quite heavily by my parents, because I was a danger to myself and others. I was violent, angry and suicidal. It was a scary time for my family.

I wasn't scared. I didn't know what was happening. I thought everyone was against me and no one knew how much pain I was in. It was a really confusing time for me. I didn't understand why people just couldn't let me do what I wanted: drink to oblivion.

Today I went for a walk with my mother. We had a conversation about the things she passed onto me. We talked about our anxiety, and our ability to become hyper-obsessed about things.

And we also talked about other things she passed onto me: my strong legs, my strong back, my ability to put on muscle, my cheekbones, my strong personality and my BIG laugh.

Five years ago my mom was chasing me around in the woods. She would follow me and watch me to make sure I didn't drown in the river.

Today, we walked side by side. She doesn't need to follow me. I don't need to follow her. We can walk, side by side.

	<TEXT> As far back as I can remember, my life was black and white.

Perfect or a failure.

Drinking nothing or drinking everything. (If I was unable to obtain enough booze, I sometimes wouldn't drink. Half-drunk Victoria was very angry and abusive).

I used to justify my outrageous behaviour by saying that I was "black and white" and had no "grey" areas. Because that was boring.

Now I have a few grey areas. I'm a bit of a perfectionist...so doing something half-assed, or being mediocre at something, has been part of my adult life.

I am learning that I am really good at a couple things, really bad at a couple things, and average/mediocre at a lot of things!

When all the noise is silenced,

the meetings adjourned,

the lists laid aside,

in the dark forest,

what still pulls on your soul?

In the silence between your heartbeats

hides a summons.

Do you hear it?

Name it, if you must,

or leave it forever nameless,

by why pretend it is not there?

- The Terma Collective

*Question of the week: What still pulls on your soul? Be it dreams, values...or maybe it's still pain, anger...*

Then, /u/coolcrosby [wrote this post and said that sobriety is his superpower](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4akazw/no_excuse_im_not_drinking/)

So...

IF you think sobriety is a superpower, what's your superhero name? What do you fight for? What do you value? Who's your enemy?

IF your sobriety is not a superpower...can you imagine/write about a superhero persona you want to become?

	<TEXT> Last weekend, some of us wrote a letter to addiction. For me, writing that letter was a powerful event for me, and I felt like it helped propel me into recovery.

*What is recovery though?*

The Mental Health Commission of Canada's definition is:

*Recovery is a process in which people living with mental health problems and illnesses are actively
engaged in their own journey of wellbeing. Recovery journeys build on individual, family, cultural, and
community strengths and can be supported by many types of services, supports, and treatments. The
goal is to enable people to exercise all their rights as citizens and to enjoy a meaningful life in their
community while striving to achieve their full potential. Recovery principles  including hope, self
determination and responsibility  can be adapted to the realities of different life stages, and to the full
range of mental health problems and illnesses*

**Today, let's write a letter to our recovery** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a biggie. My first letter to addiction was written in rehab, and to this day I remember how it starts: "I know where you live now"

**If the word addiction is throwing you off, try writing a letter to alcohol instead.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a "theory" out there that the opposite of addiction is connection.

Rather than comment on the theory (support group, not debate group!) how does CONNECTION play a role in your recovery?

**Today's Prompt** Write about a moment of connection, or a series of moments, that lit up your world. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Weekend Writing: My Recovery Analogy </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-21 17:09:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Lots of us, myself included, like to wax poetic...get philosophical...think about life.

So today: What's your recovery analogy? What is recovery like for you?

Recovery for me is kind of like renovating a house...and you're fucking living in it at the same time. In the beginning of the renovation, you're figuring out what structures you need to bring down and rebuild. It's about opening up walls, being completely unsure about what's behind them. It's about asking for help, inviting other people into your home, and asking: "Is this normal? How can we fix this?"

So SD: what's your analogy? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Weekend Writing: Valentine's Day Edition </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Legend goes that St Valentine was kind of an empathic guy.

Several martyrdom stories associated with the various Valentines that were connected to February 14 [...] including a popular hagiographical account of Saint Valentine of Rome which indicated **he was imprisoned for performing weddings for soldiers who were forbidden to marry** and for ministering to Christians, who were persecuted under the Roman Empire.According to legend, **during his imprisonment, Saint Valentine healed the daughter of his jailer, Asterius,[4]** and before his execution, he wrote her a letter signed "Your Valentine" as a farewell.

Turns out, "the celebration of Saint Valentine did not have any romantic connotations until Chaucer's poetry about "Valentines" in the 14th century."

And here we are today: chocolates and Hallmark cards.

**This week's prompt is simple: write yourself a love letter**

*If you can't write a love letter to yourself, write a love letter to the person you want to be.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last week we talked about things we wanted to forgive ourselves for. It was really powerful stuff...thanks to everyone who shared, thought, supported others or wrote at home. 

Action is the key to my recovery. Writing has been a powerful tool for me.

Last week was heavy. This week, let's lighten it up.

**This week, let's write a story/poem/haiku about where you are in your sobriety journey and what it's like to be in your shoes right now** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was quite the rollercoaster.

The people have spoken!!!

*I edited this because I suck at English. 

1. There is a story that is going to be written on reddit and its recovery forums, regardless of our inclusion or exclusion. We might as well go in with a voice and be welcoming to people. All people. Regardless of where they are in their recovery.

2. The mods and probably many members were impressed and humbled by the responses to keep things welcoming and inclusive. 

The black and white answers are

- Do it

- Don't do it

The middle way answer is:

- Be smart about it

**The middle way is not the easiest for many people who consider themselves alcoholics: but it's time to get smart about media attention.**

What does this mean:

- I am unsure when the article will be published

What we do know

- The mods are diligently working on a press package to put together in case this happens again. We want to ensure we are properly viewed and reported on by the media. This will be up in a week or so. Give us time please, it's a big decision. 

Until then, I will be forthcoming in the information I provide to this reporter. If anyone wants the emails I am sending, I will post the content.

	<TEXT> Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable.

- Bruce Lee

For me this quote is about my relationship with my sober self. At first, my love for sobriety and sober-Victoria was intense, loud, flickering and bright. As my sobriety has progressed and I have come to love and understand my self...my sobriety and self-love feels like a low rumble, a sort of...warm foundation. It's less reactive, it is less 'pretty' and isn't loud and roaring. My life isn't a bonfire anymore.

I remember in my early days of sobriety I wanted the whole world to be sober! I wanted everyone to share in my happiness and see that, you too, can be sober and happy. It was a child-like innocence of entering the world. And it was beautiful and it sustained me. Passion, opinions, getting heated on sobriety topics...these rekindled my values and lust for life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From Dune, 1984.

I'll miss the sea, but a person needs new experiences. They jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow. Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.

- Duke Leo Atreides

For me this quotes means waking up and opening my eyes...seeing the world for the first time, through the eyes of someone who had accepted her alcoholic fate and had a plan to become well.

	<TEXT> Trying out something new!

Journalling is a big part of my recovery. I love the process of writing and it helps me find perspective. 

The mods had this idea to do a "weekend writing prompt." Every week we will be giving a different prompt.

You don't have to share it here, but you are very welcome to!

**Today's Prompt**

**What is something that you want to forgive yourself for?** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.*

- William James

What this quote means to me: Being open in my heart and mind does not mean simply believing the same things, said differently. It means really listening, opening my heart and having compassion. It means I look at my prejudices and try to figure out their root cause (usually fear and shame).

I find that I used to think I was such a wise atheist/nihilist. But I was stuck. I had blinders on and wasn't open to the world. I would shut down anything and everything that didn't fit with my worldview.

Recovery means I get curious, and respond with compassion. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Out with friends and husband last night </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-24 22:41:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Went over to a friend's house for dinner. When my husband and his friends get together, they share some funny stories from their younger years.

The wives were all quiet about their own stories. Mostly because we're fairly reserved and don't have any shared crazy stories together. 

One of my buddies asked me: "VE, you tell us a story."

I realized: all my stories from my drinking years were not funny to these people. Hell, they are just generally not funny. 

What might sound like a funny/crazy story ends up usually with me drunk, almost dying, crying and alone. The stories end with me cutting myself, trying to take my life, ruining someone's property, or being verbally abusive. 

And a lot of my stories end with me peeing the bed.

My good stories, the funny ones, are from rehab. They are from AA meetings. They are simple stories about me finding solace in my webbed toes being named Bob and Bill when I was 3 years old. Then finding out that Bob and Bill are the founders of AA, and me accepting myself. Not exactly a party-worthy story.

I think this is part of the reason why I love sober communities and people. You guys get me, and I get you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.

Rumi

For me, this quote means that my attitudes, beliefs, values and opinions are the barriers to me finding peace and love in the world. If I come at the world with the right mind, I am open to the possibilities.

In my addiction and even in my recovery, I close myself off. I put up mental barriers (attitudes, expectations, unrealistic beliefs) that make me unable to see the truth or beauty in a situation.
