	<TEXT> In theory, raiding so many convoys in a small amount of time can cause real damage to the British, even forcing them to abandon convoys, if so high. In real life we could never know how it would work out, but in game right now it doesn't work that well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is true, thats why German U-boat campaign eventually failed. Interdicting enemy convoys can only hurt them, but will not completely stop them. Only a blockade can do that, and you can't do it. There's no reason for minors to build navies, but in real life every country was looking to get a dreadnought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never tested out making many small fleets, but one would lose the benefits of a good submarine admiral that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I experimented a lot with both Germany, Italy and UK on this matter. It seems that the only reliable way to find a lot of convoys is to cover the sea province you want to hunt with radar. That way your detection increases a ton. But if you don't have radar, your chances decrease a lot. Also, there's no way you can get radar to middle atlantic, and it takes time to build. UK for instance, is just vastly superior to Germany in terms of navy, and should be easily able to stop the German commerce. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its frustrating that even after declaring war on SU, Germany can still import rubber and oil he needs from the Japan (or any other country) without real naval interference. This makes them really powerful, and navy for any country useless. Don't you think this game needs a blockade system ? 


And yeah, without radar support U-boots can't find enemy convoys. They can't hunt at all in large sea provinces in Atlantic, even if you have like 300 of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One problem is Germany and axis powers overall never seem to have shortages of resources they had in real war. After Germany attacked SU, they couldn't buy enough of the resources, and could only get oil from romania. Naval system is broken, so we can't do blockades. If we were able to do blockades, it would be a good nerf to Axis power (and it would boost the power of navy as well. Why do you think several nations in 1900's did dreadnought races ?)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Line artillery. If I'd use the factories I use to build CAS to build arty instead, I can have more artillery divisions and I can afford to have more artillery in my standart lines as well. This adds up a lot of soft attack. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Close Air Support VS Artillery </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It seems to me like Close Air Support aircraft rarely join a battle, and do too low damage compared to land artillery. Aircraft is not affected by terrain and stuff, but it just seems like artillery is a lot cheaper and it just flatout does a lot of more damage. I've been experimenting with using no aircraft and instead using a lot of artillery, and it seems to work wonders as soft attack is just too high. What do you guys think ? </TEXT>
