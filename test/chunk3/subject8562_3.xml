	<TEXT> As a female who's been in intensive eating disorder treatment twice (for about 5 weeks), I've seen only three males in intensive treatment as opposed to many females. Two of these males were forced to come by their parents, because they were minors. There is definitely stigma around men receiving mental help. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What impact did the 14th Amendment have on the future gay rights movement? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I am completing a project on the impact of the 14th amendment. Though I Have found a good deal relating the topic to the 1960's civil rights movement and feminism, I'm struggling to connect it to the more modern gay right's movement.

I have cited Romer v. Evans, as well the Loving v. Virginia argument. Are their other helpful points I could use to connect the amendment with this movement?

Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *edit: i was referring to memorial day, but i suppose the question could be applied to either of days)

As someone against war, I feel extremely uncomfortable on this day. Though I don't want to come off as pretentious and unthankful, I have a very hard time thanking people for inflicting such violence upon others. How do you respect veterans, while keeping pacifism in mind? </TEXT>
