	<TEXT> Thank you guys! 3
Honestly she acts like shes 50 !

I wish you could all meet her. She does mostly everything by herself. Living at home with a family friend who just keeps an eye on her..  but trust me when I said Rose does not want or need any help!. She still goes shopping at the mall whenever she can, Sunday morning breakfast with family, watches Wheel of Fortune whenever she can. 

I went over to her house last month and there was a roast in the oven.. I was in shock after I found out she is the one who put it in there... could you imagine a 106 lady picking up a heavy roast, bending down to put it in the oven! 

She has a fashion sense better then half the people I know. 
The only thing bothering her these days is that her hearing is going... But she can still hear! lol

She is an amazing woman and that is why I am trying so hard to get as many birthday cards sent to her and make her world so much warmer once she receives them all.   </TEXT>

Please help make this the most loved birthday she has ever had. Gramma Rose knows that we are all wonderful people; lets celebrate her 107th year and let her know how admirable she is!
For as long as I've known her she has always loved reading and re-reading cards.
Please help out and be part of this amazing gift and send a birthday card, letter, picture, anything you like.

	<TEXT> This tank is anything but Claustrophobic It is very deep and I keep it very clean. My Roseline Sharks are my longest with the angle who have been in the tank. I know they are schooling fish which is why I have two. When I move out I plan to get a bigger tank with more Roselines. (my favorite fish which I know need a lot of room)

My temp is also good according to the fish store lol I keep it between 25-27C

I've had this tank and these fish for 4-5 years and they seem happy. 
I also think my tank is actually 56g
I understand any animal should not be locked up in a small area, but I am an animal lover and care a lot for my pets.  </TEXT>
