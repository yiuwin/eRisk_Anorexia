	<TEXT> 73% of Friday LPs have played on Sundays this season ([FO](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2016/injuries-post-probable-era)) -- the same rate as Questionable-designated players in general, of which many or most are LPs during the week.

I'm not saying Levy is likely to play this week. In fact, I'd be surprised if he did. But he has the practice report of a player who *is* likely to (though I think he had the same one last week as well). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same reason so many great shows have dismal ratings. The better the show, the less people that tune in, is often the correlation, as sad as it is. Halt and Catch Fire, The Americans, Mad Men, Rectify, etc... Drawn-out character-driven shows like that, especially ones with a lack of murder, don't tend to draw huge audiences. The more nuanced a show, the smarter, the less of a target audience you have, apparently. A lot of people simply prefer like their easy TV, I think. </TEXT>

 Im very driven by mystery in the stuff I watch and read and write. When I actually read the book (*The Leftovers*), I felt like true brilliance of the storytellingin addition to creating a world of characters that I cared aboutwas that its very explicitly stated that this isnt about resolving a central mystery. Its about living in a world with mystery, and how frustrating and upsetting that can be, and how it can unhinge people... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Talk to someone on Reddit. Most casual viewers care more about the immediate plot and characters.

There's a difference between watching a mystery show and going down vast reddit rabbit holes trying to figure out those mysteries. Watching this show is watching its mysteries, and with *Westworld* that's an outsize part of its story.

What can we talk about with the plot and the characters other than the mysteries that arguably define them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if that opinion would hold true for a significant portion of the viewership. For instance, the Reddit demo loveddddd *Stranger Things*, and I don't think it's a stretch to say that the majority of the Reddit demo isn't old enough for *Stranger Things* to trigger the nostalgia pleasure center. *Stranger Things* on its own merits was simply a terrifically fun show to watch. There's been a predictable reaction-to-the-reaction going on lately that feels disingenuous to me. Whether the excuse is "it's just nostalgia", or some thinly veiled low-brow criticism, I don't buy it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I guess the thing with Westworld is if you've only seen the first few episodes, like most reviewers do, then you don't really get a sense of the scope and complexity of where the show is going.

Why trust any review ever, then? Very rarely can a reviewer get a full season's worth of episodes before a show airs.

If anything I think opinions may have gotten worse as the season has went on, at least among people who weren't all-in from the get-go. The aspects many weren't keen on, placing "theorizing before character" (as /u/Sibbo94 wrote) for instance, haven't changed IMO. (As you may gather, I'm not a big fan of *WW* either, though I am still compelled enough to watch.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see why you're taking this big issue of diversity -- "Yes, they don't always play major roles...The fact that there are plenty of shows on TV currently with black characters isn't enough, and it probably never be, because there's always be someone to whine about it." -- and shrinking it down to a small situation of a show-runner being told one of his characters he had written for a white guy has to be black.

Despite it happening all the time for a variety of reasons, the idea with external factors having a say in a creator's vision isn't the most palatable, I understand that. These shows, especially network ones, are far from pure distillations of a showrunner's vision, though. They are vast concoctions of that vision, the network's help (and yes, sometimes interference), the other writers in the writers room's ideas, the BUDGET. Even if you want to focus in on this one hypothetical you're talking about, a character assumed to be white being cast as a black for instance, I imagine that would be far from the only, let alone the largest compromise made. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, there's a huge disparity of roles and jobs going to minorities (and women) in Hollywood, in relation to their population shares. (1) That *does* effect the money because those people watch TV, too. (Empire and Fresh off the Boat and Black-ish and the like showed the TV industry that recently.)

If nothing proactive is done about this, how will that change? Do you think all these white guys running things are going to all of a sudden interact with a smaller proportion of white guys and start developing more (let alone a representative amount) of diverse stories for television? Or start being acceptably open to casting roles for minorities? (Remember, Caucasian is a race, too; that's a choice.)

Even getting aside from the human aspect of this, the equality aspect for a second; I want the interesting stories, and there are troves that haven't been told yet in the name of a lack of diversity. Just look at what *Atlanta* has done creatively. *Black-ish*. *Jane The Virgin*. *Orange is the New Black*. Etc... Over-proportionlly limiting stories on TV to the worlds of white guys is very limiting creatively, if nothing else.

This is far more than the idea of artificially shoehorning the topic of race or diversity into a show. That's a strawman argument if there ever was one.

	<TEXT> Mostly becuase the Pistons were in a use-it-or-lose-it situation. They had money to spend; they won't in future offseasons. I think Boban's presence is why SVG is pumping up Baynes' value, hoping he opts out and ends up elsewhere next season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stan's praise is *so* effusive you have to wonder if there are some ulterior motives at play, like him subtly preferring Baynes opts out at the end of the season. They didn't sign Boban at 3/21 for him to get DNP-CDs for the next two seasons.

Of course Baynes isn't a starting-caliber center. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  HBO ordered a second season of *Westworld* this week, putting aside concerns over its huge price tag (one insider estimates itll cost the network around $100 million for another batch of episodes) and worries about whether the series can maintain creative momentum.

The future of this show is interesting. I'm not even sure I like *Westworld* but I'm compelled to keep following along. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  OWNs *Queen Sugar*, from Ava DuVernay, generated some of the seasons best reviews, **and it has consistently been one of the most-watched dramas on cable since its September premiere.** (The Oprah Winfreyrun network ordered a second season of the show before it premiered.)

That's pleasantly surprising. I've been enjoying this show. Kind of a great-looking Black Parenthood. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd argue Pistons fans think farrrr more of Baynes than any other fans. The national media, even, that I've heard talk about Baynes don't seem to be very high on him. Coaches like the guy because he's always in the right place and he's fundamentally sound, but he has some big limitations. He can't finish, he's not a threat in the pick and roll, he doesn't protect the rim. Look, he's a half-decent backup, and there's nothing wrong with that, but I think Boban for instance is a more impactful player. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All those guys in their ideal forms (i.e. in the eyes of the teams who like they the most, and pay them the most and get them) protect the rim. That's huge for a center in the NBA right now, especially if that guy can't step out and shoot the 3.

Baynes is a tough guy who tries hard, but he is limited physically and teams like to pay for projection.

Also, it will be a different market. Teams will have less cap space, and much less of them will need centers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think we have to judge at the end of the season.

I hate this argument. Each episode has to offer something. Regardless of whether or not you respect the form of episodic storytelling (which *Westworld* is by virtue of its release schedule if nothing else, and thus should be held to that standard), I'm not investing a handful of hours into a show with the hope of some payoff two months from now. What are we, 6.5 hours into *Westworld* at this point? </TEXT>
