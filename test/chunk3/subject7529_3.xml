	<TITLE> My best gaming experience </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-13 11:52:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was 10 and playing Pokmon Mistery Dungeon Red Rescue Team. My best and only friend had recently moved to another country, and as we used to play the game together and help each other I decided to finish it no matter what, for the two of us. The kind of silly thing a lonely kid does.

I somehow made It to the Sky Tower, but as I couldn't bring Absol, it was just me (Mudkip) and Charmander against the world.

The very first enemy we encountered was a Duskull that scared the heck out of me by flying over the walls. We got a lucky roll and recruited him,  things started to look a lot brighter now that we were 3.

With caution but determination we made our way across the Dungeon. Fighting some of the strongest 3rd Evo pokemon (metagross, Salamance and such), under Rain and hail, we pressed on and ascended.

After hours of torture we reached our goal, we were almost starved, short on supplies and facing God himself, Rayquaza, but this was no time for weakness.

We spoke, and he found our words meaningless, not that we expected anything else, battle was the language that had carved our way to victory.

He closed steps in all his glory and we waited in deadly motionless, ready to face a storm like no one before.

Charmander and I strike with our best moves, but we barely scratched the legendary, then Duskull made his best... and Rayquaza nodded and retreated. We had another free hit before we faced our death. Water and flame together made the Dragon feel pain for the first time in centuries, and once again, the Ghost made him cancel his strike, and so he did for another three times. 

But as victory shone in the end of the corridor, disaster struck, and suddenly Duskull was lying in the floor in the verge of death, yet not defeated. We charged in desperation before Rayquaza landed the killing blow, but Duskulls fate was sealed. In horror, I watched the Colossus lung forward and end his life.

But Rayquaza hadn't finished with us, after that, he attacked me and almost finished me in one hit. I found force in desperation,  water engulfed Rayquaza like a torrent, and  God fell to a water rat. Victory, but at what cost? Duskull, as a new recruit, didn't knew the way home when he fainted, and so he was lost forever.

After the epilogue (which was touching, but not as much as this experience) I saw all the unlocked territories, New adventures to be had, New friends to be made. I embarked on a mission to the grand desert. And as I entered, there he was. Duskull, like nothing had ever happened. I cried for the whole Dungeon. Up to this date, I still dont know how he returned, but no game has ever made me feel this overwhelming relief. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Grave robber and Hellion are very good for this fight because of their high damage and range, Give both of them some accuracy and make sure they can hit every rank. The grave robber will buff her acc with throwing dagger so she should consistently hit the matchman. Also, never assume that the next attack is going to hit the matchman, the 90% hit chance cap can mess you up really bad, always have a B plan in case someone misses.

A Vestal and a crusader would do great in this comp, to have both health and stress heals coupled with some stuns. </TEXT>

Also dont think too much about the people you lose, heroes will die, and they will stay dead, the most important thing is learning from your mistakes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The new prot is fine because he can only heal from the back ranks, as a tank (now he is one) he should always be in ranks 2 and 1, while the backline does damage (Thats also why his damage has been reduced, so that you need a properly dps class to help him).

The aoe stress heal is fine, the crusader has a crazy good one which he can cast from any rank.

I agree with this one.

I'd like to add another point to this discusin:

	<TEXT> Hi again, you can always chech a hroes stress level, rightclick them to enter their character page, you will see a White/Grey line in the right-top, just point at It with the cursor and you'll see their stress.

Resting in town will reduce their stress by a VERY small amount, and only to a 10 stress or so limit after several weeks of doing nothing.

The best way to deal with stress is using hroes with stress healing abilities (jester/houndmaster/crusader, jester being my favourite for stress healing) OR even better, not getting stress at all, learn which enemies inflicts stress and focus them down, if you kill all them before round 3 you are doing good. Also remember that heroes get stressed heasier if the Torchlight is lower than 75 </TEXT>

Plus none of those has HALF the style of our otherwordly prophet

Regarding the nerfs, I may have a... Slightly not common way of playing malzahar which might not get affected by the nerfs. Also I might write a post about it later. All I can say is the future is not always fixed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Greeetings, first thing, many newbies miss this one and its really important: character level means almost nothing in terms of Power, the ONLY thing they get when leveling up is some more resistance to stuns, bleeds and such and the ability to wear better equipment (If you can afford It). A lv 0 character is almost the same as a lv 2 character unless you upgrade him.

Number 1 priority should be the stage coach, you want to get all the fresh meat you can. The sanitorium is more of an end-game building. The only thing you want to do here in the begining is to cure diseases (super important) and the "cleptomaniac" quirk, which adds another sink to your incomes (which are going to be pretty low, as you can possibly tell by now).

It is strongly recommended not to sent a Hero if his/her stress is above 50.

Also, you didn't ask about this, but you should  be experimenting with all the characters and compositions, all of them are useful in some way.

Welcome to our deceased manor, we all hope that this experience helps you understand the nature of reality. Ask freely anything you want to know, even the most trivial details, people in this sub are generally nice and helpful, although some of us tend to amuse ourselves toying with newcomers. 

"Hit the small pig".

	<TEXT> Alright, RNG has decided to fuck up every single champion run you make, fine, let's bring the heavy artillery. It's my A team for when things get harsh in the Hamlet. If you feel like you aren't making any progress try this out. Oh, also SPOIKERS of some cove enemies.

This team is designed for the cove, and will probably suck in any other place (except ruins, maybe). However, its my super anti-Rng team, never ever finished a run with more than 10 stress (I repeat, in the cove). If you feel despert give It a shot, and once you get the hang of champion dungeons swap to other comps.

Rank 4

Plague doctor:

Skills: Single target blight, aoe backline blight, aoe backline stun, heal.

Trinkets: +20% blight, then stun chance. Blasphemous vial covers both and gives some delicious accuracy. Stack as much stun chance as you can.

Quircks: Whatever that gives her speed is good, accuracy is fine for the ocasional madman, reduced stress is great.

Role: Destroy the backline with your blight, blow them Up, if they are already blighted you can stun them or blight them for more, if you already stuned them with another character and they have the +40% stun resist don't worry, cove enemies have super low stun resist, she will easily overcome it, if they are still stuned stack more blight. Afterwars look for bleeds to heal, if there isn't any Plague grenade to the face of the frontliner. Always heal people out of Death's door, DON'T doubt, Death's door is ALWAYS the number One priority. Heal them at the first chance, always.

Rank 3

Vestal:

Skills: Heal, AoE Heal, Judment (the hit with a self heal), the stun.

Trinkets: Increased healing, all of it. Sacred scroll reduces stun chance but is good, take It if you can.

Quircks: Preference, I love scouting chance, but everything works.

Role: If you have a enemy with 60 or less stun resist on range, stun It, your stun has 109% chance with sacred scroll, if you can't do this, hit stress dealers with Judment, if there are no stress dealers or they are about to die because of blight, heal. If you can't heal, hit enemies with Judment. If you want to use the stun to increase the Torchlight instead of hitting thats fine. Always get people out of Death's door.

Rank 2

Crusader:

Skills: Smite, Stun, Holy lance, Inspiring cry.

Trinkets: +40% stun chance trinket, then Preference, I like tankiness.

Quircks: Preference.

Role: Stun things, If stress his high or you can't stun, stress heal, always prioritice the one with higher stress. If you get moved back Holy lance. Only use smite in One of the following: Nothing else to do/ You encountered a thrall (fat zombi), a squiffy ghast or a ghoul. They recibe more damage from smite because they are unholy, ALWAYS Focus the thrall first, stun him with the MaA (Next character) then just make sure the motherfucker is dead, DON'T give him half a chance to make a single move, a bad speed roll can fuck you, Focus him down inmediately. Get people out of Death's door with Inspiring cry, always.

Rank 1

Man at Arms:

Skills: Crush, Rampart (stun with move), Bolster (the speed buff, the dodge buff is nice but unnecesary), guard.

Trinkets: The +40% move and stun shield is glorious, then Preference (i like tankiness here too)

Quircks: Preference

Role: Stun in this order: thrall, squiffy ghast, stress dealers, enemy who is guarding a stress dealer, pirana, guarding enemy, jellyfish, whatever you prefer. If someone is in danger guard him, if you can't stun and everyone is safe, see if you can hit a stress dealer or KILL another type of enemy, if none of this is available, use Bolster to buff speed, if it has been used at least once, yoy can re-use It again or stun a enemy (they have probably lost the stun resist). If everybody is safe, Bolster has been used and no enemy can be stuned, you can use Crush.

When to camp: Only camp when One of these happens: Stress is above 50 for more than 2 people, Hp is lower than 50% for 2 or more people, you got a disease than will destroy your run, you finished the Dungeon and want to camp for some free stress healing.

Camping: Make sure you use One skill that prevents nightime ambushes, with this team the 4 time points are not worth the risk because their camping is not that great, as the MaAs damage buffs are almost useless. The vestal and the crusader can prevents the ambush, the Plague doctor NEEDS both disease curing skills, always use them if someone is sick, after both are done, Preference, I like stress healing has much as I can, and then using the vestals protectin buff.

Stalling:

This party is great for stalling, which consists on just healing your team or stuning the enemy, without killing them, these are some enemies you can use stalling with: Uca savage (Big crabs). Yes, you read correctly, you can stall Uca savages, their damage is super low, nothing the vestal cant solve in a single turn, their bleed isn't dangerous at all because you have a Plague doctor, the Man at arms can stun him or buff dodge, and the crusader Will just heal any stress you have. When you encounter an Uca, always kill the backline first, then stall and fully heal, even stress damage. Any combination of two of the following can be stalled: Cultist brawler, Guarding enemies (some day I'll learn their name), Jelly, Snails, Bandit musqueteer (if you can keep him in rank 1). Any other enemy will deal to much damage (be It heal or stress damage) to reliably stall.

How do I Deal with...:

Thrall: Number one priority, always, always, stun wtih MaA and throw everything you have at him. "But the squiffy ghast is..." number one priority, always.

Uca savage: Kill his backline with the plgue doctor while you stun him, then stop hitting him and stall to fully heal, his damage his negligible if you can heal his bleeds.

Squiffy ghast: Stun him and move him to the back rows, remember that the crusader does extra damage versus him.

Colector: Stun him at first chance, stack blight on him, stun any HWM head, stun MaA heads if they guard the collector, let the Plague doctor just stack blight on him, Vestal can hit him too if everyone is full hp.

Ghoul: Stun with crusader, stun his backline with MaA and Vestal (the MaA will usually go first and move the third enemy backwards so the vestal can stun the fourth), blight them both. When he is alone stack blight on him, hit him with crusader (he is unholy) and stun with MaA, have the vestal heal everyone just in case a crit rend happens, if everybody is full hp you can hit him with the Vestal.

Shambler: Dont use the goddam altar, Dont do dark runs. Thats all, easiest miniboss ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For Rumble try building an early Spirit visage to survive, abyssal is fine if you feel more confident or want to do more damage. In Lane there isn't much you can do, he melee Bully, you melee, he Bully you, pretty easy. The best advice is that you exploit any mistake he makes, because you rarely get the advantage, a example would be him being aggresive when he just hit the Max Heat zone, punish him for that, and punish him HARD. Also jungler can always help against Lane bullies.

You could also try building a zz'rot, objectives are super important and they buffed its damage, so you can gridlock him in toplaner to protect your team from his monstruos teamfighting.

For jax... Dunno, I tend to Rush a gunblade versus him for the Sustain, also, a good times slow can help you Dodge his e, and after that you probably won the tarde. Lategame things start getting much worse, Thats why you should try to use your gunblade and its amazing damage to snowball hard, get drakes and finish the game ASAP.

Also dont forget Magic res blues versus Rumble. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are in THAT part of the campaign, where you have to start doing champion runs to make real progress but your guys (and you) aren't yet completely ready. 

Slow down, cross your fingers, and stun the heck out of every enemy, you will overcome this, because you are merely grasping the truth of the horrors below, and the Darkest Dungeon keeps calling you, pulling you like a magnet, to the depths of the abyss.

Also good vid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm super excited about this. Our boy is finally seeing some light, maybe now Riot will tackle some of his issues or bugs, or at least put him a bit higher in the rework priority list.

Yes, I know, I know, It is still very unlikely to happen, but at least its not as unlikely as last week.

Also It was fun watching well known proplayers get beaten up by our necromantic juggy and his trusty mace.

Both Hp and stress heal, double guarding for emergencies. Extra damage vs: eldritch, human and beast. Mark sinergy, prot reduction. Good Range, some bleeds, moving, stuns, godlike camping. Doesn't get destroyed by shuffles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I have a Cold spell with 100 damage, and convert 100% of it to fire damage. How will this benefit from:

-%increased fire damage

-%increased cold damage

-%increased elemental damage

-%increased spell damage

If I understand correctly, 10% inc fire will give me 10 more damage, and 20 if I have 10% inc fire and 10% inc cold.10% Inc elemental will give me 20 damage and 10% inc spell damage will give me 10. Am I right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although It matches from a Lore perspective, I can't see It working in-game. How does a no-cc no-mobility juggernaut benefit from this? 

Sion continues to be a threat after dying because he is THE zoning champion, his abilities are not telegraphed only for counterplay, but also to help him send a message: gtfo of here or I shred you. His passive allows him to take all the damage he wants while he does so, because even if he dies he will still pose a threat (easily avoidable but still a threat) to the enemy team and zone them out.

Your idea for this rework is to take away all the tankiness mordekaiser has (passive shield) and compensate It with a super easily avoidable AoE damage after he dies, which he can barely control in a funcional way. Also you added some longer/shorter respwan gimmicks depending on certain conditions, I can't see how will help define his identity or make his playstyle more healthy.

So yeah, sounds cool from a Lore viewpoint, but It doesn't tackle the real issue with morde, his absolute dependence on feast or famine mechanics, and his lack of a deep Gameplay identity.

Look at warwick rework for example, he IS a beast, he WILL chase you down, He WILL get you no matter what. I often find myself mindlessly following the blood smell without even thinking about the enemy junglers most probable location and the situation of the rest of the map because OH BOY I SMELL IT BLOOD, BLOOD OH BOY I KNOW YOURE THERE BLOOD BLOOD I SMELL.

I want that for our metal master, I want him to be a towering necromantic raidboss, I NEED It, and this changes are absolutely not enough for this.

Of course, I'd ignore all of this if we lost the pizza feet when he turns into a mist pool of doom. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought it'd be cool if we shared our first characters and remember the good old times when we werent obssesed with things like double diping because we didn't even know they existed. Here I go.

His name was Mikael, he was born in late 2015, he was a Templar, he was a utter piece of messed garbage and I absolutely adore him.

I had no fucking clue of what I was doing so I picked up freezing pulse because I thought It looked cool... Just... That... Yeah.

So a friend told me NOT to build a glass cannon and to prioritice defense. My reaction, of course, was to pick every goddam life node in sight. Literally all I had on my Gear was defense, like... I beat standard malachai with 600 dps or some shit like that. I remember discovering auras on cruel (fucking cruel) and just going crazy because herald of thunder Increased my dps to 700.

I heard something about a labyrinth with really complicated traps so I decided I'd do It because It sounded like a fun challenge. Hours, fucking hours to get to the FIRST Izaro battle, and still getting my ass kicked. When I finally beat him in the last room I was euphric, and when I discovered that I could get a free enchant AND a new supper duper subclass pasives my mind imploded. I choose inquisitor for the fucking life regen on consecrated ground. I repeat, I choose, inquisitor, for the goddam life regen, on consecrated ground.

I played like shit, in fact, I still Play like shit, but this guy thought me everything I know about this game and introduced me to one of the best online communities out there, I love you guys, even during the Dota2 vs LoL ciclejerks in global chat. So thank you Mikael, and thank you all too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The veteran necro is quite similar to the apprentice one, just repeat the same strategy with levelled up guys. 

The only thing is that he has a chance (8% per summon i think) to summon a... particullarly troubling enemy. You might want to get some experience in the veteran ruins to learn how to tackle them before you go to the boss, because they can easilly wipe you if you get unlucky AND are new to them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like the idea of a 3 week event, and how the result in one affect the next quest. The event itself sounds really cool too. This sounds like  the kind of point that marks a turning point in a run. Also, I'm fucking terrified of fighting the new variants you designed, which is a good sign. Take your upvote, you magnificent bastard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. Absolutely yes. The only thing is that you'll need to stun the fuck out of everything. I recommend the Plague doctor + Hellion combo. Also try to get as much speed as you can, you want to kill the enemies before they get a single move. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, you did much better than I expected. You managed your resources pretty well and thought a strategy for completely New enemies in a matter of seconds, Thats really impresive man... Also, the first and second new enemies you found are not exclusive to the veteran weald, and its totally posible to find them in the other zones.

Dedicated stress healers are not mandatory in long runs unless you go to the ruins or the warrens. If you kill all the stress dealers in the first or second round you can heal all the stress with camping skills, random crits and some minor stress healing skill like the crusaders Inspiring cry.

And of course, the most important thing about this quests is to keep overconfidance as low as posible. Which you are doing quite well. But dont get overconfident in your overconfidance management. Fuck overconfidance. </TEXT>
