	<TEXT> I'm a graduate student looking to improve my philosophical writing, particularly crafting a cogent argument and characterizing objections accurately. If the community knows of any books/resources that can help me improve, I greatly appreciate it.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our education system. Speaking from personal experience, making community college affordable will do wonders to actualize potential that will most likely be wasted otherwise. This should be but one step to ensure people have access to higher education/vocational schools without carrying massive amounts of debt even *before* postgraduate education.

If we're serious about mobility among the historically marginalized, it would be great to start here.

	<TEXT> 30 page papers pretty much. It SUCKS to write them, but once you're done the feeling of accomplishment is beyond words.

Also, I get to work on things I'm really interested in so that helps the work go along nicely.

EDIT: I should also add that it varies by discipline. I do law and philosophy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's the process by which existing LCS orgs obtain a CS spot? Is it first come, first serve? Or would there be a play-in tournament for said slots? The ruleset vis  vis the CS slots need a lot of fleshing out, though I very much support what I did see.

A side note: it'd be interesting if the CS slots might be an opportunity for less established LCS orgs to build a base of talent that further protects them from relegation (if it goes right). I mean, if investors are that worried about relegation, that could be a viable option. </TEXT>
