	<TEXT> [Refeeding](http://jcdfitness.com/2010/06/the-preemptive-refeed/) is a thing I've been reading a lot about lately. It seems to be helpful for people who have been restricting for a long time and/or people who are plateaued/stalled with weight loss. A lot of long term dieters do a refeed every week or two to replenish leptin, boost metabolism, and a bunch of other sciency reasons I have forgotten.

I know there is a strategic method for going about a refeed, according to most articles I've read, but sometimes it seems like an impromptu fuck up day (or three!) once in a blue moon accidentally gets things moving again too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They recommend a dosage of 500 mg - 2g. I figure I'll start off with 500 mg and adjust from there. I have a scale and a capsule "machine" for other powdered supplements that I take, so I will just capsule this as well. I'm excited to try it out, I will definitely update!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I order a lot of supplements from this place, and I recently stumbled across
[this!](https://meridianbotanicals.com/index.php?main_page=product_info products_id=848)
I think I will order this instead of going to the pharmacy for Bronkaid again, and see what the results are. They also sell Yohimbe, which is great for appetite control/energy but can be a bit potent if you are not used to it/take too much. I personally can't take it in a stack or my heartbeat gets all wonky and I puke. 

Just thought I'd share. I'm a weirdo in the fact that I take all these natural supplements and vitamins and crap, and prefer natural treatments instead of pharmaceuticals, like I'm healthy or something lolol. Oh the irony.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Certain artificial sweeteners not only make me bloat, but give me horrendous stomach pains/discomfort. Whatever is in SF Jello is one of the worst for me. Sucralose doesn't bother me, neither do sugar alcohols in small quantities.

Salad/vegetables in general typically cause me some bloating but nothing too bad unless I eat a huge amount of them. 

I just keep simethicone gel caplets in my bag so whenever I feel bloated I can take a few and get some relief.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would just show up saying I had just gotten over a stomach bug and I was afraid to eat anything that rich because my stomach was still a bit queasy. Maybe bring a container of soup/broth or something light so you can eat while they eat, and so you don't feel suspect?

	<TEXT> There are so many, honestly. Music is my life. I'm not great at verbalizing my feelings so music does it for me. Warning, ginormo wall of lyrics ahead that may come out looking weird because I'm mobile right now.

**"Happy Hurts" by Icon For Hire:**

*I've been fighting so hard to come out of the dark,
Trying to turn of the night,
Finally letting the light,
Trying to make my misery just a piece of my history...
A little less victim, a little more victory

Happy hurts sometimes, blame it on the monsters in my mind, oh
I keep getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
what's wrong with me when happy hurts?

So today I feel OK, guess it was all just in my head
I just needed to try harder I guess...
Yeah everyone else in the world seems to be doing alright
Yeah, I'm alright for tonight
Can we let the pain and the happy mix
Can the two coexist?
The beauty next to the mess
Because I swear I have them both already beating in my chest.
If that makes me crazy the numbers don't lie but I don't call that crazy, I call it being alive*

**"Fight" - Icon For Hire:**

*My thoughts are racing faster than my body can react
The danger doesnt register, the fear feels like an act
Dont pull the plug I swear this isnt how I want to go
The sound of my heart pounding tells me theres still hope

But people dont like when you put up a fight
And slowly, ever so slowly, I am losing mine.*

**"Hope of Morning- Icon For Hire:**

*My mind's a kaleidoscope, it thinks too fast,
Blurs all the colors 'til I can't see past,
The last mistake, the choice I made,
Staring in the mirror with myself to blame.
Sometimes I'm afraid of the thoughts inside,
Nowhere to hide inside my mind,
I'm scared that you'll compare and I'll look a lifetime past repair.
I second guess myself to death, I re-solicit every step...
What if my words are meaningless? What if my heart's misleading this?
I try to capture every moment as it comes to me,
Bottle up the memories and let them keep me company.

When I'm old and grey, or thirty, or whatever happens first,
I'll need you to reassure me I didn't waste a verse.
Or worse, what if my life's work is reduced to just myself?
Like never let you get a word in, while I dissect my mental health.
Or lack thereof, whatever, there's too many things to track..
I really can't remember if I'm insane or insomniac.
Now days, all the kids want crazy, wanna diagnose themselves -
Trade up made up epidemics, pass around prescription pills.
**But my disorder can't be cured by a bottle, blade, or dose
Self-disgust and selfishness tend to hold me awfully close
But I don't wanna let you see that, I don't want my friends to know
Self-disgust and selfishness take me everywhere I go**

Try as I might to keep it together
Why is recovery taking forever
Fool the whole world, just until I get better
I'm terrified I'll be faking forever
On and on I wonder what went wrong inside my head
I don't have to have the answers, but tonight I wish I did
All the pain I can't explain away won't fade
All the the secrets silenced by the shame
Don't make me say it...*

That entire song. Just. I love Icon For Hire. Basically everything they write is relatable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh, I did the same thing yesterday. I literally feel like I woke up with a food hangover this morning. I am miserable. I stopped tracking my calories mid-day because I was already mortified and said "Fuck it, guess this is my cheat day." I think by late evening, I was just in some weird trance and had decided to see just how much I could actually eat. I don't typically binge, so I had no idea I was capable of putting that much food away. My brain was like "eat this next" and I no longer cared if it was something I even wanted. Yuck. 

Brains are douchebags. Mine better get on board with fasting for the weekend to atone for my food sins lol.

	<TEXT> I had a day like that today too. It's a miserable feeling. I ending up eating more than I am comfortable with, calorie-wise, trying to get some energy but Im still just drained. Try to get a good night's sleep and hopefully that will help. That's my plan as well, even though it's  midnight here and I need to be up in five hours, lol. Sigh. It *was* my plan. 

Hope tomorrow is a better day for you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always search the MFP database according to how I am preparing something, there is almost always an existing entry. So if I were making steamed broccoli and was going to weigh it after I cooked it, I'd search for "plain broccoli steamed" or "cooked". And then I'd look through several of the entries, to be sure they all were very similar. And then go to five other calorie counting sites. And then Google it for good measure, because paranoid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Instead of cheating with bad foods, I just usually allow myself a couple hundred extra calories on the weekend and try to do the whole eat til I'm full thing with healthy foods.

I've found if I give in to my cravings with "just a taste" or "just a small portion", all hell breaks loose, lol. It doesn't satisfy my cravings, it just makes them worse. Same with cheat days, if I give myself an inch, I will take a mile..so I just don't. Well, 99% of the time lol. I was never good at moderation. It's either eat very little or eat **all the things.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Between 500-650 a day, typically, depending on my energy requirements for the day. My job is pretty physical so some days I need a little more intake than others.

I eat a lot of grilled chicken breast, grilled zucchini, grilled lean beef and pork. Eggs, low fat cheese, salads. My main focus is on getting enough protein in. Sometimes during a busy day I'll grab a Quest bar and call it a meal but I think I'm going to cut those out as they seem to make me crave sweets more.  </TEXT>
