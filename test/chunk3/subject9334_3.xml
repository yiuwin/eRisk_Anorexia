	<TEXT> I just can't fathom how you can argue welfare for something just to kill it, it's just a nice gesture but so barbaric. 

Welfare is the health, happiness, and fortunes of a person or group, when did you last see the chickens fill in a survey on their lodgings and food? 

The chickens in the farms I've witnessed are large buildings with no natural light, feed in lines and it's like you're at the front row at Leeds Fest, full full full. 

The chickens obviously don't go to the toilet and wipe so they do their duty on the floor, thousands and thousands. The ammonia would make your eyes water (doesn't matter about the chicken). Then all the chickens sit and sleep in their own stuff. 

Sometimes infections take place and these guys can't go to the doctor, and as they have thousands of other camp mates no one notices the one with an infection. Poorly chicken doesn't even get eaten (doesn't matter about the chicken). 

I'm just passionate about all life and trying to understand others people's view and opinions, nothing is personal!

	<TEXT> The slaughterer men take great pride in ensuring the principles of animal welfare? Animal welfare and killing them.. Bit of an oxymoron I see. This post is full of cognitive dissonance. Humanely slaughtering is not a thing, it dies. Kill it by dropping it off a bridge, slashing its throat, stunning it, still leads to the end product of meat on a plate.

No one has addressed the stress the animal undergoes whilst being prodded and poked into a small enclosure where it gets slaughtered, or the abuse they undergo before they are slaughtered, so why does it matter if they feel their throat get ripped apart?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Online dropshipping website </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-05 15:42:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Basically wanting to start a business up that functions like amazon but just for vegan/fairtrade clothing and other items. I have made a list of companies that I would like to work with, including websites url's, emails and rough items that they sell. 

I am working with the idea that dropshipping would be a good place to start with as I am unable to keep the goods at a warehouse or purchase the stock myself. 

This isn't a business I'm wanting to make loads of money from, it's something I feel people will find useful! People are becoming more conscious about the environment and the resources we are using, we need to be ethical and having a site like this would facilitate peoples shopping habits onto one platform!

Anyone with ideas that could help? </TEXT>
