	<TEXT> Every time I've played this map as a non-Hun civ, I always got population-constrained in the feudal age. You just can't fit enough houses to keep pumping out vills to gather wood. Chinese have a stronger start, but I would think that triple Huns would offer the best feudal/castle sling by far -- simply because they can get out far more vills than anyone else (and save space for more farms = more food). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really? I would think that Huns, Huns, Huns, Celts would be the most efficient sling. Huns don't have houses limiting their population size. I think this factor would dominate economically. On top of that, once the celts have cut a path, the hun players can spam a trash army without being population-constrained. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure exactly what the statistics are (you could test it out in the scenario editor), though I'm pretty sure that skirms are the most cost-effective solution.

However, that may vary depending on the archers and range bonuses you available: British longbowmen, for example, will perform very well against janissaries since elite longbows have 6+6 range, so they will land a number of free shots before the janissaries (8 range) can even begin attacking them. </TEXT>

Note that Huskarls and Condottiero can perform reasonably well against Janissaries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "So they do less damage" doesn't change anything. By the time you can afford the Onager/SO upgrade, you can also afford to mass them, so you can easily get the same total damage output.

Onagers with 13 range and a meat shield in front are effectively not counterable. Only trebuchets, cannon galleons, and turkish bombard cannons outrange them. This renders them extremely OP. 

It's important that SO has a maximum range of 11 so that players can use bombard cannons (range 12) to counter them.

To answer your question: massing 8+5 Onager is much better than massing 8+3 SO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Suppose that you have a modest investment in the market -- maybe you hold SPY -- and you read the newspaper to get the prices once a day. And then suppose that the market starts turning the way it did in August, and you get scared. What do you do? The folks at 538 wrote a piece that says you should not sell, and instead simply hold on to your assets. 

I wanted to test whether they told the truth. I used algorithmic trading techniques to find whether there's a simple strategy that a lay investor can use to beat the market in such a scenario. 

I used parameter optimization on some 5000 backtests, testing slightly different strategies that a lay investor might use (i.e. sell after some drawdown, buy back after some rebound) to avoid big downturns like the ones in 2008.

My parameter-optimized results indicated that while some backtested strategies substantially beat the market, these strategies are dangerously overfit to a very small sample (despite testing over a 13-year window, we've really only had two major market downturns in that window). Since the next major economic downturn is likely to be quite different from the last two, any one of these parameter-optimized strategies is not safe to use going into the future. 

I conclude (somewhat unsurprisingly) that there's no simple, lay investor strategy that ensures market-beating returns in times of economic downturn. 

You might be interested in [reading my research project](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/market-panic-parameter-optimized-strategy-for-lay-investors), in which I go through the steps of parameter optimization, develop a fine-looking result, poke holes in it, and ultimately reject it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't day trade with $7000. Just stick it in SPY or a Vanguard Index Fund and let that do the work for you. There are two reasons why:

[1] You don't have the cash required to use one of the brokers with lower fees (at least not that I am aware of). If you day trade with $7k, fees will eat your entire profit margin.  

[2] If you stick your $7k in a market-tracking ETF, like SPY, you're probably going to get returns of 5-10% in the next 12 months. That's $350-700, no work involved.

Now suppose you wanted to day trade and *beat the market*. Suppose you want to spend an hour every day, and achieve 20% returns over 12 months. (That's *hard*. I assure you: it's really hard.) So what's 20% returns on $7k? It's $1400. At the most, that's going to be $1050 more than you would've made off SPY. 

However, you're going to spend a lot of time doing market research and trading, etc. An hour a day sounds like a conservative estimate. There are usually 252 trading days in the year, so you can expect to spend 252 hours. Is it worth it to work 252 hours for $1k? No, that's a wage of about $4/hour. And that's before you factor in taxes and aforementioned fees, *and* with an extremely optimistic prediction of 20% returns, which even most hedge funds do not achieve. 

It's really important to think about the real, end-of-the-day dollar gains that you stand to get from this. They're very small, probably negative, and certainly not worth your time.

The best use of your time will be to stick your cash in a market-tracking ETF and, instead of wasting a ton of hours day trading, picking up another skill, job, or working on another passive income stream. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's common play to stone-wall. I don't do it. 

In the feudal age, a decent house-wall or a double palisade is just as effective as a stone wall, while being nowhere near as expensive. In the castle age, stone walls don't help against rams/mangonels/etc., so I find that it's a much better defense to get out some knights. In imp, if you're attacked to the point that you need walls to save yourself, you've probably lost anyway.

So I use stone walls only very rarely, in specific situations that merit it. Most situations don't. 

EDIT: Wow, -2. Surprised this drew so much negativity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Bailing" usually equates to a loss of thousands of resources invested in buildings, time to get your vills across the map, and time to rebuild everything, as well as loss of map control over vital resources (assuming you built your TC near gold/stone).

In terms of cost, bailing is often a game-losing move, unless your allies are significantly better players than your opponents.

I only ever bail if I've lost everything. Here's why: if you're surrounded by enemies, you can turn their aggression into an advantage. If you're surrounded by two or three opponents, that implies that only one of their opponents is elsewhere on the map. Your allies basically have the entire map to themselves. And as long as your opponents are focused on you, your allies can *significantly* outboom your opponents. That's because your opponents will have to spend resources in order to hit your base. 

So what you want to do is waste as much of your surrounding opponents' time and resources as possible. Wall their gold/stone in the dark/feudal age. Stonewall wherever necessary. Place towers. Spam trash. Your goal is to slow them down and drain as many of their resources as possible, so that your allies (assuming they are competent) can outboom your opponents, and eventually swoop down on them with a massive advantage. 

That being said, if you do find yourself surrounded in such a way that your eco is endangered or you cannot expand effectively, it may be a good idea to walk six vills to somewhere else on the map when you hit the castle age, and to build a TC/boom there. Continue defending your first base in effort to slow down your surrounding opponents.

In conclusion: don't think about being surrounded on three sides, think about being able to lame three of your opponents at once. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never played AOE:O, but it was very interesting to see this breakdown. Modern online 'casual' gaming is extremely competitive, so certain business-strategy mistakes will easily torpedo the entire game. 

I think the presenter's assessments seem broadly accurate, though a few of his statements (e.g. on PvP players being a loud minority) strike me as false -- perhaps spun that way to excuse the failure.

Particularly strong insights were:  
* No soft launch for a branded game  
* Need low price point to entry for expansions and no spend limit   
* Failure to maintain users on launch was critical  
* Lack of marketing tools to bring in new players   
* Eventually, "more of the same" content, even if very good, won't bring in new players.
