	<TEXT> I don't like having new rules of time travel every time I watch a new show.  It is bad writing.  There are certain things that are common in time travel shows or movies.

1) Time loops.  Examples: Terminator 1, 12 Monkeys.  When you have a time loop, you can go back in time but your actions end up causing the events you intended to prevent.  Every loop is exactly the same.

2) Alternative time lines.  Examples: Time Cop, Time Cop 2.  The idea of an alternative time line is basically "What if?" such as "What if the Nazis won WWII?"  In this scenario, if you go back in time and change the past then you create a new time line and when you return to the present everything has changed.

3) Many Worlds.  Examples: Terminator 3, Terminator: Genisys.  In this scenario, you go back and change the past but the future remains unchanged.  Why?

Basically, it is because the old time line and the new time line exist in parallel.  Think Schrodinger's cat.  When you open the box the cat is either alive or dead but until you open the box the cat is in a mixed state: it is neither dead nor alive.

Logically, in this scenario it is impossible to actually change the past because doing so would violate causality: if you change the past then why do you go back in time in the first place?  At least the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics allows us to go back in time and superficially make changes even if the future remains unchanged.  We can say that once you have seen the future then the future becomes inevitable and no matter what you do differently the future you saw will always come to pass.

These are the rules that good sci fi shows and movies follow because they make sense.  Shows and movies will add their own rules not because they make sense but because they are required for the narrative.  For example, a lot of shows and movies claim that it takes a while for the time line to "set" and that gives you time to change things back but that's not based on any known physics and is just a narrative device designed to create tension. </TEXT>

Catwoman is the only one that is straight up bad.  Ghost Rider 2 is a poorly directed film based on an okay script.  Suicide Squad is a well directed film based on a mediocre script.  And Ryan Reynolds was miscast as Hal Jordan.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes you watch a movie in the theater and think "This is really bad" and then you see it again on TV and you think "It's not terrible."  Sometimes the anger you feel having to pay to see an awful movie angers you more than having to watch the same movie when there's nothing else on.  That's been my experience with The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man II.  It helps that the Hulk went on to be better in the Avengers and that Thunderbolt Ross, Rhodey, Tony and Natasha were all in Civil War because you appreciate those movies as preludes to better movies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree.  The current Marvel Now has the All New All Different Avengers with Falcon, Miles Morales, Ms Marvel and Nova.  It is inevitable that we will see less of Captain America, the Vision, the Hulk, Iron Man and Thor as the actors who play them age.  Also, Marvel has been introducing a lot of new characters (including female and "ethnic" characters) in the comics that they will eventually want to use in movies.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Moon Knight: This has long been rumored as a Netflix series.

Nova: Well, we do have the Nova Corps from Guardians of the Galaxy and we will have the Guardians in Avengers: Infinity War so we will see what develops in Phase 4.

She Hulk: The Hulk solo movie had set up a possible She Hulk spin off very well.  Banner wanted his blood destroyed but I really doubt if Thunderbolt Ross had the blood destroyed seeing as how that was what he wanted all along.  With Banner's blood he can make more Hulks including Hulks that don't lose their mind in the process. 

Ghost Rider: This is strongly rumored to be an upcoming Netflix series.  If they bring Ghost Rider back on Agents of SHIELD and they get a ratings bump then perhaps Netflix will agree to distribute a Ghost Rider series.  As was the case with the Punisher, an actor is already cast and fans are happy with him.  They just need to cast Johnny Blaze for the flashbacks.

Blade: The Darkhold is supposed to be dangerous but how dangerous is it?  Is it dangerous enough to release a horde of vampires on Earth.  Will we have Blade come out of retirement saying he is "too old for this shit" so he will train a new team of Nightstalkers?  Sounds like a plot for Agents of SHIELD Season 5.  If it works it could be spun off into a Netflix series.

Thunderbolts: Well, we do have Punisher and Elektra.  Another possible addition would be Spider-Woman and the previously mentioned Moon Knight.  Let's have the Thunderbolts from the Punisher / Elektra run go up against the Dark Avengers who were the original Thunderbolts from the comics.  Marvel might not be allowed to use Norman Osborn in a Netflix series so we could have Wilson "Kingpin" Fisk form the Dark Avengers instead.

Taskmaster: Ant Man / Hawkeye villain.  Obvious choice for Ant Man 3 if not Ant Man and the Wasp.

Venom: Problematic.  They could introduce Venom in a Spider-Man movie and then have Venom face the Avengers but Marvel's deal with Sony doesn't say anything about a Venom movie.

Sinister Six: Problematic.  They could introduce the Sinister Six in a Spider-Man movie and then have the Sinister Six face the Avengers but Marvel's deal with Sony doesn't say anything about a Sinister Six movie.

New Avengers: You mean other than the Defenders, the Guardians, the Runaways and the New Warriors?  Seriously, I could see Spider-Man, Nova, Quasar, White Tiger, Ms. Marvel, Kate Bishop and Miles Morales being a new iteration of the Avengers in the distant future with Spider-Man taking the role of Tony Stark and Miles being his Rhodey.  Or maybe they will save Kate Bishop for a Young Avengers TV show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jefferson Pierce made his choice: he hung up the suit and his secret identity years ago, but with a daughter hell-bent on justice and a star student being recruited by a local gang, hell be pulled back into the fight as the wanted vigilante and DC legend  Black Lightning.

The "star student" could be Static.  According to Wikipedia, the character has two daughters.

"Jefferson has had two daughters by his ex-wife Lynn Stewart, both of whom have followed in his footsteps and become superheroes. His oldest daughter, Anissa Pierce, has taken on the name "Thunder" and served on an incarnation of his team the Outsiders and his sixteen-year-old, younger daughter, Jennifer Pierce, was recently recruited by the Justice Society of America under the code name "Lightning"."

So there could be three or four characters on the show with the same powers.

We don't know where the series will be set.  Setting it in Detroit would make guest appearances by Vixen and the Flash easy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me.

I acknowledge that different people watch porn for different reasons.  I don't want to watch anybody experiencing pain so I'm  not interested in bondage / domination or sadomasochistic porn.  In most countries bondage / domination and sadomasochistic porn is illegal anyway.  In the U.S. it is illegal to portray rape in porn so if they portray bondage / domination or sadomasochistic porn it has to be consensual.  Of course, with the internet people can find anything.  For the record, I am only interested in porn involving consensual adults.

I also don't like to watch anal sex, partly because it looks gross and partly because anal sex is more likely to cause tearing and thus is not safe and potentially painful for the girl.  Of course, if the girl is into it then I'll watch.  I've seen scenes in which the girls obviously weren't into anal sex so I would just fast forward through that.  I've seen scenes in which the girls obviously were into it so I'll watch the scene but focus on the look on the girl's face and not on the penetration, which I still think is gross.

I'm also not mad about oral sex.  If the girl has a pretty face then watching her give a blow job would be entertaining, especially if her face makes her look like a famous actress I might fantasize about.  In Western porn, the blow jobs tend to go on a bit too long though and I'll get bored and fast forward.  In Japanese porn, it is the cunnilingus that tends to go on and on and on with the guy using toys to stimulate the girl.  This is something I will definitely fast forward through, especially if the porn is censored.

What I do like is vaginal insertion and internal cum shots.  I like watching the cum drip out.  I prefer internal cum shots to facial cum shots.  Facial cum shots can serve to humiliate the girls: some girls even flinch when the guy comes on their face which tells me that they don't like guys coming on their face.  I do like it, however, when girls give blow jobs and the guy comes in the girl's mouth and it looks like the cum is going to drip out of the girl's mouth but then she swallows it all.

I don't like fat girls.  Nor do I like girls who are so thin that you can see their bones.  I like girls that have muscular abs.  I like butts that look like they are made of muscle and not fat.  I prefer women with a nice tan and not women who are pale.  I think it is perfect when a girl is the color or chocolate or caramel.  I like women who look good enough to eat.   (I really enjoy watching Sleepy Hollow with Nicole Beharie, Scandal with Kerry Washington and America's Next Top Model with Tyra Banks.  My favorite porn stars include Misty Stone, Lydia Chanel and Lacy Duvall.)  I like watching white dick fuck black pussy because I imagine that it's my dick in that pussy.

I like Asian girls, especially Thai, Filipino and Chinese girls.  The appeal of Chinese girls is that you don't see a lot of Chinese girls in porn so it is exciting to see a girl who is Chinese and not Japanese.  Plus, Japanese girls are a lot paler than other Asian girls.  I do, however, really enjoy watching black men fuck Asian girls.  I can't say for sure that black men have larger dicks than white men or Asian men but it certainly is true that there are black men with freakishly large dicks and watching a small Asian girl take a freakishly large black dick in her pussy drives me absolutely insane with lust.  I especially like it when the fit is so tight that the pussy appears to grab hold of the man's dick. Whether the dick is white, black or Asian, I always imagine it is my dick that is stretching the pussy.

I prefer watching porn without condoms.  Obviously if the scene is going to end with an internal cum shot then there can't be a condom so if there is a condom then I know I am going to be disappointed by how the scene ends.  I also know from experience that sex feels better without a condom.  I want to fantasize about fucking a girl without a condom and cumming inside her so, of course, that's what I want to see.

I enjoy watching girl's getting fucked doggy style.  I also like watching girl's riding on top of guys.  I like watching the dick going in and out of the woman's pussy.  I especially like the moment that the dick penetrates the pussy, especially if the girl gasps with pleasure: I want to see the dick penetrating and the look on the girl's face in the same shot.  It's great when a girl is lying on her side and the guy is behind her, especially if she has a nice body: I get to see her face, her body and the dick going in and out of her pussy all at the same time.

I like big tits.  I like small tits.  I don't like big fat tits that flop around.  I like tits that a guy could stick his dick between and get off that way.  That's called "cleavage".  I similarly like an ass that is tight enough that a guy could dry hump a girl and cum, although obviously I would be disappointed if that was how the scene ended and there never was any penetration.

I don't like tan lines.  I like girls that are evenly tanned all over.  I want to believe that this is the girl's natural skin color, even if it isn't.  I like girls who are exotic.  I'd even enjoy a girl with pitch black skin getting fucked by a white guy, as long as she isn't fat or has a buzz cut hair style.  I love girls with long, straight hair.

The best thing ever is when the girl goes "ugh" with every thrust that the guy makes, which means she is really enjoying getting fucked.  I get annoyed when girls go "iiieee iiieee iiieee iiieee" over and over again because it sounds fake.  I do like hearing girls saying things like "Fuck me!" or "Fuck me harder!".  I hate it when girls look like they are going to start crying during sex: this is a problem with a lot of Japanese porn.

I actually really wish that my favorite actresses and singers would do porn because I really would like to see them getting fucked.  It would be the next best thing to fucking them myself. 

One caveat, of course, is that I don't enjoy porn quite as much as I used to.  I used to be able to cum in minutes, continue jerking off and come again over and over until I would pass out.  Now, it takes seemingly forever for me to cum.  If I continue to watch porn then I might get hard again and cum a second time.  Thing is, porn is boring when you aren't into it.  I might have to fantasize about something other than what I see on screen in order to get hard and reach a climax.  I will often open multiple windows on my computer and alternatively watch different scenes in order to get excited and reach orgasm.  I have seen other people on reddit admit to doing this as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends.  JJ2 will start filming right away but DD3 probably will start later because the show runner of DD has been doing The Defenders and will need time to prep the third season of Daredevil.  There hasn't been any announcements with regards to casting DD3.  The Defenders is filming right now so I imagine JJ2 will film in the spring, DD2 in the summer, LC2 in the fall and IF2 in the winter.  Thing is, they aren't going to release 4 seasons in 2018 so there's no rush.  DD3 might not start filming until the fall.  They may start filming a follow up to the Punisher before IF2 because the Punisher is considered a spin off series.  

Basically, by staggering the series and not filming them at the same time they will make it easier for characters to appear in each other's series.  I mean, we expect ron Fist to show up in LC2 so they would have to finish LC2 before starting IF2, for example. </TEXT>

Second, the follow up movie Avengers: Doom has Doom in the title so it is his movie and we will see his rise to dictatorial power, his obsession with magic, his Stark-level technological genius, his descent into madness and his insane manoeuver to kill the Avengers and the Fantastic Four.  He just never had any reason to attack the Avengers until Reed Richards showed up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow.  We finally know how the Sony / Marvel deal works.

If Marvel wants to use Spider-Man in Civil War then they need to make a Spider-Man movie.  If Marvel wants to use Spider-Man in Infinity War then they need to make another Spider-Man movie.  Apparently Marvel will have to do a movie for Sony every time they use Spider-Man in an MCU movie they will have to do a movie for Sony.

Alas this means that Norman Osborn could not be a villain in Avengers movies unless he came as a package with Spider-Man.  On the other hand, if Marvel did a Sinister Six movie for Sony they could presumably have the Avengers fight the Sinister Six in an MCU movie,

Marvel's deal with Constantin Films for the Fantastic Four is different, of course.  If Marvel waits until 2025 then they will be able to start using the Fantastic Four in the MCU.  Feige might want the rights back before 2025 but Disney isn't going to want to spend money to buy back rights that they can just wait for.  If Fox starts working on a new Fantastic Four movie then the situation could change.  Disney could allow Feige to produce a Fantastic Four film for Fox in exchange for a Fantastic Four cameo in an MCU movie.  If Fox wanted a sequel then they would have to let Marvel have another cameo and so on.  That could work.  </TEXT>

Talk of a Namor movie first surfaced in 1997, and several scripts were written but ultimately unused, and the character was optioned by Universal in 2001 at a time when the superhero boom was just taking off thanks to the likes of Blade and X-Men. Marvel was recovering from near-bankruptcy at this point, and the sale of the movie rights to characters including Hulk, Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four helped keep it afloat.

Development of a Namor movie stalled for several years until 2004, when Christopher Columbus was brought in to direct a film based on a script by David Self. Columbus left the project a year later and was replaced by Jonathan Mostow, but again the project was seemingly dead in the water (sorry) for a number of years.

In 2012, at a convention in the UK, Joe Quesada claimed that the rights to Namor had lapsed and reverted to Marvel Studios. Paul Rubin, a concept designer, gave an interview to ComicBook.com where he talked about his work on Universals Namor movie, and described his planned approach.

its a little bit medieval, its a little bit of a fairy tale kind of a setting both in the social structure and also in the way everything is designed. To take that and to find a cool, science fictional grounding for it

In 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that Namor was still at Universal while answering questions about the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ...

In May 2014, it was rumoured that Universal Studios and Legendary Pictures were teaming up to make a Namor film, but that was refuted less than two weeks later by Kevin Feige, who said in an interview with IGN that Marvel once again had the rights to Namor but it was still a complicated matter they were working to untangle.

Yes, but its slightly more complicated than that. Lets put it this way  there are entanglements that make it less easy. There are older contracts that still involve other parties that mean we need to work things out before we move forward on it. As opposed to an Iron Man or any of the Avengers or any of the other Marvel characters where we could just put them in.

These complications probably explain why Namor, like the X-Men and the Fantastic Four, has been absent from all recent Marvel video games and animation.

This week Joe Quesada confirmed that he thinks the rights are back at Marvel in his interview with Kevin Smith, but he was rather uncertain in his language.

I cant speak for studios As far as I know, yeah we do. Its not at Fox, its not at Sony Yeah.

Joe Quesada is Marvels chief creative officer, so the rights to the characters are certainly in his remit, but the answer isnt as definitive as some fans may like, and Quesada has been wrong on this matter in the past.

When asked whether fans might see Namor in the movies soon, all Quesada would say is that he cannot confirm or deny, which still leaves the future of the character in doubt.

When Feige says "other parties" that definitely includes Universal but I am confused as to whom else it refers to.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is not that Universal does not want Marvel to make a Hulk movie.  The problem is that Hulk movies are not profitable enough to justify making when they have to share the profits with Universal.  Universal has the same problem with Namor.  They would like to do a Namor movie but they really don't know how to to go about doing it and Marvel doesn't think it is a strong enough property to justify doing a stand alone movie when they would have to share profits with Universal. </TEXT>

They went out of their way to establish that Johnny Blaze existed but never cast an actor to play him.  If they introduce Blade they might do a similar thing, ie introduce a young vampire as a hero fighting and killing other vampires and have him mention that Blade is also out there fighting against vampires and thus establish that Blade exists in the MCU and allow viewers to establish their own head canon as to whether or not the Blade movies are part of the MCU. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't want the X-Men to be part of the MCU.  The MCU already has Inhumans and the Sokovia Accords.

I also don't want the Fantastic Four in the MCU unless, as someone else said, they first appeared in the 60s and have been in the Negative Zone all this time.  It could be like Interstellar where the heroes have been away for a few hours but decades passed on Earth.  

The MCU doesn't absolutely need Doctor Doom.  The MCU could have its own Doctor Doom like Sokovian political figure who wants revenge against the Avengers.  Oh, wait, that's Baron Zemo.  There you go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The comics and movies already are political.  

Stan Lee created a character called the Black Panther.  There was a Black Panther party in the U.S. at the time.

Speaking of the Black Panther Party, there was a similar organisation in the Avenger comics.  They and a KKK analog were revealed to both be working for the Hate Monger.

When Stan Lee created the X-Men, he had Martin Luther King and Malcolm X in mind as models for Professor Xavier and Magneto.  Later versions of the X-Men made the analogy with homosexuality, especially the scene in X-Men 2 where Bobby came out to his parents as a mutant.  Brian Singer is gay in real life.

The Secret Empire in the comics was a clear jab at the Republican Party in that the President in 70s Captain America comics was said to be a member of the Secret Empire.  We never saw the President's face and this implied that the President in question was in fact Nixon.  (George Bush senior appeared in a 90s Avengers comic so they weren't doing fictional presidents in the comics.)

Mutant Registration and Superhero registration and their consequences hearken back to the the treatment of Native Americans, the Nazi holocaust, the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII and the persecution of illegal immigrants.  

The Watchdogs on Agents of SHIELD are basically a right wing extremist group.  The Inhumans are essentially Muslims in that they are, ironically, branded as terrorists by the Watchdogs.  The comics even have a character who is both Inhuman and Muslim.

Earth-9997 Norman Osborn did become President of the United States.

In the mainstream comics, Norman Osborn became the government appointed director of the Thunderbolts following Civil War.  He later became Director of SHIELD and the head of national security in the US, became Iron Patriot, was put in charge of the Avengers 50 state initiative and formed the Dark Avengers using the original members of the Thunderbolts.  He later formed his own X-Men team with members consisting mostly of X-Men villains.

	<TEXT> Wow.  That's actually kinda cool.  It completely invalidates the movies though.  They had two Ghost Riders in the first movie.

EDIT: Turns out the sequel Ghost Rider (Spirit of Vengence) established that Johnny Blaze was possessed by the demon Zarathos.  The second Ghost Rider in the first movie was just a cool Easter egg.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarathos

Apparently, Johnny Blaze was also possessed by Zarathos in the comics.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Rider_(comics)

Anyway, this gives us the opportunity to have a Netflix series that flashes back to Zarathos fighting Mephisto and Mephisto bonding Zarathos to Johnny Blaze to make the first Ghost Rider.  

Actually, in the comics, Carter Slade did not become a flaming skeleton.  While it was cool in the first Ghost Rider movie it is not true to the comics.  We can assume that Carter Slade in the first Ghost Rider was possessed by a different daemon both in the movies and comics.

	<TEXT> For now, the companys film and television arms continue to make sure each of the superhero stories can stand alone, no matter the size of the screen. We certainly communicate with each other in terms of what were doing and what we have planned and the characters that were using and where its all going, Loeb says of working with Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, who oversees the films. That helps limit the fatigue, but also poses a personal problem for Loeb: Unfortunately for me as a fan, he says, I tend to know more about whats happening in the movies than I want to know. Only fans receive spoiler alerts, after all.

	<TEXT> I would prefer something with a tight pace.  Consider Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice: the story was unnecessarily convoluted and the movie outstayed its welcome.  If I had to guess as to what the plot of Infinity War was going to be I would say that it involved Thanos collecting five of the six gems and then he battles the Avengers in order to get the mind gem from Vision.  Incredibly the Avengers turn out to be too much for him.  Presumably Thanos returns a year later in Avengers 4 to try again.  Thing is, Marvel has promised that Avengers 4 will be "very different" rom Avengers: Infinity War and not just be Infinity War Part II.  If so then it is too early to speculate as to how Avengers: Infinity War ends.  Maybe it ends with Thanos getting killed off and Avengers 4 deals with the aftermath.  We'll see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you think of the Netflix MCU and do you think any of those characters are going to make the big screen transition?
 
KEVIN FEIGE: I think its extremely impressive what Netflix has done and it will be the same answer I always give, which is, It all depends on timing. It all depends on how to do it because I dont think what anybody wants to do is have such important characters show up for one second. Black Panther and Spider-Man to me are the high bar in Civil War of how you can bring in new characters into something. Vision and Ultron, Wanda and Pietro in Ultron. And it takes a lot of screentime, and it takes a lot of work. Infinity War has a lot of people in it already. So it just depends on how we could figure it out.

	<TEXT> Another issue is time.  I mean, there were already 12 heroes in Captain America: Civil War.  Introducing Luke Cage in addition to Spider-Man and Black Panther would have taken up a lot of screen time in what was ultimately a Captain America movie.  It would be easier, logistically, for movie characters to appear on TV or Netflix but whereas TV and Netflix actors DO have it in their contracts that they could be asked to appear in movies, the movie stars don't have it in their contract that they could be asked to appear on TV or Netflix.  That means separate deals have to be signed.  So far, Samuel Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Jamie Alexander have agreed to appear on Agents of SHIELD.  The fact that Marvel doesn't bring their characters back on the show suggests that they may be expensive. </TEXT>

Yet a May 2015 article from the Atlantic finds  from 2008 and 2013 statistics -- a significant drop of foreign second language usage from K-12 onwards. While 93% of high schools provided these classes, only 7% of college students continued language studies. Only 1% of American adults today, who studied languages in school, are proficient bilinguals.

	<TEXT> During the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. panel at New York Comic-Con, Marvel TV head Jeph Loeb responded to a question on the topic, simply saying, Fair question. The answer is: Stay tuned. In a roundtable interview with Screen Rant, Loeb additionally commented on the subject of an Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. crossover with the Netflix universe:

I get in trouble every single time I say this, which is #ItsAllConnected. But trust me when I say #ItsAllConnected and thats about all I can say on it at this time.

The Its All Connected hashtag became popularized thanks to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s tie-in episodes with the larger cinematic universe films, especially in the early seasons. However, S.H.I.E.L.D. has moved away from specific tie-in episodes, and recently opted to showcase the impacts of Captain America: Civil War through mentioning the Sokovia Accords and the events of the film. Elaborating on the difficulties of making sure everything in the MCU is connected and crafting crossovers, Loeb said:

One of the things thats a challenge and its unlike the movie studio because the movie studio is making all of the movies for one place and thats the theaters. The theater owners dont get to say well we dont want Spider-Man to be in Captain America  in that particular case Sony and Marvel had to work that out so that could happen. But in the case of what we do, we have networks to consider and thats a conversation [for] ABC and Netflix  and now we have shows at Hulu and Freeform and FX [as well]. So it just becomes a question of once it starts, what have we unleashed? But its certainly a topic of conversation.

	<TEXT> During the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. panel at New York Comic-Con, Marvel TV head Jeph Loeb responded to a question on the topic, simply saying, Fair question. The answer is: Stay tuned. In a roundtable interview with Screen Rant, Loeb additionally commented on the subject of an Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. crossover with the Netflix universe:

I get in trouble every single time I say this, which is #ItsAllConnected. But trust me when I say #ItsAllConnected and thats about all I can say on it at this time.

The Its All Connected hashtag became popularized thanks to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s tie-in episodes with the larger cinematic universe films, especially in the early seasons. However, S.H.I.E.L.D. has moved away from specific tie-in episodes, and recently opted to showcase the impacts of Captain America: Civil War through mentioning the Sokovia Accords and the events of the film. Elaborating on the difficulties of making sure everything in the MCU is connected and crafting crossovers, Loeb said:

One of the things thats a challenge and its unlike the movie studio because the movie studio is making all of the movies for one place and thats the theaters. The theater owners dont get to say well we dont want Spider-Man to be in Captain America  in that particular case Sony and Marvel had to work that out so that could happen. But in the case of what we do, we have networks to consider and thats a conversation [for] ABC and Netflix  and now we have shows at Hulu and Freeform and FX [as well]. So it just becomes a question of once it starts, what have we unleashed? But its certainly a topic of conversation.
