	<TEXT> This video made me think of an opinion that was last posted here 3 months ago so I'll just say it here.

Would it be for the better to separate the T from LGB?

If you actually go through the comments, there's little homophobia, it's more of a queer hate. 

I believe it's kind of a general opinion that the video could have gone smoother, society still has a not-so-easy time accepting homosexuality, and Youtube went fullforce depicting all of the sexual spectrum.

It just generated a backlash to have so many things in the same bag, and I'm left thinking that it WOULD have been better if it was just LGB for now. Would have been easily accepted, setting a positive precedent, especially due to recent events.

LGB was kinda close to being normalized for the western society but that video pushed all of the right buttons to reinforce hateful opinions of people who were unsure about what side they were standing in.

Besides, wouldn't their problems have different approaches?  Again, I don't really see people perceiving them all as the same, it's the T that stands out whenever something of this kind comes up. Talk about efficiency. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Needlesly is key. 

It's not an advance for mankind to recognize them, it's just precedent for people to start coming up with new pointless identities, it really helps more to just say them "No, just fill in male or female" and shut the door.

One would think that labels would help, but these are too much, it just attacks the common sense. That's why they got so many dislikes. </TEXT>

If they try that on the mainstream sites like Reddit or FB, normal people teaches them a hard lesson. 

But on Tumblr everyone rolls with it, I'd say that site attracts some special kind of public. Like, bloggers.

One day someone posted something weird, others saw it and started doing the same, and it ended up being pretty common there. Now it's a safespace for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trunks gave him a good enough fight, If this was just the beginning of DB Super I'd say the difference in powers is that of Mystic Gohan vs Buutenks. He's able to cancel some techniques and land some hits, but can't win in the end. Notice how Black cared enough to block attacks, he can't just stand there like Vegeta vs Gotenks tanking it all.

That would put him at Perfect Cell level, an enemy Trunks wouldn't defeat but he still can't be careless.

Buuuuuuuut this isn't the beginning of Super and we know Power levels are bigger than the universe right now. Black will be some universal level threat who was lowering his power level to enjoy the fight with Trunks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the first sagas one could handwave as it being a lighthearted series, with humor and stuff. Even Resurrection of F was mainly comedy.

But by this last episode I'm pretty sure we should have returned to the good old days. The tone is darker and they were acting as if a character was dying, but there wasn't a single red mark. 

I believe it would have made it so much better to just put some bloodied forehead or a thin stream from the mouth. The fighting now is really good but it could still use a better battle damage. Said character also coughed up some white liquid when kicked in the gut. It looks like American censorship but it's the original. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that was a dumb thing to do.

Still not clear as water that it should get him any sentence. 

I was just about to agree but then I remembered the amount of times I say to people that I will kick their asses, and many I know say the same. Also the rape thingy for discussions against females. 

That thing is really tricky, usually people talk that way on the internet so it's a dangerous tool to make it illegal. If anyone feels like it they would get you in problems.

I guess I'm leaning more towards the online harassment thing as everyone can join. Someone harasses you, you harass back. Both sides can do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I guess that's correct. I still think it's not set in stone that this is serious, because most people wouldn't really feel in danger by empty words. These "I will X" on the internet are just another form of insult, like saying "idiot".

But yeah maybe the wording matters, gotta be more indirect then. I can see someone getting a lucky shot and taking legal action against someone and the only defense would be "But I didn't really mean it", which doesn't really help. </TEXT>

Here, "I will punch/rape your skull if you don't upvote me". That may be considered a threat by someone but 99% of time it's just harmless, being said with no ulterior motives.

I really, really, tried my hardest making the world a better place and get me a princess, but my efforts were never recognized. 

I just needed someone on the opposite sex with my disney fantasies, but they all were more bro than me.

After watching the kind of fun (going out for drinks) girls have, and the way they talk when they get comfortable, I just snapped. 

I can't possibly act like a knight when girls are talking about how hot some dude is and how much fun they have going out at night.

Now I just have to act more "bro-ish" and everything plays out better, but I still hate it. It was a very strong opinion of mine, I even started fights with other dudes when I didn't like their behaviour... but there's no other way

	<TEXT> Those restrictions are moral bullshit.

Someone decided that sexual offenses were the worst and that's it.

Why isn't the same done to murderers and thieves? You know, if they really wanted safety, they wouldn't have a double standard. Those crimes are equally bad and if we know that a rapist lives nearby, we should also know if someone capable of killing or stealing us is.

But of course, I'd rather none of that. Even as accepting as I am, I'd just rather not know if I'm talking to a sexual offender, that's just uncomfortable, it's as if they didn't want them to reenter society </TEXT>

The government is already taking care of their punishment, no need to make the world hate them. Seems unnecessary.

There was a case decades ago where some kids killed a 3 yrs old and they were given new identities precisely to avoid endangering their lives. Why isn't this more common? </TEXT>

He is not a psychopath, this behaviour is very fucking common in all campuses, it's just a male thing to do. You see hot chick, you toss a mental coin (Will I get away touching her or not?) 

He just called it wrong

Brock Turner would hit a man if he saw him trying to touch a little girl. He didn't become evil incarnate or some shit, he's still a functioning member of society.

But people are trying their hardest to dehumanize him, like they do with Hitler.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> STOP DEHUMANIZING BROCK TURNER, HE COULD BE ANY OF YOU OR YOUR FRIENDS, HE WAS JUST SOME COLLEGE STUDENT [Massive Rant] </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, for those of you who want to know what's this all about, is that some guy named Brock Turner raped a girl on a campus party. That's  a pretty common story, one of the oldest on the book, but this one gained global attention on par with ISIS.

Going through lots of comments on Reddit, it's actually impossible to try and swim against the flow of hate. And I came to realize, this is exactly what was done to Hitler. 

I believe most level-headed people have realized by now, that dehumanizing Hitler, to the point that his name sounds like a random word and not a person's name, was a mistake.

General public seems to think they are not capable of great evil, because, hey, no one's evil. There was Hitler, but he isn't human is he? He's some twisted monster, born from darkness or something. It's not like he had a set of beliefs, a family, things he enjoyed and mundane activities like us. 

Or at least that's what people used to thought. Right now, I see everyone talking about how he was a normal human just like us, someone who could be our friend or annoying neighbor, a functioning man of society and not someone who just had a mental illness. Society has come to accept that at least murderers are normal people and whoever of us can be the next one if we take some wrong steps.

And that's a recurring theme I've found while researching rape in the past. People think they aren't capable of it, because that's something scary men with trenchcoats and hats do, following their prey through the night. 

Well, now Brock Turner had a "party accident", one of the most classic rape types, and ended up doing a girl behind a dumpster. What do we get?

Millions of people lashing out at the first set of news where it stated how good of a swimmer he was and how he was a college student. 

If you search his name on Reddit and look at the news, people already fucked up. They completely dismiss his family and friends trying to protect him and talk about how he is some kind of demon.

As if he had no thoughts, no motivations, no background, nothing. He's just the devil and rapes people, he's being equated to the worst of the worst already and there's people gloating about wanting to kill some 19 yrs old. Like jesus fucking christ, that's younger than me and I still feel like a child.

He did one of the most default rapes but people already sent that away to the Valhalla of crimes and now I'm sure that someone, somewhere, will do some kind of minor sexual assault but be reassured "Hey, at least I'm not Brock Turner, I'm not raping anyone behind a dumpster. This is fine, I'm not that monster"

All thanks to the hivemind who elevated him to some implausible status while he's just some college sports player. I believe empathy, not sympathy, was something necessary to understand this kind of behaviour and speak about it, not good ol' torches and pitchforks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought I was clear. Right now, his name is known worldwide, everyone hates Brock Turner.

I'm sure someone has the ability to give new identities to people for their safety, and I'm not sure if this guy can function in society as it is now. 

It would be the best way to end this storm. 

Since his face is the same he'd probably need to go to Europe or some other state where he isn't that known, tho.

	<TEXT> Why can't you people ease up like the judge? 
I'm talking seriously here. That happened and well, what a shame.

He's got a bad enough life already, like, I doubt anyone here is registered as a sex offender to even begin to know how hellish that is. You're just acting like kids throwing more stones at a dead bird for the hell of it. "Yeah he's bad so we can forget about humanity" We fucking got rid of death sentence because we aknowledged that wasn't a good thought process.

But there's no need to keep fucking with the poor guy for something which doesn't really matter on the big scheme of things. No one got killed nor was going to, no real collateral damage. It would have been better if no one stopped him, someone would take her to the hospital the next day and she wouldn't have gone through this. If all of the damage mostly came from it being published, then it wasn't a big crime to begin with. She would have stopped going to parties because of fear of that happening again, but that's it.

Where the hell is the empathy? I can put myself on his shoes but apparently no one else does. It makes my blood boil to see people cheering like animals on the worst fate someone can get, to be alive but excluded. Urges are weird like that and a party doesn't make it easier, of all the people cheering against him, some would have done the same if presented with the same opportunity.

There should surely be "tiers" or something, not all crime is equal. Even if both are sexual assault, some dude fingering a sleeping lady is not the same as some psycho with a hockey mask raping her while she's tied and screaming for her life on some abandoned cabin.

But what can I say, in America you even get to be registered as a sex offender for taking a piss on the forest. People don't really care about tiers.

I cut off all contact with my friend after realizing it was a lost cause, and after making her tell me to go fuck myself.

I did some things on purpose so that she was the one telling me to go away, that way it doesn't feel as if there was something else to do.
