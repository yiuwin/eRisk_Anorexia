	<TEXT> * They do worry about the market a bit, because they still have the scar of earthbound sales which they consider a failure. 
  
  
* Yes they have tons of English fan support from USA to Euro to everywhere else but Nintendo tends to ignore fans and stick to "What's best based on Company statistics and advisors"  
  
* The game would have to be edited a ton, based on the family oriented image Nintendo likes to keep here in the US. [Just look at the looooong list of changes they had to make for earthbound.](http://legendsoflocalization.com/earthbound/)   
If they were planning on ever releasing it to the US then Itoi would probably have had to write the story differently, and i'm pretty sure he would have been highly against that, being the last game n all...

  
There's so many more reasons; yeah Nintendo could just do it if they wanted to, but that's not the Nintendo style.
  
  
Sorry to sound like a Nintendo-hater, it is my favorite series of games ever. </TEXT>

-The rubber gromet at the bottom of the coil head is burned  

-The juice is not getting to your coil fast enough because it's getting clogged in the entry hole (too much wick)   

-coil is old and burned  

-not enough airflow?

-Juice is too thick(high vg)
