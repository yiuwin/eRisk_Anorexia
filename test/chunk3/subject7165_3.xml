What if my pimples start coming back. My old Facial cleanser did not do a good job of controlling it. Other products like Facial soap didn't do too well either </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I stopped using my Facial Cleanser around 4 months ago and I've been using rubbing alcohol which is 75% cheaper. I lost most of my pimples but arguably that could have been caused by other factors. It does a good job of cleaning my face but I'm not sure if there side effects or things that I should be aware of.
The rubbing alcohol I use is  70% solution. </TEXT>
