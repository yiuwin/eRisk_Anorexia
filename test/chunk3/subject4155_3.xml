	<TEXT> The best trick: at your age, do get lost in it go deeep. Then if its your job, hone it, work out what works etc. Don't just settle for sketches work out how to make it more (eg vectotise and put it on a blanket etc) animate it etc. Also if its just for you, all that getting lost in it will really help you zone out and meditate so you now have a new tool to keep you sane. Sorry quick phone typy... mucho commas </TEXT>
