	<TEXT> first of all, there is evidence. Why dose it have to be me in particular when there is a treasure trove of pics and other kinds of evidence. Lets put it this way if I found out the earth was round, nothing would happen. If I proved it was flat, boom! Nobel prize, set for life, and automatic fame. So if there was prof for the earth to be flat out there why has no one found it. Its simple because there is none. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WTF are you talking about? there are countless pictures and even footage of the moon landing, and the famous big blue marble picture was taken by an astronaut on the moon. oh wait I forgot any evidence that is ever brought to you fucks is automatically fake. Yet, while we provide pictures and footage of our claims for you to deny, you provide no evidence for any kind of denial or approval to take place. you say the earth is flat, I say pics or it didn't happen. </TEXT>
