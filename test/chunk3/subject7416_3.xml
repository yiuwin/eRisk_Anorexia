	<TEXT> It is hard to tell, but how often do children of celebrities/artists actually make a name for themselves? Like I guess Duncan Jones is seen as a serious filmmaker and not just the son of David Bowie, but like how many other people can you name that are succesfull in their own right outside of the connection to their parents? 

Also I guess Flying Lotus kinda count considering that he is the grand-nephew of Alice and John Coltrane.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Phil is clearly trying to build something bigger

Here is the thing though, it doesn't really matter, if people want to donate to his patreon than that is all that is important. Keemstar is in no position to tell people how they should spend their money, so even if people wanted to sponsor Phil so he could buy enough skittles to fill a pool, then that would be perfectly okay. Because if that is what people want to see, and they are willing to spend money to make that happen, then there is nothing wrong with that.

And besides I don't know if there is any evidence to suggest that Phil and other big youtubers using patreon is taking away money from smaller ones... and it is not like anyone on youtube are entitled to getting money through patreon anyway, so if Phil can offer people something through patreon that smaller youtubers can't, then why wouldn't he use it? And why wouldn't people support him?  </TEXT>

I don't think it is their fault if it would negatively affect me, but I do think if you're dealing with these types of issues or have in the past that it is important to be careful about it. Like I remember watching that one scene in Ex Machina and suddenly getting the urge to slit my wrist... so watching a entire show about these things might not be good for my mental health, although that is a flaw on my part, not something I can blame on the creators of the show.
