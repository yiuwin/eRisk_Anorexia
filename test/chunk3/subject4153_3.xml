	<TEXT> If this is how, I'd like to have more specific instructions. You can almost get there with Bordercities, but not quite....at least as I've experimented. 

I'd almost guess clever compositing of a couple different info views, but that seems laborious, and the way mods have been coming out it seems like it's entirely possible it's due to a mod I'm not aware of yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm planning some real-world cities and wondered if you could talk a little about your process? It seems a lot of folks like using real height maps but then design largely their own layouts on the real terrain, and don't try to recreate cities like you are and I'd like to do. Do you have a method for "transferring" the layout to the game? Or do you tend to eyeball a lot of it and wing it? 

I really wish their was a way to keep the 5x5 grid overlay at all times while playing. My first attempt at a real city, I laid out the streets one game tile at a time, using that one square as a reference for distances and placements...then I'd buy an adjacent game tile and repeat the process. It seems like the only way to try to reliably reference a real map. I've thought about laying in a grid in the game in some way...maybe like with electric poles at each tile's corner. If that makes sense.

But anyway, just wondered if you had some techniques that I may not have thought of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With this coming up, I decided to dive into the Morgantown map today. Needed a break from my others and thought Morgantown could end up being more interesting with the hills and river. I've done a lot of tweaking in Photoshop and finally got something I'm pretty happy with, good hilly terrain but not so craggy and rocky like the game tends to default to. And water certainly is tricky..yeesh, but got all the little streams closed off so the river and lake don't spill out across the map. I'm gonna try to lay down some interstates tonight.

Never thought there'd be dueling Morgantown maps! Very cool. When you get further along, I'd love to see what yours is looking like.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Side tangent, but I think the polluted trees are one step towards having a seasonal mod. With all the amazing things that have come out in just a week, I have to believe there's a fairly easy way to force "polluted_trees=on" during the fall. And the way there are mods to change the color of the pollution...maybe add an emitter to the trees the way pollution creates an "aura" and color it yellow and brown to look like fallen leaves.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, I didn't really expect to see Morgantown pop up in these forums any time soon. I grew up in Bridgeport and recently lived in Morgantown, both of them are on my list to make in game at some point. I messed around with the Bridgeport height map some this past weekend but it's going to take more work than I expected to clean them up and have them game-ready. At least as far as water is concerned, trying to get the smaller streams and creeks working right in Bridgeport is a pain, getting the Monongahela River right be a bit easier since it's so much wider. 

All the hills and tight areas, it would be a fun map to work on. And ha, yeah, hopefully soon there might be some sort of PRT solution...maybe just use pedestrian paths for now? Until elevated metro lines with custom cars are available.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Early on, I'd say it's just the writers playing around and not knowing what their own rules might be. To retro-justify it, I think you could argue that when 815 crashed and MiB had scanned some people to learn how to manipulate them he decided that the affect would be greater if he appeared to be the risen dead and not just a "ghost" or whatever. That Jack seeing his father and then finding the coffin empty would have more impact and break down his will easier. So he took the body and hid it...somewhere. Similarly with Eko...though he didn't fall for the ruse. 

I would've liked it if they'd try to establish harder rules and only allowed direct contact with people dictate who MiB could impersonate...but even before Isabella we had Kate's horse and Ben's mom who were fueled by scanned memories. So Isabella wasn't the first bending of the apparent rule. 

And as for the final seasons as Flocke, I guess time was more of the essence and either he didn't see it necessary, as "who would know of Jacob and the whole game and try to see through the subterfuge?", or he didn't have time to move Locke's corpse from the plane hull. Ilana and Bram knew, but we don't know exactly how much MiB knew of them and if they were a threat until the end of season five when it was already to late to stop him. And he did take the form of Alex, but that was in season five, before Jacob's death. I'm pretty sure that was confirmed(though not with any further explanation on the exact mechanics) by Damon or Carlton, probably on the podcast, as the point at which MiB is locked(hehe) into whatever form he has taken at that point. Mostly done I'm sure as a way to keep Terry O' Quinn employed all season and probably as a story point to keep the MiB from morphing constantly and having a lesser impact as an strongly identifiable villain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I switched over from Quill for a second and happened to catch his end as well. Sounds like the traffic was being the annoying thing and he said  "he didn't want to stream a game he wasn't good at", but it sounded like a large part of it was also that his YouTube announcement didn't get online in a timely manner and so he didn't have as many viewers as Quill. I mean, I get that this is the bread and butter for streamers and it's kinda like fighting for a finite amount of 'customers', but it came off to me as really whiny.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never have I anticipated and hunted out news as much as I did with Spore. And then closer it got to release and it was looking like every stage of the the game was a watered down version of that type of game and wouldn't at all stand up next to a properly committed game of that genre. Then the creature creator demo comes out and every animal basically feels the same, you couldn't really create a "broken"/clumsy/assymetric, truly unique feeling creature like had been shown in demos over the years. That's when I lost hope and was not surprised when the reviews were very lukewarm.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you wanna listen in the subway, put your favorite music on the phone's hard drive. But phone space isn't unlimited, and there's plenty of opportunities when I'm out and have a perfectly solid connection or walking around the house and the option for online music is wonderful to have. It's not *my* primary choice for listening, this is true, it springs to mind in only certain situations when I'm going to be away from the computer and I want to listen to something I deemed not quite worthy of going onto the phone's hard drive. 

I'm not as much of a huge music fan that I'd say I'd pay for a service like this, but the way Google's works, it's more of a "why wouldn't I do it?" kinda thing. And it's certainly not been a waste to have gone through the time and effort.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Tet Corp, for sure. I'd love to hear more about that side of things. Jericho Hill is a big part of his story, and after he'd set his mind on the Tower..but I don't know what it is exactly. It doesn't feel Tower-related exactly. Wizard and Glass could be called unrelated too probably, by my criteria, but it's still an interesting story. I guess I have a limit, maybe it's like the Star Wars prequels..yeah, there is history to the characters there and it's a big universe with hundreds or thousands of stories, but they don't necessarily *have* to be told and too much can "dilute the product".

Just going back to Wind Through the Keyhole as the perfect example, it's exactly what we're talking about..King revisiting the universe to tell us more of Roland's exploits. I liked it fine, but if you disconnect from it, it could've been about anyone from any story universe..it could've starred characters from Eyes of the Dragon just as easily as Roland and company. And so it just doesn't feel very significant to the Dark Tower EPIC story. I enjoyed the comic for a "lesser", quasi-fan fiction substitute...when it comes to novels, I guess I'm looking for a more discerning approach to the narrative and something more "important"..whatever that means exactly.

I don't know..maybe I sound silly, I'm feeling kinda dumb trying to describe it. I guess in a really over-exaggerated example, I don't want to read a story about Roland and friends picking fruit one summer JUST because it has Roland and friends in it. I'm, again personally, not that in love with the characters themselves versus the characters I might really enjoy just hanging out with in other books. I want it to feel like King has chosen only the few, best stories and not just throwing everything out there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never got into Stewart's run really. I know the politics of the era when Jon took over were huge and very newsworthy and couldn't be ignored, but I kinda liked how Kilborn's show was chock full of goofy, CBS Sunday Morning-esque bits and not so much the biggest, "real" stories told through a funny lens. Like, it couldn't necessarily be your snarky alternative to the nightly news, it was more focused on reporting the lighter side of the day that you'd watch in addition to the "actual news" at 6:30.

At least that's my recollection, there was probably more legitimate stories than I'm remembering in Kilborn's run and Stewart has probably had more absurd, random stories than I'm giving credit...but something about Kilborn, I guess I just liked his character more and that it felt more like early "Weekend Update". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I enjoyed it, it was actually the first King book I read though, I've wondered how well it would hold up if I went back to it after reading ~40 more.

It's kind of a reimagined, micro-scope, Bachman version of The Stand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh, I guess it depends on how careful you want to be. Personally, that seems a bit over cautious (And who has a specialized Sculpey oven in their house?). I do have a couple pans that I just use for the clay, but I've not been too concerned with cooking food in the oven later. Considering there's no warning on the official baking instructions, from the party that would be most concerned with avoiding lawsuits and what not, I'm not really worried.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Polymer clay is a great hobbyist, at-home sculpting medium..which isn't to really say it's lower quality or anything, plenty of professionals use it in some capacity. But what makes it awesome and used so much is instead of your typical clay that has to be fired in a kiln to cure, polymer clay can be cured in just your oven. And it also, unlike a lot of clay, isn't as brittle and is more plastic-like.

This is a really good sculpt, so much personality conveyed in there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not about feeling "threatened", I watch shows with narrative to enjoy an interesting story, and I'll look at attractive women on fluff shows or the internet if I want to see something attractive, I don't need my shows to be filled with eye candy(of either sex) for the sake of eye candy. I fin it silly and distracting. Emma Roberts is attractive, but the season wouldn't get a bump in the score for me if they found a lame reason to put her in a bikini. Unfortunately for me, AHS will probably never shake the need to have "boy toys" since a significant portion of the audience seems to love it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It always amazes me how jumbled 13 little ol' episodes end up being. It has the same clumsiness as a show trying to satisfyingly reconcile 9 seasons of crazy threads. I've thought before it seems each episode until the final one or two are written by different writers in a bubble, without ever seeing the other scripts or having ever sat together and discussed an overall outline of the season. Compared to shows like True Detective or Fargo that have such a strong, lean, consistent narrative and tone and vision...ya know, those things that the anthology format is supposed to be great about? Not having to deal with the baggage of meandering storylines and forgotten characters and story missteps.

I thought after season 3's pointless bits and all the criticism that followed, this season would be tighter, but not exactly.  </TEXT>

A thankful tweet, great.

An overly long on-air fawn-session for a character who'd been previously presented as kinda delusional and not actually tv worthy, ending in a silly happy afterlife after she was arguably largely responsible for the death of nearly everyone, not as great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I worded things poorly. I understand that no one was going to be executed or arrested if they left a contract. Like I mentioned in another reply, it's how "considered not returning" sounds like such a slight decision and not something that could've seriously affected one of the biggest movie juggernauts of all time.

When I say "can't leave at their own discretion", I only meant, they couldn't just decide it on a whimsy and not face some serious consequences. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, yes, thank you for the insight. I wasn't assuming she would've been sent to the gulag if she'd broken her contract. But a large part of a contract's purpose is to "force people to work" to some degree and place a penalty on breaking it. Anymore, I fully expect a studio to come just shy of legalized slavery when it means protecting their bottom-line and preventing any hiccups on their productions. 

Whenever I say "locked into", I'm not confusing being under contract with slavery, it's the way "considered not returning" is phrased in such a casual way when I imagine that thought had executives wetting themselves.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ideally, you're right. But when the option is to sign a contract or **not** be in the adaptation of the biggest pop-culture thing you've ever known and willingly turn down a lottery win, that's pretty good leverage for the studio. 

That's a good point on the salaries. Though I wouldn't be shocked to hear of the studio trying to lock in the same price for all the movies. You could probably right a couple books on child stars being taken advantage of.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, that's what I mean, a contract where the studio could still dump them whenever, but the kids wouldn't ever be able to leave at *their* discretion.

But it was a pretty untested thing at the time, to try to tackle a series that long, and you're right that they may not have expected such big hits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm surprised this was ever a remote possibility and the kids weren't all locked into for however many movies they ended up making. Only leaving if the studio, like after the first couple movies, decided they weren't working and kicked them out. 

Edit: Ooooookay, yes, thanks to everyone on the slavery definitions. I was never picturing David Yates whipping a chain-gang of kids. I suppose my wording was a bit too strong. I'm aware contracts are not pacts with a god and breaking one instantly vaporizes the person on the spot. My comments were only from mild surprise from being in a movie world where nearly everything is about protecting your cash cows and less about being a decent person.  </TEXT>
