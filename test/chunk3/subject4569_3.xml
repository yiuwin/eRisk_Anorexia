	<TEXT> For tees, I like to go with solid colors, but that's a matter of taste. If you've got guns to show off, then roll the sleeves. I have pretty normal arms so I don't see any need to roll. 

Flat front shorts are the go-to for most people. They work perfectly fine with tees. I like my shorts at least two inches above the knee, but again, that's a matter of preference. I typically don't recommend anything to the knee or below because I think it tends to make you look shorter. </TEXT>
