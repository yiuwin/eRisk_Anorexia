	<TITLE> What's up with the development of this game? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I really love this game. I've even gotten keys for 4 of my friends to play it with me, although we havnt been able to play a full round once in 3 weeks because everytime we try something is horribly wrong with it. The 0.0.5 patch was messed up and then we came back to it 2 weeks later to the 0.0.6 patch being in even worse shape. Now I understand that it takes time to fix huge issues but I also cannot explain how frustrating it is when devs promise a day a update will be launched and a day that they will post a dev update to the entire game and then they miss their own deadline. Im talking more specific to the online mode btw. One of the devs kept saying an update would come on Sunday and then that just never happened. Why even bother telling us a day if you're gonnna miss it by a significant margin? Like theres 9 servers up and 20 ish players on all 9 of them. I know there used to be almost 20 servers and 100 ish players on total a couple weeks ago. They've pretty much destroyed their player base by taking so long with this patch. This game is so fun but I really think the development process is holding it back unfortunately. All i've wanted to do is play the game. </TEXT>

I think a lot of it is just missing that high pitched voice. Having almost the same pitched voices kinda ruins some things for me. To me it doesn't feel like a Blink-182 album. Now keep in mind i waited until 5 full listens of the album and 3 days of reflecting to come to that conclusion. I just wish I was a fan of Blink-182 back when they released neighborhoods and DED.  I just recently became a fan a couple of months ago. </TEXT>

Most people are saying "oh but they're just being different" and "oh you need to get used to the evolution of the activity" but like where is the line at which we start saying "okay this is too much". It's like at the point where a big corps could come out and march woodwinds and I wouldn't be surprised to see it become almost welcomed with open arms. As cool as some of this stuff is I would personally like to see drum corps stay at least to its roots in some way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Patch notes for the 0.0.6 online multiplayer beta

The list of modifications and fixes made in the 0.0.6 online multiplayer beta are:

* added an in-game scoreboard screen (accessed with 'back' on controllers or 'tab'on keyboards)

* added support for Steam account name labels and Steam Avatar image labels (shown over character heads on stage load and invoked with the input mapped for overlay)

* added character name bars showing Stream Avatar and Steam account name for each player (accessed with 'left trigger' or 'L2' on controllers or 'caps lock' on keyboards)

* modified character selection screen to an earlier stage of the server connection sequence

* modified win logic for default game mode (winning scenarios is currently set to 3 wins to test stage cycling)

* removed vote kick (to test online gameplay sessions without support for vote kicking)

* temporarily modified the character selection screen to only support a single player slot (until online play modes with multiple players on the same system is supported)

* temporarily removed round and stage winner UI information (we currently expect to restore this in the next build)

* temporarily removed support for accessing the input mapping screen from the in-game 
pause menu

* temporarily removed support for joining a friends game

* temporarily removed the beta messaging (we currently expect to modify the beta message to include more information in the next build)

The current issues limitations with the 0.0.6 online beta build are (see the patch notes for full information):

* limited controller support for in-game pause menu

* limited support for modifying graphics settings

* no beta warnings

* no UI or interstitial screen for round win and stage win information

* no support for joining a friends game


[UPDATE 1] Information on issues in the 0.0.6 network refactor build

We have extensively tested fixes for issues introduced with the 0.0.6 network refactor build and have identified the key issue as client stages loading out of sequence with the current server stage (specficially the game is mapping collider geometry for a specific stage with scene geometry for a different stage making characters render inside scene geometry and removing kill volumes to inaccessible positions); in testing this exclusively occurs when a slower connection fails to fully synchronise with the server (before the session starts).

We are writing stricter tests to force servers to wait for pending clients to synchronise data before the pending session can start. We are also working on interstitial screens / load screens to mask character spawning / despawning and scene loading to explicitly identify that the current session is starting.

We need to make more tests but will publish the 0.0.7 online beta build with stricter synchronization processes and some other improvements as soon as it can be made public.

*Also to further add to this, the developers went through almost all the comments and responded to questions and concerns talking about how they would post a big huge post about their future plans with implementing online with the full game and all the maps. They also said they are hoping to get the next build with all these big fixes and synchronization fixes out very soon seeing as the game is currently almost unplayable.*

	<TEXT> That was a lie. Or at least not what the reason was for not porting it to PC. All the development for games are done on Development Consoles which are essentially PC's put into a case somewhat resembling the final look of the console. So they were already playing it on PC before. I read that the main reason people hated working on the game or why it was so stressful was because of the deadlines and working conditions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To give backstory to people who don't know. /u/idrinkliquidpoop posted some really interesting screenshots of a very detailed canyon scene.(someone saved them but I didnt). He then gave info about the game and also saying that he was told to take down the links and that the game was coming but not anytime soon. And then he deleted all his comments. It appears as if hes done this with other games. This is either a super elaborate ruse 
or hes being legit. He doesn't gain much by doing this.


EDIT: when I called him out on one of his photos looking suspicious. He responded with this comment. Which has since been deleted http://imgur.com/fIRyFlR </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It should be noted that that exact logo is the Rockstar North logo. Here's all the games they have made http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Rockstar_North

Also if we wanna get super out there. That color looks like a super dark blue. Not the normal rockstar north logo. Rockstar San diego (who did the main work with red dead redemption in association with rockstar north) has the purple logo. Now the logo posted here looks like a mix of purple and blue does it not? Not saying it means anything. Just saying its weird. </TEXT>

He's been playing very well and too many people look at the stats of a goalkeeper that deals with a leaky defense and come to conclusions. Just be happy about whose on the list. They'll represent mls well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ill just repost what I said in the /r/Rockstar post to here:

This theory makes sense, its just so hard to tell for sure with the way they are formatting. Although it does seem strange that the code was hidden soon after you pinged those 404 pages. Also all of this happening right before E3 where they are supposed to announce a new product. Seems very coincidental. I do think you are on to something.




EDIT: The remaster being the "11" game that you are talking about would make a lot of sense. I believe they wouldn't keep that one tied in with the newer format because it is technically an old game but just the remastered version of it. Therefore they wouldn't need to put it in the new game format, it would just need to be a different number than the older games. Game "112" would be the new game seeing as it is a completely new title and would need its own new formatting like GTA 5 had but it still kept the same first digit like GTA 5 did with the new formatting for example (GTA main titles are 21-25 and GTA 5 is 241). So it keeps the first digit for the new title but just changes/adds another digit afterwards. For red dead and the new speculated title here its (Red dead Redemption 1 and the new title looks to be 112) which means that it is keeping in line with the formatting to make it a new red dead title. Although I cant figure out why Red dead revolver which is in the red dead series, is marked "48" and not along with red dead redemption. </TEXT>
