	<TEXT> I do like the re-roll thing :)

Almost every "above 80% IV" Pokmon I have... has a bad (or non-optimal) moveset.

Jolteon with Thundershock/Discharge.
Vaporeon with Water Gun/Aqua Tail.
Machamp with Bullet Punch/Submission (This dude has been almost unusable in battle even with high CP.)
Jynx with Pound/Draining Kiss.

Fair enough, but I play very often, and yet I'm not one of those people because the spawns, stops, etc are not as plentiful in my area.

There are also people who don't even have the game yet, or who only officially got the game like a month ago.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really. In the games, it was just a number except for the order of which you went vs the opponent.

In PoGo, this has little to no relevance.

If the game was turn-based, it would make a difference. Of course Raichu would be faster than Rhydon.

But it's not turn-based. It's based on the speed and reaction time of the user.

I initially didn't like certain battle stuff too. But I don't think of it as one of the main RPGs so I understand there's a different play-style. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I play the game mainly to collect and complete my Pokdex.

I am currently at 122 caught and 138 seen.

If they release Gen 2, I will probably never find a Chansey, Porygon, etc. And even then, I just feel better finishing as much as I can before we go to Gen 2.

Also, apart from where the community is with finishing their Pokdexes, why would we receive Gen 2 before Gen 1 is completely released? We could honestly have an event for every remaining Pokmon. One for Articuno, one for Zapdos, one for Moltres, one for Mewtwo and one for Mew.

Why would Niantic not take advantage of that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thanksgiving event was good too but less exciting, mainly as there were no Pokemon that had increased encounter rates.

What about Ditto? :O

 Now, in my area I see a lot of Jynx so I am unsure of how rare it is.

I've never seen one in the wild. I got lucky and hatched one from an egg.

 I just feel like they have an opportunity here to breath new life into a game which is becoming stale

They've literally just had 2 very successful events and have showed us the promise of many more to come, that's APART from the fact that companies have signed up with them for sponsored events that we have yet to see.

I personally don't want Generation 2 before the end of this year. If they have everything happen at once during this holiday, people will see it as a massive distraction from family time, etc. I know I'll probably not be able to play much during Christmas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it's already been mentioned but maybe this format will suit your fancy. Just a rough comparison (all from my opinion) for you to get a grasp of Gen 2:

* Pretty decent comparisons

**Chikorita/Bayleef/Meganium** = Bulbasaur/Ivysaur/Venusaur

**Cyndaquil/Quilava/Typhlosion** = Charmander/Charmeleon/Charizard

**Totodile/Croconaw/Feraligatr** = Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise

**Sentret/Ferret** = Rattata/Raticate.

**Hoothoot/Noctowl** = Pidgey family.

**Spinarak/Ariados** and **Ledyba/Ledian** = Caterpie and Weedle families.

**Houndour/Houndoom** = Growlithe/Arcanine

**Raikou/Entei/Suicune** = Zapdos/Moltres/Articuno

**Larvitar/Pupitar/Tyranitar** = Dratini/Dragonair/Dragonite.

**Celebi** = Mew

**Ho-Oh** and **Lugia** = Mewtwo (These two are the end-game legendaries)

* Other really vague similarities:

**Smeargle** = Ditto (He can't transform like Ditto, but his signature move "Sketch" permanently copies an opponent's move.)

**Snubble/Granbull** = Meowth/Persian

**Stantler** = Tauros

**Miltank** = Snorlax (Expect this one to be a tank in gyms. An appropriate name, ey?)

* Then you probably noticed lots of related evolutions

Golbat - **Crobat**

**Pichu** - Pikachu

**Cleffa** - Clefairy

**Igglybuff** - Jigglypuff

Onix - **Steelix**

Scyther - **Scizor**

Seadra - **Kingdra** (This one will probably be a popular gym defender too)

Porygon - **Porygon2**

Chansey - **Blissey** (This will DEFINITELY be a top defender)

**Tyrogue** - Hitmonchan OR Hitmonlee OR **Hitmontop** (This will probably be the biggest family change in the game)

**Smoochum** - Jynx

**Elekid** - Electabuzz

**Magby** - Magmar

Gloom - **Bellossom** (This is an alternate to Vileplume in the original games, but will probably be a 50% chance in PoGo)

Poliwhirl - **Politoed** (Same as above and the ones below)

Eevee - **Espeon**

Eevee - **Umbreon**

Slowpoke - **Slowking**

* And finally...

**Unown** - This is a unique sorta-legendary Pokmon with almost NO use in battle but that had a fair amount of attention in Gen 2... because there's 26 variants of it. One for every letter of the alphabet (2 new ones were also added later, but that'll probably come in later in PoGo too). I'm really excited to see what they do with this one. </TEXT>

I think we have similar biomes then. 

 I'm up the creek without a paddle for most water/ grass types

I haven't seen a Seel or Shellder in the wild yet, if that makes you feel better. I travel a fair bit and if I have time, I stop on my way home to look around local supermarket parking lots, etc. I find parking lots at shopping centers to be goldmines sometimes.

 Also my biome was weird during the Halloween event

Same! Maybe it's that biome. I only found Cubones in my biome for almost that entire event. However, at my old workplace where I usually found Clefairy, Zubat and a few water spawns, I almost exclusively found Ghost-types.

I also only found Ditto after the Thanksgiving event so I don't just have fantastic luck, if that's what you're wondering. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jeez. I've had a massive amount of fun playing this game and I love it. I honestly think I could continue playing this for at least a year longer. I live in South Africa and, in my area, I don't get constant spawns or Pokstops but I've made it work. There's even people who are 100x worse off than me but they still love the game. Yes, I'd like it to be a bit more balanced, but that's about it.

 the cities and places that only get about 50%-75% of the available Pokemon 

No such thing. There's a small chance of anything spawning. But other than that, the point is to explore and visit different areas. If you're not doing that, you're not playing the game correctly. Trust me, it makes a huge difference in what you find. Where I live, I mostly find Rock, Ground, Fire and Fighting types.

 Why would I continue playing when I know my area never spawns wild Snorlaxs?

I have only ONCE ever seen a Snorlax and I've played from day one. But I used every trick I knew and had no trouble catching it. It was a great achievement to me and if I found a Snorlax every day after that, it would be almost boring. I'm glad some Pokmon are rare.

 How of Earth can people justify being excited for new Pokemon when the current gameplay feels like ass???

You sound like you're angry and frustrated about the game for various reasons. Can I ask where (roughly) you live and in what kind of environment? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly, I never said you could choose. I said you could possibly have a chance of hatching either one.

Nothing in Pokmon Go has really given us choices. It's usually been random. Even the Eevee evolutions.

And secondly, if I could choose, I would definitely pick Elekid, Magby etc because I have the basic evolutions already. </TEXT>

i.e. Pichu hatches from 2km eggs instead of Pikachu. Elekid, Magby etc hatch from 10km eggs instead of Electabuzz, Magmar, etc.

Or, you get a chance to hatch either the baby or the basic evolution form. </TEXT>

When I use Chrome on my phone, you have to sort of forcefully drag down to reload a page and I've never accidentally done that before.

However as you said in the post above, it's pretty easy to accidentally close the menu in PoGo.

I think they need to make it a bit harder to pull down. That's all. Then if you actually mean to do it, it'll work fine. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How would Shiny spawns work? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the vast majority of PoGo, spawns are the same for everyone and the stats of that Pokmon are apparently the same for anyone of the same level.

Does anyone think Shinies will work this way?

If I find a shiny Lapras, would it be a Shiny for everyone? Perhaps only a shiny for people on my level? Or would it be completely unique to my find?

If it is the latter, that more than likely means that the shiny flag will only be triggered when you click on it and it would look normal on the map. Bleh. That means any Pokmon could potentially be a shiny without you knowing.

What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> :) Well, of course. But my goal in the game is to collect first, maintain second and battle last.

So the Stardust etc didn't seem worth it at the time when everyone else was saying "lol i got my 53rd ditto!"

... But you're totally right. I got a lot of Stardust and XP from the event and I take my complaint back now. </TEXT>

Then, after the event ended, I had to spend time avoiding encounters and only swiping stops. I randomly used ONE Pokball to catch a Zubat at home and I found Ditto. </TEXT>

It's good to hear this and maybe that means Niantic is improving a lot more than people think.

I think they hit a good few bumps when they released PoGo, but I have no doubt that they'll get into some kind of awesome rhythm or something now. They've been releasing lots of updates and events so I think we can expect good things. </TEXT>

I do hope we get more though :)

Ditto was awesome, even though I only got it after the event ended and I was just casually catching a Zubat to get my streak for the day. (Wasted all my supplies during the event for nothing.)

Can't wait to see how they bring in the next big thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's what always happens to me.

(I live in South Africa, so we drive on the left side of the road - in case anyone is confused by my example below)


So, usually, there's a fair amount of traffic everywhere. Now, if I'm turning right and someone's also turning right in front of me, I want to get ready to shoot across behind that car so as to avoid the traffic in the oncoming lane.

Now what happens way too often, is that this asshole suddenly makes a U-turn instead of turning right and because I'm expecting him/her to continue driving, I usually get a small shock and have to brake hard to avoid hitting them.

If there's a left indicator, a right indicator and a U-turn indicator, I'd never be in that situation.

Also, someone recently mentioned a bar showing HOW hard the person in front of you is braking as opposed to just light on or off.

I just thought this would be another thing that isn't necessary but would be helpful to those that use / want to understand it.

In fact, I'll put this in the main post. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally think that it won't really be changed much and therefore Wobbuffet and others like Shedinja (one of my favourite Pokmon because of its special situation) will suck and will never be used in actual battles.

IF they do change things, they will probably reroll moves for all new Pokmon and legacy moves will be a thing again.

I'd imagine they'll introduce status effects and abilities. They'll probably eventually extend this to out-of-battle abilities like Pickup.

I hope that's where they're headed, but to be honest, I don't think anything like that would happen anytime soon. </TEXT>
