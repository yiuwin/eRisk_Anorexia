	<TEXT> Thank you. I don't know what to take. My hormone test turned out perfect, but I have a lot of sintoms of hormonal disorder: acne, facial hair, overweight... I started taking Myo Inositol and I'm starting D Chyro Inositol this week. I'm also taking Vitamin D3 and Spearmint Capsules, I was thinking to add some suplements, but I don't know which one can help my condition. The only thing my blood panel showed was high triglycerids. The rest was ok. (I'm on keto) Do you have a recommendation for me maybe...? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bioderma micellar wter is new, I've always used Avene micellar wter, but the derm recommended me this one for oily skin. I bought the pink powder after I started breaking out and I apply it just on the spots. It seems to dry them but I'm not sure, I'm kind of overwhelmed with what to do with the actual spots. In fact, after I started breaking out I bought a bunch of things for the acne itself, but I cut them all when I saw everything made them worst. I was using and a point: 

*Paula's Choice BHA 2%
*Paula's choice gel cleanser (I don't remember the exact name, sorry)
*Tea tree oil
*Epiduo
*Topical antibiotics (called Eridosis)
*Neostrata AHa 15 salicylic acid
*Cosrx Power liquid

And a bunch more of stuff that I don't remember (I'm at work now)
Now, I'm just using what I wrote before, the Heliocare and Avene cleanser I've used them for years, it can't be that...

Regarding food, the only dairy I consume is cheese, if is that, I'm actually eating a lot of cheese since I started keto, other tan that, no sugar at all, not dairy, not creams...

Could you send me a link to your pictures, I click in your name and it leads me to a place with all your posts, but I don't know how to make a search. :/ 

I'm not sure what they are, they are big and deep, the main place where I break out is my cheeks, over and over in the same spots. They heal very very slow. I think is cystic acne, but I'm not sure, Could you tell me what it is if I post a picture?

Edit: I'm not using make up now. After I broke out I read about the pilow case changing, and I'm doing it every other day. Brushes, I need to clean them, but I'm not using them at all...

	<TEXT> I didn't patch test at all :/ I received the products and I used them all together for a week or a bit longer. I even used samples in between... Then I posted something about me breaking out and a redditor from SCA or AB told me about test patching and advised me to cut every product and stick to my old cleanser and sunscreen until I cleared up. I've been two weeks using just Bioderma Sebium micellar water, Avene gel cleanser and Heliocare sunscreen and Mizon pink powder on the spots. Some days they seem to heal, but then, I have a new horrible pimple. That's why I'm thinking maybe is not the routine, because I also changed my diet at the same time and didn't think that keto could be what was causing it... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I,ve been on keto since april. A few weeks later I changed my skincare routine and 10 days later I had an acne break out. Every day since that my acne has get worse. I asked the doctor for a blood test and only thong different was high triglycerids. I went to the dermatologist and he prescribed me Epiduo but my pimples keep popping up and now I,m not using anything that can do that to my skin. So I have no clue about what can cause it. I,m starting thinking maybe my skin doesn,t like this WOE... ( Otherwise I feel great with keto) I just thought I may ask to see if some of you have experience something similar and/or have a piece of advise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well... I don't see exactly a pattern, Ive notice that:

*The battery doesn't last more than an hour despite I've bought two new Samsung original batteries over the course of 2 years.
*When I connect it to the charger the alarm screen pops up and freezes (I have to unplug it or turn it off for it to stop doing that, it drives me crazy).
*When I lock the screen a google chrome page appears on the screen (I've cleaned the cookies and internet history a thousand times).
*It has an strange square in the middle of the main screen with a partial view of my gmail. It's impossible to remove it.

It does a few more things...

I have been on medication for a long time (I was very depressed for a while).I,m not taking meds now (appart from a mild sleeping pill once a week or so) so I hope it,s ok, but I,m really concerned about the keto. I keep reading is very good for health improvement, but if I,m honest, I wonder if maybe for me is right (specially after seeing my blood panel). I,m afraid of going back to carbs and low fat, I was vegetarian for a while and I felt tired all day long and I kept gaining weight. So, I,m kind of waiting for my next blood test to see... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello,

I'm a 31yo woman with high cholesterol. I've been on a keto diet for 5 months now and I got my test results two weeks ago, it showed high triglycerids and low hdl. I'm thinking about using niacin from what I've read here, but I'm worried about "the flush", maybe my concerns are silly, but I have a couple of questions:

Can someone be allergic to niacin?
Could the flush make damages to the skin?
Is it inconfortable? / Could the effect be too long?
Could you recommend me a brand of niacin? (I live in Europe and I was thinking about Solgar, but if you now an European trusted brand that is not that expensive I would be thankful)

	<TEXT> Hello everyone,

I need help to find an ejuice that I can vape all day long. Until last month I was vaping a lot of sweet e-juices, vainilla custard type, or caramel, chocolate, milkshakes, miky ones in general. I had a reaction to one liquid and know everything tastes too sweet and I can;t vape almost anything (I;m currently with Snake Oil, but I don;t like it very much). I don;t like tobacco flavour neither mentol, so now I;m lost. I live in Europe, so if you know brands that are sold here it;ll be perfect, but as long as I can find them online it works for me.

Thank you very much.

	<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I'm so sad. About two months ago I introduced some korean and american products to help with my skin, which was oily and lacked glow and with severe PIH that really worried me. Firsts two weeks my skin was trully better, I was so shocked with the change, it was soft and hidrated and looked so even. Then, I started breaking out badly. I realized it was my fault because I had introduced everything at the same time. Then I reduced it to 4 products but still a lot of CC's and whiteheads and redness. I thought it was the oil balm cleanser at that point. I removed it from my routine.

Well, now, I'm so depressed and worried because I'm afraid of everything. My question really is, how do I reset? I have active acne, a lot of scars and PIH, everything itches... Like, what do I do? 

(I've seen the dermatologist and he prescribed me a sunscreen and a cleanser that I used alone for a while, my face started to dry out like crazy and didn't get better neither...)

I really need to know how to reset my skin...

	<TEXT> ello!

I've bought the Biore Watery Essence not long ago, my first asian sunscreen, and I'm so happy with it. I live in a very hot humid weather and I a swim, and I've read that Biore isn't water or sweat proof. So I'm looking for a everyday one and one waterproof-sports. 
I have oily acne prone skin and it took me so long to find a sunscreen that really suits me. I've research in reddit, and I see many options, but I'm so confused about what can I choose. 

I would like that it feels kind of like Biore, essence or gel type, not white cast, not thick. If it has a mate finish will be perfect too. 

Do you have any advise? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah hehe, yes of course. I got:

* **Petitfee Gold   EGF Eye Spot Patch (90 units)**  - I've tried before and really love them, I have sensitive eyes and dark circles, and they feel nice and seem to improve fine lines.
* **Petitfee Black Pearl   Gold Eye Patch (60 units)** - I bought this for my father because he tried one of my Gold EGF and love them, and I wanted to have the other version to try them both, but I haven't bought them before.
* **Innisfree Orchid Gel Cream** First time. I wanted a fresh not sticky gel cream for day-time. I have oily skin but somehow dehydrated, and last time I bought Snail Bee High Content Steam Cream (Benton) and I really like it but it feels kind of thick under the sunscreen so I use it at night. So, I'm going to try this. It smells great!
* **Tonymoly The Fresh Phytoncide Pore Gel Cream** I tried this one before from some samples and really love it, I bought it for day-time too in case the Inissfree one don't work for me, as I know my skin likes this one.
* **It's skin Collagen Voluming Toner** This one is for my mum, she already has the essence and another product that I don't remember from this line and she really loves the smell and texture, so she asked me for the toner as her actual one is finishing (The FACE Shop Clean Face Blemish Zero Clarifying Toner that really, is one of the best toners I've seen, but I use Klairs Supple preparation facial toner because I'm sensitive and this one, I know I have no problems with it).
* **Cosrx BHA Blackpower Liquid** - I tried in samples and really like it. I,m just going to use it in my nose area mostly. Maybe try it later in all my face, but now I have another non asian BHA that I have to finish.
* **Missha Artistool Concealer Brush** I just bought this one because in my last order I bought the Skinfood concealer and my brush (Bobby Brown one) is old. I hope it works fine!


Samples (last time they forget to include my samples and I told them, so this time they included a lot of them from both orders):

* **Goodal sample kit (toner, gel and eye cream)**. I gave it to my mum because I use the Goodal Moisture Barrier Cream since I discovered it, I have the craziest most sensitive eyes and this cream has been a game changer for me, before it I tried like 20 kinds and either made me cry or completely dried my under eyes (Except from Talika Detox, which is kind of expensive for me, but works well) still I prefer Goodal and my dark circles have improved a lot. I'll buy it again over and over :)
* **Holika Holika Skin  Good Cera Ultra Emulsion** - I haven't tried it, but I've wanted to try a Ceramides cream for a while and see how this one goes (I was thinking about Rossette from Japan, I've read some good reviews).
* **TEa Tree sheet mask, Etude House** Never tried it, in fact I'm kind of scare about TEa TRee things, they've broke me out before, so I think I'll give it to someone.
* **Lioele Blooming Shimmer Pearl Base, Illuminating primer** - I have never heard about it, will tell another time :)
* **Lioele Beyond The Solution BB cream** I have never heard about it, will tell another time :)
* **Etude House Fresh Cherry Tint** I've tried from a sample before, is nice, I don't use to wear lip glosses, I think is the red colour again, is beautiful, not very red.
* **It's skin Mangowhite Cleansing cream** I'm going to try it some time soon, I'm scared because cleansing creams use to break me out so I'll check the ingredients first.
* A lot of Tonymoly samples of foam and gel creams and the Black Snail Toner (I don't remember the brand) that I gave to my mum so I don't have them here...
* **Jolse Blotting paper** I'm keeping it in my purse. My face is shinny after a few hours and I use Innisfree no sebum powder that is great, I'll keep this in case.

And a hand a nails cream that I don't find the name anywhere in the package but it smells great and have like a vintage packaging so lovely :)
