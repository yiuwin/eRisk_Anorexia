	<TEXT> Actually, upstate NY was won by Al Gore, John Kerry, Obama twice... and then Trump. We're a Rust Belt area like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin or Ohio. 

Kirsten Gilibrand and Chuck Schumer would also have won their last elections without downstate NY. The major differences (lately) are that Rob Astorino would have won election in 2014. That's about it. 

We are a D-leaning swing area.

	<TEXT> because now we all agree that slavery is morally abhorrent and unconstitutional.

The fact that many people agree with something does not mean they are correct. If the opinion of the majority of people is how you classify "the right side of history", you acknowledge no morality except democracy.

Furthermore, "your opinions will not be shared by people in the future" is no reason to stop holding opinions. If anything, it is all the more reason to fight for them.

The central belief of Progressivism, in the paranormal force of Progress and history's direction towards undefined "Progress", is an absurd religious belief. That is the origin of the "right side of history" memes - the silly belief that history always moves toward Progress and thus everyone except Progressives will be shown wrong in the future.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure where that idiotic idea comes from, but that's not even remotely why we have the Electoral College. It has nothing to do with "transporting votes by horseback". The point of the electoral college is to make sure every state has a fair say in who becomes president, rather than a few large states deciding it. 

Also, just because something is "old" does not mean it is bad. Democracy dates back to at least 300BC, but you seem to like it.

Believe it or not, we are not a democracy. We are a republic, incorporating elements of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. The Founders all thought democracy was a pretty terrible idea and needed to be restrained.

And democracy is a terrible, stupid idea. I trust the American people to make good decisions about as far as I can throw them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah... I work for a state senator, and it's a really big problem. Upstate has a totally different culture, environment, and political ideology than NYC. One great example is the Sanctuary State Bill. Pretty much all Republicans opposed it, but so did upstate Democrats: it was only NYC Democrats who supported it, and it still passed the Assembly. (And Gov. Cuomo referred to Albany, our capital, as a "small town" when he moved into the Governor's Mansion.) So many legislators from the city are completely out of touch with upstate. 

I'm hoping the Constitutional Convention ballot measure will pass this year (not sure if i't will be helped or hurt by there being no major elections) and we can do something about it. </TEXT>

In the legislative elections, properly speaking, the GOP won the popular vote in the House and the Senate (discounting California, where the election was between two Democrats). Texas, Florida and California do control the legislation for the most part.

But I specifically meant Trump, who is very much in the Orbnesque tradition of illiberal democracy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not by definition theistic belief,

You can classify Progressivism as atheistic, sure, but it's no less a religion. American Progressivism is a non-theistic branch of Christianity. While Progressivism does not inherently involve there being a deity, it certainly does have absurd paranormal beliefs, such as the idea that history has some direction, belief in the inevitability of Progress, and absurd ideals like equality and freedom for all.

I have read the Old testament, the new testament, the qu'ran, greek mythology and some Shruti

I'm sure you browsed a few pages, but your understanding of it is pathetic if so.

and I am always amused to learn that people believe those things were true, or have people from one religion state that the other religion is wrong, that is very amusing as well.

I'm always amused when Progressives believe that something "new" or "modern" is inherently better, or something "old" inherently worse. Or that democracy is a good system of government, that all people are equal, that history has a direction rather than being cyclical... etc.

Spoken like a true fundamentalist (-;

I'm curious to know what, exactly, I am a fundamentalist for. Common sense?

Though to be fair you are actually quite wrong as it is quite easy to preach an economical moderate position and a moderate leftist position and at the same time take a stand against stupid plan economics that is communism or the quite infantile unlivable economics of libertarianism.

It's like you didn't read anything I said. Unfortunately, it simply is impossible. Firstly, liberal economics based on Keynesian economics is fucking retarded and has led to all of our current economic woes. Secondly, the left moves ever leftward. Yesterday we had Bill Clinton, today we had Hillary Clinton, tomorrow we'll have... what? A socialist, like Bernie Sanders? Your "moderate" stance on the issues is just an attempt to seem reasonable and rational, while in reality you're only emulating the mean beliefs of the greatest number of fools alive. While a planned economy is retarded, the ever-progressing march of leftism will lead us down that road again. And there's nothing "infantile" about libertarian economics, only their opposition to the state is infantile.

The reality of the matter is that such a moderate stance of some collective measures and reasonable but not unlimited free market creates an optimal society.

Oh, how absurd. Were that true, the rape capital of the West would be a utopia. Europe would be thriving, rather than dying out due to low birth rates. Their economies would be soaring, when in reality they're crushed under the burden of immense debts and a dismal grey bureaucracy. 

Moreover, you fail to see your problem. Your beliefs are not moderate, because there is no such thing as moderate. Yesterday, they would have been radical. Tomorrow, they will be reactionary. You will be left behind in the dust, unless you continually move leftward (or perhaps rightward a tad once every few decades) in the attempt to remain "moderate". Moderation is the refuge of people too cowardly to take a stand on issues, too short-sighted to see they will be left behind, and often too ignorant to have any grasp on the issues regardless.

I really like this last paragraph, because it really betrays just how far gone you are.

It is also quite easy to, as a moderate, be for religious freedom,

Ah, so the free exercise of religion, right? Allowing people to follow their consciouses? 

but take a stance against fundamentalist religious backwardness 

Ah, it's "fundamentalist religious backwardness" to stick to your beliefs rather than going with the zeitgeist. (Perhaps the Zeitgeist is a better term for the god you Progressives worship.)

And why is it "fundamentalist religious backwardness"? Because it goes against *your* religious beliefs, Progressivism, which states that all humans are equal. 

as that is simply bigotry and backwardness hiding behind the excuse of 'religious freedom' 

Bigotry and backwardness: That's Progressive ecclesiatical language for "heresy". You know what "bigoted" means, right? It means "being intolerant of another person's beliefs." That's exactly what you are - intolerant of other's beliefs. You believe that the state should use its monopoly of violence to force a business to go against its own moral compass and bake a cake for people living in sin.

even though said religion does not prohibit baking cakes

Oh, this is by far the dumbest thing I've ever heard. There is no law against smoking crack, only possessing crack. The fact that you're not allowed to use crack is be inferred from the fact that you're not allowed to own it. Similarly, the fact that you shouldn't bake a god damn gay cake is inferred from the fact that homosexuality is a sexual disorder and is intrinsically sinful.

Do you think that a Progressive bakery should be forced to bake a cake that says "Straight Pride"? 

For that matter, do you think that religious people should not be allowed to apply for conscientious objector status? The Bible does not say not to kill in war ("Thou Shalt Not Kill" is better translated as "Thou Shalt Not Murder"), so surely they have no reason they should become conscientious objectors, right? According to your idiotic view, unless something is specifically stated in the Bible, Christians cannot believe it. 

And apparently everyone who doesn't want to bake a cake for fags is a Christian fundamentalist, in your bigoted worldview.

This is my final word. You're not an atheist. You're a Progressive. You are a Progressive in roughly the same way Pat Robertson is a Christian. You've proven that many times over. And despite claiming to believe in religious freedom, you in fact want to instate a Progressive theocracy where others must cater to your moral beliefs.

I'm glad you folks have come around to theocracy at last. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Such double standards are allowed with nazi's,

I like how you don't even pretend to be unbiased. Never discriminate, unless you dislike someone opinions.

Are you of the opinion that all stores are allowed to refuse Jewish people?

Yes. And blacks, gays, communists, Nazis, conservatives, liberals, etc. The government has no right to mandate who businesses can and cannot serve.

You think having to service cake to everyone is forcing a moral belief?

Yes. I believe gay marriage is a sham and I would never bake a cake for a gay "wedding" because I would be participating in that sham. 

You do realize that it is already the purpose of a pastry bakery to bake cakes?

That's wrong, actually. The purpose of a bakery is to *make money*. If they choose to refuse a customer and thus not make money, that's on them. 

And again refusing to bake cakes to others is not actually part of christianity, so nothing is forced at all.

Now that's fallacious reasoning. I'm not Christian, so I don't give a shit about whether it's "part of christianity" - it's still forcing them to bake a cake. Whatever happened to the right of free association?

Do you think churches should be forced to host gay weddings?

Oh please, the intent is obvious, people like you are just not honest enough to admit it. The wider net is just because, as incompetently as this was handled by the administration, they were just smart enough to know they would not get away with an order that was blatantly obvious discriminatory in nature.

You literally just copy   pasted this.

That list was 5 years old so it is hardly an immediate security reason

It was never updated, so clearly it's not outdated. Or did Obama fuck up and forget to update the list?

also that list was made to exclude people from a visa waiver, not to deny people entrance on principle.

So it's okay to deny people entrance a little bit, but not a lot. Nice logic there, pal.

But your explanation perfectly showcases the stupidity of this administration, if they assumed that would be enough of an excuse to stand the judicial test.

I like how all your arguments boil down to "HURR DURR STUPID RACIST!" Shows how good liberals are at arguing. 

Hence why it was defeated twice in court (-;

By the most liberal, and most overturned, court in the history of the USA...  And keep in mind, there are still higher courts to appeal to. You get that, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In an industrial society that is increasing in interdependence (and reciprocality), you are dependent on people catering to you.

Cool. So if a neo-nazi group asked Goldberg Bakery to bake them a cake, should Moishe Goldberg have to do so? 

Nobody is forcing you to be a baker, if you do not want to bake cakes you can always seek other employment in another sector.

Alternately, we could just let businesses judge for themselves and not force our own moral beliefs onto them. Forcing businesses to cater to people they don't want to is no better than shutting down bars on Sundays.

Oh please, the intent is obvious, people like you are just not honest enough to admit it. The wider net is just because, as incompetently as this was handled by the administration, they were just smart enough to know they would not get away with an order that was blatantly obvious discriminatory in nature.

Which is why the so-called "Muslim ban" actually bans less than 10% of Muslims worldwide, in addition to the Yazidis, Druze, Christians, Jews and other minorities in those countries. Sure thing. 

throwing the christian refugees under the bus

Except that religious minorities from those countries receive preference when applying for refugee status. D'oh! 

The amusing thing is that it is obvious it is just an excuse, given that the administration is incapable to provide an immediate security reason for it

Actually, the administration has mentioned many times the immediate security reason: those countries were listed as dangerous by the outgoing president and it seems prudent to issue a temporary moratorium of "refugees" from those countries.

hence it is a stupid panic reaction if one is seriously defending it without any irony as necessary. 

Durrr hurr it's stupid.  </TEXT>

Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which is from God. The authorities that exist have been appointed by God.

This immediately affected the liberated Soviet prisoners of war, *but also extended to all Soviet citizens, irrespective of their wishes*

Many of them were anti-communists who were gulag'd or killed as a result, because they were fleeing the USSR.

Furthermore, despite your claims that he was "legally obligated to do it":

On the other side of the exchange, the Soviet leadership found out that despite the demands set forth by Stalin, British intelligence was retaining a number of anti-Communist prisoners with the intention of reviving "anti-Soviet operations" under orders from Churchill.

Eisenhower had no qualms about sending anti-communists to their deaths. I suggest you actually read the damn book, though. One fun tidbit: 

In April, 1957, Norman Thomas, six-time candidate for President of the United States on the Socialist ticket, stated that the United States is making greater strides toward socialism under Eisenhower than even under Roosevelt." Thats really saying something!

There's a lot in the book, especially about how Eisenhower and George Marshall ensured Mao won the Chinese civil war and that Stalin would conquer as much as possible. </TEXT>

Sure, but you're not really an atheist. You believe in Progressivism.

the idea of a god existing is of course rather crazy

Have you ever actually read any theological books? Dawkins doesn't count. I'm sure you're like "dohohoh le magic sky fairy" and know absolutely nothing about religion despite demonizing it.

And moderate collective left leaning policies in combination with moderate right wing economic policies to result in a to some degree free, but soundly regulated market to prevent market failure, is the more reasonable way to govern a country.

This word "moderate" means absolutely fucking nothing. This gets me more than anything. What's moderate today was extreme yesterday and will be extreme tomorrow. There is no such thing as "moderate" in the grand scheme of things; it's just a weasel word idiots use to avoid taking a stand on issues.  </TEXT>

And why exactly is that not allowed? Your religion, Progressivism, would force everybody to cater to the needs of a small minority, so clearly you have no problem with a religion ruling a country. The problem you have is that it's not *your* religion doing the ruling.

 it is not really liberty when you cannot make different choices

I totally agree. So why should I have to bake the damn cake?

And thus has no need for stupid panic reactions like a muslim ban.

Yes, banning people from 7 terrorist-infested countries designated by President Obama is a stupid panic reaction. And it's only "rational and reasonable" to call it a "Muslim ban". Right, cheerio, mate. </TEXT>

2. In his biography, Nixon said that he initially thought it was a setup, because "only an amateur would break into a political HQ for information."

3. Nixon always said he was afraid of J. Edgar Hoover ruining his career, and "Deep Throat" was Mark Felt, a protege of Hoover's.

4. Nixon's tapes show that he was looking into "The Bay of Pigs thing", which is probably coded language meaning he was looking into Kennedy - specifically his assassination. (The CIA did that, too.)

The whole fiasco was set up to implicate Nixon. Of course, when he tried to cover it up, it got a whole lot better for them. </TEXT>
