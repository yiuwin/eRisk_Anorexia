	<TEXT> Hi all! I run a Youtube Channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdBVtFcCUvxHWvgoUmTLByg). It's a mixed channel, so I have Let's Plays (just started a SOMA one) bu I also have Disney related videos and topical vlogs. It kind of encompasses everything I love. But I put up at least 1 gaming video a week, if not more, so definitely check it out if that's up your alley. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's my gamertag. Not a super exciting story ha, but it made sense because i use the gamertag for everything, for all my social login names etc (like this one!). It just made sense to extend that to my Youtube channel and then people can easily find me on Steam, PS4, reddit, Twitch, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> also have the same problem. I get about 2 mornings a week where im ok. Otherwise, painful stomach aches that make me sweat and not able to stand straight. "feels like im in labor" is exactly how ive described it before too (not that id know, but its the best way to describe the pain intensity). It'll come in waves too, like ill go, 15 min later more pain, go again, 30 min later, more pain, go again...then im finally OK rest of the day. doesn't matter what i eat. ive tried every diet change imaginable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> my last trip was solo and i only went because of a ridiculous airfare deal i got. it was only 3 days and it ended up costing me about $600 for the trip with an extra $250 for food and souvenirs.  It was just slightly less than "satisfying", a 4th day would have been needed. So, i dont know.... $1200? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Therapy To Ease Anxiety   Obsessive Thoughts Over IBS? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-11 01:22:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Has anyone gone to therapy as part of their treatment for IBS? I've done the  full dr thing, and most meds havent helped me aside from a regular dosage of imodium when feeling ill. But the mental aspect of IBS is really affecting me. Every single day I wake up, i fear feeling ill. On my way to work I'm constantly worried about having an accident (i take public transportation, live in NYC), i am always thinking about nearest bathrooms. If my day is full of back to back meetings, i get worried. If I'm traveling, I get worried. I wonder if anyone has gone to therapy to try and curb the constant stress and anxiety and overthinking, and if it's helped you. I have gone to therapy before, many years ago, for a past eating disorder (that yes, i think may have attributed to my IBS unfortunately) so im no stranger to the idea, but little hesitant on spending the $$. want to hear other people's opinions. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Videos without Intros? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have an (ok) intro that's about 6 seconds long. I've uploaded a couple of videos without it recently to see if it helps with retention at all. Do any of you just forgo intros altogether? Have any of you experimented with having them on some videos and not on others? Do you find they help, are a hindrance, or neither? Curious about experiences!

EDIT: thanks everyone for feedback. it seems that intros aren't a necessary element and so i think im going to drop mine, especially because i don't love it so much anymore anyway. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> got home last night. it was AMAZING. my 12th trip, and my first alone, and quite possibly my best disney trip in YEARS. I DID ALL THE THINGS! I rode Rock n rollercoaster 4x in a row. I completed a night show trifecta of Fantasmic, Symphony in the Stars   Illuminations. I met Donald, Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Chip n Dale and Kylo Ren! I ate at the new Skipper's Canteen and shopped at Basin White in the Grand Floridian. I caught the Dapper Dans, Festival of Fantasy, Voices of Liberty, and so much more entertainment. I had a FREAKING BLAST!

I'm a youtuber and will eventually have vlogs up but also will do a video about tips for solo travel, which if no one minds I'll share whenever they happen (probably not for a bit, just trying to come down from the Disney high and get back to real life!). But it was wonderful. If you have any questions about traveling solo, please feel free to ask! and thanks to everyone here who encouraged me to do it :) </TEXT>

 wasn't  going to be able to build an audience on both. So I decided to start putting up vlogs and other content on my gaming channel. It's done really well for me.  People just come for the content they like and skip on the videos they don't like but either way it's worked out </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's kind of ridiculous. Every morning I wake up, and pass gas for about 20- 30 minutes. I feel it moving around in my stomach, uncomfortably so, and i passes loud and obnoxious (not always smelly, sometimes just forceful). Then i get to the last couple where it's like, ok no I need to go to the bathroom now. EVERY. MORNING. no matter what ive eaten the day before. I have days where i eat very little due to not feeling well and even after those days im gassy as heck. Is it a food thing, or is it a body doesn't know what to do with gas at night thing? I'm wondering if my body is passing any in my sleep, or if it's all just sitting in there until i wake up. and it's all usually a precursor to 2-3 BMs which i try to have before i have to leave for work, but obviously sometimes im late :-/ sometimes the BMs are manageable, sometimes painful and liquid like. but all times it starts with gas. so. much. gas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a fascinating question. I work for a digital agency, I'm in the social media department specifically. It makes me really analyze their marketing in a lot of different ways, but appreciate it more. I always say to my boyfriend "you may not like Disney World, but you have to admit the way they market themselves is on point!" he can never argue it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a former cast member, but not from the parks. I worked at the World of Disney on 5th Ave in NYC for 2 years, up until it closed. I worked there part time while going to college at Hunter (on the UES).

PROS:
Definitely the discounts. We were still considered the same as park CMs, WOD (as we liked to call it) was just a New York extension of the parks, and so we got all the perks of free entry, hotel discounts, comp tickets, etc. I went two times in one year, for my first time ever, due to the discounts.

The people I worked with (mostly). I made some really wonderful friends who, now 7 years after closing, I am still close with.

Being a part of a company I loved. Although the job is just retail, mostly (though there was characters   entertainment on the third floor), I still really loved being a part of Disney, having my CM badge, which I still have, and representing a place I grew up adoring.

Quiet days in the store meant goofing off and playing with the toys. Our managers were fine with it as long as guests who came in weren't neglected, and guests were pretty amused by us having pirate gun fights across the second floor.

Celebrities galore! Got to meet and see quite a few in that time (Matt Damon, Britney Spears, Melissa Joan Hart, David Beckham to name  a few).

CONS:
every christmas season, almost every day, guests would break the glass ornaments. Often it was by accident, sometimes it was parents not watching their kids, but you'd hear that ornament fall and we'd all go "OPAH!" It sucked if you were working that section though. Anxiety the whole day, and once something broke it was like "OMG KEEP GUESTS AWAY FROM THE GLASS UNTIL SOMEONE GETS YOU A BROOM!" hated it. Apply this also year-round to snow globes, but they were less often broken.

The other few co-workers. Some were just...not nice people, there for a job and not caring about being kind or friendly. I guess not being in the parks makes a difference and I get it, tourists on 5th avenue, rough as hell to deal with sometimes. But man...these people made me so angry. Why are you working at disney then?! just go work at another retail store where your grumpiness is welcome haha.

Did i mention tourists? Some were very grateful and kind, and some were just so...so rude. Most of the rude people were foreigners, not domestic tourists. 

Rich people of 5th avenue. You know, the ones that come in to buy like $2,000 worth of toys for their kids but complain about everything. Look, lady, I'm a born   raised New Yorker, and I ain't taking your crap! I use to be overly nice to them and it would irk them that they weren't getting under my skin.

Closing the store. It was such a sad, sad last day. Entertainment was gone first, about 6 months earlier, and we had to explain to upset kids and  sad parents that Cinderella went back to Orlando. We'd hear these stories of people not being able to afford trips to WDW so they would bring their kids to this store, and it was heart breaking to tell them the news, i never wanted to. Then the last day was sad, we shed a few tears, breaking down the whole store, our regular guests coming in and saying goodbye. Was really sad :(

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After all the celiac blood work, lactose, crohn's, colonoscopy work etc. somehow, no one though to really give me a full food allergy work up. Mostly because I had been tested as a kid, and never had any food allergies. Well, this is 15+ years later. I went into an allergist today, actually about some oral allergy issues, but she tested meat and i had a crazy bad reaction to beef, pork, and lamb. Guess what? All huge contributors to my IBS-D. It was like, eye opening. She wasn't even going to test for it originally because my oral allergies are coming from grains and oats, but she decided to do it anyway.

Now I am going for blood work to make sure none of the skin tests were a false positive, but this may be the key to me feeling better! Granted i do react from time to time to other foods but these are the biggest culprits...and it could just be an allergy!

Point is, get tested for foods, especially if it's been years. You might think you don't have an allergy...then find out you do. </TEXT>
