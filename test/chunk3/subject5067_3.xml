	<TEXT> How you move, how the armor looks like, what the bosses do, how much damage you do, what items are in game, just how the game literally looks like when you have the game opened and you look at it, where teleports take you, what you can do with certain skills, what skills there are, what gear you can wear and what types of xp boosts or whatever you can get. 


Just some of the stuff that came to my mind, im sure i left some out. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Ways to keep your account safe. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-24 14:02:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So i'd love if the people who know more than i do about this topic would make a list of things that really help me to keep my account safe.

Here's the stuff i've gathered thus far.

Never told anyone my previous emails, where the account was made, internet provider or how I've bought my memberships. Also I'm using 2 step verification on my email and on my account and i have a bank pin, also, when i log out (for long period of time, so not for 2 hours or smthng) i make sure to put everything into my bank. 

Negatives (just putting these out there in case someone does these, i personally don't really do any of these but yea, might help someone) 

Having any sort of gear that's valuable (or untradeable since if they can't get wealth from your account they might aswell drop your void) in your inv when you log out. 
Having any pets follow you, tbh im not sure what they can do if you've insured them but better safe than sorry and this just happened to come to mind.

Telling your password to anyone or using any client 
(now, personally, i use osbuddy, which i guess could be harmful but i've never seen proof of osbuddy not being secure and i honestly think that if you've known someone long enough you can tell if you can trust them and tell them your rs password or not.) This is up to you but i honestly think that telling your password to your mate who you've known long enough is not even close to being most popular reason for people getting scammed. 


Yea, thanks for reading and sorry for any typos etc. Please comment if you think i forgot anything/was wrong about anything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, no shit streamers get help?

This honestly irritates me so fucking much, if you're nobody who just casually plays and gets hacked and then banned for macroing how the fuck are you gonna prove that it was you? The streamers can't prove it either but no shit they get more atenttion if their whole viewer base comes over and makes jagex know the situation. 
Also why shouldn't this be the case, streamers need their accounts sometimes to literally make money for paying bills, you dont most likely need your account for anything more than entertainment, so you can most likely wait a bit longer. 

Wake the fuck up

Just want to add that yea, it's fucked up that the system doesnt work any better, that being said it has nothing to do with streamers.

	<TEXT> You can't compare them in any way shape or form. Simply because they're two different things, lets put it this way.

So i think scamming should be allowed in runescape.
One could argue that some of the reasons i think it should be allowed can be applied to real life, therefore i must think scamming irl shoud be allowed.

And this is where your logic gets fucked. 

Yes, if real life would be a game called runescape and all the same rules etc. Would apply, then yes. I do think scamming irl should also be allowed, under the EXACT same circumstances i think scamming should be allowed, however the same rules and stuff will never apply irl so i dont think scamming should be allowed.

If you still cant understand my point let me know and ill try to explain it even better. Also i apologise for every typo i had i kinda wrote this in a rush.

	<TEXT> first of all, i get triggered when people compare games to real life, they're not similiar at all in any shape or form just don't compare them. 


Interesting idea, tho, that if scams were made to involve a risk, that'd be cool to see. And yea i sort of agree with the dmm thing you said, makes sense. And after all this was just a thought experiment. Thanks for bringing up good points tho, just the discussion i wanted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wait before you downvote me to oblivion and atleast try to read it (or just downvote don't rly care if i get comments discussing)

So, i know this topic is somewhat controversial, but i just honestly want to know what people think. 

So, as the title says, should scamming be allowed? I honestly think that yes, it should. Why, you may ask. Well, simply because i think that someone smart enough to find a proper way of scamming that actually works on people should be able to benefit from it. 

I know the rule was made so new and inexperienced people wouldn't get scammed and quit, but could it work if the new players were made aware that scamming is allowed and if someone tells you that they will trim your armor you probably should not believe him and hand him your dragon items. (Yes dragon items are what new players wear shush ;P). I just feel like it could add a lot of depth into the game.. Is it just me or do any of you guys think so? Even remotely?

Also, i just want to add, that yes, i've been scammed and no, i've never scammed anyone. In case someone was thinking i'm mad because my main got banned for scamming or something. It's also not that i think the system's flawed atm for not allowing scamming, i just like to think things like this :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd play rs3 over osrs if it had the same feel and combat system etc. 

It really irritates me when people think adding new stuff to the game is bad and then stop the game from getting updates (such as sailing etc.) Not talking about having and opinion about one update and voting no, but when someone auto-votes no to everything just because it's new content there's something wrong. 

Also why the fuck do you consider something such as stamina pots bad? Why do you have to do every dumb shit that makes a game that already requires you to play for extremely long time even harder, such as waking from place to place for example  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for answers about urf. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-10 11:24:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't understand why riot doesn't want more people to enjoy playing their game. I just don't. The decision to not keep urf available at all times is extremely stupid no matter how you look at it, many of my friends already quit the game simply because its not fun but return to play urf, one for all and sometimes hexakill. 

It's not only urf either, i don't understand why riot puts time and effort into coming up with these awesome game modes and then take them away when they get famous. If someone is able to answer me/make a rioter notice this so they could answer me please do, i just don't see the logic. Riot could literally make it so you can buy another gamemode for 500rp or whatever and profit off of that (some might argue it would be douchy thing to do, but if you're still able to play urf whenever its on the rotating gamemode que who would it hurt if you'd choose to pay 500rp for example, and be able to play urf whenever you want.)

Also i want to add that imho the argument that 'its not ment to be permanent and this makes it so riot doesn't have to balance the champs' is just stupid. No reason to balance things or even think about them, if something's too good people will ban it. 

Just wanna add that even tho i mainly speak about urf the same applies for pretty much every gamemode. </TEXT>
