	<TEXT> I have seen the original. Bugatti made it in the 30's as a pusher. Someone  found out about the aircraft and bought the motor, so it had the drive train but no motor. The way it was laid out with fiberglass, one would be more reclined in the aircraft than in a Lamborghini. The Smithsonian owns it now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why does Philip Morris care? Addiction doesn't care. 

Look at the before and after meth pictures. If Philip Morris was selling meth and countries decided to put pictures
 of meth people on their containers, would it deter people from buying meth?

Who gives a shit. Let people do what they want to do. I just don't want someone else to become Queen of shaming me. I'm not fucking five. In a way it's propaganda. Im not saying meth or tabbaco is good...but fuck, smoke a sig through the hole in your neck.
