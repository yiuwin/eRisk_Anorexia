	<TEXT> Ohhh I see. Do you try fasting after a binge? Because for me at least, if I fast after eating a lot the day before, I get mad cravings and overall feel awful. But if I fast after a few days of restriction, I feel pretty okay and the fast is bearable.  </TEXT>

I frequent that sub on my main account and I often see a lot of posts about women with injuries looking for things they can do to maintain their physique and make some gains while injured. 

They are a great community and really make me wish I was on Reddit when a horse stepped on my knee 3 years ago .

	<TEXT> Honestly for me, caring for animals (well, my horse at least) makes me eat/nourish myself *more*. I have 2 cats but they do their own thing, so I don't have to care for them as extensively as I do with my horse. 

My horse is like my child. When I bought him, that's when I recovered from anorexia for the first time in my life. I was doing so much more just because I owned him. He had vet appointments, farrier appointments, chiropractic appointments, etc. AND I was riding like every day, since horse ownership means you can ride whenever you want. I also had to allot time to make his grain and other foods. Plus, grain bags aren't light. Lifting a 50 pound bag of grain is not easy when you're malnourished! And I was competing more since I had my own show horse.

I needed fuel to make sure I could do all of these things to take care of him. Like I said, he's like my baby. In my mind, I needed to be able to nourish myself to take care of my baby. My "baby" won't survive if *I'm* barely surviving. 

As you can see, since I'm an active member on this sub, I'm in a different place now. I'm relapsing. I still take care of my horse, but I pay for full service for him, meaning I don't have to do *as much* to take care of him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sick of school. There are 4 weeks until finals and I just can't anymore. I just want to wake up every morning, go ride my horse, come home and starve myself until I feel pretty enough. I don't want to have to use my brain anymore. Schools sucks the life out of me and it makes me hungry and cranky. Why can't I just stay home all day, drink coffee and watch my shows? 

I'm sick of doing my hair. I'm sick of wearing makeup. What's the point? None of that will make me pretty unless I'm skinny. 

I'm sick of my mom and her boyfriend. They came here on Thursday and left on Sunday and I ate so damn much. I fasted yesterday and I still feel fat and disgusting. The worst part is I'll be going to Washington DC with them Friday-Sunday, only to ruin this week's progress ALL OVER AGAIN and suffer next week. On the bright side, my flight is in the morning on Sunday so I'll only have to eat on Friday and Saturday. And Friday my flight arrives in the evening, meaning I can get away with just dinner. Also I have my own hotel room, so I can lie about if I ate that day and just eat if we are eating together.

My mom left all this delicious home cooked food for me and I just tossed it all in the freezer because I'm not going to eat it. I feel so bad. She spent hours cooking for me all for it to just go in the freezer and stay there...forever. 

I'm sick of this fucking eating disorder. I hate it. I wouldn't wish an ED upon my worst enemy. 

I'm sick of not allowing myself to see my friends, because friends = food. I miss my friends so much! I'm sick of people at my barn thinking I'm a stuck up bitch because I'm not "friendly". I am friendly! I'm just tired and starved so obviously I'm not going to be the most chipper of people. I was invited to a barn dinner at Olive Garden. I declined the invitation and now people are apparently saying "Oh, subject6956 thinks she's too good to have dinner with us." No. I'm just too eating disordered to go to a damn restaurant. 

I'm sick of my life and my eating disorder. I wish I could just be normal. I wish I didn't feel like crying when I see food. I wish I could ask for help, but I don't want help. I can't even vent to my friends or family because there's nothing they can do since I'm doing this to myself.

	<TEXT> I have a really overweight friend as well. She's close to my height so that's even more triggering, and almost makes it competitive? And it helps remind me "don't eat that or you'll look like [insert friend's name here]." My starting weight is nowhere near as heavy as she is - I've always been thinner than her. But part of me needs to be even thinner so no one would ever dare say we're similar in shape. Once she said "well we're both curvy". While that's true (I have an hourglass figure or whatever you want to call it, wide hips, tiny waist, womanly curves, etc.) there is a huge difference. I'm more skinny fat and she's just...fat. 

She says she's happy with her body, which is great. You know, I wish I was happy even being in a normal BMI range. But she's not trying to lose weight or anything so I do worry about her health due to her weight. We both ride horses, and she has dreams of being a Grand Prix rider, and I know she knows she can't do that given her current physique. The sad thing is she uses so much fat logic. She says "I have a lot of muscle so I'm happy with myself". While she is an athlete and that may be true, her BF% is definitely too high to be "all muscle". 

TL;DR: My overweight friend who is similar in height is motivation for me to keep fasting and restricting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of, yes. I posted in another thread how I'm fine eating a 200 calorie protein bar but if you put a huge 200 calorie salad in front of me, I would cry. I like small quantities, even if they are higher in calories. If I ate a large 200 calorie salad I wouldn't feel like I was restricting, and I would feel like I'm going to gain weight from it. Totally illogical but that's my ED brain :| </TEXT>

There is this obese girl from one of my classes a few semesters ago I'm friends with on Facebook who posted "A hamburger and head of lettuce both cost $3 - what's the obvious choice here?" Awkward because earlier that day I literally purchased a head of lettuce for $0.99. Besides that, canned and frozen veggies are so damn cheap and they don't spoil. Sure, they may not be as healthy as fresh produce, but they're still better than a fucking hamburger. </TEXT>

I totally feel you when you say you're scared to maintain. I have no intention of stopping restriction, but I know there will be a few times where I'll have to maintain/slow down my weight loss so people don't get alarmed or anything like that. I am yet to reach that point, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

	<TEXT> I'm coffee fasting today and I did my weekly food shopping a few hours ago. I purchased only my safe foods, and I felt...better than everyone else in a weird way. Like, I walked past that section of the supermarket with fresh fried chicken and the bakery where I could smell chocolate chip cookies. I (literally) held my head high and walked past it confidently even though I was fucking ravenous. And then to see everyone putting chips and cookies and pasta and soda and bacon in their carts, pushing my cart along with water, baby carrots, coffee, protein bars and sliced chicken. 

Am I a fucking sicko or do any of you feel this way, too? It's partially a sick game I play against myself - how starved can I be while resisting the tempting foods right in front of me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats! I know you may not be able to see it but I find that weight loss is super noticeable in other people, especially if I don't see them too often. So your weight loss is definitely there! I've lost 14 pounds and I still feel like I look the same, despite being able to see my ribs and hip bones a lot better - everything else looks the same :| But especially with us short girls, it's much more noticeable even when we lose even just 5 pounds.

I also really like your idea of 10 pound goals! I've been setting my goals at 15+ pounds and it can be discouraging. Like, even if I've lost weight, I think "damn I have soooo much weight to lose before getting to even my first goal weight". But at least with 10 pound goals, you can lose 4 pounds and say "Fuck yeah! Almost half way there!"

	<TEXT> Well before I relapsed and came back to this sub, I went on a health/fitness kick trying to lose weight the healthy way, eating 1000-1400 calories a day. I was miserable and calorie/macro counting became so triggering. But when I was doing that, I was going to the gym like 5 times a week or so (2 days on 1 day off) and lifting. I hate cardio but I looooove lifting. 

However, now that I'm restricting I just don't have the energy to do that anymore. I'm thinking if I start following my old food diary thingy, I may have the energy to work out again. Even though I hate cardio, I think I'd do that at the least if I started eating a bit more. I'm injury prone. I actually have nerve damage in my elbow from being bucked off my horse twice in the last week, so I can't imagine that lifting would be safe on such a high deficit. 

Other than exercising, I find that just simply being busy keeps you active. Running errands for a few hours every day is way better than sitting at home, in bed, spending hours on Reddit and watching TV. I have a 1 hour 45 minute break every day between classes so I'm thinking of spending that time just walking all around campus aimlessly to burn a few extra calories every day.  </TEXT>

However, I want to be a lot less than 105 so my goal is 92, which was my lowest ED weight ever. I have a few goal weights. My first goal weight is 110 then after that my goals are down in 5 pound increments until I get to 92. However, knowing me, I'll probably want to keep losing even after I reach 92.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a lot more active back then. I mean, I didn't have my own horse but because I was taking less classes, I was able to ride almost every day. I have my own horse now but my new barn is like an hour away and with taking 5 classes this semester, it's not easy making it out there. Plus, at the old barn I was at when I got to my lowest adult weight, I was much busier. I had to do everything myself, whereas now, I have groom service which has made me lazy haha I seriously just ride then hand my horse off to the groom and sit on my ass for 20 minutes hydrating myself after my rides. 

But yeah overall I was much busier then and I didn't overthink food as much as I do now. And I didn't have time to sit on Reddit all day and get hungry out of boredom. Hopefully trying that "meal plan" will spark something new in me.  </TEXT>

Also I typically do 0-650 a day. I coffee fast 2-3 days a week and on other days my max allowed calories is 650. According to Happy Scale I'm losing on average 4 pounds a week doing this. However every week I plateau for 2-3 days so that definitely slows down my weight loss - maybe you'll have better luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In all honestly, you *probably* can't. Your best bet is to take multivitamins and iron pills if you become iron deficient. Also stay hydrated and don't try more exercise than you can handle. Eating nutrient dense food will also help you feel better. As for hair, I think fish oil is good for your hair? Not 100% on that one though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My biggest thing that helps me get out of situations is agreeing to go, then last minute say something came up. For example, my mom and her boyfriend have been visiting me this weekend and cooking up a TON of super greasy (albeit delicious) foods. They invited me to dinner 2 nights ago and I said "Sure! Let me just make sure I can finish this online assignment and I'll go with you guys!" I had no assignment that was due, but an hour before we planned on going to dinner, I pulled the "Shit. I need at least 2 more hours for this assignment. I'm sorry I can't make it, you guys have a good time though!" And I was able to skip dinner, even though I had already eaten like 1800 calories that day, it was better than eating another 1000+ calories.

I was able to get away with that only once this weekend but I think it's an excuse I may use in the future.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dreaded putting on makeup. I procrastinated watching my favorite TV shows. Reading wasn't even in the question. I avoided working out: I'd have to eat more during the days I worked out, and that was something I didn't want to do, no matter what. Sometimes, I didn't even want to see my friends.

This is exactly how I've been since I started relapsing a few weeks ago. I love working out but restricting makes me not have the energy to do so, and I refuse to eat more just to work out. I have a show I'm a few episodes behind on but I just can't get myself to watch it. I don't see my friends. I make excuses, saying I'm too busy or something came up, when in reality I just don't want to eat. I dread putting on make up as well. No matter how much weight I lose, I never feel pretty or skinny enough, so I think "what's the point? No amount of makeup is going to make me pretty."

he told me to "Keep nurturing your problem, then."

Is this the same friend you mentioned in your post we were going back and forth on? I am so sorry he said that to you. I know you said he was a good friend and very caring, and I'm so sorry he said that. But in reality, he's not wrong. This is why I don't tell people how I feel, no matter how miserable I am, because I know they'll tell me I'm doing this to myself and it's all my fault. That if I ate, I wouldn't have these problems :(

You say you don't know why you experienced the depressive episode, but it all comes down to lack of nutrition. Not eating takes a toll on anyone emotionally. It's so hard. Because not eating = skinny = happy but then eating = not skinny = unhappy. It's a catch 22. 

I am so so sorry you are going through this, but know you are not alone in any of this! I am here for you, we are all here for you and love you and care about you dearly. 

Please stay strong, take care of yourself and ask for help when you need it 3 </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I found my old food diary. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-10 22:28:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had this food diary around the time I reached my lowest adult weight (111) in September 2014. My eating back then seemed so effortless, and so non-ED, but I was able to get to that low weight. My therapist made me keep this food diary so she could keep track of my eating since I was losing so rapidly. 

On average, I would have coffee and a cigarette in the morning, a sandwich thin with a few ounces of sliced chicken and some bagel crisps for lunch (350 calories maybe?), and for "dinner", I would have a protein bar or hummus + pita or apples + peanut butter (about 200-300 calories). And I lost a shit ton of weight with *so many* carbs!

I've been searching for this food diary for weeks to get an idea of what I was eating to get my weight that low again and I'm really surprised I ate as much as I did and lost the weight. It was probably 600-800 calories a day.

Monday-Thursday this coming week are the only days I can *really* restrict, as Friday-Sunday I'm going to Washington DC with my mom. I think I might give my food diary "menu" a chance for 4 days and see how that works out. Actually I'm going to coffee fast tomorrow to get rid of whatever water weight (and probably actual weight) I gained this weekend from my mom being here and cooking. I am so angry with her. I watched her cook and not only did she use vegetable oil, but she would add coconut oil, too! And bacon grease! Gah.  </TEXT>

The last time I ate in public was on Thursday, dinner with my mom and her boyfriend at a restaurant. I ordered a steak and it came with mashed potatoes. I cut the steak into super tiny pieces and separated the potatoes into small forkfuls. It wasn't to make it look like I was eating more or anything, it was just some sort of compulsion. I ate everything on my plate but I must have looked like a  *freak* doing what I did. </TEXT>

And I wish I had someone to talk to about it, but then I feel like people would tell me I only have myself to blame since I'm doing this to myself.  </TEXT>

As far as I know it's just a public horse park. Anyone can ride there and you rent stalls for $10/day. Our local organization reserves the entire park for a weekend a few times a year.

	<TEXT> The Lamictal is actually what kind of started my eating disorder in the first place. It caused me to lose my appetite and I lost a lot of weight. When the decreased appetite side effect wore off, I wanted to continue losing weight, so I kept restricting and fasting and it turned into an eating disorder. I was 14 at the time and my mom got concerned about the weight loss, and though the side effect wore off, I still blamed it on the medication. However 14 year old me was not very smart and when I hit my lowest weight, my mom caught on, realized I had an eating disorder and sought treatment for me. The Prozac didn't effect my appetite in any way - no increase or decrease in appetite. 

You should definitely try getting that job! I need a summer job as well and I really want it to be with animals. I worked at an equine-assisted therapy barn last summer but resigned once the semester started back up. I really want to work there again but I don't know if they'll rehire me since I resigned last year. 

I'm also so happy you have a friend like that! If there is a point where you feel like you want to recover, I'm sure he'll be your best support.

	<TEXT> I'm no longer on any medication. I used to be on Prozac and Lamictal but my psychiatrist and I agreed that my mood/depression/anxiety have been really great for the past year so she took me off them, and I'm doing pretty okay. The eating disorder relapse is definitely inducing some negative emotions, but I'm not ready to tell my psychiatrist about my relapse as I honestly don't want help. 

My horse's name is Raja. I also have 2 cats (lol forgot about those turds) who keep me good company. They're quiet and keep to themselves, but sometimes when I'm sad in bed alone at night, they'll lay in bed with me and it's nice to have the company. I find animals to be very therapeutic. Maybe you can volunteer at an animal shelter? I used to and my duties were walking the dogs and socializing with both the dogs and cats.

One of my best friends knows about my relapse. We don't hang out a lot because I isolate myself because I know she'll make me eat if we're together. But she does the best she can. We both ride horses so she tries to remind me I need fuel to be able to ride, but I am stubborn :P My biggest fear is that she'll tell our trainers that I haven't been eating and they'll say "you can't ride your horse until you eat" or something like that. It sounds like your friend, just like mine, really cares about you. I'm grateful I have the support but at the same time it's such a waste since I'm nowhere near ready to recover :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have borderline personality disorder which is my main diagnosis followed by my eating disorder, depression and anxiety. However, eating disorders, depression and anxiety can all fall under the BPD umbrella. It's really hard. Since I've been restricting again for the past few weeks I've found myself isolating so much because I know social life = food and all I care about is getting thinner and having total control over my weight and calories and exercise. 

I think depression goes hand in hand with having an eating disorder. You get depressed because you don't feel good enough. You get depressed if you eat more than you planned on eating. You get depressed if the scale doesn't budge. Eating disorders are very lonely, and humans are social beings, so naturally you get depressed from the lack of social interaction. 

Fortunately, I have one thing in my life that almost always makes me happy - my horse. No matter what I'm going through, I can always count on him to make me feel better. Whether it's riding him or just going to visit him and feeding him treats.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We met in eating disorder recovery group a few years ago.

I use the term "ex girlfriend" loosely. We were never official but we dated for 3 or so weeks and she broke my heart. We never had sex but we did *stuff* (she had been sexually assaulted in the past so it was hard for her to go "all the way"). Things were going great but suddenly she decided she wasn't ready to date me. Those 3 weeks we dated were the best 3 weeks of my life. 

Right now I'm at the weight I was at when we dated. She was (and obviously still is) attracted to me, but part of me feels like I need to be skinnier before I can sleep with her. Which is stupid because I know she likes my body how it is. In fact my body is better now since I'm more muscular, athletic and fit. But I still feel disgusting and unworthy of sex.

Anyways, this whole thing is so surreal. I know getting into a friends with benefits type relationship will be a bad idea, considering she broke my heart and we both have eating disorders. But as far as we're both concerned, we are both recovered. When we dated we had no problems going to lunches and dinners together and we were comfortable eating with each other. Sometimes she would comment on how little I ate, but I'm like half a foot shorter than her and I never intentionally under-ate around her. 

I just wanted to get that out there. It's so damn weird. We broke up over a year and a half ago and I never imagined she'd ever want something like this. She always prided herself on being interested in serious relationships only and was super against casual dating, hook ups and stuff like that. I mean I guess it's different since we know each other and we would be spending time together as friends as well, but still... </TEXT>

Of course you're doing a good thing for yourself by eating healthy and exercising, and I'm not saying you should stop that. Do you talk to her about what you eat or how you exercise?

If I push through and let the hunger pass, I don't feel the need to eat until like 3pm. The only time I force myself to eat something small is if I'm riding my horse in the morning. So yeah basically I do IF without thinking about it too much. Most of my calories come between 3pm and 5pm. I don't like to eat too close to bedtime because I like going to sleep with my stomach concave. If I do get hungry a few hours before bedtime, I just have something light like fruit or yoghurt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so I'm not going to *die* but I kinda feel like that blueberry girl from Willy Wonka   The Chocolate Factory. 

So my mom and her boyfriend took me out to dinner yesterday. I honestly feel like I ate an entire month's worth of calories in 1 meal. On the bright side, I don't feel as fat as I thought I would feel. My collar bones are still prominent and even though I'm still bloated and look kinda pregnant, I can feel/see my ribs and hip bones. The 2 glasses of wine I drank last night might have dehydrated me a bit? I haven't had alcohol in almost 4 weeks. 

But I'm so disgusted with myself and bloated from last night that I feel like I'll never be able to eat again. How does one eat that much food? I'm terrified of weighing myself today. I also have not been able to use the toilet in like 2 days so that definitely won't help what the scale says. I don't have any laxatives and my stomach is in knots :/ even coffee isn't helping.

Blah I really wish my mom wasn't going to cook this weekend. I think I'm just going to have to (try to) fast all day again and wait for ~~death~~ dinner.

I hope you all have a lovely weekend. 

Edit: I have diuretics but I feel like that would be pointless? I didn't drink much yesterday besides the 2 glasses of wine, but alcohol dehydrates you already, right? But I did eat a lot of high sodium foods so hmm maybe it would be worth a shot.  </TEXT>

Unfortunately, yes. I quit smoking about a year ago (and gained a fuck ton of weight). Since my ED came back a few weeks ago, I've started smoking again. It makes coffee fasts so much more bearable. I've had 3 or 4 packs of cigarettes in the last 2 weeks and fortunately, I haven't become nicotine dependent again. I can't smoke because my mom and her boyfriend are visiting and I've had no nicotine withdrawals (so far). However I think I'll only smoke on coffee fast days to ensure I don't get addicted again. </TEXT>

However, the rest of the weekend will be difficult since I don't have class on Fridays :3 I guess I just have to mentally prepare myself for the number on the scale come Monday. I'll probably just coffee fast on Monday to get rid of all the excess water weight.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! I am a Hunter/Eq rider. I also do a bit of Dressage here and there but the Dressage is mainly to supplement my jumping and equitation. 

I bought my horse when I was 21 in October 2014. At the time, my horse helped me recover from my eating disorder. I was riding more often since I had my own horse and could ride as much as I wanted to, and I was too busy taking care of him (farrier, chiro, vet appointments, etc.) to focus on not eating. I mean, my eating wasn't exactly consistent. There would be days where I would eat well over my TDEE, days where I wouldn't eat at all (because I was too busy) and days where I'd eat only one meal consisting of whatever I wanted. But I was somehow able to maintain a relatively comfortable weight ranging between 115 and 118 despite not counting calories. However within ~6 months I quit smoking which caused me to gain weight. 

I personally do not know any other riders with ED's. I think in the Equitation world specifically, riders are overly scrutinized if they aren't tall and a size 00. I'm very short so I feel like I have to overcompensate with skinniness. None of my trainers have ever put pressure on me to be skinnier, but I look at all the pretty skinny riders who look amazing in their breeches and get sad about myself. 

I want to look like one of those beautiful, tall, lanky Maclay girls. I never thought I'd relapse after buying my horse, who is like a child to me, because rationally I know I need fuel to be the best rider I can be. But wanting to look like one of those blue ribbon winning Eq girls has brought my ED back, unfortunately.

OH and since you want to hear about our horses: Mine is an 18 year old dark bay OTTB who's 15.2hh. [He's a real cutie cutie](http://imgur.com/a/bH1Jg). We showed 2"0 and 2"3 Hunter/Eq stuff last year and did our first rated show AND placed 2nd, 2nd and 3rd! This year we're showing 2"6 with plans to do maybe 2 rated shows. REALLY hoping to go to Thermal in January.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom and her boyfriend arrived last night. They brought food on their way home from the airport and I had some - exactly 14 fries and 5 chicken nuggets. But I'm up 1.4 pounds today. 

**1.4 pounds!!**

I know it's water weight and I haven't used the toilet yet but I feel so disgusting. I don't even want to think about what the scale will say on Monday morning once they're gone. 

Last night when I got into bed, I had so much anxiety about what I had eaten. My heart was racing, I couldn't sleep and I could *feel* myself gaining weight. Clearly I wasn't wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "You can eat a lot as long as you exercise a lot too! Then you'll never get fat!"

UGH! Once I ate a whole lot of pizza and I was telling my gf at the time how gross I felt/how much I regretting eating it/how I'll get fat and she said "well why don't you just work it off at the gym tomorrow?"

You can't outrun your fork! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll definitely try that with the potatoes. She makes chicken curry, too, so I can scrape the curry part off and just eat the chicken. 

And I will definitely post once they've left! Ugh they already had me eat fries today and I can *feel* the weight gain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. I had such an amazing lesson this morning which really pumped me up for this weekend...then a few hours ago my trainer texted saying it was cancelled. 

I'm actually supposed to be going out to dinner with a friend tonight who knows about my ED stuff. It's more like, hookah and chill rather than dinner, but if she eats and I don't, I'll feel really bad. I have no idea what I'm going to do tonight. 

And yeah on average I'm at like 500 cals/day with 2-3 days of fasting every week. I don't really eat meals, just small stuff throughout the day. Hopefully my stomach cooperates. Maybe tonight with my friend I can *try* to eat dinner to see how my stomach feels. That way, if I do get sick, I can just tell my mom in the morning that the restaurant food made me sick. But I don't know. The though of eating an actual meal scares me so much :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm. Usually she curries or pan fries the potatoes, so I could ask her to curry the potatoes, that way I can scrape the curry off at pick at the potato. With eggs she likes to fry them but I can ask her to use cooking spray or something instead + egg whites only. I only eat egg whites anyways so hopefully she understands.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I could definitely say my appetite is off because I'm sad about the show being cancelled. I did tell my mom I was trying to lose weight though diet and exercise (aka the healthy, normal way) but I have lost a bit too much weight for the time period I said I started dieting and exercising. But I'll just reiterate to her that I've been going hard at the gym and riding more. Thank you for your support 3 I'll also try to see what I can get away with. She typically cooks a lot of eggs, chicken and potatoes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's going to rain heavily this weekend so the show has been cancelled. My mom and her boyfriend are supposed to be flying down for it. I texted my mom saying it got cancelled and she hasn't replied. I don't know if she'll still come if it's cancelled, but I'm 80% sure she'll still come. 

ED wise, this will take a huge toll on me. I already was expecting that I'd eat a lot since my mom will be here cooking and stuff, but now that I'm not showing, I'll be spending more time with her and her boyfriend, meaning it'll be almost impossible to skip out on meals. My initial plan when the show was still on was to say I'm too nervous in the morning to eat breakfast, hang out at the show and not eat while her and her boyfriend go out and do stuff in the afternoon, then pick at whatever dinner she makes. 

But now I'll be around them for all 3 meals. Sigh. I feel like such a horrible person for being upset about having my wonderful, loving mother around for 4 days. 

I'm particularly worried about the first meal I'll have with them. I haven't had an actual meal in over 2 weeks so I don't know how my body will respond. If I get sick from it, my mom will be highly suspicious about how I've been eating lately. It doesn't help that she'll see I've lost weight and already be suspicious about that. 

Have any of you experienced any physical issues with eating a meal after restricting for a long time? </TEXT>
