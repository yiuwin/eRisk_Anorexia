	<TEXT> Well this is a hard one, there's just so many, but I'll go with the one that's personally affected me the most. Sexism. Especially today, people feel they deserve something or to be treated someway, based only on their gender.

Sexism is always viewed poorly, it's obvious both genders are separate in nature, but both remain equal. Instead we stereotype each other, and struggle because of so. I was always taught to hold doors for women, I never really considered why until a feminist was insulted by it, today I just see it as helping another earthling and can kind of understand why she was insulted.

I think we spend to much time analyzing each other, rather than just seeing a common goal. We all want to be successful, have a good relationship, do what we love, just happen to look different while doing so. Given there are subtle differences, but each person is different, when you try to figure out a whole gender at once, you're going to be baffled!

I hope that answers your question, any form of stereotyping really annoys me. I'm sure everyone has been stereotyped in some way, it's plain stupid. But thanks for asking the question!

Best of luck! </TEXT>
