My first LAN tournament and I had a blast, the crowd was amazing and the games were a blast. 

Hoping for the event to be hosted in Croatia again the next year. Agree with the suggestions

- more food options

- souvenir shop or let teams set up shop

- arrange meet and greets for the fans

Swindlezz is awesome, talked to him 3 times in 2 days. Not to mention how great he was at the desk. 

Hope to see more events like this in Croatia.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys. 
I'm looking for resources that would help me improve my comedy writing skills, do you have anything to recommend? 

I already did 6 stand-up shows, 4 open mics and 2 gigs (stand up is very rare where I come from so even if you're kinda good word goes around fast). 

My material is mostly really dark humor, "gallows humor" as you would say, and I would like do more than that. I can line up one liners for days but I'm having a lot of difficulty writing longer bits or connected jokes. 
Currently I'm just trying out new things but I would appreciate any kind of help. 

Thanks in advance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone meditate in sets like you would usually do a work out? 

Instead meditating for 20 min straight why not do two 10 min rounds with a break in the middle? 

What are the benefits of doing "endurance" meditation instead of short concenteated sessions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there. 

First the specs: Windows 8 64 bit, graphics card - GeForce GTX 650 Ti

TV: it's a Quadro LCD TV 

I'm trying to display my PC on my TV using a HDMI cable but nothing I've tried so far seems to work. 

Here are images of the cable and ports: http://imgur.com/a/HFAJd

I use the HDMI port in the first pic (second row, first one to the left). 
There's another smaller HDMI port in the second pic (last row on the right side) but I don't have a cable that can fit. 

What seems to be the problem? Why can't my TV recognize my PC? 

I've tried switching between HDMI and PC displays on my TV but that didn't work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a question related to OP's original one. 

I don't get the people commenting here. The OP wanted controversial questions, he got them. 

Instead of upvoting the controversial ones and getting an actual discussion going, everything is being downvoted to hell. 

I'm mostly surprised by the approach by those who answer. Yes, racism isn't cool, but instead of downvoting and belittling the one asking, which will only make him not listen to you, why not engage with him and explain your view?

	<TEXT> This! This is what has been bothering me for a long time and I didn't know what it was. 

My brain feels beaten down by work, yet I don't do that much. 
I'm on my phone when driving in a car (as a passenger), when on the bathroom or walking my dog (podcasts). 
Most of my time is spent on or with the internet. I didn't realize it till now. 

There are many more factors for me being "burned out" but controlling what information gets in my brain better could do me good. 

Thanks for the interesting viewpoint.  </TEXT>
