	<TEXT> I'm not denying climate change and the purpose of my original thread wasn't to show that I voted for Trump because of his climate change. It was supposed to point out that there are other reasons people can vote for a candidate than just climate change.

I have no doubt that the earth is warming and it's a serious problem, but to what effect is that influencing the severity of storms? There isn't enough data to show that yet. 

My problem with the EPA is that they are known to overstep their boundaries and they are the judge, jury, and executioner when it comes to making environmental decisions. Why is it that Europe (who is very climate change friendly) all have diesel cars (especially VW's) but our EPA decided Volkswagons weren't acceptable in the U.S.? So much that VW had to cheat emissions tests just to be able to sell them. That is the problem I have with the EPA and I don't think it'll be a bad thing that they are going to be reformed.

	<TEXT> So you think the only reason for voting for him was climate change and vaccines? And you are equating every decision he makes based on his climate change stance? Ok I can do the same thing. How can Hillary Clinton make any rational decision based on the evidence that she set up her own email server and had confidential information on it? I can't believe college educated voters would support her. I know this isn't on the top of her list, but how does that make her leader?

Maybe people voting for him for his economic message or his border stance. Maybe people voted for him because they don't want 400,000 Syrian refugees to come in this country not vetted. There isn't just one reason to vote for someone I hate to tell you. Also you don't have to agree with everything your candidate says to vote for them either. If you voted for Clinton do you consider black people to be  superpredators? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But it does have a technical meaning, it's not semantics. 

An assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine

That's from Wikipedia and there Are a couple sources to go along with it. Keyword here is 'selective-fire' meaning you can switch from semi-automatic to full auto.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No I don't mind explaining things to people that have never been familiar with something that I know about. Well, this is another example of uninformed people making laws. In NY and some other northern states you cannot have more than 2 of these specific criteria they made up. If it has a magazine it can't have a telescoping stock, grenade launcher attachment (idk why this is even a thing), a threaded barrel, and I think there's one more. NONE of these make a rifle an assault rifle. As I said before an assault rifle can be switched from semiautomatic to fully automatic. They just call them assault rifles to push their agenda and because assault rifles sound scarier than semi-automatic rifles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We call semi-automatic AR-15's assault rifles

This is the problem. They are not assault rifles, and no AR doesn't stand for 'Assault Rifle' it stands for 'Armalite Rifle' the original creators of the rifle. This is why pro second amendment people get upset because people mislabel and jump to these conclusions all of the time and especially that congress and lawmakers aren't educated with guns and they are the ones making the laws. Also, no semi-automatic rifles are not assault rifles. By definition assault rifles can be switched from single-fire to automatic fire (only military weapons have this ability).  So when the article states that Amazon delivered an assault rifle... It makes me think they delivered a fully automatic military grade M16, which would be a much much bigger issue than the semi-automatic rifle. That would be like Amazon delivering Advil and the article stated they sent OxyContin.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't defend the Carson pick because I don't know enough of his background to comment. However, the EPA has been on a liberal torrent of regulation for a long time now. It is due for some checks and balances. The clean water act and the clean air act aren't going anywhere. The EPA isn't going anywhere, but they are the judge, jury, and executioner when it comes to any environmental regulation.  For example very environmentally friendly EU countries drive mostly diesel cars, but our laws are so strict that VW has to cheat the system just to be able to sell their diesel cars here? Probably some overreach there, but I'm sure someone got paid off to force those laws through. There's nothing wrong with a little pushback when it comes to stuff like that. 

Just because Devos doesn't have the same views on eduction as you doesn't mean she's detrimental to education. The wants to get rid of common core and allow students to choose the school they attend instead of basing off district. She also wants to give vouchers to help students to go to private schools that can't afford it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't say they were more likely, but if one of them votes that is illegal. If they don't have a voter ID then they can't vote. 
If your voter ID has your state on it then you can't go to another state and vote. 

Really not a hard concept. You need an ID for virtually everything in the United States why is it such a big deal to require an ID to vote? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You said the GOP has no positions not republican-backed bills. You are changing the argument. 

Here's a list of 557 bills proposed by the house republicans. Not all of these have been voted on yet, but the ones passed in December:


 gt;Improving Broadband Access for Veterans Act of 2016

 gt;To amend the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, to reauthorize the Missing Alzheimers Disease and Patient Alert Program, and to promote initiatives that will reduce the risk of injury and death relating to the wandering characteristic

 gt;Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act

 gt;To provide greater transparency and congressional oversight of international insurance standards setting processes, and for other purposes

 gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act

 gt;To require the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to establish a program for the medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment of astronauts, and for other purposes

 gt;Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that all students should have access to the digital tools necessary to further their education and compete in the 21st century economy

These are some of the bills JUST PASSED THIS MONTH. Get your head out of your ass if you think the republicans don't pass any good bills. You are ignorant. 

Edit: here is the website with the list of all of the bills.
