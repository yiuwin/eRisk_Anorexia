	<TEXT> Cheers. I had some of the anti diarrheal stuff. I wish I could stop the bloating and the burping. I haven't come into contact with any unclean water that I know of. I only guessed it was giardiasis from googling about the sulfur  burps. My sister was sick last week with vomiting when she stayed at my house , then her baby was sick too and vomited a lot. I changed her babies diaper while she was over. Her husband got incredibly sick a few days ago and vomited a lot. Could it be food poisoning? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's Christmas Eve here and so I don't think I'll be able to see a doctor for about 2 days. I haven't been feeling well all week. I had a cold and that started to get better after 2 days. Then on day 3 my cold was gone but I had nausea. Now I've got stomach cramps (thought it was my period) but I completely lost my appetite too, and I get these burps that smell like rotten egg. From what I googled, they're "sulfur burps". I also have diarrhea, but it's more watery than anything else. 

Is there anything I can do to stop the burping and the diarrhea over Christmas til I can see a doctor?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once got on a train at Redfern during peak hour and spotted a free two seater, so I grabbed it before anyone else. I sat down on the outside seat (luckily) and only after I had sat down did I notice the huge pile of spew next to me. I should have known there was a reason why a two seater was free on a crowded train. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My uncle died two days ago. I was at a loss at how to comfort my cousin. My partner (who has lost her late partner, then 6 months later, her dad) gave me the exact same advice. She said it also didn't help that people would comfort her and say "oh you're still young, you'll find someone else". The other things that helped were when people brought over groceries instead of flowers, because she couldn't really muster up energy to go to the shops for anything. She said she was also grateful when people bought over boxes of tissues because she was always running out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True. I worked in a store and I had a man go on a racist rant towards me and I was just shocked. My coworkers were shocked too, no one said anything. He left and we spoke to our manager about it, and he brushed it off with "just ignore it, the customer is always right". 

It's one thing to say racist horrible things online, but when someone is saying it to your face, it does leave you a bit flabbergasted and speechless.  </TEXT>
