	<TEXT> Actually lights do need to be inspected for MVI if it's the first time the vehicle has been inspected in Nova Scotia. After the first time, the lights no longer need to work to pass MVI (though it's still against the law to drive around without working lights - ie. you'll pass the inspection, but not the cops). Tbh I'm not sure why lights don't need to be inspected for MVI... I guess as soon as you leave the garage your light could burn out, but then again, an hour after MVI any number of things could go wrong with your car.

In terms of spending money on having lights installed; my local CT charges $15 for most lights, but still, if you can do it yourself that's always going to be a lot cheaper.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only thing I can think is that they quoted ATE pads/rotors which are the only brand that are up that high in cost for most vehicles. Still, if you're trying to sell a brake job, it's usually better to give the customer some more cost friendly options. That much money on brakes and rotors would scare a lot of people away. </TEXT>
