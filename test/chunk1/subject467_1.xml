	<TITLE> LED's Too much light? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-03-08 17:12:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Basically I'm having a bit of trouble with my grow. This is week four or five and the plants just don't seem to be growing a lot. there is also a fair bit of disparity in size at this point which leads me to think there may be a couple of issues here.

Firstly my water is very alkaline so i have been adjusting that since about two and a half weeks ago as i was getting a fair bit of nutrient lockout with very yellowing and dieing leaves, i'm still getting a bit of yellowing towards the centre of some of the plants but what's more worrying is the death of cells towards the edge of leaves. I did have my light a lot lower and within a day i had much more dead material so i am beginning to think it might be too much light for them.

I am using a 450w multi-spectrum LED panel and there is lots of ventilation so I don't think heat is really an issue. (will be getting a thermometer soon). Still after raising the panel a bit most of the plants just seem to have stopped growing, previous CFL   HPS grows have gone fine with little effort really so i'm a bit confused as this is the second lot of seeds that i have tried here.

I could realyl do with a little more insight into this as i'm kind of tearing my hair out!

Who would you choose? Do you go for skills or novelty value? Bare in mind you have the potential to be the last of your gender and the pick of your species; do you spend the rest of your days sexing up hot ladies of your choosing with little or no defense against roving bands of mutants?   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> First ever pay review on Thursday. Whats the best way to go about it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-02-20 17:51:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm sure there are more redditors that are/will be in a similar situation so hopefully this thread can be of some benefit to others too!

3 months ago i started my first proper job (after lots of bar and kitchen work!) as assistant editor for a TV post production company, as my contract stipulates i have a 3 month probationary period with a pay review at the end (bieng paid very little at the moment while i "prove myself"). On thursday i am sitting down with HR to talk about how i have done and to discuss a more permanent salary.

So I ask the reddit masses; what are the best ways to talk about how i have done in a shining positive light? Make them want to do what they can to keep me as an employee? And get the most out of the job? How much should i be aiming for? (UK so not sure if much different from the US)

I do love this job and as its the career I'm going for I hope to be a developing asset for this company; I'm just not sure how that translates money wise! And I'm more than a little worried about that dreaded question: "How much do you think you should be paid?"

Thanks in advance and of course I'll update with how it goes! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having recently gotten out of a four year relationship I'm feeling myself starting to want to get back on the horse so to speak. There is a lovely lady i work with who has caught my eye and we have had drinks and we even just had a meal together. The thing is i don't have the slightest clue on how to flirt or show i would be interested in being anything other than friends. 

She is heading out of town for a long while tomorrow so i think my ship has sailed with this one but i could sure use a bit of advice as a newly single male who has only been with two girls, both long relationships, one of whom is now a lesbian (another story). </TEXT>

Now i have settled in a large house with good friends and we all plan on staying for a fair while, seeing as how its quite a party house i really miss playing out my vinyl collection! 

I guess i could buy some decks again but seeing as how much of the vinyls were white labels and bootlegs gathered since 2002 its not the kind of collection i have much chance of rebuilding in much the same way. /sadpanda </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-01-22 20:57:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Basically a friend who works for an events company has asked me if i can help set up the "games" part of this conference in the UK. It will be roughly 2000 people from major electronics company so everything kind of has to run smooth as silk.

They want three Xbox 360s with Kinect running some kind of party game (probably sports or Olympics related) that we can turn into some kind of competition, i am imagining that the best way is to do some kind of "winner stays on" arrangement rather than a tournament of some sort; but i imagine the game will largely dictate this. 

Each console will be hooked up to a large TV and a big projector mirroring the TV, this bit I'm okay with but they are hoping to have the consoles networked up to play against each other. I'm wondering if there are even any kinect games that will do this.

While I'm a big gamer I'm pretty out of touch with kinect! So I was wondering if you guys might have any ideas in regards to games that might work well in this environment and/or can be played over a network? </TEXT>

I really like a shred around on a frosty morning but with a funny nose and stinging ears it is sometimes a bit of a mission to breach the warm comfort of home in search of a bracing winter ride.

With this in mind what do you guys and gals use in regards to keeping your eyes, ears, noses and lips from running away, chapping up and stinging like a slapped ass? I have seen face masks and ear protectors here and there but what is worth looking out for and what has everyone had good experience with? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The situation is thus: 

I live with my partner whom I love very much in a flat with a fair amount of space. She works very long hours and very hard for pretty bad money. I work as long but probably less hard for pittance. I smoke a bit (not much at all recently) and she smokes every now and then after work if i am.

I grew three years ago when we were not living together and it was one of the best things I have ever experienced: very fulfilling, amazing weed, a little extra income blah blah blah.

We are pretty low on cash and the weed where we have moved to because of her job is seriously sketchy (always crap and usually sprayed). So the benefits of this operation are a given.

She says things like the "smell is too strong" or "too much equipment" but there are obvious counters to this so it seems she is more just against it as a whole. I respect her opinion but it is really unfounded and this would be a solution to so many problems without impacting too much on her (I have my own room for my man stuff anyway.)

She is probably the most stubborn person I know and it takes a lot to shift when her mind is set, even if for no apparent reason. But there must be a way! So ents; i implore you, impart your wisdom unto us. and present your best thought out, rational and convincing arguments for a home midi grow!

ps, we live in the UK if that has any bearing. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is an idea i have been toying with for a while. I was going to set up a website for it a while ago but i have a feeling it may take off a little better here. It really came about as looking at my Ableton Live project folder and i currently have 174 projects, of which only 20ish are properly finished tracks, it would be great to upload some of the best bits of some and see where people can take them!

I see there are lots of talented people here on reddit from all sorts of disciplines but collaboration is always a daunting prospect, often relying on constant communication and trust. What i am proposing is a more open source approach or perhaps with the use of the various creative commons agreements.

As an instrumentalist/vocalist etc you record yourself and upload your riff or stem with a little info about it and/or a suggestion as to its use. And as a producer you can download this material and use it for free in your tracks and upload your finished/wip material that perhaps someone else can take even further.

Of course there is plenty of room for everything in-between such as uploading stems from your tracks or partly finished projects like i mentioned earlier but the emphasis would have to be on original material and not just interesting riffs that you like/found that you would like to hear in a tune.

I feel that this is something radio reddit could very much get behind too and would provide a nice stream of original content!
Anyway, if there is any interest then we can set something up and see where it goes. Not sure about names at the moment tbh but i was thinking something like "Tracklab" or "MusicWorkshop".


**Edit: its done!**


http://www.reddit.com/r/letsallmakemusic/

While setting up i did find a similar subreddit for collaborating (r/musicinthemaking) but it was kind of the opposite of what I'm proposing by having everyone upload as they wish.

However; I'm going to France for 2 weeks as of Thursday and i wont have any internets. Please get in contact if you would like to moderate and we will sort something out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm going to France next week and I'm taking my own bike for the first time. 

I assume its illegal to take the cartridges in hand luggage where they wouldn't be exposed to much pressure change but what about in the unpressurised hold with the rest of my luggage? My only thought is that they are already under a regulated pressure with just a thin foil seal.

Does anyone have experience with this?

	<TEXT> So I'm setting up my microgrowery again and its the time to choose seeds. I have space for a couple of plants so i was thinking maybe just one or two different strains just for fun; one sativa and an indica.

Last time i grew sartori mandala so I'm very tempted by that again but i guess this is a chance to try something new!

I have tried a fair few strains but when you don't always grow yourself its hard to tell if you are actually getting exactly what you're sold. 

So tell us of your favourite grows, cerebral highs and tasty nugs. There are a lot of strains out there so lets have your experience!  </TEXT>

For me and my friends a lot of ours come from [this game](http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/bigboxshots/0/926180_62375_front.jpg). Whenever someone uses a flamethrower to great effect it is "MAXIMO Scorchio!" or if someone blocks another by drinving in front of them side on its a "T-Bone manoeuver". We tend to say "sure i can" a lot too as one of the cars is called the Shuriken. True story.

	<TITLE> Just wanted to share a little about my beloved dealer. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-07-24 18:34:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So basically she is going through a lot at the moment and i just wanted to share her story so we can maybe learn a bit and apreciate those around us a little bit more.

I'm usually one of those guys where picking up is strictly business but i have had a couple of smokes with her and she is such a nice girl. I have only found out these things second hand so each time is has truely shocked me that i had no idea this was happening to someone so close.

Firstly she is seeing another girl and everything was going great until she found out that this girl's family has arranged for her to be married to a guy she doesnt even really know. The relationship was pretty serious so dealer is with someone who has to keep thier relationship secret for fear of bieng rejected from her entire family. The choice is spending her time with the girl she loves (my dealer) or a lifetime married to a man as a closet lesbian.

This has definately taken its toll emotionally and she has been in a bad place. Over the past half year i have noticed her bieng thinner and thinner each time i pick up. I thought it was all because of this. 

I was told yesterday that she is now in hospital. It turns out her appendix burst, not recently but SIX months ago. Since then she has literally been dying; eaten from the inside by bacteria. Before bieng taken to the hospital she was sick blood and bile around her kitchen for which her housemates are refusing to let her back in the house (because she didnt clean it up). 

The doctors say she is an absolute biological miricle and she should be dead by all accounts. She is stable now but the future is far from bright, wieghing in at just under 6 stone. With little to look forward to.

I know this is kind of depressing but it has had me in tears thinking about the gravity of the whole situation and how fragile life really is. Also how lucky i am to be healthy with a job and able to live my life as i like.

Toke up for those less fortunate. For they may be closer than you realise. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my lady (whom i currently live with in Brighton) has been given a promotion and will be moving to portsmouth. I have just finished Uni and a lot of my friends are leaving so i'm not sure theres any real reason to stick around, i am hopeing to work in sound production so maybe the competition is a little less fierce for media jobs outside of brighton.

We have found a flat in Cosham, not sure about the area but the flat is very nice.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone could give me a bit of a insight into portsmouth and its various districts. I am really sad to be leaving the bubble of brighton so tell me anything and everything that will make me a little bit happier to move.

Bonus points for things i enjoy:

Producing sound
Mountain Biking
Cooking
Interesting music events </TEXT>

So I was wondering if anyone knows of techniques or exercises we can do to repeat it? We are aware of kegel exercises but seeing as she has the ability we are guessing there's certain knack to it! </TEXT>

I have picked my nose and eaten it for as long as I can remember. Same goes for scabs and bits of skin (only my own: standards). I also sometimes separate a pubic hair from its buddies and yank it out, the relief after the initial pain is quite satisfying and if it has a small bit of root attached extra pube points are acquired.

My SO is away until Tuesday so I'm home alone for the weekend. As soon as I finish work I am picking up a quater 8th and all my favourite munch before I slowly destroy my body over the course of the evening. 

In order to do this however I need adequate entertainment, I will probably fit some "life in the undergrowth" in at some point and maybe some "samurai champloo" or cowboy bebop. But I could really do with some recommendations of wiered films too. I have a VERY low cheeseyness threshold when I'm stoned so the darker and quirkier the better. Stuff along the lines of "enter the void", "oldboy", "brazil", "march of the penguins" and "moon", For some namechecks!

I'm pretty open so help me build my playlistand i shall keep you updated with the state of my sanity as the next couple of evenings progress!  </TEXT>
