	<TITLE> Concorde may have been before its time, but what about a remake using new turbofans instead of after-burning jets? Possible? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-10-20 07:27:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems the engines these days are powering forward (no pun intended) and turbofans are getting smaller and more powerful.

From what I understand Concorde originally rejected turbofans because of their weight, size and in the end drag. What are peoples thoughts on the Brits (or others) redesigning the long range super speeder with new turbofans? Would the airspeed still be drastically smaller or would a similar outcome be possible with new technology? I'm sure turbofans still couldn't hit 2000kph like the jets, but maybe we're closer than back in the 70s?

I won't bring up the fly by wire possibilities, that's another conversation.

Just a thought :) Looking forward to hearing opinions, I'm no engineer so excuse me if this is completely ridiculous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * As soon as you start a new sandbox open the reports on the bottom right and start the one for 40k, you'll get 40k to build your prison. These Grants are your quests.

* Objectives already completed when you pick up a grant are automatically marked as complete, so don't feel like you have to take every grant right away.

* The 40k you get from one of the first grants is more than enough to complete its objectives. Use this extra money to plan ahead in your foundations. It's not possible to resize rooms and it's very easy to ruin ground and have patchy rooms, your best bet is to build big first, and furnish to your size later.

* Send your guards to specific rooms during the regime to watch prisoners. Try not to have prisoners alone for too long.


* Try to have 2 staff only doors on your prison exit, them felons are sneaky and often make a dash when crew are moving through the main door.

* Don't feel like all your prisoners need to be able to interact. Don't be afraid to build different wings.

* It's easy to forget about windows, but they make a hell of a difference.

* Water pipes must pass directly under the object to supply it.

* Install security cameras!

* It's a good idea to keep a decent holding cell available for when you want to resize or change part of your prison. We can't expect prisoners to just wait for you while you knock the walls down can we?

* Don't forget to set door permissions by click the door!

* PLAN AHEAD, DON'T EYEBALL, SUMMON YOUR INNER ENGINEER!

	<TEXT> Hello!

Me and a friend will be flying into LA from New Zealand, staying a few nights then moving on to Vegas. Basically we're just looking for some cheap accommodations, but more specifically *safe* accomodation :p

We've looked at the Cecil Hotel, which is at 640 South Main ST, Downtown. $30-$40 a night. That being said we have no idea about locations, where's ok to hang out etc.

Appreciate any suggestions or advice!

See you soon! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, I work in the central city at a startup company that revolves around businesses facebook pages. I will be moving to London in October and am looking for someone with decent web skills (html/css good but not required) to continue on my role of building facebook app tabs for our clients. At this stage I handcode each one from a template, however I'm hopefully going to have a CMS done before I leave to make building these easier (and codeless).

If you're interested send me a PM, we can catch up sometime soon and move forward! While it's a young company now, the opportunity to grow with the business is enormous.

	<TEXT> Hey guys, I'm a Kiwi that will be in London with a 2 year visa near the end of 2012 and will be looking to get a 3-6 month contract as a front end web developer (css3/jQuery/html5). I also have skills in C# and PHP but would like to keep things simple so front end it is.


I've worked in web development for 5 years now so am looking at the 250-300 pound a day jobs.


I'm really not sure what to expect though, I'm redoing an online CV that will show my front end *skills* and include a few letters of recommendation. But will I be asked to perform in front of them? I've never really had a full on interview before so obviously landing in London and going to 3-4 will be stressful, especially if I'm caught off guard with their requests or questions.

Appreciate any advice!!

	<TITLE> Where I think dayZ fails, vehicles and hive (not a rant) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-01 01:39:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been a server owner and pretty active admin of dayZ for some time now. During this time I've experienced what I think are very poor gameplay mechanics that Rocket simply couldn't foresee becoming problematic, for whatever reasons these are core parts of the game that I hope get addressed before we leave testing.

This isn't a rant, the points I bring up are not trivial, they are extremely obvious effects that anyone could foresee happening with the current systems. I'll get started.

1. You're pretty much forced to hide the vehicles you find, and never touch them. There are not enough vehicles!!!!! If you manage to find and fix one, the only thing that goes through your head is where you can hide it where it wont get stolen, as god knows you'll probably never find another this week. Increase the amount of vehicles so people are feel encouraged to use them. Not horde them.


2. Connecting all servers together. Ok whoever thought of this should be shot. You kill any sort of community a server can have as it's simply a merry go round of players day after day. No need to mention loot hoppers, but that's a huge issue too. You've basically demanded a totalitarian rule across all servers, with us admins being your bill paying idiots with absolutely 0 control. I'd like to ask again the execution of whoever came up with this..

That's it! 2 small points that ruin the game IMO!

TL;DR - You're only encouraged to hide   horde vehicles with the small number of them in servers. Once you do find one, server hop till you get all the parts to fix it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, for the last few days I've been exploring the possibility of using Arduino or Netduino for a project of mine. I have a number of questions I hop you guys can help me with :)

I'm a c# programmer and have been playing around with AI code for awhile now, and while the little simulators I build are great for testing I think it's time to take things physical. I'm not sure where Arduino/Netduino stops and other hardware/software will need to fill in but hopefully that's where yall come in :p

Basically I want to build a small AI driven robotic vehicle (think a vacuum cleaner for lonely people). I need to be able to write this on a Mac, and it really need to be extendible as much as possible (not sure if things like Arduino have a component or power limit).

Some of the starter kits seem like a nice start, but TBH I would expect an almost 10x price tag for what I'm trying to accomplish, really I'm just looking for advice for a Mac c# programmer to make a small robot, any information would be gold.

Thanks!

	<TITLE> Looking into living in Chiang Mai as a freelancer </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-03-26 15:22:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a designer and programmer and have freelanced before. I have a strong list of contacts so assume I have steady work coming in. This is all work I can do from anywhere with semi-ok broadband. My idea at the moment is to stay in Chaing Mai for some time while working on these projects. Of course I am in love with Thailand, but I must say the cost of living (and food) is a huge drawcard, even if it only ended up being a few months while I worked a few projects saving some money and experiencing the country would be amazing.

My main questions are:

* Should I just hotel hop or try rent a place? Considering I would be spending 3-4 hours a day/night working here too
* Is there any crazy tax or info I should know about constantly withdrawing foreign currency? (seeing as I will still be paid into my home bank acc)
* Is the internet reliable in Chiang Mai specifically?

While I can accept I will not pick up Thai language, I've lived in *similar* places (Fiji) before so am not expecting huge living shocks. Any tips   advice is **much** appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> New timeline for Pages is broken </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-03-01 02:34:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We've had a client publish the new timeline that will go live on the 31st of March. However now whenever a page admin views the page we get nothing more than a cover image, avatar and number of likes. No admin link, No edit page, no posts/wall/timeline. We can't change it back once published, so it seems it's just stuck in Limbo. The new page manager thing for previewing timelines  (normally to turn on and off the preview) doesn't list any options next to our page :\

You can see the fail - http://imgur.com/cmkJv

Any suggestions? XD </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Using Unity to make non game software. Yes no? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-02-27 23:48:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a project coming up that involves creating a point of sale system of sorts. It will be rather simple and involve matching invoice items to files and images sitting in local folders. I have alot of experience using Unity C# and know it can handle file IO operations no problem. Alot of the images this software will handle are rather large but I already know Unity C# can handle all the functions we need.

My question, is it completely retarded to use purely Unity GUI and make an application like this? The up sides I see at the moment is the ability to use cross platform (PC, Mac) as well as deploy 'trade show' versions on tablets (iOS, android). Unity is obviously a plus in that direction.

Thoughts? Problems? Alternatives welcome :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just got scammed by this profile http://steamcommunity.com/id/yummybunny while trading $30 of games for a dota2 invite for my friend. Thought I would surprise him this Saturday but my good deed has gone rather punished.

If this thread saves another person from getting scammed then at least my loss wasn't for nothing.

	<TEXT> Hey guys, we're are hoping to gather some stats about our recently upgraded hardware and are looking to get 100-200 people online within the next hour or so. All you have to do is jump in minecraft and connect to mc.emmz.com

If you'd like to stick around and play that's awesome, but the main purpose here is for us to gather resource stats about how our server handles this.

See you in world!
