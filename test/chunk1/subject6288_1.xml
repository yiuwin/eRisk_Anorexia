	<TEXT> For me, I love my laptop but also nothing beats old fashioned pen and paper. I feel that I can get more of my thoughts out with pen and paper than just mindlessly typing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I couldn't believe what I had in my hands.

Everything I was writing, it was almost instantly showing up in real life. I knew something like this has to be kept secret and definitely wasn't safe but I needed to tell someone.

I biked to my friend's house as fast as I could. In between panting breaths, I explained everything to her about what I had.

Out of all the things she could have said.

"Does that mean...we can write ourselves into Ocean's Eleven and become rich?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Well done. Fuck you," I said as I stormed out of the building. "Earning this money is worth being someone's pee-on and momma didn't raise me to be someone's bitch."

I stormed out of the building, threw my ID card into the bushes, and headed to my car ready to never look back.

That was when I was filled with dread.

I stopped dead in my tracks in the parking structure, whipped out my phone and tried to dial my coworker's number as fast as I could.

"Laurel? Hi Laurel! Yeah, well momma didn't raise no bitch. I totally forgot that today was the company lunch at that Italian place though! Perfect timing to walk out, eh? Can you pick up my food and I'll meet you around the corner? A girl's still gotta eat tonight."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had just lost my job. I couldn't believe it. My boss picked the new stiff suit over me and I barely had any time to grab my stuff before walking out the door. I even lost my notebook full of stories thanks to the security who basically threw me out the door without letting me go through all my drawers first. They gave me enough time to take my cup with the company name, Briersber Limited, printed on it. I threw it in the bushes as soon as I left the building.

Kicking rocks as I was walking down the murky, cracked sidewalks on Broadway, I noticed something shining under some soaked leaves and garbage in the gutter up a ways. 

"I might as well, it's not like the day isn't already in the trash," I thought to myself as I followed the hypnotizing glimmer. 

I sifted through the grime and finally saw what that glimmer was that had stuck through the much. A thick book with a leather cover and a golden lock and key had been dumped out into the trash and from what I could see, it was brand spankin' new.

"Man, this isn't cheap. I wonder why someone got rid of this," I asked myself as I wiped the dirty water off the cover and stuck it deep inside my messenger bag.


I got home right before it started raining and knew that with this much thunder, I wouldn't be leaving for the rest of the night. After eating my leftovers and contemplating on whether to call my folks or not to let them know about my job misfortunes, I remembered that I lost my treasured notebook with all of the stories that had been rattling my brain.

That is when I remembered what I had found.

Sitting on my bed, I took the leather book out of my bag and saw that there was some writing on the cover. It looked like it had been inscribed in a language I had never seen. There was also an animal on the front that looked like a cross between a jungle cat and one of those monsters you only hear about in Greek Mythology. 

"This is so cool," I whispered as I ran my fingers over the cover, feeling the indentations of the foreign writing.

Figuring that I was never going to see my beloved notebook again and that I could make light of my situation by writing it out, I took the key, stuck it into the golden lock and heard the opening click.

The pages were unused and creamy white. I couldn't wait to get my hands dirty so I grabbed my lucky pen and started writing away.

"And karma finally came for the overzealous security guard when he met his fate with the speeding traffic bustling through the intersection after he spent his day stealing away from the company he said he loved," I read aloud to myself before ending the section.

After the long day I had, I couldn't write anymore. I locked up the notebook, threw it on my nightstand, and fell right asleep.

Being a person that can't sleep without some kind of background noise, my television had been on the entire night. The local news was on and something I heard in my sleep triggered my body to wake up and see what was on.

Rubbing my tired eyes, I searched for my glasses so I could see what had woken me up. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the the breaking headline said, "Security Guard Killed By Speeding Truck Outside Briersber Ltd." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi!

For tone, I try to read as many similar themes as I can just to get a feel and flow going. For me, it's kinda like method acting. I have to immerse myself to whatever I am writing, get a complete feel as if I am there, and use my own feelings and whatnot to describe and insert imagery to set the tone.

As for the broaching of different subjects, it's all in how you present it. There are boring, cookie cutter ways and with a little creative thinking and wording, you can draw people in by keeping them interested. For me (just as an example), it's like the difference between Forensic Files and Cold Case Files. Forensic Files brings the exact same material about murders and death as Cold Case Files but presents them in such a way, you can't turn away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To make even more of a creepy/thriller sort of feel, you can have the minor go off into a known bad/sketchy area with a stranger to buy one.

As for the scare, Falstaffe is on to something. OR, you can do something like where the phone call is an omen for the victim e.g. the phone call has him on the other side calling the victim while he's in the house to distract him and he can come lout and do whatever he's going to do. </TEXT>
