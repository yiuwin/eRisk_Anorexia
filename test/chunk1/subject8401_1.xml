	<TEXT> I feel like you and Op are both right in this regard. Like, they serve to give background without just dumping exosition in the middle of an episode, but you should be able to understand a show reasonably well just from the show itself, and not watching additional content </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During the winter, near Christmas, we have Christmas Ville, which consists of Christmas themed activities, including a parade, and Come see me in the spring, which is a similar event, both of which feature free admission. You can read more about them Here (http://www.christmasvillerockhill.com/) and here (http://comeseeme.org/), but they are both well attended events, where one can have fun alone, as a couple, or as a family. I highly recommend checking them out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although I agree with you that she might be at a disadvantage without her weapon, she also has her semblance, speed, so at the very least she could get the hell out, and as we saw in volume two she can run fast enough for the shock waves to crack the wall. So, while she would probably lose in a straight fight at the moment, she could also probably get away easy enough. </TEXT>
