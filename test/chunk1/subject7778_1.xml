	<TEXT> Damn, this post of yours really got me thinking, thanks icanjusttypeanythi. About how we live in a period of "change" in all sorts of ways. Where using technology not necessarily means knowledge acquired by and for profession(al)s anymore, but has become a sort of enhancer for every day life.

For instance, my system camera collects dust on the shelf, I almost always use my phone. I instagram my days, and even though I certainly look for the esthetics around me, it's more of a journal-making tool to be honest. It's personal, not professional. No matter if it's grainy as shit, it's fun.

No doubt certain professions will disappear, the photographer as a profession is probably no exception of risking that. Come to think of it, I read a while back that a purse brand was planning to let their customers provide images for their next ad campaign, as they regarded the technical equipment people have within easy reach in every-day life, would be good enough. 

I guess I shouldn't be surprised, many are the professions that has disappeared into memory. I somehow never really considered "living a change" first hand, like this. And so fast! When I started working we used fonts made of glass in the very first computerized monster machines (Berthold), on light sensitive papers, that we developed in a darkroom. This we put up on a table, cut up and waxed in order for it to stick. That was the layout process. We usually didn't even see a photo, next to it, until it was printed. And back then, the old guys talked about when they started out, how they used lead fonts and proof read stuff backwards/upside down.

Today, I take a picture, write a text, lay it out on my laptop, publish it... It IS a change, and to think that things will remain the same considering the kind of times we live in, is probably not very realistic. However, I'm not entirely sure it's a bad thing. Sad to an extent, yes, but might not be bad.

Photojournalism will most likely be watered down with "people close by with a phone", if photos will be required at all in this youtube age. Art photography has always been difficult to make a living of, most that does that "work for a living" taking on all sorts of projects. I even saw a sneak-peak of an upcoming filter in Photoshop, that basically removed motion blurr, so in theory the art of keeping a camera steady, isn't even going to be a big thing. 

On the surface it sounds kind of sad, but I can't help but wonder what the drive and talent that this profession still in some manner has encapsulated in the past, will lead to in the future? New professions, new imagins, new heights of how to document the world as it progresses, perhaps even? 

I hope so at least.

Thanks again for thought provoking text, it will stay with me for a while I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, the ol' "a comics reward is getting a woman to laugh". I've always percieved that as somewhat rude to hard working comedians, to be honest. Many comedians do tell tales of how they saved themselves from bullies and similar in school by being the class clown. Making people laugh, instead of receiving a punch. This is most likely not true to everybody out there, making a living out of laughter, but it seems quite common. So I think making people laugh as a professional somewhere was about making an impression. I guess impressing women isn't excluded, but they do tend to want to impress men as well.  

Now, I've wondered why I mostly found male stand up comedians to be funnier than female. For me it was a bit of an epiphany a few years back when I realized that it ultimately was due to the discomfort of watching a woman pushing the envelope. If she too does it, who's left to be responsible? Stupidity, of course, but quite good for me to realize, so that I could kick that silly role-reflex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find it strange and somewhat disconcerting that the language signals that women are supposed to "give" sex as opposed to men who "have" it. Pardon my generalization, but it appears to me that this is some underlying notion that I almost always find in discussions like these. I wonder if the sort of situation the OP describes would be all that common, if men and women alike, were "having sex" (which in reality I think most do) instead of this, in every-day speech sounds like one party being somebody who's supposed to give something away, rather than having it? 

(I'm a bit of a language nerd, I admit, but it's interesting to analyze what kind of signals we unknowingly send out when choosing our words, and what kind of impact that has.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The most important thing, I think, is for you to realize that you can not solve your mother's issues. Even if she, in her mind, regards you as one of them. Her problems are something she has to want to deal with. So I think the first step needs to be for you to figure out how you let go of the feelings of responsibility for her, that I imagine reading between the lines.

You will be able to help yourself, if you let yourself. You are no longer 15 years old, depending on your mother, even if that emotion probably stays with you as a ghost companion through life. I know it has for me. 

I went through the process of "breaking up" with my father, who simply wasn't good for me and my state of mind. Realizing that a parent isn't what you need him/her to be, is extremely painful. But I hope that you understand that the pain deep down derives from the knowledge that you deserve better. Don't feel any shame. 

Quite simply, realize that you are not the one who is ill.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, this is true -- as it is with women as well, blurting out generelizing sexistic jokes or whatnot. I tried to explain this to a bunch of guys I hang with in a chat, the problem isn't the odd sexistic joke, it's finding yourself in a situation where you get slammed by loads of jokes which ultimately makes you feel "alright, I'm the odd one out, please continue to remind me, why don't you". I dunno, it's the ganging-up effect that gets to me personally, not the jokes. Even though I know it's meant as a joke from each individual it easily turns into a grey area of social bonding between others, where I'm providing the glue without being included. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm all for keeping a cool head, mature strategies to make the world a better place and whatnot. You don't shout revolution 'cause you wake up bored one day, change has got to be regarded seriously, I totally agree with that notion. But is it really rational to suggest that the measure of maturity in this case, is that somebody else gives you permission to object to the state of things? 

It's seems to me that rights of freedom to assembly is pitted against rights of land owners. It puts the whole protest thing into a nutshell, if you ask me, as an onlooker from Europe. Who decides which rights the police are to protect when things like this happens? Who decides if you have any rights, check the Department of Transportation..? It gives me a chill, to be honest.

It's this, the apparant clash between ownership and civil rights, that makes this whole debate so confusing. One group's rights has to take a back seat, I would assume? It sorta has to be some sort of clash, seeing how various rights are pitted against eachother? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's one of those things that really messes with my head. Why can't I be, uhm, pardon my french, horny? Put up, but don't like it, is broadcasted everywhere. Like, where men have **sexuality**, women have **responsibility**. 

I see it everywhere, how girls and women should be ashamed of themselves, when they display some sort of sexual notion--or just look sexy even, however, are shrudes if they don't "give a little" sometimes. Like sex is some frigging prize in a competition or whatnot? It's such a mood killer being the one to have to "give sex" instead of just being free to "have sex", like any normal human being.

In contrast, I also have several friends who lie awake at night wondering why their hubbies isn't interested in having sex anymore. Men, of course, also has to live up to something that necessarily isn't what they are about. It just appears that roles have been assigned way to narrowly for something that in a sense makes the world go around. 

It blows my mind how many problems that would be solved should this weird contradiction just be left in the past and become a distant memory of crazy old-days stuff. Do you know if it has some purpose that explains why it's around? 

Luckily some don't give a damn and do what comes natural to them, I applaud them, but still there are some sort of general stereotypical "thruth" that everybody has to relate to, in one way or another. It gives me the creeps. Is there anything that can be done to change this? </TEXT>

Find ways of keeping track of your daughter, don't make it entirely about what you're about, try to find ways to show that you want to know what she's about and what's going on in her life. Talking to her mother or stepfather might be one thing. Like asking for pictures and snippets of what's going on with her.

	<TEXT> I'm not sure, think it has to do with guilt. "I've agreed to do this, so I have to comply to that". It's quite common that victims of abuse blame themselves, and it's not unheard of people staying in abusive relationships for years. Kind of feeds the guilt too, doesn't it, "you're in the situation willingly, so..." Some even end up in one abusive relationship after another. Some shit in life you have to bear and grin, I suppose, in order to gain whatever, reckon we all can acknowledge that to a degree. No idea why and when that turns selfdestructive in some though.
