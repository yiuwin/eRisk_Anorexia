	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello folks, I'm usually more of a lurker in here than poster, but I was having a discussion with someone at work about the slavery and race. It was triggered by Dan Carlin's Hardcore History episode where he posited that slavery, actually, is a natural part of human society and that it was only a modern morality which has led us to attempt to rid the world of an institution which has existed for thousands of years.

It moved on to a (rather ill informed) discussion about whether or not racism was a modern phenomenon; Carlin argues that in ancient societies slavery wasn't something defined by race so much as whether or not your society was winners, and from my (vague) memory in Rome colour wasn't a bar to succeeding so much as status and wealth. Slavery as an institution involving purely people from one colour is something which appeared purely with the arrival of Europeans in Africa. 

Am I completely wrong, particularly in the last bit? Please feel free to shoot me down or refer me to some good reading on this

TL; DR: Ancient slave societies didn't select slaves according to colour, it was a modern phenomenon. Discuss.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Valdes has only made more than two saves in a match once this season, against Sevilla where he made three.

In eight La Liga games, he has made less than two saves, in four of then he hasn't even made one. On average Barcelona have faced only 1.58 shots on target per game while the average team concedes 4.49 shots.

So far, there isn't one goalkeeper in La Liga who has allowed less shots on average, per game, than Valdes; not even Riesgo from Osasuna who has played only 45 minutes all season.

I guess this pays tribute to both the quality of Barca's ball winners and their ability to retain possession.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From Saracens.com
Now that all discussions between various stakeholders have been concluded, Saracens has decided the Heineken Cup match against Biarritz on Saturday January 14th will be played not in Cape Town, but in London.

The innovative English champion club was eager to host the first Heineken Cup match ever played outside Europe, to stage a special, spectacular rugby event and to project brilliant images of Cape Town and European rugby around the world. However, we have no wish to be a catalyst for conflict between the City of Cape Town and the Western Province Rugby Union.

Saracens looks forward to playing a competitive match in Cape Town as soon as local circumstances allow.

Supporters who have bought tickets in South Africa will be fully refunded by Computicket, and Saracens will engage with UK-based supporters who have already booked air tickets and accommodation, and ensure they are appropriately compensated.

Hopefully that "competitive game" is in the LV Cup.  </TEXT>

Quote:
Nov. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Lithuanias banking regulator said hundreds of millions of dollars in assets may be missing from Bankas Snoras AB after the government took over the Baltic nations fifth-biggest lender on concern it may be insolvent.

More than 1 billion litai ($392 million) of assets may be unaccounted for, central bank Governor Vitas Vasiliauskas told reporters yesterday in the capital, Vilnius. Snorass operations were halted until Nov. 21 and a state administrator appointed after the lender ignored recommendations to reduce its credit risk, the regulator said in a statement.

The Baltic region is recovering from the worst recession in the European Union, during which Latvia sought an international bailout after rescuing Parex Banka AS to protect it against a run on deposits. With 19.4 billion litai in foreign-currency reserves, Lithuania can handle the takeover of Snoras, the countrys largest locally owned bank, according to AB DnB Bankas economist Jekaterina Rojaka.

This isnt a systemic problem for the banking sector, Rojaka said yesterday in a telephone interview from Vilnius. Still, the situation requires speedy and smooth action to contain panic and prevent a fall in government bonds.

Lithuanias 10-year dollar bond declined yesterday, sending the yield 4 basis points higher to 6.26 percent, the highest since Oct. 14.

Moving Funds

Snoras is 68.1 percent-owned by Vladimir Antonov, a 36- year-old Russian who resides primarily in London and is the controlling shareholder of Portsmouth Football Club, with a 75 percent stake.

The central bank acted after Snoras began moving funds to offshore accounts this week, Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said in a radio interview with Ziniu Radijas today.

The banks takeover is the cheapest method to protect the Lithuanian banking system and prevent a bold attack against it, President Dalia Grybauskaite told reporters in Vilnius today.

The governments decision is a robbery, which will have painful consequences for the country, said Raimondas Baranauskas, the banks chief executive officer and owner of a 25.31 percent stake, according to newspaper Lietuvos Rytas, which is 34-percent owned by a Snoras subsidiary.

Minimal Costs

The takeover wont have a substantial effect on the economy because this is a problem of one bank and its possible to solve the problem with minimal costs for taxpayers, Finance Minister Ingrida Simonyte told LNK television yesterday.

Kubilius said he doesnt plan to ask the International Monetary Fund or other international lenders for financial help.

I have no doubt Lithuania will manage the situation without requiring aid from international institutions, Grybauskaite said.

Snoras, which competes with Scandinavian lenders including SEB AB, Swedbank AB and Nordea AB, also controls investment bank Finasta and Latvian lender Latvijas Krajbanka AS. It held 6.05 billion litai in deposits and had assets of 8.14 billion litai at the end of September, according to the Lithuanian Banking Association. The government guarantees bank deposits of up to 100,000 euros each.

Protect Interests

The decision was taken to effectively protect the interests of the banks clients and the public interest to ensure confidence in the domestic banking system and its stability, the central bank said.

The lender is unauthorized to provide comments and all requests should be directed to the central bank, Snoras spokeswoman Virginija Zygiene said in a telephone interview yesterday.

Snoras ignored the instructions of the Bank of Lithuania to reduce operational risks and made no changes to its business activities following advice from the central bank, the regulator said.

The lender also avoided providing information needed for the supervisory purposes, according to the central bank, which said there are indications that information submitted to the supervisory institution was false.

The Prosecutor Generals office started an investigation into Snorass operations, it said in a statement on its website. No indictments have yet been made, it added.

Antonov was barred from investing in Swedens Saab Automobile AB in July by the European Investment Bank, which didnt give a reason for its decision.

The U.K.s Financial Services Authority denied Snoras permission to operate in Britain because the banks executives withheld information, calling the tactic an ongoing pattern of behavior by institutions controlled by Mr. Antonov in a February 2009 statement.

Antonovs spokeswoman, Natalja Olesik, declined to immediately comment when contacted by e-mail yesterday.

TLDR: Bank owned by Portsmouth owner has been taken over by government due to fears about liquidity. Bank was refused licence to trade in UK due to lack of info </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know whether any of you followed Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu's meltdown on twitter in which Farrell's dig of "whinge about it on twitter" hit home, and ended with EFS calling Farrell an arrogant shit, but Faz Jnr's response to winning AP Player of the Month is to give his prize money to one of the two charities that Saracens heavily support

Fwiw: I've never seen anything from young Faz to suggest he's anything other than a complete pro, but that might just be my blinkered Sarries supporting eyes.

Also: this might just be Saracens PR department doing its job, but either way, good on Faz.  </TEXT>
