	<TITLE> Is religion a biological trait of humans, or a meme? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's probably somewhere in the middle, but which one is it closer to?

By "biological trait", I mean the belief in God or gods is inherited, and can be explained by an aspect of brain structure encoded by our DNA. A group of people isolated from our society would still develop religion.

By "meme", I mean there is nothing about our brain structure that makes religion inevitable. It's something that people learn when they see others learning it. A group of people isolated from our society would not develop religion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is that actually true? The [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/aboutfunding.jsp) has an [entire division](https://www.nsf.gov/mps/dms/about.jsp) funding math research. They support a lot of abstract math, which covers stats that don't have immediate application.

Regardless, this falls under science, which as a whole gets a lot more attention than philosophy. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why did philosophy never become as dominant as religion and science? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I understand that the lines between these three are often blurred, but even so, it's hard to miss that philosophy isn't as mainstream as religion and science. 84% of the human population identifies with a religion. But if you ask a random person whether they identify as a utilitarian or deontologist, you'll probably get a confused look or a vague, middling answer. Each year, governments invest billions of dollars in scientific research: much of it theoretical and with little application. How much funding does philosophical research get?

I see philosophy as having the same goal as religion and science: to find the truth, and to use it to explain the world. But it hasn't been popularized the same way. Why? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Has Eastern Europe always been poorer than Western Europe, and if so, why? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Usually, when this question is asked, the response is that WWII and the Cold War ruined Eastern Europe, or that the agricultural and industrial revolutions began in Britain and not in Eastern Europe.

But a while ago I ran into [this interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2kf3qq/why_didnt_the_romans_conquer_poland_or_eastern/) about the Romans in Eastern Europe:
The Romans were mostly interested in conquering areas that had a high degree of self sufficiency which could provide a tax base for them to extract from. Poland and eastern europe (as well as parts of Germany) did not have the higher level of urbanism at this time as in comparison with some Celtic Gallic settlements, which were in many ways already integrated into the Roman trade network in the case of southern Gaul.

This is interesting because it shows that the wealth divide between Eastern and Western Europe existed long before the modern era. I'm thinking the USSR isn't the reason why the non-Balkan east is poor, so from a wider historical perspective, what's the real reason? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there a better form of government than democracy? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-11 06:21:04 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I was recently reading about Fukuyama's book [*The End of History*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man), which claims that there will be no new form of government after Western liberal democracy. Like a lot of people I'm not a big fan of this idea -- it feels egotistical and usually people who try to predict the future this way are wrong. But it got me thinking: if democracy will eventually die, what better form of government will come around to replace it?

I guess it's not guaranteed that what replaces democracy will be better, but it's likely. Countries and governments rise and fall based on natural selection. The governments that best create internal stability, a strong military, and an efficient economy will survive and outlive other governments. A successor to democracy would have to do these things better than democracy.

I definitely don't think democracy is flawless. There is a level of danger in giving political power to an uninformed people. The average Joe doesn't know classified info, and doesn't know the details of policy. The average Joe is also going to value short-term personal benefit over long-term societal benefit. If you ask me, I'd say democracy gives a little too much power to the people. But I'm wondering what the rest of you think. </TEXT>
