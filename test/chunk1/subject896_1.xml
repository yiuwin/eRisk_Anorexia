	<TEXT> She is incredibly unorganized, and never follows through with anything. Our office staff and our mutual patients are very frustrated with her. She has one case that needs his final denture (before a trip in 2 weeks). She'd been avoiding his calls and never returns them. Today she attempted to explain to our staff as to why she'd "been having trouble" contacting him. It was all due to Mars being in retrograde and it was messing with her phone. 

Bullshit.

	<TITLE> What act of kindness/humanitarianism have you performed that brought you hate and malcontent? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-07-02 17:57:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's my story:

As I pull into the parking lot at my office, I notice that some of our work kitties (feral cats in the neighborhood that we set out food and water for) are playing with something. As I get closer I realize that they've caught a mouse. No big deal. That's what cats do best. I own two little furry karma machines myself.

Then I notice that they're not hunting it, they're just playing with it. The mouse is clearly fighting for it's life and giving these two cats everything it's got. The little guy's got moxie. Since the cats are merely toying with it, I decide to take it's fate in my hands and attempt to give it a second chance by shooing the would-be killers away.

Doesn't work. They grab the mouse in their jaws and carry it off. Sigh... Oh well. Sorry, little guy.

About an hour later I notice the same two cats with the same mouse. They've been fucking with it for over an hour now and I see my second chance at a rescue mission. I know, it's just one little mouse, but since I failed it the first time around, I'm even more determined to save it this time.

I run out to scare the cats away, and the mouse is too exhausted to run anymore. I put on gloves (I work in a dental office) and scoop the little guy up and move him to the other side of the building and place him in amongst some shrubbery. Mission Accomplished. Hopefully, he'll recover.

I get back inside where some of my coworkers were watching by the window and (the bitch of the office) tells me that I'm stupid for saving a goddamned mouse, and that she hopes I die of disease from touching it.

TL;DR I rescued a mouse from a couple of cats at work and a coworker told me I was stupid and that she hopes I die of mouse-ridden disease.

What act of kindness/humanitarianism have you performed that instead  brought you abhorrence and malcontent? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-06-08 04:27:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is an email from my father's girlfriend who lives in Juarez, Mexico. They get by with his terrible Spanglish in person, and when communicating via email, Google Translate is the way to go. Unfortunately, Google has a hard time with slang, typos, and misspellings. Usually, it's a regular discussion and I wouldn't be seeking your help but the Translator pulled up some troubling keywords like "kidnapped" and "extortion". 

I would greatly appreciate help in translating her message:

Any suggestions? Price range: $20-$60

From what I've been told he likes a full, thick, round flavor. Woody, but not too smokey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reek/Theon has been through so much since his betrayal of the Starks. I thought I'd never forgive him, and couldn't wait to see him die. But after ADWD, I can't help but feel a bit sorry for him. I'm not saying that he is forgiven, but it does seem that he is atoning. Don't forget what Jaime did to Bran. And we all love Jaime now.

TL;DR: Does anyone else feel bad for Reek/Theon or do you still hate his guts? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> HBO cheapens itself in Episode 7, You Win or You Die (Spoilers) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-05-25 20:53:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Did anyone else think that the lesbian scene in Littlefingers whore house was unnecessary and cheap? I mean, Im all for sex, and theres plenty of it in the book series. I was prepared for HBO to ramp up the sex factor, and even prepared for a Loras and Renly love scene, albeit jokingly, but after watching the early premiere for Episode 7 I felt like they went beyond their usual tawdry self. 

While the scene lasted about 5 minutes, most of it was completely unnecessary. I understand the need for Littlefinger to give us some back story on his [TV Spoiler](/s "Catelyn Tully crush and the battle against her betrothed"), but play with her ass while hes mid-sentence in revealing his lost love story? Too much. Give us a minute of back story and instead of 4 minutes of lesbian boobage, you give us direwolves (remember them?) or explain why [TV Spoiler](/s "Dany is eating a horse heart"). You know, actual story. 
	
In my opinion that scene was there strictly for the girl-on-girl action. It was forced, cheap, and changed my views toward the show. HBO, there is plenty of sex in the series; you really dont need to add any more. The intelligence and grace of the books are slowly being lost thanks to this kind of directing. If I wanted to watch porn, Id go watch porn and I sure as hell wouldnt pay $15 a month for it. Im paying to see my favorite book series come to life as no other network could produce and theyre bringing it down to the level of True Blood. Seriously, HBO? Have some class. These arent Twilight fans youre dealing with; we expect more.

Im sure some of my male counterparts may disagree with my feelings on this, and thats to be expected. I was just disappointed with HBOs need to flaunt sex so desperately that they would forego any real story telling. The books are hard enough to condense; you would think that they would want to put in as much detail as possible. But no time for that! MOAR BOOBS!

Other than that particular scene, I loved the episode.

If HBO decides to keep adding cheap sex scenes instead of showing all the amazing things in the book that they had to cut (in order to fit in the cheap sex scenes), I might have to cancel my subscription. 

(Id probably still watch, but HBO can kiss my money goodbye if they're not going to do it justice.)
