	<TEXT> Yeah, you are right, i  didn't ment to say that that sort of things happen everytime, but there were situations where Croats stoned Serbian cars, or Serbians breaking windows of Croatian shops in Serbia. I just hope that better times are comming for our national relationship, and that someday we could ignore stupid things that happened in the past and move on together with cooperation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Croatia really is a beautiful country, and it is not true that people there kill every stranger that they see, it is a common opinion of people that do not know Balkan history. But there is a mutual hatred with Serbians and Croats though, which is a shame, because i really want to visit Croatia, and I can't, because i really could get killed or stabbed or something, not saying that Serbs would not do the same if they see a Croat in their country...  Yup, we are really fucked up people, makes me wanna hate living here... </TEXT>
