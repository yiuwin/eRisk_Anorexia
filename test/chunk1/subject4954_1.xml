	<TEXT> Novation makes some good options for tweaking with sounds, like the Bass Station II. But if you're willing to spend a bit more money, I'd buy a Moog Sub Phatty used and you'll have fun for years tweaking around and learning analog sound synthesis by pure experimentation. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> New songwriting idea: Title first? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-02 21:47:28 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I'm wondering if anyone else has tried this, and if so, to what outcome.

For quite a while I've followed the same general songwriting formulas, in order of frequency: (1) I come up with a musical idea, maybe a riff or a chord progression, which I flesh out, expand on, and then eventually add melody and lyrics, or (2) I get a melody in my head; I work out the musical accompaniment, then struggle with lyrics.

Both of these processes place so much pressure on coming up with the right lyrical hook after all of the rest of the songwriting is done. And it typically starts with the same all-encompassing question: what is this song going to be about? Select from the following list:

- love
- loss
- fear of death
- that one really cool time, that one summer
- that inspiring story about that one girl
- how much I want to dance, and like, right now

Just a few weeks ago as I was re-thinking the process, I realized that I could turn the process on its head, and start with the song title. And every time since when I've heard an interesting phrase, or a novel topic came into my head, I started writing them down in a list. My intention is to start the songwriting process by picking a title from the list I'm excited about and, informed by that, working out the melody and musical arrangement. I'm excited about the possibility of diving into new songs without having to face the black box of not knowing what it will be about or, as a literal matter, say.

Given how big this community is, I'm guessing this is a technique that has been utilized by many. Thoughts?

	<TEXT> Nice job! The groove kind of reminds me of the Doors. Has a great vibe and got stuck in my head. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice vocals and I like the sparse arrangement. For my tastes, the video used a bit too much aerial drone footage and it seemed a bit gimmicky, but overall this shows promise. </TEXT>
