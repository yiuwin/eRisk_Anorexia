	<TEXT> What is a Cortado? It looks more in line with an after dinner drink.

My guess: 1 part cold espresso, 4 parts whole milk, both steamed, finished with a dab of frothed milk. Seems very straw - worthy.

If it's not anything like what I just described , I'm going to try mine out tomorrow morning, top it with a hint of salt and call it "Caffe di Aqua Salata".  mmmmmm... maybe. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-12-11 01:23:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I noticed something between s1e7 Raising Gazorpazorp and s1e8 Rixty Minutes; at the end of e7 where Morty is trying to council Morty Jr. into different possibilities to vent his frustrations in a more constructive manner other than destroying everything, and Brad Anderson walks up and talks about creating Marmaduke dealing with his uncontrollable urge to mutilate and sexually assault on a daily basis. Anderson tells Morty Jr. to become a creative and says he channels these thoughts into his daily work.  Morty Jr. Bounds off after realizing he wants to see his face on the back of a book.

Jim Davis is the creator of Garfield, and has always sited Brad Anderson as being an inspiration for the creation of Garfield. On e8 Rixty Minutes, there is a show on Ricks upgraded cable box that is a total ripoff of Garfield called "[Gazorpazorpfield...Gimmie My Darn Enchiladas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_LJtG2gXSc)". Not only are they Gazorpazorps but Gazorparorpfield hates John to the point where he wants to kill him and calls him Bitch just like Morty Jr.  I think Morty Jr. was the creator of that cartoon.

On a side note: when Gazorpazorpfield calls John a Bitch kicks over Johns coffee and says Now gimmie my fucking enchiladas. Roiland cant contain himself.

	<TEXT> If I were to get my food prep license in the state of TN, is there a way to rent a kitchen to cook my food without all the inspection rigamarole? I see that there are kitchens to rent in Nashville and Knoxville, but none in Memphis.  Is there a way to get involved with a commercial kitchen?  I don't think the only way to cook food for the consumption of the masses are through buying your own commercial kitchen.

Cooking meat
Making bread

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a semi-professional espresso machine that I have been using for six years. I have basically modified my tamp and grind but never modified the pressure.  My machine's green line/zone is between 1000-1200 mlb or 1.0-1.2 bars.  It redlines at 2000 mlb or 2.0 bars.  What is/are the repercussions of me operating this at say 1.7 bars?  I can't seem to find any info on this.  

Machine:  Sanremo Treviso

Grinder:    Rancilio </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, I want to say that I had the most amazing chicken today.  I was at a very nice office Christmas lunch which consisted of lamb, salmon and chicken. Take a pick, take all The only thing I want to touch on is the chicken.  This chicken was a sliced breast with a cranberry sauce and fingerling potatoes.  I could cut into this chicken with a spoon, literally.  It was the supplest piece of chicken I have ever eaten so I caught the chef in a hallway.  I asked if it was pressure cooked.  He said it is/was confit.  Overnight brined with aromatics and cooked in duck fat for six hours at 300 degrees F.  He said he keeps the fat for the next dinner and it gets better with use.

My questions are:  Do you store the duck fat in a fridge after cooking it?   Where can I find info about this technique? Do I put the chicken in the crock pot and then fill it with the fat?  How do I do this?

	<TEXT> Every once in a while, I'll unsleep my phone and notice that my location delta up in the right top corner is on.  Something in my phone is wanting to know my location.  Is there a way to access what program is using this function uncommanded?  There is a app wanting to know where I'm at even though it's not in use.  It goes away after about two seconds after I wake up the phone. I feel a little violated by this.  Any ideas?

Thanks!
