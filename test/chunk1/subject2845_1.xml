	<TEXT> My best friend and long time college roommate was bullied in High school. People used to call her smeagol and tell her she was ugly. Well, in college she was smoking hot and she dated and slept with a lotttttt of shitty guys, most of them really good looking assholes. They all treated her terribly, as did many of the other female friends she had in college. We're still very close, and have since graduated. But I still attribute many of her (still current) actions to her High school experiences. Her self esteem is just rock bottom and there's no reason. She is literally one of the hottest girls I've ever seem </TEXT>

I'm fairly new to this subreddit and I've been lurking on all these fabulous stories quite a bit. I figured it was time to share one of my own. Let me start out by saying this story is true, although I frequently find myself wishing it wasn't. It's been a few years now, so forgive me if the details are a bit blurry.

I was seventeen, maybe eighteen. Either in my last semester of my senior year of high school, or freshly into the excitement that is the summer after graduation. Regardless, I was with my boyfriend of two years. We were driving a route we commoned that was between my parents' house and his. I was driving the little five-speed '93 toyota tercel that I had at the time, and we were driving down the 'speedtrap hill' that was famous at my high school. At the bottom of the hill was a rather large pond that some of my naughtier friends and I used to smoke weed at pretty regularily. Across the street from the pond was a half built, deserted luxury subdivision called 'the shire.' It was all lord of the rings themed, and it was a common 'meet up' place for friends. ANYWAY, on this particular night (it was probably around 12am) my boyfriend and I were driving down the hill and all of a sudden I saw a light up ahead, in the woods by the side of the road. It wasn't just a light though, it was moving. I at first attributed it to being tired, but as we got closer the figure got more defined. It looked like a small deer, or maybe a large dog, and it was glowing white. It moved across the street, but not in a way that I've ever seen an animal move before. It sort of galloped, or bucked. The only way I can describe it is, when I was seven I witnessed a baby bunny eat poisoned grass and die of a seizure. That's exactly what the glowing deer animal was doing. It flopped and seized into the street, all the while still glowing. (Mind you, there are no street lights in this area at all) After it reached the middle of the street, it retreated, flopping back into the woods. I cannot describe the utter terror and foreboding I felt the second this 'thing' appeared. It looked like it was in terrible pain and it was definitely not living. After it left my boyfriend and I sat in silence until he said 'Please tell me you saw that, alison.'

I have avoided that route ever since, and I still have dreams about that creature. I will never know what it was and every logical explination I can think of just doesn't make sense.

	<TEXT> When I was six, the lion king came out. It was my favorite movie but my parents got kind of worried because when scar died, I would hide in their closet and cry for like half an hour. Scar was my favorite character and I loved him. And every time I would come right back out after crying and want to watch it again. To this day I still sympathize with him. He has to have a heart in there somewhere!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, that helps a lot! I figured I would lean more toward St. Petersburg, but it's mostly wherever he wants to go seeing as this is his part of the trip. 
And it's funny you mentioned the fact that perhaps Russians aren't too keen on Germans because I said something to him about it as well. He's been there before though, so he seems pretty confident. We'll see though, thanks for all the advice!! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Russian History and what to see in Russia? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-01-09 18:22:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a huge history buff, primarily European history. I read a lot on it, but have wanted to broaden my horizons a bit (it gets a bit redundant once your on your sixth book about napoleon or who be it- lol.) My boyfriend is from Germany and this summer I will be traveling there to visit him. I only get 2 weeks vacation from my work, so we're going to be on a bit of a time constraint and I know that I will not be able to go to even half the places I would like, in the area. Now, the place my boyfriend is set on going is Russia. Personally, Russia has not held that much interest in my mind but I believe that is mostly based on the fact that I don't know much about the history. I know the more I learn about the country as a whole, the more excited I will be to go there. My question is: what are, in your opinion, the most important historical events in Russia for me to learn about before traveling there? And what cities hold the most historical relevance? I know it's a huge country with what I can only assume is a gargantuan amount of history so I really don't know where to begin! Thanks so much in advance for your help! I want to be as excited as he is when we go there. </TEXT>
