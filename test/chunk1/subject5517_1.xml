	<TEXT> Yeah, it was pretty scary seeing her freak out on something that wasn't visible to anyone else. And I've always heard that cats are more attuned to the paranormal, so she could probably sense it a lot stronger than I did and felt or maybe even saw it. I could only perceive the things it did, the noises and such and sometimes feel its presence. I was really grateful when I finally got to get out of their, because whatever that was, a spirit, a demon, a ghost, seemed to be getting more and more malignant as time passed. I don't know what would have happened if we'd stayed much longer, once the shadows started moving.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of it was rather typical of haunted houses, honestly. Like every time I walked in front of the bathroom mirror, I would get very cold and every hair on my body would stand on end and I would feel like I had just fallen 200 feet and I would just get this sense of *dread* and freeze and then run the hell away from there once I could move again. 

Random objects would be moved around, out of place, as if moved when no one was home. 

My cat would meow at things that didn't seem to be there, growl and hiss and claw at the *thing* no one else could see. 

I would experience sleep paralysis, which never happened again  after I moved out so I wonder if maybe it was something to do with the haunting, not just the common neurological phenomenon.

As time progressed, I would wake up with strange wounds on my body, scratches and bruises with no source I could remember. 

Sometimes I would hear tapping coming from inside the mirror.

I would hear whispers that I couldn't make out, sounding as if coming from from underwater, but also like they were above me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to live in a house that I believe was 'haunted'. Sometimes I would hear loud, heavy footsteps like big feet clad in waders and and the whistling of som sort of toon, a rather nonchalant one. Whenever I would go towards the sound, the footsteps would retreat and the whistling would fade. Many strange things happened in that house though, besides that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what worked for me and it can all be done in your own home with no need for any equipment-

Planking Workout: http://imgur.com/C8w7BjE

Wall-sits: 1 minute and then increasing as I got stronger (this one was the hardest to increase the duration of, so it took more time for me anyway) 

Walking, just pacing around my home: 30-90 minutes.

Crunches: Started out with 50 than worked up to 250 with time

Jumping Jacks: 1 minute than worked up to 5 minutes

Yoga: My favorites are Warrior pose and Tree pose as well as Chair pose, and I would alternate these for 30 minutes, and add in some new ones if I got bored with those ones

I would just do all that once a day and I lost 16 pounds over the course of about 4 or 5 months. 16 pounds may not sound like a lot depending on your own body but I'm only 5 feet tall so that was actually a significant amount of weight off of my frame. 

Now I just do planks and crunches and wall-sits for a total of 10 minutes a day and that's enough to maintain where I'm at now. 

Good luck(: </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All I asked was if there was a way to get around the policy. That is all. That is not attention seeking, it is asking a question. The answer seems to be no, so I need to just get used to whatever is wrong with me. 

And actually, yeah, it is harm. The emotional kind, the kind that really matters. I'd rather suffer physical discomfort than more psychological trauma.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not so much a law, but just a thing. I'm too young to consent to medical or psychological care and my family refuses to let me see a male therapist because of sexist views and stereotypes but in place by an unfair society and it seems a lot of male therapists won't take in female minor patient due to 'liability issues'. 

I can't just get someone I trust, because the only person I trust is way too far away to accompany me, and I *can't* be 100% sure nothing will happen because I *know* that the stupid policy of the female nurse being there will be used and so a female medical professional will be there watching everything happen and *that is harm to me*. 

I value my emotional health more than my physical health.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm worried a male nurse wouldn't count, beens this seems to be such a sexist policy. And also because I'm a minor I can't legally make my own medical decisions so I can't just go looking for a place that would work. I can't drive yet and I have no money and I would need parental consent anyway and my parents would just make me see which ever doctor is available closest and wouldn't even care that I don't want a female present and they might actually insist upon it, probably making me see a female doctor :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im probably just going to have to wait it out. I can't handle being seen like that by a female, especially one in the medical profession. And I don't think Xanax would even help that much, like I'd still be *conscious*, and I'd still know I was being looked at by the female and I'd still experience it as a trauma, probably not much better than when I was actually molested and I'm just not strong so I just can't handle that. It's not worth the emotional distress. Hopefully whatever it is isn't fatal :/

There's really no way to get around having a female in the room? Couldn't I just refuse that and sign some waver thing or something? I'm kind of desperate. I really need medical attention but l can't get it if there's no way around that... </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-11-19 00:38:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok...so. The background for my problem is that last year I was molested by a female doctor and it has left me terrified of other females and doctors. I know that's not rational but it's jut what I'm stuck with now.

So...the problem is that, physically speaking (well, psychologically too, with the flashbacks, nightmares, ever-inconvenient fear of my own gender and doctors, ect, but that's not what this is about) I am a mess. I get dizzy every time I stand up, I have very frequent headaches, abdominal pain, random nausea, unbearablly heavy periods and painful periods with cramp so bad I throw up, but this month I've missed it completely, and most concerning is that a few days ago I found this weird, long, hard, bumpy, painful tube-y lump in my groin. At first it only hurt when I touched it but now it's just hurting no matter what and it's really worrying me. I know I need to see a doctor about my symptoms but I can't because 1) even if I manage to find a male doctor, there is this rediculous policy that if a male doctor is seeing a female patient there _has_ to be a _female_ nurse in the room the whole time, and I can't handle that. I'm not sure if this policy is universal or just regional or maybe it's just because I'm a minor but I was wondering if anyone else has had this policy used with them and if there is a way around it? I'll be so distressed already just being in a medical facility (I panic even if I'm just in a waiting room, even if I'm not even the one getting the medical stuff done, it's the smell, the sight, the coldness that triggers my flashbacks) so I can't even image how torn up I'll be over being examined even by a male doctor but it will just push me over the edge if there has to be a female in the room. I know that's illogical but I cannot emotionally handle being near female medical staff. I need it to just be myself and a male doctor, but there is that policy. I really feel like there is something wrong with my body and it needs treatment.
Is there a way around this policy? Or is just a local thing? Has anyone else even _heard_ of this policy? Or is just common-place, standard? And most importantly is there a way to refuse it? Also, any suggestions as to what may be wrong would be wonderful. Thank you for reading.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm going to apologize ahead, as this will likely be very jumbled but I need to talk about it

So...I have been sexually abused multiple times by multiple people and I have nightmares and flashbacks regarding those events and it's just very frustrating. I don't understand how I'm suppose to cope with that. I feel like I'm just so ruined. Ruined and filthy and impure and disgusting and repulsive and just broken. 

I *hate* that the people who hurt me *know my body*. It is wrong. It is wrong for anyone but myself and my soulmate to know my body. I just...god. I *hate* being so violated. And I feel like it's so strange that I'm more upset about being *seen* by the people who hurt me that's by being being touched. I cannot stand my ruined body that is known by so many. 

I hate that so many have forced access to my body against my will. I hate that I'll probably never be able to have a normal relationship because being physical like that will be triggering to my flashbacks. 

I am terrified of the entire female gender (I was hurt by mostly females), I can't see doctors or any thing like that because one of the people who hurt me was a doctor, I am constantly disgusted by my body. I feel like I don't even own *my own fucking body*. Like I am the possession of the people who hurt me. 

I hate crying myself to sleep every night. I hate being in a body that is permanent ruined and dirty and violated. 

Thank you for reading. It so much easier to write about it online that to talk about it in person. Less humiliating and relieves a lot of pressure.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If someone says that they never want to have kids, most of the time they will be met with replies like "You'll change your mind someday", "You only think that because your young", "How could anyone *not* want kids!?!?", "You must be so selfish!", "You're not a real women/man if you don't have kids!" ect.
But on the other hand...
If someone were to say that they do want kids, and someone were to reply "You'll change your mind someday" or "You're so selfish" almost everyone would act like whoever had said that was a monster. 
Why is that? Why is it ok to shame one group of people for their life choice, but not the other? It shouldn't be ok for anyone to shame anyone for a choice that is only one's own to make. So why do people who have or who plan to have kids get to shame those who choose to be child free? But if a child free person tried to shame someone who chose to have kids, everyone would act like that person was crazy? How did this double-standard come to be, and why is it considered so wrong to not want to have kids?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So...it's been quite a while since I last posted as I had no way of doing so, and in that time I found that moving in to live with my aunt instead of my mother...was *the worst decision of my life*. I quickly found that she is far worse than my mother. I always thought that when my mother was talking about how crazy and evil my aunt was that she was just projecting...but I have found that in the horrible almost-year I was living with her that she is the most evil human being I have ever met. She was so cruel...apparently the only reason she wanted me to live with her was so I could be the scapegoat. Her 4 children were treated like royalty and I was constantly beaten, verbally assaulted, violated, and had most of my personal belongings stolen away and *thrown away*. Garbage bags full of my clothes, my bracelets, many of my shoes, scarves, hats...
one time when I purged she cut off my hair...almost all of my hair, just because I have an illness...at least 14 inches of the hair that I had been growing out for years, chopped off and swept into the trash just because I had an eating disorder I was struggling with...that was the first time I had purged in weeks...I had been doing so well, but it was never acknowledged when I was strong enough not to, just when I messed up...
I wasn't allowed to act like myself. I had to pretend to be happy, calm, I had to pretend that I didn't care what I looked like and that I wasn't shy and I had to act like I was a part of their religion and I had to act like I didn't miss the people she had prevented me from talking to, I couldn't wear the type of clothes that make me comfortable or in my favorite color or even in my _size_ (all of the pants she made me wear were so much too small they were physically painful to wear and didn't cover up my ass all the way)...I had to act like I had no emotions at all...it was frustrating and painful...
She would constantly humiliate me, for no reason other than to humiliate me...she wouldn't allow me to shave, but would force me to wear short sleeves so everyone could see. she wouldn't let me wear a bra but would force me to wear very thin shirts that didn't actually hide my chest just to humiliate me... she would watch me shower, making me take off my clothes while she watched, not letting me get behind the curtain first...when ever I cried she would punch the side of my head so hard the edges of my vision would turn black...
she wouldn't let me speak to *anyone*, I was all alone...
I wasn't allowed to use *lotion* so my skin was flaking and red and so dry it felt like scales, I wasn't allowed to wash my face so I was in horrible condition, I wasn't allowed to trim my nails...

I'm doing a bit better now that I'm no longer living with her...I've finally gotten to get back into contact with the people she wouldn't let me speak to...my boyfriend, my best friends, my brother...and I can act and look like myself again, I've dyed my hair red and I have bangs again, I get to wear decent clothes, I get to shave, I get to wear a bra (I had no idea how much I actually love wearing a bra until I had to run around without one *in public*) and I don't have to pretend to be someone I'm not...it helps to not be alone anymore, and that I'm away from her so she's no longer hurting me...
It's hard to talk about it but it helps. I'm so happy to have this place where it's ok to talk about it...I just needed to vent. it truly does help....
But I was also wondering, has anyone else noticed a pattern of traits like this running in families? it seems odd to have both an N-mother and an N-aunt...it makes me worry about talking about it though, like maybe people won't believe that I've been hurt by multiple people in my family... 
and also...I worry I'm over-reacting...she would always say that she wasn't doing anything wrong, that what she was doing to me was my fault...that I deserve it and it wasn't wrong...is that true? are those things really not a big deal..? 
thank you for reading, I'm sorry it's so ramble-y and disorganized... </TEXT>

But the feeling persists and soon you realize it is rhythmic, steady...like breathing. You discard the idea, telling yourself it is just a stray lock of hair, so you reach up to brush it away., only to find that your fingers are met by another set, cold as death and sickeningly, unnaturally smooth like sea glass. You feel the fingers wrap around your throat and another preternatural hand slides down over your face, the fingers' jagged splinters of nails tearing at your eyes, the palm covering your mouth and the entity owning the hands pulls you smoothly into darkness. The sickening sensation of falling washes over you and you feel your lungs filling with a thick, cold liquid. The creature's tongue against your neck is the last thing you will ever feel before the nightmarish monster slashes your throat with the sinister teeth of a predator.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok, so I *did* finally get away from her I'm still upset about **alot** of things, and will be for a very long time. One if those things is her *insisting* that I'm a sociopath, psychopath, and don't care about anyone and hate all people. None of that is true. at all.
But what's most frustrating is that she shows so many characteristics of sociopathy! She's extremely manipulative, lacks empathy, lacks meaningful relationships, and does everything for her own benefit, even if other are hurt by it. Im not saying she *is* a sociopath, because I'm not qualified to make a diagnosis of any mental illness, but she does show sighs of it. 
Oh!! and how she thinks she *is* qualified to diagnos mental illnesses!! like how she insists that I'm a sociopath and psychopath and OCD and bulimic, as well as have Antisocial personality disorder. Even though I have had *three* different psychiatrists diagnose me as having social anxiety, anorexia, and nothing else. 
But she *did* convince them that I *do* have OCD, which is rediculous as I don't have an obsession or compulsive behavior or ritual, and it's upsetting when mental health professionals try to"help" with my "OCD" that they only think I have because she lied about things she says I do to make them believe (oh look, manipulation!) when I should be getting help for things I actually have.
She ignores things like that the only reason I'm alive is because of the people I ***care about***. 
But no, I'm a manipulative, sociopathic, OCD, little bitch who hates everyone

TL;DR My Nmother thinks she's a fucking mental health professional and has diagnosed me as having sociopathy, psychopathy, OCD, and antisocial personality disorder, despite *actual* mental health professionals saying otherwise </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Im finally free of my Nmother! A few days ago everything blew up and my Egrandmother decide that in order to keep me from calling the police again an maybe getting my Nmother in legal trouble, that it would be best to send me to live with my aunt, who agreed to let me stay with her. I'm upset that alot of why I got out is because my Egm was protecting my Nmother though, but at least I'm not being abused constantly anymore.  
Now that I'm no longer living with her, I think I'm going to tell my therapist about the abuse. Last session I told a little about the emotional abuse, but not the worst of what she's done. 
Also, I'm already doing a bit better now that I'm away from her! I'm feeling less like I need to rely on my eating disorder, so eating normally is getting easier and I'm weight restored and it doesn't make me feel bad to know that. I feel less anxious too. 
Im a bit nervous about this though just because it's so different. Now I'm living in a tiny apartment with 6 other people in a really large city right by the ocean, as opposed to the little farm town of less than 3,000 people I used to live in. I like it here though, beens I don't really like rural areas. And even more so because I'm away from my Nmother.
Hopefully everything keeps going well. 
It's really amazing how much less miserable everything is as soon as a narcissistic presence is gone. 
I feel like I can actually breathe </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is going to be very rambly and unorganized so I'm sorry and please bare with me. I just really need to vent and get a little advice if possible. 

Alright...I was raped 6 years ago when i was 8 years old. The raped was done by a women in my family and it made me terrified of the entire gender. 
about a month ago I was Admitted into inpatient anorexia treatment and upon my first night of arrival I had my clothing forcibly taken off twice, once so they could check all over my body for self-harm marks and the next by a female doctor to examine me. She pulled off my bra and panties against my will while I cried and tried to push her hands away. When she was done with the forced, rough examination she just said "Why does that make you sad?" like nothing had happened. 
I quickly redressed and curled into a tight ball and wrapped the blanket as tight around me as I could and I just cried and screamed for at least an hour. the nurse whom was assigned to watch me was not at all sympathetic, and when they decided I had been crying for too long, they just picked up a pillow and held it over my face until I couldn't breathe enough to keep sobbing and stopped for a moment. They just said "I don't know if this is just you having a fit or what, but you need to stop. there are people in rooms on both sides of you and they're trying to sleep and your disturbing them."
I was being berated for being traumatized. 
After that I just started rocking myself and saying "It didn't happen, it didn't happen, it didn't happen" over and over again until I felt numb. 
I can't stop remembering it and having that happen has made recovering even harder, beens I feel like I was violated again. Being raped is the main cause for my eating disorder, because I was so disgusted by my body for what happened, and I'm afraid of looking sexual so I didn't want to look womanly and mature, which starvation prevented. Rememebring being seen and touched makes me want to starve as much of myself away as possible. I feel like my body doesn't even belong to me because of how many people have violated it. 
Im frustrated because I know it shouldn't have upset me that much to be examined, as it was all medically required. But it did, and it has made me even worse than ever. It was so triggering for the memories of what happened to me. I have flashbacks everyday now and I have nightmares from it more often than I used to. Is there anything I can do? I can't receive proper therapy because I'm under 18 so if I mention being raped to my therapist it will be reported, and I *do not* want it to become an investigation or for anyone to really know. and I'm too embarrassed to mention the things that happened in hospital because I feel I'm being stupid for being so upset and it wouldn't make any sense without knowing I was raped. 
Can I do anything to forget? to feel less disgusted and ashamed and humiliated and worthless and helpless? I always feel like I deserved it and like it was my fault for not being able I stop it even though I was just a little kid and shouldn't have had to defend myself from a caretaker...I also currently live with her so I'm reminded of it everyday.

	<TEXT> And I'm still afraid of the therapist. Being alone with another woman terrifies me, as I've mentioned before. The fear I felt when she was taking me back to her office and when the door clicked shut behind us was unbearable. I know it's irrational but I felt like she was going to harm me, which is how I feel with most women. It upsets me that I'm so frightened by them, because I know that alot of women are really great, kind people. I just can't get over the fear. 
I wish I could talk about the things that have happened to me. I want to talk about how I've been abused and raped and how things that happened to me in the hospital (2 week hospitalization or anorexia) made me remember being raped and how it's caused me so much pain. The times I was made to remove my clothing so I could be looked over for self harm marks, when I was fully examined the first night I arrived and my clothing was forcably pulled away by a doctor to look at me, I had to shower and change my clothes while being watched, and it was all done by women, which reminded me ever *more* of the abuse. It was so horrible to me. I cried for hours, I hated myself more, I remembered all the bad things that happened to me in the past, I felt violated and humiliated again. I feel traumatized after those things even though I know it was just normal, medically required things.  It's frustrating because I don't think it would have disturbed me so much if I didn't have these emotional scars from what's happened before. 
I would love to talk about how I feel disgusted by my body and I just want to starve as much of myself away as possible.
I want to talk about all of the other abuse my parents have done to me. 
But I can't because I'm afraid of women, because of what a woman did I me. 
And I'm too shy to speak to people in person. 
And I can't change therapists.
So instead I said it all here, where I can't be harmed like that and all I have to do is type my thoughts...I feel ashamed of what happened even as I'm writing this but I can't keep it to myself... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (Deleted an reposted because of a typo in the title)
Again, posting about abusive Nmother, and also about abusive father. I want to get help, tell someone I'm being abused and that I'm not safe and that I cant continue to live this way. I want to tell someone that I've been emotionally abused and beaten and sexually abused. I want to but I'm too ashamed and humiliated to even speak it and I have no idea who to tell and I don't want to have to deal with all of the trouble it would cause and all of the things that would happen, and worst of all, Im afraid no one would believe me. If I did speak out, I know my parents would just contradict everything I said. They would, like always, deny having ever harmed me. They always deny the emotional and physical abuse, to my face whenever I mention it (usually during arguments), and I just can't even bring up the other abuse. They always say I'm making it up or remembering things wrong. If I did tell someone, and I wasn't believed, or there wasn't enough proof, or if my parents seemed more truthful than me it would be so much worse than it is now. I don't even want to think about all the pain they would cause me if I tried to expose this. I'm also afraid of how much more humiliated and disgusting and unworthy I will feel. I hate myself for being abused. I just don't want anyone to know. I don't want to admit that I've been hurt so much. Im a very quite, shy, reserved person, and I can rarely speak, let alone to speak about things so personal and secret. Remembering being raped makes me feel so so so filthy and impure and just absolutely repulsive. I hate feeling so violated. I feel truly ashamed because of what happened to me. Telling someone would be impossible. And what would happen if I was believed? Would I be placed in a new home? That would be terrifying because of my trust issues. And I don't even know what to expect. It seems like it would be better to just wait it out for the next 3 and a half years, but I'm not sure if I can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ive posted here before about how my mother seems to think that me having anorexia is just so hard on *her* and is ruining *her* life because of what a "bad choice" I made and what a selfish daughter I am for "letting it get this bad". Well, now she has started another fight about how I'm just *so* stubborn because I wouldn't talk to my therapist. But the only reasons I wouldn't talk to her is because I'm terrified of most women so being alone with her made me panic so I just ended up sitting with my knees pulled up to my chest trying to remember how to breathe, and because she wouldn't say anything to me at all. Just silence. I also have social anxiety, so I *can't* start a conversation. I needed the therapist to initiate, but she wouldn't. I don't know what that's as about. 
So my mother screamed a me for half an hour about how stupid it is for me to be scared of women because "You **are** a woman, Angel! you can't be scared of them! Your just refusing to get better!!" The worst part is, my mother is the very reason why most women make me so nervous.
Well somehow this fight turned into us arguing over whether or not she abused me. I mentioned how she constantly degraded me verbally and beat me phyically, and told her she was the reason I had such low self esteem, as she has been tearing me down my whole life. And basically told her that you can only call a child a worthless bitch so many times before they end up believing it forever. 
She then starts screaming at me about how "I have done nothing but love you and take care of you your whole life!! I have done EVERYTHING for you!!"
I said that you don't treat somebody you love the way she treats me.
She says that I need to stop refusing that anybody loves me. which is strange considering that just minutes before this, she said I didn't deserve to be loved by anyone. 
I said that I do have people who love me, but that I **know** she isn't one of them. 
And then she takes it too far. "Like who, that guy in Europe you've mever even met!? Because I'm sorry but talking to someone on the other side of the world who you've never even met is NOT a relationship!"  She then tells me that my relationship is not even real, that it's just in my head, and that "Someone you've never been in the same room with *can't* love you!" 
I've been in a long distance relationship for more than a year, with someone who basically saved my life, and she said it was all in my head. 
No bitch, no. She has said horrible things to me all of my life but telling me that my relationship wasnt real, simply because it is long distance, was too fucking much. 
Then, she calls her mother to come and "Help me, my daughter won't stop being evil! She's saying such horrible things to me!!" She even brought out the fake tears. And eventually she arrives and starts berating *me* for "mistreating" my mother. "You mother is in there crying, don't you hear her? You hurt her!"
Thing is, I had been crying the whole damn time she was screaming at me and had only just stopped a few minutes before, but clearly beens my psychopathic narcissist mother was crying, I'm a horrible person.  
 I didn't do anything but defend myself and state the facts that she has abused me. And *I* end up looking like the crazy, cruel one **again** and end up feeling so horrible that I binge and purge and fucking relapse.
 Now I have to try to get my eating disorder (anorexia binge-purge subtype) back under control before I end up back in the hospital. I keep messing up because she keeps pushing me and I'm never going to be able to get better until I can legally get away from her in a few years.
Then the next day she acts like nothing even happened. Like she *didn't* scream cruelties at me, deny abusing me, and invalidate my fears because she doesn't understand them, and push me to relapse. 

Thanks, Nmother, love you too /s </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so recently one of my friends realized I have an eating disorder.
Thing is, she only found out because she kept on asking me and asking me and asking me about food. "What's your favorite flavor of pie?", "What's your favorite kind of milkshake?", "What's your favorite ice cream", and a whole bunch of other foods. 
My answer to all of them was something like "I don't like (insert food here)" 
Then, after doing that a ton of times she's just like "Oh, you're one of those eating disorder people, aren't you?" Exactly like that! She wasn't even concerned at all! It was so unemotional and uncaring. She just seemed like she totally didn't even give a fuck.
So I told her that I'm anorexic but I'm working on recovering, but still really uncomfortable about food. 
And the most upsetting part about her finding out is that, literally ten minutes later, she asks me what my favorite type of cake is!! My favorite type of CAKE!! Only moments after my confessing my anorexia! And then when I said I don't eat cake, she said I was weird! She insulted my eating habits right after I told her! It made me feel so unloved...

And then today, my other friend, who ALWAYS tells me how little I eat and tries to fucking force-fee me every day at lunch period at school, just looks at me, rolls her eyes, and says "Are you bulimic?" 
I said no.
Then she says "Ok, I was just asking because you never eat much."
That's not even what bulimia is! Bulimia is binging then purging, not starving! and I mean, before I was recovering I did purge as well but I didn't binge. I have anorexia with purging tendencies. 
And when she said it it was so...like...she just seemed bored when she said it. Like an eating disorder is some humdrum thing of no concern at all. I could barley keep from crying. 
It just hurts no know that they don't even care about it. My friends don't even care about me at all. They do a lot of other stuff (trivializing all of my problems, saying rude things about me, a lot more) that also shows they don't really care. I wish they could at least pretend to be concerned for me...It makes me feel so worthless and unimportant and just...like a shadow, noticed but not payed any mind to. I just wish someone would listen and care. I don't want be alone with this...

Sorry... I just really needed to vent. Thanks for reading it3 </TEXT>
