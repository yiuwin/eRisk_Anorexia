	<TEXT> I've recently started playing Pokemon again and decided to try finishing the national dex for the first time (in Omega Ruby). Can't get the Legendary Dogs, Kyogre, or Legendary Birds (and missed Mew events ;_;)--but what I CAN get are the Black and White "new" and legendary pokemon. Didn't play anything between HGSS and XY; which of the B/W and B2/W2 would you recommend? 

Any help would be appreciated~ </TEXT>

First time posting here (and on Reddit in general) so I'm not entirely sure how things work but I'll try! 

Got both the Xerneas   Yveltal from a good friend who got them through codes when they were being distributed in Japan (last year, I believe?). Both are untouched. 

 * OT: XY Z (both) 
 * ID No.: 11055 (Yveltal) 
 *             10295 (Xerneas)
 * LVL: 100 (both)


Your pick which of the two you'd like for a Mew. And if somebody has a Lugia   Kyogre (gotta try pushing my luck) they're willing to trade for either, that would be fantastic. No issues providing proof if asked; I don't know what to show as evidence of legitimacy on this post. 

Thanks! </TEXT>
