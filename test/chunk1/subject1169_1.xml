	<TEXT> Hey. Start with the recommended routine first. A full-body strength training will help you to lose weight. You will build muscle, and your body will release hormones that help you with burning fat. It has been shown in studies that doing a full-body strength workout is better than doing, say, one hour of steady -state cardio per week. If you could do the recommended routine along with 1 to 3 HIIT sessions per week, it will give really good results. But it could be too much to do 3 strength training sessions AND 2 HIIT sessions per week. You can do HIIT workouts a home (search for fitnessblenders.com, they have short   but intense workouts for every level), but you can also go outside and switch between jogging and sprinting for 10 to 15 minutes. But it should be sustainable for you, you know. You wanna build a new healthy lifestyle, so it should be something you actually like. So doing a sport like parkour, soccer, football, track and field or anything you like that gets you going would be fine too. 

Hey man, I am a teenager too. I healthy 99% of the time (whole grains, nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits, legumes). Just ask you parent to make some more vegetables, cook more vegetarian meals etc. Also look for a healthy lunch and some healthy snacks that are easy to prepare so you can always take it with you to school.

	<TEXT> If you want more definition, you've got to lose weight. If you want to start losing weight, you should consult a doctor first, since you're a teen. Seriously, it could wreck your health. Lose weight in a healthy way, eat healthy and lose weight gradually. Special diets are unhealthy, don't work in the long run and you will also lose muscle with crash diets which is obviously not your goal. Don't expect to lose 10 pounds in 1 month. That's way too much. 
The recommended routine will certainly build some muscle, provided you train hard, your recovery is good (sleep around 9 hours, which is the recommendation for teenagers and you eat plenty of healthy foods) and you apply the progressive overload principle (increase intensity or volume, so you get better each workout). However, you should know that if you are trying to lose weight and eat less than you expend, it's going to be harder to gain muscle. Usually you can only gain either muscle OR lose fat. But since you are new to resistance training it's possible. 
 
If it's safe for you to lose some weight and do workouts you should also do some cardio. I recommend either walking or high-intensity-interval training (HIIT). But the latter is not a good idea if you have any medical issues. And HIIT is also very, very intense, so you can't do it too often without impeding your recovery (1 to 3 times a week is probably a good range, but don't start of doing 3 HIIT sessions AND 3 rr workouts). 

Train hard, train safe. And train for health. Much luck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks man! I'm gonna buy Ultimate Athleticism then. I was going to go to the gym anyway, to train legs with weights and some assistance lifts for gymnastic skills. Do you have experience with the program? How did it go?

	<TEXT> Hey, thanks for your answer. I know the 'best' program doesn't exist. I was just wondering if anyone had experience with the programs I mentioned or knew some other good ones. I just want to make sure that my money is spent on a good program.

	<TEXT> Hey all! I have a question. I'm looking for a good program. The BEST program. I mailed Ido Portal, and I was told that his program costs more than 1000 dollars. I'm not willing to pay that money. 
My goals are to get strong in general, be able to pull off some impressive feats of strength and body control (gymnastics), and be explosive and athletic. And of course a ripped body to fit the picture. What I have looked at previously, but not buyed: Ultimate Athleticism (by Max Shank), Body by Rings (from FitnessFAQS), online personal training (from Calisthenic Movement), online coaching from Beastskills and Gymnastic Bodies.

Body by Rings is essentially a bodybuilding program using rings. That doesn't really fit my goals, although i'd also like to build some more muscle.

Can anyone help me? It would be really appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right, the hold times in this program are way too short. I now work on the tuck variation for the front lever (legs extended to about 90 degrees), which I can hold for around 10 seconds. I don't train the back lever a lot lately because it caused a lot of strain on my elbows and biceps.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would recommend practicing getting out of the handstand. If you practice this, it should make you more confident. I am not afraid at all with handstand practice, even with HSPU practice, because I know I will be able to safely get out of the handstand.  </TEXT>

That's it for upper body days.

Two days a week is mainly strength and explosiveness, one day is more cardio (sprinting). On lower body days I also do hollow body holds and L-sits.

Height: 164 cm / 5' 5"
Weight: 56 kg / 123 lbs
Goals: back lever, front lever, freestanding HSPU, solid L-sit

	<TEXT> Yes, this is the best option. Rings are cheap and are all you need to train your upper body.
