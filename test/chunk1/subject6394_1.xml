	<TEXT> "Cryptsetup open" takes me to my partition scheme, viewable by lsblk after my passphrase is given. I still need to finish installing the bootloader, but it should be easy enough. I just needed a break away from it to realize how easy it was. 

ETA: Downvoters can kiss my ass. Leaving this up for any other newbies who might benefit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Running UEFI, simple LUKS partition. All went fine. 

Used: 

    bootcl insall

Got this famous message upon startup: 

No loader found. Configuration files in \loader\entries\*.conf are needed.

Now how do I get back in and edit that? CTRL+ALT+F2 or any variation doesn't get me to the command line from that screen. 

It's not possible to get there from the live USB, is it? Because when I run lblsk from there it doesn't even show that my disk is partitioned like it was before the installation guide in the wiki told me to reboot. Can I chroot into the system I've set up somehow?

Bit sleep deprived and been at this for hours. Just wanted to ask before I tried again tomorrow. If need be I'll keep running through this Arch install until I get it right, since I feel this was a good first attempt. Minus the fact that it won't start or anything.

	<TEXT> I'm trying to upgrade with Aptitude, but it won't do it past version 1.2.3: 

    Unpacking python-oauth2client (1.2-3) ...
    Setting up python-oauth2client (1.2-3) ...

The following: 

    pip install --upgrade oauth2client

Gives me this: 

    OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/oauth2client-1.4.12-py2.7.egg'

I've downloaded the OAuthClient2 version I need (1.5.0), but I'm still unsure on how to use that to fix this version conflict. The ReadMe file for that directory is what gave me the last command I tried (pip install).

	<TEXT> Would I need to replace Synaptic with Aptitude as my package handler? I'm on Crunchbang Plus Plus and using Synaptic by default currently. 

EDIT: A lot of internet people are saying Aptitude is the better choice anyway. Here goes.

	<TITLE> OAuth 2.0 conflict when trying to authorize Google Calendar for Conky. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Following this guide to embed Google Calendar in Conky on my laptop running Debian: 

http://xmodulo.com/integrate-google-calendar-linux-desktop.html

I got to this: 

    sudo python setup.py install 

And got this: 

    Installed /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gcalcli-3.4.0-py2.7.egg
    Processing dependencies for gcalcli==3.4.0
    error: Installed distribution oauth2client 1.4.12 conflicts with requirement oauth2client=1.5.0,4.0.0

How can I update my OAuth 2.0 client to stop conflicting? Specifically to the version needed? 

EDIT: Tried this: 

    sudo pip install --upgrade oauth2client

Successfully installed. Still get the same error when going back to the original command I'm trying to get past.

	<TEXT> I have one I built last year for ~$750 total, and it's been difficult to sell for anything above $300. Would I make more money selling the hardware separately.
