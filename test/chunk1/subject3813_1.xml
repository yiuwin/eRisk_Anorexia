	<TEXT> I'm in close to the same situation you are, anorexic for years but after recovery my weight went out of control and now i'm trying to get back on track.This might sound counterproductive, but keeping track of what you eat is very helpful. It allows you to clearly see if you're restricting too much, and what type of things lead to a binge. Write down how hungry you were when you eating, how you felt, and how fast you ate. (You've probably done that at some point during treatment.) Remind yourself that more than 1-2 pounds a week of weight loss is probably water weight that won't help anyway. Pick a healthy mantra to replaced the eating disordered ones you're used to. Concentrate on eating slowly until you are satisfied. Learn to listen to your body, not ignore it. If you're truly hungry, and not just emotional or thirsty, eat. If your body is full, don't eat. (Sounds alot easier than it is) Don't skip meals! That leads to a binge. Most importantly, find the negative self hating thoughts that so rudely intrude and replace them with positive. When you find yourself thinking negative thoughts, picture a big red stop sign in your head and go "stop!" Have a list of positive things to tell yourself instead. 

Most of these things are easier said than done. Staying healthy is more important than being thin will ever be. Best of luck to you! Hope this helps

	<TEXT> Sophomore in college here. You have to find a reason you want to lose weight, it's hard to diet for the sake of dieting. Set goals for yourself. they have to be goals that you actually care about though, like getting into a certain pair of jeans or getting to a lower cholesterol. If you just say "I'm going on a diet" it's going to be hard to stick to it. And you have to make time to go to the gym, and find time to seek out healthy choices on campus. If you don't make the time it's going to be hard to lose the weight. My motivators tend to be things like fitting into a new dress that I couldn't fit into previously, or being able to run further than I could before. That's just me though. You have to find what works for you.

Best of luck!
