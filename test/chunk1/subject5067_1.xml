	<TEXT> Just gonna say my opinion, even tho pretty much everything worth saying has already been said.
HR are LOOKING strong, but in reality the wins they've gotten aren't that impressive(since f3 got smashed against nEophyte and nV r slumping hard atm) but tie with LGB is definetly worth mentioning.
Na'Vi has been looking regularly strong, which makes me think that big on Na'Vi would be the right choice here.. if odds wouldn't be looking like that. currently they are 82-18 in favour of Na'Vi, and im not yet quite sure if im willing to take the risk, i don't think HR can take 2 maps from NV, but crazy stuff has happened before.
TL;DR Na'Vi looking stronger but odds make betting on Na'Vi kinda risky, small on HR or big/med on Na'Vi coz YOLO

	<TEXT> Yea i was in similiar situation by myself, just buy 5 2$ skins/keys and gather up alot information before betting, also you could get into some good player's betting group but it would cost around 1/2k. Just make smart bets and listen to every 'prediction/analysis' as a source of information and try to gather up enough info so you can bet, there's no easy way but getting bunch of .50 skins and betting on underdogs could work aswell :P GL bro, and remember to HF =) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have very little information about these two. 
Pretty much everything i know is that they won ex Fenix and played 1-1 against Clown9 LG had different lineup in those so doesn't make me any more confident..
Paradox hasn't done anything that would make me place lot of skins on them either.. they lost 0-1 to CLG and fnatic which are pretty good teams, but still. They only took 8 rounds from CLG and 7 from Fnatic aswell. 
TL;DR ICB/low on Paradox. IF you're rich and can bet on game that's pretty risky go med on LG, its 60-40 for them IMO

	<TEXT> My small analysis (kinda new here)

Both have been performing.. krhm.. ''poorly'' shall we say, but i think fnatic has been playing just a tiny bit better. Therefore if i'd have to max bet i would bet on fnatic, but if the odds stay like this (they're unreal atm, probably ppl ragebetting coz of lgb game) only option is icb/low/med (if you're rich enough to) for NV. We all know their recent performances have been pretty sh*t, but their slumping has to end someday (right?..) and it could definitely be today

	<TEXT> What im thinking is going med on HR, not saying you have to (inb4 downvote 4 sway) This is kinda 50/50, if f3 is playing as they usually are they should take this (like 60-40 for them then) however they just played incredibly bad and if they continue i don't see HR losing 2 maps for them. 
TL;DR my advice is play the odds (bet on the one that has less % for bigger value) OR bet on your favourite team and enjoy this, if f3 playes well will be good game, if not.. ezzkinzezlyf GL! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My analysis =)

Fnatic is known to be one of the best, if not best team in csgo, they have had bad times but overall they have been able to beat everyone, and never slumped as badly as others (IMO.) Also their performance in this Lan has been very nice, they've had alot of confidence and they have played well.
TSM in the other hand seemed extremely shaky while playing against some teams that aren't that far away from their skill level, and after seeing what vp did to them, i feel pretty confident going med on fnatic (maybe like 5$ out of my 30$ in so HUGE. ) This match could basicly be close one or go really poorly for TSM, but i dont see fnatic getting crushed, which is the reason i'd suggest betting on them

	<TEXT> okay, so im just gonna say what i feel like will happen and leave my spreadsheet there, really new to this stuff so things might be incorrect.. Any comments appreciated


TSM  vs  Na'Vi

Tsm just lost to a vp after a long game and i feel like they're feeling tired and frustrated and that their team chemistry isn't going to work as well as it did in the match against na'vi yesterday(?), Na'Vi in the other hand haven't had anything that would make them feel unconfident or frustrated, so i think Na'Vi is favoured in this one.
After saying that i still feel like this is a skip(and im personally going to skip this)
Na'Vi may be the favoured one here, but the real-life odds aren't more than 55-45 IMO. If you still feel like betting tho, go small on Na'Vi and watch guardian destroy TSM :) GL for everyone!
