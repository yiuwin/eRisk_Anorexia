	<TEXT> To everybody that has played the beta, please help me choose which one of these two toons to prep for my main as Legion:

* Human Retribution Paladin.
* Orc Fury Warrior.

Seeing that the AP grind for the weapons kind of limits one to choose one main initially, based on your experience which is the most fun?

I looked at some of the gameplay vids and really like the new melee animations, especially the Fury warrior's ones. So that is a big reason for me leaning towards the Orc fury warrior. But the Ashbringer...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi All


I love the warrior class from WoW, and really like it in HS as well.


But it is so frustrating to build these expensive decks and have to rely on just the right cards at the start to win even against a zero cost hunter deck at ranks 20-15.


I have a a control warrior, grim patron warrior and aggro warrior deck. Some do better against some classes, but the bane of my existence are the damn face roll hunter aggro decks or the priest entomb decks.


I currently sit at 101 wins in ranked mode, started a month ago with the game.


How can I improve my odds against these face roll aggro and priest decks?


I love playing the control warrior as a win with it feels like I actually worked for the win.


When I jump over to my face hunter deck I can go from level 20 to 15 in two hours, winning without thinking; this however is no fun at all.


Please help.

	<TEXT> Hi all


Out of the following characters, taking into consideration that I would like to RP (EU-Argent Dawn) as well as PVE (not heroic or mythic raid though) what would you recommend.
Each one has a bit of a back story and various achievements. I would like to complete as much achievements on the character I decide to take into Legion.


So, here they are:

1. Male Worgen Beast Master - This guy is all wild and one with the pack. He uses mostly wolfs like Gara, Skoll and the green fell wolf. He rides on a wolf when not running wild. Professions are LW and Skinning. - Here is the Wowhead planner for him: http://www.wowhead.com/planner#eu-argent-dawn-adoff


2. Male Dwarf Marksman Hunter - This dwarf uses engineering to create all sorts of devices to assist him in his marksmanship skill. He will not use any pets (apart perhaps from the techno pets one can get via engineering in Legion). His professions are Mining and Engineering. - Here is his Wowhead planner: http://www.wowhead.com/planner#eu-argent-dawn-dwargoth


3. Male Human Paladin - Protection paladin and retribution paladin. Purely lawful good. His quest is among other things to get the Ashbringer and bring justice to all demons and evilness. His professions are Mining and Blacksmithing. - Here is his Wowhead planner: http://www.wowhead.com/planner#eu-argent-dawn-linheart


Now keeping in mind that I want to complete as much achievements on the character before Legion hits as well as have the most RP fun, which of these three should I develop and prep?


Thanks for any advice in advance ;) </TEXT>

The confusion as far as I am concerned comes in with the following.

If you ran (past tense) the instance 458 times and did not get the mount (yes you are extremely unlucky) your odds of getting the mount on your current run is only 1%.

Your odds on getting the mount in at least one of your next 458 runs (future events that did not happen yet) is 99%.

	<TEXT> Yes, the more you roll a dice or run the instance the better your odds will become of getting it.

The odds will never become 100% (can't have a 100% probability) but it will approach 100% the more rolls you do.

BUT the chance of the current roll is still for a die only 1/2 or for the mount 0.07%

To put it another way, if some AI ran the instance 1000 times for you while you were asleep and the mount did not drop and you ran the instance the 1001 time, the odds of the mount dropping for you  is still only 0.07%. But it is unlikely that the mount would not have dropped for the AI in 1000 runs. To be exact the AI have a probability of 0.00088971004 to run the instance 1000 times in a row without success. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everything you said until the last paragraph makes sense and is exactly the same as what I am saying.

In your last paragraph you are are multiplying with 0.007 for your 100'dred run in your pre-event calculation. Why?

The odds of NOT GETTING the mount at all after 100 runs are

0.993 to the power of 100 = 0.49536446535 or 50% 

Note that these odds of not getting approaches zero, but never becomes zero and the odds of getting the mount if you ran the instance 10000000 times without success is still 0.07% for the current run. It is however very unlikely that you would not have received the mount in 10000000 runs (3 to the power of -30508 http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.993+to+the+power+of+10000000 )

	<TEXT> Every roll will have exactly a 1/100 (1%) chance of being a 52 irrespective of all previous rolls.

Your cumulative chance of not rolling a 52 on every single roll in a row (all subsequent rolls) until you eventually roll a 52 is the initial chance of not rolling a 52: (1 - (1/100)) = 0.99 to the power of the amount of unsuccessful rolls.

Thus your chance of not rolling a 52 three times in row with a 100 sided die is:

0.99 * 0.99 * 0.99 =  0.97 or 97%

And your chance for not rolling a 52 on a 100 sided die after you rolled 999 other numbers will be  (thus on your 1000'nd roll):

0.99 to the power of 999 = 0.00004360732 http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.99+to+the+power+of+999

Because we are multiplying by a value less than one our cumulative chance of not rolling a 52 approaches 0, however the odds for each roll is still only 1/100

	<TEXT> Each roll of the die is a completely separate unique event. For example to illustrate this, lets assume we use a die with only two sides (basically a coin). Also the coin needs to fair, thus there is a one out of two (1/2) chance for the coin to land on a one and a one out of two (1/2) chance for the coin to land on a two.

Now if you rolled the coin 50 times and by some fluke you got 50 ones in a row, the chance of getting a one on the next roll is still (1/2).

Given the above, the chance to roll 1 - 7 on a 1000 sided die is 7/1000 FOR EACH ROLL, irrespective of all the previous rolls. Each new roll has the exact same chance of being 1 - 7 and that chance is and stays only 7/1000. 

Where you are getting confused is that you believe that somehow the previous rolls or the up coming rolls have an influence on your immediate next roll. They don't.

However, let's say that x = your_accumulated_chance_of_not_getting_1_to_7_in_a_row thus, x starts out on your first ever roll as x = (1 - 0.07). Hence on your first ever roll your chance of not getting a 1 - 7  on a 1000 sided die is 0.93. Each time you roll again, x is multiplied by it's previous value to calculate the chance of not getting a 1 - 7 on the current roll. This stays 0.93 for each roll.

Thus your chance of not getting a 1 - 7 on your second roll (provided you did not get it on your first) is 0.93 * 0.93 = 0.86. If your second roll was also not a 1 - 7, your chance of not getting a 1   - 7 for your third roll is 0.93 * 0.93 * 0.93 = 0.804.

So, because we are multiplying the chance NOT TO GET a 1 - 7 IN A ROW by a value which is less than 1 (0.93) eventually our chance NOT TO GET a 1 - 7 IN A ROW will approach 0 (limit theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics) )

As soon as we do roll a 1 - 7, the chance not to get a 1 - 7 in a row resets.

But most importantly, each roll still only have a 7/1000 chance of being 1 - 7 on a 1000 sided die. </TEXT>

I started just after new years day and only play a few hours now and then. My Jedi Knight is already level 55 and I only just arrived on Tatooine - still chapter 1.

I do only the purple quests and one or two heroics on each planet (to at least get a little bit of a challenge as I don't one shot aoe mobs in the heriocs).

I am currently playing for the story and hope that I will get some challenge when I hit level 65 and can do group content. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, each run stays completely independent of all your previous runs (be that 10 or 10 000) and each new run only have a 7 out of 1000 chance (probability) for the mount to drop.

However the chance (probability) of you not getting the mount for each new run is (1 - 0.07) * your_current_prob_of_not_getting_it 

Thus seeing that you are for each new run multiplying with a factor less then 1 the chance of not getting it in a row approaches zero but never becomes zero. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not exactly, irrespective of the amount of runs already done, you only ever know that if you were to run the instance 1000 times you *should* get the drop about 7 times or put another way, after every 142 runs the mount should have dropped once.

However there is no guarantee that it will do so and it will never amount to a 50% probability ever, no matter how many runs you do. In fact the more runs you do (think millions of runs) the closer you will get to the exact probability of getting the mount for each new run.

	<TEXT> It is all just made up. Gravity and the speed one travels at changes time drastically.

If the game (or the SW universe) were even semi close to reality travelling from one star system to another at light speed (or very very close to it) would cause the persons left behind at the point of departure to age by millions of years compared to the time we take to travel.

	<TEXT> No, these are statically independent events (each run). The only thing one can say with certainty is that you only have a 0.7% chance of getting the mount every single run.

Your odds don't get better the more you run the dungeon. You have exactly the same odds of getting the mount on your first run compared to your 1000'nd run.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi All

First the game seems enjoyable. Not sure why all the negativity over here and on the official forums (anyway that is a topic for another day).

I starting playing on and off since about a week ago. I am still only in chapter 1 and I am already level 54. Just started on Tatooine now.

I have some questions now that I understand the game a bit better.

1. If it says for instance "Tatooine: 52" at the top left of the screen, does that imply that on my server there currently are 52 players on Tatooine? Thus there is no cross realm function in SWTOR? 
2. Given the above, should I re roll on a more populous server if I plan to stay in the game for a couple of months (maybe even years). 
3. I rolled on a RP server as in other MMOs the RP servers tend to stay more active after the hype of a new xpack (or the new SW movie) waned due to the server population not just playing the game for PVE and PVP. Is this the case here as well.
4. Will I out level myself from content and block myself from completing the class quest line if I continue leveling at the current pace. Seems I could hit max level before even starting the first xpac...
5. Should I leave professions until after I completed the story in the game as they can be grindy.

Also I am playing a JK and like to play the "Paladin" type archetypes in games. However my companion Kira seems to lure me in to a romance situation. This forces me to choose options I feel are IC against the Jedi code (understandably so as attachments can cause a lot of problems :)) Quite eager to see where this will lead to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all

I am busy leveling my JK and I am level 42 at this point in time. Although still only very early in the story (levels came to quick :) )

Coming from another MMO, where are all the people hanging out though? Is there a capital city or town where one can just go and RP a bit?

I am on the the EU RP server 'The Progenitor', but it feels empty. Not sure who here have played for instance on WoW - EU Argent Dawn, but there was (and still is) always RP to be found.

Major reason for me to play MMO's is the RP scene, and given the immense possibilities for RP in the Star Wars universe I have to believe that I am just not looking in the right place yet.

Please give me some advice on where to hookup with other players.

P.S. pardon spelling and grammar, English is not my first language. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-12-24 08:00:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started the install two nights ago.

It seems that enough has been downloaded to allow me to play on the starter worlds. The game allows me to launch and create a new character and I can play the start of the game.

The problem I have is that I need to update / download the game at my parents place on my laptop due to them having uncapped DSL. I left my laptop there now for two nights and it is still installing. It is seems to trickle through at 512kb/s although looking at windows resource manager it is closer to 120kb/s. They have a 2mb/s line.

It is now only at 38.47%

I only have a 5Gb cap of mobile LTE data at my place and thus cannot download and or complete the install on my desktop.

I was planning on copying the final directory once it is completely installed (at this rate in a few weeks it seems) over to my desktop  gaming machine and just run a repair and play the game.

Now for may questions:

1. Once I finally reach the stage of completely installed on my laptop which has been doing this for 48+ hours will the game really be fully installed? i.e. it won't start to download some more gigs of data without letting me know?

2. It is possible to copy this completely downloaded and finalized install directory over to my desktop and just run a repair. I asked this previously and it seems that it is possible.

3. Once the game is completely installed and all downloaded, what is the typical bandwidth usage by the game. For instance how much data will be used up by an hour of play time? 

I must say I am really looking forward to playing this game, but so far it has been a real struggle. I bought the Origin deluxe pack yesterday and apart from the email stating that I purchased it, I have not heard anything from them again and my account also does not show that I am subbed.

People can say what they want about Blizzard, but damn their tech and tech support really works very, very well.

P.S. Unfortunately I cannot post this to the official forums as a sub is needed for that. Seeing that Origin has not sent me anything yet I am still seen as unsubbed. However this actually makes me wonder how the forums would really look if unsubbed people could post...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all

Due to my geographical location I have a ping of about 200-300 MS to Europe.

Is there a SWTOR server in Europe?

This latency is not a problem in WoW (at least not for PVE) as all abilities have cool downs and spells have it so that the last 1/3 of the casting time allows you to press the spell button again to recast it.

Is SWTOR also lag friendly or does it require instant reflexes and low latency during raids? </TEXT>

I have limited time and always seem to only be able to get my toon to be able to do about Torment 3 before a season ends.

So I was thinking of instead just leveling my non seasonal characters, but what would I really miss out on?

Is everybody playing seasons only? Also will I not be able to get full end game sets and such that are seasonal only?

Takes a lot of time to level and regear everytime... </TEXT>
