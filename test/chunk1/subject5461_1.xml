	<TEXT> Check out Looper. Bruce Willis plays the older version of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character sent back in time, and there's a scene where his life plays out in fast forward so you can see the transition of one into the other. Of note, at one point you can see Bruce right before the last bits of his hair came out, which I thought was hilarious because it looks like Gary Oldman let him borrow his Fifth Element wig. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got the Wings of Mastery last season. UE is definitely the hardest of the DH dungeons. If that's the one you're set on, I highly recommend cubing the Illusory Boots and spending a few seconds rounding up two large-looking spider packs before firing. One pack is usually close but no cigar, 15-17 mobs per shot. Be sure you have plenty of movement speed; it's hard to get around without spamming Vault. The hardest set dungeons are all about finding the strat and getting into a rhythm. Once you get into the groove, it's only a matter of getting the right spawn and you'll get there :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like it's cheating to say Guitar Hero, Rock Band, et al. :P

Among original scores, to me a memorable melody is what makes for timeless music (John Williams is a master of this), which happens to be what most 8-bit games had to rely on simply because music processors couldn't produce more than a couple of tones simultaneously. Most of the original Megaman games were great to me simply because they've been stuck in my head for about 20 years now. That's not to say old chiptunes beat modern soundtracks with full orchestration and veteran composers, of course. Among newer games, to me Okami and Final Fantasy 12 reign supreme. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tarantino is the boss at making the camera itself seem like a character in its own right. I remember in Pulp Fiction, right before Jules and Vince go into the hotel room, Jules says "It ain't quite time, let's hang back." Up to this point, the camera has followed them very closely, but when they go down the hall to continue their mundane conversation, the camera hangs back by the apartment door like it's impatient to get to the next scene. I don't know, that part's always stuck with me. It did a very subtle yet effective job of building suspense with nothing more than a clever choice of positioning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I first got my set in November last year, I played it on my roommate's PS4. Then for Christmas I got my own PS4 and went to that instead. After a while I started noticing the problems you were having. Turns out it was still linking to my roomie's system as well as my own, so it was confused I guess. I learned how to completely wipe the drum's Bluetooth cache (holding down a certain combo of buttons for about five seconds; you know it worked if the controller's LED turns purple) then re-establishing the one connection to my own PS4, and it's been smooth sailing since.

Off the top of my head, I believe the buttons you hold down are Options, Share, Square, X, and Circle </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the very early game (before level 70), the blacksmith is definitely worth upgrading gradually. All you need is access to the highest-damage weapon you can equip (usually either a 2h mace or a crossbow). Slow, hard-hitting weapons are the most efficient use of your resource early on. It can also be worth upgrading to get the highest level rubies you can and jam them into your weapon whenever possible. Damage uber alles; on lower difficulties there's little reason not to go full glass-cannon :) </TEXT>

A while back I went to a Soundgarden reunion show, and a lot of people there were dressed like it was grunge cosplay night. This one chick had on a tube top, mini skirt, fishnet stockings, and a flannel draped over all of it. She was idly trading barbs with her boyfriend a few places ahead of me in the beer line, and he good-naturedly said she looked like a "grunge prostitute". Without missing a beat, she replied "Yeah, well, Black Hole Sun costs extra."

Fucking riot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And for fuck's sake don't combine it with spice. I was already known to Robotrip when I was in high school when a friend of mine introduced it to me and told me I should try both. Being the sound decision maker I was as a teenager I figured go big or go home, dropped 20 gel-caps, smoked some K2, then took another 10 gel-caps. Yeah, that in retrospect was a bit much...

For the next two hours I was in Hell. And I don't mean the figurative, end of my rope rock-bottom kind of hell. I mean my parents' basement was fire and brimstone, missing only a guy in red spandex trying to prod me with a pitchfork. What's more, I was convinced that if I could just reach the top of the steps I'd be all right, but my mom's asshole cat had deigned to perch her fat ass right in front of the door and my addled mind was convinced she was Cerberus guarding the gates of the underworld.

I can say all this and laugh now but god damn, spice was NOT made for human consumption. </TEXT>

I ended up going to static fills, where you just get a single green cymbal prompt to unleash overdrive, and after getting used to it I actually prefer them to classic, even without the latency issues.

	<TEXT> Hi /r/diablo3, just wanted to say my peace :)

So I'm two dungeons away from those sweet-ass set dungeon wings, and it's been an incredibly frustrating experience to say the least. Yet through it all I'm starting to actually really like the way these dungeons work and want to see similar puzzle challenges in future patches. For one thing, I find it cathartic that it's not enough to just take your endgame build and roflstomp your way through hoping the objective was something that died along the way. It's Blizzard's way of admitting that higher numbers aren't the only way to add difficulty. Mastering a set dungeon, to me at least, is like playing Super Meat Boy or a tricky kaizo level in Mario Maker; it's tough but fair, it's easy to reset, and it's up to you to find the strat that the designer intended to make it easier and far more consistent. Figuring out to cube the Illusory Boots or use the Gangway rune and conquering it a couple of attempts later is so satisfying to me in a way that clearing a record-high GR never will be. 

Of course I'll be going back to the endgame grind right after and it will still be as fun as ever, but the change of pace has been very refreshing and I'd love for Blizzard to give more challenging puzzles in the future.

Though for God's sake, maybe nerf Ulianna's just a bit? :) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all. I'm working my way toward those sweet-ass set dungeon wings and I only have to finish the WD to complete it. Problem is I don't have much experience with her, as I haven't played one since season 4. She has every set item in my non-season stash, but they're all a couple of seasons out of date.

My question is: can I use this character to complete the dungeons using her current S4 items, or do I have to rebirth her and start the item hunt all over again? Basically I'm asking if any significant redesigns have happened that would prevent the dungeons from working properly with old items. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So for those who may not know, Blizzard confirmed that 1 gender for each character is the official canonical version: Female Barbarian (Sonya), Female Crusader (Johanna), Male Monk (Kharazim), Female Demon Hunter (Valla), Female Wizard (Li-Ming), and Male Witch Doctor (Nazeebo)

Speaking only for myself, the only choice that stands out as particularly "wrong" is the Barbarian, because I was led to believe the male was the same one that had fought in Diablo 2, thirty years older. That would have been an interesting bit of continuity, yet here we are.

Other than that, the canonical genders are mostly interchangeable, but as a matter of opinion, if you got to choose which version of each character was "official", who would it be and why?

Edit: redundant </TEXT>

I'll say in its favor that the soundtrack is just as awesome as I remember, but other than that it's just shockingly craptastic. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Whatever else can be said about him, Michael Bay has the potential for good movies in him. At least two of his movies I've legitimately enjoyed as something other than mindless dreck, and if nothing else you certainly *know* a Michael Bay movie when you see one based solely on visual style (that's normally the kind of thing that is praised to the moon and back when applied to the likes of Stanley Kubrik or Wes Anderson).

The problem, then, is the anti-intellectual moviegoing public. Bay is under pressure from the studios to make as much money back on the ridiculous price tag of these films as possible, so he must cater to the lowest common denominator. He's just feeding slop to the hogs because the hogs love their slop. </TEXT>
