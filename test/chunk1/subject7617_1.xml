	<TEXT> I refuse to backpack it. Ive done plenty of trips with just a tiny crossbody bag (and i mean tiny, holds the essentials) and other people with same or guys just doing the dude thing and using pockets. Call me lazy i just dont want to carry a big bag around. But, on the other hand i see it working for some groups.

Everything else is on point, though i personally think 3-4 park days is too little! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use an itty bitty cross body bag, for disney and vacations in general. I like cross body because its close to me. it's big enough for my phone, camera, sunglasses, even back up battery charger. two little pockets in front for credit cards, cash, and other little things. I got it from Target. didnt cost me more than $20 and it's been going strong about 3 years now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sort of thing is whats holding me back on continuing part of White Night. Im at a part thats so...freakin...difficult. And I don't even want to record my constant deaths because it's just making me so angry. I can't even concentrate on the fact im recording when i get that angry playing, i want to just play the part without recording and start recording once i get past it. But maybe thats silly and I should just showcase the frustration (albeit in a tightly, shortly edited way). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi lovely people :) I have a youtube channel that's first and foremost a gaming channel, but being a huge disney lover, I've found a way to fit in talking about upcoming trips while playing old school disney games. I will also be vlogging both my disneyland trip in 2 weeks and disney world trip in 6 weeks, so there will def be more disney content overall. I'm certainly new at the whole youtube channel thing so im no expert but i hope you guys enjoy it! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdBVtFcCUvxHWvgoUmTLByg </TEXT>

I've gone to Disney with family and various groups of friends, so I have memories with a lot of important people in my life there and I just want to keep making them :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went a lot has a kid and im sure had that sort of perspective on "magic" but when it hit me when i was a bit older, i was 16, and had never seen illuminations. My family stepped outside of dinner, the fireworks were about to start, and my mom stopped in awe. Like, her mouth literally dropped and you could see the reflection of the fireworks in her eyes and we just stood side by side and took it in together. We both shed some tears in the end finale. That moment has stuck with me and Illuminations quickly  became a "If i dont do it on my trip, the trip is RUINED!" sort of thing. 

My mom passed away 4 years later when I was 20, and now seeing Illuminations is like having 10 minutes where I feel the most connected to her. Sounds silly, but it's true. It's become such an emotional, magical show for me. </TEXT>

I think your plans look good, but realistically i think they may change a bit with the kids moods. It's great you have breaks built in to your plans, super important! Have the kids done Mission Space or Tower of Terror? Are they thrill riders?

No, this is not me being mad that there are kids at WDW. I love kids! If i didn't I probably wouldn't go to WDW as a kidless adult! But, I've had, on more than one occasion, moms purposely use their strollers as battering rams. Like aggressively try to tap people with it, to get through. Not "oh i hit you by accident and im sorry" because hell, it's crowded, that can happen. But  i mean obviously, blatantly using it to get by. It hurts! and it frustrates me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also not a parent, but I cried almost like a baby on my trip in 2012. My parents first took me to Disney World when i was 2 (1988). I had no recollection of it, but my dad recorded the family vacation and we had it on VHS. I was obsessed with that video growing up and especially with the Main Street Electrical Parade. I used to play the whole part of us at the parade all the time, to the point my parents told me they couldn't even deal with the music anymore. But i loved it because there was a moment where Cinderella waved right at me, and my mom was so, so happy and always pointed it out. Anyway, fast forward, me thinking I'd never get to see that parade ever again. My mom passed when I was 20, and i tie a lot of my love for disney and memories of it to her, so when i got even a bit older and it was coming back i was so excited. In 2012, i finally got to see that parade again, almost 25 years later. and I cried. It was everything to me to see it again, after obsessing my entire childhood, after losing the person who introduced disney to me and made it the wonderful place it was. I cried like a baby, with the biggest smile on my face, and probably with families look at me like "who is this young woman by herself just crying?!" man. thinking about it now is tearing me up. Of 9 visits so far, it was the most magical moment I've ever had there. </TEXT>

My mom passed suddenly when I was 20 and she was pretty much the reason I got to experience Disney several times growing up. She understood the magic. And the first time I went without her I wasn't sure I could do it. And you know what? So many things made me cry that reminded me of her. And that might happen here. Emotion when you least expect it. But it's ok, embrace that and know that she'd want you to have a wonderful, magical time. It won't be a perfect trip without her but it'll be a step to healing </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's honestly a life saver for me. On OK days i can take just 1, and it slows everything down without bloat or constipation. On worse days, i start with 2 in the morning, and maybe 1 later in the day if i need to, but then i do often have that "lead belly" feeling because of it. Either way though, it does stop most issues in it's tracks, save for when i'm dealing with almost liquid. Also for me it kicks in about 20-30 minutes, which seems fast and might be a placebo effect. but it's almost consistent in that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love heels and admire them and own a few, but don't wear them nearly enough because I'm afraid of looking "too dressed up." I work at a casual office where people where whatever they want, basically. I do, from time to time, see a couple of the girls rock heels for the hell of it. But I feel always so afraid of putting them on and suddenly I look like I'm going to a fancy brunch or something. I think it's a "it's all in my head" thing, but it's also stopped me from buying any other heels. I've been eyeing [these chunky ones](http://www.clarksusa.com/us/womens/womens-medium-width/Crumble-Spice-Tan-Combi/p/26107172) for a long time and now they are on sale and i can get an additional 20% off. But then I go "well are you going to weaaar them?" and tell myself I won't have the balls to. How do I get over "I'll feel overdressed" fear? **Edit**: I bought them! Thanks for the push I needed :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always vaguely heard the name Lilly Pulitzer, but never knew what it looked like. I grew up in NYC, Queens actually. I don't think, in my 28 years of life, I have actually encountered a person here who has worn it or even had accessories. Clearly, it's not something of this area. From a class standpoint, i have no say. I didn't go to a "Greek" school and i didn't run into these sorts of people. From a purely aesthetics standpoint (and this is coming from an NYC girl who LOVES color and hates that we all get stereotyped into this neutral fashion "thing" because I certainly am not that), I think the patterns are jarring, difficult to pull off on 90% of bodies, and look like cruise wear, not something you wear day to day. I greatly dislike the look and don't understand the popularity. But again, i was never really exposed to it like many of you were, so it's all just subjective i guess. I find it ugly. That's not to say i think women who wear it are ugly or have bad taste. I just personally find it ugly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm a bit of a disney vet...maybe not to the extent of many of you, but this next trip in the fall will be my 10th (wooo!). It'll be my boyfriend's second, but the last time he went he was about 9 years old. He's a bit cynical about the disney as an adult thing, but he's coming with me (and we'll be going down with some other friends, all with overlapping days) because he knows how much I love it. He told me that's his real motivation, because he knows it means a lot to me, but at the same time he said he's admittedly not excited at all. We're going for Food   Wine (he loves his beer) and I hope that helps show him there's plenty adult to do. I also want to take him to a nice dinner (maybe Flying Fish? Have had multiple recco's on that) but I mean...what do I do to make sure he doesn't end up miserable there? Maybe there's nothing i CAN do? I'm just so worried we'll spend all this money to go and he'll hate it. </TEXT>

I was in and out of the bathroom for half an hour and I'm trying not to just cry at my desk. I know i made the dumb move of having what I had last night but I didn't expect for it to be THIS bad. I have a normal level of bad, and then once every 2 months or so, it's just liquid, i need to run to the bathroom right this second bad. And I have work to get done and meetings to go to and it's stressing me out I just want to cry :( I'm tired of this. I've had all the tests run on me, ive tried so many things to help it. Nothing.

It doesn't seem like you can save up money for souvenirs and stuff too, though you can use left over funds to purchase a Disney gift card and I guess use that. But, it does automatic payments if you want and then can be used to book hotel, tickets, dining plan and airfare on the site. It apparently has no fees and is totally free.
