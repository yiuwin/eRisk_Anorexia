	<TEXT> I don't think it's on Kawhi to bail us out in the fourth quarter by himself. Who said he was KD, Lebron, or Harden? Why should we expect him to be the kind of scorer those guys are, when he was drafted for his defense, and he's better than all those guys at that, especially Harden and KD.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's four in five days (do I need to do the math? My point remains). People complained to me about executive orders. Executive orders was the term that was used by Trump on the campaign trail. You got downvoted because you accused someone of not reading the article and then proceeded to behave like you did not read the article (3 or 4). Also, how do you define "A LOT"? We don't have a count of presidential memorandums. We don't know how many each president performed. "A LOT" is an opinion. "A LOT" seems to be one of those alternative facts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess we are squabbling over what a "prayer" means. Most people thought he was a long shot, but 30 percent, according to the poll you posted, thought he was actually going to win. Comments like this, from the thread I shared, tend to suggest something akin to a prayer: 

I feel like BJs best path to victory would be to take Yair down in a similar fashion he did with Jon Fitch in the 1st and part of the 2nd round of their fight a few years ago.
Whether he has the gas tank and durability to maintain a style like that is another question...

The idea that BJ had a path to victory, which was suggested throughout this sub, is virtually identical to the notion that he had a prayer. I personally thought he had little to no prayer, yet I watched the fight live, secretly hoping that there was a small chance; however, I saw exactly what I expected. I honestly think that prime BJ is not in the top five at LW or WW if he competed today. 

Edit: here's another - https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/5nxfas/can_bj_penn_roll_back_the_years/dcf08zm/?context=3

Hilarious seeing so many people doubt BJ. Maybe I'll look like a fool on Sunday but I have a pretty strong inkling that a lot of the "Yair is on a tear" folks are going to be surprised.

	<TEXT> Why is it hilarious? BJ is 38 years old, hasn't won in over six years, and he's fighting a guy who's won nine times over that period, five in a row in the UFC, and is only 24 years old. BJ has given people many reasons to doubt him in this fight. Now, he has to give us a reason to never doubt him again, but we still have to see that, and we haven't see it in over 6 years. BJ fought great competition over those six years, better than Yair by a big stretch, but we also saw him get absolutely smashed in most of those fights. It's been so long since we've seen BJ fight without getting smashed. We have a habit of saying what have you done for me lately in MMA but in this case I think it's warranted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got GSP at number one. He avenged all of his loses and he was a dominate champion for a long time. I got into MMA just in time to see Fedor get murked in Strikeforce. In fact, Fedor vs. Big Foot was the first MMA event I watched in it's entirety. Five years later, I've seen most of Fedor's fights at least a few times. Undoubtedly, my first impression could have created a bias in me. Still, I judge the old timers more harshly in general because I think the game has evolved way past their skill set; they were fighting in the wild west of MMA, where PED use was virtually identical to the norm, and I can't help but think some of those Pride fights, not saying Fedor's, but in general, were slightly fixed. Silva kept winning in dominate fashion after he turned 35 and did so in the UFC. It would have been a dream to see Fedor in the UFC, at LHW, where I think he belonged. Anyway, you got those three, and then everyone else. They're safe for a little while as long as Conor keeps Dee pregnant, and Jon keeps the twist on at the end of the punch and keeps driving.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding when people use the word "art" so broadly.

I like everything you said except for the first sentence. You go on to define art in various different terms, even saying that, if used as a concept, the word is subjective. If something is subjective, it's hard to say someone is interpreting it too broadly, and it's also arguing semantics to do so. I think this discussion is good to have but it's been started in a peculiar way. If I recall correctly, the sentence was akin to: "you'll be left with football and MMA, which are not **the arts**." If we are talking connotation, I believe that "the arts" narrows it down to what you said in the second paragraph. I typically hear "the arts" used in two settings, academically, and by pretentious drama nerds, Meryl Streep being the latter.  </TEXT>

Edit: This post is misleading; read the comments below for clarification. I had always been given this story piecemeal, so I seem to have unintentionally distorted the facts. Eric Clapton plays the solo on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," and I recalled reading that John Lennon had preferred Eric Clapton's guitar playing to George Harrison's;however, that, too, may be incorrect. For what it's worth, I prefer George Harrison's guitar playing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree with him defending her taking the liberty to define what art is. A truly enlightened person, I dare say an artistic person, understands that the more you understand something, the more beauty, the more artistic quality you find in that thing. How pretentious it is to think one has a monopoly on defining art. It's a failure to understand the subjective nature of art. She's a turd.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're going to a gym that is routinely exposing you to hard blows to the head, you're going to the wrong gym--especially as a beginner. You can get CTE with a single blow to the head and that can happen in a car accident. People who train MMA should not be exposed to head trauma more than in any other contact sport practice.

	<TEXT> I posted this information in response to another post, but I figured some may be interested in reading this book and wouldn't mind having access to some details before they decide to do so. I do want to attach the disclaimer that none of what I post below is indicative of my belief in Avery's guilt, or innocence. 

Here is my short review: 
https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1489933550?book_show_action=false

Here is what I posted from the book, in regards to Avery's conduct post-release: 
"Steven Avery was clearly having some issues adjusting to life on the outside. He told reporters, "I feel like it's easier in there. Some days, just put me back there, get it all over with."
His criminal conduct included minor infractions, such as speeding. He was found going seventy-nine mph in a fifty-five-mile-per-hour zone. They increasingly get more severe. I do not recall the Netflix program discussing Avery's attempt at derailing Jodi's DUI case, but it may have. Jodi was convicted of her fifth DUI offense, but according to Avery he was driving when her car went into the ditch. He told the jury at her trial that he was aimlessly driving around the county and then took Jodi to the salvage yard to show her around. A junked vehicle was blocking the entrance, so he used her car to push it out of the way, but rammed the front end too hard. He claims they left the salvage yard and he drove her car into the ditch, because of fog. Prior to that trial, Jodi called the police on Steven, on an evening where he became very violent. She came home late from the races and Steve told her to "pack her shit and move out," after saying this he pushed her, causing her to fall into a chair and hit her head. Avery got on top of her and started hitting her, telling her he should kill her. Jodi went to call 911, but before she could talk to the dispatcher, he ripped the phone out of the wall and began choking her with the cord from the phone. When she came to, he dragged her out to the car by her arms and said, "I should get the gun and kill you." Jodi and Steven eventually reconciled, she changed her story and requested to drop the charges. The police issued a disorderly conduct citation, instead of issuing criminal charges." </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The divine </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-01 08:07:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before I start, I'll briefly explain where I stand in terms of god.  I am an atheist, but I truly don't wish to challenge other people's ideas.  I enjoy discussion, but only when invited to those kind of discussions.  I don't think I have a monopoly on the truth, and I doubt the questions I pose need to result in a detour to decide whether god exists or does not.  

I am studying Hinduism in a college, and it fascinates me in a way that the Abrahamic religions do not.  There is much of value for a skeptic like me, rather then just seeing the appeal that exist people who feel the need to outlive their bodies and appeal to a higher power (and to a large extent I understand those needs).  It doesn't surprise me to hear that there are a sizable number of Atheist-Hindus, and even some sects that subscribe to a deity free "religion."  The Nasadiya Sukta stood out to me as something that was far removed from any Abrahamic school of thought.  I've only heard one person call themselves a Christian-Atheist.  I don't have the benefit of growing up in a Hindu family and culture like I do with Christianity.  How important is the divine to you?  Is the philosophy more important, and can it exist and operate without Brahman at the center?

I am writing a paper and the prompt is to write about the yoga you would be mostly likely practice if you were/are a Hindu.  The divine seems to be important to the four main yoga's.  Is it possible to properly practice one without the divine?  On the surface Jnana Yoga appeals to me, but I hardly want to write a paper that takes something that is an integral part of peoples lives and makes assumption based off surface knowledge.  Whatever insight you can offer me will be valuable and appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been unable to find particulars on a book signing I am considering going to.  I've seen that some people on here have gone to a signing in their neck of the woods, so I figured I could get some info that might help me.  The signing is about 2 hours away, but seems like a good excuse to go to Columbus and get out.  They give away 500 wristbands, that you can receive by buying the book that day.  The event is at 7p.  Have wristbands been selling out in other areas?  I'm wondering if I would have to get to Columbus really early to get one and just wait around the city all day. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Purpose based Kratom </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-07 18:06:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I only take Kratom for one reason and one time of the day (ok two if it starts fading off too quickly).  I use it at work and work alone.  I feel no desire to use it on my day off or any other time really, but for work I get cravings.  My work day goes by 20x easier.  I work a crummy minimum wage retail stock job while I go to college to get a better job.  Without Kratom the day goes by as if I had spent a literal week straight there.  I find it hard to get up for it without Kratom and frankly I feel quite miserable there without it.  Which leads me to my problem, I work 5 days a week 40 hours(usually work 5-7 days in a row).  To cover those hours in Kratom euphoria is near impossible without increasing tolerance, lowering euphoric feelings, and increasing the potential of (minor)withdrawals.  

Has anyone used Kratom for similar reasons?  How did you go about it? (I mix and shuffle strains but not with discipline)  Any advice is welcomed. I am willing to use another substance as long it is of similar safety and ability. </TEXT>
