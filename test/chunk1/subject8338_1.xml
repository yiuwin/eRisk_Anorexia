I did only tell her that I thought it wasn't working out so I could have an excuse to break up. 
I guess I'll just tell her how I really feel and see where it goes from there, I can only hope that she understands.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So Im a guitarist who has just gotten in to play bass, I play a lot of punk and alt rock, so I use a pick most of the time, but I am capable of using my fingers. Im not the richest person around so, for now, I own a Squire left handed Jazz Bass. 
Any thoughts on if Squire is actually any good, and to what kind of bass I should save up for next? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking some some new headphones. What should I get? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-01-30 00:28:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all, the headphones I currently use are the Sony MDR XD-200s. They're nice but they don't noise cancel and there's not enough bass, although I'm not sure if I should keep them, are they considered "quality" headphones?

I can't quite decide what to get, I went to my local Futureshop today and tried some Beats Pro by Dr.Dre, they had an enormous amount of bass and it was nice, but far too much trebke, the crash cymbal would crackle on higher volumes, and it was annoying. I don't quite know, should I save for some Beats? 

Anyways, I need you guys to reccommend some headphones for me, the will need to be...

Over Ear
Noise Cancelling (digital noise cancelling is okay too)
Good with bass
Moderately attractive
Within the 150$ - 200$ price range

Thanks in advance

TL;DR I need some new noise cancelling, reasonably priced headphones. I've tried Beats and they were okay, should I get them or something else? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I managed to convince a random girl in my class that she was red/green colourblind. 
 She was holding a red pencil and I asked if I could borrow her green one.
So she goes to get a green one and I give her a strange look and ask her why she's giving me a red one.
She asks me what I'm talking about, and I point to the pencil in her hand and tell her that I need that one. 
Everyone around me gets in on the joke and we referred to red as green and green as red for the rest of the day. Eventually I asked her if her eye doctor had diagnosed her as being colourblind and she started to believe that she actually was.
Many lulz were had that day. </TEXT>

I was in the hospital for two months.

I don't feel as if I've fully recovered, "junk" food still scares me, and I still try to get moderate exercise every day (walking the dog and such.)  </TEXT>
