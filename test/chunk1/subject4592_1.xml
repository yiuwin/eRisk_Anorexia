	<TEXT> So we established that Lapis's weapon is water control. So elemental control is on the table.  
We see that with the limb enhancers Peridot is cable of delivering electrical shocks.  
However in "When it rains", we see Peridot trying to fix a machine. All she does is put her hands on an internal component and it suddenly has power, even though it's been established that the original power source for the machine was destroyed.  
From this we can surmise that Peridot can supply energy, but likely needs tools to express it in a more useful manner. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-08-31 11:18:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am counting Yellow Diamond and both Rose Quartz and Steven but excluding corrupted gems,the gem shards, Lion, Connie and other humans. Meaning there are 10 Gems we have seen.  
The number of possible fusions is equal to the cardinality of the power set of gems, minus the empty set and the singleton sets. Which is 2^n - 1 - n, where n is equal to the number of gems.
For those of you not into math the power set is all the ways you can split up a set of things. Then I remove the 1 case where there are no gems, and the 10 cases where there are just one gem.
1024 - 1 - 10 = 1013.  
  
This has fulfilled your daily recommended dose of math for the day.  
Fun fact: Walter Schumann's Gemstones of the World lists only about 200 different varieties of natural gemstones.  
  
Homework: How many Gem fusions were actually possible since Rose Quartz and Steven are mutually exclusive, assuming Peridot was alive to fuse with Rose?   
My guess: 757, under the reasoning that half the sets must include Rose and Half of those must include Steven, so 768 sets remain that do not include both Steven and Rose, so minus off singletons and empty set for 757.   
Prove or disprove.

Edit: Also for the record I am discounting the possibility of more than one Pearls, if you want to do that with a potentially infinite number of pearls, replace the total number with Uncountably Infinite. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-08-30 15:59:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Really if you think about it the US siding with the Nazis makes about as much sense as the biggest capitalist country siding with the biggest communist country. Hitler could probably have waved away a lot of the racial ideology by saying that Americans were also true aryans or something like that,citing the German descent of alot of Americans. Russia and Japan were also not really hostile to each other until the very end of WW2, it's not much of a stretch to see this develop into a full alliance.  
If you ask me this is the likeliest scenario where the Nazis win, as part of an alliance with the resources and industries of the US backing it up. A German V-2 rocket with a US Nuclear warhead could have been developed and deployed, making it very likely they would win the conflict or at very least not lose it.  
Assuming a US/UK/Germany victory, it would be safe to assume that the Cold War would have started almost immediately like it did in our timeline. Except now its Nazis versus Democracy. Which begs the question of what the US Civil Rights movement would look like if the US's arch-nemesis had racism as a core tenant. Many civil rights activist had accusations of being communist. Could the opponents to civil rights be accused of being Nazi sympathizers? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In IEEE 802.11 there are 11 channels for Wi-Fi.  
Only 3 of them should be used: 1,6 and 11.  
I understand why these should be used. All other channels have overlaps. In a crowded wi-fi space it would be like trying to drive on the line during a traffic jam, at best you're waiting behind two people, at worst you're taking off someone's side mirrors.    
  
What I don't understand is why there is are channels 2-5 and 7-10. Wouldn't it be better to just say there are only 3 channels:1,2 and 3? With 1 being our channel 1, 2 being our channel 6 and 3 being our channel 11. If the other channels are so bad why was it even an option? </TEXT>

2) How do you measure the effectiveness of a character?  
3) What levels of that measure are required for participation in an Elite dungeon?  
4) What relevant information is needed for help improving those measures?  
5) Any one have any recommendations for where to get mid-level strategies? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [House Cleaning]Fridge Without Power for Unknown Number of Days </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-11 07:24:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just got back from a 2 week vacation, only to find that somehow the circuit my fridge was on had tripped. Leaving the thing without power for an unknown number of days.  
Also I live in the tropics, so it's warm all year round.  
  


Situation as I found it: 
* Extremely bad stench, that was almost stinging on the nose.  
* Maggot infestation in freezer compartment.  
* Unidentified insect eggs on freezer walls(presumed to be fly eggs)  
* Unidentified black fluid pooling at bottom of freezer.  
* Mold/fungus infestation on refrigerator compartment.  
* Unidentified spherical moldy object in refrigerator compartment.  
  
Actions Taken So Far:  
* Disposed of all contents of Freezer.  
* Disposed of everything but sealed non-perishables (EG ketchup, mustard,etc) in refrigerator compartment.  
* Removed all trays and cleaned in sink with multi-purpose surface cleaner.  
* Sprayed entire fridge interior with multi-purpose surface cleaner.  
* Unplugged fridge and open to air.  
  
Precautions taken:  
* Plastic Gloves.  
* Particulate filter mask.  
* Rigorous hand washing.  
* Shower.  
  
So any additional actions I should take? or more precautions should this ever recur?  
Should I throw out the ketchup?  
Should I declare Exterminatus on the fridge and cleanse it with fire(in an empty lot), let it cool and move it to a dump?  
Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I noticed that sometimes when there's a lightning strike, the lights go out for a second or so then go back on. In a previous house lightning cause the circuit breakers to trip.

	<TEXT> Anyone else experiencing massive graphics lag in Delta Quadrant Patrols?  
It's rendering some the episodes unplayable for me, because it's hard to control Star Trek: Online: The Slideshow.  
Weird thing is that it's only patrols in the Delta Quadrant there are problematic.  
Non-patrol Episodes are fine, patrols elsewhere are fine, just Delta.  
Anyone else having similar problems?   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Survey of Spec Point Loss </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-24 06:39:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So there are reports of Spec Point rollbacks all over the place.  
In the spirit of discovery, I would like to see if there are any patterns to this. Most people seem to think that it's related to Argala or Japori grinding, but there are simply too many counter examples of people who never grinded getting whacked.  
So post the following here.
 
How many Spec Points did you have?   
Did you lose Spec Points?  
   If so, how many out of your total?  
Did you solo Japori or Argala?  
Did you team Japori or Argala?  
Did you do anything else?  

I'll start.  
I have 23/60.   
I did not lose spec points.  
I did solo runs of Japori and Argala.  
I did team runs of Japori and Argala.   
I went a significant porition of the way into the DR storyline, also did alot of STFs. </TEXT>
