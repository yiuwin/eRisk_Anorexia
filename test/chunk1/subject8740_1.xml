	<TEXT> Having short hair. My father can't fathom the idea that I like the way it makes me look, and how easy it is to take care of, he INSISTS that I just want to be "different" and that I want to make myself look weird as some kind of defense mechanism. 

Also, my eating disorder. Honestly, if I was really only after attention I would do something that puts me in the hospital with a lot less frequency than anorexia does.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a BSN student, the direction that a lot of nursing lobbies are trying (and succeeding) to push the NP in is unsettling to me. I like the idea of being a midlevel, if somebody wants to run the show, they should be going to medical school, not trying to stretch a legitimate degree (MSN) past its limits. I am secure in my decision to pursue nursing over medicine and it concerns me that a lot of people don't seem to be, as evidenced by the DNP degree. I chose nursing because as much as I love science, I am ultimately more interested in direct patient care than designing treatments and overseeing a large patient load. I worry that all of these pushes for autonomy is making us less credible as a profession, which is a shame, because well trained NPs could be implemented in so many ways through out our healthcare system. 
I want to become an NP because I want to work in collaboration with a physician in a hospital setting, but articles like this are making me seriously reconsider my choice to pursue nursing and think about medical school again because as much as I like the field and want to be an RN, when I decide to further my education I would want a degree that I know will mean something in 20 years.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have struggled with anorexia for a long time, and I realized that this has left me with no idea of how much a normal, healthy adult woman weighs. 

I understand intellectually that being a 5'8'', 120 pound adult is on the thin side, but it wasn't until I realized none of my friends who I all see as slim and healthy weigh under 130 pounds. 

This is a hot mess of a question and honestly I want to write my whole life story here because I'm worried that people will get the wrong impression of me but my curiosity was piqued and there is no turning back. 

So how much does an adult woman weigh?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably for the same reasons that people purport to hate vegans: most of us are chill but the loud ones are super annoying, expect to be catered to and will attempt to make their diet the topic of any possible conversation. 
I have never gotten any negativity about being GF and I think it is because I don't bring it up out of context, or make it a topic of conversation; most of my friends only find out if we are in a situation that involves food. Most people have no problem going to a different restaurant because there are more options for you there, but almost nobody wants to hear about another persons diet and bowel difficulties.

	<TEXT> My mom just answered my questions as they came up, figuring if I was old enough to ask I was old enough to know the answer. We always had a super open relationship so this worked out, her answers were always age appropriate and she never gave more detail than I asked for. 

Sometimes she would bring things up but it would be more along the lines of "do you have any questions about x" and she would let me mostly steer the conversation. I think the one true "talk" we had was about birth control and how while she would prefer that I wait to have sex its my choice and she would rather I be safe and let her help me than do it in secret and take risks.

My mom very rarely made the foods that me or my sister truly hated so this really just combatted us deciding we didn't like new things because they looked funny.

	<TEXT> I think a lot of it has to do with where people are in life. Obviously there are some age gaps that are extreme (especially when there is a minor involved) but I think it is totally possible to have a healthy, normal relationship with a large age gap as long as both people are at similar stages of life.  I'm currently in college (undergrad) and to me there is a big difference between somebody who is still a student and somebody who is out on their own being a "real" grownup. I would be comfortable dating a 24 year old graduate or professional student but dating somebody that same age who is out in the real world would feel weird to me. Same thing with dating a high schooler, in terms of actual age it wouldn't be weird or legally iffy since I'm on the young side to be in college (I have a summer birthday) and there are kids in high school who may only be a year younger than me, it would still feel weird and creepy for me to be with somebody who is still living with their parents while I am living on my own and functioning as an adult.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is kind of a rant but I'm also kind of asking for advice. I thought I was doing ok, but I just got weighed when I met with my team and apparently I lost 10 pounds in the month that I was home for winter break. I expected that I'd lose some weight, because I got my wisdom teeth out, but not this much and I honestly had no idea that I had dropped so much. I know that I need to stop losing and continue weight restoring but I just straight up don't want to eat more, move less and drink multiple ensure pluses every day. I feel fine, I'm not compulsively overexercising and I'm not hungry so ugh. I was at an "acceptable" weight before (not fully restored but close enough to my ideal that my doctors weren't pushing me to gain). 

I'm just not sure what to do at this point. I understand intellectually that this is not a healthy weight for me but I feel fine and think that I look fine so I have basically zero motivation to do things (eating more and doing supplements) that are uncomfortable. 

I'm in college far away from my family and I want to stay in school, I'm the happiest I have ever been here and I finally have a good group of friends, but my doctor is already uncomfortable with me staying (she can't make me do anything because I'm an adult but if somebody with an 'MD' after their name is concerned about my health I generally believe them) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just saw it with my mom on Monday and we both loved it! I was a bit worried that the ASL would seem gimicky but they really blended everything together seamlessly and created a show that was visually and acoustically gorgeous. 

I've loved this show since I was an angsty middle schooler and seeing it with such a dedicated and talented cast was so inspiring and made me excited about theatre again! I could talk about this show for hours, there are so many little details that I loved. 

I'd also highly recommend seeing it from the mezzanine if you can. This show has so much going on visually and I think being able to be above the stage where you can really see everything gives you a better perspective than being super close up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of the admiration for nurses seems to be kind of patronizing and revolve around the ideas that they are either handholding angels (I mean some are, but its not in the job description) or that they are the underpaid, butt wiping heroes of the hospital (sure, you have to do gross stuff but a lot of that is done by techs and aids and for a job that only requires a bachelors degree, starting at 55-60 thousand a year is pretty great). I've found that people don't understand nurses and have pretty low opinions of the profession. To a lot of lay people, any person wearing scrubs who isn't a doctor is a nurse. I did super well in high school and have always enjoyed science and you wouldn't believe how many people have told me that I am "too smart to be JUST a nurse". They also aren't informed about the amount of education you need to be an RN, or how competitive it is to even get into a decent nursing program (at my large, well regarded public university they had a 28% acceptance rate). In a lot of programs you have 2 years of hard, science major science before you even really get to touch a patient.

	<TEXT> I think so. 
My dad is a very loud, dominant person. He is super charismatic, but pretty emotionally immature so he was emotionally abusive, and expressed all negative emotions as screaming rage. Though he never hit me, he is large and physically intimidating and would grab me and jerk me around or throw things. Our relationship is complicated, as much as he provided me with a good life through material things and was funny and kind a lot of the time, I can't just get past things that he said and did to me. I've accepted that he is a kind hearted, well intentioned man who wasn't equipped to parent due to his own emotional issues and narcisistic personality traits. Our relationship at this point is friendly, we speak and when he is in town we'll go out to dinner but our interactions are pretty superficial.  
I think this has led me to dating really gentle, mild mannered men nerds who allow me to be the more dominant person in the relationship. I wouldn't say that any of the men I have dated are spineless, they have opinions and don't allow people to walk all over them, are just willing to let somebody else take the lead. I am not a dominant person at all but it still makes me feel safe knowing that I can have an opinion and won't be steamrolled.  My sister says that I also aim way below my "league" when it comes to attractiveness, but I think that has to do more with low self esteem and poor self image. Plus, if a guy is kind, I don't care that he doesn't know how to dress himself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually really excited to see this response because this is the first time I have seen somebody have a home birth for a reason that makes medical sense. I can totally see how if you have a history of precipitous labor it makes more sense to be prepared to deliver at home since it probably won't end up happening in the hospital and having a planned home delivery with a professional present is better than trying to make it to the hospital and giving birth in the car or at home alone waiting for your husband/wife/domestic partner to get home from work and drive you to the hospital (that is how my moms friend ended up delivering her first kid alone in her bathroom). 
Since labors of this kind tend to get faster with each child, how did you arrange for your midwife to be able to get to you fast enough should labor start? Now that I've heard your story and see the practicality of a home delivery in your situation I'm just curious about the logistics (because I am a nerdy, nerdy nursing student).

	<TEXT> Heck, nurse midwives are equipped to handle most complications and recognize situations that are outside their scopes and contact a doctor. 
The issue is that they are not attending home births, because their graduate or doctorate level degrees and actual credentials get them jobs in hospitals and birthing centers. Home births are more likely to be attended by "professional" midwives, who only have a high school diploma and a few months of training and no affiliation with a doctor or hospital.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Girls are strongly encouraged to get into male dominated fields (which I think is great), but boys (and a lot of times girls) are discouraged from entering traditionally female dominated fields. Instead of encouraging kids to do what they love regardless of stereotypes, we are further devaluing fields that are considered "women's work" by creating this weird idea that in order to be empowered women have to get into STEM fields. Why is it not seen as an issue that most nurses and elementary school teachers are female, shouldn't boys be encouraged to branch out too? Girls who want to be 3rd grade teachers or stay at home moms should be taught that they are empowered by being able to make a choice about what they do with their life not by what it is that they decide to do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a pretty picky eater and my mom always enforced the idea of the "good manners bite", I always had to try one decent bite of something, and if I truly didn't like it then I could get myself an alternative (so I would still have to eat a vegetable/starch/protein, just not the one that I had tried and not liked). It helped to expose me to different foods and get over my weird fears of not liking things but it still allowed me to have some control over what I ate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm the same way. I always feel bad expressing it because I worry that people will think that I'm shallow, or just straight up hate fat people, which I don't. I just personally can't feel sexual attraction towards somebody who is overweight. This doesn't mean that I think they are inferior in any way or any less deserving of love, respect and human dignity. Not wanting to have sex with somebody doesn't mean that I don't respect them as a colleague or love them as a friend, it just means that I don't get excited at the prospect of seeing them naked.  
Ultimately, we all have preferences, and thats ok as long as those preferences don't come from a place of hatred or prejudice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup! I keep my hair mostly buzzed and I think it is one of the best decisions I ever made. I've had short hair for a while, and until recently I had it clipped tight on the sides with my curls grown out more on top but in September I decided to cut it all off, and I love it. I honestly feel like it makes me look more feminine, and I've never had any sort of negative reactions to it. 

Having super short hair is kind of a tricky thing, there is a fine line between looking like you make an edgy style choice and looking like you gave up and shaved your head, or like this is some kind of cry for help ala Briteny Spears.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was really deep in my eating disorder I used to hoard food. It wasn't that bad for the most part, since it was mostly granola/protein bars that my mom would send in my lunch. 

The one time it got really bad was my freshman year of high school. I didn't have a lunch period, and I was not eating the lunches my mom sent me so at the beginning of the day I would take out what I wanted from it then leave it in my locker. As you can imagine, they started to accumulate, and the prospect of cleaning out my locker became overwhelming, so I just stopped going to my locker and ignored the problem. This plan worked beautifully until one day, the school called my mother and informed her that they had gotten complaints of a foul smell in that hallway and had to decontaminate my locker like a biohazard. I have been told that there were maggots. I was humiliated by this and actually wrote thank you/apology notes to all of the janitors, who were cool about it (what is it with public school janitors being some of the most laid back, kind, funny people btw?). 

Its under control now, I still struggle with it, even if I have no intention of eating something, I'll keep it because I get really worried that I will get hungry and want it later. I only ever save packaged, nonperishable things so its not a health hazard, I just have a lot of quest bars in my purse. My mom marvels at my ability to have the same bag of m ms on my desk for weeks on end.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heck, I'm (1/2) black and I got bullied by the group of black kids at my pretty well off suburban school for acting too "white", and for being half white. The only time I've ever really been treated poorly because of my race was at the hands of other black american kids who thought I didn't act "black" enough. What made it even more ridiculous was this wasn't a class issue as these were kids whose parents were generally well educated and middle to upper middle class, like mine. I could almost understand it if I was the lone well off black kid and my having mostly white friends was seen as me thinking I was superior due to my family's higher socioeconomic status.   

I also think its stupid (and pretty racist) that this group saw my liking school, getting good grade and being quiet/nerdy as acting "white" instead of my way of being black, as if liking hip hop and basketball are the only things that define blackness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is a really good observation. I am in recovery from anorexia and much like an FA I used my normal/close to normal blood work as a reason to stay in denial that my health was in danger despite all of the other physical symptoms I was showing. I was severely underweight, had low blood pressure, a heart rate in the 40s (while taking ADHD meds, which usually raise heart rates), my extremities were blue, I was growing fur and had no energy but I still argued that I was fine because the only thing "wrong" in my blood work was my sodium (it was low). 

Like obesity, eating disorders are like ticking time bombs, you can seem mostly fine one day and the next your counts will tank or an organ will start to quit because your body is done fighting. This is why bloodwork isn't the only factor they account for in hospital admissions, and why they check it so frequently.

	<TEXT> My mom raised us in the Catholic church, even though she isn't religious she wanted my sister and I to be familiar with faith and feel comfortable in that setting if we chose to pursue it later in life. She was always very honest about her opinions and how they differed from the church but she never bashed faith or the faithful and made it clear that our religion was our own choice. 

I don't always go to church but I have a strong faith and do my best to pray and do some Bible study every night. I'm not sure about what denomination I would consider myself, I still go to Catholic mass and pray the rosary but I think a lot of my views are a bit too liberal (I identify as bisexual, take birth control and have had sex outside of marriage) I often struggle to talk about it for fear of sounding like a crazy 'born again' Christian in my liberal and generally atheist or nonreligious social circle of friends. I don't think that they would reject me as they are very accepting and easygoing but faith is just so personal. 

I don't really wear my religion on my sleeve but I feel the love of God in my life and aim to share that love with other people and demonstrate it in the way that I live.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm pretty excited! I ended up in the nursing program because I wasn't sure if I wanted to do nursing or medicine and the nursing program is a lot harder to get into than premed (mine is at a big state school in Ohio and has an acceptance rate in the 20s). I figured that if I hated nursing I could always switch to being a pre-med biology major but it would be basically impossible to go the other way. Now that I've done a semester I am pretty sure that I want to be a nurse because I am much more of a doing person and I like that modern nursing education is very science heavy and expects you to be a great scientist before you even learn procedures. 

I also chose nursing because it gives me the option to work at a good salary right after graduation (in my area, nurses start around 60,000) so if I decide to go to graduate school or med school I can have a decent amount saved to live off of, where if I graduated with a bio degree I'd really have no choice but going straight back to school and build a lot of debt.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same here. My parents were fully prepared to pay for me to get a BFA in musical theatre, and all of the coaching and travel of auditioning to even get into a program. 

They were both first generation colleges students who felt a lot of pressure to study things that were practical and would lead to good jobs, so they wanted to give my sister and I the chance to follow our dreams. 

Ultimately, I decided against the BFA because I can get good training for a lot less money elsewhere and I'm not sure that I'm outgoing enough to make a career as an actor. I also love learning and school and realized that college is the only place that I can study science and learn new academic things, I'd probably be bored out of my skull in a completely performance based program. I can always take a year off and try to be an actor with my nursing degree since they don't worry about credentials if you audition well but with a BFA you're kind of stuck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its really great that you are so aware and want to help your girlfriend! I'm not sure of your exact situation, but I would caution you against getting too involved, eating disorders take over every aspect of your life and it is nice to have people in your life that you can just talk about normal things with. Since she is in therapy 3 days a week, I'm sure she spends more than enough time talking about her ED and I think it would be best for you to support her by being there to remind her that there is a world outside of anorexia. 

Another thing that I would caution you against is becoming too much of a caregiver or the "food police". As much as you want to help the person you love, it is also really important to remember what your relationship is and not let the eating disorder change that. Trying to be to be the caregiver is a recipe for resentment because it is not your job. Eating disorders take so much from us and it is really nice to have some things remain "normal". 

In summary; be there for her. Be encouraging, be kind, if she wants to talk about it listen but also be the positive distraction in her life and try to maintain a sense of normality. When I was in residential, calls from my boyfriend were the highlight of my days because I knew that he wouldn't try to make me talk about my feelings or food, or ask me about my EKG and blood work, he would treat me like a normal person and tell jokes and talk to me about the nerdy stuff that we both like. In a world that revolved around recovery and anorexia, its really great to have somebody who treats you like a normal person. Make sure that she knows that you care and are always there if she needs support but don't let the ED take over your relationship.  </TEXT>

I think that you could rock a strong brow and a light contour to bring out your cheekbones. You also have really good eyes for eyeliner, so you could totally do a cat eye or smokey eye (which would look amazing with a strong, red lip)

Your brows are really nice and well shaped so there isn't much to do there unless you wanted to go for a really strong brow and outline/fill them in a bit (because they are naturally pretty thick this would look good on your face) 

I would recommend using a super light foundation or even just a tinted bb cream since your skin is naturally pretty clear, and so your  freckles are still visible (I think they look good on you).

	<TEXT> Seeing fat pets just makes me sad! Dogs like being outside and running, and they can't do that when they are out of shape and their joints hurt. Sure, having a lethargic pet that lays around all day may be convenient for you, but it is not in the beset interest of the dog and they are unhappy living that kind of life. 

The highlight of my dogs day is getting outside for a run with me or going to the dog park to run around and smell new smells, why would I rob him of that because I'm lazy? 

Several of my moms friends actually lost weight (and kept it off) from walking their dogs twice a day once their kids went away to school and the responsibility was left to them. Its not super strenuous but even 1 or 2 miles a day can make a big difference (especially when your partner won't let you get away with skipping out!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After having to take almost 2 years off to recover from my eating disorder and related cardiac problems, I am returning to ballet in January! I have a lot of concerns but one of them is what to do with my hair, since the last time I danced I cut it very short and I am not sure what I am supposed to do with it. It is not in my eyes or on my neck (its like a long buzz cut, but curly) but I wasn't sure if I should wear a hairband to make myself look more feminine or try to smooth it down/back for class. 

I'm also looking for leotard recommendations! I am tall, reasonably thin (5'8'' and 125ish pounds) and pretty curveless except for my chest (I wear a 28/30DD bra somehow) so I'm looking for leotards that come up higher in the front and have decent support in that area. I'm still small enough that if a leotard has good support/compression I don't need a sports bra, but if I find a good one with less support I'd be willing to get over myself and buy one. My older ones still fit (most of them are small or medium) but I'm hoping to treat myself to some new ones :) 

I'm super excited to get back into it, which is probably why I am thinking of all of these superficial nonissues!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently in nursing school and there is a big push to be more inclusive as studies show that transpeople are really underserved when it comes to healthcare. A lot of doctors offices and hospitals are starting to ask for both biological sex (what you were assigned at birth) and gender identity/preferred pronouns. Medical care is one of the few times that what genitals a transperson has can be relevant, it informs what tests a doctor would order and is important for diagnosis (a transwoman presenting with urinary incontinence would still need a prostate exam, though the doctor should still refer to them by their chosen name and pronouns). 

We are taught to always treat patients with respect and dignity and for some, that includes using their chosen name and pronouns which I am 100% ok with.   </TEXT>

Healthcare is much more of a team effort, with different professionals (doctors, nurses, social workers etc.) all collaborating their different areas of knowledge to come up with the best plan for a patient, where movies tend to just show doctors barking orders at people who seem to have no idea why they are doing what they are doing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now I'm in school for my BSN (4 year nursing degree). Despite my past I have no interest in being a psych nurse to reach out to the emos of tomorrow. 

I was just on the tail end of emo so I am college aged. I honestly don't regret my emo phase, the pictures and shit I said was embarassing, but I was legitimately hurting at that time in my life and it helped me find friends who understood and cared about me when I felt like nobody else did. 
I was bullied a lot because I stood out, I'm tall, one of the few black kids in my school (the bullying was never racist but it did make me more commonly known), I was smart, nerdy as fuck and had shitty social skills. I think part of the reason I became emo is because I knew I would always stand out, so I wanted to control why I stood out. 

When you're bullied 13 or 14 with untreated depression, under treated anxiety and anorexia all of the adults telling you that it will get better sounds like bullshit because you have no evidence that it will and your problems feel so big. Its comforting to hear somebody say that yes the world sucks and nobody understands you and you're sad but someday, maybe it will suck less you just need to hang in there.  

I've since gotten help and though I still really struggle with anorexia and anxiety I got a full ride to one of my top colleges and I am studying to be a nurse (no, I'm not a cliche, I have no interest in psych nursing). I have supportive friends and I am happier than I ever believed I could be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do. 
I'm in recovery from anorexia and my doctor put me on birth control to make my body have a period because I had gone so long without one. I know its fucked up to be ashamed, I worked at Walgreens in high school and did not give a flying fuck what my customers were buying, I know that cashiers have better things to do than judge me but buying tampons and pads makes me feel like I'm admitting to the whole world that I have gotten fat. 

Its the same thing with my boobs, I know that they are natural and I come from a family with big boobs but I feel like they are just physical evidence of me being so lazy that fat accumulates on my chest for everyone to see.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally do! I am somebody who thrives on structure, I like having places that I have to be because it forces me to do other things like getting up and eating at concrete times. I also spend all day surrounded by friends so it is easier to get dragged into plans where as on weekends it is so easy to stay isolated in my room and ignore texts. 

I struggle on weekends because I have too much time to get things done and I have trouble getting started when there isn't a deadline. I have no reason to get out of bed so why shouldn't I? 

I also struggle with meals. I'm recovering from anorexia and its hard to make myself eat, especially when my schedule gets thrown off by sleeping in and there isn't any social pressure to do so.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pre-nursing vs Direct admit awkwardness </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-20 23:43:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a first year BSN student in a competitive university program. Though it is a direct admit program (28 percent of almost 1200 applications were offered spots) people who were not directly admitted can still take the prerequisites and compete for one of the 20 or so spots in the program. As much as I make an effort to be nice and supportive, a lot of the 'pre-nursing' students are pretty hostile towards direct admits and frequently complain that its unfair that they didn't get in, and imply that we don't deserve our spots, which is awkward because there is no way to respond to this without either sounding conceited or agreeing. I'm starting to feel bad because I started the program not 100 percent sure if I even wanted to be a nurse, I only applied because nursing was more competitive than pre-med and it would be easier to switch out than in. I have come to the conclusion that I do what to be a nurse but I feel undeserving of my spot when I hear these people who didn't get in talking about how nursing is their calling and the only thing they could ever do. The fact is, I do deserve my spot, I graduated near the top of my class from a competitive high school, had good test scores and took almost exclusively AP classes (including multiple sciences) starting my sophomore year. 
A lot of them are really struggling in the classes and to quell the tension I want to offer to help, but I worry that it could come across as condescending. 

Sorry about this mess of a post, I'm just looking for some advice and maybe somebody else who is in a similar position.  </TEXT>

I've been looking around for headbands and hats to wear but I'm not sure where to look. I don't want anything too expensive, and it would be awesome if anyone knows of hairbands that will stay on without much hair to grip. 
I like turban style wraps, but I'm open to almost anything. My style is pretty minimal so I can be pretty flexible with accessories, and I'm a college student so I can dress pretty casually.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Living with asthma for a relative noob </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-29 18:08:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm fairly new to asthma, beyond having pneumonia a few times and some mild exercise intolerance I didn't start having real breathing problems until I was about 15 and they have been getting progressively worse (I'm 18 now) 
I have had all of the convos with my doctor but I'd love some advice for people who actually live with asthma.

Is any amount of wheezing ok? Frequently, I will feel fine but when I start paying attention I will notice that I'm wheezing (ah, that lovely whistling sound). I know that it isn't good, but how problematic is it that I am able to tolerate this? I tend to minimize my issues (I don't want other people to think of me as s drama queen) so I don't usually use my rescue inhaler unless I'm actually struggling to breathe. 

Also: what are some indications that it's time to break out the neb? 

Oh, one more thing: The last few winters I've ended up with cold that get stuck in my chest for weeks and I end up on prednisone and doing the neb every 2-4 hours around the clock, is what I should expect from now on? How did you guys deal with this in college? 

Thank you so much!

	<TEXT> what are you guys thoughts on bringing your neb to college?
I have pretty well controlled asthma that has been getting worse with age. I got pneumonia a few times as a kid and had some trouble with exercise intolorence (I still ran track and danced) but as I've gotten older it's become more of an issue. My doctor thinks it is because I've struggled with anorexia and would purge.
Last winter was the first time I needed the neb sincey childhood pneumonia, I got a cold that lingered in my chest and wouldn't clear up so I needed prednisone and the neb every 4 hours to clear it up. This happened twice. 

Basically I'm not sure if I should bring neb and prepare for the worst or just wait it out and if need be go to the doctor to get treatments or have my parents ship it. I think some of my hesitancy is from insecurity, I still don't like admitting that I have asthma that isn't just using my inhaler before I run, it's a part of my life and I need to take precautions.
Thanks for any advice you can offer!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! 
I am a very bony person which makes some poses very uncomfortable. I've discovered that putting a towel on my mat for extra padding and putting my mat on carped can make things like bow pose (it would really hurt my hip bones) more tolerable but I still haven't found ways to modify crow pose and others on that nature to make them tolerable (boney legs+boney arms=ouch) 
Should I just learn to deal with this discomfort or is there a way to deal with it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is getting my BSN first a good idea? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-04 17:17:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am unsure if I want to ultimately become a nurse practitioner or an MD. I am starting college in the fall in a competitive BSN program, and plan on taking the classes required for pre-med over the summers and during the year because I have a fair number of free credits because of AP exams. Do you think getting my BSN first is the best choice to keep my options open? I thought it would be a good plan because it allows me to get a job right out of school (which would be hard with a degree in bio on a pre-med track) and it starts me on the path to become an NP, though I'm concerned that it may put me at a disadvantage should I choose med school. 
Any advice?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My dad has been verbally and emotionally abusive for as long as I can remember. I didn't even think of it as abuse for quite some time, and I'm only now realising how affected I was by it. I have been aware that the early abuse contributes to my low self esteem because I was too young to understand that adults aren't always right. Its very confusing for me, because he doesn't acknowledge any of the stuff he has done, and just when I got over my guilt about my desire to not have a relationship, he decided that he wanted one and basically forces me into it with Emom (who I have a super positive relationship outside of him) telling the that I'm hurting his feelings when I shut him down. He can be really nice sometimes, he has always provided for my family and gotten me material things, and I honestly feel like he tries to be a good parent (and thinks he is a good parent) but just can't control his anger. 
I'm just getting more and more angry as I get older and realize how he has effected me while he constantly invalidates me. For instance, I have anorexia and spent time in residential treatment this year and he recently told me that I need to "get over this and just eat because he spent a lot of time and money getting me treatment and doesn't want to deal with this kind of stress from me". 
I don't even know what this post is about, I've finally started working on this in therapy and I'm struggling with coming to terms with how traumatic (I don't like using that word) this has been.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Do you recommend rooming with other nursing majors freshman year? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-09 14:08:50 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hello!
I'm going to begin my freshman year of college as a nursing major this August! I'm super excited, but as I have been looking into housing I was wondering, do you think it would be best to live with another nursing major, another non-nursing science major, or somebody in a completely unrelated major. I can see advantages and disadvantages to both, living with somebody in my major could be great for studying and support since they "get it", but it could also lead to competition, and just feeling like I can't escape nursing. I'm leaning towards having someone who is majoring in a science other than nursing so we can help each other with some stuff, share some of the same stresses, but not be in direct competition. 
Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now, I have bronchitis (as a result of having asthma and getting a winter cold), and I have been unable to sleep. I'm on nebulized albuterol sulfate every 4 hours (even in the middle of the night), my rescue inhaler as needed and 60 MG daily of prednisone (30 MG twice a day, I'm a rather petite college aged girl). 
I have been unable to sleep because I feel so wired, but I know if I skip a treatment I will be up coughing and wheezing. Does anyone have any tips for how to get some sleep?  </TEXT>
