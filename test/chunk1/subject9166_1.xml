All that work to get Bran there MUST mean something about Bran must be unique/special, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From 1995 to 2004 my family and I used to live at various tea estates in the northern part of West Bengal, India. Normally the managers, assistant managers etc live at british era bungalows in the middle of the estates, so there's just this one house with possibly several kilometres of just tea bushes. Plus that area is intermingled with forests housing leopards, panthers and the like. Cobras and other snakes are standard procedure. The worst thing was that all around there were just bushes of tea, forming an opaque layer of green, and you'd have NO idea what was roaming underneath. 
Very often when driving home from saturday club meetings we'd sometimes witness a jaguar casually walk across the road. Once a colleague of my father was on his bike travelling alone when a leopard leapt from the bushes, used him as a platform and jumped into the bushes on the other side. His shoulders bore the deep cuts from the claws. 

Apart from terrifying animal encounters, you had your ghost stories. A bungalow that my family stayed at in the Diana Tea Estate was particularly notorious. I don't know if it had a backstory but people were really afraid of it. Guests we had at the house could never switch the lights off to sleep. Once we had an uncle of mine stay there and he swore that someone kept pulling the blanket away repeatedly during the night. There were also giant snails in the bathroom. Creepy as fuck imo. Throughout most of this I was a little kid so I guess PERSONALLY I haven't had an experience like that. Even if I did I doubt I'd identify it as one. Wouldn't live there alone now as an adult, for sure.

Let me throw in this one as a bonus. This did happen I'm sure but I'll have to google a fair bit if you guys want a source, because it's a story told to me in about 2008 or 07 by a friend of my dad, and it took place not long before that. 
Okay so at tea estates there are very often conflicts between the management and the labours, or the labours and the tribals, and the like. Shit can get violent fast. I remember when we had to stay at a hotel at Siliguri because our estate was locked down because of a conflict between the labours and the management. Anyways, THIS guy used to work at a tea estate that came into conflict with the tribals. One night when he was driving home with his wife, the tribals stopped him midway and killed them both, chopping their bodies. 

EDIT: Tried to find a source on that but failed. The guy killed was a mutual friend of the person who told the story and my dad though so he wouldn't lie I think, or be misinformed.

	<TITLE> Laptop screen divided into 6 identical copies. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This started a few days ago, no action on my side as far as I can think that caused it. 
Right from BIOS to Windows, the screen remains split into 6 identical copies of the desktop with a thick black band down the centre dividing them.

My brother and I actually use different 120 GB Hard disks; his with an updated version of Windows 8.1 and mine on dual boot with Windows 7 and an older version of Windows 8.1 . When the problem first came up I assumed it wouldnt be there when I booted up with my HDD but there it was.

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the video adapter driver and it DID actually solve the problem for 2 restarts, and then the solution failed.

I doubt that it's a motherboard issue because the problem goes away while tinkering with the driver, seemingly randomly, but returns with a reboot. There ARE some issues with the wiring in the LCD panel (glitchy display when the screen is moved by the hinge.)

All other laptop functions are unimpaired. 

Any solutions? This is my last hope.

Laptop specs:
2008 Compaq Presario C700
3 GB RAM,
1.5 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor.
NO GPU.
128 mb shared Video Memory (might be 256, not sure.)
Never had this issue before. </TEXT>

This line strikes me as very odd. I'm in the same boat as you, with a 2007 laptop that was shitty even in it's time. Bouncing tracks saves a huge amount of CPU, man. You're doing something wrong there. Bouncing is the only way that hardware challenged people like us can stand up to the better equipped producers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A 2008 or '09 Compaq Presario c700. 
1.5 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 3 GB RAM, no graphics card, overheating lil piece of shit. No chance of upgrading in the foreseeable future.

Suffice to say, production is a challenge. Can only dream of layering as much as I want. Reduced to working with the bare minimum, extensive bussing. I'm vary of bouncing to audio though because I tend to keep tweaking the song structure. Can't really use Serum because it eats the CPU like it's dessert. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Harry Potter fan account holder here, fairly large following on Twitter; 
the HP fandom has been pretty sensible up till now but suddenly like a month ago more than half the fandom has been supporting this strange forced ultra diversity in the cast, some even going as far as to imply JKR is racist because the students of Hogwarts don't accurately represent the statistical demographics, and that every person isn't a different sexual orientation :s
been fuckin weird. </TEXT>

As for my opinion, I'm sort of in the same spot as you right now. But it's the cleanliness of my mixes that I just can't get to sound like how I want, instead of the loudness. I think I'll just keep working until I can get it at a level that satisfies me. So I think you should do the same. Work on it until you're satisfied.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Come on, I'm gonna need a source for cred on Ned's fighting skills being that weak. If he was that weak he'd by dead by now. The guy lead his entire region on a bloody rebellion. And had enormous respect from almost all his bannermen. Surely the north-men wouldn't respect a weak fighter that much.
And didn't Robb fight in his battles against the Lannisters? Pretty wildly too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well to be fair we've never really seen Ned in any actual battle action. Seeing as how Robb was pretty well trained and assuming Ned was the same at that age, I think I'd say Ned would be a pretty strong fighter. Maybe not as much as Jaime, but not very behind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. The whole 'revenge for your brother's sister and their kids' story would've DEFINITELY earned him her respect and a place in her council. But for some reason this obvious benefit was just casually disregarded by both Doran and Oberyn and instead they sent their frog prince to woo her :s

Edit: In fact, I'm confident that the revenge story was all that would've been needed to forge this huge alliance :/

	<TEXT> Hey guys, I've read a lot about how many club systems are in mono and so your track should be mono compatible but I had sort of just forgotten about it. I checked and my track sounds like shit on mono. How do I solve this? Or should I even bother with this issue? I've got tons more to worry about, ha ha. 

EDIT: Read about the issue on the Izotope support site. Apparently it IS a problem to be solved. How do I go about this quickly? And how do I make sure my tracks are mono compatible as I go along writing them?

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the answers, guys. This has been really helpful. I'll try to make things sound good in mono but if they don't, no sweat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The last scene of this episode. Right after Daenerys is gloriously flying away on Drogon, the camera focuses on Tyrion, looking on with a somewhat blank reaction, and then everyone else comes into view: Jorah, Daario and Missandei, with Tyrion being the focus. 

Many people believe that Tyrion will eventually ride a dragon. I feel like this scene tilts the argument a little bit in favour of the theory. </TEXT>
