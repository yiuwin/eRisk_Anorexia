	<TEXT> That's good to know. I'm not a religious person in any way. I grew up in a very religious house and, to be honest, it made things harder for me to try and pretend to believe something that I just don't. That's something that I was really worried about with the whole meeting aspect of it. I don't know. It just really, really scares me and I'm not sure I'm ready for that step you know?

I'm trying to find other outlets and such. But.. I don't know. I just haven't been able to 100% yet. I mean, I'm only 18. I feel like this is supposed to be the time in my life where I'm DOING things and living life. And yet.. I'm not. I feel like I don't even know how to anymore. Maybe that sounds a little bit stupid. But I don't know how else to explain it. It just scares me for some reason. </TEXT>

Thank you for the support.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your support and advice. I don't really have that many friends who are 100% sober. I kind of lost touch with the ones I did have when I got further and further into my own addiction. I feel like that might be the hardest part for me, even beyond physical withdrawals. I just feel like getting clean is going to be so lonely..

I know there are NA meetings in my area, but for some reason I'm just really intimidated by them. Already though people on this subreddit have been so supportive and that's helped. I don't think I would have even made it a week if I hadn't found this. Thanks again for the advice and support. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess making changes really shows you who your true friends are and who they aren't. I know if I'm around most of the people I've been friends with since I started using, I'll never be able to get out because a lot of them abuse some sort of substance as well. It just seems really awful to think of having no friends at all, especially while trying to stay strong and get clean you know?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted a couple days ago about how I was trying to get clean for the first time. Thank you to everyone who responded. This has basically been my only source of support. I was doing pretty well. I mean, I felt awful and I was struggling, but I wasn't taking.

Unfortunately, a couple days ago I was hanging out with a friend that I also buy from. He asked when I was going to buy again. I told him I probably wasn't because I'm trying to get clean. He gushed about how proud and how happy for me he was. He then proceeded to offer to spot me some for free "just in case I need them." I told him no. Sadly, when I got home later that night, I found what he had offered in my purse. I guess he must have slipped them in when I wasn't paying attention. I couldn't bring myself to get rid of them. I don't know why not. I just..couldn't.

I made it through the night and the next day. But then I just broke and got high again. I made it a week. I'm trying really hard to not let this completely derail all my progress (however slight and small it may have been. I know a week isn't very long) I thought I was through the hardest parts of physical withdrawals and such. Can anyone tell me if it will just reset or if they'll be less severe this time around? Any advice on avoiding relapses in the future? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really know what I'm supposed to say here. I'm on day 4 clean. I know that isn't long. But it's longer than I've gone in what seems like forever. Thing is, I'm really scared I can't make it much longer. I have basically zero support. All of my friends use (not all opiates but something at least). My family doesn't know. My anxiety is getting really out of hand. I'm shaking; my body feels like I'm dying. 

I don't know what to do or how to even go about getting clean. I'm just trying to stay strong.. But I'm really scared I'll break..

Honestly, any advice at all would be more than welcome.

Thanks so much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I recently found out that I guy who raped and abused me 2 years ago is facing charges. The girl who is pressing the charges approached me and asked if I would want to get involved in the case. After a lot of thought I decided it was time to speak up and do the right thing. 

I knew it had been too long to have enough evidence to open my own case, but I still wanted to see if I could help in any way. I contacted the Victim's Advocate working on the case. She told me that I could possibly become a witness of previous wrong doings and testify against him, and to contact the deputy who was running the investigation.

I called the deputy to get some more information on what I needed to do. I told him what case I was looking to get involved with and what the victim's advocate had said. He then started to ask me a few questions. He asked what my interaction with the guy had been and what I was trying to report. 

I told him that the guy being charged had raped me.

He the responded by saying, "Well are you sure? Or was he just being a little rude? Because if we was just being mean the law can't do anything about it and you need to go somewhere else for help."

...Excuse me?? I'm pretty sure I know the difference between freaking rape and someone being "a little rude." 

If you're going to be working in law enforcement regarding this sort of thing you should probably work on not being a dick. Goddamn police.

	<TEXT> When I was 15 I met a boy who was 18. We started dating.

After a few months, he hit me for the first time. It went downhill from there.

Two months after that, he raped me.

One month later I broke up with him.

Now, a year and a half later, I work at my local CAPSA (Community Abuse Prevention Services Agency) branch. I go to schools and other organizations giving presentations on healthy relationships and knowing the signs of an abusive relationship as well as tips to get out of it. Each time I have girls come up to me and thank me for sharing my story. I love that. I'm trying hard to take my horrible situation and somehow make it a positive. I'm trying to be strong and help others. But truth is, this is the first time I've talked about it to anyone. On average I do 6-8 presentations a week. It's way more emotional than I thought it would be. It's starting to get super overwhelming. But they keep asking me to do more and talk to more people. I want to help. But I'm scared if I don't take a break, I'll break under the pressure. I need to get some help to figure out how to deal with this. But I'm scared to tell them that. I'm scared I'll come off as selfish and unwilling to help.

I don't know what to do. </TEXT>
