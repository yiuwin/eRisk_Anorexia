	<TEXT> The "urge to purge orally" was present for a few moments.

I didn't think this would be a "higher dosage" - only 37mg! But I cannot imagine being able to tolerate much more.

I snorted about 40mg a few weeks later and found it a totally different experience: I essentially just went into a vibratory trance and entered a dreamlike state. Perhaps a report about this shall be forthcoming, but I doubt I can remember it well enough for it to be nearly so compelling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was very harsh and horrible tasting. But also amazingly potent. Smoked out of a wooden pipe with a Bic. The vendor claims it to be HcL. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> DPT - 37mg smoked - trip report </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I placed approximately 37mg DPT HcL on a pipe and smoked in all in one large toke.

Prior to total exhalation I feel as though I have been thrown headfirst into the plateau of a 12g Psilocybe cubensis trip. More than ever before, at first, do I feel like I am going crazy, like it is far beyond what I could handle; after a few minutes I manage to recollect myself and deal with the experience of this chemical.

I begin to look around and see perfectly circular holes forming in the fields on this dark and scary night. The dense fog which had initial encouraged me to attempt this, my first DPT experience, gives a most haunting aura thereunto. The baseball diamond feels like the landing site of a UFO and as I walk I see dinosaur fossils underneath my feet in the its sand. 

A soundtrack, simultaneously phantasmagorical while also strangely peaceful due to long- and mostly-forgotten memories, plays on Spotify: The X-Files album, and the ambiance of my trip alternates in accordance aurally therewith. I walk out of the field and head for the water fountain, the taste forcing me to counter the urge to purge orally; ultimately, I think it is a change in the sounds which overcomes this unpleasantness. 

My body is very warm, despite it being so cold a night, and so I undo my zipper and then my buttons. My mind is being tortured both internally and externally: in the former case, by the seeds of the notion of insanity; while, in the latter, the appearance of distinct sets of raccoon eyes all around me, hovering in space. This sensation I find to be unique to DPT; on other tryptamines the eyes that appear - and appear they almost always do - are formed into physical objects such as trees or the grass, but not now. Instead, they simple exist for ephemeral glances all around me, here and there, up and down, floating in the foggy sky most eerily. 

After walking around the block I am returned to the park. The X-Files continues to play, but mostly on a specific song, the one I find to be the cheerful-most of the assortment, which I am continuously repeating manually, as difficult as that is to do with my hands being so alien an appendage at this time. As I stand here I feel as though I am being raised through the air, ascending into the Heavens like the Messiah, and look around to see the roofs of the houses and the school in the distance. Upon taking a step forward I seem to have returned to Earth: gravity's defiance is now defied.

After forty minutes the experience seems to be easing significantly. Feeling capable of doing so without causing too great a disturbance, I decide to go home. The sensation of walking through a primaeval burial ground permeating the ground all about me continues to pervade my mind, and this gives it some slight sort of feeling of the state of being connected to an ancient past. This reminds me retrospectively of 4-HO-MiPT, during which I felt as though I was walking through an alien forest, the first human ever to perform such a quest. But in that case everything physically present in my milieu looked to be extraterrestrial, while in this case the holograms of primordial remains appear as though on a screen within the ground upon which I am walking, ever shifting: it is at times like watching a cave painting turned into a film. 

The rest of the night is spent in profound tranquility, though sleep remains distant for several hours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Insufflation of 4-HO-MET is the best. I've done it twice, both times with between 10 and 15mg, and always enjoyed it. Lasts about two hours; not too visual, and usually with a rather jolly headspace. 

Debating between doing 20mg next week or maybe trying out 10mg of 4-HO-DET, a new one for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there even any point to such a question? I mean, LSD is LSD is LSD. 5-MeO-MiPT is bleh. Never liked it. Kinda sickening; not a clean feel whatsoever.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> MPT experiment - 47mg vaped </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Tried vaporizing 47mg of MPT out of a glass freebase pipe. Didn't feel much. Probably didn't hold in the smoke long enough. So I tried another toke. Tastes like the usual DMT-analog fare. 

I got up and started walking. The one primary effect noted was that the sidewalks seemed to have these weird, snake-like patterns, and shadows/contrasts seemed to jump out. Not much headspace.

After 20 minutes I got to another park and tried another toke, this time holding in longer. Same effects but only slightly more pronounced. One time I thought I saw somebody coming out from behind a building and had quite the scare. Thoughts were slightly disorderly and speech was mildly impaired, but seemingly more so from the horrible taste than from any real intoxication.

Will try again. </TEXT>
