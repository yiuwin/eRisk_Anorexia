	<TITLE> Synthetics and treatments </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-12 01:33:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What are your thoughts on synthetics and treatments? I'm a hard no on synthetics. Treatments, on the other hand, are almost unavoidable. 

Heat treatment of corundum (ruby, sapphire) and oiling of beryl (emerald) is fairly standard and quality stones with these treatments are still very valuable. Any time of glass fracture filling, diffusion, etc. is a definite no for me. 

Thoughts?

Also, on some of my posts, people have been telling me I'm an idiot for preferring natural stones when synthetics provide the same beauty at a fraction of the cost. 

My response to that is *intrinsic value*. A gold filled item is worth an insignificant amount of money, while a solid gold item has considerable value. There is a highly limited supply of gold, but there is an abundance of the elements used as based metals in gold filled items. 

Similarly, there is a limited supply of natural gemstones and an abundance of synthetics. Price comes down to low supply and high demand. Sorry for rambling, just my two cents.

	<TEXT> I recommend you start not by collecting gems, but by collecting knowledge. Learn as much as you can about varieties, origins, treatments, color, cut, clarity, carat size, lab reports, etc. 

Once you have a good foundation of knowledge, compare prices for several stones you are interested in, negotiate and buy what you like at the price you want!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are many more factors that go into account. The stone linked sold for $30,000,000. A 1 carat, true pigeon blood ruby with loupe clean clarity, an ideal cut, and of Burmese origin will cost somewhere in the $30,000 range. A D-FL, ideal cut diamond will run about half that. 

Each additional carat more than doubles the value of the stone. Unheated rubies of fine color and clarity over 10 carats are all but unheard of. Other than fancy diamonds, jadeite, and a few others, unheated ruby is the most expensive gemstone on the planet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, no problem. I could talk about gems for hours. When it comes to colored stones, it's all about color. The $12,000 one is better, but still far from true "pigeon blood red". It's a bit dark. 

[This](http://www.sothebys.com/content/dam/stb/lots/GE1/GE1502/GE1502-502.jpg) is an example of "pigeon blood red". Some day... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because of the Burmese origin. Natural, unheated ruby is actually rare (unlike the 400% marked up diamonds you see in Zales). It's definitely not a top stone but looks better in more flattering light and less close-up.  </TEXT>

It's all about adding value to your item. Selling it at an auction house rather than on eBay, selling it certified, selling it set in jewelry, etc.

	<TEXT> Price is purely supply and demand and beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I collect because I love gemstones, especially rare ones. I collect many gemstones people have never heard of (poudretteite, painite, benitoite, musgravite, taaffeite, etc.) as well as rare versions of popular gems (large rubies, sapphires, emeralds, etc.). 

Also, these stones are definitely investments. Emerald has appreciated ~255% over the past [11 years or so]
(http://www.gemval.com/history.php?hsid=9 term=2).

If you are ever in the market for a stone of this caliber, make sure you get a laboratory certificate. This stone comes with one from [GRS](http://imgur.com/a/wbFos). GIA, AGL, Gubelin, SSEF, AIGS, etc. are all reputable gem labs. They rely on their standards and reputation to bring them (sometimes) less business at higher prices, rather than more business at lower prices. 

Avoid IGI, ~~AGL~~ EGL, "Appraisals" or most other "labs". They don't have the same standards as those large labs. These labs will often overstate quality factors in order to create loyalty among their customers (gem sellers). Hurting you as the end consumer as a result.

3. She's only 17, this man was huge. 
4. You have been trained to deal with this stuff, she's still in high school. 

Nobody is saying your job is easy. I'm sure sometimes it can be downright awful but this was as an in-person threat. I hope you can find an outlet to deal with the stress of your job, PM me if you need to talk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my experience, employers who treat their employees well, encourage, and engage them are the employers that employees are happy to work for. 

70% of wealthy families lose their wealth in one generation, 90% in two. People who are born rich think the world should be putty in their hands. Bending to their every whim. 

That is why they often terribly manage employees. They have never been in their shoes. Never had to struggle.
