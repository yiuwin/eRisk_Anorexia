	<TEXT> From my own experience, it made me lose interest in my hobbies because I was constantly surrounded by it. It's really refreshing to be around people with different interests who don't want to talk about the hobby you have in common all the time. Over time, the value of the hobby becomes a little lost and then you find you just don't love it that much anymore </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My partner is like 8", I'm fairly sure I'm under 5". Yes, we do measure his dick more. Honestly, couldn't care less about the size. Sure talking about it and seeing it is fun, but he reacts the same with mine. Many times he's actually complained about his size. If the roles were reversed I don't think he'd care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have a shared account where our incomes go into and then we take a percentage out of that account to go to two different savings accounts - one is to pay off university and a down payment on a house and the other is an emergency fund/holiday fund in that part of what doesn't get used at the end of the year goes towards a holiday together. The money left in our savings pays bills, groceries etc and if we want to purchase things we talk about it. Neither of us are particularly materialistic and we leave this money there to be spent so we can't just say "Why did you buy more shoes when we could have saved the money?" Previously we did 50/50 until I was the only one earning money so i did 100%, but neither of us are frivolous spenders and we buy most of our stuff cheap and online so it's easy to just ask if it's okay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take the 'passive' role mainly because he's a whole foot taller and about 90 pounds more muscle mass. The most passive thing I do is make him open jars and reach high places because I'm too busy making dinner to grab a chair. 

I don't think I could ever be in a relationship where I am vulnerable. There are times he picks me up and does things for me that are particularly masculine. Maybe because I can't lift him up and carry him bridal style or I really don't want to get oil accidentally leaking onto me when fixing up the car. Or maybe I can't be the big spoon because I'm tiny. But there was none of powerplay bullshit. We are equals and I'd carry him bridal style if I ever get jacked. </TEXT>

If you answer no to the first then it would be an impulsive decision based on opportunity and with the false hope that you will somehow be happier with this guy. Only break up with people because the relationship isn't fulfilling, not because you think something better has come up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on what you consider small to be. I'm around 5". Been a bottom all my life except maybe twice. Hmmm...never really had issues with it. The important thing to have is sexual confidence, when people see you are confident they are more focused on that rather than any potential flaws you may have. The pro with having a small dick is you get better blow jobs. Cons....size queens? I never really encountered any because I bottom, but there was one time a dude was being rude about it, so I just grabbed my clothes and left. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, when my partner and I got together we had nothing in common in terms of hobbies and we even act differently. But the one thing we had in common were our values and the fact that we were for some reason always happy together and genuinely enjoyed each other's company. A lot of relationship crisises occur because you don't enjoy being together as much as you should, poor communication or because you are too caught up on the superficial notion of what it means to have a fulfilling relationship. All you need is good communication and enjoyment. That's it. None of that star sign or he likes different movies crap. 

Also, keep in mind that someone who is very similar to you and would make for a good friend can become an exhausting partner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the real world, if a landlord said no smoking on the property (and it's in the contract) and you smoked, you'd be kicked out, lose your $1000+ bond, potentially have to pay up legal fees and worse. There are very major consequences if you break any rule. I understand your father is trying to help you understand what it is like and how such a simple thing is cause for huge issue, but his method of action is wrong. Try looking at social service facilities for LGBT individuals in your area to get help finding a place to stay. It can take weeks if not months to be approved as a tenant and they can even help arrange roommates. 

Look up craigslist and roommate search websites for cheaper stays. I'm not going to advise on what to do in regards to your dad, opening up a legal case now whilst you are homeless is difficult as it is both costly and time consuming. Get a police report if you can though.  </TEXT>

Obviously, I know you aren't going to say "Hey, just act straight." but rather, "My partner's family is very anti-gay and I wouldn't want any conflict, so please just be a little careful." Typically, just dropping the 'anti-gay people are there' bomb would be enough for my brain to go 'cool, I won't talk about having a husband, just a partner and not mention their gender/won't talk to those people.' I honestly have no idea why people here are suddenly defensive. Do you really spray your gay everywhere you go? The gayest visible thing about me is my husband, and most of the time people think we're just friends.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't play hard to get if you want a relationship with someone. If you do, they'll think you're flaky and unreliable. Everything you do from day 1 is like a job interview. You need to show them tiny bits of what you want and what you have to offer and see whether or not they are into that. Lying by being someone you are not - playing hard to get - will only get guys who want that and once they are in a relationship they end up with someone who doesn't want to be that way. 

Be upfront with people. Don't play games unless you want to end up with someone who plays games on you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn the comments here are asinine. We are talking about children. Parental pressure which is directed at self-confidence and diminishing someone's self-esteem and devaluing to their achievements can lead to so many horrible consequences such as depression, panic disorder and self-handicapping behaviours. No not all children will turn out that way, but a lot will. It is more important to encourage your children to seek out hobbies and foster what they choose. I am sure OP is isn't saying that if you get Fs and someone else were to dare get an A your parents have a right to say "Well if they got an A I'm sure you can too Billy." No, this is more to the extent of, "Oh you got an A, well this kid just built a fusion reactor. Why can't you do that?" 

Children are much more sensitive to feelings of inadequacy. Just throw 'parental pressure' and 'the effect of comparing children' into google or google scholar and you will find so much in favour of this LPT. Too lazy? Read [here](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-06/byu-pcm061615.php) and [here](http://hubpages.com/family/How-Comparing-One-Child-To-Another-Negatively-Affects-A-Child).

If you were raised conservative and were told to dress a particular way and notingle with those who don't and you wanted your boyfriend/girlfriend who you love dearly to make a good impression because they are wholly deserving of your parent's approval, would you too not want them to be polished and dressed in a way your parents will approve? Meeting parents is like a job interview, the first impression is everything. While the choice of words is terrible and they both sound immature in how they handled it, it's a matter of respect, saving face and making a good impression. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone has a default body shape that they can't really change or it takes a shit tonne of work to change. Part of it has to do with bone structure and they way fat sits on your body even the shape of your muscles! The key to body defaults is effort - it requires no effort for me to be lean and thin because genetics, however if I wanted to bulk and be shredded I'd need to do the whole steroids and protein and lifting weights for 5 hours a day, whereas for some people 2 hours a day without a diet or drug change is all it takes, but if they want to be lean like me they'd need to eat lettuce and do aerobics while I'm sitting here eating a whole chocolate cake and watching it go no where. 

I essence, you can change it. Women who don't have hourglass curves either get surgery or wear corsets because diet and exercise actually won't change shape as well as we are told sometimes. But the ability and effort required to make that change is huge </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess it may depend on the university. Mine is ranked 46th in the world and is in the top 20 for engineering and psychology. We barely have the culture of grad students being 'better' than undergrads and not mingling. You find a lot of grad students instead doing courses for undergrads just for fun or as filler units. Most of them tutor classes or students, but the dynamic of power distance isn't huge. I haven't exactly met anyone who would date an undergrad or postgrad based on the idea of age or educational rank. Keep in mind, a lot of undergrads are tied to degrees which require postgrad (medicine, psychology, health sciences etc) </TEXT>

I'm doing my masters at the moment and a lot of the queer Ph.Ds and the like still hang out at the queer society and get involved with the university life. But I mean if you really want to avoid them, I guess you could just ask them through online dating. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey. This is an odd subreddit for me to post into because about 3 months ago, the bedroom was hella alive. For some reason, my sex drive has gone. I've been having endocrine problems - interaction between stress, low blood pressure, Australian summer and medication (SSRIs) - and for the past 3 months, I've been disinterested in sex.  The last time we had sex was on New Years and over the past 3 months we've only had sex maybe 3-4 times. I know, doesn't sound very dead. But we're both 21, and we're both male so this complete lack of any intimacy is very strange.

I know I could just have sex with him to make him feel better about himself, but the last time I did something like that he felt awful for 'forcing me'. I tried talking it out, but every time we talk now it's just an endless stream of arguments. Just recently he accused me of cheating. Some people will call this a red flag, but 7 months ago he had a spinal injury when serving which put him in a wheelchair so his esteem has dropped dramatically. It's making my lack of interest in sex or fooling around look like he's unattractive to me now, which isn't true. 
He sometimes says things about him weighing me down or me deserving better. 

tl;dr: husband is in a wheelchair and thinks me not wanting sex has to do with him being in a wheelchair, cheating on him or no longer loving him. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I mean, I'm practically living off ramen anyway. But we're saving up for a home because we're aging and need to act like adults. This will be used for my small business which involves doing some design work and my partner's engineering projects which involve crazy ass programs I will never understand oh and gaming. Lots of it. Basically 99% gaming, 1% cat videos.

Here are 2 builds I've assembled on PCPartpicker. One is AMD the other is Intel. I'm new to this building thing, but my partner knows everything but I can't even trust him with making coffee in the morning so I need you guys' help here. 

Also, I'm hoping to get a good build between $1000-$2000 . Hopefully closer to $1000. I have the philosophy that the cost of the PC should outlive it's price in days, so $1000 = 3 years of no upgrade/major fixing, $2000 = 6 years etc. If you could cheapen either of these up, or completely redesign them to make them more cost effective, that would be awesome.

	<DATE> 2014-08-15 04:37:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My first time building now that I am finally switching from consoles to PC. Here's the build: http://i.imgur.com/YFl6nd2.png

I can swap out the power supply for a Zalman 650w 80+ Gold for roughly $20 extra, but not sure if it will support the rest of my rig. Also, I'm contemplating if I can drop the SSD entirely since there is already a 1TB SSHD, alternately, I can change the SSHD to a Western Digital 1TB HDD and keep the SSD? 
I may have added things that are too 'high tech' for my uses like the 16GB DDR3 and probably could get away with 8GB RAM?

I play a lot of games that demand a lot of memory capacity purely because of graphics. My mum also likes to play Sims and we all know that that thing near rivals Watch Dogs with how demanding it is! I'm also a bit of an artist and paint a lot using Photoshop CS5 and my 4GB RAM on my ultrabook is okay I guess, it reaches a point about 1 hour in where it starts jittering and slows down a lot. Then again, it IS an ultrabook.
Help for the noob is appreciated. </TEXT>
