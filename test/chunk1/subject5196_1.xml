	<TEXT> I don't think this is true.  He's absorbed some shots lately.  It's been a long time since the four fight losing streak.  

But, I think his attempts at a title run ended tonight. By the time he could get back up there, you'd think that Jones might be making that switch in divisions, and I don't think he'd compete with his teammate.  

Though he didn't seem to care about getting in Overeem's way _ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really just...can't.

I spent the evening at a bar watching the TCU game with fellow alumni. It was incredible.  Had a great time, but I kept looking at the clock and realizing I wasn't going to make it home in time to watch Arlovski.  

Made a mad dash to a bar nearby. Got there just in time for the walkouts.  And...just numb.  

I had such a great night, and then the wind just rushed out.  

I feel so sorry for him, I really do.  It was such a great story.  I hate to see it end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't be anything but disappointed. Sorry GRRM. I've dedicated years of my life to reading those books.  The show is just bonus material.  The idea that I now have to choose between them is a bit of a punch to the gut, and no, I'm not happy nor satisfied. 

Oh well...it's just a book, right...right?

That being said, I like the story itself, and I'm very excited by the premise and look forward to finishing it.  Once I get over the narration, I expect to enjoy this a bit more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That bitch knew we weren't friends, but showed up as a +1 for a mutual friend anyways.  While I was in the bathroom changing out of my wedding gown into my street clothes at the end of the night, I overheard her speaking to one of my friends, unaware that I was in there, saying, "Did you *ever* imagine you'd be at *subject5196's* wedding of all people?" in the kind of way where she was clearly suggesting that it was absurd that anyone would ever have married me.  I walked out of the bathroom stall, and just went, "Heeeeeyyy!" and walked away.

	<TEXT> Which I do not disagree with in the slightest. What I said was that I find it strange to suggest that there are some classics that are less valuable because their genre is Romance. Which is what it seemed you were saying. 

I would also not want an entire month of just romance classics.  

But if classics are being recommended every month AND getting their own month, I'm not SUPER thrilled with the idea. It doesn't matter, it's all for fun anyways, and to get some ideas for stuff to read, so I'm happy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely agree.  My grandmother was a very unique individual when it came to cooking.  There was always an unwritten rule in my family not to ask what was in the cookies and other sweets she made, because she ran the gamut from lard (something my millennial cousins and I just weren't used to eating) to hard candies.  Sometimes the things she made were disasters, sometimes they were pure gold.  But they're certainly impossible to duplicate.  The most pleasant of memories when I think of all the time I spent in her kitchen over the years.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I see stuff like this I find it so frustrating. I'm 5'1", and a year ago I weighed nearly 200 pounds. I got down to 136 by fairly strictly counting calories (1200 per day) and doing 30minutes of cardio 5 days a week. 

I didn't change my diet outside of cutting down, and the exercising took nearly no time out of my day. 

I'm back to 140 right now because the holidays, and I'm not counting very strictly, and maintaining fairly easily. 

I have fairly difficult menstrual cycles, and I'm on medication that can cause weight gain, but so far, once I actually buckled down and focused, it took hardly any effort to get down to simply being overweight, rather than obese. 

I just continue to try and tell my story to people in the hopes that they'll give it a try. 

So many apps out there that make calorie counting simple.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll tell you what, I had zero expectations for Krampus, I was just excited to see the folklore getting a movie made.  Saw it tonight at the local dollar theater, and I was REALLY impressed.  Not sure I liked the ending, but the rest of the movie was just aces.  Very pleased, and probably now a seasonal staple for me. 

Other pleasant surprises, mentioned in the thread many times already: Kingsmen, Ex-Machina and Spy.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Arlovski Christmas video /Some interesting insight to his's fight camp </TITLE>

	<TEXT> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzYVfcLYNZk

It's a nice Christmas video, but I think there's something interesting in here as well, that was hinted at in his " don't want to be rude, but f**k all the people" interview from earlier this year (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjH_5pStB4I) 

He's not doing as much media this time around, and he's claimed before that he didn't take Mir seriously, had a lot of friends in town, had Embedded going, was doing his own fight logs as well, and in general seemed to be goofing off an awful lot. 

I love Arlovski a lot, but I was definitely not putting much faith in him to beat Miocic, but hearing that he's bringing in more coaches, focusing down, I'm getting pretty hyped. 

Anyways, more of a fluff post, but it's a little interesting fight wise as well.  </TEXT>

Amirkhani, Parke, Svensson finally getting his shot, and Manuwa with a chance at fighting a real human being and not a madman with something to prove. 

Plus the Main Event, I'm excited.

	<TITLE> Questions from a new V1 owner. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-25 21:44:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone, 

I just have a few basic questions.  I had a lot of expectations for this watch, and with just under 48 hours of ownership, I'm already horribly disappointed.  

Let me preface this by saying that from the start, I never expected this thing to work exactly as I wanted.  I expected a heart rate monitor that was close to accurate, a pedometer that was close to accurate, a battery that survived my time at work, etc.  

What I'm getting instead is about 8 hours of battery life, a pedometer that only tracks my steps if I'm jogging and a heartrate monitor that apparently isn't monitoring on its own.  

I was on the elliptical for 25 minutes yesterday.  The wear logged about 3,000 steps and said I was in active range for 13 minutes.  OK.  Not bad. 

Today I was on the elliptical for 50 minutes.  The wear logged 2,000 steps and says I haven't been in an active range at all today. 

I know this stuff comes in time, but it's just making me anxious right now, since I just feel like I maybe made a mistake in buying this.  

Your help, answers, advice, etc, are all very welcome. 

Thanks!

	<TEXT> Hey everyone, 

I'm sure this has been asked before, but there are always new resources available, so I thought asking wouldn't hurt. 

I love interactive learning.  Reading is also incredibly helpful, but I need to apply what I read in a meaningful way, and while speaking and sentence writing are obviously keys, I'd love some kind of grammar game type deal like WankiKani and Memrise.  

I know there's a sentence building board game I can purchase, but is anyone aware of some sort of practical application of grammar lessons available online?  I don't care much about price, at this point, I just want to gather options. 

Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm sure this is a question that comes up frequently, but now that I have a few Japanese friends that I speak with often, it's becoming an issue that I can't quite figure out how to handle.  

The example: My friend Mayuka posted a picture of a dog.  I wanted to ask her if it was her dog, but then I realized I had a problem.  Do I write  or not?  And then the other problem is, if I just use her name instead, I don't know the Kanji for it, so do I write it in hiragana?  

Thank you, I realize this is a slightly specific question, but hopefully some help can be had, and learning for others as well.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Mothman Cometh </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-13 23:13:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I love horror stories and horror movies.  This is my favorite Subreddit, to boot.  I wouldn't say total immersion has stopped me from being startled or scared when I see or hear chilling stuff, but I will say that I don't exactly get scared by the boogeyman.  

Mostly.

There was one story that my friends told me, when we were young.  It was about the Mothman.  I don't know what story you heard, but chances are, it's a similar urban legend.  It goes a little something like this:  Somewhere in the world is a being who is almost human, appears almost human, except for one little detail.  His eyes bug out of his skull like a moth's and he craves the light in a similar way.  If you leave your blinds up at night, there's a chance that one day you'll look over, and there the Mothman will be, hands grasping at the glass, trying to get inside to the beautiful glow of the light inside.  

That was the story my friends told me, I know that the actual legend has the creature more, for lack of a better word, creature-like, but I think the realism to their story was what got me so badly.  From that point, until today, I don't even like to leave the blinds open during the day...just in case. 

Everything changed about a year ago, when my husband and I were getting in a tiff over why I didn't like him leaving the windows open at night.  Apparently in the three years we'd been married, and five years total we'd been together, I never mentioned my fear of the Mothman...but really, would you? What I realized that night was that I had actually forgotten why I was scared.  Over time, you just become used to the Status Quo, I suppose, and never question why you do things that may be a bit off of the norm.

Finally, I broke and explained that, crazy though it may be, I'm scared of this mythical figure.  It was a revelation to the both of us, as I hadn't thought of the Mothman in years.  To him, it was hilarious, because of my aforementioned love of horror and and all things scary.  He couldn't believe there was any urban legend out there that got to me to such a degree.  From that point on, whenever possible, he started to pick on my about the Mothman.  

Recently, we moved to California, which generally has been a fun experience, but our new apartment has a problem with one of the curtains, and it won't stay down.  So, some nights, I come home, only to walk into my bedroom and discover that the window shade is wide open.  I keep asking my husband to fix it, but he thinks it's funny.  Thought it was funny. 

Last night, I came home and walked into the bedroom and the window shade was up again.  I almost didn't even notice, I think I may have even been getting close to nipping that little fear of mine through exposure alone.

So, of course, that was the night the Mothman finally came.  

I glanced up from my paperwork, and there in the window were two bright red eyes starring back at me. I screamed and slammed the door closed.  And from there, it gets kinda sketchy in my memory.  I know that I went into the kitchen.  And I know I hid in the bathroom (no windows, of course).  And I called for my husband.

And I also know what you are all are thinking happened next.  I called, and he wasn't home.  He was stuck late at work.  So who was at the window? And thus our twist occurs. 

But that's not what happened. 

My husband was home. 

My husband was a funny guy. 

My husband just wanted to play a prank. 

Maybe I wasn't really getting over my fears after all.  

And I guess when I was in the kitchen I grabbed the butcher knife from the rack.  But at least now the Mothman's dead.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just moved out here about four months ago and I'm not really to up on the music scene yet.  I was just wondering if there was any venue that might be similar in style to the Empty Bottle in Chicago.  For those not familiar, but willing to offer advice, the Empty Bottle is a bar in Chicago with maybe a 400 person capacity that has live shows most nights of the week. The shows are well curated, usually various types of indie music, but not so obscure that you'd have to read your college roommate's cousin's zine to know who they are.  

It would be cool to find a similar venue out here, hopefully with similar ticket prices.  

Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I realize that I'm never going to fully understand  and.  As some have pointed out, if you didn't grow up with it, it's hard to understand.  That being said, I am trying to see if this explanation makes sense in the way I'm understanding it.

I use the book Japanese Demystified (because my bookstore had it and it seemed like a bit of fun).  In it, they explain that you use when the subject is also the topic of the sentence, but that you use  when there is a different topic.  Therefore, you would say:
If she is the topic of the conversation, but if you were talking about a party you were throwing and Yamada-san was also going to be attending, you would say: because she's not the exact subject, but the topic of the conversation?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there an accurate related translation for the word "flac"? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-21 21:12:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been using the dictionary word of the day for inspiration in vocabulary to learn. Yesterday I got the word "flac", as in, "he caught a lot of flac from his mother for going out to play without doing his chores." I could not find any translation for the word because Google was only recognizing the military definition of the word. Searching Google also proved futile. 

I'm hoping for as direct a translation as possible. It's obviously not imperative I learn the word, it's just the frustration of not finding the answer. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So what kind of dog IS she? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-05 00:53:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> About 18 months ago, I purchased (for a stupidly low price) a dog which I had been told was a Shetland Sheepdog.  I was told the price was low because the father didn't have papers.  I had seen the mom in a picture with the puppy, but the dad's picture was sent separately.  This was, supposedly, because the father lived with this woman's mother.  She seemed really honest, told me an entire story about how they had been planning to breed the two just to give it a try, but that it had been a great deal of work they had not expected, and in the end, there were only two puppies, the other, which, had died.  

So, I had my *adorable* little girl and she looked like what a Sheltie Puppie should...all was well, I thought.

We took her to the vet and immediately the vet recognized that she was going to be significantly undersized for a Shetland.  As she got older, though, she wasn't growing to look like a Sheltie, she just continued to look like a puppy.  I began to get extremely worried about her.  The vet didn't seem concerned, though, so I just let it go. 

After a year, it was pretty clear that I had been lied to.  I had found something on the internet suggesting that some Shetland Sheepdogs can develop a genetic issue that makes them look like the one I have, but I have never been able to find that article I read again.  Additionally, I began to look into mixes she possibly could be.  My husband insists she's mixed with a Chihuahua, but none of the pictures I see on Google look right, to me.  I spent a lot of time looking today, and I think she might be part Papillon.  She certainly seems to have the ears for it.

Anyways, I'm trying to decide if I should confront the woman about it.  I still have her contact info.  I'm just afraid of confronting her and finding out that really, there's just something weird with my dog and she was completely on the up and up.  There's not a lot to be gained by saying anything.  I love my dog to death, I just don't like being lied to.

So, what do you think, Internet?
