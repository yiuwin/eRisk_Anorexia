	<TITLE> Macbook pro 2012 vs Surface 3 pro </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-29 17:31:46 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Im a 2012 macbook pro owner. Its 2016 and I'm about to start school in graphics communication. I also use Ableton a lot as a musician. Without getting into a huge debate I'm not a huge fan of current choices made by apple and don't have a large budget. (can't afford to get an iPhone 6 yet). Im really interested in the surface and might just completely switch to Microsoft and android.  It looks like the surface pro 3  would cost me about the same that my macbook 2012 is worth.  Question is, is it worth it? The functions of the surface just seems attractive for creative development. Should i make the switch? What other PC options are there that would make a good Mac to PC switch? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Associates to BS? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So im a little over half way down with a Humanities AA degree. the only reason I was doing it was I didnt know what i wanted and it seemed easier then other degrees. took a break from college and now I am considering going back for Computer Science. My community college offers "computer and information science" and "computer engineering" AA degrees but not BS. should I switch to to one of these and finish it since I already have some credits that will go towards it. Then i could switch over to another school to get my BS in CS. 
(btw if this is in the wrong subreddit let me know) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> CS job a good choice for musician? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I just graduated from a year program for music and I'm thinking about going back to school. I've read a lot about musicians making great software developers and I think that I could enjoy it. knowing that the music industry is a very tough field, I'd rather not suffer in it with a minimum wage job. So I want a day job that Interest me and that pays the bills so I can support myself. I have a few question, does this job consume your time after work hours?(like do you constantly have to keep up with tech in order to keep jobs), also how rare are part time jobs for any CS job? so basically is this a good job choice for someone who wants to pursue music after hours and could it turn into a part time job if want to do more with music? </TEXT>
