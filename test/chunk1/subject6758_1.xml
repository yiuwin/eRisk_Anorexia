	<TEXT> So I was playing as the count of Lubeck (I held 4 other countries) and I decided to declare war on an independent county next to me. This was in 820 and we where both pagans. Now, the game said that he had 300 soldiers. I had 2000. The county had no tribal vassals and the ruler had only 50 prestige. I declare war and the county magically gets 3K levies and wipes me out, forcing me to surrender. Is there an explanation to this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You have convinced me and I wholeheartedly agree that the English language should be changed to better adapt to our internet culture. However, I still feel that standardizing the spelling of English would a be a means to normalize the language to students and adults all over the globe. Now, I definitely see that all British people understand that color is colour and that all Americans see that colour is color. I still feel that there are a few exceptions for example, chips and crisps, french fries and chips and plow and plough (with the latter appearing to be pronounced as pl-o-ff). However, your argument has made me realize that these examples are to few and not dissimilar enough to warrant an overhaul in the way we teach English.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> CMV: We should start teaching British spelling and grammar as the default way write and type in the English language. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The English language is being taught in schools all over the globe in English and non English speaking countries. However, from my experiences in being taught English in school, it can become confusing and frankly frustrating when you read different spellings for the same words, (colour and color and plow and plough to name a few).

I can imagine that someone who isn't fluent in the English language can easily be mistaken that these words mean completely different things, or when someone has seen the word colour, but hasn't seen the word plough. This would most likely cause the person to write sentences like "The colour of the plow was red". And in my opinion, consistency is the most important part when writing English.

So why do I believe that British spelling should be the norm? 

British spelling is the most widely adopted form of English grammar. Many people see it as "oh the Brits say lef-tenn-ant-", while it's really a case of, "The English speaking world except for the US says lef-tenn-ant". Since British grammar is the most adopted and officially recognized in words such as aluminium vs aluminum and pronunciations such as bai-san-taines vs byh-zan-teens. Most historians see them as the bai-san-taines and most scientists see aluminium cans.

So why should I care? 

Well, for the confusing factor as mentioned above and due to the fact that Google will auto correct or redline British spelling.

To summarize, we should start teaching British spelling in schools and make it into the grammatical norm of the English language. That way, we can avoid confusion and inconsistencies when we write and type. I'm NOT however, arguing for British pronunciation. That should be entirely up to the individual. </TEXT>
