	<TEXT> I think that I would like to go to Gonzaga for Law School,but If I end up liking Missoula,I would totally consider law school there too. 
What's Dorm life like in Missoula? I was in North Hedges in Bozeman,and I had a ton of fun. I like to party for sure,but I'm also very studious.
Thanks for answering my questions! I really am having a tough time deciding between UofM or MSU. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently ended 2 year long,borderline abusive relationship. My ex was incredibly demeaning,controlling,mean,insensitive and jealous. He had me convinced that I could never find anyone better than him,but now that I'm single again,I KNOW that I deserve better. It feels amazing. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm a Political Science major. MSU or UofM? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm currently a Freshman,and I attended my first semester of college at MSU. I don't particularly like the town of Bozeman,I found it to be too small,AWFUL traffic, and the school itself seems to be mainly focused on engineering and science related majors.

I don't know Missoula very well,I've only grown up in Billings. Do you think that MSU or UofM is a better school for Political Science majors? I plan on law school after Undergrad,so the importance of the school may not be all that relevant anyways.
Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My 19(M) Boyfriend of two years snooped onto my Reddit account,and then broke up with me(18,F) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Alright,so my boyfriend and I were together for about two years. Things have been rocky since the summer,but we've stuck it out. He's always been the more emotional one,he's always been incredibly insecure,and he has NEVER trusted me,for whatever reason.

So a few hours ago,he calls me and lets me know that he had figured out my old reddit account,read all of my previous posts,comments,questions,and decided that we needed to break up. I agree that it's time to end things,but I am fucking livid with him. I'm not remotely sad,but I'm just angry that he snooped. I know that Reddit is a public forum,but I feel like it's private,in a sense like a diary or something. I don't remember any of the posts that "incriminated" me,and I promptly deleted that account,because I feel so dumb. I have never cheated, and I've always done my best to be a good girlfriend. 

I'm happy that i'm single now,but I'm just so humiliated that he read through my WHOLE reddit history. Am I in the wrong for being pissed?

TL:DR; My boyfriend snooped into my reddit history,and then broke up with me </TEXT>
