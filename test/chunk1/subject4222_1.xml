	<TEXT> Our justice system folks. Thank bleeding heart liberals for the fact this kind shit happens. Instead a quick execution after a guilty verdict these monsters get to live on while the victims are dead and the family had to go on living with the fact that the killer is alive and well, and that their taxes help keep that person alive as well. Murders give up their right to live when they take a life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me and buddy from school were out one night sitting on a tree that overlooked a ravine smoking. We were teens and had snuck out of my parents house.  It was December so must of the leaves are gone off the trees. We could clearly see the road that was about thirty yards from the ravine, and we could see a good bit down the road. 

Not long after we got there a car pulled up to the side of the road and a man got out. He opened the trunk and pulled a long big black bag of of it and set it down right on the edge of the road then drove off. We didn't think much of it, probably just some trash. About ten mins later a truck pulls up and a man gets out, and he puts the bag into the truck and drives off.  Wish we would have gone and looked at what was in the bag.  </TEXT>

Cigs I did cold turkey but not in my own a cord. I was broke and couldn't buy my two pack a day smokes. So I just said fuck it and went through hell for three days. I literally got sick, saw shit and went a little nuts on that last day. After that the cravings were gone and after two weeks I never got the urge again to smoke. Quitting pot was way easier. I just sat it down and went on with my life. I will never stop gaming. I might be borderline addicted to it but I played games since I was six. I will never stop.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuck them. Why do you need to make sure that your students are comfortable with teaching them their history? Who cares if they get upset or feel any kind of way about it? This pandering to a groups feelings cause of their race and the subject matter is actually hurting them. History is raw. If the blacks in your class are uncomfortable with the whites and the whites are uncomfortable with the blacks all because of the subject matter then good. It's ok for them to be.  That point in time was crucial for our nation and the abolishment of slavery. Neither side of the race card should be ashamed of the color of their skin and should learn to not care about what any other person thinks about them. If they are uncomfortable then that may shows they need some more growing up to do. But don't pander to it and tip toe around any of them. Don't even acknowledge that they have this issue. One of the craziest things about race is.... If you act like race doesn't matter then it stops mattering to you.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I want to tell you about what happened the other night but first I believe you need some back story to understand what I feel like it means.

I was raised in a Christian home and went to a Christian school. In my Junior year in High School I stared to experiment with different recreational drugs (as most teens did). Me and my friends really like to smoke weed. We use to wake up in the morning and head to one of our friends house and light up before heading out to school every day. One night two of my buddies were riding around and called me to see if I wanted to smoke? I told them I couldn't leave cause I was grounded for  that very thing. Of course they talked me into it and I sneak out of the house to meet them in the woods. My parents owned 27 acres of woods and it sat against other wooded properties which made it a great place to hide out in. I met up with my friends on the dirt road leading to our pond. I road the 4-wheeler to the spot and parked right up on the car. So about 30 minuets pass and we are high as hell. My buddy had his car door open and his cab light was on. He drove this little grey car that had no real back seat but it did have back side windows. We were laughing and having a good time when I happen to look over and through the back side window and I saw it. There was two red eyes looking into the car at my friend in the passenger seat. For a moment I was in denial of what I saw and was chalking up to the really good high I was having, but then something happen that made me think it was really there. The thing in the window turned and looked directly at me. It had a human face to it and was blacker than the night itself. Suddenly headlights broke through the trees and the thing turned it's head to look at the lights then ran around the car ,toward my side, and off into the woods. The headlight was my father driving down to find me. He must have heard the 4-wheeler when I left. Needless to say I was in even deeper trouble. 

Now this wasn't a single event with the red eyes. Nor was this a single occurrence of some strange shit happening in these woods. There had been many a sighting of the red eyed creatures in these woods and not just by me and my friends. There was  something that started to become clear with every sighting. Every time one was seen there always was some kind of mishap or strange occurrence happen right after the sighting. Friends would loose something they just had with them or things would break for no reason and even on person got into a car wreck moments after seeing one. And before you ask, NO. People were not high every time these things happened. 

This kind of thing went on for years. It wasn't always the eyes that scared us though. One time me and my buddy Mark went for a walk in the woods to smoke. We went pretty far out. We ended up on another piece of property that was partitioned off from my parents property by Power Polls that clear cut right through the woods to the highway. We got right passed those lines and decided to light up. Right as we did we heard the loudest step I have heard in my life. It sounded like something huge was stomping around in the woods. Me and Mark didn't even light the damn joint and decided to book it. We ran back into the woods heading to my house. This thing was right behind us every step of the way. It got louder and louder as if it was right on our heels. Then something made us stop in our tracks. The sound came from in front of us. We were on a hill overlooking the lake and I could barely see the house that sat on another hill that overlooked the lake as well. We couldn't see what was stomping around in front of us. The sun light was barely breaking through the tree tops and it made strange shapes on the ground. Stomp Stomp Stomp. The thing was getting closer. We ran again, this time heading parallel to the lake and house. The entire time the stomping kept pace and seemed to enjoy fucking with us. Finally we said to hell with it and ran directly to the house. We never saw what it was that made that loud stomping sounds. There had been times when I would sit out on the porch and could hear those stomping sounds out in the woods just beyond the shadows. To this day I still have not figured them out.

Fast forward to present day. I am much older now and long been moved out of that house but not far away. I live in a trailer park not more than a few minuets from my parents house. Just a few days ago we had a bad storm system move into the area and brought some damaging winds and a few tornadoes. It was about 12:30 a.m. when the alerts started coming in over the phone. We awoke to the first one warning us of a possible tornado in the area. Well I don't play with those, especially living in a trailer. We throw on some clothes and head out the door to go to my parents house cause they have better shelter there. When we get out the door I see something I haven't seen in years. There was the dark figure with red eyes looking into the window of my neighbors trailer. One of the crazy things is, is the window it was looking in was seven feet off the ground. It looked so natural though. As if it was supposed to be that tall and all. It turned and looked me directly in my eyes and I swear it smiled at me before it ran behind their trailer. Me and my fiancee went to my parents house to ride out the storm. About and hour later we left my parents house to go back home. All the power was out in the park and surrounding area. When I pulled up to the trailer I instantly noticed something was wrong. There was two big ass trees that sat between me and my neighbors homes. The one that sat closest to my neighbors back window had fallen over onto their shed and trailer. It crushed their shed and did some real damage to the trailer. It also caught some power lines that helped it slow down as it fell. I rushed over to help my neighbor and she was all right, shaken but ok. The fire fighters and cops came and so did the power company that night. They told my neighbor she was lucky the power lines and shed was there, because they kept the tree from crashing in on her bedroom and crushing her while she slept. 

I haven't done any drugs in years. I gave that up a long time ago, but to see the red eyed figure again.... I wonder if they are bringers of misfortune? Maybe the harbingers of bad luck. Who knows? I do know this though. What I thought was just weed and drugged induced hallucinations may not be that case. I and a  few others may be able to see a little beyond veil of this world. Or not.  </TEXT>
