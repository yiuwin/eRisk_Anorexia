	<TEXT> I have an interview for the York Region District School Board next week and I am extremely nervous. I have over 10 years experience in the child care area but interviews make me freeze up and I end up not feeling as confident. 
I know there is a 15 minute written practicum and then a 40 minute interview. 

TEACHERS or anyone with experience in this interview can you please give me advice??????!?!!?!


What is the most embarrassing thing you have done in an interview?

	<TEXT> Wanna hear something even more creepier.. 
This is words right out of Robert Munsch's mouth...

Love You Forever started as a song.

Ill love you forever,
Ill like you for always,
as long as Im living
my baby youll be.

I made that up after my wife and I had two babies born dead. The song was my song to my dead babies. For a long time I had it in my head and I couldnt even sing it because every time I tried to sing it I cried. It was very strange having a song in my head that I couldnt sing.

For a long time it was just a song but one day, while telling stories at a big theatre at the University of Guelph, it occurred to me that I might be able to make a story around the song.

Out popped Love You Forever, pretty much the way it is in the book.

My regular publisher felt that it was not really a kids book and I ended up doing it with another publisher.

One day the publisher called up and said This is very strange. It is selling very well in retirement communities in Arizona. It is selling in retirement communities where kids are illegal. This is supposed to be a childrens book. What is going on?

Grownups are buying it for grownups!

In fact, it turned out that parents buy it for grandparents and grandparents buy it for parents and kids buy it for everybody and everybody buys it for kids.

As a matter of fact, everybody buys it for everybody. Thats why it sells a lot of copies. I think its my best book. So far it has sold about 15,000,000 copies.

Everybody makes up their own song for this book. I would like to put different versions of the song up on this site, now that the site has sound on it. If you send me your version, either as a tape or an audio file or a MR3 file, I will try to put it up in the LOVE YOU page. If lots of people send me their versions, I will not be able to put them all up, but I would like to hear them even if I cant put them on the site.

The way I sing it in the story is just MY version. You are supposed to make up your own.

	<TEXT> I have been making cakes for a while now and I am still confused about how to properly cover a cake with fondant... I cannot find the answer to my question and was wondering if anyone could please help me. 

So once I have covered the cake with fondant it looks good. Then an hour later I look at it again and it is either taring or there is a huge bubble in the side of the cake. How do I prevent this from happening? What am I doing wrong?
How much icing should I put under the layer of fondant?
How thick should the fondant be???
Is it the type of fondant I am using? (Satin Ice)
Is it the colour I am adding to the fondant??

I think they way you eat something changes its taste. 
For example ... cutting a grilled cheese sandwich taste better cutting the bread sideways into triangles rather then right down the middle making two rectangles.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are two things I would tell myself. 

1. Live a little and do some crazy things that don't matter as much as when your a kid then when you're an adult and have responsibilities. 

2. Figure out a profession I would enjoy in life but also make more money in. Yes I know money isn't everything.... but these days to live and play a little you need extra money on the side. The biggest thing I want in life is to have a big family and truly I have no idea how people afford kids these days AND A PET! I NEED A DOG IN MY LIFE!
I love my job but there are so many other ways I could have gone with my life.... it's kinda crazy how small choices can change your whole path.

Trust me it will hurt for a while... for at lest 3-5 years later we could still hear her nails of her foot steps running across the hardwood floors 
Every time we came home we expected her to be greeting us in the front hallway...   its 11 years later and I still miss her like no tomorrow!!!  </TEXT>
