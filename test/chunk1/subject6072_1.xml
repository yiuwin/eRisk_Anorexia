	<TEXT> Well, kind of.

The high-priced contracts are one issue, but actually not the biggest.  The biggest is that Ontario has a huge over-supply of electricity.  When producers sign contracts, the utility guarantees they will purchase their electricity at a set rate.  When Ontario has more electricity than they have demand, they ship it to the States on an excess contract for wholesale rates (AKA, at a significant loss to what they paid for it).  Last year, they shipped about 1.7 Billion of electricity south for big losses.  

So Ontario can't buy Quebec's electricity for less because they already have too much supply they are locked into taking (but that would have been the smart way to do it).

Really, the whole situation is such a clusterfuck you wonder how on Earth they managed to screw things up this bad without trying.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't make the mistake of thinking Shell in 1970 = Shell in 2017.  This guy can only be held responsible for the company under his leadership, not the actions of Shell 30 years ago.  And the solution is not to say "Fuck them no matter what" imo.  It's to applaud them for things like this, and critisize them for the opposite.  This is going to be a lot easier if Shell is working with us, not against us.

But also, don't blame oil companies for causing climate change.  If it wasn't Shell, it would be BP or some other company.  They're just filling a market demand.  The problem *is* the demand, not those that provide for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly?

If even the oil companies are saying "Yeah thats a good idea", then I think that means something.  Where I live, when the Premier announced a carbon tax a few big oil CEO's publicly supported it and her, even stood beside her at the announcement.

Yeah, of course they aren't lobbying for it.  If they spent all their money lobbying for taxes that hurt them, well thats a terrible business plan and we could never expect them to do that.  But I don't think that makes their words meaningless. </TEXT>

First, they are investing 1 Billion a year into renewables, so they are doing something.

But theyre still an oil company.  You can't expect them to lead the fight against oil.  And I don't think its meaningless that even they are getting on board with this. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-28 20:41:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sorry, lot of venting here.

So I just had a huge legal midterm.  Last night, as I was frantically cramming my girlfriend flipped out at me.  She's been getting mad at me a lot lately (which has been incredibly frustrating on its own, but thats a whole different issue) but this one got me.

She started texting me, seemingly got very happy (although I didn't realize how upset she was).  I tried to reply as best I could, but like I said, I was frantically cramming for this exam.  

Then, she called me.  I answered, and we talked for about 20 minutes before she hung up on me (conversation was about about how she felt I didn't care and I didn't love her).

I texted her a lot after, but basically I ended it a little afer 12:30 with a text saying "I love you, and I will come see you right after this exam tomorrow, but I need to goto sleep right because this exam starts at 8 AM."

The thing is, this is the THIRD time she's done this.  She seems to think I should just throw my school aside and focus on her.  She said if i was upset she would spend all night helping me even if she had a diploma the next morning.

The thing is, she doesn't have a diploma...she isn't even in school right now.  And I wouldn't do that to her.  It's really fucking easy to say you would when you don't actually have to deal with it.

Mostly, instead of fixing what she was upset about, I'm just pissed right now.  Im pissed she put me in this situation AGAIN.  

Do I have a right to be mad?  I honestly dont even know.  

Any advice is REALLY appreciated.  

TL:DR My girlfriend got really upset with me late the night before a huge test (again), I'm pissed about it and I think this isnt fair to me. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-27 02:03:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I couldn't find a better way to word that, but I think it gets the point across.

We've been arguing a lot lately.  Like every few days.  The thing is, it's always her mad (literally almost never me).

I try to listen to her, see what she's angry about, and then put some effort into fixing whatever the problem is.  I feel like I've made a lot of changes to try and improve things.  But I seem to get no where.  Every 3 days (give or take a couple days) there's another argument, seemingly no matter what.  I've even had big talks to try and figure out if there is a "root cause", but it got me nowhere.

I can't do things like this anymore.  Aside from the emotional burden (which sucks obviously) of arguing all the time, this is wreaking havoc on my schedule.  

I'm in university and I have a really heavy courseload I sometimes struggle to keep up with.  I'm also trying to start my own business on the side (something that is very important to me).  Between this, my time not spent with her is packed (and I still manage to see her a fair amount).  But it really kills me when all of a sudden my homework/studying/business is interrupted and I spend hours talking to her, on the phone with her, going to see her.  If this was every now and then, I wouldnt mind, shit happens, relationships are work and you make time.  But I can't spontaneously make time this often anymore.

I love my girlfriend, and I want things to work.  But she seems perenially unhappy and I don't know what to do (the thing is, when we're together she's 100% happy, it's always when we aren't).  But if things are always going to be like this, I can't do it anymore.

TL;DR: How do I more sensitively say that I can't argue this much and be okay with it?  Any and all advice is appreciated =D </TEXT>

Non-Trump supporter.  Actually, I'll be pretty upfront here; I don't like Trump.  I should also mention I'm actually Canadian, so I didn't vote this election regardless.  But I want to hear your perspective to better understand.  So here are my questions:

	<TEXT> Watching 12 Years A Slave, I started wondering.  Was it a common thing?  Or was it more considered a long shot?  Did many slaves know of it?  What were the odds that a slave would be rescued in the Underground Railway?  

Also, how did slaves typically get into contact with the Underground Railway?

As far as plantation owners go, were they much concerned with it?  Would they be aware with its existence?

Furthermore, was the Underground Railway a structured organization or was it really just a loose term of people that assisted escaped slaves?  Did it have significant backing from any major sources (governments, corporations, wealthy individuals)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys!

So I have my own portfolio of stocks.  Currently, it consists of 13 dividend paying stocks (12 stocks, 1 mutual fund actually).  I'm currently in school, so I don't add any money.   However, I'll leave soon and be able to start buying up more shares soon.  

I've heard 20-25 in the past.  Is this a good number?  Obviously I want to be well-diversified, but if I pick too many, I won't be able to keep up with them enough.  Just to be clear, this is a long-term portfolio.  I plan on holding these stocks for as long as possible while collecting dividends.

So how many is too many? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm debating an uncle here who doesn't much believe in renewables.  He said the green industry can't benefit the economy because it's just replacing the current fossil fuel industry (i.e. it's not "adding" anything).  His argument is also since the energy is being consumed internally, it can't benefit the economy because it isn't producing anything.  He says if the green industry creates additional jobs, it would be mean the energy costs more (and so it isn't reallly helping the economy).

How true is this?  Is there a reasonable counter-argument to this?  How can green energy help an economy? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anthony Bennett Advanced Look </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-07 02:42:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys!  I've just put together some interesting stuff about AB.

First, his plain stats line up like this:

11.5 MPG/41.3 FG%/27.1 3PT%/72.2 FT%/3.4 RPG/0.5 APG/0.5 TOV/5.0 PPG

Not so great obviously.  He doesn't stand out anywhere.  But, when you look at his per-36 numbers, they look like this:

10.6 RPG/3.4 ORB/1.6 APG/1.6 TOV/2.5 PF/15.7 PPG

Those are decent per-36 numbers.  Turnovers and fouls are reasonable, rebounding and points are respectable (nothing spectacular by any means, but decent).  That gives the impression that Bennett is reasonably productive in his time on the floor.  

Of course that doesn't include his efficiency numbers, which are horrible.  Bennett has not shown the ability to be efficient from the field.  But let's break his field goal attempts down a little:

Bennett averages 4 field goal attempts.  Of those 4, 2.1 are 3-Point attempts.  Just 1.9 are 2-Point attempts.  Per-36, this works out to 6.5 3 point attempts.  That's an absurd number for someone shooting 27.1% from 3 this season, and 26.1% in his career.

On two-pointers, Bennett has actually been pretty efficient.  He is shooting 56.8%, by far his career best (closest is 43% in Minnesota).  

So Bennett might actually have some efficiency promise, but he would have to drastically cut down on his 3 attempts, and take more 2's.

Even then, Bennett might not look like an NBA player.  But there is hope.  It's pretty clear he's taking a ridiculous number of 3's given his percentages.  Maybe, if you could get that under control, Bennett might look a little better.   </TEXT>

Were the successful landings at D-Day the best candidate?  How different would have the war been if they had failed?  Did it come at some point in between when they were advancing across France?  Or was it a different event entirely? 

Or perhaps I'm thinking too specifically and it was a broader timeframe?   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-07-22 10:33:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys!
I'm glad to join the community. The one thing I've noticed as an acupuncture enthusiast is the quality of the practitioner closely relates to the quality of the acupuncture itself. If the practitioner doesn't know what they're doing, you won't see the results you should. Acupoints have to be hit with accuracy. That's the reason I started http://findacupuncture.ca, to try and create a high quality resource for finding acupuncture.
With that being said, I have a few basic tips to try and make sure you get the right practitioner:
Get Reccomendations. Do you know someone that has recieved acupuncture care? See who they went to. If they got good results, there is a good chance you will to.
Ask their specialty. This is one people very commonly overlook. Often, you didn't go to the wrong acupuncturist, you just went to an acupuncturist that specialized in another field. Acupuncture treats such a huge variety of conditions that you have to be aware of which niche you fit in.
Look online to see other people's opinions. Reviews and forums are always good resources to check on reputations. If they look solid online, chances are they are solid.
See how long they've been practicing in the area for. Acupuncturists rely largely on word of mouth business. If they have been in the area for longer, there is a better chance they are reputable.
Hope that helps! Id love to hear your guys comments below! </TEXT>

I found a fantastic 08 coupe with 74,000 kms on it (46,000 miles).  It was clearly very well taken care of.  The only thing that makes me nervous is the 335i (addition of twin turbos).  All thoughts experience and input is very welcome and helpful! </TEXT>

Is there some defiency that makes rust an issue?  My worry is that even if I find one rust-free, will this be something I worry about in the future?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So Ill just provide the basic details:

-I live in Alberta, Canada
-I was at fault in the car crash
-My insurance policy covers 1M in lawsuits

It was a relatively minor crash.  I hit the side of the other car while turning left.

It was surprising because there were very minor injuries on site.  The other driver complained of shoulder pain, and thought it was broke.  The EMTs looked her over quickly and said it wasnt broken, only bruised from the seat belt.  They offered to take her to the hospital (but told her they didn't believe it was neccesary).  She declined.  

Then, today (about 3 weeks later) I get a call from my insurance company telling me she's retained a lawyer.  Thats about all I know as of now.  

So what are my options here?  Whats my best course of action?  Im really lost and surprised here, I did not expect a lawsuit from this at all and Ive never been in a similar situation before.

	<TITLE> Buying 2009 BMW - Price and Negotiation Advice </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-07 09:04:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I live in Alberta, Canada for starters.  And I lied a little, I'm not set on buying this car at all yet.  In fact I'm still looking at a lot of other cars.  I will be buying outright with no trade in.  Its at a Nissan dealership.

So the car in question is a 2009 BMW 328XI with 130k kms (no navigation or comfort access).  The list price is $15,900 (with 5% GST tax on top of whatever it sells for).  It was originally listed for 1k more but they dropped the price (its been for sale for 24 days on AutoTrader).  

There were a few things I disliked about the car despite its overall good condition:

-It was below the minimum level for oil
-There was almost no gas in it (range: 10km)
-There was a tear on the leather in th drivers seat
-Some small plastic meshing in the front bumper was broke...not a big deal
-The radio display wasn't right(knowing BMW, potentially a pricey fix)

The salesman knew we were looking at a similar car later that day for just 11k in a private deal.  He mumbled out that he might be able to get to "mid 14's" or "low 14's" or "14.9".  This was without us even asking, the salesman seemed to know they were way out of line with the other car I was looking at. The car is in line with other similar dealership cars listed (many private cars are listed for a lot less) but I know they are selling for less.  My brother bought an 09 (with more options) and 80k kms for 13k a few months ago.  I do like the color of the car and the look better (has nice rims as well)...hence why Im looking at it over cheaper cars.  

Right now my strategy would be to hit him with a number that I am willing to pay and stick to it (all fees and everything exept for GST have to fit in this).  If anyone has a better strategy Im all ears.  My question is, how much can I expect to shave off the price?  How should I get them there?  I really have no idea on whats reasonable to expect a dealership to drop in price.  How do I really get the best deal in a car like this?   Should I compare it to other cars?  Or point out its damage?  

Any advice is appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Using social authority with PBNs? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ive heard a lot about PBNs losing their effectiveness in the past 2 years.  However, they still can be very effective.  Ive heard one way to increase their effectiveness is to combine them with social authority.  Whats your guys experiences with this?  

Does hitting them with social authority mean the link being shared on social networks, or the social accounts connected to the PBN getting followers/likes/shares/etc,.  Has it helped?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ive been looking at snagging an established domain but it appears that isnt possible right now.  Second option is to start with a fresh domain, whats the first step in building some DA after getting a new domain so that I can compete with those already ranking?

It doesnt have to be crazy high at all, competitors have like 15 max.  Just a boost to be competitive. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My girkfriend (18F) thinks Im hiding something because I dont like her looking through my (19M) phone </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My girlfriend of one year and I got in an arguement today, she believes Im hiding something because I dont like her looking through my phone.  Actually, I just dont like anyone touching my phone at all.  Ive always been private with my phone, I dont
 even like giving it to friends to to use for calls.  

Im not hiding anything from my girlfriend, I have never even thought of cheating on her so I cant even pinpoint a real reason I dont like it, I just dont.  Its not like shes never on it, her fingerprint is in my phone so she can get in it anytime.  If Im driving and I get a text, Ill ask her to reply for me and she goes on it all the time for music and to look at pictures and stuff.  And Im pretty sure shes seen everything on it at some point or another.  None of that bothers me at all.  Its when she does stuff like today, she grabs it and just starts randomly searching through it.  She goes through everything,  my snapchat, my reddit, all my texts, all my internet tabs....just everything.  She even turns so I cant see what shes looking at.  She can see me get uncomfortable, even nervous looking which makes her feel like Im hiding something (I dont know what though).  In reality, Im just a private person and it bugs me.  

I feel like Im just expecting a reasonable level of privacy, maybe I'm wrong though...I want to talk to her about this before it becomes an even bigger deal but I dont evwn know what to say.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have never written a book before in my life.  However, I originally read about people earning a little bit of money every month from writing a book with decent enough content (AKA speak coherent English).  
 nbsp;

I underwent a fairly big transformation over the course of a few years from basically no confident to where I am today; so naively confident I go around publishing books with no experience.  
 nbsp;

Ask me anything about the book, my life, my dogs, or absolutely anything else!!  

Edit:  Shit, also [here's the book link](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Confidence-Self-Confidence-Transform-Themselves-ebook/dp/B01498ZESQ/ref=sr_1_8?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1440884298 sr=1-8 keywords=building+confidence).   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [ADVICE] My Take on Building Confidence </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-30 01:01:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So full disclosure, I have wrote a book on building confidence (which is actually how I came to find /r/Confidence).  I'll shamelessly drop the link [here](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Confidence-Self-Confidence-Transform-Themselves-ebook/dp/B01498ZESQ/ref=sr_1_8?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1440884298 sr=1-8 keywords=building+confidence)

 nbsp;

But onto the important stuff.  When you're trying to build confidence, people try to do the right thing and get advice.  Sadly, too much of this advice boils down to "love yourself" or "just believe in yourself".  Sure that's PART of the problem.  But I think for many people it's really not that simple (it sure as hell wasn't for me).  I like to take a lot more "scientific" approach to confidence.  You have to figure out what kind of things are preventing you from being confident, and you have to stop doing those things.  When you're insecure, you naturally think in insecure ways.  That's why becoming confident is something that isn't easy to do, *you have to literally change the ways that you think and the way you see things.*  
 nbsp;

To a point, confidence is also a choice.  People will ask me how to become confident, but there still saying things like "I can't get with that girl...".  If you're still saying that stuff, you haven't made a choice to be confident yet.  
 nbsp;

The three absolutely vital pieces of advice I have that I think building confidence boils down to:

 nbsp;

**1.  Realize You Have Value.**  Every person has value, we just often don't realize we do.  Value can be in the form of physical appearance, but it's not restricted to it.  Value can be in humor, value can be in a truly good listener (which isn't nearly as common as you think),  or it can be in any other personality trait.  
 nbsp;

When I was 16, I started working as a shop hand in a local heavy equipment shop.  I became friends with one of the wash bay guys, lets call him Spencer, because that was actually his name.  Over my time there, I very much came to look up to Spencer.  16 year old me was awkward, and insecure; Spencer was everything I admired.  He was talkative, funny, good with women, and extremely confident.  I'll never forget what he said to me one day.
 nbsp;

We're standing in his wash bay talking and cleaning up, and he says to me "Why the fuck would a girl ever get with you?".  I was dumbfounded, I had absolutely no idea how to answer that.  
 nbsp;

"So?" and he looked at me.  
 nbsp;

"Well..." I said, still drawing a blank "I'm pretty nice I think..."
 nbsp;


"Lotta fucking nice guys out there.  Try again"
 nbsp;

I didn't know what to say.  I had never thought about it that far.
 nbsp;

"Well let me ask you a question then.  If you can't even answer that question, how are they supposed to?"
 nbsp;

The two minute conversation stuck with me to this day.  You need to be able to answer that question.  Why would a girl get with you?  I guarantee there are reasons, you just need to figure out what they are.
 nbsp;

**2.  Fake It Till You Make It**

 nbsp;

You don't wait until you reach a point where you think you are confident to start acting like it.  You start acting like it now.  You say what you honestly think.  Walk like you're confident.  If you have to Google how to walk confidently, *then you fucking Google how to walk confidently*.
 nbsp;

When you say something, you say it like you mean it.  Make eye contact.  Hold eye contact.  Tell someone to fuck off if you need to.  

Stand up straight for gods sake.  If you ignore everything else I ever say, stand up straight.  Straighten your spine, broaden your shoulders.  Put your hands at your sides, don't hold them in front of you.  
 nbsp;

Even if you aren't quite there yet, you can convince 95% of others that you are.  Just by acting like you're confident, it will help you *become* more confident.  

 nbsp;

**3.  Be Authentic in Your Personality**

 nbsp;

Don't pretend to be someone your not.  Be who you naturally are.  That doesn't mean that who you are is an insecure loser who should just hole up in your basement forever.  If you aren't funny, then don't try to be funny.  If you aren't naturally a super-talkative person, you don't have to be.  I've known plenty of people who were quiet, and still extremely confident.  
 nbsp;

Being authentic means you speak your mind.  You don't hide your opinions to agree with those around you.  You aren't afraid to be in the minority.  You won't compromise your values.  You aren't afraid to make enemies.  
 nbsp;

You are self-aware.  You know when you were in the wrong, and you can admit to those mistakes and even apologize when it needs it.  If you do apologize, you say it honestly and with purpose.  You *mean* it.  When you say anything, you mean it.  
 nbsp;
 nbsp;

 nbsp;

I hope my take on things can help some people.  If anyone has anything to add or another perspective, then feel free to add onto this!  Of course my own advice is mainly based on my own journey to self-confidence.  Everyone else has a different journey, and so they will have a little bit different advice, so it's always good to hear other perspectives.
