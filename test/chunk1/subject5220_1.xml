	<TEXT> Back when I was 5 or 6, me and my siblings had sleep suits. These were fleecy all-in-one pyjamas, with zip up front. Lovely and snuggly for the cold months (We didn't have central heating till a few years later).

One night, my parents were entertaining some friends so I'd tried to get dressed for bed by myself without calling for my mum. Getting into the sleepsuit was no problem, but zipping it up obviously required more dexterity than I had. I enthusiastically yanked the zip up, stopping when it zipped straight up and gripped my penis with tiny, zippy teeth. 

It was more shock at first, but then I realised how much it hurt. Stumbling downstairs, I walked into the living room where my parents were chatting with their friends, pointed at my, now probably quite red, trapped penis, and tearfully asked for help.  </TEXT>

I'm having an alcohol free month, and am one week in, but before that I was enjoying some of my new Ardbeg Alligator, which is gorgeous. Also some Smokehead, which I felt not so much disappointed with, but after reading it had Lagavulin influences (My favourite tipple by far), wasn't as impressed as I was hoping for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ravenous, with Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle. Oh and David Arquette. Music by Damon Albarn of Blur too. Great film, not so much underrated as just not shown much. I guess it went straight to dvd on release. Also The Host, a Korean monster movie - great non hollywood action film.

Others:
-the Korean vengeance trilogy (Sympathy for Lady Vengeance etc)
-Immortel, a French sci-fi, comic book adaptation about Egyptian gods
-Bubba Hotep, starring Bruce Campbell as Elvis Presley, again with an egyptian theme </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a crowed pub I asked my friend "What do you do if an epileptic has a fit in their bath?", following it up with the hugely, witty "You chuck your washing in". 

A bloke from the adjacent table turned to me at that point and said that his son had died after having an epileptic fit in the bath. Shit, I thought, this'll teach me for telling offensive jokes. I apologised to him, saying I meant no offense. Chagrined, I asked him how his son died, did he hit his head on one of the taps perhaps?. "Nah", the bloke replied, "he choked on one of my socks" </TEXT>
