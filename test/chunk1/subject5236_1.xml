	<TEXT> Harambe rap.

May 28th, 2016, they killed a real G in Cincinnati. I pour this 40 to the floor for my nigga gone before me. Only 17 years old and they gunned you down. Named for Harambe by Rita Marley, I wear my dick out because your death was too gnarley. I miss you Homie, I really do. And when I get to heaven I'm going to find you. It's all that boy's fault, not yours I promise. That boy caused your death and that is why I write this. They shot you brotha, and that's why it's you who I miss. Soon we will be together. Just rest, sweet prince. </TEXT>
