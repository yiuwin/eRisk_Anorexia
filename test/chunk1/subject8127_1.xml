	<TEXT> Like many parents, my wife and I are deeply shocked by the news that a 15-year-old Tennessee girl disappeared with her 50-year-old teacher. Although the girl was rescued after more than a month, the ordeal she suffered may be hard to get rid of. The girl's parents also get harmed by the incidence. The girls father said his daughter had sent romantic mails to her then-married teacher. But the girls parents didnt realize the seriousness of their daughter's relationship with the predator and also didn't take timely action to prevent things from getting worse. As a father of 14 year old girl, I hope that such a thing will never happen to my own daughter. But what can I do to prevent predators from hurting my children?

My daughter is active in Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram. She enjoys taking selfies of her own and post photos on Instagram. I don't mean to interfere her privacy, but I care about her security online! I don't want her to contact some suspicious guys or have any inappropriate behaviors! I have to do something necessary to know what she is doing online, who she is talking with.

Being a father who loves my daughter more than anyone else, I have tried different ways to settle this headache issue. All I want is to ensure my honeys safety.

1. Sit down and talk with kids
Whenever the age changes, talk is always the most effective way of solving disputes and problems. However busy I am, I often manage to talk with my daughter. As a result, I know what she has been doing recently. I also know whether she has some trouble or maintains a close connection with someone I don't know. I will remind her when necessary. Try to be a friend to your children.

2. Often play and travel with them
Whenever my kid requires, I often try to participate in her school activities. No matter who you are in society, in children's eyes, you are always the greatest person in the world. Give your children a sense of security so that they trust and rely on you. In such a case, they won't feel isolated and look for emotional comfort from strangers.

3. Monitor childrens mobile activities when necessary
Sometimes monitoring their mobile activities is also a feasible way to [keep children away from sexual predators](http://blog.ikeymonitor.com/protect-children-from-online-predators.html). After all, teenagers are not old mature enough to judge who are good and who are evil. If you always know what they talk online, you may detect whether potential dangers may happen to them. You can also take action to avoid trouble in advance. I recommend iKeyMonitor to parents who have the same concern with me. I have used it on my daughters iPhone. Everything works well so far. But I told my child about the monitoring and also made myself clear that I have no intention to interfere her privacy. I just want to keep her secure and help her detect anything wrong. She said yes to this!


Well, this is what I have done to keep my child safe from predators and dangers. What will you do to keep your kids away from sexual predators like the middle aged teacher in the news? I hope to get more meaningful suggestions. Don't hesitate to write down your opinions here.
