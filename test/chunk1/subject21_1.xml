	<TEXT> Yes. My abuser "left" me at a very turbulent time in my life. I was having anxiety attacks multiple times a day. It's been two years of him stalking me. As tapirouette said, my first relationship was another N. 

Good on you for leaving your abuser. That is so brave. I wish you well. Stay strong. I hope you find happiness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, my Nparents and I talked about me going to the uni I got a scholarship for. My Ndad started in on me hard. Here are some highlights:

"Ruin your life, I don't care."
"You didn't deserve to graduate high school."
"I am more than happy to watch your life fall apart because I won't help you fix it anymore."

Nmom was more than happy to egg him on.

I lost $76000 in scholarships and grants and possibly $30000 more that hadn't been processed. I am so disappointed that my Nparents bullied me out of that opportunity. This means I am stuck I'm their house with my Nsister for at least 2 more years. It hurt to hear my parents say those things. 

I live in a nice neighborhood. I preface with this because we have renters next door and they aren't the best people. I was doing chores yesterday  (mowing thr lawn, weeding, etc) and found a beer can and snickers wrappers being the tree near my window. Our neighbor's son will walk by my window to the subdivision being outs and look in my window. Finding the trash makes me think he's watching me at night. I told Ndad and he shrugged and said it could have been carried by raccoons (slightly rural area). We've caught him watching me when I'm mowing and washing my car, and I've walked into my room to see him jogging away from my windo. My Nparents aren't too concerned. I want to go to the HOA, but Ndad wants to get concrete evidence. I also have an abusive  ex boyfriend that stalks me, so I'm already on edge and this is scary. I feel like I'm overreacting because my Nparents are so cavalier about it.

I got to my neurologist last Friday. I was getting the results of some tests to see if I have MS. My neuro thinks I have a possible dual diagnosis of MS and Parkinson's. Ndad came to the appointment and vehemently denied this. My doctor recommend going to the Mayo Clinic and Ndad said he'd check if insurance covered it. He then told me yesterday that it isn't worth looking into. So I'm doing it myself. Nmom saw me looking and yelled at me for going behind her and Ndad's backs. 

I am so depressed. I don't want to live in my house anymore. I'm too tired to fight back against my Nfamily anymore. Do I become complacent until I can leave? I made a back account in my name on Thursday and am applying for jobs left and right. I need to get to Mayo to find out what's wrong with me. I'm so depressed, my anxiety is at a peak, and i'm falling back into old patterns of OCD and anorexia. I don't feel safe talking to anyone but my therapists and two teachers, but I graduated so I can't see the teachers.

What do I do? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you do not have to respond to her. that is passive aggressive behavior and she is guilt tripping you. 

good for you for making a change! that's a huge step. you are in control. 

I can't link it (I'm in mobile) but there is an article my therapist told me about. just Google "how to play a narcissist in robot mode". it might make your Nmom angry, but you need to protect YOU. you are very important. 

good luck! you're on the right path.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I graduated on Saturday. my sophomore and junior years were really hard for me  I was in and out of treatment for an eating disorder and in a really abusive relationship. I made it, though. I got into a private uni on a scholarship and had really good grades. 

so, Saturday I wake up and get ready to leave. I had to be at the auditorium by 7:30. the entire morning Nmom was making comments on how she didn't like my makeup my dress, my shoes. I dyed my hair the day before (copper on top, black on the bottom) and Nmom and Nsister said it didn't look good on me and how much they hate it. Ndad said it will make him look bad at work. 

I'm about to leave and Nmom says I should go with them. they needed to be the for 8:30, an hour after I needed to. I explained that and Nmom started yelling at me, saying I was ungrateful for not accepting a ride, that I didn't love her, the usual. I left feeling really guilty and upset. 

Nmom invited her parents (who are also Ns). after the ceremony, they were saying things like "we can't believe you actually graduated, we thought you'd have to be held back" or "oh, you weren't valedictorian? guess you didn't try hard enough". it was so hard to listen to. I was in the top quarter of my class and they made it sound like a failure. 

we went out to dinner and Nmom was upset because she didn't like where I wanted to go (Japanese steakhouse). I said we could go somewhere else and she kept guilting me. Ngrandparents kept bringing up politics and social issues and how my views are wrong (I'm liberal, Nfamily is conservative). 

we get home and Nparents were saying they wasted a day of their three day weekend. if. you saw my last post, I was undergoing tests for MS. I saw my neurologist and I showed markers for MS and Parkinson's. Nmom told her parents this and they said I was over exaggerating and my doctor is lying. Ndad says my symptoms are from being vegetarian. 

all day I was being picked apart and I was so upset. all I wanted was to feel proud of myself and I was torn to the ground. the whole day ended up revolving around Nmom and Nsister. 

side note... does your Nfamily try to make you out to be the bad guy or find a way to blame everything on you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> last year, my abusive boyfriend left me. I was pretty much Stockholmed by him. I actually still catch myself defending him a year later. 

anyway, he was the "no one will ever love you except me" kinda guy. physical and emotional abuse were his main thing. eventually, he raped me and left.

I was going through CBT at the time for anorexia, depression, a few anxiety disorders, and OCD. my ED got really bad really fast. I felt like I needed to disappear so he could never see me again. if he couldn't see me, he couldn't hurt me (he actually follows me around town, blocks my car into spaces, tailgates me, all that shit).it was also a punishment thing. like I did something wrong, not him. from July to August, I lost a lot of weight and was hospitalized at a facility. that was a clusterfuck, but a story for another time. 

anyway, those doctors. defended his actions (I led him on, I was too needy, I enabled him, etc). I left.in October and proceeded to destroy myself until January when I was hospitalized again. I nearly died because of my weight. 

so, yeah. TL:DR, boyfriend abused me, traumatized me, eating disorder spiraled out of control, went into treatment twice, nearly died. 

unfortunately, OP, I'm still trying to get over it, so no advice for you. sorry for the long post. also sorry for errors, I'm on mobile.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can give perspective from the other side. I have an eating disorder - I've been in treatment three times and am in therapy. My Nmom likes to think that 1) it was stress that made me lose weight and 2) now that I'm weight restored, I don't have an ED. Now she just likes to comment about how I look in different things.

What your parents did is not okay. That is terrible. I am so sorry you've had to deal with that. Is she trying to maybe get attention? There was a story on here a while back about someone's Nmom sending then to a facility and telling all the friends/family how sick her daughter was. When released, the Nmom made a huge deal about how much her daughter was/wasn't eating.  </TEXT>
