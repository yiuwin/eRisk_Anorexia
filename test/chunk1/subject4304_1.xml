	<TEXT> Hello all,

I am having a little trouble with Brandenburg in the early game.  In the past 3 tries, I have gone bankrupt, been crippled by Poland and screwed up alliances, resulting in me having to restart.

Bearing in mind this is iron man, what advice would you have? I would appreciate a full strategy guide, as there is no longer one on the wiki.

Many thanks. </TEXT>

A - the war is over and Ulfric is Dead.

B - I did the quest to spite the Thalmor, who I hate with all my being.

Ottomans are a bit blobby at the moment, I would like to expand into Greece but without strong allies I know that will be a pain. At the moment I have only my long time ally France and Bosnia.

Where should I go from here? I have achieved my goal for the run, which is form Italy. I'm a bit late to the party to try for Colonies, and expanding into Africa is blocked by the ottomans. I know I will have to take them on at some point, I just have no idea how.

Where might I acquire the next best armour?

I have also installed immersive armours. Does a list of all of those armours exist, with the armour values?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My sister has been using my gaming rig for playing Sims 4, and it is starting to become intollerable as we both seem to want to use it at the same time. She has asked our mother for a new laptop for her Birthday in march.

Anyway, she wants a laptop that will play Sims 4 at a reasonable framerate (around 30fps) at moderate graphics settings. That is pretty much the only requirement.

She will also need to be able to do homework on it, but if it can handle Sims 4 I'm fairly certain it will be fine with MS Word!

Budget is around 400 tops. I have looked at Lappylist and, while helpful, it seems very exclusive towards intel processors and Nvidia graphics cards, but when looking at a budget laptop these components are too expensive, so compromise on that, AMD is fine on both fronts.

thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In light of what appears to be an agressive move against the Union, the Presidency has ordered the construction of military bases along the Zambia border, to protect against Zimbabwean aggression.

These military bases will be servicible by air, once the air force is actually functional again.

The bases will take approximately six months to a year to construct and 500,000 USD to construct.

We will add an additional two bases near the middle of the Country, these will be considerably larger permanent bases at a cost of 2 million USD.

EDIT: costing and additional bases.

EDIT2: In light of a Zimbabwean guarantee of no aggression, we will reduce the amount of these bases actually along the border to just two, and will relocate the other 5 further into the Country. The other, more permentant bases will remain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Earlier today, the Department of Land was approached by a team of ambassadors from the Central African Republic, requesting to join the UCAR, apparently bowled over by the UCAR's radical new economic reforms which have revolutionised the economy and rebooted international trade.

Of course, we were more than willing, so today the UCAR welcomed a new state into it's family.

The constitutional governmental system which now applies to the other nations of the union will also apply to them.

	<TITLE> [DIPLOMACY]/[EXPANSION]Kinshasa Conference Concludes: Union of Central African Republics founded! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-11 22:22:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Kinshasa Conference has concluded with monumental consequences. As of right now, the four attending nations of Gabon, Angola and the Republic of Congo have agreed a historical deal to unite the four countries under a federal Government.

The Governmental system will work as such:

Each Republic will have it's own assembly, elected every 5 years, each consisting of 600 MPs. They will then elect MPs to sit in Union House, the federal lawmaking assembly, also every five years.

Each national assembly will have a head of government, and a High Councillor who will sit in the High Council as personal advisers to the Presidency.

Presidential elections will take place every seven years, with the president retaining Power of Decree, and as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.

The elections planned for two months from now will now constitute the entirety of the new nation.

And with that, Good Day, and Long live the UCAR! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The President of the DRC has ordered a radical shakeup of the Armed Forces.

As it stands, there are almost 20,000 soldiers who are over 60 years old. These men will be retired with immediate effect and given a sufficient pension to see them through.

We also announce the introduction of National Service. From next month, all males between the ages of 18 and 25 will be required to register at their local Armed Forces office.

There will also be an increase in Defence spending from 2.5% of gdp to 5% of GDP to facilitate the new national service recruits.

The National Service recruits will be instructed in fieldcraft, weaponry and basic literacy to give them a decent standing in life after service.

They will also be used a labour force for a radical shake-up of the nation's infrastructure, more on that in a different announcement. </TEXT>

You can build Naval support buildings for your own fleet but you can't build anything which could discourage a seaborne invasion, such as a shore battery or fort. It could work, for example, by increasing blockade atrition or a percentage chance to sink one or more enemy ships.

Any other thoughts?
