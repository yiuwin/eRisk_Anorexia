	<TEXT> Both my mom and my ex ask my weight on a weekly basis, and my ex asks me if I'm on drugs as well (we have a child together so it's still necessary for us to communicate pretty frequently.)  I'm gonna start asking my mom how much she weighs everytime she asks me :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I friggin love being skinny.
I've been borderline obese and i have to say, it feels SO good to be able to just throw on whatever and not have to worry if I look fat or if it's flattering enough or whatever.  Saves a lot of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> probably something as simple as makeup accentuates the features.  It's the same thing as looking at a picture that's highlighted and colored, outlined and shaded, compared to one that is not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I struggled with binge eating for a time, probably for a little under a year, and it was the most terrifying thing I ever went through.  I felt so out control and scared and ashamed.  I would count the days I would go without binging and rarely made it to week.  It felt like everyone I confided in would just shrug it off or underplay it and I wanted to cry and list the foods I would eat in one sitting but I was just too embarrassed.

I dont know exactly what stopped it.  I cut down on drinking a lot and went back to gym and that helped.  I still struggle with it time to time.  I'm sorry you're struggling with it, it really is an emotionally debilitating thing and not a joke. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I follow the esports community and if you're a girl in the scene you're pretty much gonna shit on no matter what, especially in twitch chat.  Well there's a female shoutcaster that pretty recently started casting in the world championships of a certain game, and she's pretty much the only female caster right now.  She's definitely in the overweight category, and she predictably gets a lot hate for it in twitch chat.  

I've always liked her, I think she's pretty damn good at her job, definitely better than some of the more popular male casters, and it was cool to finally see a woman in the scene.  

A few days ago she posted a tweet regarding something said in twitch chat that basically said, "finally, someone knows the difference between fat and curvy!"

Lost some respect for her. :(  Like I dont really care that you're kind of fat but dont deny it ugh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i know from experience that if the baby is too young to hold the bottle themselves you shouldn't really prop it against something to keep it in their mouth because if they dont get a firm latch they're gonna swallow a lot of air and spit it all up.  wouldnt call it child abuse or anything its just kind of a stupid lazy thing to do imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When they first put me on an efexor and neurontin combo it severely decreased my appetite.  Not sure which med it was, and it stabled out after a while. Probably depends on the person.  I've been on a lot of antidepressants and only 1 or 2 made me feel like a had a bigger appetite.  </TEXT>
