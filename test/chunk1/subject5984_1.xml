	<TEXT> The last match is usually never the best, its the biggest storyline but probably won't be the best match for example:
WM3: Steamboat-Savage is a better match then Andre-Hogan
WM10: The ladder match easily beats Hart-Yokozuna
WM25: HBK-Taker is easily a better match then cena-show-edge and HHH-Orton
Pretty much the entire punk-bryan rivalry  then the cena/ace/show stuff
WM21: Alot of people will say Angle vs HBK was better then HHH-Batista </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't really say but I can see it being kinda like attitude but not as violent of edgy content. Like maybe something we're going thru right now where we have the Y2J-CM Drunk storyline which is one of the better ones we've seen in awhile. Plus they've slightly let blood back (which will probably go away again) without being used ala Flair who bleeds just to bleed but to enhance the story like when Punk was spitting up blood the night Y2J poured whiskey all over him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes and no. Yes as in it hurt wrestlers having places to go work. Also with no competition the product became stale, but it didn't only become stale just because of that it was one of those periods like the early to mid 90's where the big names started disappearing because of injuries, too old, or just plain retired which I think hurt the business more then people mention. Which also required the building of new stars which seems to be taking longer to do now that there is really only one place it happens. One thing also is sadly people need to realize attitude just wont cut it anymore (just look at TNA). That time is dead we are no longer the larger fan base for wrestling it is now the 5-17 year olds that's the fanbase now like during the attitude era most of those 90,000+ fans that filled the Silverdome for Wrestlemania III turn on Raw or Nitro and would just think a bloodbath had broke out and wonder why these matches had all these weapons and what happened to what they use to watch on Saturday nights on TBS and whenever WWF programming was on back in those days. The same to the fans of wrestling during the 70's and 60's during the 80's boom wondering why is that guy wearing face paint and what the hell is a papa shango or any other gimmick when they came from the old territory days when the NWA Champ would come once year and everything was pretty much mat based wrestling. </TEXT>
