	<TEXT> I have super sensitive oily acne-prone skin. I,m having problems to clean my face. I bought banila co. clean it classic and it brought me out badly. I went back to my usual Avene Micellar water and Corsx low ph good morning cleanser. I use it with a konjac sponge. I want an oily based cleanser that don,t break me out because micellar water takes forever to remove my sunblocker and make up. Any suggestion?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, I've just logged in and saw your incredible answer. I'm so greatfull you took the time to write these awesome tips.

I saw my new OBGYN (I changed because my regular one was being not helpful at all with any of my issues). She ordered a full blood test to see my hormones and also my cholesterol, etc, and I told her about Metformine, she said that she doesn't prescribe it unless I'm trying to conceive, she offered me to start with birth control pills to get my cycles regular, but I really don't want to take them, last time I did it was such a bad experience. I'm thinking about getting pregnant, but I'll start trying next year (I want to loose weight first and get sure I'm healthy). 

I'd look for myo-inositol, it's kind of hard to have it here in Spain, but maybe I'll try to find it online, perhaps I'll get luckier. I forget to say I'm taking Spiruline, I read in many places is very good...

Thank you very much for your good wishes and kindness :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Advise for supplements: keto/PCOS </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-01 00:50:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello,

I've trying to figure it out myself but I find it very complicated to start my journey into supplements by myself. I started a keto diet two months ago and I started searching for some supplements in order to keep up my vitamins, zinc, magnesium, fiber... But I ended up here and now I think I need a thousand things.

I'm 31 yo, female and I have PCOS and severe insomnia (I have insomnia since 17yo, I've tried everything from melatonin, yoga, meditation to hypnotics, and nowaday I just accept I won't ever get a whole night sleep) and recently developed some light acne problems. I'm seeing my OBGYN tomorrow and get tested for my hormones levels. 

I'm taking Psyllium Fibre (1000 gr per day) and Vitamin D3 (2000 gr per day)

Any suggestion would be much appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it's a zinc oxide based sunscreen, but I think I'm cleaning it right (with double cleansing and everything), I guess I broke out because I over exfoliated and I started using too many products at once, now I'm starting again, but I'm looking for a proper chemical sunsceen for no-swimming time. I was thinking about Biore Watery Sunscreen, I've read is good for sensitive acne-prone skin, but I'm not sure... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello!

I'm struggling with the research of a sunscreen. I went to my dermatologist last week because I broke out so badly, I'm still figuring out why... I'm Spanish (NC 44) and live near the beach, I go swimming everyday to the pool, and for that I'm wearing a mineral suncreen (bioderma), but is super thick and leaves a terrible white cast (even violet) so I can't wear for my day. I'm looking terrible right now and even scared to use moisturizer, but I need a good sunscreen. Also I'm looking for a primer for the times I wear makeup.
Any suggestion would help me. </TEXT>

It's so good to know, actually I was thinking in buying some, I have been looking online, now I read you, I'll wait :) I have an appointment with my gyn in two weeks, and I'm thinking about telling her about a treatment for my PCOS in order to regulate ovulation. I don't know if there are PCOS treatment that are non birth control pills, but I suppose there has to be something. I keep on eating well and exercising for now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally agree. I want the same: to improve his wellbeing, nothing else, I really get sad when I hear him complaining 24/7, but he just trust anything we are suppose too, even if it means to see that evidences are overwhelmingly wrong, and seeing that this actually works! I've just decided I'm never trying again to "convince" him, I'll just keep doing it right and hoping one day he opens his eyes by himself. My best wishes to you with your dad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so touched to read your post, my situation is so similar. My dad (64) is Type 2 diabetic, gluten intolerant, high pressure and cholesterol, and I'm really trying to talk him through keto but he not only doesn't listen to me, he thinks that I'm so wrong, even when he sees the results. His doctor only readjusted his insuline and he tells me over and over that I'm doing an unhealthy diet and that he can't do that due to high pressure and cholesterol, we even fought about that... I don't know what to do...

I really hope you get lucky with your dad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello,

I've been tracking my foods in MFP, I reseted my macros to my keto calculator results and now I find that I'm having problems to keep my: 20 carbs/20protein/60 fat ratio. Always short of fats and too many proteins. 

Can you give me tips for +fat-proteins options?

And another non related question: what can I add to my coffee that is not stevia and don't have carb input? I've read a lot about it  and I'm confused.

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so happy you tell me that. I really didn't think about it before because I was really sick and basically taking care of my own health, mental and physical. Now, as I'm much better, I'm working, living with my boyfriend and trying to stay healthy I really would like to have my own family and sometimes I think that as I had an eating desorder and PCOS I won't get pregnant. I'm going definitely to take your advice, have vitamins, any suggestion in which ones? and take care of my health.

Thanks! </TEXT>

I actually signed in MFP and I've input my breakfast and lunch, and it says that I have to eat 600 more calories, now I was thinking to have for dinner a tuna - egg salad and i checked for calories, but I have this question:

-How do I really know the calories if they don't show the recipes?
-How much salad can I eat?

I hope you can help me, it's kind of confusing as is my first day... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I keep track of my mental health, I know I don't sound optimistic, even depressing, but I'm really getting better and my main goal last year was to definitely say goodbye to my alimentary disorder that had taken control over my life. I don't want to take antidepressives or anti anxiety meds because I usually have many secondary effects, but I go to a therapist every month and so far I'm doing good. I just get obsessed with my age quite often and being overweight is not helping at all. 

Thank you for the tips, I'm trying to do lots of salads and green vegs and no carbs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone,

I'm a 31 years old and overweight at the moment. I'm 158cm (5'2'') and 79,4kg (175 lb) and have been struggling with my body since I was a child. Last three years have been specially complicated for me, I have been dealing with depression and bulimia and from december 2015 to february 2016 I was hospitalized because of bulimia's worsening. Finally, in early march I started being better with the desorder and ready to start a healthy and normal way to loose my weight, not wanting to go back to my old habits. It's being hard, I have PCOS and I don't loose weight easily at all, but I'm trying. Sometimes I feel I'm getting old and I've wasted most of my life already, and that feeling makes me feel very sad and overwhelmed, sometimes I think I'll never be able to have children because I'm old and I've made such a mess with my body.
Still, I don't want to loose hope. I'm following a low carbs diet since last month and a half and swimming 3 or 4 hours a week, and I've lost 7 kg (15,4 lb) since december 10th.
My main problems are: I'm extremely lazy to do regular exercise and I have sleeping problems, so at night I feel like eating, also I have a good apetite. Every tip is so very welcome.
Thank you in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much. The four products post is very very helpful. I did it this morning, coming back to my last moisturer (korres pomegranate for oily skin), that moisturizer itchs a little bit, I didn't remember, i'm super sensitive, the Benton steam cream didn't itch. I used the avene spf50 I used before too, because now I know the bb cream is not really sunscreen...

I hope my skin comes back to normal and I can start using the new products soon. Btw, I was looking for the patch testing post, but I don't find it, could you help me?

	<TEXT> Thank you. I'll keep looking for a sunscreen, I live in a very hot place all year long, and the sun is pretty vertical here, so I need one. I started today to use Avene full coverage spf50, it has physical filters, and I would like to use chemical ones, but I'm worried about clogging as you mentioned. I read about two that keep my attention, but I don't want to spend more money without being well informed at least, they are: 

-The FACE Shop Natural Sun Eco Sebum Control Moisture Sun SPF40 PA+++ 
-Innisfree ECO SAFETY NOSEBUM SUN MILK SPF50+ PA+++ 

I also read about a japanese one somewhere online, the features seem to be promising:

-Naruko Tea tree anti acne sunscreen 50spf 

(I would copy the link, but I'm still figuring out how to post here, sorry). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, I copied the morning cleanser twice by mistake, but I actually only use it once in the morning and once in the afternoon.
Thank you, I thought it was sunscreen... 
Yes, I'm cutting off every product I think and try to see if my skin calms down. 
I read the four steps post, 

-Can I also keep my prescription creams? When do I apply them then?

I added everything in the past month. Before I was using random things I got at home, I needed new products so I started digging around and found about AS... I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed with my skin right now, it's so bad and I'm so worried it gets worse, also I haven't been using spf for what I now know.

Thank you very much. </TEXT>

This is my first post, I hope it's ok. I'm worried with my routine. I started to learn about korean skincare a few month ago and I get fascinated, I've just moved back to my hometown from some month living in mainland Europe and I felt my skin was getting worse from the climate or change, I'm not sure. But before I discovered this fantastic place to learn about everything, I just jumped in and bought my 10 steps without really know and start to use them all in once. My skin started to improve quickly but lately (the past week) i've been having some breakouts and I'm worried. Is because of that I wanted to post my actual rutine and see if you could help me somehow. Thank you in advance.

She is 58 years old, has oily skin with freckels, not many wrinkles, but they start to show and she want a day moisturizer that absorbs fast for the morning. We lives in southern Spain, so it's hot in here... She uses SPF appart so it doesn't need to have it. I would really appreciate it. Thank you very much. </TEXT>
