	<TEXT> I really don't want this to seem like a rant, because it's not. More of an observation. 

So today my daughter and I played dress-up. She was a princess and I was batman. After we finished, I took her to school. I'm a huge nerd, so being dressed up as batman made me happy, so i decided that since I had nothing to do all day and nowhere to go, I was going to wear my batman costume. I realize this is weird, but hey, do what makes you happy right?

Anyway, towards the end of the day, I realized we were out of salad mix, so I popped over to the grocery store and got some dressed like this http://i.imgur.com/ucuR31b.jpg . I got a lot of smiles from people and a few "Hey! Batman!" type comments. I felt good. Anyway, I was thinking about it today and I realized something.

When I was 132 lbs heavier, if I had walked into a grocery store dressed as batman, I would have gotten much different reactions. As a nerdy fat girl, I got a lot of negativity for my weirdness. Now when I do weird or nerdy things, it's considered "quirky" and "cute". Even when I went to the store today, I wasn't nervous about people thinking I was a freak. I know I would have been 132 lbs ago.  Today I just thought "Meh, I'm an attractive girl. Nobody is going to care." I realize some of this could be due to me having more self-confidence, but I don't think it's all just in my head. I think society also has something to do with it. 

Growing up fat, I always felt like I had to develop my personality and be funny and really nice. I'm the same person now as I was then, but now, people tell me "You're a really cool person!" or "You're so funny!"  etc, and I'm thinking "I was always a cool person. I was always funny."

Anyone else notice anything like this now that they are slimmer?

	<TITLE> Stress eating. I have a theory! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-24 20:32:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, my boyfriend was mentioning to me that he thinks that stress makes him eat. He has a stressful job (He is a staff sergeant in the Army, and has been in for 17 years). This made me think back to my undergraduate anthropology class:

Now, I really loved the anthropology class I took a few years ago. I though it was so interesting to see traits that we as people have, and go back to "cave man" days and see where those traits/behaviors came from. One thing I found interesting was how the "fight or flight" response has changed. When we get stressed out, it triggers this response, but now, it's getting tripped by a mid-term instead of being chased by a rhino.  In the past, getting chased by a rhino only lasted 1-5 min (I'm ball-parking here). After the event, we either had gotten away or died. With a mid-term however, we could be stressed about it for weeks, and that makes us experience the fight or flight response (stress) for far longer than we were originally intended to, and it does harm to our bodies. So over time, this life saving response can actually now make us more unhealthy. 

So anyway, I was doing some thinking about why we stress eat. None of what I am about to say has been backed up by research or science, it's just my musings:

What do you think the three top concerns of our ancestors were? I'd gather it would go back to our three primal instincts/needs. Shelter, Food and Procreation (In that order). So let's look at food. So let's say you have a family of cave-people and they are hungry. They can't just go to a store and get food, they have to find it, hunt it, and kill it in order to survive. They don't know where their next meal is coming from. This worries them, as it should, because if they were not stressed/worried/concerned about where their next meal was coming from, they would die. So my hypothesis is that, when we are stressed out in today's world, it might cause some of us to go back to a basic and instinctual  part of our brains that immediately things "We're stressed, we need to eat" even if we are worried about something that isn't food related.  

Also, if we go back to the "Shelter, Food, Procreation" list, it also might explain why I feel like I need to eat every time I come home? I don't know. Once again, just hypothesizing here. I mean our first instinct is to find shelter, so once I get home, that gets crossed off the list, and I want to fill my belly. 

I basically bring this up because I though other people might find it interesting. I'm also interested if any of you have thought of any theories like this in reference to weight loss. Also, even though we as higher thinking individuals are responsible for our actions and using self control, I thought it might make some of you feel better to know that we might have an evolutionary disposition to eat while we are stressed.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What one month of lifting did to my butt. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-20 05:09:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok, so I'm terrified to post here. I know next to nothing about weight-lifting, only the program my boyfriend has me on. He has trained several people in weight lifting so I just leave it up to him, for now, as to what I do. 

One thing I kept asking him was "how soon will I see results?" He just shrugged and told me everyone is different. Well, here is my before and after of my butt, after one month of dedicated lifting. My biggest worry about my body was my lack of a butt (after losing 132 lbs) and so I'm on a quest to get a nice new butt. Maybe this could be helpful to you guys if someone you know might want to see 1-month progress. It's not much, but you can tell a difference. I'm loving lifting, and I think I'll be at it a long time.

	<TEXT> So this is Kemo. My boyfriend got him when he was over a year old, and he didn't want to change his name because he already responded to Kemo. Boyfriend got him in Hawii, and Kemo is the Hawaiian name for James (or so I am told). We mostly just call him Bubba though. 

This was him, I believe, soon after my boyfriend got him (I didn't know him back then) http://i.imgur.com/xrO906I.jpg   Nice, slim dog. Handsome boy, no? Well,over time he started gaining weight due to inactivity, table scraps, apartment life, and having a very busy (but very loving!) soldier for a dad. This picture was taken i think, a few months before I met them. He must have been 6 or so years old in this picture http://i.imgur.com/7TgcgFg.jpg

Well, about halfway through my weight loss journey, I started going on long walks because I was determined to get the dog into a healthy weight range. I also put him on diet dog food. We had stopped giving him junk-food as soon as the boyfriend and I started dating. I think in this picture, he had already lost maybe 4 lbs. http://i.imgur.com/XbwzWKa.jpg

I took him to the vet a few months ago and the vet was very excited to say he had lost 10 lbs. I weighed him today and he is down 14 lbs now. Here's his official before and after photo. 

http://i.imgur.com/4V72VyY.jpg

From 70 lbs, to 56. He needs to lose another 5-10 lbs, but he seems way healthier and happier now. I'm happy.

	<TEXT> I was just told by one of my oldest and dearest friends (In a very loving and supportive way) that I am turning into one of those attention-whoring self-obsessed people. (My words, not her's)

I talk about weight and diet and exercise 24/7. I Post selfies of my progress a ton on here and facebook, and I am always wondering what the girl next to me weighs, because I compare myself to everyone. I'm pretty sure I'm more obsessed with myself than the average person my size who has never been fat. A co-worker of mine casually mentioned last week, that it's weird that I tell people I used to be fat all the time. I HATED my ex room mate for doing this and now I do it. 

How do I fix this? I suspected it, but this cinches it. I need a whole new kind of lifestyle change. What do I do? I'm addicted to the attention.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My mother and father were both missionary kids. My mom grew up in Korea and Africa and my dad in Chile and Argentina. Needless to say, they were raised very staunch Christians. From the ages of 0-8 or 9, my brother and I were raised in the baptist church. My mom felt after a while, like being baptist wasn't for her. She always felt this distance from god, so she decided she needed to find him. They converted to a more spiritual church that had dancing in the isles, and speaking in tongues and fainting and barking on the floor. We were there from ages 8-11 or 12. My mom then, once again, felt distance from god, so she decided to go back to the roots and we joined a messianic synagogue, which turned out to be a cult. 


My entire family was horribly abused by this cult for about 5 years. It's one of those things in my life I've had to talk about extensively in therapy. This thread is not about my time in the cult. After the cult broke up, my mom converted to regular Judaism (ones that don't believe Jesus was the son of god). At around this time my brother went off to college and I soon followed. He and I were on opposite ends of the country, but we both slowly came to the conclusion that there was no god. My mom then converted to kabbalah, which I have to say, so far, is the religion I like the most that they have tried. I still don't believe in it at all, but kabbalah opened doors for my parents where they could start believing in and studying science.  They learned about evolution among other things, because kabbalah tends to go along with a lot of general accepted science. 


ANYWAY, through all of this, I have always seen my mom being the spiritual searcher and my dad has been a follower. My mom feels god and hungers for god and my dad, at least to me, has always seemed like he was playing along. I felt like maybe he really wanted to feel god, but I never got the same sort of genuine hunger that my mom had, from him. 


Fast forward to a few days ago. Brother and I were in town, visiting our parents. They both know and accept that we are atheists. After maybe 2-3 drinks each (between my dad and I) I let it slip. I said You know, I think mom genuinely believes in god, but I don't know if you do. My dad responded You know one of the members of our kabbalah group said that your mother and I have been tied together through several lifetimes. We were meant to be together. Even if I don't feel it as strongly as she does, I am meant to be with her and follow her. Our souls are bound together. I nodded and said Yeah, and that's really cool. I know you love her more than anything. Still, even if it's all not true, even if there is no reincarnation, even if there is no afterlife, just think about how many billions of people are on the planet. Think about how many people have died. Think of how many are yet to be born. Even if there is no god, the fact that you have found someone so special and perfect for you, that you love so much... I mean, isn't that still pretty fucking special? It's amazing. 


He paused. His face froze. He took a moment and nodded. Then he said I think you're right. I think I don't believe in god. and I said Well, we've had a few drinks. and he said I;m not drunk. I just don't think I believe in god. This is blowing my mind right now. I seriously think you nailed it. (He looked a bit shaky at this point.) 


Well the evening wrapped up. I went home, brother went home. A few days later I talked to my brother and he told me dad is still saying he doesn't believe in god. He apparently told his kabbalah group he doesn't believe in god too. I haven't talked to my mom about it yet. I hope I haven't caused a rift between them. I had no idea saying something so simple would jar him so easily. I can't imagine being 55 and coming to grips with the idea that your whole life might have been spent in dedication to a lie. 


Basically I'm just looking for tips on how to help him. For me, the biggest problem I've had with atheism is that I am now terrified of death. I have no idea how to handle it. How am I supposed to help him? I've wished so many times I could go back to believing in god, because I am PETRIFIED of death, but no matter how hard I try, I just can't go back. I can't un-learn what I know. How am I supposed to help him? This might seem silly, but I'm worried about my dad. 

EDIT: I know I said I didn't want to talk about the cult, but after a few PMs and comments I figured I should clarify. As much as it seems like it in my post, my mother is not crazy or dangerous. She even encourages me to blaze my own path and supports my decision to be an atheist. 

I can't speak for all cults, but at least in mine, you would be surprised at how sane everyone was (or at least saner than you might think). Many cults (like mine) happen because a group of people who are hungry for meaning in their life beyond the norm, are exploited by a bad person (cult leader). I think every adult in my cult knew in the back of their minds that something was horribly wrong. Nobody mentioned it though,because they feared the cult turning on them, so they just played along. Little did they know everyone else was also playing along and having the same doubts. So basically being in a cult is much like playing "The Emperor's New Clothes" with a sadistic psychopath.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm 25, female, divorced three years ago. My ex husband (27 M) and I have a 4 year old daughter. We get along ok. The first year after our divorce, we were pretty nasty to one another, but have since come together as "partners" in loving and raising our daughter. I say partners in quotes because he pays no child support, visits his kid maybe once a month, and she never spends the night at his house. That being said, I'm pretty sure he loves our daughter and she loves him very much. He's not a bad person. He is pretty ok most of the time. 


So I have two jobs and am in graduate school. Needless to say, almost every second of my day, I am busy. My ex husband lives with his grandmother and has a part time job (that he just got a few weeks ago.) The thing is, every time he has a concern about his daughter, or wants to tell me something, he always demands that I drive to his house (an hour away) and talk to him about it in person. He is so dramatic. He refuses to talk to me on the phone about anything and always acts like every concern of his, requires a planned out face-to-face discussion. He does this every 6 weeks or so. Now, he wants to talk again and he wont tell me what it's about, and I pretty much told him that he can call me and talk about it, or deal with it on his own, but I'm not going to blow 3 hours of my day to come over and talk. Am I being unreasonable? The last time he wanted me to come over, it turned out his girlfriend was pregnant. The time before that, he wanted to talk about if I was ever going to change our daughter's last name (I'm not). Both times felt like a waste of time for me. 

tl;dr is it necessary to discuss everything in person?  </TEXT>

Did you have any other pictures?" and I told her "Umm I tried really hard to avoid cameras when I was big." I thought about it for a while, and slowly dredged up a memory of one of my best friends almost crying, begging me to be in her wedding photos because she loved me and wanted to remember me there. I went on her facebook and dug around for almost an hour and found this. Holy shit. I don't even think I realized how big I was. I think back then, my body dysmorphia worked in reverse to protect me from realizing just how big I was. It's so nice not to run from cameras anymore. I just can't stop looking at this.

	<TITLE> Should EXTREME obesity be considered a mental illness? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-13 06:04:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  

I've been thinking about this for a while. I realize it's a touchy subject, so I'm going to be very deliberate with my wording. I just want to discuss this really, because I don't have an opinion one way or another and I would like to hear your's. When I hit 270 and started to lose weight, I knew I was on my own. I had done hundreds of diets and failed, but this time I didn't. It's one of the hardest things I have ever done. 


When I was hospitalized for bulimia (and other eating related issues), They were very aggressive with me. My husband at the time, was briefed on how to help me. The scales were forcibly removed from my home. My food intake was monitored and every time I went to the bathroom, everyone was keeping an ear out. I recovered very well because I had such a strong support system. 


So, I'm wondering, with people who have EXTREME obesity (as in, it is literally killing them quickly), should that be treated as a mental illness? Do you think it would be easier for the extremely obese to lose weight if they had an aggressive support system?  I'm not taking a stand either way, I'm just curious. I know being 50 lbs overweight is much healthier than being 50 lbs underweight, so I want to reiterate, that when I say extreme obesity, I'm talking about people who, for example, have diabetes and are not changing their diet and losing limbs. Or someone who can't walk. People can force bulimics and anorexics to get help if they are deemed a threat to themselves. Why not for the other end of the spectrum?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Knowing When to Quit </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-10 22:32:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Well I think I have discussed this subject with several of you before, but I find myself again contemplating what my goal weight/bf%/measurements should be. This post is going to be long, with a lot of pictures, but I appreciate you guy's inputs very much. I don't think I could have gotten this far in a healthy way without you all. 

So I have Body Dimorphic Disorder (BDD), which I think might be the cause of my issue. My original goal weight was 149, because that was the weight that would put me into a healthy BMI range. As I got close to 149, I decided I still felt pretty chunky, and decided to re-calibrate my goal to 130. 130 would put me dead center of my healthy BMI range. I am now at 138 lbs. I was stuck at 140 for months, and the last two pounds have come off PAINFULLY slowly. I know it gets harder to lose weight, the smaller you get, but it seemed to me, that as soon as I hit 140, my body just completely locked up and refused to lose weight without extreme long-term effort on my part.  All the while I had friends and family members telling me I didn't need to lose any more weight. But heck, they told me that when I was at 160 and 170 and 180 too, so I am used to ignoring them at this point. 

Well, today I was talking to my brother. At 140, my bf% was at 25%, and my bother told me that if I lost 10 lbs of pure fat, that at my goal of 130, my bf% would be at 19, which he says is not really healthy for a girl. I've also been getting a lot of comments from strangers and acquaintances lately (people who don't know I'm trying to lose weight) who tell me You look really fit! Which is new to me. I never used to get fit before. I hear time and time again from others, that I should stop losing weight when I am happy with how I look, but having eating disorders and the BDD, I don't think I'll even be happy with how I look 100% and part of that is due to me not really comprehending how I look. Sometimes I even get paranoid that people are telling me to stop losing weight because they know I have an ED and they are worried about me, even though I'm really doing fine. I feel like the people who love me, would rather me be chunky and healthy than skinny and sick, so I worry they lie to me. I'm sane enough to know though, that i'm most likely just being a paranoid idiot. 

To be honest, my original goal was to get slim and skinny. I wanted to feel delicate for once in my life, instead of this huge oaf-y girl that I always saw myself as. Now I'm beginning to see that my body doesn't really seem to go the delicate direction, even when I'm so much smaller. I feel like I have more dense muscle mass than a lot of the girls in my town. I'm willing to learn to be ok with this. I just wish someone could tell me objectively if I should still go for the last 8 lbs or not. 

I know the title of this is Knowing when to quit, but I just wanted to say that I plan to count calories the rest of my life and stay very active, so I;m not going to quit all together, but maybe I should quit trying to lose weight? Any incite would be greatly appreciated. Can I keep losing weight? Should I stop? Is there another way I'm not aware of for me to gauge my progress?

	<TEXT> Ok, so not many people seemed interested the last time I posted about this, but I figured I would show you guys my DIY project anyway, just because of the few people who expressed interest, and also, maybe if you see the finished product, you might be more interested. (It's basically a project to make a mannequin of yourself). 


My boyfriend jokingly referred to this as The vainest thing I have ever seen you do.  I'll admit, it feels pretty silly while you are doing it, but at the same time, I really thought it would help me out with my body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). As many of you already know, a few years ago I was diagnosed with BDD, anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder, the strongest and worst of which was the bulimia. Still, I haven't  relapsed into any of the ED behavior in well over two years, so the thing that I seem to struggle with the most now, is the BDD. Some days (more and more as I keep working on it) I feel fine and pretty and heck, sometimes, even slim. Still, some days feel like a nightmare. I don't let the BDD effect my life to the point where It really interferes with what I want to do that day, I refuse to stay home or hide when I'm having an attack, but I will feel shitty all day at work, and wear baggier clothes that I feel like I can hide in. Sometimes it's triggered by a bad picture that is taken of me. Sometimes it feels like nothing triggered it at all. At times I will be convinced that I'm still fat and that everyone is lying to me because they are scared I'll relapse. A lot of the panic I feel is due to me wanting to know what I really look like, because I feel like I look different in different mirrors and pictures. I felt if I could see myself the way I see other people, that maybe I could relax. 


Anyway, here's the tutorial I found. http://www.handimania.com/diy/your-own-shape-sewing-mannequin.html 


I basically followed this and then, afterward, I covered it in paper-mache and painted it. It actually has helped me a lot on days that I feel huge. I finished it around 2 weeks ago, and actually, it ended up being slightly bigger than I am because of the layers of tape, paper-mache, and clothes. I've lost a bit of weight since then also (maybe 2 lbs). My boyfriend joked with me and asked me Are you going to make another one when you get smaller? and I responded back No, I was beautiful then and I'm beautiful now. Right after I said it, a huge smile broke over my face. I have never once remembered thinking I was beautiful, just off the cuff like that. Sometimes in the past, Ive had fleeting feelings of beauty after convincing myself over a long period of time that I was ok. This really surprised me and made me happy. 


So yeah, anyway, here are some pictures of the process of making the mannequin. It's super weird having my own body on display in the corner of my room, and it feels very vain to have, but at the same time, it does help, and it was a very therapeutic and interesting experience.

	<TEXT> I went into Dillard's today (I work there) and told the sales girl "I want something short and tight." Something I NEVER would have dreamt of saying before. She pulled this out (On clearance for 8$). I immediately shook my head. Horizontal stripes are a no-no right? She practically forced it on me (I know her, we're friends, so it's ok) and I gotta say... Guess I can wear horizontal stripes now. And tight clothes. I feel like a million bucks. I really needed this today. Yesterday  I had a strong BDD attack and felt like utter garbage.

	<TEXT> I'm sure it's a bit of both for everyone, but I knew how to count calories since I was 10. Every bad food I put in my mouth, I more or less knew exactly what I was putting into my body, but I made the choice to do it anyway. 

When people find out you have lost weight, their first reaction is usually to say "Wow, how'd you do it?" Which I'm pretty sure most people already know how to lose weight and are just making polite conversation, or they are trying to find the "magic pill" I'm on. Still, there are some people that will almost bust out a note-pad and write down everything I say. I'll throw out blanked statements like "eat healthy, count calories, exercise" and, though it's rare, I'll have people ask "How can you tell what's good and bad for you?" I always just figured knowing that was second nature. 

A sweet lady I work with in her 50's wants to lose 30-40 lbs and asked me to show her how to do it. I actually had to teach her to read a nutrition label. She had never even flipped a box around and glanced at one in her life. No judgement or anything, I love helping people, but I was so surprised. So what about you?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have body dysmorphic disorder pretty bad. I feel like I look different in every picture and mirror. I must have thought to myself a thousand times "If I could just clone myself, and look at me like a different person looks at me, then I would know what I look like." Sounds crazy, but it's true. I wanted to see myself in 3D and tangible, from all angles. Pictures and mirrors can be effected by angles and camera types and such, but if I could clone myself, maybe I could feel better? 

Well today I found this

http://www.handimania.com/diy/your-own-shape-sewing-mannequin.html

And I did it, and I had fun, and when it was all over, I actually looked it over and felt a bit better about myself. Although I don't think my disease will ever go away, I think I'm going to keep this in my closet and look at it any time I start getting obsessively worried about what I really look like. It makes things a bit easier. Thought I would share.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few days I was at my parent's house, and ended up taking a picture of myself in their bathroom (A weird, vain habit of mine.) 

http://i.imgur.com/NfxpU85.jpg

Once I got home, I realized that it was taken in the same room as the last picture I had taken of myself before I was hospitalized due to my eating disorder. It really made me do some thinking about how sick and trapped I felt back then. How I felt like I was always going to be fat and hate myself. It made me realize how far I have come. That previous year I had lost 110 lbs in 8-9 months due to my eating disorder and the picture on the left was the last one I took before the hospital. 

When I got out of the hospital I gained back 95 of the 110 lbs I had lost because I was afraid I would relapse and die if I dieted. A little over 18 months ago, when I felt like I was strong enough, I started to try and lose weight again, this time the right way. I'm down to 138 lbs without relapse, and I'm happier and healthier than I have ever been. 

This holiday season, when food is all around, and you feel trapped, and maybe family is near and you feel stressed (Or heck, maybe you feel safer knowing they are close by) I encourage you to get help for your Eating Disorders if you have one. I encourage you to reach out to those around you with any issues who might need help, and I encourage those of you who have already sought help, to stay strong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been stuck at 140 lbs (5'5") for MONTHS. It's really frustrating. I've been exercising a lot in these past three months that I have been plateauing. 

I took pictures of me when I first hit 140, and now, three months later, still at 140, I figured I'd take more and put them up side-by-side and see if I could see a difference. I'm honestly not sure. Maybe a little. Or is this wishful thinking?

Hey guys, sorry for all the threads lately. I was just at the grocery store today, and as I was checking out, I looked around me at the other people buying different things. All the carts looked different. 

So it got me to wondering, what does your kitchen look like? Take some pictures of they inside of your fridge an pantry and show me! Maybe we all can discover some new and healthy food and/or snacks.

NOTE: I do not want this to be about judging people based off of what sort of food they eat. I think of this as something fun and possibly a way to discover some new foods.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't want to have this thread discourage people from losing weight. I think most of us agree that the benefits of weight loss greatly outweigh the negatives. Still, maybe we can share some experiences that others can relate to. We might also be able to have those losing weight, know about some things that they might encounter and maybe give advice on how to deal with it. 

Are you less sympathetic about certain things? Are you more sympathetic? Are you more judgmental? Are people mean to you now? Or are they nicer and you resent them because they were not when you were bigger? Have friends, family or SOs pulled away from you or act different around you? 

Do you have issues dealing with excess skin? Do you enjoy your favorite foods less, even if you have found a way to fit them into your calorie goal occasionally? Is it hard for you to enjoy a calorie heavy meal now? Do you experience more feeling of guilt now, when you have days where you did not meet your own expectations? Are you more self conscious?  Do you feel like you have become more shallow? Do others around you seem more shallow? Has your loss made your significant other nervous? Do people find you less funny? Do you feel like you can't say or behave in certain ways now, that you could when you were bigger? Do you feel like you talk about health and fitness too much and it's annoying people? Do other people talk to you about health and fitness too often now?

Really, anything you can think of that has changed in a way that you view as a negative? Everyone experiences weight loss a little different, and I'm curious about things you have noticed.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Body fat percentage with calipers while having excess skin. (picture) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-18 04:32:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my boyfriend bought me one of those electronic scales that measures your body fat. As much as I absolutely appreciated the gesture, I found that after a night of drinking, or after I took a shit, or you know, whatever effects my weight, but not my bf%, the reading on the scale was drastically different. I decided I wanted to get tested with calipers. I'm not sure I fully understand how calipers work, but I was pretty sure they measure the layer of fat in one's skin? 

I've lost 130 lbs and recently started weight training and I wanted to get an accurate reading so I know my starting point. I'm just not sure if my skin will give an accurate result. There still seems to be a bit of fat in my loose skin, so I'd imagine calipers would be fine, but like I said, I don't really know how they work and I've seen people with excess skin who had concerns with it's accuracy. 

Any insight would be appreciated. Here's a pic of my excess skin. The picture is a bit old, but that's still pretty much how I look.

	<TEXT> I've been so busy the past month, that my cardio has really suffered. I work at the Mall, so over the past 3 or so weeks, I've been speed walking around the mall on my hour-long lunch break. 

I've lost 130 lbs over the past 18 months. I am no stranger to exercise. While I wouldn't call myself "fit" I am pretty "active" and feel like I'm more fit than the average person. I own an elliptical and a stationary bike, and I can tare it up on both of those for well over an hour without issue.  

Every morning the day after I speed-walk, I feel like I got hit by a truck. The majority of my pain is in my hip sockets (not sure what they are really called). Why is such an unsatisfactory workout kicking my ass? I have wide hips and they tend to sway when I walk. Should I try and minimize that? What can I do to make it better? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My four year old daughter's daycare uses the "A Beka" curriculum. It's a pretty good one. It's the same curriculum I was taught when I went to private school in elementary. Still, it's a christian curriculum. When I brought this up, when looking at the school, the teacher told me "we don't do any of the religious stuff, we just use their learning techniques." I responded "Ok, I think I'm more comfortable with it like that." to which she replied "A lot of parents are." 

Today, my daughter was telling me about the prayer she learned at school before they eat. I was sort of surprised. Still, it doesn't really bother me. I always said as a parent, I would teach my kid how to think, not what to think. I think it would only bother me if they were devoting time to teaching her about christianity, because that time might be better spent teaching her scholastic things. 

I know atheist parents that completely shield their kids from religion. I tend to lean more towards the idea that exposing her to it and teaching her to think logically will make her better equipped when she enters the real world. Thoughts?   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First one. Went to Old Navy today. I'll be the first to admit, their sizes run big. I know that. I like shopping there because they sell a cut of pant that is for women with wide hips and a smaller waist. Anyway, I grabbed a size four of their skinny jeans, and a size two, just for shit's and giggles. I wanted to see how far I could get them up. Guys, they fit. I was floored. Considering when I started I was an Old Navy 22, this feels great. I went to a few other stores and every single thing I bought was a size small. Even in the junior's section. 

Second one. I've been CRAZY busy this week and I sometimes forgot to eat (bad I know!). At the end of the day, I've been finding myself with a lot of calories, and so I pretty much tell myself "You can have whatever you want. You have enough calories for anything." Well, every single time this week, I chose apples or salad or something very healthy to eat. I didn't pick those because I was counting calories. I could have anything I wanted. I CHOSE those things because I WANTED them. I felt like a normal person for once. 

Third. My dog is really fat and I decided this week that I was going to walk him every day. I walk on the sidewalk of a semi-busy street. I feel safer there than in an empty neighborhood. Anyway, it was pissing me off all week that people kept honking their horns at me. I figured maybe I wasn't supposed to walk on the sidewalk? Or my jogging form was bad? (I say jogging in that I can do it for about 3-4 min before I have to walk). Maybe I knew the person? Was I breaking some unknown pedestrian rule? It was irritating me all week and it happened at least once on every walk. Sometimes twice. Finally, today a guy in a truck peeped his horn at me and yelled out the window "Ow Ow! Sexy!". I was super surprised. Still, wish they would stop scaring the shit out of my dog. He's old. Still, feels nice to be noticed.  

I haven't lost weight in months, but I've been exercising like crazy. It's nice to have these NSV's when the scale wont move.

Does it mean more to you that her boobs look great out in public? Or how they look naked? If it were possible to have amazing looking boobs naked, but not in clothes, would you pick that over boobs that look good in public and strange in the bedroom? 

I ask because I've lost a ton of weight, and now I can go out in public, clothed, looking pretty ok. Naked, I actually have a lot of excess skin. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Random silly question from someone who thought she had weight loss "down". </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-03 02:30:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Many of you know me and know my story. I've maintained the past few months, ten pounds shy of my goal weight. I started graduate school, moved, enrolled my daughter in pre-kinder and started a new job (Now I have two!) yadda yadda, I decided to maintain for a while because I didn't think I could take the added stress/grumpy-ness of being at a caloric deficit. 

Well last week, I got really pumped up about re-dedicating my life to fittness. I decided that in a year I want to run a marathon. On top of that I decided to dedicate a lot more time to weight lifting. 

So here is the situation. Befor exercise, my body burns about 1700 calories a day. So far this week, I've been eating at 1,200. On top of that,  I burn about 500-700 calories a day/ five days a week doing cardio. I'm also on a 3-day-a-week weight lifting split that takes about 40 min a day to do. No idea how many calories that burns. 

As someone who has struggled with a plethora of eating disorders, I can tell you, this feels nothing like that. I'm being super healthy and I've packed up my scale for the month so that I'm not hyper-focused on the number. I'm also really happy with my life (despite being crazy busy).

So I know there is a lot of disagreement about this, but I always thought that as long as I am eating 1200 calories a day, I'm not eating too little. Also, when I have been in weight loss mode, I tend to shoot for -1,000 calories a day (Meaning, if i burn 1700 a day naturally, and then burn 500 running, than I can eat 1,200 calories and be at -1000) So, I'm eating 1200 calories a day, but if you factor in exercise, I'm netting around 700 calories a day. I'm shooting for a 2 pound loss a week.

My boyfriend tells me that when I was at 270 lbs, losing 2-3 lbs a week was fine, but at 5'5" and 140 lbs, it's too fast. I'm just wondering what you guys think? I'll admit, it's kicking my ass a little. I'm finding it harder to dig deep and push hard in exercises because im getting tired quicker. Still, I'm nowhere close to feeling like I did when I was being eaten alive by my eating disorders. 

EDIT: I am neither for or against the starvation mode theory. In all honesty I'm no expert, and I simply cannot form an opinion with which to sway someone for or against this line of thinking. All I know is that not eating under 1,200 calories a day serves as a sort of water-mark for me as a possible indication of eating-disordered behavior and thinking. Honestly, holding 1200 up as some sort of magic healthy number, seems silly to me, seeing as I know hundreds of people, all ranging from far lighter than me, to far heavier than me. It would seem to me having that much variation in size would dissuade from someone trying to standardize what the "right" amount of calories are for people as a whole. I'm pretty sure my 4'10" friend who is 95 lbs, would be able to eat a little under 1200 calories a day (seeing as her BMR is 1400) and I'm also pretty sure that my 6'6" 250 pound guy-friend would pass out only eating 1200 calories a day, because it's nearly 1700 calories under his BMR.  </TEXT>

My doctor took this picture of me. I'm sad to say that this was what I wore on any typical day. I hated the way I looked and always wondered why I should bother dressing up. T-shirts and sweat pants were "my look". 

Well, I'm 8 lbs away from my goal weight. Dillard's was having a mega sale. All the things that were on sale for 40-60% off were an additional 40% off that day. I also work there so I got a 25% off employee discount too. 

Here is the album of the new clothes I bought (I spent less than 200$ on everything that I'm wearing including shawls, panty-hose and shoes.)

I always wanted to dress like Zooey Deschanel. I know her dresses are prettier than mine, and she is most certainly skinnier than me, but for the first time ever, I left the house today feeling like a million bucks. (I also got a ton of skirts and shirts, but it's the dresses I'm most excited about.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Redditors who are married to someone who does not agree with them on having children, how is that working out for you? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-13 06:14:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm divorced and so is my boyfriend. I have a four year old daughter from my previous marriage. I have full custody and my boyfriend, my daughter, and I all live together. My boyfriend has a daughter also who is 6 from his previous marriage. She lives about 10 hours away and because he is in the army, he only gets to see her for two weeks at a time twice a year. He retires in 4 years and then we are all going to move to be in the same city as his daughter. 


My boyfriend is 35 and I am 25. I have my heart set on having at least one more child. My boyfriend is not so sure. He is always so upset at his inability to be the sort of dad he wants to be to his kid, that he is terrified to have another kid. He is also (as you can see) ten years older than me, so he worries that in five years, when I want my second child, that at 40, he will be too old to be a new dad. 


For us the conversation is still opened, but I am curious. Did any of you marry someone who did not agree with your desire for or against children? Did those who didn't want kids, but had them, resent the other partner? Did the partner who wanted kids, but never got them, resent the other partner for not having children? 


My boyfriend points out a lot, that It's not like I have no children. I still have my amazing daughter and he has his. Still, my desire to have another child in around five years is strong. The only thing that trumps it is my desire to marry him. He is the most amazing person I have ever met. I love him so much it hurts.
 

So yeah, any incite would be greatly appreciated.  


EDIT: I'd also like to add that he is AMAZING with my daughter. I literally could not think of someone who is a better father than my BF. My daughter calls him dad, and he loves her like his own daughter. Still, it feels like every time I see them playing, I drop an egg.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (NOTE: I realize this is going to come off as cheesy, but I wish I had been able to read something like this when I started my journey. )


I've seen it several time on here. People who lose the weight,only later to realize that even when they are no-longer overweight, that they are not happy. Many of us who have been overweight for the majority of our lives, sometimes feel like If I can just lose the weight, then I will really be happy only to find out later that they are not. I did it myself. In my own head, I think I traced nearly every negative thing in my life back to the fact that I was morbidly obese. I pinned the blame of all my failures and issues on my fat. Then, when I lost the majority of the weight (the first time) I realized that besides my pants size, nothing had changed. I still had so many issues that were making me depressed. I found that, no matter how much weight I lost, I still never lost myself. That was what was making me unhappy. Myself. I realized that I had to fix my insides before I could love my outsides. At that point in my life, losing weight began to feel like putting a new roof on a house that was rotting from the inside out. 


Many of us are heavy because we just really like cake. Others, are heavy because of other psychological issues.  Heck, at times it's a bit of both isn't it? For many of us, we can paint the outside of the house all we want, but we will never be happy living there until the termites inside are exterminated. I had to do a lot of personal work with a therapist after I was diagnosed with my eating disorder. Now here I am, years later, and 130 pounds down, and I realized that today, for one of the first times (that I was aware of) I was just brimming with happiness.  I felt like I looked good and that made me feel confident. Because I felt confident, I was brave about sharing my true self with new people because I have nothing, to fear, I'm pretty amazing. For the first time ever, I think if someone had told me they didn't like me, I would have chalked it up to their problem, not my problem. I can't remember ever just being so damn pleased with every aspect in my life. 


For once, I realize my boyfriend loves me because I'm pretty amazing, not because he just hasn't realized what a mess I am. For once, my daughter loves me because she has a great mom, and not because she doesn't know better. For once, I got the job because I am a very knowledgeable and capable person. For once, I'm taking the hard class because I know I am completely capable of handling it.  I'm worth it god dammit! AND YOU ARE WORTH IT TOO. YOU ARE NOT THE EXCEPTION! 


After reading so many stories through my journey, about people who lose the fat and are still not happy, please, let me tell you that happiness is attainable. There is a way to achieve it. Sure, life will still be hard at times, and you will still have obstacles, but if you believe that you are the capable person that I know you have inside, it will prevent you from crumbling under pressure and succumbing to the negative voice in your head. Losing the weight will not make you feel better. Finding the will to fight will. And once you find the fighter in you, it will permeate every aspect of your life. Because, you could do it. You could always do it.

	<TITLE> So, at risk of sounding like a scum-bag parent, at what age and/or size, should one worry about a child's weight? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-26 09:58:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My daughter is four. At what point does it become a good idea to be concerned with your child's weight? PLEASE don't get me wrong, I would never put a four your old on a diet, and my child is dead-center of a healthy BMI, but I'm curious, at what age should a parent switch from "My child has baby fat", to concern for the child's health?

My entire family is skinny. I'm the ONLY fat one, and that includes second cousins. There is no genetic issues linked to obesity in my family. My mom, I'm pretty sure, has an undiagnosed body image issue.  My whole life she was slim, but was constantly trying to drop "excess weight." (I think as an adult at 5'5" she never got lower than 120, so she isn't in danger, but she always acted/acts like she was/is fat.)

Knowing next to nothing about  actual obesity, my mother started me on a diet at a very young age. Her intentions were always good. She had no idea how it made me feel. I would almost venture to say that her putting me on a restrictive diet so young, made me feel like I had something to be embarrassed about, and thus, helped trigger a weird relationship with food. 

Now, I have a daughter of my own. I don't keep junk in the house, and I am very conscious of making sure she eats healthy. Still, there is so much mixed information. Some people tell me not to give her junk so she will be healthy, others say if I don't give her any junk at all, she will go crazy when she leaves the nest and only eat junk food. (I'm exaggerating, but you get the idea). It's such a balancing act and I'll admit, I am no expert and have been trying to play it by ear. 

On top of that, many kids go through pudgy phases and growth spurts. At what point do you get concerned about your child's size?  I would never want to give her a complex, but I also don't want her to go to High School obese, because I did, and I know how bad it hurts to hate one's body. 

So I'm not concerned right now, but I'd like to have these questions figured out, so I never need to worry about things like this in the future. 

Please please please, try to understand I'm not trying to be an insane mom who is only worried about her kid's physical appearance. I love her no matter what. I'm just trying to give her the best life possible.

	<TEXT> I know everyone is different, and only I can really say how strong my resolve is, but I have a question. 

I moved from the city I went to college in, back to the one I grew up in. I had gotten my Bachelor's degree and came back home to do my Master's at the college in my home town. After the first year of grad school, I will have a teaching certification. Still, right now I'm unemployed and the only jobs that are available in my home town are minimum wage crappy jobs. My boyfriend makes enough money to support my daughter and I, but barely, and I absolutely HATE being a burden on people. It makes me feel like a worthless POS. 

I've been job hunting, but the only job that seems to be hiring is in waitressing or fast food. No problem. I don't have a big ego. I'm totally fine with working a minimum wage job for a year. Still, I'm afraid being around all that unhealthy greasy food will be a death sentence to me. Those of you that know me, know I'm pretty much a vegan and that I have very strong willpower, but I don't know if I'm strong enough to be around food 24/7 without eating it. Any advice? Experience? Words of courage?

	<TEXT> One of the biggest things that I have tried to always be aware of was not becoming an arrogant person when I lost weight. I've seen several people do it, and it's a huge turn off. It is because of this, that I want you guys to tell me if I'm being an a-hole.

So I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this yet. A lot of my friends (More acquaintances that my very close friends) and co-workers are starting to take the stance that weight loss is easy for me. It reminds me of how, when I was really big, I would look at skinnier people and think "gosh, I wish I was born with their metabolism so I could eat all day and not get fat" instead of realizing that the majority of the skinnier people I knew ate really healthy or had a very strict workout schedule. 

When we're at lunch or hanging out people have started saying things to me like "I wish I could just drop weight like you, but it's not that easy for all of us!" Followed by a genuine good-hearted chuckle from the group. Or "Have you lost more weight? Man, it just melts right off you doesn't it?" Or even sometimes "I wish I had all that free time that you do to get healthy" after they just told me about how they marathoned 4 seasons of Lost last weekend.  

Most of these people knew me when I was 270 lbs. Still, now, there seems to be this general idea that my life is super easy. I work, am in graduate school, and a single mom. I make time to work out. I log every single calorie, even if I'm just grabbing two grapes from the fridge. I feel like every pound I have lost has been done by me chasing it, tackling it, and grabbing it by the throat until it stops moving. Every day I want to eat a block of cheese and watch tv all day, and every day I get up and make the hard choice to improve. 

Am I just being an a-hole? I laugh along with them and I try not to let it bother me, even though it's slowly getting under my skin. Maybe I just need to stop being a big baby. Have any of you experienced this?  Does it bother you? If not, is there a way for me to look at this in a way that wont upset me? I feel like if I said what I wrote here, that these people would think I was being an arrogant prick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read through the rules and I hope this thread doesn't violate any rules. If it does I'm sorry and you guys can remove it. 

I have noticed through my weight loss journey, that I get quite a few private messages and questions about loose skin. Most people are very apologetic for asking, yet at the same time, desperate to know what they are in for. I get it. Most of us who have lost a considerable amount, can be very touchy about our skin. I was wondering if maybe we could shed the stigma and try and open up a little bit about it. We could post our height, how much weight we lost, and our diet and exercise routines, and our ages. Maybe together we can find ways to combat or lessen the appearance of loose skin. 

Other people just starting out might be  able to see what   they are in for, or maybe choose a similar exercise and diet plan to the person they most want to resemble? I know everyone's body is different, but maybe we could shed some light on the whole thing and gain some insight? And heck, with the existence of this thread, maybe we will get a few less questions about our skin, and the people who want to know about it, can not feel so bad for asking. I don't know, what do you guys think? I in no way want this to be a discouragement for people who want to lose wight, I think talking about it would more than likely, convince people that it's not all that bad. 

Anyway, I'll be posting mine shortly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, I would like to say sorry for posting progress updates so often. When ever I hit a goal, I always just feel so excited that I want to share. Many of you have read my story before, so I'll keep it short-ish. 


I started at 270 lbs, I am now at 148. Only 18 more pounds to lose to get to goal. It's taken me more or less 14 months to go from 256 to 148, but my highest weight was 270. I did this through counting calories mostly, with the last 1/3 of the weight I added exercising. About 30-40 min of cardio a day, three days on, one day off. I'm adding a definitive weight lifting schedule starting tomorrow. 


I am finally in a healthy BMI range for the first time since I was in 2nd grade. I am 25 years old, and 5'5.

	<TEXT> Has anyone experienced a lack of interest in food after dieting for a long time? Don't get me wrong, I still eat healthy and I still enjoy my food, it's yummy, but it really brings none of the "Rush and thrill" it used to hold when I was bigger. I've been so busy lately that eating feels like more of a nuisance at this point. I'm not going to stop eating or anything (obviously) but the change in my attitude about food is really shocking to me. My entire world used to revolve around it and now (especially on days I am busy) I would almost rather eat one of those meal pills you see on "The Jetsons" than sit down to a plate of food.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Back strengthening exercises after a spinal injury? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-23 04:44:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was 16 I got thrown from a horse and fractured L1 and T12 in my back. I went to the ER, but I went home the next day. So it really wasn't all THAT serious, just very painful. They scheduled me for physical therapy, but my mom told me she didn't have time to drive me there every other day, so I never went. I was around 220 lbs at the time of the injury, so my weight wasn't doing me any favors. 

Fast forward to me at 270 lbs at age 22, and I was in constant pain. Doctors just told me to lose weight. Nobody ever re-examined my spine. 

Now I'm 25 and down to 155 lbs. I have 25 more to lose to get at goal. (I'm 5'5"). When I am eating at maintenance calories (Like when I'm taking a break from a deficit or on vacation or something) my back barely hurts at all. (It always hurts just a little bit though.) Every. Single. Time. I go into a caloric deficit though, it hurts just as bad as when I was at 270 lbs. 

I do cardio, but want to get into weight training for many reasons, but the number one reason is I'm hoping it can take my back pain away. I have access to hand weights in my house that range from 5lbs to 50 lbs. What exercises do you think would help? Any specifically that target the l1 and t12 area of the back? Do you think I should demand to be x-rayed again? Every time I tell a doctor about the pain they just seem to think it's normal and that back injuries are always going to hurt.  Why does the amount of calories I eat effect my back pain level?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let me start off by saying, this guy and I have been dating nearly a year and I am pretty sure I am going to marry him. Our relationship is amazing. The sex is amazing. My only issue? We only have sex about 3 times every 2 weeks. I know that is not infrequent by a long shot, but I am 25 and I ideally would like to have sex every other day. He is 35 and says he used to want sex all the time like me, but as he has gotten older the desire has gone down a bit. We have talked about it and he has told me he wishes he were horny more often. Is there anything we can do to naturally boost his sex drive?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So when my boyfriend and I met, we were both pretty big. I was bigger than he was though. He was about 230-240 lbs at 5'7 and I was 256 lbs at 5'5. He loved me instantly even though I was so big. We both shared a love of food and a desire to lose weight. Even though he is big, he has always been very fit. He is in the Army and has never failed a PT test and he is very muscular. One of the main reasons he wanted to lose weight was so that he could get promoted because at his current size, he can't pass the tape test and thus, cannot get promoted. 

Over the past 11 months we have been dating, I have gotten down to 168 lbs (My highest was 270) while he has remained roughly the same size. I love him exactly the way he is. I think he is very sexy. If it were up to me I would cook yummy meals for him all day long. Still, he wants to lose weight. He has days where he feels really shitty about the way he looks/feels, and expresses a desire to lose weight. He asks me to be supportive and encouraging and I try, but then when he has a bad day where he has cheated on his diet, he gets mad at me when I get on him and tells me to back off. 

We are otherwise very happy but I can't seem to get past this schism in his mind of wanting me to push him, and at the same time, to leave him alone about his eating habits. Any advice or tips? He has shown me pictures in the past of him losing large amounts of weight several times, but it seems to always slowly creep back on him. I just can't seem to get him really dialed in this time.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I said I would post again when I was no longer Obese. Well, here I am at 5'5", 178lbs! 

Mostly just eating less calories than I burn. I naturally eat low carb because i try to eat high protein and stay under my calorie limit. I count calories every day and try to stay 1,000 under so I lose two lbs a week. I don't really cut out anything. I just find that naturally healthy food keeps me fuller longer, but nothing as forbidden as long as I stay under my calorie limit. At the beginning the weight loss was a lot faster. Now it's much harder. 

When I first started my journey I was 270 lbs  and got to 160 through bulimia and dangerous eating habits. I was hospitalized and when I got out I stopped dieting and ballooned back up to 256. This time I was determined to do it the healthy way. The first pic is from me at 270 and the last was taken today at 178.

I don't exercise as much as I should. Maybe only 3-4 hours of cardio a week. I think in order to continue to lose weight I will need to push a lot harder!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now I'm a substitute teacher. I mostly do High school and middle school. Every so often elementary. Often times I come across exceptionally bright kids who, for the most part, are very socially awkward or outcasts. Today I taught 8th grade music and there was a cellist who was OUT OF THIS WORLD amazing. Talking with him I learned he is very bright and has a lot of great things to say. It broke my heart to see the other kids exclude him and make rude remarks at him. 

So Reddit, outcasts of the world, tell me: What can I say to these kids to give them hope?  </TEXT>
