	<TEXT> Unfortunately, the chances of you being a superhero are pretty slim.
There are roughly about 10 characters from Earth who have superpowers in the MCU. If we divide this by the population of the world (roughly 7.125 billion), your chance of being a superhero is an estimated 1.40350877e-7%, which is really low.

As a normal guy, you'll be facing a lot more danger than in the real world, especially with a world conquerer like Thanos who is to appear soon.

Gun crime in the US FAR exceeds gun crime in France, when proportionate to the population.

So yes, strict gun control laws are working in France. </TEXT>
