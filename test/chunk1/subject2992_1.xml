	<TEXT> Not a parent, but I was at the orthopedist waiting to get my foot checked out (in the waiting room), and there was a couple with an adorable daughter who was probably about 4 or 5 years old. There was a man on crutches walking out of one of the rooms, and he tripped over a chair that was sort of sticking out. Then the little girl shouts, "WHAT A DUMBASS!" She was grinning, and her parents were silently cracking up. The mom then shushed her and said, "Honey, where'd you hear that word?" And the little girl just kept on grinning. The guy on crutches luckily found it pretty funny.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once, I went on a field trip to Knott's Berry Farm in elementary school, and on the way back, we stopped at Hometown Buffet. I had the pleasure of watching some random kid puke up mashed potatoes and mac n cheese on the floor right by the entrance. I haven't been back to HTB since.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A friend of mine (M) used to sleep walk when he was around the age of 10-ish. Our families were in the Bahamas on vacation, and L (my friend, M's sister) and I were watching something in TV. They were in a pretty big suite at Atlantis, and all of a sudden, M calmly walks into the room (in his sleep), stops, and then starts screaming and running all over the room. Then he started banging on the doors and windows and walls saying, "WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE, THERE'S SHARKS! MOOOOM! MOOOOOOM!" And meanwhile, L, L's mom, and I are calmly following him everywhere he goes, very amused. He then suddenly stopped, stared into space, and then calmly got back in bed.

**TL;DR: Friend sleep-RAN all over the hotel room whilst going ballistic.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This one is my joke, but all my friends thought it was pretty funny. For an explanation, I've been wearing a walking boot for a few weeks because I hurt my foot from [aerial dance](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_dance): So, I sprained my foot doing aerial... But that's ok, she was worth it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> American here, in my senior year of high school. Everyone treats them as they treat everyone else. Last year, two of my friends (a lesbian couple) wound up winning homecoming queens (they got the most votes from the school out of all 4 grades). I'm secretary of my school's gay straight alliance and everyone totally supports it. My school is very supportive, even though I live in an area with the stereotype of bratty rich kids.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Zip lining. Those cables hold several hundred pounds of weight (if not a couple thousand). The carabiners are extremely strong and it's pretty damn difficult to unclip them. I guess maybe it depends *where* you're zip lining (I've only ever gone in Hawaii, and I'm not a professional, but I've learned quite a bit). This is just what I was told by the pros.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was 14. I was stressed, depressed, had terrible anxiety, was constantly getting into horrible verbal fights with my parents, was in a play at the time and was failing to memorize lines (and therefore letting down the rest of the cast), and just feeling absolutely worthless. 

And now? 17 and I'm actually pretty damn happy with my life, besides having some lingering problems with self harm and an eating disorder. But otherwise, great! A stay in the hospital for a week and antidepressants ad anti anxiety meds have certainly helped a lot.  </TEXT>
