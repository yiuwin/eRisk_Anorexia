	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been playing gw2 for a while now, and it clearly seems that i will probably never be able to craft a legendary. So i decided to lean my goal toward  less grindy cosmetic items, and managed to finish Mawdrey. Now, i need a new one to burn my time so any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.                            
Edit: totally butchered the grammar, forgive me </TEXT>

-A melee bruiser ice class that use ...well...ice to empower his/her attack
Passive: haven't come up with this yet                                       1st skill: regular melee auto attack, but every third strike you slow the enemy for x%                                                                       
2nd skill: release a cone of frost in front of you that damage the enemy and freeze ( or slow ) them, auto attacks on enemies affected by the effect deal extra damage                                       
3rd skill: create an ice shield around you that reduces damage taken for a small amount and damages enemies that attack you                    
Ultimate: You spin around ( whirlwind attack ) damage enemies around you and shoot out glacial lance at distant foes                                
Ps: this is just a fun idea that i want to share, nothing serious. So please, give me your opinion, i would love to hear them

	<TEXT> Pardon my Enlgishto.                                                                                                                           
Bought Gw2 about 2 years ago, and i love every aspect of the game, but it always seemed that the game failed to grab me, even though it's the only MMO i am willing to log in every update. And then i knew why, it's the lacking of social aspect. I live in Vietnam, not many people here play GW2, add up to that is my timezone. I couldn't join any guild because i would just end up logging in at 4am PST. I felt so disconnected, it was always just me running around maps, killing mobs, and it got boring in a while.                                                         
Then i started playing Path of Exile, there was a global chat with multiple channel, and it was 24/24 busy with people talking trash, asking question....I felt so involved into this lively world even though there was no one with me on the map ( literally, all the maps are instance except for cities )
And i wonder, why don't we add this to Guild Wars 2. Of course, problems there will be but i have confidence that Anet will be able to fix them with no effort.                                                                                    
Here are my fixes to the some of the problem                                                                                           
Gold selling : Guild Wars 2 is buy-to-play, so i think preventing this would be pretty easy                                
Chat Flooding : Dividing the global chat into channels, put a maximum amount of players on each one. Of course, like megaserver, priorities Friends, guildies..etc                                                                                        
I would LOVE to see your opinion on this </TEXT>
