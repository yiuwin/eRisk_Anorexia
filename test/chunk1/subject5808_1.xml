	<TEXT> Here's a hypothetical.

You are a country singer/songwriter, as a male or female you have a small but dedicated fanbase of about 300 people showing up to your shows all across the country.

You're approached after a gig by a manager who has a record A R exec. on his right. 

They go ahead to inform you they have some really solid pop songs that are pre written, ready for radio and they want your voice over them with your image and your music videos, but you need to change, you need to tone up, make up, change your style and alienate your fanbase.

Do you take this chance to potentially be a massive pop star or do you just keep going where you're going?

EDIT: I'm doing this to prove a point to some work colleagues </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Long-ish question and/or story.

I'm a musician and a sound engineer planning on having an extended trip to Canada in late 2015 or early 2016 for roughly two years and Toronto is the first on my list of places to visit. I intend on staying for around a year.

Having never been to Toronto, I was wondering about the best place to try and find an apartment where there is a hive of culture and music around me? And something that is also relatively well priced. 

Also, where do you guys go for independent bands? The best venues etc? I really want to meet as many people as I can and make some new friends. 

Thanks a lot!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have only known you about 6 years, but in that time, I've seen your career blossom as a musician.

You've gone from playing to 5 friends in a shitty bandroom to playing in front of 600 people in a sold out venue. Your songwriting, whilst it doesn't have the fire it used to, still appears to the masses and it's still catchy as hell.

You're a great dude, still taking the time to hang out after the show and give me a couple of your beers, it shames me to not be able to offer anything of mine except for love and support.

I hope we can be friends for years to come, but as more people come into your life, I hope I'm not cast aside as just another member of the masses.

I'm happy for you, I just don't want to lose you as a friend.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm coming over to NYC at the end of 2015 (Still a long way off) but I'm looking to get involved with the music scene before I come and to check out some bands and make some friends before I come over. 

I'm coming from Australia so I was also hoping to find one or two bands to sponsor an entertainment visa for me as well so I can stay for a couple of years.

I've been doing sound engineering in Melbourne now for about 7 years and really want to get involved in the Music Scene in the USA, particularly the North Eastern Region. I've heard really great things. 

So, who are you guys? What bands are you in? Where do you play? Are you on Facebook or Soundcloud?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today in the Melbourne Cup, an annual horse race in Australia. People got drunk, bet on races and in the main event, the favourite horse collapsed to the back of the group and died in the stables. There was also another horse who was scared by the audience and broke it's leg and will probably not survive the night. 

I am deeply and emotionally moved by this, it's called sport and I really don't understand how people can condone animal death like this...

It's like we're all supposed to turn a blind eye, put the blinkers on, but I just can't. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Guys, I'm getting myself an Epiphone Custom ES339 in the coming weeks and it's the first semi hollowbody I've ever owned. I'm going to be using this guitar primarily for folk and blues and I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions for a moderate 40 odd watt amplifier to go with it?

I currently have a Fender Frontman 212R but it's just a bit too touchy on the lower volumes and I don't mind having a smaller combo because of the type of music I'm moving into.

I don't mind going into stores and trying different amps either, so multiple suggestions can be encouraged. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Guys and Gals,

So I've been reading the Age website recently, and while for the most part it's informative, it's starting to really piss me off at the same time.

I was just on the front page scanning for an article relating to the recent disaster in the Himalayas, but there is nothing there, not even in the world section!

2 Articles about Ebola, but nothing about 40+ people dying in a trekking disaster.

So, I was wondering where all of you turn for your news on a daily basis? Maybe I can find something better.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your input! Loving the suggestions!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> G'day everyone,

I'm in a 3 piece punk band from Melbourne and we're coming up to Northern Queensland for a four date tour in May 2015. I'm looking for some advice on the best places to hit or venues to play while we're up there.

We're looking to start in Rockhampton, go to Airlie Beach, then Townsville followed by Cairns as the last stop.

If time permits, we'll probably be dropping into Mackay on the way up as well. 

If anyone is from this area, can you recommend any venues that might suit us? We sing mostly about drinking booze and partying.

Cheers and Beers </TEXT>

And then you changed me, I stopped caring about looking good because you loved me for who I was and not what I looked like. I put all that weight back on because of you and your love for takeaway.

I quit exercising and got unfit again.
