	<TEXT> I tried that when I was  a teenager to some one who was a little different, He had a lisp and a snotty nose. I did befriend him and I was just being kind like I would to any one else, but hen the guy got all weird and started to hangout in my basement. I had to tell him that "Hey that I did not want to be that kind of friend. I just wanted to say hey. You want to be friendly, but sometimes , it's just taken the wrong way and they get hurt anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should make it clear that you have seen more "pictures" of naked ladies. I am sure the Romans saw their fair share of "live" naked ladies. In some African tribes today there would be many men that have seen more "live" naked ladies than you have on the internet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think there is some truth that it can actually induce/aggravate panic disorder and magnify anxiety. I friend of mine has this problem when he tokes. Also my son years ago tried it at a dance years ago and he was in a big panic. He called me to take him home. I did not know what was going on. He did eventually tell me that he smoke some weed, for the first time and was very paranoid and panicky. I talked him into going for a walk until it started to wear off telling him that some people just can't handle it and he seemed fine with that. He manged to get his shit together and I drove him back to the dance. We have never talked about that night since then and to this day he realizes that he cannot smoke pot without having these awful feelings. I was so glad that he felt comfortable letting me in his life at the time he needed someone. I did not lecture him or punish his behaviour in any way. He was a young teenager and I was one also. Yes I think that pot can have this effect on some people. </TEXT>
