	<TEXT> Well, the minimum order at Signature plastics is $100, but a one off set is $700+ without novelties ($50 each), so a single set would defiantly meet MOQ but I would need to have enough interest in alps for me to do it. The only reason this wouldn't happen is if the price is too high for the customers to pay (such as $200+). But other than that, I'm down to do alps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I see where your coming from.
The reason for this separation is because I am getting a lot of interest for the black alpha with mint mods over at geekhack.

I have a few ideas on seperation and child deals so I will be working on that today :) </TEXT>

The all green set and the brown function keys were all user requested renders and I didn't have many intentions of including them in the main set.

So the sets in the main post should get turned into a group buy after I receive quotes from Signature Plastics.

	<TITLE> First Lucid dream :) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-01 01:46:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here is my dream journey entry for tonight when I had my first LD:

Dream/Sleep Journal:
30 June - 1st July:
Went to sleep/bed at around 10:30, got up at about 6:10 to go toilet and get a drink and couldn't get back to sleep until I would say around 7:00. After that I slept and got woken up by Ben complaining that he didn't want to get up after dad telling him to wake up at around 8:06. After that I just lay down and tried to sleep. I fell asleep a couple of times and only got 1-3 minutes sleep from each, every time I woke up it was because of Ben and Sarah turning on the light and yelling at each other. Then after they left to eat breakfast/get ready, I fell asleep and started dreaming. This is how my dream went. I fell asleep in real life and woke up as my "Dream self" in bed. In my bed their was my iPad, which was on the charger in real life which told me something wasn't normal, so I did some quick reality checks (pushing middle and fore finger through my hand, breathing through my nose with my fingers blocking it and turning on/off the light switches (Just to see what happens(sometimes it worked others it would just stay in its original state)) then I realised that I was dreaming and just said "Wow, I guess I'm having a lucid dream right now". After that I spun around to change the setting and thought to myself "I want to go to school", so I spun around a couple of times and was at my school. At school a bunch people were having high and long jump competitions so I decided to have a go at both events, and it was INCREDIBLE. In long jump I got the furthest distance (can't remember the distance (oh well)) and in high jump, I passed over every single stage (height) and at the end I just ran across the basketball court and jumped SOOO high (and started to fly a little bit) and then when I came down people asked how I did it so I explained that I was Lucid dream and said that it meant that I was a wear that I am dreaming and can control almost all factors of the dream and showed them that I can stuck my fingers through my palm, they just said "ok" and walked of as if nothing just happened. Then I looked in my pocket and found a vape (e-cig) for some random reason and then just wondered around looking for my friends. After a while I got bored and spun around and said "I wanted to go and see my mums family" (as my grandma was a scientist and she might know something about it) and I spun around and went to what seemed to be their house but somehow located in Mexico. At "Mexico" everyone their was eating tacos and chilli (yum) and after a while eating I said to everyone that I was lucid dreaming and I started to make things around me float in air (Pie tins etc...) they had no idea what was going on and my mum (who is HEAVILY religious) said that I stole her brothers wedding cake (he's never been married before) when I was little and that I was "Possessed by the devil" (or something along those lines) and I just walked around. After walking around the unfamiliar house for a bit I found a gaming PC at the front door and decided to plug it in. After booting to Windows I went to google and remembered that I was still dreaming and that I had to wake up to do guitar practice this morning I tried to type up "How to wake up from a lucid dream" in Google (I hadn't searched this in real life) and it would come up with Arabic (or similar language) text. After trying SO many times I just gave up and spun around to go home. When I got home I lay down in bed and after a short while I was awake in my real life bed. The dream felt like atleast an hour (more likely 3-4) but it turned out to be only around 10-40 mins in real life. After waking up I searched up how to summon things in a lucid dream and will try it tonight/whenever I have another LD.

-Joshua

EDIT: The names "Ben" and "Sarah" are my little brother and sister </TEXT>
