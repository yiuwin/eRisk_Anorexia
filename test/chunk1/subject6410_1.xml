	<TITLE> Thoughts about having Dromund Kaas feature in an upcoming movie? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-15 06:06:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'd like to think that with each new Star Wars film will come a new planet with a surface that varies differently with those of previous movies.

For example, we have seen desert, snow, woodland, water/grassland, sky, city and  volcano planets in previous movies.

In any of the new movies, i'd like to see some unique planets feature. And i think that a planet such as Dromund Kaas would fit perfectly.

It has swamps, heavy jungle, heavy rain and is very dark. Its the perfect setting for an evil character(s) to reside in. Not to mention all the sith temples and buildings that can be used to develop story lines. What are your thoughts? would you agree that Dromund Kaas would fit nicely in a Star Wars film?  </TEXT>

My theory is that they *did* survive past the battle of Endor, join Luke's academy and then get killed when Luke's academy "fails"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> May i add to this interesting point...

We all know Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Yoda came back in ghost form.

We also know that Anakin came back in ghost form.

How do we know that these ghosts do not appear in EP VII? or do they all mysteriously vanish like Obi-Wan did in the (now legends) Heir to the Empire story...


I dont think all these ghosts could simply vanish. At least one of them should remain in TFA. Perhaps Anakin's ghost goes around telling people he is "redeemed" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the concept of "ancient civilisations" in Star Wars so im gonna have to say i'd like to see any of the following: 

Korriban (valley of the sith lords)
Dromund Kaas (citadel)
Ruusan (Valley of the Jedi)
Yavin 4 (Massassi temples)

I think Dromund Kaas would be especially cool. It would be like Dagobah but with sith buildings everywhere and all sorts of lost bad guys hiding there. But alas, from the footage we have seen to date, it doesnt look like we are going to see any of the planets i mentioned above.

Also, ive got high hopes for this so called [TFA potential spoiler](/s "Jedi Monastery that Luke is supposedly hiding in. I think this is as close as we are gonna get to an ancient jedi civilisation setting in TFA ")

	<TEXT> Using both dark/light powers doesnt necessarily make you a grey jedi. I think he is best categorised as an unofficial apprentice of the Sith Order first and after just a force-user with a lightsaber after.

	<TEXT> "And now, farewell. I loved you as a son, and as a student, and as a friend. Until we meet again, may the Force be with you."

Many of us will remember that moment in Heir to the Empire when Obi-Wan visited Luke for the last time and gave his final farewell. 

Well, since that never happened anymore. What are your ideas about the future of Ob-Wan's spirit post ROTJ? will he continue instructing Luke? or will he disappear in a similar fashion at some point like in HTTE.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yes the "lets look after Leia coz obi-wan is looking after luke" thing. Dont like that idea to be honest.

If Ahsoka was to survive past ANH, then really speaking She, along with Yoda, Obi-Wan, Kanan (and probably other yet-to-be-revealed limited edition rarest master pepe from Yavin 4) could easily take on Vader and Palpatine surely? </TEXT>

Should she survive right through to episode 7?

	<TEXT> 

In informal speech, in what contexts would one use the above words? are there any differences in meaning? or do they all mean the same sort of thing.

I ask this because many singers of Eipirotika tragoudia include the world "ore" or "more" in their lyrics and im interested to know what exact meanings they have.

thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what ive read, Qui Gon is considered a "grey jedi" (even though he doesnt look like one to me). I guess that means he is susceptible to influence from the dark side some what.
So if Anakin still gets a little naughty and does some un-jedi-like things, Qui-Gon would still support him because he sees his potential and sees him as the Chosen One.

If i was tasked with re-writing episodes 2   3 with Qui-Gon surviving, i guess i would make it work like this

* Qui-Qon takes Anakin as his apprentice. Ob-Wan is promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight and leaves Qui-Gon.
* Anakin does some naughty things. He ends up back on tatooine and saves his mum from the tuskens (by killing their whole tribe)
* Anakin goes to some gray Jedi that Qui-Gon secretly knows so they can try and heal Shmi. They begin the process of force healing
* Obi-Wan has secretly followed them to try and stop them from "giving into emotions" or "not following the jedi code" or something along those lines.
* Qui-Gon, Anakin and Obi-Wan duel, Qui-Gon dies. Anakin goes crazy
* The Gray Jedi who were healing Shmi escape.  Anakin continues to duel Obi-Wan but is overwhelmed and decides to escape with his mum.
* Shmi tries to compel him to calm down and control his emotions but he cant get over the fact that Obi Wan killed his old master. 
* Anakin leaves the Jedi Order and tries to find other ways to heal Shmi. Which then eventually leads him to Dooku. Dooku is then not so impressed that the Jedi killed his old apprentice so he sheds any form of doubt he once had and continues his path to the dark side. Taking Anakin as his apprentice.
* Dooku however is not a very loyal sith. With his new found apprentice, he decides to plot against Darth Sidious.


Just my few ideas. Not sure how well they would translate onto film. but thats what i'd think would happen if Qui-Gon survived. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do the new canon books based in the post ROTJ period compare to the legends storyline? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For those of you who have read Aftermath, Lost Stars and Shattered Empire, how would you compare the new story line with the legends post-ROTJ story line thus far?

I grew up with (and thoroughly enjoyed) the universe expanded upon by Zahn and Anderson and want to start on the new canon but i've heard mixed reviews about the new books/comics. 

So i guess my main question is, are these new books anything like the legends books? should i read them or should i wait till more "important" books get written?

	<TEXT> Agreed. Would like to see at least one rhodian or gran. maybe even a Chiss.

But then again, the galaxy is a big place.. if Mos Eisely Cantina alone could bring together so many aliens like rhodians, weequays, Bith etc etc i guess Jakku could bring together aliens from a different part of the universe. Hopefully these new aliens add to the richness of the star wars universe

EDIT: Also, lets hope some alien races like the "Lepi" never make it out of EU into Canon.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is my first post to reddit so my apologies if i've got this all wrong.

I recently learned that the planet Nar Shaddaa has been taken from the "legends" storyline and included in the official canon via the mobile game "Star Wars: Commander". Im curious to know now, are there any other planets/characters/vehicles/lore or other major elements of the "legends" storyline now been included in canon?

Edit 1: April 25 is when the EU was re-branded as the non-canon Legends storyline 

Edit 2:
Thus far i have found the following have been taken from EU:

* The planet Nar Shaddaa
* the Massassi race 
* The planet Ylesia
* The planet Zolan
* HWK-290 light freighter
* The planet Vendaxa
* The planet Iridonia
* The planet Carida (first appeared in the clone wars but is a major element in the EU so included here)
* The planet Taanab
* The planet Chandrila 
* The planet Eriadu
* The planet Corulag
* Chiss
* Screed (imperial officer) '
* Malla(tobuck) Chewbacca's wife

Further edits based on commenter's responses:

* Base Delta Zero
* The planet Taris
* Kyber Crystals
* The Hundred Year Darkness (An ancient Jedi civil war)
* Pazaak (game)
* Delta squad
* Lord Tion
* AT-MP 
* VT-49 </TEXT>
