	<TEXT> I didn't even know a Frankenstein plot was part of the show.

It was a nice surprise. Nice acting from both actors (Victor Frankenstein, and The "Monster"). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good pilot episode. 

It ends leaving us with many questions:

How did Murray's daughter become a vampire?

Was Vanessa the girl from the beginning of the episode? What exactly is she, a witch, or just "sensitive"?

Who exactly is Chandler? What's his backstory?

And will Dr. Frankenstein's monster follow the violent ways of his literary counterpart?

~~All these and more on the next episode of DragonBallZ!~~

As Chandler said is a rule in show business, "keep them wanting more".

I'm curious to what happens next! </TEXT>

It just...looked like a soap opera. It didn't really capture the essence of the show.

	<TEXT> "An interior view of the Apollo 13 Lunar Module (LM) during the trouble-plagued journey back to Earth. This photograph shows some of the temporary hose connections and apparatus which were necessary when the three Apollo astronauts moved from the Command Module (CM) to use the LM as a "lifeboat". Astronaut John L. Swigert Jr., command module pilot, is on the right. An unseen Lovell on the left holds in his right hand the feed water bag from the Portable Life Support System (PLSS). It is connected to a hose (center) from the Lunar Topographic (Hycon) Camera. In the background is the "mail box," a jury-rigged arrangement which the crew men built to use the CM lithium hydroxide canisters to scrub CO2 from the spacecraft's atmosphere. Since there was a limited amount of lithium hydroxide in the LM, this arrangement was rigged up to utilize the canisters from the CM. The "mail box" was designed and tested on the ground at the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) before it was suggested to the Apollo 13 astronauts. An explosion of an oxygen tank in the Service Module (SM) caused the cancellation of the scheduled moon landing, and made the return home a hazardous journey for astronauts Swigert, James A. Lovell Jr., commander, and Fred W. Haise Jr., lunar module pilot."

Remember earlier in the season, when the drugs ran out, and they had a "townhall" meeting?

Well those were his henchmen/associates. 

They aren't people he trusts, be still, they'll do what he says (for the most part).

The few people he does trust are Carl and Jimmy. I guess those two are his "inner circle". </TEXT>

Langham doesn't have any actual culpability, but I think he may be interested in getting involved with the kid. IDK, we'll see.

Jane: Have you ever read on universal tendency toward debasement in the sphere of love?

Austin: Is that like Ode on a Grecian Urn?

Austin: I have no clue what you're talking about.

Shrink: I think you do.

Austin: No, I really don't!

Shrink: I think you do.

(Austin looks very concerned)

*"My mom has nothing to do with my penis"*

If they made a comedy show just on Austin, I'd watch it.

This was a fantastic, funny episode overall. Even Bill had funny lines. *"It's uncanny, they're like lions!"* At the end, I thought he'd be a prick and fire her again, but he promoted her. 

We did miss Ethan though. Hope to see him next episode. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It seems this book focuses more on the latter?

Yeah. Honestly, a very large part of the book deals with how the SIS was structured, and how it operated in the UK bureaucracy (all of this, pre WW2).

I bought the book a while ago (can't return it now!), but if I had a choice between this book, and a book that dealt with the SOE, I'd choose the latter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have this book: http://www.amazon.com/Mi6-History-Intelligence-Service-1909-1949/dp/1408810050

It covers the SIS from WW1 till the end of WW2.

I think this might benefit you. 

 espionage and code-breaking, but also about the actions taken to place false information, like turning German spies and especially the wrong clues planted to disguise the real place of landing for the invasion of Normandy.

Yes this book has all that stuff. Plus *some* stuff on the British SOE.

I should warn you though, it isn't James Bond, and it isn't a novel. It's a history book, and as such, (honestly) it can get a bit boring at times.

If you're looking for exciting commando operations, and things like that, better look for a book on the SOE. This book only touches on that stuff.

If you're looking for stuff on agent recruitment, and how the SIS was established and operated, then get this book. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Kensi-Deeks situation was done very well.

Right when you think he doesn't want her, he pulls the "You were my safe place" line.

Great acting, writing, and direction all around. A nice premiere episode.

Though keeping Janviere alive was a bit cliche; I hoped they would've finished that plotline.

Vaziri and his mates got their comeuppance in style, though.

(Not to nitpick, but this episode was "Ascension", the last episode was "Descent": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ncis_la_episodes#Season_5:_2013) </TEXT>

"dreamland" - 2 part episodes, where Mulder and an Area 51 G_Man switch bodies

"how the ghosts stole christmas" - One of the funnier episodes

---You know what, **fuck it dude! Watch all the MOTW episodes**. They're all quality!

The Myth episodes are weak, but every single MOTW episode is good!

Watch them all! Season 6 is great!

	<TEXT> Fuck man, as I read this thread I'm being reminded of all the terrible episodes I forgot about.

This was the last MOTW episode of the series. Such a disappointing one at that.

What on earth were the producers thinking? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting. Seems you and I are a bit different.

I liked the MOTW episodes that dealt with freaks/mutants/monsters.

The truly terrifying episodes for me were the earlier, supernatural ones. The ones that dealt with demons, the devil (and I'm not even a religious person).

The episodes that dealt with children and the supernatural were especially frighting (ex: The Calausari). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really have one specific least favorite episode per se, but the later Mythology episodes just became terrible.

Some shit about super soldiers, and Sculley's baby, and a new Syndicate, and that guy from Firefly, etc...?

I don't fully remember the plotlines anymore. (Maybe that's for the better)

Some of the later MOTW episodes (season 9) weren't so great either. It seemed like the show wasn't taking things seriously anymore. Granted, I like the funny episodes in the earlier seasons, but it seemed like the episodes were being phoned in (ex: the genie episode, and the Burt Reynolds episode).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still love the show.

Yes, it's changed drastically (S1 and S2 had that small town charm), but if the show never changed, people would be bitching about that.

They took some risks. Some worked, others failed (ex:the Authority plot from last season).

I like the show for the same reasons you stated.

Its just a wacky, crazy show (that can still show a lot of heart).

This season has improved a lot since last year, and I look forward to season 7. </TEXT>
