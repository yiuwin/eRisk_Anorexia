	<TEXT> One good tip I found is when you have something to add to the conversation topic go ahead and say it. Don't hesitate. The moment you start questioning whether or not what you have to say is worthy it will be to late and the topic will change. Trust me people will appreciate your input and it's better to say something than to sit there not saying anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try to isolate the problem to it either being the game itself or R*'s servers. Turn off/disconnect the internet and see if you can play in offline mode. The infinite load time is probably (my best guess) because of all the people trying to play. Hope that helps a bit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But the problem with these things is that console gamers will keep believing that you atleast need a 1300 pc to play most games. While this certainly isnt true, its because these bullshit videos they think that. 

I am so glad you said that. That's the sole reason my friends won't ascend. </TEXT>
