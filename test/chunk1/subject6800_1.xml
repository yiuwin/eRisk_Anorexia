	<TEXT> Always interesting when things like this happen... Here's what I've noticed on coinmarketcap.com

1. Price chart says 300% increase, witha  price of $.028 ( when it was $.0008), so a 340% increase makes sense.  HOWEVER the poloniex XRP/USDT still shows the original .0008
2. The Market capitalization on CMC jumped from 200m to 1 Billion. Talk about money injection. 
3. In terms of volume and liquidity, Ripple Gateways XRP/USD has 4.8m VOL and only 1.5M on POLO XRP/BTC, when usually POLO is leading the pack. 

Time should tell shortly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can Elon quantify the probability of the "unlikely" sabotage? is it actually unlikely or is he just saying that to avoid his future rockets from being blown up? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tips: 
1. You have to apply online now
2. You pretty much need full availability  or your not getting on.(you definitely won't get weekends off.)
3. Your going to be working the tills packing them or pushing buggies so don't hope for something overly fun. (Apply for front end)
4. They will likely hire in October and then your laid off Jan 1 until may. So you will only get half the months til school.

Good luck. ( I work at a surrounding one) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kim mentioned it could be used as a white label, so I'd think anyone could recreate sites using the same underlying bitcache system quite easy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I enjoyed it even though it wasn't perfect because it had a catchy beat and a strong meaning. The message delivery reminded me of the likes of Immortal Technique. I'll take spitting the truth anytime over rapping about drugs and iPhones.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simply put, you don't need to be a good mechanic to be a good driver. As Bitcoin grows, the industry needs to market the adoption to drivers in terms they understand. Almost everyone drives, and many are uninterested in what's under the hood, in this case the blockchain. They just want to get from A-B as fast and cheap as possible. </TEXT>
