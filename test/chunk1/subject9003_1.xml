	<TEXT> **BRENDAN IF YOU ARE READING THIS GO AWAY**      kthxby   

So my brother has a little kitten, maybe 6 months old. I want to get him something that fun. Some info that might be helpful

* The cat is awesome. 
       * for one it's got MAD hops
       *  he loves EVERYONE. If a murderer pointed a gun at it, the cat would purr and get cozy with the murderer.
  *  His name is kit-kat
 * My brother is training the cat to be a killer. (killing mice, birds, and bears. The works)


* My brother is living in a small apartment

* It needs to fit in my suitcase. I'm flying out to my family (I live on the other side of the country).

That's all thanks for any help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The default position would be no position at all. For your argument to hold we would need to be in a perpetual state of believing or not in a given entity. If you just look around you will see it does not hold. 

If there is a red rabbit in the world but one does not know of it, you could could ask one "is there a red rabbit?". The appropriate answer would be "I do not know". If one were asked "have you seen a red rabbit?". This question could warrant the answer "no" because one is speaking relative to oneself.  So you can say atheism is the default position relative to oneself, but we can not speak in relative terms to say atheism is the default position. But it raises the question, what is the value in being an atheist relative to oneself? It appears to be a shallow statement. Being an atheist relative to oneself would be confirming what you have not experienced. Using it in argument would be an anecdotal fallacy. 


This is kinda unrelated but, why did I get down voted? I am not trying to attack anyone's belief or what not. If it is as I assume, people are upset because I am saying things that conflict with what they believe. This confuses me. Atheists like to attack the dogma of the church yet they so clearly extrude dogma themselves. In this case it is best to lead by example.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You still need to have faith to call yourself an atheist. Atheists have faith that something does not exist. You can not know of atheism because there is no criteria for their statements. You can throw science up as your defense but science doesn't deal with metaphysical issues. 

Atheism does require belief, but it does differ from theism in the focus (disproving/proving) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This issue has been persisting for about 10 months now. The issue is that my artists and albums aren't indexed properly. In some places artists aren't in alphabetical order and most of the time artists appear under the wrong letter. **N**irvana will show up under the **"O"** or The **S**hins show up under the **"U"**. Basically the letter indexes are further up the list than they should be. 


This doesn't bother me too much but what drives me up the wall is some labels. Instead of showing the artist name or ablum it shows me the COMPOSER/PRODUCER. I don't know my producers well enough to navigate my library.

Any helps would be awesome! Thanks for reading. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a little late but here is what I do:
Preheat the oven to 375*F.

Cut an "x" into the sweet potato about half way through.

Rub your favorite spice blend (my recommendations are below) and vanilla extract around the "x".

Wrap in tin foil and set it in the hot box for about fifty minutes. You will know when the skin peels away easily from the sweet potato. 

For spice blends I recommend you make yours from scratch by putting the whole spices in a coffee grinder. It really elevates the flavor, aroma, and you can make a weeks worth at a time.

My go to spice blend has got to be. Cloves and Cinnamon. About a stick of cinnamon to a small handfull of cloves. In pre-ground dry form, 1:1.5 cinnamon:cloves.

For a liquorish flavor I do a variation on Chinese five spice. White pepper corn, Chinese cinnamon (regular cinnamon will do), cloves, and Jamaican all spice.

Between the baking of the sweet potatoes and the grinding of spices will produce an unforgettable aroma  </TEXT>

I went back to NY a few weeks ago and it things are looking better, but for some reason the 14-16 year old kids are doing heroin. 

I must admit I am only 18. It's funny though when I was 14 I wouldn't think much of my friends free basing every other pill that came there way. Now I would be horrified to see a kid that age strung out. Though I am happy that I have stayed away from anything but pot. To this day the only drug I've touched is Ritalin </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just go cold turkey. If you can make it through the first month you won't have any issues later down the line. You said you don't like the idea of eating flesh, GOOD now exploit that. As someone else said, rip the band-aid off. You just need to drill it into your head that you are not going to eat meat.

Once you take the plunge you should spend the first two weeks eating whole foods (fruit, veggies, eggs, milk, rice, nuts and nut butters, oils. NOT bread, meat substitutes, frozen dinners, etc.). I think of it as a pseudo-cleanse. It really helps drill in the idea that you are not eating another animal's flesh. 

For the next 4-6 weeks avoid eating food that reminds you of meat and explore vegetarian cuisine. If you like grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, than stay away from from cheese sandwiches. **Do not touch veggie burgers, veggie dogs, or anything intended to replicate the flavors and textures of meat.** These products really do suck relative to meat. They will just remind you of how good meat *'tasted back in the good ol' days.'*

On the note of exploring vegetarian cuisine, don't be afraid of tofu! Tofu is not just meat substitute, it is a dominate part of eastern cuisine. [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu#Three_theories_of_origin) would convince you if you are skeptical. If you like asian food in general, exploring vegetarian cuisine can be fun!

About 2 months after you take the plunge you will be in the clear. You will be less likely to indulge in your meat cravings. You will find the only issue that will persist are social issues. 

I can't tell you what to do, but just avoid arguments around vegetarianism. You may be doing something good, but it does not give you the right to make other people feel bad for there dietary choices. If someone wants to have an honest debate about vegetarian, then you owe it to them to listen to them and reply with honest answers. And remember, you can always just say "I can't fathom the idea of eating meat. Just personal taste" and leave it at that. A lot of people who pick on you for being a vegetarian are just intellectual bullies. They will quickly grow bored of you if you don't engage with them.

I hope this helps and good luck in your future endeavors, vegetarian or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My french teacher was telling me about that. I had been to DC numerous times when I was younger, but I was far from an adventurous eater. I had my first experience with Ethiopian food last fall. It was pretty good, but the flavors were a little dull. I hear most Ethiopian restaurants tone down the flavors for the American pallet. 

It's interesting that most cultures do this when serving there food abroad. I recently went to Tokyo and had the best food of my life! The flavors were so new to me. I knew that Japanese food was more than crappy sushi and hibachi made by Koreans, but the pallet is almost transcendent. I want to have an experience like that with Ethiopian food (as well as southern Indian food). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "I see what you did there." would imply there is a hidden message in his post. In most contexts it is humorous.

I do not see a hidden message or anything humorous as *hammertheisland* is stating how thermodynamic mechanics work. Am I missing something? or do you not understand the statement? 

I could see how you would assume there is more depth to *hammertheisland*'s statement as, in language, he refers to the opposite and sites it as a truth.

Could you help me understand what you mean by "I see what you did there"? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can someone explain the conflict between Israel and Palestine? I remember going over it in High School world history briefly. From my memory the Jews (I am in now way being derogatory) wanted there own nation. I forget the majority of the details because we spent only ONE DAY on it. After watching [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/23060188@N04/7362387428/in/photostream/) video. It made me curious.

My question is the what, when, how, and why regarding the conflict between Israel and Palestine. I have a second smaller question (which is seen in the title) that is, how is Iran involved in this?

Thanks for your time, I really wanted to be educated on this topic, as it is a large talking point in foreign affairs these days </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those of you who aren't big hikers, a triple crown hiker is one who has hiked the Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail, and the Appalachian Trail. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Hiking) is the Wikipedia article for the triple crown.

When I lived in NY the AT went through my backyard. I just moved from NY to CO and now the CDT goes through my backyard. I have met lots of AT and CDT hikers. Never have I met someone who has hiked all three trails. It's a very big deal for through hikers.

1. What was your trail name?

2. What did you like and dislike about each trail?

3. What motivated you to do each trail and how did you manage to do the trail economically?

4. External or internal frame pack? and how much did your pack weight fully loaded?

5. When you were on the trail, what food did you crave most? (It's a weird question, but through hikers ALWAYS have one thing they crave)

If you have any cool stories you want to share from the trail, please do :D </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was at a [6] and reading an excerpt from a work of Hobbes. The excerpt spoke about the conflict between Hobbes' Res Etensa and Descartes' Res Cogitans. Hobbes stated that there is a point where the two ideas actually make contact. That was funny to me because how could something material collide with some spiritual. Does this mean that the physical tangible world we have come to despise takes dominance over the spiritual realm? and where do the two collide? Could the pineal gland be the processor of this contact? and can we control the processor to push our consciousnesses to the limit?

What do you think fell friENTs?

Res Cogitans means spirituality and Res Etensa means physical for those of you who aren't well read in early existentialism  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The beginning is just exposition, you can skip to the part that says "Get on with it"

Prozac is NOT the drug for me. I've told my MD, my therapist, and my psychiatrist this (I know lots of doctors. Not my choice) and they all said "Give it another month". I've been on 20mg of prozac since December and I have felt the effects. It's what i like to call the *Light Switch Effect*. One moment I'm happy and motivated, the next I'm extremely depressed (to the point where suicide crosses my mind).

This may seem odd, but I hate the happy stages. It blinds my thoughts and I'm easily distracted from what really matters. I'm too caught up with stupid shit, I am happy to do anything. I HAVE NO PERSONALITY.

It's like I'm addicted to the depression. I want to be happy with out the stupid carefree shit. Therapy works for me, drugs do not (except pot, which will never be publicly endorsed by any members of my team).

**GET ON WITH IT**
To cut to the point, i stopped the Prozac cold turkey two days ago. I know the diminishing half life for Prozac is long, but should i experience any withdraw? I was taking 20mg for 4 months </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Incase you have not seen [this](http://vimeo.com/37119711) video, spend a few minutes watching it. The video raises awareness about the LRA in Uganda. I think it's great that they are raising awareness about a relatively unspoken issue. The thing that makes me a little skeptical of the project is the target audience.

Younger geneartions respond well to change and making a difference (which can be seen in Clinton's campaign and more recently Obama's campaign). The video try's to present change as easily accessible. 

Is this exploitative? I was curious to think hear what /r/philosophy had to think about it. I'm a long time lurker and value the contrasting opinions on this subreddit

	<TEXT> Everything just drives me to the point of insanity. I'm currently in an ED (eating disorder) program and successfully (hopefully) recovering from anorexia (i'm a guy BTW). As I peel back the ED more and more I start to realize how much of my ED was actually depression. I previously assumed it was a control thing (which it still probably is). So the "better" I've been getting through this recovery process, the worse I am actually doing.

I wake up in the morning after getting two good hours of sleep. I mossy on over to the bathroom and that is the highlight of my waking day. I take a nice long shower. For me its 30 minutes where there are no reflections, no people, no society. Just hot water and my natural naked body.

Once I reenter society i realize how much I hate everyone. That optimistic nurse is just a bimbo in my mind. That 'friend' is just an optimistic dumb bitch to me. I never had these impressions of people when i came in to the ED program. My patience is deteriating. The only thing I seem to enjoy are showers and reading.

Oh yeah about the reading, i have become OBSESSIVE over reading philosophy. I run out of reading material to go through. This morning i read a 200 page book on determinism in under two hours. Reading like showering is an escape from society. The problem with reading is, it gives me more reasons to hate society. With iPhones, iPads, Kindles, and every thing inbetween, people are getting stupider.

My overly pessimistic and deterministic attitude makes it extremely difficult to make progress in therapy (which i have almost daily). My therapist doesn't know what to say after 5 minutes. She just sits and stares at me sometimes because she doesn't know what to say. I feel fucking worthless, like no one likes me. I'm feel like I'm somehow a burden to everyone on the unit. No one knows what to do with me. They are going to put me on high alert for suicide, because they think I'm unpredictable.

I came to this place to get better. I'm gaining weight, getting daily therapy, taking prozac (have been for months now), and seeking help. All i get is guy watching me naked taking a shower in the morning and safety contracts.
Please tell me I'm not alone when i say "I hate every living human on this planet including my worthless self". I wanna fucking move to the wilderness and get AWAY from this shit hole we call society </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few months back I started reading about philosophy. I would browse this subreddit and study philosophies mentioned by the posters. I've read countless classic such as beyond good and evil, the prince, the apology, and utopia to name a few.

This was the first time i have "studied" philosophy in an intellectual manner. I have read of philosophy in school and my dad forced me to read Calvin and Hobbes as a kid. To be honest, Bill Waterson has shaped my outlook on life more than any of my teachers, friends, or family members. 

One comic in particular stuck out to me, and i was very pleased to have seen it posted on here. [This](http://i.imgur.com/xypsK.jpg) comic has been stuck in my head for the past 11 years. I remember sitting on my dad's couch as a six year old and spending hours discussing it with my dad. From that point on, I had established a philosophy very similar to the philosophical school of thought that i would later identify as Determinism.

It never really bothered me as a kid growing up. I quite liked the idea and found it comforting. But in the past few months of studying philosophy, it has interfered with my studies. I find it frustrating to read ancient texts from Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient philosophers. Even the writings of Nietzsche and Machiavelli are frustrating to me.

My belief in a nutshell is that every event from genesis to the terminal state can be determined if one were to account for all the variables that affected an event. I could write a book about your great-grandson (if i had a millennium or two to spare accounting for all variables dealing with your great-grandson). I have had lots of people challenge my ideas. All who try and argue it get stumped.

This is why I am asking you /r/philosophy, I want somone to challenge my ideas. If I could get anything out of Beyond Good and Evil, it was that having someone challenge your ideas is very important in your education.

TL;DR Challenge the idea of determinism so i can move on and study philosophy with an open mind

	<TEXT> I am 17 years old and i am in the hospital right now to deal with my Anxiety and depression which has spiraled into an eating disorder. I am on the EDU (Eating disorder unit) floor in the colorado childrens hospital. I have formal diagnosis for Depression, EDNOS (eating disorder not other specified), and anxiety.


I smoked weed socially before this became a problem. I tryed smoking for the first time a month ago and it did WONDERS for me. I made it a tradition to smoke before taking my mom out for sunday brunch. I noticed it helped emensly and i would eat a big brunch and continue to eat normally the rest of that day. Even my mom would notice.

Would it be possible to get a MMJ card. If so who should i be asking? My GP? A MMJ doctor? Just looking for some direction, i will be doing lots of research in the coming months. I turn 18 at the beginning of the summer.

I am thoroughly convinced that Cannabis has lingering effects that will help me get healthy again </TEXT>
