	<TEXT> Day 54 - feeling better than I have in years. Wouldn't say I was feeling 100%, but I'm not even sure if I was before I started using, in all honesty. 

I still have my shitty moments, yet I've noticed they only seem to linger for a few hours now, instead of a few days.

I have no desire to use, even had a drug dream the other night, where I actually said "no" to the guy I used to score from. When I was still using if I ever tried to say "no" to my dealer those 2 letters would of got stuck in my throat and stayed there 'til I said "yes" instead.

I don't think I'll ever be free of the person I used to be, I'm sure he's still in there somewhere. I have, however, managed to shut that fucker up.

Hope you guys and gals are winning your individual battles too </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, same thing my partner tried. I agreed to drug tests and she would watch me do them. And again the addict in me would come up with yet another lie. Usually that I haven't used and that it would still be in my system since I used to use so much.

There's wanting to change and wanting to appear that you have changed. For me the latter was what I used to do a lot of. 

I honestly respect you for what you're dealing with, I can only see things from an addicts perspective so I couldn't imagine what you're dealing with. For me to actually want to get clean, the addiction literally stripped everything from me first. Luckily I now have my girlfriend and son back, but I traveled through Hell to achieve it.

I had to go cold turkey, for me that was the only way. I couldn't taper, as I knew I'd take more if I had it. It's the toughest thing I've ever done but by no means impossible.

Truly hope everything works out for you </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trust me, if he doesn't want/isn't ready to change, then holding his money wont change a thing. My girlfriend tried that with me when she found out, but the addict in me found other ways of getting money. Usually stealing from her or from anyone else I could.

Opiate addiction changes people, usually into selfish liers that will stop at nothing in order to get their next fix. I could tell you to take him to a doctor or something, but in reality, if he doesn't want to change for himself, chances of him changing for someone else are pretty slim.

Sorry if this is coming across harsh, but this sounds like the exact same situation I had with my girlfriend and I kept on lying til she moved away with my son. I continued using for around 6 months after she left then ultimately realised that I couldn't put myself through this anymore.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that you can't force him into it, but you can always support him. If he wants to get clean then that's great, if not do what's best for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Day 17 for me, and I really don't know why I didn't do this sooner. I still get days when I feel like I just wanna hide away from the world and feel sorry for myself, but I did enough of that shit when I was still using.

I've been getting around 7-8 hours sleep a night and always wake up at 6:00am, dunno what that's all about, but in all honesty I've began to like it. I think I've really learned to appreciate things more, too. Music, food, fresh air, but my life is top of the list, I overdosed 4 times in the last 6 month and thinking back just scares the shit out of me. 

I know I could never go back to how I was, but it doesn't stop my brain from occasionally nudging me and telling me "hey, you remember the good times we had on drugs" I do remember of course, but I also remember the downward spiral and destruction they caused a lot clearer. 

I also thought being high made me more social, but in reality it made me a self-centred shell compared to the person I feel like now. I guess that bitch addiction really knows how to manipulate us into thinking we're living in Heaven when in fact we're in Hell and she's holding the pitchfork.

Congrats on day 5 by the way! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No permanent damage, but it may take up to 2 years (for heavy long term users) for the chemical imbalance to sort itself out. That's why we find it hard to feel good about, well anything at times. 

The withdrawal brain finds it hard to produce dopamine (the feel good chemical) after we stop using. 

This doesn't mean you're going to feel like shit for 2 years, you'll still have good days. Problem is, especially during PAWS, our bad days are exactly that.

	<TEXT> So true. Just like falling in love with a person, we're at our most vulnerable and that's what she likes to take advantage of. Giving you the confidence that you crave and an overall better outlook on life. But, like many of my other relationships, you start seeing the flaws that you previously never knew.

She is a very self-centered weed that roots itself deep in your head. She wont give up easily, in fact I find the cravings and mind games more difficult to deal with than the insomnia and everything else she has in her arsenal. 

You're at the point where you could get some real help though, my friend. Don't think twice about it. By far the greatest thing I have ever done. I know it's hard opening up to people, mainly due to the fact she stripped us of all our self esteem, but things will get better. 

Peace   love </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well today is the 13th day without you in my life, although I wouldn't say I'm fully over our inevitable and necessary break-up, but things aren't as bad.

I know this wont bother you too much as you probably have your eyes on your next victim, someone else you can promise the World to and ultimately deliver nothing but pain, anguish and destruction. Self destruction in particular.

Yes, you may have took my family away, you may have destroyed what was left of the life that we made together, but without you being my main priority I actually got to see my 2 year old son and reconciled with the people we hurt the most.

There hasn't been a day gone by where I don't think about you in some capacity, which is normal I suppose. After all, you were actually a big part of my life. You were my shoulder to cry on, you would give me hope when I asked for it. I just wish I knew that you wanted my soul in return.

Now while you go on to destroy someone else, I'm sat here typing. Scared, yes, but guess what? I actually don't mind being afraid of what my life will be like without you. At least I can feel something other than the thin veil you cast over me, numbing all my senses and emotions.

I just hope the next person you cling to realises quickly just what a destructive drug you are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for all the comments guys. Day 11 is here and things are looking brighter, although that could just be the midday Sun blaring through my window.

I've done a lot of reflecting over my situation in this past week or so, and have truly come to hate the thing I once craved, loved and practically worshipped.

I was at the point where I was taking so many pills just to numb the feeling of, well everything to be honest, that I was physically making myself sick and had God knows how many seizures due to overdosing.

My girlfriend has been amazing during this, she isn't one to mince her words and hand out sympathy easily, but she has been a rock for me. 

Just finished a 3 mile run and, although I sweated through another one of my T-shirts, I feel really good. My brain still keeps dropping not so subtle hints to try and make me score again, but the cravings seem to be easier to dismiss.

	<TEXT> This is the perfect opportunity to grasp whatever willpower you have left in you and put it to use. You say you want to be clean and that's the first step to overcoming this. 

It is not going to be easy, however. In fact it will be a War in Hell but you can win. Just take it day by day, hour by hour if you have to, but trust me (I know trust isn't one of our greatest traits) things do get a lot more manageable and easier.

Good luck </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Opiate withdrawal - A journey through Hell </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Where to begin? I guess a little background about my situation, is as good as any.
After 6 years of lying, cheating and stealing to maintain my  habit, after I had lost my job and my family, I decided to call time on my relationship with all opiates/opioids.

Now 6 years is a long time, longer than most of my other relationships in fact, so like any break-up, shit will eventually get messy. I had tried detoxing on many other occasions, so I knew what I was in for. 

Days 1-3 were soul destroying, I never expected 'rock bottom' to be comfortable, but damn. Very hard to maintain positive thoughts, whilst your brain is screaming out for the very thing that put you into this mess. Showering and bathing are essential at this point, just a shame that our old 'best friend' took all our energy and motivation when we kicked him out, so even washing yourself can feel like a chore. Nonetheless it is really helpful for pains and relaxing. 

Days 4-9 were slightly better, sleep came back and the RLS subsided. It almost feels like the Devil knows he can't beat you with pain, so he resorts to filling your head with cravings. This part is the hardest for me, as I contemplate every excuse I can think of that would result in using again. Exercise, as ugly as it sounds in your head, is a great healer for the body and mind. Even when I'm feeling at my most lethargic, I've been forcing myself to either swim, walk or even do some housework and it really keeps the Devil at bay.

Now is day 10 and I must admit I feel a whole lot better than I did yesterday. Don't get me wrong the usual sweats, sneezing and anxiety still play a large part in my day, but I am slowly seeing parts of my 'old self' return as the days pass. 

I'm not really sure what I aim to achieve by posting this, but I just thought I'd do it anyway. Just in case there is a few people out there, still debating whether it's time to 'pay the Devil' and face withdrawal, trust me (not like trust is one of our best attributes) it does get better. 

Just remember Hell is a big place and it will take time to escape.
Good luck </TEXT>
