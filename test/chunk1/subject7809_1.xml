	<TEXT> It will be a wild and revealing journey no doubt.

For you I'd like to clarify some misconceptions. Bad trips, like the kind where you think monsters are chasing you or you're in hell, only occur because the users have asked for this. How? You are dealing with the some of the most powerful subs on the planet, when you injest them to receive their lessons, you are completely at their mercy. To think you can handle yourself when you are anywhere or anything but in your best state is ridiculously vain. You won't have to worry about such trips if you take your set and setting seriously. At doses higher than the most basic (1 tab, 2shroomgrams) SWIM has never left their property and has always saved higher doses in subs for days that went really well. This way the only troubling experiences he has ever encountered were only awe-inspiring and didn't detract from the overall experience, there was no spiraling out into disaster like I've heard from people who take these subs lightly, and of course meditation on the come up will aptly prepare your mind for the "anything goes" mindset that is good for acid, but necessary for shrooms. And one last thing is never think your learning ends, and never think that subs can supplement all you need to learn about yourself and the world alone. You need books, world experience, etc. to fill you in on the rest. Psychedelics are just one tool of many.

	<TITLE> Hippy Flip: Yay or Nay? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> SWIM took 4 grams of shrooms and 2 pills of crystal MDMA at about 11pm at night, he had been smoking marijuana that day but was fully sober at the time of consumption.

It was a long time ago, so my description might be a little bit off. But after ingesting just the shrooms in whole he read the beautiful poetry of Eugenio Montale and waited until the show he had on (Sealab 2021) was starting to distort and then popped one M pill and took a shower. During the shower (which was taken in the dark) he could see Aztec imagery crawling over the walls and had a distinct feeling of "being in a pyramid" and had the sensation of being able to communicate with a spirit that manifested in an overpowering red light. 

After the shower, he popped the second M pill. he left his room and went down to his den. He then saw with open eyes the body of comedian Louie CK contorting into a wheel. He wasn't horrified, but amazed and he knew this was the time to begin learning. However, he had never had this amount of shrooms and vomited. Then his mind began to fill with worries of getting bad M even though he had seen the crystals that had gone into the capsules. He was then struck with the full worry of his death as he vomited more and more until his stomach had emptied itself (but he never saw the capsules so maybe not completely empty) and he was very hot and flustered and rabid from the M. Eventually, after realistically assessing how nightmarish it would be to go to the hospital if he was wrong, he concluded he would trust in his higher power to take care of him whether he lives or dies (good advice for handling ego death: stare death in the face and ask what is the worst it can do to you?). He then put on Deafheaven's latest album (on headphones) and sat back in his sleep. What transpired for the next two hours was seeing impossible materials being built and destroyed over and over again, and not having a complete ego death but an obsession in a Communist way with how the individual fits into the group, the "we". This helped him develop his political beliefs as he saw deeper into both the strengths and weaknesses of socialism and has incorporated some of these realizations into his working political philosophy.

This is one of the experiences that I wish those who stigmatize psychedelics would pay attention to. Bad trips can be worked with, and valid conclusions (not just tripped out vague hippy realizations) can be reached under their influence. I have seen somebody on two tabs and having just smoked a blunt sit down with random strangers at a restaurant and discuss politics even though he heartily disagreed with them. They were Trump supporters (and this is still the same Commie) and he just asked to listen and asked them why, and only told them to try and understand those they disagree with because he was a once hopeful military official talking to these veterans and left them telling "we all want to fight for the same rights". (However, no amount of scholarship money can convince him to call Trump his commander in chief).

tl:dr and/or questions I have: what is your experience with hippy flipping? He says shrooms gives him a "double cup effect" so MDMA only made him feel vainly restless. So do you think they're really compatible? Also, his next plan is to take 6 grams and meditate on Odin's sacrifice for the runes as a way to begin a path of enlightenment less influenced by psychedelics and more influenced by genuine practice. Do you have any ideas for activities, songs, or just advice? The trip report was his highest dose ever. </TEXT>
