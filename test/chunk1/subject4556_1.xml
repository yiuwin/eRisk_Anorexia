	<TEXT> Hey all, I was the winner of Vinylsaurs' first giveaway and I won the Unmasked Batman Funko Pop as their giveaway and they also included a drawing of a Funko Pop I wished to see.


The pop unfortunately came damaged, even though it was bubble wrapped on the sides, you guys forgot to hold it down from the top so it got moved around in the transit and the box got damaged.

Nevertheless I do appreciate a free pop! And I can always find a replacement box for it in the future or just take it out of the box.


[Imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/5vUiv): The Pop, The Dr. Fate pop drawing and with the rest of my collection. Missing from the collection shot is my Gold batmobile, didn't want it to block the other pops.


Thanks!

	<TEXT> There are two factions of SHIELD left.

One is ran by Coulson which was past down by Nick Fury with how the organization should be ran how Coulson sees fit.


Another organization that Bobbi and Mack are working for that is also SHIELD, or they call it "The Real SHIELD" just like the previous one.


Who do you guys think is running "The Real SHIELD" and will it transfer to SWORD or HAMMER? 

I personally thinks that Hill is running the new SHIELD funded by Tony Stark. 

Also the Inhumans are developing really nicely, I am a fan of the no eyes Inhuman, or some people presumes him as The Reader.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you guys are upset over retired pops, it seems like they are taking them out of the vault guys.

Ursula, Slave Leia, Luke (Jedi) are coming out of the vault confirmed.

With more like Greedo, other Star Wars collection rumored to be coming out again!


If you have a holy grail of acquiring a retired pop, it might be smart to wait to see if they release them again.


Here's hoping to see retired DC villains like Two-Face, Penguin and Watchmen come out of the vault!


How do you guys feel about this? I think it's great that some of the retired ones are coming out again since I was never collecting back then.

	<TEXT> I placed an order and it went through to shipping!

I was looking for V for Vendetta Funko Pop and I found one on Amazon.ca for $17.78. I was like dam, that's low so I bought it and it processed and shipped.

Today I checked and they changed the price to $178.78.

Guess they missed their price when they first put it up.

I know that the average price for it is $40~ but if I buy it from Ebay, it kills me with the conversion and the shipping so glad I got it from amazon.ca so I don't pay extras for shipping and customs, etc.

	<TEXT> Hey guys, Canadian here.

Looking at a few options to pick up exclusives online since it is pretty much hard to find exclusives in Canada and online is the only option.

I have ordered from Popcultcha.au and is currently waiting for my orders and waiting to see if I get charged customs, which I doubt since it's airmail.

Now, has anybody bought from Entertainment Earth internationally and got charged for customs?

I am looking to order some pops from there and I don't want to get hit with hafty custom charges for a few pops.

Thanks guys and also beside Popcultcha and EE, if there are any other options for international shipping low costs(Pops and reasonable shipping) and no customs, let me know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I have seen somewhere on here of some sites that you can buy from where they don't have to pay extra customs at the door for international shipping.


What sites are optimal for buying funko pops to ship to Canada?

Currently, I am using toysonfire.ca

They ship from Ottawa so no customs at the door but sometimes its hard to get the funko pops I want, especially the US exclusive stores ones.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's the list I have gathered from the Mid Season Finale, just comment if I missed anything.


I have hyper-linked many of the terms/character origins from the comics for people to view easily and to research further upon. 

**Confirmation**

* **The Diviner** contains the [Terrigen Crystal](http://marvel.wikia.com/Terrigen_Crystals) which it creates the [Terrigen Mist](http://marvel.wikia.com/Terrigen_Mists) that creates the Inhuman which is called [Terrigensis](http://marvel.wikia.com/Terrigenesis). 

* **Skye** is [Daisy Johnson aka Quake!](http://marvel.wikia.com/Daisy_Johnson_%28Earth-616%29) 

* **Skye's dad/Doctor** is [Calvin Zabo aka Mister Hyde!](http://marvel.wikia.com/Calvin_Zabo_%28Earth-616%29)


* **Raina** isn't confirmed but many believed her to be her comic counterpart [Raina](http://marvel.wikia.com/Raina_%28Earth-616%29). [Here's a glimpse of her post-transformation eye and cheek](http://i.imgur.com/jkbyt09.jpg)

* **Ward and Agent 33** are now teamed up and are in the free.

* **Doctor/Mister Hyde** is also free waiting for **Skye/Daisy** to come to him after the Terrigensis.  


* **Mack** is alive and is free from the city's security protocol. 

* There are other **Inhumans** out there that holds **the Diviner** on Earth?

**Fine Line between Death and Alive**

As we know in the MCU, death has very little meaning so I decided to put these guys in here.

* **Whitehall** is shown shot on screen and presumed dead. But who knows if he's actually dead. Very unlikely that Whitehall would not be wearing bulletproof vest, he's not stupid. He's one of Hydra's genius heads. We'll see in the future if he's actually dead or alive. I still think if he's alive, he'll become the [**Kraken**](http://marvel.wikia.com/Daniel_Whitehall_%28Earth-616%29)

* **Tripp** is shown turned into stone and dusted away and is most likely dead but there's a theory of how he actually managed to get past Mack who was suppose to be guarding anybody who aren't the Inhuman quality as you can see how Mack guarded against Coulson. We'll find out in the future!


**Future Prediction!**

* **The Inhuman at the end** many believed him to be the [**Reader**](http://marvel.wikia.com/Reader_%28Inhuman%29_%28Earth-616%29) or [**Videmus**](http://marvel.wikia.com/Videmus_%28Earth-616%29).



* **Mack and Bobbi/Mockingbird** are secretly working for somebody else, my guess would be Nick Fury or S.W.O.R.D. 


* **Agent Koenig**"s" are confirmed [**LMD**](http://marvel.wikia.com/Life-Model_Decoy) basically although not confirmed on screen when Coulson told Billy and Eric to activate Theta protocol when things go south or could be a red herring! 


~~There was suppose to be a big Age of Ultron tied in, I am assuming it is either Agent Koenig"s" being LMD which has to do with Ultron's army or Skye/Quake being hinted at cameo in Age of Ultron?~~ My bad, It's suppose to be a later episode not this one.

	<TEXT> Now I see a lot of complaining on this subreddit and not contributing on the main Technical Alpha feedback forums. 

The point of Technical Alpha is to give data and feedbacks to Blizzard to balance the game and optimize it better for future players in Beta test and game release.


The more data and feedback we return to Blizzard, the more patches they can roll out to test the changes. 


So next time we want to rant about Nova or slow gold gain or no patches, voice your opinion on the main Technical Alpha feedback forums!

http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/forum/#forum13267625


Yes, I do know that there are a lot of people giving feedbacks but more voices and data, the better!


It is also good to do discussion on the reddit forum but also would be beneficial for Blizzard if we include a make a post on the feedback forum and include it in the reddit discussion!


Now let's get out to the nexus, have fun and contribute!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I just rewatched the movie and had a question on the continuity of the canon story in the future. 


When in the past, Logan asked the young Charles to read his mind so he can unlock his ownself.

When the young Charles was going through Logan's past, present and future, it was about the past X-Men movies with the Phoenix killing Professor Xavier.


So if the Sentinel future was in the storyline of Phoenix, isn't Professor Xavier supposed to be dead as the Phoenix killed him? How is he alive?

Did they ever explain this or did I miss something?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So putting aside their personalities and their past, based solely on Elizabeth and Courtney's performances on their dishes, I do believe Courtney deserved to win over Elizabeth.

If you look at Elizabeth's dishes, she overcooked her Octopus, she undercooked her Lamb and she undercooked her cake but she salvaged her dessert by using the outside of the cake but still, she failed to execute all her dishes properly. 

Courtney cooked her appetizer and the entree much better than Elizabeth did but fucked up on dessert by eating, misplating and salted cherries.  

Overall, Courtney cooked much better than Elizabeth. 

From the past finales, it's kind of hard to tell who would win based on the dishes but this finale, I knew Courtney was going to win when Elizabeth fucked up on Octopus and the Lamb. 


The question is, why are people saying it's staged and why are people hating on Courtney when she just cooked better than Elizabeth?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Theory] Who was protecting Skye and Skye's origin possibly and ties into future movies </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-21 08:40:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I am re watching the past episodes and I noticed something. I do not have any knowledge of the comic's history as I do not read them so I have to do some diggings. 

I believe the agent that was protecting and holding Skye in the village that was slaughtered is the alien in the Guest House.

So we all remember the blue alien that is believed to be of Kree Origin, which is true if my theory is correct.

Interesting thing, when May and Coulson went to Mexico to find the Agent that was with the squad that was sent to uncover the 084 back then, he said something that has connection to the Alien.

["We found the senior agent under a bridge. He managed to escape with a gunshot wound to the neck, but he bled out. He was still holding on to the 0-8-4."](http://i.imgur.com/QNgg2bM.png)

So the Alien in TAHITI room has a wound to the neck: [The Alien](http://i.imgur.com/aQVoeok.png)


So the man said an *agent* was holding onto 084, aka Skye so how can the alien be that agent? I believe the alien has the ability to shapeshift. 


So I did some research on Kree and any aliens in the Marvel universe that has the ability to shapeshift and found out about Ruul. And the wound doesn't look like a gunshot wound because he was shapeshifted and transfer into a wound looking like that. 

[Ruul's history](https://marvel.com/universe/Ruul)

So Ruul is an alien race who are basically evolved Kree. 

So Skye is of a Kree/Ruul origin. Skye is an 084 which is an object of an unknown origin and the alien at the Guest House has shapeshifted and disguised himself as an agent when the attack at the village happened and died or almost died? protecting Skye.  


The reason why GH325 works is because of Skye's origin as Kree/Ruul. 


If this theory is true, it would tie into the Thanos' storyline and the Guardian of the Galaxy as well as the Inhumans movie in the future, which is in development/works. Mentioned by Kevin Feige: [Clip](http://ca.ign.com/videos/2011/10/16/nycc-inhumans-buzz)

This could tie into Age of Ultron as well, where Skye, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were the first three survivors of the Inhumans project by Kree.

I believe Skye is a human that Kree/Ruul were testing on for the Inhumans project and the raid that happened in the village was by Baron Strucker/HYDRA.

Baron Strucker captured Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch when they were very young and the alien at the Guest House guarded Skye and protected her. 

Baron Strucker probably called Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch "Miracles" which the term could be developed into the Inhumans after The Guardian of the Galaxy and Age of Ultron.

If you guys are wondering what is happening, a lot of people in Western Canada/Canada are d/cing randomly over the game in 1-2mins and it last about 5-10second and it is annoying.


This started happening last night and is still happening up to this point.


I don't know what is causing it, there hasn't been a post about this and Riot hasn't issue any concerns about it.

Riot's Statement: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=45825782#45825782

tl:dr: People in Western Canada/West Coast/EVERYWHERE are d/cing over the game randomly with perfect ping. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Theory] Who May responded to? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-12 06:06:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is my theory based on the facts we know canon to the MCU. 

Timeline of Marvel Cinematic Universe: http://marvel.wikia.com/Earth-199999

So SHIELD as an organization respond to the World Security Council. 

What is the World Security Council? 
http://marvel.wikia.com/World_Security_Council_(Earth-199999)

The World Security Council is an international organization based around ideals of maintaining global security and fostering world peace. They are positioned above S.H.I.E.L.D.

During the Avengers, it is appeared that Nick Fury has been working with World Security Council to work on weaponizing the Tesseract which they recovered from Red Skull of HYDRA and it was under [Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Project_P.E.G.A.S.U.S.)

Nick Fury convinced them that the alien threat(Loki and his invasion force of [Chitauri](http://marvel.wikia.com/Chitauri) was Loki's actions and that Asgardians were not a threat. 

So Nick Fury formed the Avengers to fight off the alien threat. 

In the aftermath of the crisis, they argued with Fury over releasing the Tesseract and Loki back to Asgard, and of letting the Avengers go into the world, but ultimately adjourned the debate.

The World Security Council does not want anything to do with extraterrestrial races anymore because it appears as a threat to earth and they do not like the idea of a team of super heroes to protect earth from alien threat. 

So aftermath of the Avengers, World Security Council probably ordered Nick Fury to create a separate division to protect earth on extraterrestrial threats.

Thus [S.W.O.R.D] was created.

S.W.O.R.D. (Sentient World Observation and Response Department) is a counterterrorism and intelligence agency. Its purpose is to deal with extraterrestrial threats to world security.

World Security Council probably ordered Nick Fury to create S.W.O.R.D. to deal with all the extraterrestrial threats apart from S.H.I.E.L.D.

So how does S.W.O.R.D. tie in with Agent of SHIELD and other movies? 

S.W.O.R.D. was created to combat future extraterrestrial threats. The facility that Coulson discovered was a secret SWORD facility probably ran by Nick Fury and his trusted scientists. 

So the alien in the tube was probably found by SWORD and they were doing multiple experiments with it. 

Why is it so secretive? Because World Security Council is above SHIELD and they probably want to keep it as a secret. 

So May answered at the end of Episode 15 to Nick Fury which Nick Fury ordered May to keep a tab on Coulson so Coulson wouldn't go around snooping at SHIELD to find answers thus revealing about S.W.O.R.D. to possibly Agent HAND. 

If it turns out to be S.W.O.R.D. , it ties into future movies with Captain America: The Winter Soldier(Maybe, haven't seen it yet) and Guardian of the Galaxy if they have Kree-Skrull invasion story line.

If the facility was under S.W.O.R.D.'s then the alien could turn out to be Kree which ties everything nicely to the Inhumans which would lead into Avengers: Age of Ultron with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. 

And how can S.W.O.R.D. remain a secret to the Clairvoyant? It is possible that Clairvoyant can see with all the eye inplants across the world and is also within SHIELD to see everything. Since S.W.O.R.D. and the World Security Council is above SHIELD, the Clairvoyant cannot see about the facility and S.W.O.R.D.

Also to note: Dr. Streiten fell off the radar to SHIELD when Coulson's team was trying to find him about the Guest House.

Nick Fury is also off the grid. 

Nick Fury is planning something, SWORD or not, I do think there is a sub organization that he has created.

/u/Afterburyner pointed out that, Marvel was planning on introducing SWORD in a deleted ending of Thor as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp8JPsW4XIE feature=youtube_gdata_player

	<TITLE> [Spoiler] Possible identity of what was in the tank and possibly Clairvoyant connection </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-05 08:26:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know a lot of people thought of the alien as to be Kree origin. 

So I was doing some readings on HYDRA and noticed something about their technology. 

It says "HYDRA's level of technology is as highly advanced as that of any on Earth, based in part on technology of the alien Gnobians discovered by Baron von Strucker in 1944."

Now, knowing nothing about "Gnobians" I decided to search them up. 

This is what I found : 

http://www.comicvine.com/gnobians/4060-59731/

The alien is blue and does resemble what was in the tank. 

It says that they are extraterrestrials that possessed psychic powers. 

Now this could be a connection to the Clairvoyant as well because maybe the alien somehow has a barrier so that the Clairvoyant cannot see what happened there thus Clairvoyant doesn't know how Coulson survived. 

Or that the Clairvoyant is the Gnobians origin and he couldn't see what happened to Coulson because they can't read each other? 

I don't know anything about Gnobians so I am just putting this out there. 

EDIT: Alright so I read more about the Gnobians and discovered something. 

http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/gnobians.htm

It said : The Gnobian mother could psychically heal others but doing so required lowering her mental safeguards, linking her mind of that of her patient. They possessed advanced technology specially suited to their psychic powers, such as the Memory Chamber, which could call forth memories from its occupants and render them in a three-dimensional holographic environment.

And with that, In 1944, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker discovered an alien race, the Gnobians. They were an innocent but powerful race, and the Gnobian mother, who had born all the Gnobians on Earth, she was intrigued by Strucker and wanted him to be her guide. When Strucker was severely wounded battling Nick Fury, he went to the Gnobian mother for aid and she merged with him healing him. Unfortunately, Strucker's insanity infected the Gnobian mother.

Who is Baron Strucker? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Strucker

So he is the leader of HYDRA and if my theory is correct, this could come together.

Baron Strucker was casted for Age of Ultron so introducing him and the Gnobians race in Agent of SHIED makes sense. 

This would also tie in with Captain America Winter Soldier with the HYDRA organization and SHIELD "UPRISING". 

Also I do think the alien could be a Gnobian Mother or just a Gnobian. It does say Gnobian Mother has died and so it could be possible that it isn't a Gnobian Mother and just a Gnobian. 

So, considering that, If Baron Strucker went to Gnobian mother to get treated, he would be linked with her and would gain psychic ability as well as Memory Chamber.  

So this could prove Baron Strucker to be the Clairvoyant but wait, if he is the leader of HYDRA and the facility the alien was held was a HYDRA facility, this doesn't add up and why he couldn't see what happened in there.

Baron couldn't see what was happening because possibly Gnobian's psychic ability cannot be used upon each other or that the alien is indeed Gnobian Mother. 

Nick Fury went specifically to that facility by "HYDRA" instead of working under SHIELD, that would mean that there will be an UPRISING in the SHIELD organization and Nick Fury has set up a sub section in HYDRA organization that he has created. 

So if Baron Strucker is the Clairvoyant, he must have infiltrated SHIELD and Nick Fury must have infiltrated HYDRA!! 

This theory is starting to get better and better. I like theorizing.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Spoiler) The Facility Discussion </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-05 07:55:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of, I am not a huge comic geek so I don't know the Comic universe or the MCU inside and out. So excuse me if I make silly accusations. 

So while people are trying to figure out who the blue guy is, let's talk about the facility and why Clairvoyant can't see what happens in that facility.

So people have assumed that the facility was HYDRA's because of the "Bob" that died and he is Agent of HYDRA and sidekick of Deadpool. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob,_Agent_of_HYDRA although Deadpool has nothing to do with the series. 

So HYDRA had the "alien" for a long time let's assume and was keeping him in the "Guest House" which the alien would be assumed Guest to Earth. So HYDRA has been harvesting from the alien and has been making a Serum that brought back Coulson. 

So the Serum used on Coulson and Skye isn't the SuperSoldier Serum correct? 

So the Serum part will all tie into the Captain America Winter Soldier. 

Now, I don't want to discuss how long the alien has been here and who is he because we don't know as of yet. 

What I want to discuss is Nick Fury brought Agent Coulson and other specialists to a HYDRA facility to bring back Coulson and wanted to hide everything from SHIELD.

Why is that? Why is Nick Fury working with HYDRA to bring back his friend and why would he want to hide from SHIELD? What did Nick Fury give up to save Coulson?

Maybe this might get explained in Captain America Winter Soldier. 

And most importantly, why can't the Clairvoyant see anything that happens at the facility? I would assume this might have to do with the Alien.

I want people's thoughts who has more knowledge than I in MCU and the Comic universe and educate me on this.

	<TEXT> Just wondering if anybody has any problem with connecting/loading into game.

After champion select, I couldn't connect into the game or load it up because of "Firewall" is blocking my connection.

Obviously it is strange because if it is blocking my connection, I wouldn't even be able to connect to the servers to even log in.

I am not sure if it is a server wide problem or a specific ISP problem. (Seem like it's happening everywhere)

I have asked a Rioter about it and it didn't helped. He asked me to restart my client and run a VPN. Didn't work.

RIP Ranked Game :c

	<TITLE> Vel'Koz's First Contact </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-21 06:30:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyb2KC-q7ls

Now a new teaser was released by Riot. It showcases the First Contact of Vel'Koz with a "Demacia soldier".

In the video, it shows that knowledge is the purpose he was sent here in the first place. Void Invasion is coming as we already know it.


What we don't know is how long he has been here? There is going to be special interaction with Zilean lorewise but what is strange is why does he only have special interaction with his battlecast skin and not his original? 

Does it mean, it has to do with Battlecast Lore and not his original lore? Because Battlecast lore is part of the lore but that only comes in after Creator Viktor created them. 

Now I have gathered some theories from the main subreddit so I'll put them here.

1) Since Vel'Koz's lore is in 1st person and other champions' lores are in 3'rd person view, people believes that Vel'Koz has been here for a long time and he has consumed or observed every champion has written their history and lore.

This theory is a possibility but I doubt it.

2) Another person believed that the solider in the video is Kassadin because of his lore:

 "Within a decaying cyclopean city, Kassadin found secrets of the kind that he will never share - secrets that made him quake with fear at the visions of things to come that were thrust upon him. The power of the place threatened to consume him forever, but Kassadin took the only route available to him in order to survive - he let the Void inside him."

This is also a possibility. 

Let's hear all your guys' thought about Vel'Koz with all the information we have at the moment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a new Season! We are still in the Pre-season stage when Riot is experimenting with the new items, game flow and etc. 

Targon and Relic Shields are OP at this stage and yes they are nerfing the CD on it but they are still keeping the Duo Lane usage of the item.

I see a lot of people complaining about the item's usage breaking the "Meta". 

Riot implemented new different exciting playstyles and items that allows us to experiment new laning styles and "Meta" so we can see more exciting stuffs rather than, 1,1,2,1. 

With the new items, new game flow and changes, people will start to discover new ways to play the game and still make it work but the community is refusing to change how the game was played the past seasons. 

Last season, everybody complained about how the Meta is stale and all we see is the same shit every single game.

Now in the pre-season, people are experimenting new things and new playstyles and everybody wants to make the game like it was before. 

Teams that are using new meta will not make them any stronger against teams that are using the old meta once the Targon/Relic Shields are nerfed. 

The community needs to be more open minded and should stop trying to contain the meta. Riot is purposely leaving how the Targon/Relic Shields work.

**tl;dr**: Riot is giving us a chance to branch out of the Meta and experiment new playstyles but the community is not willing to change. The new upcoming Meta will not make the previous Meta any weaker.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Future Command and Conquer Titles [Discussion] [Possible Spoilers] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-30 06:57:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wanted to open up a Discussion thread about the future of Command and Conquer Titles. 

**Possible Spoilers from previous games if you haven't finished them yet**

It's obvious that they heard our voice and they are going to steer away from the Free2Play model and focus on what made their games popular and stay true to its genre, Campaign mode with story driven games with resource gathering and base building.


Possibilities: 

**Tiberium Universe**
 
Although EA announced that Command and Conquer 4 was the last of the Tiberium Universe, it would not be as they could continue off the Command and Conquer 4 ending when the actor said Kane will be back or along the line. Fun Fact: The actor is related to Joe Kucan

We also need to remember the ending of Command and Conquer 3's Scrin story when they said to prepare for the full invasion force. 

I would love a new game primary focused on the Scrin faction as we could really learn about Tiberium more. 

So If there is a new Tiberium game, it will be focused on Scrin most likely. Their origin, Tiberium origin and their "Full Invasion on earth".

**Red Alert Universe**

Now, I feel like they cannot continue with the way Red Alert 3 Uprising left off as it just feels like segmented with the story line and the three factions. If they were to continue off the Allies, Soviet and Empire of the Rising Sun, I feel like they would have to bring in a new faction or they would have to create another situation like they did for Red Alert 3, a new timeline in an alternate universe. 

If they were to create a Red Alert based game, it would be a completely new timeline in an alternate universe or a new faction with the current 3 ones.

**Generals Universe**

Now it is possible they can still release the new Command and Conquer but under the Generals title as I do believe EA still owns the content to the game before it was scraped. They were already planning on a campaign story so it is possible. 

So a new Generals game will be the next most likely possible game.

They could still release FPS genre related Command and Conquer game or even an MMORPG game in the Tiberium universe but I doubt it'll not be an RTS genre game. 

I hope for a continuation in the Tiberium Universe that follows the Command and Conquer 3's story before the Command and Conquer 4 or they could mixed it up with the aftermath of the Command and Conquer 4 with Scrin invasion.  

Most likely it'll be a "Generals 2" up next with the content they already created. 

Post your thoughts and share away!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys!

I have a small QoL that can improve for Hearthstone Friendlist section!

It should let us make a note for people on the friendlist so we can make a note on who is who.

This will be beneficial to a lot of people because as your friendlist grow, you need to keep track of who is who.

As a player from League of Legends, this is great since a lot of my friends from League are playing Hearthstone and their battletags aren't the same as their tag on League so I can keep track of who is who.

Also this function is also present at the moment for League of Legends :)

tl;dr: Add a note function in the friendlist so we can make a note if needed.


Also Side Note: Anybody has a bug where you cannot accept a friendrequest?  </TEXT>

I just started playing Hearthstone a few days ago and I have been enjoying it a lot. I have been playing Ranked and Unranked and have been trying to level up my classes and such.

I have played 2 Arenas so far with Mage and Shaman. Score is 5-3 and 1-3.

Now, when I am drafting for classes, I am not sure what to draft for the specific class so I was wondering if there is an Arena drafting guide for each class that somebody made?

	<TITLE> My Experience with my dead dog [Experience] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-11 17:37:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello /r/paranormal

I decided I will share with you guys my first experience.

I live in Canada now but before I was born in back home in Asia and lived there for like 10-12 years.

I do not remember how old I was but I was young, like around 10 years old. This happened in my old house back in ASia. The house was built from ground up but it's just a side note, has nothing to do with my experience.

Also to note, I am Buddhist and I have a Buddha Shrine in my house. This occurred in the proximity of it.  

Also there is a huge yard at the back of my house that is unused so when my dog died, we buried it back there. This occurred around a week period post my dog's death.

So I was upstair alone and I was showering to get ready to go out. After I was done, I was walking downstairs and as I was walking downstairs, I heard the sound of a medicine bottle being shaked. The sound that you make when you shake a bottle with medicine pills inside it. Nobody was upstairs at the moment so I was surprised and I went back upstairs to check.

On the table which is in proximity of my Buddha Shrine. I saw a medicine bottle right on the table. So I grabbed it and I was surprised. 

That moment after I grabbed it, I had an experience. It was like a second to 2 second when I saw a black shade approached at me and filled my vision. It was kind of like a blackout but for like 2 seconds. That moment is when I know that it was my dog that died a week ago since he had a black fur. It was a cool experience and it was a way of my dog's spirit of saying final goodbye to me.

	<TITLE> Found an unusual Fizz Playful/Trickster Bug </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-11 07:16:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello Reddit!

I am here to see if any of you have encountered a weird Fizz Playful/Trickster Bug. Now I know that the old Playful/Trickster no damage bug still exist and I have reported it to Riot and they found the source and are fixing it.

But today I found a weird bug for his E(Playful/Trickster) I got stunned by Annie's W stun when I was on my pole. 

Not sure if it is specifically with Annie's W stun or anything. Haven't try and duplicated yet. I have told a Rioter about this but they didn't look into it yet.

Was wondering if anybody ran into it, being CC while on the pole duration of Playful/Trickster.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello Reddit, just wanted to bring to your attention that as you may already know, Riot fixed Fizz's Playful/Trickster no damage bug a few patches ago and it wasn't fully fixed.

Some people already experienced this but I experienced it personally today in a game.

So I talked to a Rioter about the issue and he forwarded it on and they found what was causing it right away on the live server and they are working on it to fix it.

[Screenshot of the chat](http://gyazo.com/b5606ed1a124a4efed00aad1723cf0c4)

Just making this post to let the community know that Riot is aware of the bug again and found the source of it and will be fixing it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> MOBAFire Community Cup's Challenger Disqualification </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-23 02:20:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello reddit, I am back again!

I am here to bring this issue to you guys, the community about MOBAFire.

If you didn't know, my first thread got deleted for witchhunting so I'll fill you in on it.

Several teams that included Challenger players including mine signed up for the MOBAFire Community Cup for August. Tournament was delayed for 2 hours because of admin issues and about 3-4 hours into the tournament, the admins started to DQ all the teams that had challenger players or challenger ranked 3s/5s. 

The issue was that we had challenger tier players in either soloque, ranked 3s/5s. The main issue was that we had to wait 4 hours, spend the entire afternoon and clear the day for this tournament. The official tournament rules did not state that Challenger Tier players were not allowed to participate in the cup. 

[Official Rules Page](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/tournament/mobafire-community-cup-na-august-66#rules)

Okay, now onto the current news.

The admins disqualified "all" of the teams that included players with Challenger Tier.

The Community Cup continued and it was completed. Upon further investigation in the finals, the two teams are consisted of Challenger Tier players. 

[The Tournament Bracket](http://challonge.com/mobacupNA)

[The First Team (C4 eSports)](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/tournament-team/c4-esports-4199)

[The Second Team (Godbless Team questionmark)](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/tournament-team/godbless-team-questionmark-6172)


C4 eSports had hashinshin who is well known to the community is a Challenger Soloque player.

[Hashinshin's lolking](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/349795)

C4 eSports also had YahooDotCom who is a player with Challenge ranked 5's Rating.

Godbless Team questionmark had Oregon D BAG who is a player with Challenger 5s Ranking. 

[Oregon D Bag's lolking](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/19382741)

Now, before anybody make any assumptions about the purpose of this post, I am going to make it clear to everybody.

I am not making this post to deny the rewards of the teams that won or that participated. I am here to justify the unfairness disqualifications of the Challenger teams that were DQ but some others were able to compete to the end.

Why would the tournament admin disqualified most of the challenger teams and left other challenger teams that he favors in the tournament? This is the power abuse by the tournament admin. 

**Misc:**

People have linked me to the discussion thread of the past tournament page that says Challenger players were not allowed to participate. All rules of the tournament should be listed in the official rules section, it is the MOBAFire's fault.

MOBAfire's words about the Community Cup: "The vision for these series of tournaments is to cultivate growth withing the community for all levels of skill and to provide consistent competition and incentive for teams to pursue their dream of competing at the highest levels."

Are Challengers tier players not part of the Community? 


**tl;dr: Read through it please, so you guys don't jump to conclusion.** </TEXT>
