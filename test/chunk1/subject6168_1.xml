Our 3 sets each use the helm slot. Most of our powerful class legendaries come from the helm slot too, not to mention andies and the new leoric crown.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I often run it with high CDR and Vyr's. This allows me to burst down elite packs frequently but the best part is the short black hole cooldown. RoF with black ice rune decimates packs that are black hole'ed. My usual set up is drop first Hydra, black hole and drop 2nd Hydra. This allows their frost novas to stagger.

Again this is HC play. I value high control over fast clearing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just wanted to make a quick note about frost Hydra. Double Hydra, the helm that gives them frost nova and the RoF source are indispensable for hardcore play. I run without a signiture spell and comfortably clear T5. Was hoping for a better RoF buff to push me into T6 but we'll see. I'm confident they'll tinker with channeled spells again.

Yes this set up does less damage, but the mob control is amazing for hc.I always get positive feedback in group play. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> zDPS - Rime/Frosties/Fist of Az questions </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-03 21:21:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all,

I'm just seeking some general direction and build advice. While playing on my barb I've found a decent Rimeheart, an ok pair of frostburns and a fist of Az. I haven't used my monk in a long time so I'm unsure how to make best use of these items. What other items would compliment these 3 things and what kind of EP spec should I use? I'm assuming a high cdr/toughness build is what I'm aiming for. I read the zDPS wiki but it doesn't really talk about a possible shatter build.

Thanks in advance

	<TEXT> It's a fun item but I wouldn't make it the center piece of your spec. I read on the wizard forums that it scales with fire damage. I use swords to plow and grim harvest to up the globes, but I'll be mainly using seismic slam or ancient spear and collect globes when there's a lot.

It's good supplemental damage that helps your party and keeps you topped up. Doubly so if used with reaper wraps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mainly for those unaware about this fun patch buff. I recently found a [Swiftmount](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/swiftmount) flail.

I equipped it, used steed charge with endurance rune, along with frevor and Lord commander passives, with about 42% cooldown reduction you can have 100% uptime. That is, it'll be off cooldown the moment the spell duration ends. 

It's really fun and enjoyable when doing quick bounties, you'll be blazing through everything at absurd speeds. When doing normal splits I can usually do 4/5 or 5/5 A2 bounties by the time the other farmers finish A1. I usually roll with Phalanx Bowmen and they can kill things while you're riding around. Same cooldown as steed. Tried it with nightmare rune but the little cooldown was driving me nuts :)

Enjoy! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 2.0.5 Cinder Switch viable now? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-21 15:11:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all,

So I was checking this guide http://www.diablofans.com/forums/diablo-iii-class-forums/crusader-the-church-of-zakarum/88054-fiery-hammers-power-of-furnace-t6-fire-hammerdin about a fire crusader and there was mention of maybe using the newly buffed cinder switch instead of a furnace. I was just wondering if anyone has experimented with it yet? The 250% dmg at a potential 50% proc seems like it would be good. I have the plan but I'm currently lacking the materials. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> FotF +Eberli Charo build? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-16 20:11:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all

So after losing my first crusader to an unfortunate DC on hardcore I decided to make another because I found a FotF while playing on my monk. After being 70 for 2 hours I had an Eberli Charo drop. I was wondering if there's any good build choices that combines these 2 items? Or should I stick to a holy shotgun build?

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is one game sufficient to go from 1 to 70? Or would two half clears be better? (1 to 40 then 41 to 70)
Also what if the person makes the level 1 game then leaves and brings their 70 to help partially clear bounties? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Iron Skin doesn't always seem to proc (bug?) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-25 18:36:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I like the playstle of a thorns build. I'm sitting at 18,000 thorns and still working on gearing up. I've been noticing though that iron skin seems a little unreliable at times. I'll use it but the big thorns numbers don't always pop up. It seems like it doesn't always proc. This is especially evident when using the flash rune during fast bounties. I'll pop iron skin, run into a pack, get hit a bunch of times but I don't receive the speed buff increase. Seems to work only half the time. Has anyone else noticed this when using reflective skin or flash? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What build is in the video? It differs from the original one in your old post. I'm currently sitting at 42% CDR and in interested in trying this when I get home. I play HC as well, so pressing cooldowns and running around seems ideal. Wish I had Borne's to craft, would get me in that sweet spot. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Playing a WD again, need a little info </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-09 20:18:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My first character when D3 vanilla launched was a WD, my first 60 was a WD, my first inferno Diablo kill was with the same WD. I used to run a pet/thorns/life regen build and it was the most fun I had with the class. Sort of a lazy doctor build. Clear speeds on mp6 inferno were reasonably fast. Then I took a long break and I'm just getting back into d3. I noticed my old gear and thorns build wasnt working as well.
 

What I'd like to know is with the new changes since 2.0 (been out of the loop a bit), is a pet/thorns/regen build still viable at 70? I play HC so diving into higher torments as quickly as possible isn't a priority. Between work, life and my 2 kids, my play is casual. Any tips or info would be greatly appreciated. If thorns isn't viable, then what other pet build that promotes the same time of gameplay would work?

Thanks! </TEXT>
