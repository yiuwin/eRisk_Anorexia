	<TEXT> There is much more to analyze in the music itself, but I think Daft Punk tries to capture the vastness of the world through repetition in this song. Around the world...something is happening around the world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Strings will usually become "false" every 3~5 months or so. Get new strings ASAP! Also, like any other piece created from wood, the physical properties of the violin will change, causing the tone to change. This takes years of constant use, and create a richer sound. However, newer violins are made to sound good right after they are made, enticing players so they can be sold easily, which leads to the violin losing it's tone after a few years.

Edit: not all new violins lose their tone, there are many good, new violins out there, but it is something to keep in mind. I prefer older violins myself :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the idea that eating a certain number of people gives titans "back" their "humanity," remember at the end of episode 13 of the anime, there is "titan throw-up" that is introduced. I think this shows the viewer/reader that titans are simply killing humans for the sake of killing, and that their biological response to eating too many humans is to regurgitate them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Chaconne from Partita No. 2 in D Minor - Bach. This piece is of death and sorrow transcending to reminiscence and joy, ending with acceptance and rest. Besides the musical mastery Bach exemplifies, the emotion behind this piece is unmatched by any other. 
Another choice of mine would be Stairway to Heaven (live at Madison Square Garden) - Led Zeppelin. "I think this is a song of hope..."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the story covers up the fact that it is nearly impossible to eat titan flesh because 1. The heat they give off and 2. How they evaporate on death. Just putting it out there </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The anime and manga compliment each other very well. I began with the anime, and when I watched the last episode at the time (I believe it was 6), I went to the succeeding manga and instantly fell in love. I blew through 35 chapters in a week I was so entranced. Anyway, since having caught up, watching the anime adds that extra touch of visual mastery that connects each page, each frame of the manga together. I recommend reading the manga and not just watching the anime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just thought it would be interesting if the community had more input on the development of skins. Maybe, Riot can have a poll for a certain champion that defines theme, colors, character expression, etc. that people can vote on. After the votes are tallied up, Riot can finalize the character art and ingame look. Not only will this increase community interaction, but it will also give summoners that real feeling of contributing to the League of Legends.  </TEXT>
