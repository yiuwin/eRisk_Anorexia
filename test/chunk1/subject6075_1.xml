	<TEXT> Pass out alone in the middle of an empty abandoned road in an old navy ship yard. A security officer found me and drove me to the hospital where I woke up with an IV belligerent yelling because I didn't know where I was... last thing I remembered was sitting at a bus stop drinking 3 buzz balls. Look em up. Lololol I was so embarrassed  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk why their protection even matters! I would actually rather they threw them all in a shitty isolated trailer park called PedoPark and everyone knew where it was. It doesn't seem to really matter that you can check. My next door neighbor is a sex offender and my neighbor to the right has 3 little kids! Seems like they stick em everywhere  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Barn in the woods </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So when I was a little girl in rural east Texas (2nd grade) there was a mentally unstable older black man that would walk up and down the country roads and into town and back every so often. He had a sort of limp and talked to himself in an angry fashion. His head was always bobbing slightly. 

I felt sorry for him as he seemed to live nowhere and had no one to take care of him so sometimes I would bring home my school lunch in a bag or something and give it to him if I saw him near my grandmothers house. Nothing ever happened to me and he never bothered anyone.

Fast forward 9 years and nothing has changed. The guy is still walking around all crazy talking to himself, no one even notices him anymore. My friend Heather and I are running through the woods owned by her parents as she is training for the marines.

We go further into the woods than we've ever gone. We're not even on a path anymore just running into the night following the full moon. We aren't scared because nothing ever happens here. People leave cars unlocked at night ya know?

She stops suddenly when she sees an unknown trail tucked away across a creek. (Her parents don't have 4wheelers or anything just horses so it's weird to see a random trail.) So of course we have to check it out. We jog down the trail until we come to this old medium sized dilapidated grayish barn. So fucking random. But I love weird and creepy things so I'm like "let's check it out!" And she agrees excitedly. But our mood changes when we see a 4 wheeler parked on the opposite side of the barn. 

We go inside and it's clear someone is living in it. It smells like shit and piss. There are a shit ton of old porno magazines strewn about the ground and bags of personal stuff. Inside of one of the bags are children's clothing, some have blood stains. This all took around 10 minutes. I recoil immediately my blood running cold and whisper *we need to leave now, but Heather was already frozen in fear staring at the barn exit. 

"Someone is watching us crouched by the trees", she manages to say. She has a backpack on and luckily has a flashlight. Quickly thinking she flashes in his direction and in those 3 seconds I see an old black man with a 10 inch knife. 

We book it out of the other end and don't even look back. We hear the sound of him stating the 4 wheeler and just keep running. We know if we run an the direction we are in we will eventually come to the highway. So he loses us as there are no other trails and we make it out safe onto the road and run to her house. The run back took about 30-45 minutes at most. 

We tell her dad and he looks very disturbed and calls the police. Lo and behold it's the "crazy" old black guy I used to give my lunches to and he is in fact not crazy at all, doesn't even have a limp. He was a child rapist that had gotten out of prison in Louisiana about 15 years earlier and had been on the run since then hiding in East Texas. 

He wasn't crazy at all it was just an act so everyone would dismiss him and leave him alone. As for the bloody clothes, they belonged to 3 missing children whom he killed and buried out there.  </TEXT>
