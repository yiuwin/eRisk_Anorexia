	<TEXT> Please let me know where I said I was in an exclusive club? It was the fact that she approched me to give me her number. I never went out and asked her for it.  That's why I was sharing.  Most people dont automatically assume they are in some weird club because of a random event, clearly you wouldn't understand this since you dont understand much (sorry for assuming that you dont know much but your account name indicates so. Hopefully you didn't buy one.)

thanks for your input! </TEXT>

Sadly that's what the worst part of this is - from previous conversations we seemed REALLY compatible as far as preferences and likes/dislikes go. Oh well, I've been out of a relationship for quite a while now, might as well keep my journey going. Thanks for all the replies fellas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am so sorry to hear what had happened to you. You should not feel ashamed or disgusted with yourself. Your ex boyfriend is the low life loser who should feel disgusted.  All you can do is learn from your mistakes and filter out the bad influences, although it sounds like you already have. You do not need to admit it to your current boyfriend unless you want to, but if he truely cares for you he will stay with you and understand that everyone makes mistakes. You went through a rough time - thats life. Now its time to stay positive and continue on. Help other people out, if you can make one person smile then you're set. Smiles are contagious.  If you or anyone reading this ever needs to vent feel free to message me.
