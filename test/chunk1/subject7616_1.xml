	<TEXT> Didn't witness it, but the year before I got to highschool, some of the seniors snuck jars of crickets into the end of year assembly and released them.  Just a perfectly excecuted classic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Read this as one syllable "moped" instead of "mo-ped", and can't get the image of a bunch of criminals moping around, too sad to commit any crimes, leaving the London Police bored and concerned.  "Tougher tactics" include drive-by compliments and group therapy sessions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on how badly it broke.  Rinse it thrououghly to make sure there are no shards that'll fly off when you rip.  If you absolutely can't get a new bowlpiece and need to smoke, be careful and don't pull too hard (keep any glass shards from flying up outta the water).  But you really should just get a new bowlpiece. </TEXT>
