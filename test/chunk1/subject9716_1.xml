	<TEXT> a) Same here, but Facebook is the bigger minefield for me, and I have to use it at least once a day for professional reasons.

b) All Stars 2 was such a 180 on the whole format of the show that I can understand why fans were upset when (what I and many others saw as) less qualified contestants got farther in the competition. 

That said, the queens are almost always so humble, and simply grateful to be part of the legacy, that the fans really do make themselves look bad with all the #JusticeForX. But in a show about drag queens, shade is the name of the game, so it's not really surprising. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. /r/rupaulsdragrace does good episode recaps, but that's pretty much where the quality discussion ends. Many of the "fans" there like to cause drama and cut each other down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   Although I do feel that they wrapped it up in a way which was somewhat, anticlimactic really.

I was hoping someone else bring this up. It seemed like everybody came up with an off-the-cuff 11th hour solution to each of their problems. The fist bump was cute, but everything else just screamed "We need to wrap this up now!"

Which is disappointing, because Iris and Hope were being presented as a legitimate threat in the last issue and that went belly up just a few pages in. </TEXT>
