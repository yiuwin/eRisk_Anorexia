	<TEXT> I still think so. I don't think it's offensive to disagree about something like that. Though in this exact instance, I would say "you really don't remind me too much of that character, you're so nice and he is such a jerk" or whatever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TV shows. If you know someone watches the same show as you, it's a great subject. It's impersonal because you are talking about fictional characters or people you don't really know but there is still a lot to talk about. For example: "Did you see the bachelor this week? I can't believe what Olivia said to Amanda about being a 'teen mom'. Do you think Ben will send her home next week?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Are you ok?" 

In the USA strangers only ask that if you're CLEARLY not ok (i.e. puffy red eyes from crying). When a passerby asked me that I was worried I looked sick or terribly sad. Later learned that is like "how are you?" to them. Weird.  </TEXT>
