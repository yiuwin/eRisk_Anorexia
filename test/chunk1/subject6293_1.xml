	<TEXT> I'm listening to my [MA-350's](http://www.amazon.com/RHA-MA-350-Aluminium-Isolating-Earphones/dp/B0053R0WWG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1350511516 sr=8-1 keywords=ma+350) right now. I've had them for almost a month.
 
A wire "kinked" out of the braided cord, but that shouldn't be a problem for long because from what I hear RHA has excellent costumer service (all of their products come witha a three year warranty). The audio is good, but if find them a bit too bright at times, but it's gotten better over time. The isolation is the best I've experienced. I would easily recommend these for their price.  </TEXT>
