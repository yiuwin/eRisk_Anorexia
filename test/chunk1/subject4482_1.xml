I'm sure looking forward to people posting  "shitty draft" screenshots. Have fun. </TEXT>

Honestly, in specific situations, treating them differently is the appropriate choice of action.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I seldom have time to play during the weekdays; weekends are the time I am free to play dota all day long if I want to. But teammates are so noticeably horrible on weekends, I'd like to believe that I'm looking too much into it but the trend has been true. I can win +25 or +50 each day from Monday to Friday and lose it all on a Saturday. Thus, I stopped playing ranked on weekends. Mostly messed around in normal games but that's honestly pretty lame.

Which comes to my point: this probably can't be helped but it's really stupid; weekends are the only time I can spend time and play seriously (which is the attitude people clicking ranked *should* be having), improve myself, etc. but I end up having to restrain myself lest I get uncooperative, selfish, egoistic teammates, that rarely appear in weekdays but are everywhere in weekends, that throw my game and MMR for me? That's utter bullshit from my perspective.

Making things worse, the friend I like to play with most can only play on weekends, so we've basically been dropping a hell lot of party MMR. Not that it matters a lot but it feels awful and bitter to lose because some asshole decides to play anyhow or "experiment" in ranked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Anti Mage:** Summons an allied Faceless Void whose power is based on the amount of missing mana of the target for a duration.

**Sniper:** Adds an additional ability: Brotherhood. An assassin will pop out of a tree nearest to the target, traveling at 522ms towards said target and will kill him upon contact. The assassin can be killed before reaching his target.

**Bounty Hunter:** Tracked units will now leave footprints in their paths until track expires.

**Troll Warlord:** All stats and abilities are replaced with those of the 6.83 patch.

**Ember Spirit:** Can use Activate Fire Remnant on ground; no longer requires remnants. Activate Fire Remnant now costs mana while traveling and deals damage based on distance traveled. Fire remnants in its path will explode and deal damage.

**Slardar:** Amplified unit gets a nicer model.

**Kunkka:** Upon the Ghost Ship crashing, triggers the anger of Tidehunter, who will ravage at crash location.

**Tidehunter:** Ravage will now also toss Kunkka's Ghost Ship in the air, which will crash down on the ravage's AoE.

**Lycan:** Adds a new ability: Summon Feral Rats. Feral Rats deal extra damage to buildings and non-hero units and take extra damage from heroes.

**Shadow Fiend:** Souls released will become units under Shadow Fiend's control for a duration.

**Phantom Assassin:** Increase crit chance to 17%.

**Clinkz:** Can now target friendly heroes.

**Medusa:** Adds new ability: Plant Mirror. Plants a mirror that can reflect Medusa's gaze. Plant Mirror is charge based.

**Storm Spirit:** Reduced cooldown.

**Oracle:** Can cast on enemy to instantly kill the target but revives him after the duration of the spell at his death location.

**Dragon Knight:** Increases all damage towards dragons by 2x; Dragon Tail does not require turning to cast; When Dragon Knight kills a dragon during Elder Dragon Form, he will absorb its soul and permanently gain bonus stats.

	<TITLE> Countering a farmed Alchemist </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-29 02:40:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Contrary to popular belief, things like picking AA or getting burst damage dealers aren't the best or most reliable answer to defeating Alchemist.

While Ice Blast certainly makes Alchemist unable to tank, he can simply run off and still deal damage through radiance. On top of that, it doesn't last long enough to have much of an impact without Aghs and it's a skillshot nonetheless. Also not to mention that AA is squishy and can't really stay within radiance range. Having said these, AA is nowhere near a bad pick against Alchemist; he's just not as magical a counter as most people think of him.

As for burst damage, you have to really make sure to kill Alchemist off in one shot. If not he'll just run away with low HP with his fast movement speed, which happens most of the time.

So here are the counters I propose: Dazzle and/or a hard lockdown. Whenever you're about to fight, just weave Alchemist. That discourages him from rushing up front and, the best part is, the more he hesitates, the worse for his situation since the armor reduction builds up over time. For the most part, Alchemist seems to be able to tank because of the crazy AoE damage over time and debuffs (miss chance from radiance, armor reduction from acid spray and maybe also AC), which causes his enemies to die they can deal fatal damage to him. That is where shallow grave comes in - 5 more seconds of survival for your carry/ damage dealer is invaluable to take down Alchemist. Even better if you manage to keep him alive after grave.

A hard lockdown is far more reliable than a burst. It keeps Alchemist in position, not able to do anything actively while you throw everything at him. Shadow Shaman and Windrunner are good choices, though shackleshot is also a skillshot (I keep putting emphasis on skillshot because it's not good to take chances against alchemist). Of course, this is provided you have a painful right clicker on your team (Windrunner herself is one). </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Is your skill level before MMR and during calibration still very heavily dependent on hero damage?

I created a smurf several days ago and have been winning a significant majority of the matches. I played support almost all the time and by the second or third day I noticed that I've been matched with players at 4.8k - 5k. However, I am still consistently winning most games but noticed that I'm getting matched with 3.8k - 4.3k people now. Only sometimes do I see 5k people and that is probably because there's another guy with say 3.3k MMR.

Should I change the role and/or heroes I play? I mean, I don't want to end up calibrating barely over 4k (or worse still below it). But then again, people seldom pick support, don't ward as much and as appropriately as I do, so I still feel more comfortable supporting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lost 6 solo ranked in a row, won the 7th game just now and we *barely* won.

[dotabuff link](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/73125622/matches?date= hero= skill_bracket= lobby_type=ranked_matchmaking game_mode= region= faction= duration= enjoyment=any timezone=Asia%2FSingapore) (The top 7 games, excluding the Jakiro game because that was party ranked)

Let's just say for the record, I seldom play by myself, and solo ranked had been a cancer of an experience for these 7 games. It's either there's just that *one* guy trashtalking and doing shit or, worse still, the whole team having no coordination and nobody else seem like they want to do something about it. Oh and before I forget, almost all of these 7 games I have teammates that disconnect from time to time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Breakdown of each game from my perspective:

**UNDYING GAME 1**: 

First thing into the game the Magnus says "afk 5 min". Then comes back after he lost a shit ton of gold (he was the last pick) and randomed Magnus. Then he laned top with me, contesting last hits from me; don't want to be support.

The rest of the team were actually doing well, but this asshole simply doesn't want to contribute by buying wards, leaving ES poor as fuck. Then he farms a dagger when we already lost a couple of teamfights. AND THEN either saves his RP or fail them. And then he trashtalks and we lose. The end.

**UNDYING GAME 2**:

I shut down AM from farming during laning phase, BS is getting kills, we are winning - looks like a won game. That idea was further reinforced by the fact that rubick was really good, stealing blackholes and stuff, winning us clashes. THEN lina disconnects for good, leaving us 4v5, BS tries to hunt AM but for whatever reason decide to chase other heroes and get killed *by AM*, giving him lots of gold back. And that's not just it, rubick then says he is lagging 500+ ping so he can't help us, resulting in a 3v5. So AM just got ridiculously fat and we can't fight the rest of his team either. We lose, the end.

**DAZZLE GAME**:

First or second pick Necro, then goes to farm ancients. For whatever bloody reason the Tiny last pick Tiny for mid. Laning phase was still okay, then after that the enemy team started rotating and we die several times. Tiny still doesn't want to stick; goes off alone to kill, sometimes killing sometimes dying. Team seems to be utterly confused so I commanded us to stick and push, but Tiny wants to be stubborn for whatever bloody reason again. Then he babyrages in voice chat most of the time and quickly lost. The end.

**VENGEFUL GAME**:

Got pretty fed up at this point and just randomed VS. Nothing wrong, I'll just support. Axe goes jungle. We got punished for greedy lineup. We lost, the end.

**STORM SPIRIT GAME**:

At this point I'm just like fuck everything and so took storm to go mid. This was by far the most cancerous game - I was watching omni a lot at top and he have TOTALLY NO BLOODY IDEA what he was doing. I forgot the details about the rest of this game but basically we had no 0 teamwork. Juggernaut and slark seem like they only knew how to solo kill, when the enemy allow for it, that is. And yes this slark doesn't want to rush in with shadow dance for the rest of us to follow up, so there's that for teamfights as well. Basically we lost, the end.

**BRISTLEBACK GAME 1**:

I decide that I'm just going to pick an offlane that will have a presence in fights and lategame because the level of distrust in me towards my team is crazy high at this point. So, with nobody wanting to pick early, I picked BB. Then the rest pick and look - only Winter Wyvern support, *as expected*. 

We were actually winning pretty hard earlygame; I thought that I can finally fucking win. THEN this slardar for some bloody reason decided to not stick with the team anymore and then causing the rest of us to die in disadvantages fight. He then uses childish retorts (including "your mom") when confronted about it. And he builds VANGUARD. WTF. To make things worse, the Tiny turned out to be no better and the sniper frequently disconnected and ultimately abandoned. At least the Winter Wyvern was good, but what can 2 man do? Lol. So we lost, the end.

**BRISTLEBACK GAME 2**:

Guess what? I got teamed with the Tiny and Sniper from the previous game. Thanks, Valve. So AS USUAL, people don't want to pick first, and when we need a support, the last guy picks clockwerk and contests farm with me at bottom. And guess who the clockwerk is? Bloody Tiny. Except he kept his mouth shut this whole game, and more useless. Thankfully, the Silencer rekt mid and ganked and rekt, so he might just be the saving grace for our team. 

But, well, eventually Silencer couldn't do it all on his own anymore, and ended up dying a lot trying to solo kill. Meanwhile, we have a clock casually farming while we teamfight and a drow desperately jungling. In other words, 3v5. Eventually the enemy team got really farmed and took a rax, pretty much looked like it was over.

Then under some strange, but thankful, turn of events, drow was melting them in teamfights and we just won from that, after a huge disadvantage in all areas. So here ends my solo ranked losing streak, but even then it was a cancer-filled struggle. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

**OVERALL ANALYSIS**:

* Everyone wants to last pick, but it's almost always the last pick screwing up the linup.
* It's a miracle if I have 2 supports in my team, at least I always have one even if it's me, I guess?
* Almost every game I have people on my team disconnecting. It's like Valve wants to fuck me in the ass.
* The enemy team always have such good teamwork while my team is a mess even if I try to load, though we're all solo. Why the heck?
* Elaborating on the above point, it really only takes one asshole to lose a game. Sure, I can have 3 others working together, but 4-man teamwork vs 5-man teamwork? Take a guess which wins. 
* Although this is anecdotal: It's not like the enemy team never has incompetent people, but it's always just 1 guy while the rest of the team are really winning the game. In contrast, I almost *never* have people standing out; passively farming, no idea what to do, etc. It feels like I'm playing an RPG where allies are for show; I'm *supposed* to win quests and shit all by myself. But RPGs are designed that way, this is 5 real people vs 5 real people. How the fuck am I supposed to do that? </TEXT>

Name as in their proper names, exclusive of their titles.

Examples:

* Genderless thunder goddess with plots (Kushra = Elsel = Elsel = Ronel = Griel)
* Ice Castle (Copra = Tesla = Oulu = Zeldeus)
* Fat Nature Dragon (Vael = Farvnil = Ragshelm = Ragzaberam)

Seems weird to me and their lores don't mention the name changes. Also, it was only today that I realised that this "Zeldeus" people are talking all about is actually referring to 7* Oulu.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> While I am obviously not playing at the same level as those professional teams, Necrolyte has been a monster for me in games. He is my trusted go-to hero to utterly shut down meta picks like leshrac, storm spirit, gyrocopter, spirit breaker, or really just any hero I don't want alive.

Even in TI5, a huge problem I've seen is teams not being able to finish off a hero fast enough and that punished them really hard. Necrolyte basically solves that problem with a single R press. Not to mention in sustained team fights (which is how I describe the current meta), Necrolyte's heal+nuke comes and handy and his aura just, you know, does its work.

While there are problems with the hero that discourages picking it like awful mobility and the lack of disable (other than ultimate), I'm very surprised that nobody even gave him a try. At all. It feels like I'm missing out on something extremely terrible about Necrolyte.

So do you actually bother to put a squad to win defensively, be it you're a sadist, overly competitive or some other reasons? </TEXT>

For me, it's Kotaro's Lightning Dribble. Dribbling so fast that your opponent's can't defend against your drive and/or steal the ball from you? LOL! And better yet, each finger adding more speed to the dribbling. He must have 6 packs on each finger, hmm, maybe 8 packs on his pinkie and 12 packs on his thumb!

And I guess I should also mention that you've gotta be lucky enough to have already pulled a 7 star available unit, at least currently

And also, 70 energy seems a lot. Or at least it is when it's so difficult to clear as well. Though, this might as well be a very biased opinion because I'm stuck with 6* units. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a person who's personally against spending near a thousand on a phone, I'm very curious to know in-depth about OTG and why only high-end phones, in general, support OTG. Googling helped with close to nothing so I decided to post here.


I presume it's not about technology while being about hardware since there are new models with android 4.0 and up that don't support OTG.


It's a little disappointing to find out that my phone doesn't support OTG. While it isn't a major feature (I guess), it's extremely useful to have it to me. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Why don't manufacturers (Samsung) simply make all of their devices support OTG?


Anyway, the story behind me asking this is because I bought the Samsung Galaxy A3 this February and I'm pretty satisfied with it for its price. Soon after the purchase, I thought about buying a portable amplifier and that's when I came to know about OTG and how you can use a DAC on a phone through OTG. I did some research on it but there weren't any definite answers about OTG support; Only stuff like "if your device is Android 4.0 and up it SHOULD support OTG out of the box", so I assumed it applies to my A3.


So obviously that's not the case (I realised) after I plugged in my newly bought DAC + Amp to my phone. Only after that did I do deeper research to find out that many phones, like the Samsung A and E series, do not support OTG despite being Android 4.0 and up.
So why don't they just make them support OTG? From my understanding OTG support is a hardware thing, so is it expensive to give a device OTG support or something?


Also, is there any way at all to make my phone support OTG? Would be great to be able to use DAC with my phone. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-14 06:32:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In DotA LoD, each player gets a small pool of heroes to choose abilities from for 3minutes (to clarify, each player on a team have a different pool of heroes but both teams have the same 5 pools). Then they pick the actual hero to use with their chosen abilities.

**What playing DotA LoD back then taught me:**

* Base stats and stat growth (str, agi int) of every hero. 
* Other important info like attack range, base attack time, movement speed, attack animation, cast time, etc. of every hero.
* Be creative with the options you have. 

Basically, stuff that would make me a better player in actual DotA.

**What Ability Draft taught me:**

* If I get thrown a low int hero I'll have to get carry-friendly abilities even if I came up with a brilliant combo with the available abilities, since building as a caster/support is out of the question.
* Pray that the other 9 players don't pick what you want.
* Pick abilities for the sake of denying the enemy a strong combo.
* That I am not supposed to communicate with my team on drafting. Why else would there not be a chat window right?
* That I cannot be too smart at denying enemy picks lest they abandon and waste 10mins of my life and my good draft. 

Basically, they took what was intended to be a fun mode and made it a semi-competitive semi-joke mode that is hardly fun and laughter. Worse still, you learn **nothing** beneficial to the standard game, as opposed to DotA LoD.

TL;DR: I'm proposing to completely change this draft format of AD into something at least similar to the wc3 DotA LoD mod. Agree? Disagree? Discuss. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-09 05:51:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since the reporting (low priority) and commendation systems apparently haven't been effective all the while in improving the community, I'd like to suggest giving players their own blacklist and whitelist.

Players can add people to their blacklist and doing so makes it that they will never be matched with said people **on their team**. Each person has a limited number of space on their blacklist. Unlike reporting, a person can add whoever and whenever they want into the blacklist. People on your blacklist will be highlighted to you should you see them anywhere (in game, lobby, party, guild, etc.)

Likewise, players can add whoever and whenever they want on their whitelist as well, except it won't affect matchmaking. It also highlights your whitelisted people to you should you see them. The whitelist works in a different manner: The number of people who whitelists you will be shown on your profile and stuff as a replacement to commendations.

**Note:** I am not suggesting that the blacklist replaces the report system (and low priority) but I am indeed suggesting the whitelist to replace the commend system.

This is just a concept and a brief description of it. Feel free to put out your views, suggestions and/or point out loopholes and possible exploits using such a system.

**EDIT: Immediately after posting this almost everyone's response was that it's going to prolong queue time and ban everyone = ez mmr**. However, these are actually points that I had considered even before deciding to post this.

Firstly, it **SHOULD NOT** prolong queue time because if you get matched with someone in your blacklist, said person is simply put on the other team. If said person is blacklisted by multiple people in the same game, then said multiple people will all be on the other team. Unless everyone bans everyone else indiscriminately, there won't be noticeable effects on matchmaking, and that's where the **LIMITED SPACE** comes in. I'd also like to further point out that the longer queue time argument has honestly just been a hypothesis.

Secondly, regarding "ez mmr", it doesn't work that way. Let's say you ban everyone you know at your skill bracket, there's no knowing if you'll get matched in a higher skill or lower skill match afterwards. Let's say it's a higher skill match, there are still 2 rough outcomes: your team carry you to victory; you drag your team down. Likewise, if it's a lower skill match, it's either you carry your team to victory or your team dragging you down. So in the end it's just a gamble; **you can do it, but at your own risk**. Also don't forget **LIMITED SPACE**.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 2: Ok here's a better way to explain how the blacklist will work.

If it's implemented, it's just there. As a feature. An optional feature. No obligations to use it. It's just there for you should you feel that it'll benefit you. If not, simply don't use it. That way, the only way the blacklist system is going to affect you is if **others blacklist you**, and, if that's the case, then it seems like the problem lies with you, unfortunately.

At least I feel it gives you an **option**; use it if you're willing to wait longer for potentially non-toxic team mates; don't use it if you don't want to wait and don't mind a potentially toxic team. Until someone comes up with something better, this is honestly what I see as an effective compromise.

And I'd like to emphasise: **IT'S OPTIONAL.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was walking home when it started to rain and I had to cross a traffic light (not sheltered obviously). As comical as it sounds, I slipped and fell on the concrete path and it hurt, so I was limping after I got up. Then the rain started to get pretty heavy and the traffic light turned green; I certainly wouldn't want to wait for the next green man under the downpour, especially at a crossroad. So I limped as quickly as I could across the road and eventually reached shelter. And right at that moment the rain reduced to a drizzle and stopped after a couple minutes.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Blacklist System </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-31 06:45:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Players should be allowed to add people to a blacklist, with limited space, to never have them **on their team** through matchmaking. The blacklisted person will be shown to you. No restrictions to who you can blacklist and why - toxicity, no communication, bad internet, or simply because you think he sucks at your level.

**Justifications/Reasons:**

*  It shouldn't hurt matchmaking because, let's say a blacklisted guy is put in the same game, he will simply be assigned on the other team. If a game has multiple people who blacklisted that same guy, either have said people all on the same team or re-matchmake the players.

* Prevents game dodging. No reason to dodge when that "toxic" guy isn't on your team. Better still, he's now on the enemy team, so either win to prove that you're not wrongly accusing him or lose and do some self-reflection.

* More reliable than reporting (and getting someone in low priority). Report obviously requires criteria to fairly judge if the reported players deserve to be sent to LP, which honestly isn't even a big deal. 

* To continue on being better than reporting, it also saves the trouble of refining the report system to better judge a reported player; and even then such a system can never be perfect. Blacklist, on the other hand, does not require any judging whatsoever, or rather, the judging is done by each and every individual. Said "judgement" also doesn't outright condemn (punish) the targeted person, so even if one blacklists another simply out of spite, it's totally fine. In fact, that's what would make the system work - how you genuinely feel towards a person; your opinion. 

* A passive-aggressive system like this may finally be something productive towards a toxic-free community. If you punish someone (LP) for something wrong he did, that doesn't mean he's definitely gonna learn or repent, genuinely try to be a better person. However, if you simply leave him be but indirectly show him that everyone sees him as an asshole, he might reconsider for his own image and whatnot.

* Potentially less usage of the mute system. Okay, first of all this is quite an assumption. The thing is, the mute system is flawed because it totally cuts off communication but it is still a needed feature. So this is just something that I'd like to point out, without much basis.

* Blacklisting and being blacklisted can be seen as a win-win situation. Many times toxicity isn't a one sided thing, it's two or more parties being toxic at each other. So in this case, you'd gladly be blacklisted by the other party anyway. 

**Considerations:**

* The blacklist system may be used to help in better determining reports as well, but this then likely gives a reason to exploit the blacklist.

* You may also be able to view who/the number of people who blacklisted you. This may actually contribute to treating the toxicity within players (as funny as it sounds) - toxic players will never see themselves being in the wrong, thus they would spam blacklist all the players that had flame wars with him. Then one day he sees the long list of players he has blacklisted, along with another pile of players who blacklisted him. HOPEFULLY, that has a psychological impact on him and changes his attitude.

* Maybe you can't find a match if you have someone you blacklisted on your party as well. I know people who find strangers to stack with or friend inviting friend's friend and stuff like that so this will apply in such scenarios. Rather have awkwardness and talk things out before finding a match than having a conflict in one.    </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A literally unfair bot mode? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-28 23:34:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think it would be interesting to have a bot mode/difficulty that is literally unfair; superhuman bots. Features for the bots include:

* **All-out maphack** - Smoke / invis gank? Runs back to safety until the coast is clear. Jungling / alone / taking roshan? Prepare to get hunted down. Pro juke? Sorry, perfect "prediction" here. Also knows where your wards are and will try to deward them. Zeus bot? Have fun: the moment your HP is low enough to be killed by his ulti (after calculations that the bot can obviously do), he'll send you to heaven. 
* **Perfect dodge** - Will 100% attempt to dodge skillshots (of course, if he is stunned in place or something then he can't dodge). Good luck with techies.
* **Perfect reflex** - I think this is already implemented but if it's not, I'm talking about 100% disjoint skills using abilities e.g. manta style to dodge any form of damage or debuff; instant BKB activation. Also instantly (restricted only by technology) disables you e.g. you try to blink in and echo but your fingers are too slow for the bots to get the echo off after blinking.
* **Perfect micro** - bots being bots will be able to micro perfectly; have fun against perfect Chen creeps chain disables, perfect primal split, perfect necronomicon control, etc. Also perfect armlet and treads toggling.

and to spice things up even more (if it's not challenging enough):

* **RNGesus' Blessing** - increased proc rate of everything for the bots. Trying to run? Get perma bashed. Think you can tank? Let PA crit on you 3 times in a row. You caught out FV? Let him backtrack all your nukes. Enemy Ogre Magi? 4x multicast all day. Mjollnir on enemy? Zaps more times than Zeus bangs women.

I can see it as a for-fun PvE challenge, much like the holiday events except there isn't anything completely new that has to be made from scratch (and also available all year long). What do you guys think?    </TEXT>

	<TITLE> my method of clearing trial X2 (Taunt Spam) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-28 17:19:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just thought I'd share a method I came up with for Trial X2. The units used are pretty specific for it to work, though. This is also my first time trying to make a guide of some sort.

*EDIT: I realised that Ushi had already done a Ultor taunt-spam single-squad clear video :/ Fortunately (sort of) for me, it doesn't entirely render this guide useless because it looks like Ushi's method also requires a Colossal Tridon. So if you only have Ultor you can still make use of this :) but if you have Tridon as well I think it's better to follow Ushi.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**SQUAD 1:**

* **Kagamine Rin (LEADER):** Nullify ailments is a must, BC boost and HP rec helps a lot. SBB is highly recommended. I mean, Rin is strong as hell anyway.
* **Cyclopean Ultor**  Definitely a must since my method is centered around him.
* **Guardian Darvanshel** Any mitigator who attacks on top of mitigating will do i.e. Shera works too, Narza is not recommended.
* **Alpha Tree Altri** Any healer will do, I think.
* **Netherking Hadaron** Any strong single target BB/SBB unit will do, just that I used Hadaron.
* **Tyrant Lilly Matah (FRIEND)** Her LS is a must as well.

(Obviously, you can have Matah as your leader and Rin as friend instead)

**SQUAD 2:**

* Should just be a backup squad. Would be good to replicate Squad 1 (the roles) as much as possible.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Items:**

Fujin (must) / Revive Item (obviously important) / Cure / High Cure / Divine or Holy Light (yeah just spam them heals)

**First Encounter: Fennia (Thunder) + Cayena (Fire) + Lico (Dark)**

* Basically follow a 3-turn cycle all the way against them (of course, mitigate and/or guard for the skills that activate at certain HP thresholds, then resume)

* Aim Fennia first, followed by Cayena and lastly Lico. Lico's **Dark Impact** every turn might seem pain at first, but it's honestly easier to manage than the other two. Fennia uses **Voltage Storm** every 3 turns which does AoE damage and REMOVES ALL BUFFS so that's a pain in the ass. Why you'd want to leave Lico for last is because of **Death Strike** replacing **Dark Impact** after 50% HP. It damages for a whopping 80% of max HP, so you're gonna get f***ed if she isn't the only one attacking you.

**Warning:** Keep track of all 3 of their HPs every turn. even with target Fennia only and one single target BB, it's still likely that you'd bring the HP of the others down to 70% before you kill Fennia, so if you didn't see that coming you'll be screwed hard.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**The 3-Turn Cycle**

* **PRE-TURN 1:** (At the very start of the battle) Fujin Ultor. Set to targeting Fennia only.

* **TURN 1:** Use Ultor's SBB, attack with the rest, guarding any low HP unit if you want to be super safe.

*(With Taunt casted, all 3 will attack Ultor, filling his BB guage to the brim thanks to Matah LS. Keep Ultor's HP high with all the cures, especially in the early rounds. Try to save healing BBs for when all units need heal.)*

* **TURN 2:** Do the same as TURN 1 (and watch the magic)

* **TURN 3:** Guard ALL units. **Do not use mitigate** as buff removal removes the mitigate buff.


**Notes:**

* Be generous with cures on Ultor early in the battle.
* Good to guard your healer almost all the time if not healing.
* Not necessary to save mitigate for TURN 3. Not a bad idea to use it along with healer using BB to ensure that healer won't die.
* If you happen to lose your momentum (which IS very likely), either guard all for 1 turn (to fill up BB gauge) or use your second Fujin on Ultor again so he can taunt. (Maintaining the taunt spam is important in keeping the rest of your team alive)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**% HP THRESHOLD SKILLS**

Note: can't say I'm 100% right about every skill, but I'm pretty sure I'm right. :P

**FENNIA:** 

* HP 70%   30%: Guard and mitigate if possible.
* HP 50%: Self buff; no need to guard and mitigate. Will begin to cast an AoE every turn, so take caution.

**CAYENA:**

* When Fennia Dies: AoE + remove buffs every 2 turns. Guard all. **Do not mitigate.**
* 70% and 30%: Guard and mitigate if possible. Full BB drain.
* 50%: Self buff as well, begins to cast **Homing Rockets** (single target) on every turn instead of every 2 turns.

**LICO:**

* When Fennia dies: 25% mitigation and status immunity buff to Cayena and herself that lasts all the way. 
* When Cayena dies: Ignore DEF chance buff to herself that also lasts all the way. 
* 70% and 30%: Massive damage on single target. Make sure all units are at high HP, cast mitigate and guard the rest, hopefully no one dies. 
* 50%: another self buff as well. Also replaces **Dark Impact** with **Death Strike**, but at this point you should be able to easily taunt spam her to death (Highly recommended to taunt every single turn and simply keep Ultor alive with heals and mitigation at all cost)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


And that's it for the first battle. You should still have all your units alive (taking into account revives), but it should be okay if you have one dead. The second battle is relatively easier.
