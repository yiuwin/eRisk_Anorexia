"You're hot so everything else about you must be great."

"It's not your fault that guys constantly 'hump your leg', but my feelings for you are totally your fault and you need to take responsibility by validating them and accepting that we're a good match despite neither of us knowing the other."

"You're a whore because you're blonde and wear makeup."

"I guess if another girl came along that was hotter I'd go for her instead. But still, you should give me a chance!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a South Park reference, based on Chef's dad getting stalked by the Loch Ness Monster in strange situations and asking for the $3.50 that he is owed. Reddit "tree-fiddy" stories are all about setting up an interesting premise related to the thread, then revealing at the end that one of the major participants was actually the Loch Ness Monster the whole time and the redditor only realized it after he asked for his "tree-fiddy". This is typically followed by cries of anguish from those who were taken in by the story and emotionally invested in the outcome, only to have the whole thing revealed to be a farce and a set up for the joke. 

A similar technique is the "Bel Air", where the redditor starts telling a story, then abruptly switches to the "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" theme song. A good segue is important so it seems to flow naturally from the first part of the story.

There is also a technique that dictates a situation from the perspective of a famous character without revealing the fact that it is not a personal story. Details are omitted or reworded so that it seems relevant to the thread and plausible that it occurred in someone's real life, and ideally the only time the audience realizes that it is actually a story about a famous character is when they get to the last line. I'm not sure if this technique has its own name or if it's considered a subset of the "Bel Air". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have knowingly committed a mortal sin, you should not present yourself to receive the Eucharist. The Church's position on abortion is clear and widely spread. There is no room for interpretation here. They knowingly dismiss the views of the Church in favor of those that appeal to the world. To say that they are in communion with the Church by receiving the Eucharist is a blatant lie, so every time they receive they are further committing a mortal sin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll do you one better. I was hanging out in my friends' room in the dorm when their boyfriends both came to visit. One girl left the room with her boyfriend and I hung out for a while. I then thought to myself, "She almost never sees her boyfriend - they must have left to give them space!" 

I then went down to the basement and found the other couple and hung out with them for a while, proud of myself that I had finally picked up a hint when I almost never do. Found out later that the original couple had left so THEY could get space, and I was accidentally intruding on them. Plus the girl still in the room wasn't sure if everyone was coming back so they wound up not doing anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Glad to help. I was in favor of the Stormcloaks from the beginning of the game, too. I was all about the freedom fighting. I knew that I'd have to choose one side over the other, so I put it off. As I traveled Skyrim, I saw how the nationalist Stormcloaks had been oppressing the Dunmer in Windhelm, and I knew that if they won the rest of Skyrim would follow suit. They might tolerate non-Nord humans, but the other races would be driven out. They're about as much for racial purity as the Thalmor. 

They also don't exactly respect the religious freedom of the Forsworn, or Nords that follow the old ways, so it seems hypocritical to complain about not being allowed to worship Talos. I'm in favor of letting them all worship anything they want, and the only faction on that boat is the more cosmopolitan Empire. Finding that secret dossier just sealed the deal. Either way, the Aldmeri Dominion wants the rebellion to continue so ending it in favor of either faction hurts them.

I'm not too happy that the Black-Briars now control Riften, or that the nitwit leader of Falkreath is still in power, but no situation is perfect. Besides...accidents happen. Especially when you lead the Thieves' Guild and Dark Brotherhood... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, you find out in a secret missive that Ulfric was at one time just a Thalmor pawn. They consider him an asset that can be reclaimed later when it's convenient. The rebellion tied up resources for the Empire and Skyrim, so it was beneficial to the Aldmeri Dominion from the start. Ending it with a unified Empire is the best first step toward the destruction of the Thalmor, even if it means giving them a foothold in the immediate sense.

I've spent way too long planning on overthrowing the Aldmeri Dominion. I wouldn't mind the Empire falling - all empires fall eventually, if only it weren't being replaced by racists who oppress religious freedom. I've already got a plan in place where the Dragonborn marries Laila Law-Giver after winning the people's trust and basically becoming the head of everything ever. Since the Emperor's throne is up for grabs thanks to the Dark Brotherhood, it makes sense that much like Tiber Septim, the throne should pass to one with dragon lineage. Since he'll also be the High King of Skyrim, this will unify the Empire further. 

I'm hoping Bethesda releases DLC where we can take back some parts of the Empire from the Aldmeri Dominion, eventually overthrowing them. In the meantime, I'll have to content myself with executing groups of Justiciars that roam Skyrim. And collecting Thalmor robes. 

...I take this far too seriously... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It can be good to share some experiences with them if it helps them relate to you or it contributes to the class material. Just make sure the sharing is done on your terms. Don't let them sidetrack the class and dictate when you start talking about personal things. If you really want to share, tell them that you'll end a couple of minutes before the bell so they can ask one or two burning questions. Just always make sure it's on your terms. You need to control the flow and pace of the class, not have it dictated by students. Otherwise they'll take every chance they can to sidetrack you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Best advice I can give is to be hardline on all important rules. Decide what you're going to give detentions or other punishments for before classes begin (talk to other teachers in your school/department to see what they do), and STICK TO IT. Do not compromise, do not listen to cajoling or wheedling. Become known as "that teacher". The kids who like to push the envelope and make life miserable for other kids in the class will complain and not like you at first, but in the long run they'll respect you much more if they know you're a reliable adult who sticks to his or her guns. They want classes where they can walk all over the teacher, but in the end they just see teachers like that as weak and don't take them seriously. 

Whatever you do, don't arbitrarily increase and decrease your level of strictness to compensate for your own feeling of losing control of the class. Neither the well-behaved or misbehaving students like or respect a teacher that is inconsistent, and they will make your class heck for it. Once you let things slide, the students see it as a weakness and jump on it, and it becomes that much harder to punish people for it in the future, until they find the next small thing they can get away with. Eventually you can't even punish the big infractions because it's gone too far. 

Of course, you need to make sure your administration is behind you. At that original school, students would have 45 detentions by the end of the year and not go to any, and they'd still pass them on to the next grade. Not much incentive to hand out punishments. Call or email parents right away. You might get lucky and they'll be involved, otherwise they might be just disconnected from their kids' lives altogether. If that happens, make up punishments, if the school allows it. Have them stay after school and copy Chaucer or something equally mind-numbing, and if they don't go it'll affect their grade. 

Once they realize that it's too much trouble to act out they'll avoid it. If you keep them after school (or after class) try to figure out what makes them act the way they do. Ask what is inspiring the behavior and if they realize how it affects the class. High school kids especially are used to being treated more like prisoners than people you can talk to, so that sometimes helps. What'll really sour things is the totally disconnected ones, who don't care about school, family, or the consequences you can provide. They know you can't hit them or physically force them to go to their room or take away their phones, so they don't respect any consequences you can actually offer. That's one of the reasons I like working at a private school (the first was public). Parents aren't going to drop lots of money on a school and then not pay attention when their kid is mucking it up.

Honestly after 4 years classroom management and sticking to my guns are still the hardest things for me. Teaching doesn't play to many of my natural strengths as I'm a rather laid-back, non-assertive person without much of an authoritative attitude. Knowing when to give a verbal correction, when to move closer to a student to try and make them aware they're doing something wrong, when to simply look at them, and when to provide tangible consequences is an art I have yet to master. Realize this, and realize that your first year of teaching will almost certainly drain you to your core. This is true to a smaller degree if it's your first year at a new school, even if you've taught a while.

Oh, and never tell them it's your first year. Above all, act like you know what you're doing and you've seen it all before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TL;DR   I ramble a whole freaking lot when I write, but a former student found me on Facebook after I left the school and propositioned me. I turned her down as gently as I could.

Awkward as anything to write about, but there seems to be a shortage of actual teachers' stories on here. 

So I was starting my teaching career at the age of 26, though I looked around 17 or so. Taught at a public high school and made pretty much every rookie teacher mistake ever, but learned a lot. The school (justifiably in my opinion) didn't rehire me but I went to a new school and used that experience to become a decent (or at least less useless) teacher at a new school.

Now, while I was working at the first school I had figured that I dodged any "hot for teacher" bullets. Didn't pick up any vibes and I have a hard enough time attracting women in my own age range, so I figured it wouldn't be much of a problem. I was also only teaching freshmen, which seemed like too young for any of those kinds of problems. It was more the guys who wanted to be my buddy (or my "bro", depending on the douchiness quotient). One even invited me to his birthday party over the summer when he found out I wasn't coming back. Yeah, I was having none of that. 

Fast-forward a year and a few months when I'm teaching at my new school, and I get a random Facebook message from one of the girls that used to be in my class. Now, I hadn't gotten any hints from this girl as far as I was aware. She and one of her friends came for extra help like 3 or 4 times total through the year, but they also legitimately needed the help to pass, so I didn't think anything of it. They knew some things from my life because I made the rookie teacher mistake of answering basically all questions about my personal life. I also knew a few things about these girls from their conversations after school, and the one that later messaged me asked me for advice a couple of times. I liked to think I was being helpful; hopefully I was.

But I get this random message out of nowhere. It has no preamble, just a direct "You're hot. I'm hot. Let's f***." at the start. I chuckle a bit, thinking it's a spambot hacking her account. But then the message details included my math class and how she was frequently thinking about....other things instead of what I was teaching. So I'm a bit flabbergasted and not sure how to respond. I also know she's been burned by boyfriends and has a bad relationship with her father, so I want to not only turn her down, but also convince her to maybe stick with guys her own age rather than winding up with some creepy older guy who will actually take her up on the offer. 

So I try to brush it off and refuse, but she thinks I'm playing hard to get, and goes into great detail about what she'd do if I were there with her, mentioning that her room has a door that connects to the outside of the house so her parents wouldn't find out. Side note: the phrase "my parents won't find out" is creepy as frak when you've lived away from parents for a while. I keep trying to find reasons to turn her down (she was 16, former student, etc.), but she'd reply with her own internal logic (it's legal here, my uncle got married to someone 15 years younger and they're happy, it's been a long time since school, etc.)

Eventually I just straight-up told her that I'm a hardline Catholic and I only want a Catholic woman, and no premarital sex. She was rebelling against Catholicism because of her father's beliefs and becoming more of what teenagers think a Buddhist is, so that did the trick. I was hoping to make it less abrasive, but she never tried to contact me or hit on me since, so I guess it's a victory. Hopefully she's now dating people her own age. And happy with who she is - she really wasn't at the time. Wish I could have done more to help but that might have been part of what sparked her attraction in the first place. </TEXT>
