	<TEXT> Thanks guys for all your replies, I'm the type of person that isn't bothered at all by spoilers. I know that might sound weird but it doesn't effect my enjoyment at all. I'm very relieved to know that Miller returns in the form of the investigator. I do have one more question, will his departure from the show effect the quality? I guess what I mean is, I love all the characters but Thomas Jane as Miller really was a huge thing for me. I'm assuming other characters will be introduced, does the plot continue to get bigger and bigger? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys, I'm freaking out here, I love Miller, he's my favorite character. I have not read the books. Please tell me he somehow doesn't really die and Julie saves him, or he's coming back as some sort of blue energy Miller, or it at least keeps showing his character with Julie now or SOMETHING!!! I don't want his character to disappear... but hit me with it... I'm prepared for the answer. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> New frame idea, let me know what you guys think </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Ok, First post ever! So I love lycan mythology and werewolf mythology. We have frames based on animals already, so I don't think it would be weird. I would love a frame that is basically based on some form of werewolf, what do you guys think? I think it could be really cool, and my idea for it would be to make him a very mobile, brutal frame that has abilities based around melee, bleed damage and overall damage. 


1. An ability where he could pick up an enemy and throw him violently, into a wall or like into groups of enemies dealing aoe damage and knock down. 


2. An ability similar to rhino's charge, but where he just lunges forward claw slashing enemies in front of him, inflicting bleed proc and damage. 


3. An ability where he can target enemies specifically for a pounce attack, with 2 different mechanics, first mechanic is quick activation of the ability where he quickly launches himself at an enemy and then can be chained to his 1 where he can immediately pick the enemy up and throw them. Second mechanic is I imagine werewolves as being diseased or carrying some form of poison, he charges the ability and you see some green toxin swirl around him, then he launches at an enemy and does an aoe toxin proc with damage.


4. His ultimate could be a full blown werewolf transformation, based on cast time where he takes a few seconds to fully transform, but becomes extremely fast, melee based. Every hit of the melee button (xbox here) he dashes forward with wide claw strikes, bleed procs, can be aimed with the controller, and he regains health with each enemy hit. 


He would have no shield OR armor, Or energy... just tons of health. I will explain no energy. His passive is slow innate health regeneration, and his 4 regains his health, He will have a "rage" or "bloodlust" meter if you will, All of his abilities are based on his rage, where each ability costs a certain amount of his meter, The more rage he has, the faster his passive health regeneration is, and the more damage his bleed procs do and the more damage his abilities do. Every ability cast uses rage, but also generates a smaller amount EXCEPT for his 4, which does not generate any. His normal melee attacks also generate rage. This I believe would allow great synergy for his abilities, chaining his abilities together along with powerful regular melee attacks to gain rage, then unleashing his ultimate, then repeating, or mixing it up at will. 


Last thing, and this will seem strange but bear with me. He won't be able to equip ANY melee weapons, instead his claws will constantly be used. The mechanic would be he could do the quick melee to regenerate smaller amounts of rage, or fully switch to his claws, regenerating more rage per attack. His ability damage and melee damage is based on his rage amount. So I think it could be well balanced by having the player have to balance building rage and unleashing attacks, at higher rage for more damage, and then rebuilding it, etc. Managing and balancing your damage vs rage mechanic, could be an awesome mechanic.  To clarify he could still use primaries and secondaries. 


Anyway I know this isn't even close to perfect design, but just some of my thoughts, would obviously have to be tweaked, but what do you guys think? 

Edit: Format </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uhhh... Yes it would be morally just fucking fine. I'd shoot him in the balls then tie his hands and feet up, watch him bleed to death then go in a sleep like a baby </TEXT>
