	<TEXT> Jesus, yeah that's a much better idea. Wish EA would hurry up and listen to their fan base, I understand Battlefront largely undersold and they've probably lost a lot of motivation...but come on...pay attention to the fans you have

	<TEXT> If it does have to be from an actual poem, Edgar Allan Poe has some interesting poems, here's "Alone"....also, the spelling may seem off, but this is due to the poem being published in 1875

From childhood's hour I have not been

As others were -- I have not seen

As others saw -- I could not bring

My passions from a common spring --

From the same source I have not taken

My sorrow -- I could not awaken

My heart to joy at the same tone --

And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --

Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn

Of a most stormy life -- was drawn

From ev'ry depth of good and ill

The mystery which binds me still --

From the torrent, or the fountain --

From the red cliff of the mountain --

From the sun that 'round me roll'd

In its autumn tint of gold --

From the lightning in the sky

As it pass'd me flying by --

From the thunder, and the storm --

And the cloud that took the form

(When the rest of Heaven was blue)

Of a demon in my view -- </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel as though the new DLC will add new challenges to the game. For example, heating and keeping your roads in good condition. 

It sucks that the weather isn't seasonal though but the maps provided will give players an artistic appeal to their city that the default maps don't really have, and for the price it all seems worth it to me
