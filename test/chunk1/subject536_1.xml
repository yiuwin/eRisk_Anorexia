	<TEXT> don't worry your body is smart. you ate enough to where you probably really shocked your system so I'm sure your body won't like... break down all those calories/absorb all those calories. just drink a lot of water and eat very small portions every three hours of foods high in fiber for the next few days (like fruit or something). if you get like... backed up use laxatives (if you have no access to those candy sweetened with sorbitol and chugging black coffee will work--just don't abuse those items!) I've been there before where I've had some pretty gross binges and I felt like shit but in the long run it didn't cause any long term weight gain. you're good--maybe try restricting less to reduce cravings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> cinnamon, stevia, a tablespoon of peanut butter powder, and salt for oatmeal. sriracha sauce salsa or curry for salad. and sriracha sauce and curry on any cooked foods... oh I also love pepper, chipotle chile pepper, and onion powder sooooo much. I avoid dressing to the death tho. something I really love is plain hummus on my salad. like spinach, black beans, plain hummus, raisins, and sunflower seeds together is SO good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> raw produce can do it! like if you eat raw veggies they can make you bloated(so it's best to eat them cooked). same as sugar free items(ESPECIALLY sugar free gum), lactose, and too much fiber. also food combinations I think can make you bloated? like... if you eat a food that digests slowly then eat a lot of a food that digests quickly it's gonna fuck up your stomach. I have your same problem tho sadly I'm not as tiny; but I'm not sure why it's happening to me. anyway, I hope you like your body soon and that things go well for you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to be dainty and ethereal and eye catching. I want to be beautiful like a doll. so beautiful that people would be drawn to me even if I had a crap personality. I want to be so gorgeous that a boy out there considers me the prettiest girl he knows. I want to be so beautiful that I feel significant and worthwhile. I want to be compared to a bird. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it would be nice if this subreddit  did have something set up where people can make matches for buddies and stuff. I'm in your same boat kind of. I'm 16 and I've struggled with disordered eating for a while. I moved out early and am at a school I adore, but my parents tell me if they think I'm not eating right they'll make me go home immediately so I've started eating more but now that I'm above 110lb I feel disgusted with myself. I really want to get around 100lb but I keep binging and messing things up for myself so I desperately need someone to hold me accountable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay try not to take offense... You could stand to tone up/slim down a bit (you aren't by any means overweight and your body doesn't look bad but you're not slim either); and you may also want to fix your hair. I'm thinking darker hair with more side swept bangs and maybe just a bit longer. You look extremely different and you have very striking/stand outish features but that is not a bad thing. In a way it reminds me of models who just look very alien-esque, unique, and memorable. Kind of like, you're really pretty but in a very unconventional way. Over all I think you have the potential to be really ethereal if you change your hair and go for more bold makeup and a more unconventional style. Have more confidence in your look! I like it! And no, definitely not ugly! </TEXT>
