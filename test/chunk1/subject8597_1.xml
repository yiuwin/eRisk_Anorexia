	<TEXT> Wait... I can transfer save files from one PS3 to another?

I've tried via USB, but the device I moved the file to told me that I was not authorized to use this file on the second ps3. </TEXT>

Im just kinda bored and lonely on my cakeday, and wonder who might feel generous to a fellow hungover from last nights party.

Pie, please! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably not.

Ham sucking, syrup guzzling, Kraft Mac and Cheese obliterating, tapeworm infested Canadians never count. 

Unless you can certifiably prove that you do not suffer any of the above mentioned maladies, I'm afraid I cannot ethically allow you to have this lousy CD.

On the off chance that you can indeed scientifically prove to not be stricken with one of the above listed classic negative Canadian stereotypes, I will gladly have Gladys mail you the disc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes.

Given the style and setting of the game, i cant deny that it was appropriate, but this was not enough to make it palatable to these weary ears.

For perspective: the Snake Eater OST was right up my alley. </TEXT>

Always hated the MGR soundtrack. If something like this were sitting out there as a mod for the PC version, I would be all over it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only reason to hate Snake Eater is because the game is better than the player.

The goddamn thing has style, groundbreaking gameplay, challenge, tons of replayability, and fuck... the feels! 

I loved MGS (deeply), and was all kinds of let down by SOL, to the point that I was sure this series had seen its best day. 
Then someone plopped a copy of Snake Eater in my lap. 

Fuck, fuck, and fuck. The game was everything about MGS that I loved, set in the olive-drab cold war.
 
I went into the game expecting little, if anything and walked out of that thing like Jesus had just tapped me on my impotent shoulder and miraculously dropped my previously mythical balls into existence.

All those haters? 
A bunch of ball-hating trannies. Fuck 'em!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kinda bittersweet.
I promised in another thread that I would blow somewhere between 500 and 800 horses if this game dropped on 03/18. 
The continued wait is going to suck, but man... so relieved that I wont have to suck the better half of a thousand horse dicks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Analog sticks did nothing to improve gameplay on this title (especially when trying to blow up that damned transformer). OP is playing with a keyboard, which the original release had no support for... not that this matter deserves argument, but unless this guy is playing with a playstation controller (or something with a similar setup) he is playing wrong, and his enjoyment will suffer, leading to *pissed offedness*. </TEXT>

I'll blow back.

You are playing on a computer with keyboard, you have no gamepad. It is impossible to play the game as it was intended with this setup.

Rectify this situation. Drop a 20 or two and go buy an old PS1, get a copy of the game as it was intended for release, and treat yourself.

	<TEXT> I once knew a guy who would have filled Burns' shoes pretty damn well. An old boss. I've never used the word to describe a person before, but this guy was a total boob. Always wrong, never sure of himself, somehow the guy got himself a pretty cushy position at a well paying IT firm and wreaked the kind of havoc on interns and consultants that Burns wreaked on his tentmates. The guy was horrifying to anyone new to the company, but anyone with any season knew the guy to be ineffective and mostly harmless (until it came time to code anything...) </TEXT>
