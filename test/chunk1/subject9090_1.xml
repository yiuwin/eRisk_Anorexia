	<TEXT> While I generally like Keanu's movie,I'm quite disappointed in Knock Knock.I couldn't make sense out of the end of this movie,the girls got away unpunished ( and surprisingly they posted their video on facebook where they could be identified by anybody) ,he just half buried in his lawn and he didn't even try to make any contact with his wife through cellphone though he watched the video,what was the sense of that frenzy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are undecided about something or someone ,though you think fast and make quick decisions .You sometime keep things to yourself and rarely express your inner thoughts ,you are a meticulous person in general ,have a sympathetic and friendly nature with a streak of anxiety and right now you are feeling low (that's what I've inferred from your handwriting ) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi
First of all best wishes for your health,you are a very brave person to have survived a stroke at such a young age,was there any history of undue stretching of neck or any exercise of neck muscles that triggered the stroke? </TEXT>
