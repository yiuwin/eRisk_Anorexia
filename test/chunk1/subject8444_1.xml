	<TEXT> So I know that you have to be invited into a fleet, but I was wondering on what types of fleet are out there.

I'm trying to get a feel for what would maximize my experience within the game, and that I would get along with. Apologies if this is a silly question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue that concerns me is that because of the slow turn rate, and the lack of ability to fine tune the power settings, is that one side of the shield takes a crazy beating (usually when an event blows up as I can get away in time) and then it takes a while to recharge. I figure using covariant shield would help due to the large amount of points they offer. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just started playing when it came out for console. I was wondering if anyone had advice and tips on how to best utilize each ship in regards to flying habits. I get the basic of the three types of ships and have read that it is possible to spec any ship to work for any role to an extent.

Was more looking for in game tips on how to fly the ships. I like using cruisers as a tac officer. But due to current gear restrictions the turn rate is almost too much a hindrance. Apologies if this is a silly question. I tried googling this but most threads go into more about how to maximize gear, not so much in game flight strategies. </TEXT>
