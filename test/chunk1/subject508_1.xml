	<TEXT> There are a couple of her improve bits floating around on YouTube, she along with the other performers have alluded to her past with improv comedy at different points. Aisha was quite dead set on wanting to incorporate host games this season, but that sadly didn't come to fruition; not sure if the producers had a reason? I don't know. 

It would be quite nice to see a taping wouldn't it? The tapings usually shoot for 3 to at least 5 hours. Shooting 18-20 games, doing pick ups (Like reshooting the end of the games, other certain points in games, guest star shots; just so editors can make it look less sloppy or make it look much better; had the shot not gone well or if the game needs to be over at a certain time due to time constraints. This is nothing different, It was done in both Drew and Clive's versions) During tapings, you'd see quite a comedic side of her, all the jokes she makes; A lot. So many things that no one would usually see on Television. Aisha's been bringing a bit to the table I'd say, but if the editors could edit in more of her moments, I think she'd win over a lot of peeps.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, you should really do your research. Its not that she cuts the segments short, in fact its not that at all! Its all in the editing, it has to be edited a bit short due to time constraints (Least its better than last year). Pretty Big ego, agree to disagree. She was actually a huge fan of Whose Line herself and she had an incredible knowledge on how the show worked, and has quite a background in stand up comedy and yes, Improv.

As for points, she gives out a lot during the tapings; its just a matter again, of what they edit in! Along with the clever jokes. She doesn't modify audience suggestions a lot. Plus, there was more to sing about with the topic switched to food. If it was stuck at Bacon, it would've just been stuck to that and there would've been fewer clever rhymes and verses to make.
