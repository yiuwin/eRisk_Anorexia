	<TEXT> 10 team standard...

Going back and forth on this one...

I offered to two different people:

Forsett, Joique Bell, Allen Robinson and Charles Johnson

for either:

Eddie Lacy or Jeremy Hill

I need to know which one is the better option, Lacy or Hill?

My starting line-up would then consist of:

Matt Ryan, Jamaal Charles, Eddie Lacy/Jeremy Hill?, Randall Cobb, Julio Jones, Jason Witten, Doug Martin, Panthers D, Matt Bryant </TEXT>

 In addition to coaching at the WWE Performance Center, Amato will also work with WWE Superstars and Divas on the main roster as both a producer and agent.

I've heard she is mostly working with the main roster girls now.

 Sarah Stock has reportedly been confirmed as having signed with WWE as a coach for the WWE Performance Center. Stock is set to become a regular coach there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah someone dropped Odell the week before he made his debut in my league last year and after he played that first game against the Falcons I was like alright I'll pick him up. I had him on my bench till late in the season though cause I had Julio and Jordy and was playing RB flex. Then I switched to Odell, Jordy, Julio. Nice when you get like 70 points weekly off three players. </TEXT>

And it's the whole suspension of disbelief thing, of course he could slam him down if he legit wanted to but that's not what was planned and this was the set finish. When people used to get dragged to the mat for a crippler crossface from Benoit they would immediately reach for the ropes before even getting put down on the mat. </TEXT>

It's been done many times before where people will reach for the ropes before a move is fully locked in. It's ring psychology. Desperation to reach for anything to not get locked into a move. </TEXT>
