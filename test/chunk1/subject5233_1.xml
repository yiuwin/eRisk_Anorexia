	<TEXT> You aren't going to stop career ending injuries to allstar players imo. The enforcers can retaliate for some sort of "justice" but i don't think an enforcer is going to stop the headhunters in their tracks every time. It's a tough role really. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly... this goal shocked me and my friends as we watched it happen. Such a casual moment of "hmm the powerplay isn't looking so great. Stammer shoots this and maybe we get a rebound or kickout for another set up... OMG WTF!"   haha Amazing shot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a neutral fan of this game. I don't think either player should have been called. Zuccs leg also stayed fully extended. Zucc didn't complain about the call. So who's to complain for him? Eyes not hearts boys. Hell of a game though!!

This was a post by a very selfless man who succeeded in contacting Mr. Yzerman for a man dying of cancer. Mr. Yzerman personally made the call to the man and his wife. Touching bit and a class act. Great for the NHL and the world itself! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently it's being rumored all around that epcot will replace most of the ride Maelstrom at the Norway pavilion with the theme from the film Frozen. Frozen being a cute and great film deserves a spot at Disney, but to take away the childhood of so many who love Maelstrom? It seems like a bad move since it's one of the most popular rides at epcot over the past years as is! </TEXT>
