	<TEXT> Im not sure what to tell you, its line shading and eeh linework haha. I dont think my style has a name as I started doing this particular style a few years ago and has just become its own monster. 
But look at Ralph Steadman, I think I am in the same category as him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, But I honestly cant say where my motivation for what I draw comes from. All I do is to sit down and start drawing something and keep drawing until it looks like something Im not ashamed of. 
The trick is just to draw and draw and draw, It does not matter what you draw as long as you draw. If you think to much about it you are just going to get afraid of the paper and walk away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 99% of the time I simply just make the misstakes work. I keep drawing until it looks good. But this and one other drawing I have done I had to retrace as I dont sketch anything out in advance. This one had a baby swan on its back from the beginning and it looked wrong so I had to redraw the whole thing. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope not at all actually, There are 3 artists that I am influenced by and that is: Hokusai, Shohei Otomo and Ralph Steadman. But when I draw something Im not trying to mimic anything, I just sit down with my ballpoint pen and start drawing and whatever comes out comes out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ha! Yes I know that insects got exoskeletons but I just like to morph stuff. :)
-I am working as a tattoo artist but I dont tattoo in the style I draw these illustrations, Or well from time to time people want something in this style but usually its just common subjects. Feel free to have a look at http://www.deadpigeon.se  I try to separate my tattoo style from this personal drawing style as much as possible just to have this as something non work related. Yes the Japanese like my style and find it strange but I have not really tried to show it to the masses at all. Its just my customers that happen to see the framed prints I have on my wall who say that they enjoy it.

Sorry if my English was bad in this reply, Im just of to bed.

Good Night
