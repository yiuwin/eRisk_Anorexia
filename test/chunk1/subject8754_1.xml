	<TEXT> It's not so much the conviction rate. Yes everyone says they are innocent. But it's more or less about money. You have one guy who is in jail for trespassing and is incarcerated for weeks maybe months because he can't afford a free world lawyer. Then you have another guy who is breaking into houses and get bonded out in a day or so gets a good lawyer and probably get probation. Now let's say the guy who is trespassing  broke into a house now. But he has no money. He is most definitely going to prison from 2-10 years. Why? Money. Court appointed "lawyers" don't care. 


Edit: Sorry definitely got off the subject  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been vaping a little over a year now and for whatever reason I still smoke 2 or 3 analogs a day and only at work. I've got good hardware probably to much if you ask me. I've tried higher nic levels but anything that's 12mg or higher burns my throat to bad. I'm getting a little personal here but I'm a recovering addict. I'll have 2 years next month. So I have some understanding of the nicotine addiction aspect of it. If any of y'all have had a similar struggling to mine and overcame it. Let me know what you did to help your situation.  </TEXT>
