	<TEXT> Not baseless when reasarch facts and stats show it has a 50 percent failure rate.

It has not reduced drinkig habits. If you actually read the report that Senate got.

It states that the majoirty  of alcholol related issues got reduced  with community rehabilitation and counselling. Nothing to do with the welfare card.


Your logic is quite possibly some of the most stupid I have ever seen. If it rolls out it won't just be new start getting the card it will be the disabled and they can't just go out and get a job.

 Your logic.. why should your employer pay you in cash he should only give you a gift card to bigw.

	<TEXT> So you are just a troll.

Ceduna has 6 Doctors.
only 1 of them has a HICAP Eftpos terminal that accepts the card.
Yeah good luck getting an appointment if u need to see a specialist.
You first need to see a GP for a referal to a specialist.
The same doctor spoke to the ABC and said a lot of his  and other GP previous clients no longer come into the local clinics due to the lack of payment options.
This is the last thing you want as it just causes health issues down the track 

You are clearly here just to cause  issues,go to bed 

There is a reason the cashless welfare card  failed when it was trialed in the UK. and Denmark.
It just doesn't work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh i hate that.
i used to work for a generation provider 
and the profits they expected where insane

1.50 a day for me at my home 

If we average it down to 1.20  and over 8 million customers  thats like 9.6 million a day.
Fuck off it costs that much to run the network 

when i was at the company the total annual cost to repair line faults excluding natural disasters was about  30 million.

For 2 years from 11-13 it was less than 2 million as almost no issues got reported.

So just wrap ur mind around the amount of money they just had sitting around and you can see where they got off on rolling out extra substations into towns of 2300 ppl lol.
Got to hide that money somewhere 

I was talking about this is another sub before.
After factoring in the costs of generation delivery goods and cost of getting the juice to the consumer.
it was about a 6-7cent KWH cost.
yet you pay 25cents or more utter bullshit </TEXT>

Publicans  be like Oh well how am meant to know  he is an alcoholic Oh fuck off you see the same cunt every day pulling beer after beer. you know he is a drunk.
be far easier to implement a  gaming credit system instead.
You need a card that you place cash onto like a load and go. they check at the counter if your on the list,and or ask to see if you have a pension card.
if you do give em a 50 buck limit till next fortnight.
Cards are numbered and id limited so you can't trade them.

Id much rather piss off some retirees using the pokies than vilify everyone on the welfare system

But the profit margins i saw arefucking insane.
Oh you made 12 percent profit  last FY.
let's make it 15 next,then 20,then 25. 
with wage growth low eventually you will price your own customers out of the market

Cost us  including the overall cost of service delivery to the customer.
about 6.2 to 7 cents per KWH to get juice to your house.

But you get charges 26 or more in most cases.

i think a lot of customer would be happy if we took off the supply charges though as it does not cost us 15 million a day to maintain the network,this is a huge cost for a lot of ppl </TEXT>

One lady had to  sell sexual services  to afford to pay for her specialist bills cause hardly anyone accepts the indue card.
Kmart Ceo GUY RUSSO has said none of his KMART locations would accept the card,as "it is against the morals of KMART,for the govt to dictate how people spend  the money they receive"  so that's one major retailer you won't be able to shop at.

	<TEXT> Why is it always milk.

ARSE LOAD of farmers get fucked over every day,not just milk suppliers.

We know someone who grows  produce and the supplier from the company that on sells to coles told them they won't be paying market price anymore for them  offered them less than 14 cents  a head for lettuce ,and threatend them with legal action if they sold any excess on to anyone they would classify as a competitor  so pretty much anyone..

14 cents for lettuce.
Yet sells them for 4.69 at the shelf?..

Farmers unless they are a massive operation get fucked in this country..

We really need a rethink of the supply economic in this country.

You literally have farmers killing themselves after setting fire to an entire seasons crop as the supplier thinks the oranges look a touch too un round?.

meanwhile coleworth will with great happiness import tins of tomatoes for 55 cents from italy while spc and others go down the drain. 

Or be a total cunt like wollies and say OMG WE ARE FOR FARMERS. gives SPC a contract and then pulls it the second the PR died down

You could get a digital copy of Adobe from a US server for 190 aud. Connect with an Australian ip it was 799 bucks. For a digital product there is no cost for extra distance.

Steam does it to us as well .

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So yes.
i am looking at replacing my 3830k with a ryzen 1700/1700x.
And i have 2x 290x now. YES YES VERY HOT I KNOW.
I have some spare cash from a  scratchie win.
So  
should i get a 1080.
or wait a few weeks to see what amd's Vega is like..


My main reason for upgrading is i have one of the early x79 boards.
only 4 of the sata ports are full speed.

So i could do with  m.2 support so i can whack in a samsung  960  or an intel 600p
Few other extras i want as well...

Thanks guys
