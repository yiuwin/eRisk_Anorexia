	<TEXT> Why no though Tslat? Negatives I could see would be rich people owning and poor people suffering. But since when did gave developers mind about that stuff? NEVER lol

I wouldn't buy all guns, no chance. I'd get the HBRA3 Insanity and the ASM1 Elite. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thoughts on being able to purchase weapons?
I wouldn't mind spending 3 on buying an elite weapon if I had too... Waiting in hope to get the ASM1 Speakeasy will do my nut in, I could potentially be waiting months.

But if there was a way to just buy the weapon, even better? Win/Win for the developers too.. they'll be rolling in cash. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Test out this gun out everyone...
KF5.. its a SMG, perfect for the runners.
Use it until you unlock the Elite version which will have -1 Mobility, +1 Damage, +1 Range. Then add Grip, Laser and Rapid Fire.
Rapid fire is oh so important. If you ever run around a corner and see an enemy, and you both fire at one another, but always die... that'll be a thing of the past. The damage increase due to the Elite version of the weapon,combined with rapid fire means by the time the enemy has fire 2 or 3 bullets at your direction, you've probably done double that to him.
Its so so good.... Not perfect, obviously, but for a fast paced, deadly gun... go for this! </TEXT>

It's a beastly gun.

Close Quarters = KF5 Elite
Medium = BAL
Long Range = IMR (shout out to the snipers too) lol </TEXT>
