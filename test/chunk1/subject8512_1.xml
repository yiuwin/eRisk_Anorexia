This is what i could get after just a short listen, it's probably not fully accurate, but close enough ;)

	<TITLE> Listen to Twentieth Century Harmony by Vincent Persichetti! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I know similar posts have been posted before but anyway.
I love Vincent Persichettis book "Twentieth Century Harmony" even though I haven't read really far in to it yet. I play the piano, and the examples in the book arn't very hard to play, but I want to be able to listen to them without concentrating on playing them as well as hear them without a piano nearby! 
 Do anyone know of anywhere you could get these examples on MIDI or mp3 or something?

When I've finished the book, and if there isn't already recorded versions of the examples in the book, I plan do record them myself with the proper instruments and all, but that's going to take quite a while :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But actually I personally think your classes are better when it comes to describing the characters functions, but they would not probably be as recognised and understood as the classic "Attack, Defence, Tank and Support" classes.
maybe if you changed "DPS" to "Attack" it would be easier for noobs, but idk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, you are right about some characters not fitting in to their class very well, but I don't think it would be simpler for new players to compose a balanced team if you added more classes. Maybe if you ranked the character in each class from left to right where the more left a character is, the more typical to that class it is (so D.va and Symmetra would be at the far right in their classes). or something...
I don't now :(

Lyrics:
Derpulies: I am mighty Derpulies, everybody praise me!
Choir: He is mighty Derpulies, he is bloody crazy!
Derpulies: If anyone disobey me, I'll cut of their winkies
Skobbels: Stop! I'm here to take you down! You must die! Goodbye!
Derpulies: I am dying Skobbels, I love you Skobbels, Why?

We are quite similar, but i'm gonna start ninth grade and have played piano for nine years. You can check out my facebook page here: www.facebook.com/arvidolsonmusic
I work with music every day and have one released single/ep one ready album, and making more every day.
Right now I work a lot with chip tune, but experiment a lot with a mixture of dub step/complextro/glitch. But I'm not sure how we would collaborate, you could give me an example of how you meant, and I would also love to here little of your music!  </TEXT>
