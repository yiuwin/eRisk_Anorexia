But there was no fucking way my parents would let me go a half a mile to the park.  I'm not saying she should be arrested, but a park is a bit much.  If I had a dollar for every person that was abducted or raped in a park near where I live, I'd have about 13 dollars.  

If I have kids, they can ride their bikes around the neighborhood and even go to a store if I tell them it's ok, but no fucking way are they going to a park without me until they are teenagers at least.

	<TEXT> I mentioned it once for refrence:P  I enjoyed shooting pistols while I was in.  You're using your alleged infantry job to be an internet badass/troll.  Also, your dick is getting hard in an internet argument?  I'm going to make a guess and say you came in during 2008 when they severely dropped their requirements and allowed young Marines to become fat disrespectful little shits.  

And yes, the MSG school had a 65% attrition rate.  So I am quite proud of it.  This does not make me a badass at all.  In fact I was huge nerd while I was in and still am.  

However, you are shouting "boot" and "pog" like it means something.  I'm willing to assume you speak with a drill instructor voice on occasion too.

Fth 20

I'm using a +10 raw heide sword, +5 dragonrider bow, +5 raw drangelic greatsword.  My armor is syan helm, vengarl body, drangelic hand, vengarl boots and drangelic shield.  This puts me right under 70%

This is my first build and I know I made it poorly, and I feel extremely weak on bosses.  I like my bow the way it is mostly and would like hit much harder as melee.  I'm not oppposed to miracles and sorcery but it's not currently my priority.

Any advice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lead a relatively relaxed raid group on a small server.   We've had pretty much the same people since the game launched but recently some players have been harder to get a hold of.  Basically we need a decent whm who can be in Mon and Thurs 7 pm till 1030 pm est.  And it would be nice if they were on for non raid content periodically through the week.

We used to raid every night but we all have jobs and significant others so it's basically limited to night time play and anyone joining us expected to be relaxed and mature.   Everyone in the group gets a say, I am leader in title only.   

There are many reasons to not come to this server.   There are very few skilled players on the server and the ones who are are the stereotypical nerd rage types who need to validate their existence because their own life sucks. 

That being said, I can promise if you are the right person, you will have a drama free experience with guys who have at least the bare basics in social abilities and people who genuinely enjoy the game as a hobby and are all relatively highly skilled when it comes to raiding.   If you are interested let me know and we'll talk on vent about what we can work out.   I know the post sounds dreary but I want to be clear this server is no rose garden,  but it will be just fine for the right person. .... Yeah that's about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This subreddit is mildly troubling to me.   

Avoid trouble.   Be polite to people and avoid obvious troubling situations.   Do not take any advice from people on the internet on how to fight or use intermediate weapons.   Do not put yourself in a position where you need to attack or defend from attack.   

But most importantly again, do not take fighting or self defense advice from someone in the internet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Call it a pity party or what have you.  I want to buy you/your significant other/your kid/your relative/whatever a gift.  I'll just pick one person at random.  Or if no one responds, I'll by myself a large amount of peeps and recreate the boulder scene from Indiana Jones.

Don't be shy.  Just take it.  I don't even care if you are a scammer, scammers need love too.  Just know you have to live with your lies.  Merry fucking Christmas. 



Edit- I'll go through these after work.  Thank you for the suggestions of local charities.  However, I want to give it on reddit because I use and enjoy reddit.  I would like my contribution to be to just reddit.  Thanks for understanding.  

Edit- I'm in the SE Georgia area in case that is easier than shipping.

*Purchases Edit*

So this has been horrifingly difficult to choose one person.  I seriously couldn't, I'm not sure anyone could.  I decided to break it up into a bunch of small purchases.  Thanks if you made it easy with an amazon list.  I randomly spun my mouse and just clicked on whatever post it landed on.  Seriously I think I feel worse after reading half of these.  I may do some more later.

The choosing was completely impartial and whether it was cheap or slightly more expensive was completely at random.  If I asked for more info please just shoot it to me whenever:)

Are there any groups that would mind taking on another person that takes instruction well and doesn't cause any drama? :P  Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I uninstalled.  It feels great.  The game is so god damned addicting I didn't think I'd be able to.  This game is not fun it just tricks you into thinking it's fun by giving you a potentially unlimited amount of power.  BUT WHO CARES.  Nothing about any of the fights are entertaining or memorable.  This whole thing is just a test of patience or the hope that somehow the next piece of gear will make your character feel more complete...which it never will.  The story is virtually non existent or I'm guessing geared more towards early junior high.  This is the first time I would say that the twilight series was better than something.

You got my 60 dollars blizzard.  I am ok with that.  But I will not subject myself to your facebook style game or your awful fan base any longer (diablo forums, not reddit)  I just wanted to briefly share my elation with the masses and hopefully inspire.  Or not, who cares.  The only way to win this is to not play and I just won.  

Good night, and good luck.  (I hope you will one day make games I enjoy throughly the way I enjoyed the second warcraft and the first diablo...I think that may not be possible though)

	<TEXT> I noticed the driving force of /r/gaming is mostly skyrim, but I see diehard pokemon fans daily.  I found a really decent pokemon clone on facebook called Mystic Guardians.  

http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=187008424703218

It is by no means a ground breaking, but if you like these kinda games I'd recommend checking it out.  Current level cap on guardians is 20 but I've played this company's other games and they are usually good at frequent updates.  

I know facebook games are evil money making machines, but I have yet to run into a situation where I'd bother with the premium currency.  

Either way, try or don't.  Just figured I'd share. </TEXT>
