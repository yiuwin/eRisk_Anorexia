	<TEXT> "Why are you still hanging out with us?"  Said to me in 7th grade by a girl in a group of people I considered friends.  I think they decided I was a tagalong, and they nominated her to kick me out.  It was a wake-up call that I needed to find real friends, which did eventually happen in high school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Learn Piano or Guitar. A cheap electric piano or acoustic guitar can be found on CL for $100 or even $50, and they can last for a very long time. Learn on YouTube for free. It takes a while to "outgrow" an instrument, at which point hopefully you have more $$ to get something nice.  If it flops, re-sell the thing on CL for the same amount you bought it for.
Source: I learned both as a kid, the skills have brought me a lifetime of music playing I would not have otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For great tone, stick with tube.  The biggest mistake I made in regard my understanding of amps is that more watts = better amp.  My first "real" amp was a Marshall 100w tube half stack (4 x 12 cab), and it truly sounded amazing, but only at ear-splitting volumes.  Later, I used to lug around this terrible-sounding heavy 30w tube vintage Crate amp thinking 30 was a minimum of sorts.  These days I use a 5w tube Blackstar (HT-5R) and it sounds SO much better, weighs 25 pounds, and gets great tone even at low volumes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Helping a friend move, he gave me a $200 glider (chair). If that wasn't enough, when we were done, some rich kid moving out took an EPSON projector and placed it in the dumpster. I dumpster-dove that mutha and it works perfectly! My wife and I turned it into a 12-foot screen for our bedroom, and kept it out of a landfill. I've even used it to sell some of my photography, I guess it's the gift that keeps on giving. </TEXT>
