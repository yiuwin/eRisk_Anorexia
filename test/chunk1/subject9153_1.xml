Apparently, packs that you earn on the Prize Wheel after a ladder victory were tradeable. That Wheel used to give better prizes instead of the "win 1 or 2 tokens" that we have right now, getting those packs was easier.

And not only did they make it harder, they just trade-locked them some days ago. Devs want to mess with us </TEXT>

I do have 4 Sycamore but it's usually a dead draw because I only have 1 of each strong mon (I guess I'll have to use Sacred Ash to get them back)

I guess I'll go for Yveltal-EX, didn't see this on time and got a Darkrai-EX breakpoint. Then I'll go for Malamar-EX and probably discard the Hydreigon line.

	<TEXT> I didn't really find much about the actual metagame, I just got a Dark Hammer deck and started to win duels to buy packs and climb ladder, I started 3 days ago. 

I don't know if I should focus on building an ultimate deck or if I need some variety, so I'll list my current deck and some good cards I've got.

My current deck, "Dark Souls":

Pokemon x13:  

Darkrai-EX x2 / Deino  / Zweilous / Hydreigon / Yveltal breakthrough / Zorua x2 / Zoroark Mind jack / 
Zoroark BREAK / Togekiss-EX / Larvesta / Volcarona

Trainer 32:  Escape Rope / Evosoda / Level ball / Max Elixir / Max Potion / Bursting Balloon / Max Revive / Trainer's Mail x2  / Ultraball x4 / Vs Seeker x3 / Sycamore x2 / Cilan x2 / Fisherman / Judge / Lyssandre x2 / Pokemon Center Lady x3 / Prof. Birch Research x2 /
Skyla /  Team Flare Grunts / Teammates / Fighting Fury Belt / Muscle Band

Energy 13:   Double Colorless Energy x3 / Rainbow Energy / Fairy Energy / Dark Energy x8

Togekiss-EX and Volcarona seem like outliers but they do a good job, they help to set up energy since my pkmn need a lot. Zoroark BREAK is usually a win condition. I don't really know how to update that deck.


I also have some Fighting core since I bought Dark Hammer, 2 Machamp-EX, and M-Lucario EX (but no base Lucario-EX) Would it be better to go down that route? 

Thanks in advance, I really don't wanna miss good offers now that I can win tourneys to get packs, I see a lot of EXes and I don't know if I need them

	<TEXT> Well yeah, maybe I spoke too much of my specific situation.

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter if his NP gain is bad, it is still really easy to  charge his NP because of Arts chains (he's got 2 blue cards so those happen often), and most importantly, because he almost always crit (cuz he made a ton of stars before)

I mean, I have proof. http://imgur.com/mBBOUNI Look at it. That's after his NP-brave chain, I'm not sure, but it probably was an NP-AA chain and he critted. He was back at 71%. That's quite a LOT

Then, look again, I used taunt on Kerry himself, so the enemies will hit him, paired with another Arts crit it means... exactly. I managed to instantly recharge his NP on one turn.


Even if it seems gimmicky, the fact that with some lucky crits it's possible to recharge him that quickly, totally dismisses his bad NP gain.

That shouldn't be a factor to dismiss HIM, also that debuff on his second skill isn't usually relevant. 

In any case, I'd say that the main thing Shiki has over him is simply her HIGH instakill rate. If you believe yourself lucky you can just bring her instead of him and instakill that monster, but Kiritsugu would be a better, more consistent choice against servants since you don't instakill them that often (and he would make stars for your berserkers or whatever, he's only below Jack and Okita I believe) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That maturity isn't automatically acquired with age, and it may never come.

Speaking about me. I don't really see myself as an adult, in contrast with those kids who were too mature for their age. Apparently, it comes from experiences, and if you lack those, you can stay mentally young forever.

I'm a loner and my parents pay everything so I haven't deal with betrayal, bad friendships, exgirlfriends, losing jobs, losing people close to me. That kind of stuff. I don't know why the hell would someone want to be independant. I've seen classmates talking about going to work, wanting to buy a car or taking this girl to an apartment and it's so alien to me.

And things may never change, It's a good and bad thing depending on the person I guess. For me it's good but I'm sure it can bother someone else.  To never be able to feel adulthood

Also, college sucks and middle/high school was better. College only works for people who already wanted to be independant and free and yabba dabba, but everyone just does whatever they want, and go to parties and drink alcohol... not my thing. I liked it better when we were like 50 kids on the same class and we were always together for hours. That way I had friends. They didn't have a choice. And I could do my best impression of a savage monkey without people looking at me weird </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They already got rights for women and gay ppl and that's fine, just stop it there. 

Each time I read about social justice warriors or whatever they are called, they're doing even more trivial stuff and they are obnoxious.

I thought it wasn't an issue but a friend just became your stereotypical tumblr sjw vegan feminist with equally obnoxious friends, dying their hair and talking about stuff no one really cares about.

But slowly and surely, their numbers increase. We should be like 1950's society, just with added rights to gay and women and black people. Happy families here and there, hard-working people, no one getting upset about people using physical violence and insulting. Nowadays some even call for "trigger warnings" for god's sake.

Probably the f-g-ot word is banned here, or p-ssy, but that's how I see society nowadays, they are just so damn sensible it's not even funny. I couldn't add "special snowflake" somewhere in my rant so I'll just leave the words there.

	<TEXT> For each fighter like you, we get 10 feminists jumping at our throats claiming that there's nothing wrong with it and 10 men supporting them just trying to get laid.

But it isn't as unpopular as you think, more like, a lot of people think it (almost all of the rejected guys think this) but if someone complains they get quickly shot down as whiny.

That shit women pull of "dating up" and not wanting to settle down with someone average... I see it everyday and it always makes me bitter. 

You don't see normal guys trying to get Emma Watson or the hot cheerleaders, we have fairly low standards (just don't be painful to look at) but they don't. And they get encouraged to get the best they can get. Every post about asking women to lower their standards ends in a sandstorm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I play Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle on japan and it has a lot of SSR, and with that comes better rates.

Since the SSR pool is so big, you won't be getting the ones you want, so there are people who will spend many moneyz, but as F2P you will be happy getting good cards on almost every multi roll 

And it has like 6 limited cards but some of them randomly come monthly


At first I wanted to believe that, once the SSR pool on Fate was big enough, they would upgrade the rates (at least times 4) but they are TOTALLY SCREWING this chance by making so many limited servants. Actually I should make a post about it. By keeping few goldies on the gacha, they don't feel like giving us better rates.  </TEXT>

but with DW lately releasing so powerful servants (and him being limited) I expected him to have some WTF power.

Maybe interlewd doubles his NP damage. 

Still maxing his stats tho, it's like a safe Berserker. You get to hit slightly higher against everyone and take half damage. On hard content he'd be the best replacement for a basaka

Also maxing Ko Gil, he is so well rounded. You can't go wrong using him </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is this downvoted, it's legit one of the best questions. I always wonder the same but everyone just talks about feeding the waifu.

Cu is the best hands down, with fou he gets 4* stats.

After that, I'd say Lu Bu. Equip him with a high atk CE and you can have a 3* basaka with 10k atk.

Chevalier D'eon because he is all about getting hit, more HP helps him and you can make him do some decent damage.

Andersen and Hans are good choices. They still have plenty of use, sometimes you even use them over gold servants of the same class.

And Jekyll would really become a monster with max stats </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have the same question, respond pls.

I did some research and found that he was top tier like 5 months ago, and his Special Attack does supreme damage (above extreme) so he seems good.

Links with INT Cooler and Frieza (+2 Ki)

But I haven't found any special comments about him. He's good on paper but doesn't seem to be relevant, no one talks about him. I think he has really good stats but doesn't link with popular units (saiyans and gods)

Still worth it using him without links if you have TEQ support.

And he obviously has to be extremely durable. So, how would that have gone? Maybe Tatsumaki wouldn't be able to get a cheap kill just twisting his head (but considering anime feats... she can even pull a meteor in a second)
