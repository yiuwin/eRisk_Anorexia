	<TITLE> Did a Chuck Norris movie song rip off Neil? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-17 20:21:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was watching an older movie with Chuck Norris last night called Braddock: Missing in Action III (the why i was watching isn't important). There's a song that plays throughout the entire movie that sounds eerily similar to [Neil's Depression Blues.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3jWSEBgYgA)  
    
Here's the song from the movie, [Ron Bloom - Freedom Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xev6tAxc7w)  

At first I was worried it was the other way around as Lucky Thirteen was released in 1993 but this song is an unreleased track from Old Ways in 1983. The movie came out in 1988.

edit: The movie came out in 1988 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just moved into a new house (renting) and called to have the gas turned on. I opened up the oven and saw a metal bar hanging from the top of the inside of the oven. It has 2 small clips on it that make me think it was attached to the top of the oven at some time. [Here is a picture] (http://i.imgur.com/17cVFH1.jpg). 

I'm clueless when it comes to gas stoves so I apologize if this is a stupid question.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Army Helicopters over N. Dallas Thursday evening... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-09 16:20:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I live in N. Dallas and on Thursday evening around 7pm while sitting on my deck, 2 Army Chinook helicopters flew VERY low over my apartment complex traveling NW. I've been living here for a year now and although I do get civilian helicopters flying that same route overhead, I've never once seen a military helicopter on that route. What really struck was how low they were flying and close in formation. I was having a discussion with my wife at the time about the recent police shootings and was right in the middle of saying we're going to see a lot of backlash. Woke up the next morning to the news in Dallas.   

 
Anybody else live in the North Dallas area and see these? Do you see them on a regular basis or was this a once off sighting?   
I was just thinking about it over the last 2 days and it seemed oddly timed given the events of that evening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently moved away from Albany and somebody at my work recently asked me about a place called Dr. Bungholes Late Night Lounge....  
  
I thought he was kidding but there are a few hits on google for a place with this name although a few diffferent options pop up for an exact location. I'm seeing it either on the corner of Henry Johnson and Livingston area or on Washington behind where Waterworks is. ..  

Anybody familiar with this? I thought the name was hilarious. Maybe Waterworks changed their name? Any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Did I rewire my Dryer correctly? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-13 16:08:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hoping somebody can shed some light on a little project I undertook over the weekend. Bought a used dryer from a neighbor. Went to plug it in and realized that it was 3 prong plug and the socket was 4 prong. Went to Lowes and bought the 4 prong replacement. 

  
So this is where the confusion begins. After reading a bunch of different websites, youtube videos of electricians doing this exact thing and asking people with more knowledge than me I ran into a conflict of thought.   

Option 1 was to use the new ground wire from new 4 pronged outlet and connect to the ground on back of dryer putting it OVER the already installed ground wire  
Option 2 was to put the new ground wire on spot where old ground was and take old ground wire and put it under the neutral wire.   
  
There was a lot of back and forth on the internet about what was the correct way to install this. I hooked it up with Option 2 and it works fine (I believe it would've worked fine both ways but there is a correct way to do it).  
  
So did I do this right? Should I go back and put the original ground wire under the new ground wire or leave the original ground wire on the neutral??  
Sorry for any confusion with terminology, i'm not good with this sort of thing.   
Everything is working fine and I wasn't electrocuted but just looking to put my mind at ease </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently switched my wife's phone from Boost Mobile to Metro PCS. She is on the exact same plan with same allocated data a month but she claims now that watching 2 videos basically eats up all her data whereas she used to be able to watch  Youtube frequently while using her Boost account and never ran out of data.   
Is there a setting on Metro PCS phone somewhere that I can change. I read a little about the Data Maximizer..could this be the problem? Any thoughts or feedback would be much appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been using HR Block for years to file my taxes (NY state and Federal). I recently moved from NY to TX and went to do taxes. 
  
1st Trip I was told there was an error on w2 and to get it fixed.  

2nd Trip I was told by a different lady that the other guy was only one autorized to do NY returns.  

3rd Trip Cancelled by them and I've been told that they are refusing to do NY tax returns?  

I understand that filing NY returns is a little more complicated and requires some extra work but for a place that markets itself as "tax professionals" I am flabbergasted at this. Also I asked the guy who originally was going to file our return where he would suggest I go and he had no answer...I'm at a loss here

I've seen this movie a ton of times and I thought it was pretty obvious that he is NOT the last Samurai but rather Katsumoto's character. To me Cruise's character was the narrator of the story about Katsumoto. I looked around and saw a lot of articles saying how stupid it was that Tom Cruise is the Last Samurai. ..Am I interpreting this movie wrong?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Albany is constantly being referred to in TV shows/Movies/Games and I'm curious if anybody knows why or can think of a good reason. It's not like SUNY or Siena are known for their creative writing programs to the point that they're churning out Hollywood writers, but Albany consistently gets mentioned.   

Examples: Simpsons, Arrested Development, Gamer, 2 commercials I've seen over the holidays 
There are so many and I'm blanking right now but anybody have any guesses as to why they feature so predominantly  </TEXT>

edit: Wow you guys don't miss a thing! I wasn't looking out for it while watching the movie, I just saw that this morning and couldn't figure out where they squeezed it in or if they had purposfully leaked that pic to mess with people's expectations. Thanks for the replies! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently re-watched John Carter...you know what? It's not that bad, it's actually pretty good.  
I thought Avatar was a huge let down and didn't live up to the hype. ..and there was plenty of hype.

 TBH I hated Avatar, it ranks as one of the biggest flops I've ever been excited to see. But John Carter, a movie that really flew under the radar is exactly what Avatar should've been.  
 Im preparing for an onslaught of people who loved Avatar to come crashing down on me, but is there anybody else out there who thinks that John Carter was a pretty decent movie? On par with Avatar? Better/Worse? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was listening to some PE last night and heard this line  
*"If man is the father then the son  
Is the center of the earth  
In the middle of the universe  
Then why is this verse coming  
Six times rehearsed  
Don't freestyle much so  
I write 'em like such  
Amongst the fiends  
Controlled by the screens  
What does it all mean  
All this shit I'm seein  
Human beings scream vocal javelins  
Signs of a local nigga unravelin'  
My wandering  
Got my ass wondering  
Where Christ is  
In all this crisis  
Hatin' Satan  
Never knew what nice is  
Check the papers*  
**While I bet on Isis**  
*More than your eyes can see  
And ears can hear  
Year by year  
All the sense disappears  
Nonsense perseveres  
Prayers laced wit fear  
Beware  
2 triple 0 is near"*  

  
Obviously not a direct reference to ISIS as it was long before they were around but given the context within the song it definitely makes sense today.

Anybody have any ideas on what exactly he meant? Probably a reference to the Egyptian Goddess but even so it is a little criptic </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They started out with an awesome early 90's playlist with tons of old school rap/hip hop and dance tunes from that era. They then graduated to Mid-late 90's pop/rock. Eventually they caved and started playing modern pop music. Now its March and they are playing Christmas music. Is the DJ dead behind the mic? Should someone check on him? Does anybody want to listen to Christmas music in March? I don't even like 98.3 starting their Christmas playlists in November but 105.7 are really just being ridiculous.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A friend gave me a bootlegged CD years ago and it had a live Martin Sexton concert. It was an amazing CD which i lost track of. On it, Martin does a version on Glory Bound that is out of this world. After the Verses and Choruses he launches into a dueling solo between his guitar and his vocals in which he matches what he does with his guitar with some high pitched vocals. The CD was given to me circa 2001/2002. I've listened to every live version of Glory Bound i can find and havent been able to find this version. Any help would be much appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When my dog (10year old Yellow Lab named "Shake") disappeared over the side of the cliff I had a sinking feeling he'd do something stupid. Imagine my surprise when I looked over the steep drop off to see him 30 feet below in the water.  So to the kind kayaker who paddled over to help get him out of the water I wanted to say THANK YOU!  You sir are owed a beer. You came right over when you saw him fall/jump? in and you got right out of your kayak to help me get him back up over the ledge.  Thank you so much for your help, he's 10years old I try not to give him the opportunity to perform such ridiculous feats of stupidity but he still manages to surprise me everyday.   I'm more than happy to buy you that beer. Its a longshot that you will see this but I thought this would be a better place to post than Craigslist's "Missed Connections" or the Metroland's classy "I SAW U".  Thanks again! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was wondering does anybody know how to write a formula for what I need.  Basically I have a list of names going down the column (A) and then a column for Monday-Friday(B-F). There is another column (G) that I would like to have copy names from Column A if they meet the criteria.  I want it so if i type is (eg. "sus") in any of B-F column on that name's Row, that the name from Column A will appear in Column G. I dont want it to be moved per se but start of a running tally of the names if the "sus" appears in anyone of their B-F columns.  I've been playing around with it and I think i could do it if it were just numbers I was dealing with but with the text involved I think i need to approach it differently.   My programming knowledge is very outtdated and under used. I thought it would look something like   =if(B1:F1 "sus") G1=A1    This is most likely a horrible representation of what I need but any help on the matter would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A guy gets sent to prison. His first day in the yard they are told to walk in a circle, no talking allowed between the prisoners. After a few minutes somebody yells "16" and the whole yard errupts with laughter. They continue walking in circles when someone else shouts out "54" and again everybody starts dying laughing. 
The new guy, being confused, whispers to the guy in front, "Hey whats with the numbers?"
The other prisoner tells him , "well since we arent allowed to speak to one another we've memorized jokes and assigned numbers to them all. When somebody shouts out a number, we think of the joke and then laugh".

Wanting to make a good impression on his first day, the new guy waits his turn. More numbers are called and everyone is laughing as they walk. Finally the new guy decides to make his mark, "18" he yells....but nobody laughs.

After a few minutes he whispers to the guy in front again, "Hey what the hell man?"
The guy turns to him and says, "ahh well its all in the way you tell it".
