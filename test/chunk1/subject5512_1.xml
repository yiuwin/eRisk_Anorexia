	<TEXT> Okay, so I'm setting my sights on this series... And I'm so confused.


Is Fate 06, then Zero, then UBW a good order?

People say 06 should be skipped, but I'm afraid I'll completely miss out on a big part of the story of the show.

Does one have to put in SO MUCH to repeatedly play the novels and get the best understanding of the world?


Please help a newbie out - this series looks AMAZING but there's obstacles abound. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ratings are lower, the show is treated like garbage, and we haven't even gotten proper stretches of new episodes. Does this mean our show is going to die a painful death? Is it already dead? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty concerned about our show's future - ratings keep dropping and everybody thinks the story is getting worse... Does this mean HTGAWM will die a quick, cruel death to TV since not much seems to be going its way? </TEXT>
