	<TEXT> i've played the first 3 levels so far - have yet to see the movie.  The cut scenes i think are strait out of the movie, and the voice acting in game is the same big stars from the movie.  not quite as good as lego marvel (which i think is the best lego to date) but still solid.  If you've gotten other lego games and enjoyed them, you wont be sorry to get this one either.  the amount of collectables (number wise) is a little more than half of what lego marvel has, i believe. </TEXT>
