	<TEXT> I only have my first year grades. The grades from year 1 matter only when you're applying because they show up in the transcript. For most universities, once they've accepted you and given you an offer (which is most likely conditional), the second year grades( i.e official results) are just meant for the student to fill the conditions set by the university and confirm that if the student has filled them, then they're attending uni. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not something impossible to come back from; It could always be worse but if you've let yourself down then it's definitely a bad grade. You still have the second year (like me) and you can work on your IA's and Written Tasks (like I'm trying to do) over the holidays because they make a significant impact on your year 2 grade. </TEXT>
