	<TEXT> Funny i was going to ask the Nation what podcast were best to listen to. I used to listen to Just Blog Baby podcast but that went a stray a while back. What other podcast are out there besides the bricks?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Compared to last year this schedule is much more favorable. My first instincts are 9-6 going into KC last game of the season with playoff implications. The Nation will Rise Again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> to share a kinda similar story....I'm originally from Colorado, dockery country,  and I've never been to California but I've been a lifelong fan of The Nation. I've gotten so much shit from Bronco over the years its ridiculous. But i keep coming back because there nothing better in sports when the Raiders are good.  A modern day fan should start with watching 1998. Jon Gurden transformed the franchise like Scott Synder and Batman, with stand through the tuck rule, and a heart wrenching super bowl. Go  through the last decade of mediocrity at best and be jazzed up about the future. Why? Because we love the fucking Raiders! If you join this team be ready. It's not for the light hearted. Happy to have you if you are in.  </TEXT>
