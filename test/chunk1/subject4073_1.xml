	<TEXT> It's been a while since I've watched Borneo, but I remember them being so close and then a tiny thing happening and Sue suddenly hating Kelly and not wanting to be associated with her. And then obviously there was the snakes and rats speech. I just felt like there has to be more to the story that we didn't see, has anyone ever come out and commented on this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll keep the details short because I don't want to come off as braggy, but I had a great weekend this weekend, and actually wasn't miserable for like the first time in a long time on the fourth of july. I had a ton of fun.

So why do I still feel like crying my eyes out? How are things ever going to get better if, even when they're at their best, I still feel empty and hopeless inside? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need help resisting lust </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-29 13:11:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I feel like my life has become overrun by lust. It seems like 90% of the things that I do are lust-driven and I can feel it driving a wedge in my relationship with God. I pray about it often but I have to make the appropriate lifestyle changes and it seems like I just can't do it. I just don't know how to control myself. It's either don't give in to my lust and my desires, but continue to be blinded by them and let them control my life, or act on the lust, and sin, in order to temporarily escape. But I know neither of those are the right option, I know I have to learn how to not feel the lust in the first place. I need to learn how to overcome the lust, take back control of my life, and strengthen my relationship with God.

Sorry if this is coming off as ranty. I'm posting this looking for words of encouragement, or advice, or tough love, I don't know. I didn't want to make it a prayer request because there are people with a lot bigger issues and I feel like that would be rude of me to ask for people to pray for me...but I need help. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Something I've noticed about relapsing </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-13 13:16:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Every time I've relapsed, the first time I jack off feels great. Afterwards I don't feel guilty or shitty at all, and I wonder why it is I've been restraining from doing this for so long. Then I get horny again very quickly and it's like I never jacked off at all. So the second time I jack off, whether it's the next hour, day, or a couple of days later, it feels even better, but then afterwards, I feel completely shitty and wish I hadn't relapsed.

I think that's what is so hard about this. It's hard to see the benefits not fapping can bring because there's never any quick transition between the feeling of not fapping and the feeling of fapping. It's like a drug: the first time you use it, it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, so you get to using it again, but it's only once you're hooked again that you realize you don't want to be using it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand that they brought some interesting drama and were somewhat compelling villains in Kaoh Rong, but they just added so much unnecessary negativity and really fucked up the ending of the season imo. Michele completely deserved to win for playing up to their egos but having a choice between having two bitter, immature egomaniacs on the show who will potentially make it far and impact how the season plays out in a major way, and not having that, I'd definitely choose the latter. I just don't get why so many people here have such a huge hard on for them. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Season after season, Survivor has seen conniving villains, shocking blindsides, and bold strategy. Many players have shined as the masterminds behind this chaos, but there are two sides to every coin, and for every betrayal, there is a victim. Now, 15 of these cheated castaways are coming back to seek revenge. What they don't know is that they will be playing with the three people who robbed them at their shot of the million dollars:

Abi-Maria Gomes is notorious for making more enemies than friends, living by the motto, "if you fuck with me, you're dead." She will return alongside five people whose deaths were her responsibility: RC Saint-Amour, Woo Hwang, PG Law, Jeff Varner, and Andrew Savage.

Cirie Fields is a beloved player, but she is no stranger to the art of the blindside. In her three Survivor seasons, she planned and executed numerous eliminations. Five of these players will return with her in order to expose her for the villain she is: Shane Powers, "Timber" Tina Scheer, Yau-man Chan, Stephenie Lagrossa, and Erik Reichenbach.

Candice Cody first rose to fame when she chose to mutiny her tribe. This move set the tone for the rest of Candice's first season as well as her two times returning to Survivor. Her past is back to haunt her as five of her victims return with her to seek their revenge: Jessica "Flicka" Smith, Jonathan Penner, Brad Culpepper, Amanda Kimmel, and Tom Westman.

The twist? These 3 players will not be on a tribe with the people they betrayed, but will rather be competing against them. Will one of these 15 players be able to seek their revenge, or will one of the 3 once again come on top? Find out in Survivor: Out-Abied vs. Out-Ciried vs. Out-Candiced.


EDIT: Through running this season in my head, I have determined that the winner would be Amanda with runner up Stephenie and second runner up Flicka. I am okay with this result. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's bad enough that there is such a vehement attitude towards Christianity and religion at large in today's world, but I feel like increasingly there are so many Christians who twist the scripture to fit their own desires, goals, and beliefs. I make no claim to be a perfect Christian, but I'm talking about people who directly contradict or ignore the Bible and claim it is truly Christianity. I don't know, it just frustrates me to see people professing lies as Truth and I know it is our duties as Christians to change this and to preach Truth to everyone, but it seems like no one cares to hear any viewpoint but their own anymore. </TEXT>

Every prize won is given to the castaways on the island.

	<TITLE> After having time to reflect, this is my thought on who the best player of Kaoh Rong was. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-21 09:21:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think that on paper, Aubry is a great player. Overall, she is physically, strategically, and socially savvy, and she played a fantastic game of survivor.

That being said, I think that Michele played a fantastic game of survivor: kaoh rong. Aubry may be a great survivor player in general, but Michele played a better game specific to the conditions and people of this specific season, and because of that, she won it. Aubry's game is great if you isolate it, but subjectively, in the context of this season, Michele played the better game.

I see everyone who thinks Aubry should have won bashing Michele, and everyone who thinks that Michele deserved her win trying to discredit Aubry. This is so stupid though because they're both fantastic survivor players, just in different environments. Aubry may be great in 9/10 different seasons, but in this one she failed to adjust to the people around her. Michele may have not played a classically great game, but she was able to fit her gameplay to the season she was playing in and deserves her win because of it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You have Russell/Tai, who made a lot of crazy moves, but alienated everyone in the process, Parvati/Aubry, who was the dominant force behind the majority of the game, but lost to Sandra/Michele, who was simply better friends with most of the jury. You even have Parvati/Aubry identifying Sandra/Michele as a threat to go to the end with when no one really believed it.

I think the difference is that for whatever reason this season was edited so that it seemed like there was no way Michele could possibly beat Aubry, whereas Parvati didn't get nearly as strong of an edit in HvV. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We all knew this season was going to be a clusterfuck, but I think most of us still approached it with rational minds and like we would an average survivor season. We didn't think anything would Kaoh Rong.

Everything Kaoh'd Rong. Three people were medivaced, an incredibly powerful super idol ended up never being used, the clear  pick to win somehow bewilderingly lost in FTC despite never being shown in a negative light, the reunion show was a bizarre fever dream, Liz the robot and #1 winner's pick was the third boot because she was blindsided by the crazy-felon-red-lobster-waitress, a significant amount of the focus went to a chicken, there were 5,000 different twists and advantages, the big brother homophobe was one of the most likable guys ever, Brawn went on a streak of losing the premerge challenges, and the next season is called Millenials vs. Gen X. 

I'm still coping with Aubry's loss, but I think if you view this season as an absurdist nightmare where everything Kaohs Rong, it's a lot easier to digest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is probably a controversial opinion but I think our society is gravely mistaken in that we equate pmo to things like hunger or being tired, or something that is a basic physiological need that we need to fulfill.

And after everything else he asked me "Do you honestly think you're the only person I've fucked this week?"

The rational side of my mind is telling me that this was just an awful experience, but gay bros, please, please tell me this isn't common behavior in the gay community. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just finished watching Nicaragua...and everyone considers this season one of the biggest trainwrecks of the show's history...but damn I didn't expect the reunion to be just as much of a trainwreck. I mean we've got moments like:

-Fabio mumbling something for a minute about art and creating his own company and more about creating art, then literally not talking for the rest of the reunion.

-Chase being asked to sing one of his songs and then awkwardly being talked over by Jeff after fifteen seconds followed by the band joining in and Fabio exclaiming "Are they playing your song?!"

-Two random cuts to Coach's face throughout the reunion.

-Shannon explaining that he was just "calling a duck a duck".

-NaOnka's mom not being sure whether to sit down while Jeff takes it to commercial.

-Purple Kelly being as purple as ever.

-Jeff asking both Dan and Jane how much money they make on national television, and Dan completely ignoring him and talking about his sons.

-The introduction to the god-forsaken redemption island.

-Spending time updating everyone on the family history of Boston Rob instead of talking to one of the 5 ignored castaways, then having him take it to commercial.

-Jeff not understanding a word Wendy Jo said.

I think this reunion show is what kicked off the dark ages of survivor, not redemption island. What a shit show, in the best possible sense of the word. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> When did media (Movies and TV shows in particular) become so profane? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-18 06:54:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I mean, in the fifties, a couple couldn't even be shown sleeping in the same bed. Humor in movies back then used to be a lot more witty and subtle. Now, our media contains graphic violence and sex as well as constant profane language, and it seems like the most popular comedies rely solely on vulgarity to make people laugh. When did this shift occur?

I assume it's in part because of the sexual revolution and counterculture of the sixties, but even films and tv shows from then and the 70s are still relatively "clean". What's the first film or tv show you can remember being extreme or profane? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Going into this season, I had read on this sub that Danni was a really underrated winner and that Stephenie tarnished her reputation. I didn't see these things at all through the season though. I thought Stephenie played a great game, and her only failures were jury management and people having a bias against or for her from the minute she started. I also don't understand why people praise Rafe so much, when his game was pretty much the exact same as Stephenie's...in fact, if you ask me, Rafe was more unbearable because he pretended the entire time like he was the good guy and he just couldn't stand to hurt people, but then he stabbed people's backs just as much as Stephenie? So I don't understand the doubles standard there.

I thin Danni is an average winner, but definitely not as great as this sub hypes her up to be. I think she doesn't deserve quite as much credit as she gets; a lot of her success seemed to be out of luck that the dominant alliance chose to target someone else rather than her.

Overall, this was a great season, and for sure underrated. It took a while to get into, and the boot order was somewhat unsatisfying in the middle, but it was a brutal season survival wise, and the characters were pretty entertaining. Definitely a middle of the road season. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What will lead to the downfall of Nintendo </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Nintendo has sold out. I understand it is a company's goal and responsibility to turn a profit and make money, and I know that Nintendo has had a rough time financially in recent years. Yet still, Nintendo has started to make games with a focus on attracting a wider audience and making money rather than making games for the art of video games. It is because of this Paper Mario has completely lost its way from the beloved roots of the series, it is because of this that the past years have seen an emphasis on DLC and Amiibos being shoved down our throats, it is because of this that a real Metroid game hasn't even been discussed in more than six years, and it is because of this that the Wii U was an overwhelming failure. I'm still holding out hope that Nintendo will save itself, and I want to still have trust in them. But if they continue down this path it's not going to bode well. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The first two episodes of this season seemed to drift away from the uber-strategic focus that Cambodia had, and instead were more character and survival based. This episode, though, started to become more strategic, with the beauty and brain tribes being shown forming alliances, or not forming alliances, and the brain tribe in particular having 6 people all propose different strategies to each other. This started with Liz, who many saw as a gamebot like Spencer. Liz was promptly cut free, though, and I'm hoping this is symbolic of the heavy strategy being shirked this season in favor of building characters and giving us comedic moments. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to deal with alcoholic family? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-14 04:37:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't even know where to start...I have an older brother and sister, and both of them, as well as my mom and dad, are alcoholics. They're not the worst possible alcoholics, i.e., they all have jobs and are functioning members of society, but they get drunk pretty much every night and start drinking in the morning on the weekends.

I'm just not even sure what to do anymore. Every time I come home from college it's worse. It's like I have to watch my family self-destruct and there's nothing I can do about it. Last summer, on vacation, I was pretty miserable because they were always drunk and having to stop at bars (I understand it's a vacation, but I'm not kidding when I say if they saw a bar at our hotel they had to stop at it). I confronted them, albeit a little harshly and in a bad place, and they shrugged it off, getting mad at me for "labelling" or "judging" them,trying to point out my flaws as well, and making fun of me for being a "puritan". Since then I've pretty much given up trying to confront them about it because I hate confrontation and it seems like they aren't going to listen ever. 

Like I said, it gets worse every time I'm around them. They get drunker, and faster, using excuses like holidays and weekends. Tonight there was a ton of drama that happened because they were all drunk and the fighting escalated because none of them were capable of acting rational.

I'm at my wits' end. I feel so helpless in all of this, and I love my family; I don't want them to crash and burn like they are on track to do. The thing that's exasperating is they point out the behavior in other people all the time, but are completely unable to look introspectively and realize they are doing the same thing. Please, any advice would be appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, so I'm currently replaying banjo tooie for the first time in like 8 years, and I'm at jolly roger's lagoon, and I swear to god I'm gonna lose my mind. This is the most frustrating boss ever. Like first of all, you swim ridiculously slow compared to him, so the time you have where you're not running away from him and not spinning out of control because you touch him is ridiculously small. So you have barely any time to shoot those fucking boils. But I swear whoever decided on the aiming controls in this game I wish I could breegull blast them into oblivion. Not to mention the hitbox is so tiny on each boil and the fish is moving in every direction making it impossible to aim.

But that's not difficult enough. Noooooooo nooooo noooo it has to be 10x harder. Because once you finish popping those nasty ass boils guess what? You're only half way through this nightmare! And it gets harder! Now it's even harder to avoid his attacks, and you have less of an opportunity to hit an even smaller hitbox. Oh, and there's only one fucking honeycomb the entire fight.

Fuck this. Sorry, I just needed to rant somewhere.  </TEXT>

Normally, if a friend asked me this same question, I would 100% tell them to tell the wife, because I feel it's the right thing to do. However, now that I'm actually in the situation, I'm realizing the power of doing that; I'd be at least casting a lot of doubt into a relationship, but at most, destroying it. And I would be causing a lot of trouble in the life of a little girl. And I don't know if I can handle doing that.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yes, I'm already doing this five days into the offseason. This idea is partially taken from something I saw on this sub, but here's my idea:

1st Chances vs. 2nd Chances vs. 3rd Chances vs. 4th Chances vs. 5th Chances.

I know it sounds ridiculous, but stick with me. The season starts with 18 Contestants: 4 tribes of 4 (the 1st-4th Chances) and Rob and Rupert, the 2 fifth chances, start out on Exile Island alone. They remain there for the first six days, until there are only 16 castaways left. At this point, there is a tribe swap in which Rob and Rupert come from Exile Island and do a schoolyard pick of people until there are only two left. These two then go to Exile Island and there are two tribes of 7. These two return at the next immunity challenge, and at every immunity challenge from then until the merge at 10, each tribe picks a person from the other tribe to go to Exile. 

The jury starts at 9, and in each episode after that point, the winner in each immunity challenge chooses one person to go to Exile, and that person returns after tribal council. They can't choose themselves. This continues until the final 6, and the season ends up with a F2 and a jury of 7.

As for the cast, Rob and Rupert would be the fifth chancers, and the first chancers would all be newbies, but I would pick Cirie, Stephenie, Colby, and Russell as the 4th chancers, Laura Morett, Shirin, Ethan Zohn, and Yau-Man as the 3rd chancers, and Katie Collins, T-Bird, Todd Herzog, and Matty as the 2nd chancers. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why __ is not a goat (spoilers) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-19 04:08:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Everyone and their mother is going on and on about how Tasha was a goat this season and how she got dragged to the end, but I'm wondering what the basis of this belief is. Even ignoring her premerge game, in which she got shafted by a tribe swap, but still stayed strong, went from the bottom and minority of her tribe to the top without any hidden immunity idols or immunity of any kind, then returned to her old tribemates and still managed to fit back in to her old alliance.

No, even if you don't count that, her postmerge game was still excellent. She was responsible for two threats going home (Kass and Abi), and to an extent, a third (bringing up how everyone liked Kelly Wiglesworth and how she was a threat at the reward challenge) and she continually kept her alliance strong and on track. If Jeremy hadn't had the idols, she would have been the leader of her alliance. She literally was only left out of the vote once. Meanwhile, everyone is talking about how Spencer is some strategic threat that screwed things up for himself when really he was more of a goat than Tasha ever was. The one chance he had to make a move he decided to stick with his alliance and vote out Abi. The only thing I can think of that he really did strategically post merge was get out Wiglesworth, but even then, he was going along with two stronger players plans!

It's like people are judging how good of a player everyone is on their preconceived notions of each castaway and how the jury acted rather than based on how they actually played the game. Tasha deserves far, far more credit than she is actually getting.

EDIT: Obviously there's some disagreement as to what a goat is, so here's a definition everyone should be able to agree on: someone who is taken to the end by another player because they will receive few if any votes from the jury and are therefore easy to win against. Here's the thing though: while Tasha was easy to win against for Jeremy, and she would receive no votes against Jeremy, that's not all it takes to make someone a goat. Tasha was not taken to the end by Jeremy, aside from maybe the final four tribal council. Besides that, Tasha took Jeremy and Spencer to the final three. She could have gotten rid of them and she took them to the end. Tasha is not a goat because someone who makes their own way to the end and gets no votes is not a goat; someone who is dragged to the end because they won't get any is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll preface this by saying this is one of my favorite survivor seasons of all time. It had so much to love about it. However, what's really holding it back from being my favorite or in the top three is the editing. Watching the final ponderosa videos, I'm really seeing how much we missed in terms of characters. So much of the airtime was devoted to strategy and to producing an obvious winner's edit for jeremy (which is frustrating in itself because it completely destroyed the momentum of twists and blindsides the season had going for it for a while) that half of the cast was completely forgotten about. I think had they included more even editing and moments that weren't strategizing from more characters, this really would have been the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been a Tasha fan this entire time, but it's like day and night going back and watching this video. I don't think Tasha is a bad person at all, but I don't understand why she's acting like this. I think a large part of it is that her goal coming into this season was to not play nice and to be more aggressive and more of a villain, and this is the result of that. I don't think Tasha is a condescending person or an unpleasant person, I think that she's here to play this time, not to make friends. It's a questionable strategy, as I'm not exactly sure whether or not her being nice was her downfall then, but I wish more people on this sub would realize that this isn't her personality, it's her playing the game, rather than constantly bashing her and hating on her. Considering what Stephen and Savage have said about her, too, I think the edit is playing a large part in her portrayal this season, which is a shame. </TEXT>

Then Joe went home at the next tribal unanimously, and his lone dissenting vote was for Abi. Now, Abi was voted off. The person with the second most votes has gone home each week. Maybe this season isn't as twisty as it seems.

I hope this pattern doesn't hold true next week with Tasha going home... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just...I don't understand. The first half of this season was so great, but then it just devolved into meaningless shit that had no foundation and came completely out of left field.

I entered this finale with an open mind, and the first half was great, but then it just completely went to shit again. What I don't understand is why people are still jacking off to it and calling it the best thing they've ever seen. It's like people aren't even trying to be critical at all and are just ignoring every negative aspect of the show this season. 

Is no one going to mention that somehow Kevin is just invincible and can't be killed? 

Is no one going to mention the fact that he had a bullet shot straight through his abdomen and was somehow able to get up and walk around like normal? 

Is no one going to mention how he somehow forgave John for shooting him five seconds after he came back from the dead? 

Is no one going to mention that the show isn't even concerned with the departure anymore? 

Is no one going to mention the makers of the show are just throwing in random earthquakes for no apparent reason now? 

Is no one going to mention how the show completely threw away the ambiguity that it created for the first one and a half seasons and is a completely different show now? 

All of this can't be considered anything more than shitty, shitty writing, and it infuriates me that everyone is so caught up with, "Ooh, symbolism!" and, "Ooh, deeper meanings!" that they're completely ignoring that the past few episodes have been incredibly, incredibly, incredibly flawed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't seen every season, but I have seen most, and from what I've seen, Todd is one of the best, if not the best, winners I have ever seen on survivor. He knew what he was doing from start to finish and executed his game brilliantly. 

And yet I've never seen him talked about on here. When people are asked who the best winner is, everyone brings up Tony, a few fans mention Parvati, and I've heard people talking about Chris a bit, but I've never seen anyone mention Todd. It could just be because I'm talking about a season that's seven years old, but people bring up older winners than that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's true that the finale on the 16th will be the final six rather than five, is it possible that FTC could have a final four rather than three for the first time? And maybe that's what Savage was talking about when he said something would happen that's never happened before? On one hand, I feel like that would be too chaotic, and just...weird. On the other, I can't see them eliminating 3 people and having a FTC in two hours, and given Jeff's comments on the 13 merge, when he stated that he wanted to give as many of the castaways as possible a chance as a reward for campaigning so hard, it seems possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dan outplayed Stephen. I wasn't a big fan of stephen for most of this season, but started having massive respect for him these two episodes seeing the hell he was going through physically, and how he grit his teeth and stuck through it. So I'm not necessarily saying Stephen played bad.

BUT both Dan and Stephen were voted out right after using their advantage. Stephen's was stronger than Dan's because he could steal a vote rather than just adding one. And the only reason Dan went home is because Carolyn played an immunity idol. No one played an idol for Stephen. So even though Stephen's was stronger, and even though no one played an idol to counter it, he still went home.

Trust me, I hate to say anything good about Dan. But splitting the votes tonight was a huge mistake. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems like everyone is gushing over this episode and saying it's the best thing they've ever seen but I'm so frustrated. This episode came completely out of the blue, does not match the tone or subject of the rest of the series at all, and completely threw away every dramatic question this series was using to its benefit.

I guess what makes me mad is how awful Damon Lindelof is at sticking to his word. With Lost, we were promised answers, and in the end we barely got anything. Then with this, we were told that we would never get answers, that this series wasn't about answers, and the entire first season was spent convincing the audience to be okay with that, and then suddenly we're being hit over the head with answers.

Don't get me wrong, I thought the episode by itself was entertaining and well-done, but it's not an episode of the leftovers, and I absolutely hate that the series has taken this turn. Going back to the real world now, everything is going to feel so cheap. Why should we care about any of the characters' struggles when we know that they're stressing over nothing and all of their issues can just be solved magically? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-11-16 12:23:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Everyone's talking about how they think that Virgil is going to guide Kevin through hell or the afterlife, but I don't think this is what is going to happen for two reasons: 

1. That would be way too obvious. How easy is it to search the name Virgil, learn about Dante's Inferno, and then suddenly know the whole plot? I don't think that the writers would foreshadow that strongly. 

2. It doesn't fit the tone or theme of the show at all. The whole show relies on realism and focusing only on what we as humans know. Yes, it has people who claim to be magic, and it has religion in it, but it treats those things skeptically and like they would be treated in the real world. It would be out of place if suddenly it was shown as fact that Virgil and Kevin went to the afterlife in order to banish some ghost. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For Tasha and Savage, voting out Peih-gee over Abi was not a smart move. Going forward, the two will have Abi, Woo, and Varner at their disposal to work with. Abi, though, isn't going to work with Woo because he voted for her, and isn't going to work with Varner because she thinks he was being shady at the challenge. Woo, likewise, isn't going to work with Abi because he doesn't like her and she voted off PG, and won't work with Varner because he never goes to him to talk. And then there's Varner, who it seems like no one wants to work with right now. This means that no matter which path Tasha and Savage take, they will only have one ally, for a 3 vs. 2 situation.

If they had kept PG, they could have worked with both PG and Woo, and gotten out Savage next. That would have been a 4 vs. 1 situation. Sure, they aren't in trouble, but having better numbers is always better, not to mention the fact that Abi is unpredictable and reckless, so working with her in the first place will be hard to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, I've been an emotional rollercoaster recently. I started my second year of college about a week ago and was actually really happy. But just like that I'm feeling depressed and worthless all over again.

A little bit of background, a few months ago I pretty much opened up to my friends and said I had been depressed for a while. I asked no one to say anything about it because I didn't want attention. But I think I really did. And everyone did just that, they didn't say anything about it. But I feel like even if a friend says they don't want to talk about something as serious as that, that you still should?

Anyways, this week I met someone who I thought would be the one who I could care about the most and who would actually care about me just as much. I've been really lonely lately; I have friends, I just don't feel like I can depend on them. That person told me tonight that they don't really want to talk to me.

Is it too much to ask for for one person in my life that will be there for me, no matter what? Idk. This probably all sounds pathetic. </TEXT>

But at this point, they just aren't. They aren't as funny, they aren't as charismatic, and they aren't as entertaining.

	<TEXT> I've watched adventure time since the beginning, and I loved it for its charm and spontaneity and how whimsical it is. Obviously, the show is very different now and is more focused on character development and plot and heavy themes. And it seems like all the fans are obsessed with this and hate the original nature of the show. It just makes me sad that all of these newcomers who wanted something totally different from the show came in and now there's next to no one left who liked the show as it originally was: A CARTOON. It annoys me that people are evaluating this show as if it's some serious artsy drama series for adults instead of a random, funny cartoon that didn't really care about things like developing characters. </TEXT>
