	<TEXT> Ahh yes, the first part of the game is indeed pretty sweet. 

Maybe I'm just too salty but Pandora, the Scorpion boss and the impossible Zeus fight (if you play on the highest difficulty) really take away much from my enjoyment of the game, the "hope" theme that came out of nowhere soured my impression as well. 

I'd recommend the game to people, it's not a bad game. It's pretty fun for what it is. I just think everything after Hades could've been done a lot better.  </TEXT>

I am curious to find out why they made the players have so little health. Is it because otherwise it would be too easy to roll over enemies since you could sponge up damage until you're near them?  </TEXT>

What happens if LC ulties an enemy hero and Weaver uses his ult on her?

	<TEXT> Currently I don't have time to play DotA but I've been thinking of taking Eul's first (after bottle and threads) and then going for Orchid for future games. Is that effective? I don't see anyone doing this. 

My reasoning is that you get a lot from Eul's and Orchid combined. You can rush into three enemies, eul's on, silence the other and pull the third. Not to mention the stats, slight movement speed boost and all the other applications. 
Or is that just that others do this but I haven't seen it because of my low MMR (2.5kMMR)?  </TEXT>

If I understood correctly the map isn't purely dota style. There are certain points at which you can summon minions that... do they move around? Are they like turrets? Do you have to capture a certain number of 'summoning points' on the map to make your guardian move? 

Can a Guardian kill another Guardian or is it up to the players to bring the finishing blow?

Are there any items or is it purely based on skill-trees?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello there, gentleman/gentleman-woman. 
I've recently picked up the habit of listening to podcasts while taking public transport or doing mundane housework like vacuuming or polishing my walls. It helps me pass the time and makes me look forward to an otherwise boring activity.
 
I've only started recently but I have been listening to The Cooptional Podcast (Totalbiscuit's "gaming" podcast) and the CollegeInfoGeek Podcast (it's about studying and being productive).

I'd fancy a few recommendations! Can be about comedy, science, history, studying, engineering, books, movies, productivity, socializing and travel. If you have anything to recommend I'll be glad to give it a chance. 

I'll be looking forward to some nice listening materials, cheers!  

EDIT - or just recommend one of your favorites, would love it if it's about a specific theme.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I may be able to help you with this. 

Stop treating your schedule as a list of suggestions but as something that has to be done.
 
Lets say you usually make a schedule with 10 points through the whole day but you only manage to do 4 of those at best.
 
Start very simple, make a schedule with 4 goals for a day. You have to clearly define those goals and write down steps for achieving them. Lets say  doing 5 math problems before lunch:

Prepare work area, remove distractions

Prepare books and notebooks
 
Get two problems done in an hour (take 15 min break)

Get two more problems done in an hour (take 15 min break)

Finish the last problem

This is a really simple version of it and I hope it helps. Keeping it simple while making it more challenging as you achieve your goals will keep you working. 

EDIT - last time I ever post on the phone, will format this later

EDIT 2 - formatted   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think afk farming is all that fun so I made my own PL build that enables me to be active in every team fight. 

Starting: tango + 2 branches + wand or salve (which one you prefer)

Early: Aquila - Treads - Urn - Vlad's (if there's someone else building this one just skip it)

Core: Diffusal - Basher

Late: Boots of Travel - whatever your heart desires. Almost all late game items work on him. 

The early game build I made gives you more hp and mana regen so you're not a complete paper towel and you can even join fights. 
I've been messing with the idea to replace Vlad's with Drums but I don't want to sacrifice the lifesteal. 

So far this build has been working great for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> tl;dr - your goals are idealized and don't take into consideration the time and effort necessary to achieve them. Replace them with small achievable goals that will challenge you a bit more every day. 


Most people on this sub have the same problem, it's that they set too high goals. 
Having a dream and a goal to strive for is great, it's something that many people still haven't figured out. You know what's even better? Having a realistic goal that doesn't tear at you from the inside because you are nowhere near accomplishing it. 

You know what that goal is? It's an ideal, a perfect setting that doesn't take into account all the hard work and time you have to put into it. 

Also something I've encountered is that people hold themselves to too high standards. Not in an arrogant *'I'm better than anyone'* way but more of *'I have to do better than anyone else if I wish to achieve'*. 

You are not a machine, you will make **countless mistakes** in the future on which you will build your achievements. Every single misstep will build a stronger education and character if you are committed to learning from your failures. 

So you want to know how to escape the negativity? The problem is that your victories are few and far between? 

Three things my friends: **short term planning**(as in planning out things to achieve in the next 7 days), **doable clearly defined goals** (not something vague as *'I'll strive to be a morning person'* but *'to wake up two days in a row before 8'*) and to **factor in mistakes with your planning** (you think you need and hour and a half to learn? Do you plan to start at the exact same moment when you've set out to? You sure? Better make it 2 hours and fifteen minutes). 

Your achievable goals aren't here to keep you in one place. You're supposed to set a new one when you've achieved the other. 
Something like this: Set apart 15 min in your day to repeat chemistry. (holy shit you did it!)

Next goal: Set apart 20 min in your day to repeat chemistry. (you've already done 15 min, what's another 5 to you?)

There is a lot to go over but currently the best place to get some advice is from a very helpful mate that uses this sub frequently: [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/user/electrickeye91)

Be realistic and don't hate yourself because of mistakes. Everyone is human, everyone makes mistakes, **everyone will continue to make mistakes**. 
The only difference that matters is that you realize that it will never be perfect so don't be upset over that unreachable idealized goal. Worry about doing just a bit more every day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Put it in a far away part in your room and put something over it that doesn't block the sound, that way you have to get out of bed to make it stop. 
   

When it comes to going to bed, what helped me was to set up a clear 'me time'. Me time starts at 20:00 and lasts till 22:00, it's when I surf the web, play games or watch shows. 

22:00 is lockdown, you can even put an alarm for going to bed. 

Having rituals helps you get in and out of bed. Three simple things would be a good start. I don't have one for bed but for the morning it's get up, open the curtains, drink water, stretch, meditate for 5 min, breakfast, dishes and then I plan my day. 
The point is to set up short doable things that you can keep track of if you succeed. 

A habit becomes a habit after 21 days of repetition. Should be fully engraved by round 60 days. </TEXT>

Based on the previews we've been shown I'm suspecting that most of Dark Souls fans will be put of by the quicker and more aggressive battle system (also the fact that it may be easier since you can get health back instantly by just hitting back).

However it will draw in people that are fans of the DMC series, think action fans in general.  </TEXT>

Could you explain why they're at 'Egoraptor's level'? Has there been a decline in their quality? 

I remember that time they praised Dark Souls 2 for everything the fans didn't like about it. Other than that I can't come up with much right now. Because I like them I am biased to their faults so am interested to see what I'm missing.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Have games helped you develop real life skills? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> **Tl;dr** - playing stealth games has greatly improved the way I organize time and do my studies. How have you benefited from gaming? Has it inspired you to draw, read, animate, improve your social skills or something completely different? I want to know. 

*The story of why I'm asking:*

I love playing stealth games, specifically I love playing with style. What I mean by that is that if I see a room with three guards, which I can easily skip, I'll make an elaborate attempt to take 'em out in the most fancy way. Create a distraction, kill one of them by jumping on him from high, knocking the second guy out and appearing in front of the third to alarm him and instantly dispose of him. That's the plan, I'm sticking to it. 

If I fail, for instance alerting the third guy as I'm taking out the second, I'll immediately load a save file and try it again... doing the exact same thing step by step, only faster. 

I was playing **Styx: Master of Shadows** (a diamond in the rough, great and fun game with a surprisingly solid story) and I was stuck in a room because I was constantly trying to solve it the same way. A guard on a higher vantage point kept spotting me as I was disposing of his two comrades. Avoiding his gaze could be achieved if only I could drag one of the bodies fast enough over the edge into a pit. I tried plenty of times, failing enough to get frustrated. 

You can probably already tell how insane my actions were, doing the same action over and over expecting different results.  

That's where it hit me, why not do it completely differently this time. There are several routes in this area, I can't get to the guy that spots me because on the way there the other two guards will notice me. Lets find a different route, dispose of the mate who has been foiling my plans and then repeat what worked from the previous run. It worked and I had more fun. 

Suddenly I realized how wrong my approach to games in general was, it was an epiphany. If you fail try smarter, not harder. This realization extended into several others. If you fail, don't try to get a different result by doing the same thing. Give yourself a chance to play imperfectly. The point isn't to 'win', it's to be better than when you started. I was playing for a long time and realized that after a certain point I wasn't enjoying myself so setting up a gaming time of 45 min worked great. 

I'm an engineering student and I've been having trouble with college. Applying the things that I learned from that session helped me a lot in improving the quality and quantity of my work. The results were immediate. 
It also helped me to enjoy other games more.

	<TEXT> I went to a psych yesterday to ask how to get tested. Am in the same boat as you (but I'm 20M, engineering), I needed support from others so I told a couple of close friends what I was planning on doing and even my uncle because I thought that at least one person in my family should know. 

Now if it turns out that there's nothing wrong with me I'll have no idea what to say to them. 
However I'm really glad I did it and it was pretty easy to ask for a test. 

Even if it turns out that I have ADD it just means that I'll have to push myself even more than before. 
You'll find that I asked the same thing a week or so ago in my history, I'm saying go for it before you're in your second year of college and everything starts to fall apart.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The Venture Bros.**

It's about Rusty Venture, a boy adventurer that became a failed super scientist, his bodyguard Brock Samson who is a total badass and the Venture Bros. who are completely out of touch with the world due to their sheltered and antique upbringing. 
 
I can't remember what made me watch it. I've been hearing about this show from time to time the last two years but never committed to watching more than a clip. 

I marathoned  all 5 seasons in 3-4 days. It's brilliant to say the least. It's funny, it has a great story, the character development is incredible and every season is better than the last one with the exception of season 5 not having a proper season finally (presumably going to be aired as a special). 

The season 4 ending is one of the bests I've seen in television. I'm really sad that I ran through the series so fast because I don't think I really appreciated some episodes due to almost skipping them because I wanted more of the story.  

Would recommend everyone to watch it. 

If you do decide to give it a shot remember to always watch the after credits scene. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone, I'll tell you about my problem but here are my specs: 

laptop - HP 450

Windows 8, 64 bit

Display adapters: AMD Radeon HD 8750M, Intel(R) HD graphics 4000 

Processor: Intel i5

RAM 8GB

I was having trouble with Catalyst Control Center not working properly but that seems to be somehow gone now. There are several other issues that bother me.

First of, whenever I right click on something it takes 30 secs for the right click bar to load and during that time if I'm opening inside a folder the folder will not respond. 

Other problem I'm having is that my screen sometime resets. Everything I'm doing fades and the only thing left is my wallpaper. Then a second later everything is back to normal. It does this on a random basis. 

I tried to fix everything by updating my display adapters drivers to the most recent ones. That didn't do much. I tried disabling them, restarting the PC and enabling them again but to no success. 
Can anyone help?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not particulary fond of the kind of content that makes it to the front page and I'm looking for a smaller sub where discussion is encouraged while there is also talk about the newest patch and tournaments. 

Better example: I'm looking for a sub that is to r/dota2 what r/games is to r/gaming (I am aware that r/games has several hundrets of thousand of subcribes but I'm fond of the way its users interact) 

EDIT due to u/anatem 's suggestion:

It's become too large and there is too many joke posts and not a single discussion.
Threads have become joke fests and have hate trains (some of them deserved, I guess). It's no longer about discussing plays, pubs or individual heroes. You get a free pass with "Omni sucks.". Boom, 5 upvotes, no explanation needed.

I also dislike how everybody assumes the worst in people. I posted a thread about how if it's stupid that you lose MMR if someone from your team leaves in the first 5 min. I got bashed and told that I deserve to play with such people without anything else said.

Today someone commented on the poor state of reports and people attacked him. They weren't interested in what happened or why he reported anyone. Go through my comment history and you should find that one.

There are too many of us and as such everyone leaves it to someone else to make the sub a better place.

This isn't an exclusive dota problem, it's just what happens when a subreddit (or any forum) becomes too large. </TEXT>

I was revising one of the two subjects when I remembered that I should confirm my registration in the school's system before Wednesday when it locks down. I'm from Croatia, the examination process works a bit different. 

As I found out ten minutes ago, Wednesday is the last day for withdrawing your application, not applying. Writing this down is my way of not having a nervous breakdown. But I might as well. Think it's better to just keep learning something else. 

Now I have to wait till February 2015 until I can participate in the exams which is also the time when the second year exams are being held.

We're learning to use the programming language Python as our professors say it's quite useful but I'm wondering if it really is and if I should learn another programming language with it. 

If I should, should I do try learning it after my lectures on Python end or should I try and cram it side by side?

I'm trying to climb out but the last three ranked games I played one of our carrots abandoned the vegetable garden. Oh, it's safe to leave alright, but it still counts as a loss. And MMR reduction.

I just want to know why we get the reduction even tho the game is supposedly safe to leave?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi there mates! I'm trying to learn how to play Clockwerk and would be thankful for some suggestions, tips and advice on play-style and builds. 

I play him in the offlane starting with stout shield and tangos. I try to keep my mana pool high enough until I hit level 6 where I try to sneak away for my first gank. Currently I'm trying to perfect my cog timing so I can use it to bounce of enemy heroes instead of trapping them with me. 

My early to mid game build is Phase Boots and an upgraded Wand, then Blade Mail. I'm thinking exchanging Blade Mail for Mek and go for a Blink as the next item. 

My problem is that sometimes I feel too weak, I can't do enough damage or I die too easily. I'm starting to think that it's not smart to initiate fights with Clock unless you're going for a gank but it could be because I'm building him wrong. 

I'm never sure what to get for late game after Aghs, I normally decide on Shiva's. 

Anyways, would love to hear what you guys have to say, thanks in advance! 

EDIT:
Thanks for the advice. I've incorporated most of it into two games I played today.
Still haven't had a chance to test out an orchid in any build. Will be aiming for that next!  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello everyone, I'm here because I currently can not take my pet to the vet and I'm feeling terrible because I can't ease his pain. 

My dog's name is Thor, he is a two and a half year old labrador retriever that weights about 50-55 kg. We live in Croatia (Europe) near a river. He's an outside dog and he's not allowed inside of the house. 


This is the second year in a row that he has suffered from a skin allergy and this year it's much worse on him because he's in a constant state of stress. He winces and cries a lot and it breaks my heart. I can't seem to determine what causes the allergy so I've come here to ask for advice until I can take him to the vet on Monday. 

The weird part about the allergy is that it's only on his right front foot and right side of his face so my theory is that he comes into direct contact with whatever is causing it. 

My mom wants to treat him with a medicine for humans (against allergies) and I'm strongly against it. 



Here are pictures so you can see what I'm taking about. The first one is of our garden, the second and third of his sleeping place, fourth and fifth are where he naps in our basement so he can avoid the sun while he has the plastic on his head and the rest are of him and his condition.

	<TEXT> I haven't been at this for long, only since Sunday but dammit if all the post in here and advice didn't make me pull myself up. This is the most serious try I took in bettering myself, trying to make myself work and developing discipline. 

For instance one of the things that has been making me the happiest so far is the fact that I started reading again (Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy by John le Carre if anyone was wondering) and I plan to do a LOT more than that. 
I just want to say thank you to everyone who contributes, be they just saying that they want to get disciplined, giving advice or sharing their success.

But I do have two questions. It's about positive thinking and being proud of the things you've done (however small they may be) and about my social life. 

I'm pretty nervous by nature and over the years I've developed a mind that is pretty rough on myself to avoid getting arrogant. I want to be less nervous and I want to make the voice in my head more balanced, less strict towards my actions but still harsh enough to call me out on my bullcrap. I also want to be more positive cause often times I read people saying that a positive outlook on their situation got them very far, how do you change your view on things that you think of as:"Well, it really wasn't a big deal to do that, anyone could."? People who made the change or are trying to change the same thing, what helps with this? 

The next is about social interactions, meeting new people or strengthening old bonds. At the beginning of your journey how much did you focus on progressing your relationships? I moved to our country's capital to study engineering and I live on my own. I have a SO, family and really good friends back home which I keep in regular contact with. Except for my OS and brother, I'm cool with the relationships staying at the level they are. I'm mostly interested in how you handled the social aspect of your life when you started working on yourselves?

Thank you in advance for your replies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, I'm a Croatian engineering student and I would like to ask you about to fields that are available at my college.
One being Mechatronics and robotics and the other being designing medical equipment. 

I'm gonna be straight here, I want to be working on stuff similar to what's presented in Deus Ex:Human Revolution. To be more precise, I would love to be able to work with robots and technology and at the same time with the human brain and nervous system. 

Will one of these two fields make it possible for me to do so?

Also if you could point me out some colleges that are particularly strong in these fields or a place I could look it up myself I would be very grateful. Plus points if they're german colleges, I have a DSD (deutsches sprach diploma) so I think that would work best for me. </TEXT>
