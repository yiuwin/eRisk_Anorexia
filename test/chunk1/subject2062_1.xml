They all have really good videos. Except zefrank they all teach you something and even if you can't use these things everyday they are nice to know. zefrank has one amazing voice and the topics of his videos are really great. Beside his awesome "True facts" show, which always cheers me up when I'm down. Seriously I just have to watch a few "True facts" and I'm crying for laughter. Go check them out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm also German and all I can do is warn you, because there are many false friends (e.g. middg which means dinner and not noon (for the non-German speakers: noon is Mittag in German)).

I can recommend babbel.com if you want to learn it on your own terms. It's quite cheap and the lessons are really good. Also since you have people around who speak Swedish they can help you with questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently learning Swedish and after I pick that up to a level where I can navigate through Sweden and talk with Swedes without the need of a dictionary or any kind of translation device I think I'll go for Dutch.

The reason for Swedish is that I have friend there and I want to visit the country often. For Dutch, well I currently live like 20mins from the Dutch-German Border, so I think it would be nice to be able to speak it. </TEXT>

Tyska har fler artiklar, beroende p kon och fall av ordet. De flesta tyskar inte fr det rtt. Vi har tjugotta artiklar totalt.

I think we should write in English, because I can write/speak it better than Swedish. The more languages you know the better you can pull it off, because then you can choose one language which is most likely not spoken by the locals.

	<TEXT> In the year 2013 ~95% of all trains of the DB that year had a delay of under 6 minutes and for ~99% the delay was under 16 minutes.

However if you just look at the long range inter-city trains (ICE/IC/EC) it doesn't look as good anymore ~74% of all trains had a delay under 6mins and ~90% had a delay of under 16 minutes.

But then again one has to keep in mind that in 2013 in Essen there were some kind of mining damage which had a huge impact on the whole Ruhr Area regarding trains. 

All in all I never understood how and why people complain so much about the DB. For the last 6-8 years I have been commuting with the DB and only very few times problems because the train was delayed and then most of the time it wasn't really the fault of the DB (e.g. emergency on the train tracks [aka someone was hit by a train] or stuff like that)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see the problem in #10 if I don't like tomatoes is it really being a asshole to ask if they could leave them out?

To be more clear: I will ask for it and not demand it e.g. I'll say something like this "I would like the xyz salad, but without tomatoes if possible". I won't be offended if they are still in it, but it makes it harder for me to eat, because I will let them lay on my plate and move them around as I eat. So in the end I have a plate with tomatoes on it. I then often think that it may look like I didn't really like the food, which is not true for the most part.

So please could someone tell what the best way is to ask if some part of the meal should be left out? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm lying to myself about my feelings and intentions. I'm doing this so I can easier lie to the people around me if they ask me how I feel or what I intend to do. The lying ranges from "You'll take care of that hole in the wall tomorrow" to "The cut with the razor near your carotid was an accident and not intentional".

I know that these are lies I tell myself, but somehow I still tell them to myself and the more often I repeat them the more I believe them, but that does not make them true, because the cut was not an accident, my hand did not slip or anything like that, I just wanted to feel the pain. I lie to myself that the plans on how I could end my life are nothing but quick thoughts, but I know that I have it in me to take the actions for one of these plans. 

I lie to myself that I don't have the time to look for a therapist right now, because of work, but I know, that I could just take the time I need for it. I lie to myself, that the loss of my job is not bothering me that much, but on the same note I'm not sure what to do. I lie to myself that I'm not afraid to fall in love again, but I know that I am. I lie to myself about so much that I sometimes don't even know if I'm lying or not anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I hit my rock bottom around the age of 14. It's a bit complicated, but I try to explain it as short and simple as possible.

My parents divorced when I was 7 and I never told anybody about how I felt. Until today I never really did. All in all that were the first steps I took towards my fall. I had aggression problems, because all of the emotions stored up in me, but I learned to cope with it. I didn't tell anybody how I felt, so nobody really knew how good I was. For my family and school friends I always looked like a joyful young boy, but that was just a role I played. On the inside I always felt alone and most of the time I was kind of sad. I didn't really have friends outside of school and most of my time I spent on my computer, playing Everquest 2 (for the ones who don't know it's an MMORPG). I played with a group of awesome people, most of them were older than me. In this group of people was one whole family and there was this girl. She was my age, I think a year younger, and we got along really really well. We had several characters, which we only played with each other. You could say that if she and I were online we played together.

I fell in love with her, but the distance between us was to much, so I never pursued a relationship beyond the friendship we had. But the gaming took more and more place in my life. I called in sick on school to stay at home. I stayed up way to late and was all sleepy in the school. You could say the center of my life was the game. There I could be what I wanted to be, there I had friends, there, I thought, were people who really cared for me. In the end it took it's toll and I nearly failed school. My mother not so happy about it, said that I was not allowed to play anymore until my grades got better. My world shattered. How should I be able to do anything? How should I have fun?

I tried three times to take my life in the matter of a few months. For me, there was no reason to live anymore. They took all that I cared for away from me, at least that's what I thought back then. However all my attempts failed for different reasons.

In the end I realized that the game was not my life and that I had other things I could live for. But I never fully recovered. I think I'm still recovering, since the game was just the thing that triggered it. I have serve problems, but I'm working on them and I hope that someday I'm able to say, that I recovered the best I can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if there are tournaments where you can participate without this test, but you need the test to be allowed to fight in tournaments of the DFB (German fencer association).

The test is in two different parts. The first part is about the rules and stuff. So you know how to fill out the tableau and to check if everything is correct in it. The second part is about the fencing itself, to see if you know the basic techniques and stuff. 

Well I wish you best of luck and after all if you have fun that's all that matters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not the one who ended it, but I was the reason.

Our time together was rather short, but for me it was kind of special. I'm not really an outgoing person normally. But with her it was different. Everything was different with her, from the first moment I wrote with her up to the first moment I lay my eyes on her. We met through online dating and wrote roughly 2 months before we decided it was time to meet up.

Our first date was awesome. We had fun and a great time and after the second date we both agreed to try a relationship. For me this was the first relationship in a bit over 2 years and even before that I only had like 2 relationships, so I'm pretty unexperienced about it all. Because of work we could only see each other on the weekends, but these weekends were awesome. Up until our 5th weekend together. I was coming right off from work and because of stress I was kind of tired and my mood was not the best, however when I saw her at least my mood got up again. But the weekend was doomed to be shitty. I had headaches all weekend long, and because I'm stupid I thought to hide it from her to not look weak. It didn't go to well and we kind of have a little fight on Sunday, however nothing to bad and we clear it between us before I have to leave.

We played WoW together and on Monday we had a little fight over it, nothing to serious, but my brain made a big deal out of it. She is pissed at me. It looks like I was clingy or whatever in the week and somehow, however I didn't knew it up until the Sunday of that week. We couldn't see each other on Friday and Saturday, because she had work to do on these days, so to at least clear the little fight in person I come over to her on Sunday.

We talk about the fight and stuff and again over the weekend before. I'm telling her how bad I feel because of it. Well to no avail, because she says she doesn't feel like before for me anymore. All the feelings she had for me apparently went to hell in that week.

So now I'm sitting here still feeling for her and I just wish I could change all of the shit that went down. I wish, that she finds her feelings for me again and we can start over, not new, but now we know how to handle a few things. I wish someone would offer me weekend like the first ones with her and I would give that person everything I have.

Before that however I broke up with her, because she was a manipulative lying bitch, who destroyed more than any other person in my live before. Because of her I didn't talk to my oldest friend for roughly a year, because of her I lost a job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was the first few times confused when I watched foil, because of the right of way rules. But after I got the hang of them it's even more amazing than epee. However for myself it's a bit to complicated I think, so I chose the epee.

But I must confess I never got to fight in a tournament, because of different reasons I had to leave my fencing club short before I had the test for tournament allowance. I don't know if it's the same where you are from, but here in Germany you have to take a test before you can fight in official tournaments. It's about the rules and basic fighting techniques, so that you don't endanger yourself or others, also I think it's so that you have some kind of ground level in the tournaments. </TEXT>

Then I remember that I still have to find a therapist and how much work it is and that I may need to tell my dad, who I live with, why I don't feel like doing anything currently. *sigh* So much shit to do and so few(Is that right?

	<TEXT> Well fellow German here and I have to disagree with you.

Sure we have many and more different types of beer here, but we don't drink the most beer in the world. Brezeln are more common in the south, namely in Bavaria, in most other states it's not as common.

Bratwurst however is very common in different shapes, so yeah Bratwurst is true. Not only Bratwurst, but Wurst in general is kind of a goto food here in Germany, when it has to be relatively cheap and fast. </TEXT>

For clarification: Here in Germany when you are employed and sick, the first 6 weeks your employer has to pay you normally, after the 6 weeks your insurance pays you I think 80% of your pay in the last 3 months or so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 23, currently living on the western edge of Germany near the Netherlands and Belgium. My current work till the end of March is being a C# programmer in a smallish company in a town nearby. I'm intereseted in nearly everything computer related. I love to programm (even through I don't do it anymore in my spare time), I love to play games and I love to read and inform myself about new things in the I.T. world. For the most part I enjoy multiplayer games over singleplayer games, because I love the interaction with different people. Beside the computer related stuff I also love reading, most of the time I read fantasy or sci/fi books.

My music taste is mostly Rock-based, but I also hear other genres, when I like the song. My favorite bands are for the most part German bands like Die rzte or Megaherz or Jennifer Rostock. So I don't know what else to put here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In one word: Everything

To be more specific. I tend to over-think everything that happens in my life. I'm thinking how I could change bad things or how I could've avoided it. I'm looking for errors in everything I do. For me there always has to be reason why. 

For example the Sunday before last I  was broken up with. Her and I talked about it and ever since I'm dwelling about the question if I could've prevented it and if how I could've. And I'm not meaning just thinking about it for a bit and then let it be without an answer. Last week I couldn't sleep because of this. I even ask her questions to get a clearer picture of what was wrong, but somehow I know I'll never get the complete picture, still I'm trying to get it.

The worst part about it is, that when I'm over-thinking most of the time I'm not eating good or anything at all. Last week I went 3 days straight without easting or drinking anything beside plain water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember several dreams of the night, so here are two in no particular order.

It was Fasching and for whatever reason I decided to go out. But before I did anything to get ready or go out I started to cut my arms with a knife until they bled. Because I didn't want to see anybody I wrapped the wounds in bandages and then proceeded to putting on my costume. I decided to wear some kind of outfit where the bandages did not interfere.
Fast forward a bit I'm out with my latest ex girlfriend, for whom I still have feelings, and some of her friends. We are having a blast and getting closer the whole time. We were touching each other nearly all the time, but then she grabbed my arm right on one of the self inflicted wounds and I had to hide the pain it put me in. She pulled me to the side to tell me something, but her grip was so tight that the wound started bleeding again and the blood went straight through the bandages. She notices it and starts to freak out and asks me about it. I can't lie to her, so I tell her the truth. Angry at me she storms out of the place we are and leaves me behind. I'm just standing there with the wound bleeding really strong. The blood drips down my arm onto the ground.

Well then here is number two. No surprise above mentioned ex is again in it. It's night and we are walking down a road talking. I don't remember the topic, but it was just a casual talk. We are just passing a dark corner, when some dude, with a long ass knife, jumps us and demands her to get naked and stuff like that. He threatens us to kill both of us if anyone tries anything. She wants to give in, because she doesn't want anybody to be hurt, but I can't stand that. I step in front of her and tell to her to slowly back away. She is baffled but does as I say. The guy get furious and wants to stab me. I move just so slightly to let the knife not touch me. This happens a few times before the dude throws himself against me and buries the knife in my stomach. Even through I'm hurt I'm still trying to hold him off and for some reason it works. Shortly after the police and the ambulance arrive and take him away. The emergency doctor tries his best to safe me. The last thing I remember from the dream is hearing her (my ex gf) say "Why wouldn't you let him have me you stupid idiot? Then I at least wouldn't have to fear someone I love" then I pass out.

The other dreams I only remember vaguely and from what I remember they are even darker. In the second dream I was kind of surprised not to wake up to the stabbing, because I felt the pain even after the dream ended and I woke up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Different small ones on arms and legs from scratching open mosquito bites and other smaller wounds. Two on my the right side of my lower lip from piercings that got infected, one across my index finger on the right hand, from when I was little and felt the need to go across the blade of a knife with it.

A bit darker now, several smallish scars on arms and legs from hurting myself, when I was down. The thing about these scars is, that the wounds itself would've healed perfectly but I always picked at them like the ones from the mosquito bites. Good thing is that nobody really notices them and thinks they are also from the mosquito bites.

The last one is kind of NSFW. It's on the lower part of my nut sack and the story involves a stupid 12 or 13 year old me, a hill, a bike and the railing of a bridge. So here it goes:

I was cycling with my mother and my aunt the whole day. Just a little tour and we visited my grandparents. My grandparents lived in a little village on top a hill, nothing to big but not small either. The slope we went down was very steep and well I was speeding it down without really breaking. What I did not think about was, that at the end we needed to cross a bridge and it was not straight from where we were coming but a right turn. Well I was way way to fast to take the turn and crashed into the railing of the bridge. Because I stood up in the last second before the impact my nuts went hard against the thing in the middle of the handlebars and for whatever reason there were shard edges.

Needless to say my nuts were bleeding and hurting like hell. I couldn't sit down for the rest of the trip, which lasted another 20-30mins. When I was home I decided to look at my nuts and well there was a wound in them. Nothing to bad, not bleeding anymore, but it was there. The next few days sitting was really painful and I had to watch out on how I sat down. In the end I now have a scar on my nut sack, but thanks to the exact spot nobody ever notices if I don't tell them. </TEXT>

I tend to use English with people who are not native German speakers, because they most likely can speak it way better than German and it will prevent strange situations. However if you speak German with me and make errors it's not that hard of an issue, I'll try to correct you and help you improve.

	<TEXT> It's German, in Germany it's not so common for the police to have weapons as the AR15 or a shotgun of tor that matter an SMG in plain sight in their car.

There are a few states where they have this kind of guns in the trunk of the car, but not embedded in the door like this, also I would bet nearly 100% of all police officers with such a weapon in the trunk never gonna need to get it out.

Don't compare the German police with the U.S. police in that regard, as in Germany a gun in general is seen as something special and we have pretty tight laws regarding owning, carrying and usage of guns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all I want to thank you for reading all through it. I wasn't sure if it made sense what I wrote, since I mostly wrote it how it came to my mind.

You are right, there are many things to live for, but right now it's hard for me to see them. Even through I love gaming (as in video games) and I like to listen to music and watch a movie, these things don't really fulfill me, if you understand what I mean. They give me joy and I forget my problems in the moment, but afterwards when I lay in bed or just have a moment where nothing occupies my brain, my thoughts go rampant.

Heck I don't want to fun things all day long, I know that it's not how it works. I know that rough times will pass by, that however is not something that helps me, I don't know why, but this talking about "You'll get through it/over it" never helped me.

I don't envy anyone, because I know everybody has their own problems and I'm aware that my problems are more or less self made problems of the world I live in. Not one of the things really threatens my life in a way millions and millions of other people have their live threatened right in this moments, however these problems are as real as theirs are. I'm not saying they are equal, they are far from it and if I had the power I would help all them to have as a good life as I have.

As I said above this "it will get better later" does, for whatever reason, not work for me. I can't take any comfort in knowing that it'll get better in live (be it because of a god or for what ever reason you can think of). It may be because I know that it does not always get better, sometimes it stays the same or even worsens.

I tried to do "risky" things like chatting up the cute girl I've seen everyday before I moved, but even through I know that I don't have anything to loose in the end there is some kind of blockage in my mind. The funny or sad thing is up until age 8 or 9 I was an outgoing child, I chatted up anybody and did not really mind. Even now if I'm 100% comfortable or I know I can retreat if I'm not comfortable I'm more open. 

For example I met my last girlfriend through an online dating platform, we chatted for a few month and finally met. On the way there I was nervous as hell. She was (and still is) beautiful, cute and well just damn near perfect and she messaged me first on the platform. When she arrived and stepped out of the car, all my nervous feelings were gone. I can't really explain it, but from the first moment on I felt really comfortable in her presence. Well not anymore I guess, since I blew it up.

*sigh* Well thanks again for your words and tips and everything. It helped at least a bit and maybe they'll get me through the day without getting nearer to edge. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To understand how I feel, I need to explain it a bit and I apologize in advance if it's to long.

Roughly 1.5 - 2 years ago I was studying at an private university. Part of this was to work in a company, which paid the fees for the uni. My workplace was roughly 100km (62 miles) away with a car. Due to my lack of money I didn't have a car and had to travel with public transportation. One trip took nearly two hours of time, so basicly when I worked I left at 4am and came back at 8 to 9pm. Not a good situation if one has to study.

So my parents and I decieded it would be best if I moved closer to my working place. Since my father wanted to move also and his flat was way nearer than mine I settled with his old flat. But now the tricky and bad part starts. Due to somekind of depression I didn't go to work and I didn't send in the stuff from the doc in time. After a short while they were fed up with me and canceld the contract which made me work for them.

I didn't tell my parents, because I just couldn't. Up until that year I was the one in the family who got everything without ever doing much. Neither in the negative nor in the postive way. But now I fucked up mayor. Well I couldn't hide it forever since the fees for the uni had to be paid. 

I still moved, since it was also closer to my uni and well all plans were made. After I moved I tried to find a new company to help me with my uni fees, but it didn't go well. My mother said I should stick with it, because I only had two semesters left after the one I was in.

But I never really got over the depression and now living on my own with no friends near me and my family even further away it only dragged me in deeper. I didn't really care about anything at one point, but online gaming with my gaming buddies. I still attended uni, but I didn't pay much attention and did not learn a bit. So I failed two exams in the first try and one a second time. For this uni it meant, that I failed and had to leave. I wasn't really sad about it, but neither was I happy. All went to shit.

This all happened in roughly 3 months after I moved. I continued to live there for the next 4 to 5 months. Not really trying to find a job or anything. I just didn't feel like it. In the end I had piled up a huge amount of debt and my parents stepped in. They said that I had to choose, either I would move to my mother and her husband or to my father and his girlfriend and her two daughters. I decided for the later.

That is now excatly one year ago on the day. I moved in and I had somekind of support now. Everything started to get better. In one month time I found a job and started to pay of my debts. My depression got down to a level I could easily deal with and I felt really good in general. But then it started to fall apart again. My father and his now ex girlfriend broke up, so it was clear that he and I need to move out at somepoint, but still I didn't really think it would be that bad. I fell in love and hurt myself in less than a month and to top things of just a week ago I got informed that I will be layed of at the end of March from my workplace.

My depression hit hard again. I don't see any point to even try to get my shit together. I promised my ex girlfriend that I would, but it's hard. I need to find a therapist and a new workplace, but it's just to hard. I called several therapist but not one of them takes new clients and so I'm left with calling and hoping for the best. I don't really think I should try to find a new job before I find a therapist, because I don't think I could convince anybody to hire me. I'm a wreck and it's easy to see.

I just think I need somebody, who will help me with it. Somebody who helps me to carry burden. Somebody who reminds me that there are things worth fighting for. But I can't tell my father and neither anybody else of my friends or family. Not that they would not support me, but I just can't tell them.

In my current state I will not see another year. In my current state everyday is a struggle to not end it right away and with everyday passing without a glimmer of hope I'll be at the point where I loose the fight sooner than later. I just needed to tell someone and if you truly read all of it thank you, you just have seen the tip of the iceberg passing by. </TEXT>

But for the first time in I think nearly ten years I'm searching for professional help to get me out of this shit. For the longest time I thought I could do it alone and at least get on a level of eating that was healthier, but now I'm seeing that I will always relapse if I don't get help.

Thanks for you words, even if I can't use your "technique" for me, it still shows me, that it's possible :) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hej there,

I'm a 23 year old "man" from a more rural area now moving to Mnchengladbach. I'm looking for a female in the are I'm able to bond with. My hobbies are pretty slim and currently include reading, programming, listening to music, surfing, chatting and gaming for the most part, but I'm open to test out new things. The music I listen to is for the most part Rock, Metal and Punk, but if I like something I hear it no matter what genre.

The person I'm looking for should be roughly in my age, but that does not mean I don't want to hear from older or younger people, it's just easier with people in roughly the same age. Also it would be the best if you would live somewhere nearish and easy reachable with public transport.

The reason I'm looking for a female friend is, that my past my male friends weren't as good friends as the females and somehow I feel like it's easier for me to connect and bond with females than males. Well that concludes all I had in my mind. You can ask questions if you want to know more, because I'm really bad at stuff like this. </TEXT>

The really bad thing is, that I sometimes even do part of the action necessary to kill myself, before I even realize it. Several times I was walking in a fashion that would have put me infront of a train or a fast car. One time I was nothing but a few seconds short of climbing over a handrail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly don't know which would be better. Cutting her from my life will hurt like hell, but keeping her in it also. For once I settled with keeping her in, but I told her that this may change if my pain grows to big.

The thing is I don't really have anyone I can share my pain with. I'm normally not a person to share feelings with his friends or family. However there are a few who know a bit, but I don't think they see how badly this hurts me. I mean we have just been together a few weeks, but I fell really fast for her and I love her. It's more than one would assume is there after that short period of time.

It may sound pathetic but I think now with 23, nearly 24, I had my first big love. I loved before but it was never so intense like this, but how can I tell that to anybody without looking like a foolish teenager?

I thank you for your words, tips and time. It may read like I don't appreciate them, but I truly do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not illegal at all in Germany, but the holder of the copyrights to it, the state of Bavaria, doesn't give out any allowance to print new copies. Old copies however can be sold if they are single e.g. yard sale.
It should be noted, that the Copyright for the book only goes until 31.12.2015, but it can be safely assumed that there will be other things the German and Bavarian state does to prevent the unedited printing and selling of the book at least in Germany.

The state of Bavaria gives permission to print special copies for educational purposes. I never had any of them in my hands, but I assume they are commented and edited. The printing and selling of an unedited version of "Mein Kampf" is beside the copyright infringement also an infringement of  86, 86a and 130. The first two say that you are not allowed to spread or use symbols or propaganda of institutions who are against the German constitution. The last one forbids hate speech. 

If you are able to speak German head [here](http://www.damaschke.de/notizen/index.php/zur-rechtslage-von-mein-kampf/), it's the answer of the state of Bavaria in regards of the legal state of the Book "Mein Kampf". </TEXT>

We have a law that forbids the usage of the symbols of forbidden institutions, except for educational or artistic and some other usages. E.g. we have groups in Germany that use a crossed out Swastika as a symbol against Nazis and racism. Because of the cross out it's clear that you are not affiliating with the Nazis and thus it's okay.

Another example is if you grandma was in the Bund deutscher Mdels (girlscouts of the Third Reich) and has a certificate about it, it's okay if you hang it somewhere in your house.

But yeah in general it's better not to have any symbols of it and you are good to go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your kind words. The thing is I never wanted to burden her with it. I told her because I thought she would want to know.

As I said in another reply she said that the chances of us getting back together are not very high. I fear that when I keep myself near her, that it will drag me down even further. I'm pretty clueless what to do right now.

Also getting into therapy takes a long while. And I'm looking for a therapist not to far away, but until I'm not a burden to myself anymore a long time will pass and I don't know if I'm able to handle it.

I'm glad it worked out for you and your SO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Believe me I think about it all the time. I told her that I wanted to change and I meant it. However she made it very clear that there is no real hope for us.

She said she would be glad if we could be friends at s some point because she finds me co congenial.

Thanks for your words anyway. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> She left me and I understand her, still it hurts.... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> She left me, because she felt like I was putting all my problems on her shoulders, but all I wanted was, that she knew about them, because they are a huge part of me. But it looks like I only managed to push her away and destroy her feelings for me. And now I hate mysel even more.

Granted it was not long what we were together, we only met roughly a month ago, but I fell for her fast and hard. I loved her, heck I still do, but I managed to destroy what she felt for me. She ended it today and since it ended I was always on the edge.

I cried so much, because I hoped that even through we had problems last weekend we would still be able to manage it, to get it together, but no. I destroyed all of it. She still likes me as a friend, but I don't think I can do that. In the two hours we talked today all I wanted to do, was to hold her in my arms and kiss her. I wanted to feel her warmth and I wanted to feel her love for me in the kisses, but nothing like that happens.

I can't really tell anybody, how should I explain people that I fell so freaking hard, that I believed I could share everything with her? I never felt like that before. I don't have anybody I feel like I could share everything with.

Maybe my dad and my friends are right. I'm still young and sooner or later I may meet someone again, but right now all I want is her. I just want to be with her, but not as a friend, but as a lover, as her SO, but we will not be getting back together. She said that she doesn't think her feelings will come back.

I don't know how I should deal with that. I'm on the edge, I always were. I don't feel like drinking or eating. I don't feel like anything, beside sitting there and crying, but I ran out of tears.

I just hate myself for what I am, for the pathetic human being I turned out to be. I wish I could turn the time back, before the dreadful weekend and prevent all that shit, but I know that it's not possible.

So I'll just try and get into state where I can live for a bit and maybe one day I'll wake up and don't feel the emptiness she left inside of me. Maybe one day I'll remember the good things and be glad that she showed me, that there may be people out there where I can be myself, where I don't need to protect myself.

I don't know, but right now I just want to get off my chest that I love her and that I would take her back without hesitation. That I would do everything I can to see her right now. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My self doubt is back, and it's really strong. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sorry for the long post and maybe it's a bit confusing, but thanks for reading. Also any help is welcome, even through I don't think it's necessary.

I'm in fear for myself currently. After some horrible relationships I found someone I can really love again. I fell fast for her and we didn't take things slowly. I said the big L word the 3rd time we slept together. It was after we had sex the first time together. It would've happened earlier, but I'm not good with my penis, because I normally don't last very long, but I know that other parts of my body can be amazing, so I somehow avoided the whole sex thing for a while, but she wanted it and it happened.

It was bad. I didn't feel good, because I wanted to last longer, I wanted it so bad that I couldn't enjoy it at all. But afterwards she told me that she didn't expect it to be good and that it's okay that I don't last, as long as I enjoy it she will enjoy it.

That night as we lay cuddled together both nearly asleep I said it. I said "I love you". It was nothing I really thought about it was my subconscious who said it, I couldn't really remember in the morning. She heard it also, but was not sure if the dreamed it or if it truly happened, so neither of us mentioned it.

Later that day we were cuddling in the bed again, I wanted to say it, but I'm a pussy when I have to tell the people I feel something for how I feel. When it was finally out she said that she dreamed that I said it to her the night before and we both came to the conclusion that I said it then the first time, which was way better than the second time. However she didn't answer to it right away. She kept it for herself till the next morning when I was leaving. She took me aside for a second and leaned really really close to my ear with her mouth. I could feel her warm breath and how her hair was touching my, that alone gave me goosebumps, but then she said it. My knees nearly folded underneath me, it felt so awesome to hear it from her.

That however is now 2 weeks in the past. The last time we've seen each other I was being something of a dick. My brain was occupied with this stupid self doubt I often have and which I thought I was able to at least silence for a while. She was angry at me, but we talked about it and I told her about it, so it was all good, at least I thought so. The doubt left me alone till the next day, when I was not with her anymore. We played a game together, which she knows better than me. She rushed through it and I was taking things slower. She asked me what was wrong and why I took so long. I didn't tell her, because I feared that when she knew this stuff was new to me, she would resent me. I left the game and said to her, that I'm okay when she completes it without me.

The next morning on my way to work we are writing and are talking about what happened in the game. I tell her that I was to pride to tell her to slow down, which is kind of true, but she sees right trough it and calls me out on my lie. She says that I'm afraid. She says that I'm afraid of loosing her, because of the stupidest reasons. She is right and she hates that I lied to her with my pride. She gets angry and I can understand it.

The thing I though was done from the Sunday (the day I was a dick) comes up again and she says that she needs time for herself. I want to give it to her. She says that we can't see each other on Friday or Saturday, because she has to work. Before this shit happened she had a free weekend. Not anymore. I'm really sad because we wouldn't be able to see each other till the 2nd Feb.

I try to find ways how we can see each other on the weekend. The dismisses nearly all of them except, that I can come visit her on Sunday. She also told me that she may have to think about our relationship. She wants to talk with me before this. This happened on Tuesday.

Since then my self doubts started escalating. I couldn't really sleep. I even left work early on Wednesday, because I barely slept an hour. I was feeling sick and I was on the edge of crying and breaking down all the time.

Yesterday and today was better, mostly because I took sleeping pills to be able to get rest in the night. For the day I'm on some antidepressants I got a few years back. They help me to cope with the situation. But still my brain sometimes decides to say me that the worst will happen and then I start thinking what I'll do then.

I started to think about harming myself again. Something I didn't do for the last 5-6 years. Even in my shittiest time I never thought about harming myself. Not killing myself, just getting myself injured so much that I'm in a hospital, maybe even something potential life threatening.

My brain just won't shut up about all the failures in my life, about all the mistakes I made, about how bad I am at many things, even things that are not in my control. It shows me a picture of my SO smiling and being happy and then it tells me she's not with me, that's why she is feeling so good.

Not even a week after my self doubt was gone, it's back and it's worse than ever. I just hope I can hide it good enough from her, so that I don't appear needy. I just hope and wish, that she will give me, us, a chance so that I can proof to her, that I can cope with my shit. But on the other hand I fear it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sick of you. Stop creeping up on me in my sleep and turning my dreams into nightmares of failure. Stop making me think about how it will be when my current relationship ends or even worse think about all the horrible ways it could end. Stop making me believe that I'll never be enough for her, stop making me think that the stuff I told her about my past is pushing her away and that she secretly started to resent me. Nothing like this is happening. Nothing she is doing even slightly indicates it.

I hate you. You ruined so much in the past, but not this time. I will not give in and let you rule me. See this beautiful, smart and sweet girl? Yeah she is with me and she is stomping you in the ground. She is boosting my self more than anything ever.

I know I fostered you for years and I loved to hear you out, but not anymore. Our time is over and you have to leave. It won't be easy but I will make it and in the end I will never ever need you again.

So go fuck yourself and leave me alone! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As the title states I'm thinking about starting to play e-bass. I had this idea several times over the last 5-10 years but never really the money or the time to do so. The money is now better, the time not so, but I'm willing to reduce my time on other things to be able to practice.

Are there any tips you can give me? What do you think about books or dvds to learn it or should I go look for a tutor? I found several starter sets online, are they good enough or should I better go and buy everything seperate?

Also if you have general tips on how to approach it, please share them.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I met this girl through an online dating platform. We texted a lot (nearly 1200 message in 10 days) and on saturday we met for the first time. It was great. She is fun, beautiful, smart, sweet heck she is everything I'm into.

I realized that I liked her at that day. My best friend, who I met afterwars asked me the right question, a question I have been thinking about since then. He asked me if she was the right person for a relationship. Back then I couldn't say neither yes nor no, because I didn't know.

We made plans for a little 'party' on silvester, it was only the two of us at her place. Sure her parents were on the other floor, but we had her room for us and each other. Again it was great. At first I was a bit, well kind of shy, because in the three days I realized that I like her much, but I didn't want the things to happen to fast.

Needles to say we kissed and made out and we are now saying, that we are together. But still I have the feeling we are falling to fast, that we should've taken it slower, but then again I don't want it to be slower. I want to be with her, I want to hold her in my arms. I want to hear her voice, I want to see her face, her smile, her everything.

I say that I like her a lot neither of us used the big L and I don't want it to be used to early, because it can be harmful to early, but nontheless I think I've fallen in love with her. It's more than likeing. The thing is I never got so strong feelings for any of my SOs before. Sure I liked them but never in this way so fast.

We didn't have sex, even through it was pretty close, and I'm glad about it. We were at the point where we both were naked, but then something broke the mood and we couldn't do it. Still we lay naked in her bed cuddling and hugging. That is very rare for me. It's not that I hate being naked, but I hate the way my body looks. I always try to hide all the things I don't like about it, but with her I didn't feel the need to, I just wanted to feel her skin on my skin. Heck I even wanted her to see it all.

I think we are falling to fast and I fear that it may be over again as fast as it began, but I don't want to miss a thing. I don't really know what I want, but I know I want to be with her.

Sorry the text is a bit longer than intended. If you read it all thanks for that :) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just don't like my job. I just started in March and back then everything seemed fine. It all looked like a smallish company where the co workers are pretty close and the atmosphere is pretty easy. So when they said they wanted me, despite my lack of a college degree, I took it.

But now I only keep the job for the money I need to pay back debts I have and to pay for a living. I'm not energetic as I was before when I got to work and some days I even wish something would happen on my way there, so that I won't have to work.

It's not like I hate the job in general. I still love doing the tasks and facing the challenges, it's just that the atmosphere is not like I thought it would be. I can't see myself working here for the rest of my life. Heck I can't see myself working here for the next 3 years, because I don't want to. But I'm to afraid to quit it, mainly because of financial reasons, but also because I don't want to disappoint my father, my mother and all the other people counting on me.

I'm not even sure anymore, if I really want to do this for a living or want it go back to what it was before a hobby. I love programming and I would love to do it again at home, but since I work fulltime as a programmer I didn't write one line of code at home. I just can't. If I see code when I'm at home I get annoyed.

I don't know what I want to do for a living beside this. I don't have a high degree only a minor in IT stuff and I want to stay in the IT field, but most companies look for people who studied it and I tried it, but I don't like to study. I'm not a person to study.

Also I don't want to stay in Germany forever. I want to leave it, maybe go in the UK or Sweden or Canada I don't really know. I don't think I could make it there alone. I'm not a person to go out very often so I would be completely alone there and that's something I don't want to.

So after all I don't know anything about where I want to got with my life. I just know, that I don't want to keep this job for any day longer than I need. And if you read it till the end I thank you kind stranger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello /r/Poetry,

before you read my poem I would like to say a few things. First of all I'm not a native speaker so it's pretty presumable that I have errors in it, be them spelling mistakes or grammar errors, however I don't want you to be easy on me because of that, I want you to judge and point these errors out.
Seconldy based on the errors that may be in it I can understand if you don't understand right away what I tried to say, so it's okay for you to ask I even ask you to ask.
Last of it I hope you enjoy it and I hope I get few tips and hints. Now I don't want to take more time here's my first little poem.

    We should learn from the past but still we often do the same error twice
    I wish I talked to you back then, but even though I know I should do it now
    I still cant wrap my head around how you would react if I told you everything
    Would you be ashamed of me? Would you be angry for not telling you earlier?
    I know I gave you hints about it all, but I dont think you really can grasp the whole
    Maybe these hints are like little signs calling for attention, begging you to dig
    I dont know if you realized it or if you are to sensible to dig
    Somehow I hope someone would come and help me with the situation
    cause Im lost and I feel alone, the dark is closing and the light is fading
    I just live to take away the burdens I created in the end I want to die to lift the last burden I am
    Either way this whole thing called my life goes, I just want you to know
    I love you and will always do.

	<TEXT> You were there in the club and I've seen you right from the beginning. Your beauty was taunting me, daring me to talk to you, but I couldn't I was to afraid. I just stood there at the bar and looked at you and your friends. Seeing the fun you had on the dance floor.

Then out of seemingly nowhere you were beside me and smiling at me. You asked me if I would buy you a drink. How could I've said no? I was lost in your eyes the moment they were close to me. I don't remember much about how you looked, but your eyes and you smile haunt me ever since.

We talked we had fun and you went with your friend, because she wanted to smoke and said you'll be right back. After a short while I got nervous for me it felt like an eternity and at some point I left. I don't know why and I could punch myself for it.

I don't have any way to contact you and you no way of contacting me. But I want to find you and see you again and talk to you again. You are beautiful and smart, but the possibility to find you again is nearly zero. Stupid drunken me.

Beside that I want to thank you, you made my night, which was going to suck, but you made it worth it. You showed me,that I may be wrong with my non existent self esteem and for that I say thanks. Even trough we may never meet again I will remember you for a long time and after a while I may stop hating me for what I did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there,

my name is Dennis and I'm from the greater area around Dsseldorf in North-Rhine Westphalia in Germany. I moved here roughly 9 months ago and was busy getting used to my job and stuff like that. But now I want to get to know people in this area, so that I may get out on weekends.
I actually live an hour away from Dsseldorf, but since I work here I spend 5 days a week in the city directly and I have a public transport ticket to get here.

I'm a pretty nerdy and geeky guy. I work 40hrs a week as a C# developer. My hobbies are mainly chatting with friends, surfing the web, reading about stuff and gaming, but I also like to go partying or just spend quality time with people I like. Besides that I'm pretty interested in body modification, even through I myself only have 2 tattoos, from whom one is still WIP as of yet.

Well I don't really know what to write, so feel free to ask here or message me and we can get into contact. I'm more interested in people around this area, but if you think we could like each other then message me I love knowing people from many different places. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay this story now goes back for something over 2 years and partly even 2.5 years. There are two pars in this. Part one is directed towards my ex girlfriend. Part two is more directed towards myself I think.

**Part 1**


It started around March or April 2011 where I met you the first time. You were introduced to me by a friend of mine on a party. I didn't really think much of you, you seemed to me just as many others I knew. You even were interested in my then best friend, so I didn't care.  

The time flew by and more often then not you were doing stuff with us and I got to know you better. I even let you sleep in my place, since you lived a good amount of time away and why not? I can't pinpoint a date but at some point in fell in love with you. I don't know what I found in you but it happened and you said you also fell in love with the me.  

After a short period of time, we started a relationship. It was not a good relationship and most of my closer friends warned me, but I was naive and didn't care. Hard to believe I was 21 and still naive about this stuff. We fought often and you always blamed me for everything. You blamed my depression and my ED.  
We were together for roughly 3 to 4 months, then one night you broke it without any hint beforehand. I was staying at a friend and you called me and told me that it was over. I was devastated. I cried that night and talked a lot with my friend. I stayed in his house for another 2 days, before I returned home, where so much reminded me of you.  

I was sorting stuff out, trying to get your smell out of my bed, my clothes and everything. Then you called. You were crying asking me to take you back. Saying it was your biggest error to cut me off. Even your mother asked me to do so. You two pressured me into taking you back and the next day you stood before my door.  
But I couldn't get into the relationship again. It didn't feel right, so I said to you that it didn't work out anymore, that I don't think we should be together.  

You snapped and insulted me and threw every shit you had against me. You even told me about how you fucked two of my closest friends that weekend, knowing that my friendship with one of them was corrupted by lies he told me. He was my best friend for over 15 years at that point and you made me break contact with him. I'm not angry about you telling it me, I never was. I was angry about you doing stuff like that just a day after you broke off with me. I broke contact with my best friend and for over a year I did not exchange a word with him.

I told everyone how I was doing fine. I even lied to my friends about girls I met and dates I went to. I lied about my depression and ED saying that I'm on a way up.  
I was not. I was in a downward spiral. I lost my job and threw my education, because I just couldn't stand it. Even now nearly two years afterwards I still suffer.  

You destroyed my life and now suddenly everything is fine and you think about contacting me? You are surprised, that I don't want to talk to you? You really think you were not at fault? Sorry but no. You have destroyed to much in me. So please go fuck yourself.

**Part 2**

It's plainly easy I hate myself. I hate that let people destroy my self-esteem. I hate that I over think stuff. I hate that I try always to be in control even through I know I can't control everything. I hate the way I look. I hate the way my body is shaped. I hate my depression. I hate my ED. I hate to think about my own demise. I hate how I can't motivate myself enough to do something about it. This is depressing me.

There are only two things I don't hate about myself. I like my eyes, this green with a freckle of brown in it. I just love it. My addiction to tattoos, even through I'm just at the beginning of what I plan for my body.

If I would have to describe myself I would say: A ball of self hatred. And I hate it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't want you to blame yourself, because I don't blame you. You two did everything to hide the bad things from us and tried to make it as easiest for all of us.
Still the feeling of being left alone by you, Dad, was there. We never build a really good relationship. It's not bad don't get me wrong, but I needed a male I could look up to in my life. Even through mom married again after a few years, he could not and I didn't want him to fill the gap you left. Now over 15 years later we are living together, but now it's late. Yes, you are my dad and yes I love that's why I say you are not blame on how I turned out, on all the bad decisions I made and make, on all the mistakes I knowingly choose to do.


I lived with you for nearly 13 years and still you often where not there when I needed you, mum. I never told you that I need you there, I always said I was fine even through I wasn't. You had to work to keep up the life my sister and I were living and I know you wanted to be there for us. I've put you through a lot of shit and even through you never said it in while I could hear it, I know you blame yourself for not being there and helping me with my struggles, but you are not to blame. It was me, who attacked the teacher, it was me who nearly got thrown out of school because I couldn't control my anger. It's not your fault, it never was. It was mine alone.


You two always tried to make sure I'll become a decent human being and besides all my flaws and problems I think that you succeeded. All my hate and ager is directed towards myself. I love you and always will.


You are my sister and I love you. We often fought and had our problems which each other, but which pair of siblings does that not?
I always looked up to you. In my thoughts you are my cool bigger sister. I always wanted to protect you, even though I'm younger. Remember the one time I threated your boyfriend of that time to break his legs if he hurts you in any way? He was like 2 meters height and 2 years my older, but still I threated him and he knew I was being serious.


I love you Sis and your kid. I hope she becomes a good woman and makes you proud. I know I put you also through some rough times even through you never said it or hinted it at me. I've gone through a few rough times because you had them.


To all my friends, who stood and still stand by me. I thank you from my heart. I know I'm not a easy person to get along, but you somehow manged it. Without you I would've had many more times in which I would've tried to end it. You often picked me up when I was down. Made me smile besides all the pain I felt. I'm grateful to know you. You'll all be always in my heart. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Helping to catch a drugger </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Firstly: I do not work in security but I thought you guys and gals might be interested in this story since it involves security.

Background: It all happened in a medium sized rock/metal/goth club. The guards where not always on the different floors but would patrol the area. Besides this occasion I've never seen the guards in action and I went there pretty often.

The club was pretty full and everybody was having fun. I was standing on the side of the moshpit, when a girl caught my eye. She was standing with her back to, what I assumed was her drink. She didn't caught my eye because she was such a beauty but more because there was this guy looming behind her, trying to be all sneaky and stuff. It was weird but I had seen weirder people in this club so first I didn't really think about it, but then he made a movement with his arm above her glass. First I really didn't think about what I had just witnessed but when she grabbed for her drink it dawned to me, that the guy, who was still near but backed up a bit, had put somekind of drug into the drink.
As fast as the press of the bodies lets me I get to her and say into her ear, that I saw a guy dropping something in her drink. Together we get to the bar with the drink and tell the bartender what I've seen. Not much later three guards approaches us and take us to a less crowded and load area, where I tell them what I've seen and try to describe the guy. Sadly he wasn't really outstanding by any means, but I was sure that I could recognize him.
So the guards take me with them to find the guy, as we scan through the different floors I spot him and again he was trying to put something in someones glass. He was like 20m away. I tell the guards and one of them charges him and takes him down from behind. Both land on the ground and the drugger lands face first on the concrete getting a bloody nose and maybe loosing a few teeth. They are really rough with him and escort him to the office. In the meantime the management had called the cops so they were waiting there also.
I have to tell my story again and get a "today you drink for free"-card from the management, get a nice pad on the back from security and even the first girl thanks me with her number.
Moral of the story: Alway report strange things I may pay for you.

P.S. I did not see what or if he dropped something, but he made an odd movement above the glass so I wanted to play it safe. Later they found roofies and other drugs on him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I met her on the birthday party of my stepsister in June and we talked a lot that evening/night.
After that we first wrote via FB but soon exchanged mobile numbers and began also to text via WhatsApp. Since the party I have met her a few times in the bus, 'cause on my way to work I drive with the school bus. We talked a bit, mostly just small talk.
I hinted a few times, that I would like to meet her without anybody else we would need to care about around. So no stepsister, no friends, a date I would say. She agreed in general, but we never made an actual plan.
Two month ago she then asked my stepsister to invite me to a little come together near a little lake. Again we talked and had a good time.
Then our texting got a bit slower (instead of a few messages a day, one every few days). Two weeks ago she invited me to a little come together, the problem for me was, that I had to work a long time that  day and I have a "long" way home (about 1.5hrs). Still I said that I would come.
Then I chickened out because I would've not known anyone besides her and I don't like to cling to somebody when there are friends around of that person. So I said her, that I didn't find the place where the meet up should happen, I'm "new" to the town and I don't go out much, and went home.
Afterwards she asked me why I didn't ask somebody where it was and that was the last time we had contact. I still want to meet her and getting to know her more. How should I do that? I've no idea what to say/write. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suffer from depression, anorexia and a few other minor mental disorders and problems.
I don't think suffer is quite the right word but I'll go with it. As long as I remember I have to cope with them. A few times in the past I thought I had hit the rock bottom which resulted in suicide attempts. But now I think the deepest I ever got into it was last year. I lost my scholarship, I still could study but since it was very expensive and my parents paid for it I really didn't want to anymore. I didn't learn or anything got thrown out because I didn't make it.

Afterwards I was really down for letting all this shit happen, after all it was all my fault and I knew it. I didn't eat for days (sometimes a whole week), I just buried my self in my flat and did nothing. I arranged a huge pile of debt and even got charged for fraud. Since I couldn't afford the flat anymore I had to move to my dad, after that it was getting better.

I'm paying my debts and starting to get a hold of my life at least in the financial aspect. Everything else is as it was before. I still don't feel like doing anything and if not for the debts I wouldn't even go to work, even through I really enjoy it.
If someone asks me how I am, I always say everything is fine and I'm getting hold of all the shit, which is not true. It's not as bad as last year but still I'm just eating when I know it would raise suspicions if I wouldn't.

I really hate myself for letting the opportunity go and now don't have an degree or anything. I just needed one freaking year more, but I had to follow my impulses and didn't hear what my mind had to say. It wouldn't be as bad if it were the first time it fucked me up, but basically most of the times I really fucked up were when my mind lost control over myself.

I'm not sure why I am writing this, but thanks anyway for reading. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My life with anorexia and depression so far </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-07 11:21:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, I'm not really sure where to start. It's quite a lot and hard for me to put into sentences, even more so, since English is not my prime language, so please forgive me if I make a few errors.
Well I think a good start would be telling you guys what I'm fighting with and then I'll tell you most of my story which led me to this post. I'm 23 and fighting with depression and anorexia nervosa, at least for 16 to 17 years now.
If I had to pin a point in my life where this mess really started I would say it was the divorce of my parents at age 6/7. They didn't fight in front of me or my sister, but still something was a miss and I could feel it. Instead of talking to my parents or anybody I got quite and kept all the shit to myself. This led to several problems in school, where I was pushed over the edge of shit I could take. If that happened I would get angry and violent.
I was 'sent' to a child therapist because my outbreaks were becoming more and more of an issue and finally led to me harming a good friend of mine. The therapy was 'successfully', meaning that I didn't hurt other people anymore. Instead I directed the anger and frustration against myself.
When we got an internet connection at home I soon was fond of it. I got into several MMOs and did not much more besides playing online and going to school. Gaming is still a big point in my life.
Well as life goes I fell in love and it didn't work out and how it is as a teenager you exaggerate stuff like that, which led to my fist suicide attempt. After that I had two more attempts with different methods.
Nobody in my family or of my friends noticed them and I hid (and still hide) the attempts, so that they may never know. I feel ashamed of them now.
I quietly lived my life with my anorexia and hid it more or less successfully. I don't know if my mother or my sister really didn't notice but nonetheless I hid it. I am and never was a big eater but often I wouldn't eat at all. I would give away my lunch so that my mother didn't notice that I haven't eaten in school.
Then round-a-bout 2 to 3 year ago I got a big collapse. I somehow managed to live with my depression and anorexia, which as far as I know is part of my depression, but then my then girlfriend stepped in my life and threw the stuff over. It wasn't a good relationship we often argued over little things and more then once she threaded me with breaking up. After we finally broke up, she said to me, that she had an affair with my best friend nearly all the time and what a looser I am.
After that I wasn't really able to get hold of myself. I didn't know whom to trust and saw betrayers everywhere. This led to really bad eating habits. Sometimes I didn't eat for nearly 4-5 days in a row. Which led to problems with my health. In total I was 4 times in the hospital because my circulation just crashed. I didn't sent my medical certificates to work and so I was thrown out. Since the work financed my study I had to ask my parents to pay for it, which was really hard for me since they don't have much money either. I didn't finish studying because I failed a subject.
And after all this wall of text we are in the present. I now live with my dad and have a job again. I'm not at the bottom currently, but I'm still struggling to eat properly and I'm constantly afraid of hitting the rock bottom for whatever reason again. It's very hard for me to seek help, be it from friend/family or professional and it took a lot for me to type these words. I'm not even sure what I want to achieve with this text, but I had the need to at least tell somebody. </TEXT>
