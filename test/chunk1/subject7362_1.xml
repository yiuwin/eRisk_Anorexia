	<TEXT>  helium rain

"rain" implies one fluid condensing into droplets within another fluid and then falling through that second fluid due to differences in density. on earth water condenses in the air and then falls down because it is heavier. i would suggest that in this diagram the "helium rain" layer is actually the just bottom of the liquid hydrogen layer where helium tends to condense and fall down. remember that on earth water really only condenses at (in other words clouds only form at) the very bottom of the atmosphere, usually not above 10km. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "optimal" is subjective, or, at the very least, contingent upon the actual results of the taken action. say for instance i renounce my citizenship and leave my federation world and end up on a idyllic, peaceful agrarian world, populated by buxom liberal women and am regarded as a deity that came from the sky - is that really sub-optimal?

I think you are making an argument from a nihilist's point of view, that oblivion is preferable to existance. You can't seriously claim this is an objectively superior argument because it is predicated on an axiomatic framework that not everyone believes in.

Edit: And furthermore, many people, especially those in a liberal society such as the federation, would believe that having "no choices", as you put it, is synonymous with suffering. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> presumably you could renounce your federation citizenship and either 1) continue to live in federation territory 2) leave and live in some other territory, perhaps eventually acquiring a new citizenship 3) live on some non-aligned or uninhabited planet since there seem to be so many out there, or 4) live on a vessel in deep space. even if your planet's application to the federation is accepted through the democratic process there are still many options for an individual who does not want to be part of the federation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> just learned about this last week. with dogberries the amount of fruit on the trees is dependent on the weather from the previous summer. for instance, if the dogberries are scarce in 2016 (as they are) it means there must've been a bad summer in 2015 (as there was, in record breaking fashion). apparently the buds the berries form on grew the previous year - if the weather was bad those buds don't form and the berries are scarce the next year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just gotta say this is beautifully shot/cropped. We get almost no context to tell us why this absurd ballet is happening. We are teased with hints of an origin of or a destination for the traffic, a hint of some sort of plan, yet it all remains just outside the frame or just beyond our reach. If I knew more it wouldn't be nearly as compelling. As it is it's so satisfyingly frustrating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> and maggie needs the doctor at hilltop, which is in savior territory. and they'd have to abandon the old folks and youngins at alexandria (and probably many of the adults as well) because they'd be unable to coordinate a move with so many useless people. and also, they don't know which direction leads deeper into savior territory, and which leads out. and they're probably already completely surrounded by saviors or those who are loyal to them anyways. running away is not easy at all when you think about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in a rural area of a low-population, isolated island. Though I'm not terribly strong I'm healthy and fit and have very good tolerance for hardship. I garden and I have quite a lot of experience with foraging. I know how to fish and there are rich freshwater and marine fishing grounds very nearby. I've never hunted but I know my way around a gun and I know where to easily get several - also, there is an abundance of large game in my area. I can build just about anything and have some electrical and mechanical skills. There is abundant firewood and freshwater just outside my door. We have winter here for five months of the year, so no zombies to worry about from November - March. In most normal survival situations I'm set.
However, in the zombie apocalypse of The Walking Dead the most useful traits don't seem to be those we normally associate with survival. Survivors seem to be people who are extremely hostile towards strangers and wary of unknown situations, or those who are outright willing to rob/kill/dominate others without conscience. Outgoing and idealistic people are finished as soon as they encounter even a single person who is willing use them. That'd be me: I'd do great until one bad person came along, I'd be dead, and I never would have seen it coming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me as a cyclist this is one of the worst things a driver can do. They disrupt normal traffic flow and flout the rules and think they are showing me some kind of "courtesy". What they're really doing is showing me they don't know how to drive and that they expect me to put my body and bicycle in front of their vehicle. Not a chance. When it happens, and when it's safe to do so, I plant both my feet on the ground and cross my arms over my chest until they move along. If i think they'll hear me I'll also shout out why I'm doing what I'm doing, like "I have a stop sign," or "You have the right-of-way." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it was a conceit of the franchise that the Federation, and Earth in particular, are exceptional (in the vein of "American Exceptionalism"). In the Star Trek universe humans are not the strongest, not the smartest, not the most advanced, but there is just something special and unique about them that enables them to wield power over a huge swath of the galaxy. The Borg recognize that and presumably feel they need to conduct a wholesale assimilation of Earth in order to assimilate that quality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is an unrealistically low number of loose ends in this series. The world has descended into utter chaos and destruction and the characters (and viewers) basically know the fate of everyone they've encountered. It seems likely that in such a world many characters would wander off and never been seen again. It's happened a few times, like with Morales, but it's been undone more times than not, like when Morgan and Merle and Beth miraculously reappear or are found. I think it would be a great source of dramatic tension if a significant character simply disappeared, leaving the group in confusion rather than mourning. But mass audiences seem to want unrealistic closure more so than dramatic tension, so that's what we end up with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watched the movies before I read the books, in fact before I knew anything at all about the franchise. From this cold viewing the movies left me utterly baffled - I was unable to retain character names and identities, to tell the different races apart from each other, etc. I'd say read the books first, then watch the movies as a brilliant illustration of the books. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is as good a concise and witty answer as any other I've seen. More accurately, "craft" is a word some artists started using for their specific disciplines in the 19th century. Before that time use of the word "craft" to describe ceramics, textiles, woodworking, etc. would have been quite uncommon. These artists started handmaking pottery, clothing, and furniture as a protest against the inhumanity of the industrial revolution because these were among the earliest handmaking traditions to be subsumed by industrial processes. It was early political art. They needed a word for their general mission and chose "craft" because at the time it had cognitive overtones (which persist to this day, for example in "witchcraft" and "crafty"), and even political overtones (one scholar cites a late 18th century political magazine called "The Craftsman" which had nothing to do with making things).
So it's not so much that there is a difference between art and craft, just that craft was a field of early modern political art that coalesced in response to horrifying conditions in early industrial culture. The most interesting corollary to this, imho, is that craft didn't exist until 200 years ago. Of course pottery and textiles existed before then, but craft as a category and philosophical discipline sprang into existence as we know it because of some truly profound and passionate work by a community of makers and thinkers.

	<TEXT> I feel like season 7 is going to have a complete change of tone. it's going to be less about day to day survival (finding food and shelter, dealing with walkers and marauders) and more political (negotiating equilibrium among all the different tribes, whether through war or cooperation or trade). I think it's about time that some more permanent communities formed and I'm curious to see how all of them interact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm betting we won't even find out who was killed until the very end of the first episode of S7. We won't be shown right away, rather the episode will be structured so that the revelation will be the climax at the end. What will the episode be about? I'm guessing lots of flashbacks, maybe told from a really tight perspective revolving around Rick, where we see his turmoil and reactions but not a lot of plot detail until the very end. </TEXT>
