	<TEXT> A nice proof I have seen on the Physics forum insights is the following:
define x = 0.999
then 10x = 9.999
Note that since x has an infinite number of nines, making one a whole number by multiplying by ten does not change the number of nines after the decimal point. i.e  - 1 = .
Thus 10x and x have the same number of nines after the decimal point, so 10x - x  = 9x = 9
but if 9x = 9,
x = 1, but x = 0.999
thus:
1 = 0.999 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually there is a theorem, known as Noether's theorem that states that energy would not be conserved in that case. 
It is based on a principle in physics known as the principle of stationary action. The principle says that you have some function called the Lagrangian, and if you multiplied it by time, and summed all the little bits together, this sum would be the largest or smallest possible.

Noether's theorem says that if took the Lagrangian and changed some quantity in it, but that the Lagrangian itself did not change, there is some conserved quantity associated with this. For instance, because the laws of physics remain the same regardless of where you are, the Lagrangian does not change if you change location. Associated with this is the conservation of momentum.

The Lagrangian does not change with time, which is associated with the conservation of energy. Because energy is conserved, it means that the laws of physics do not change with time. Of course, this is all based on stationary action so if that principle were to change all this would be worthless  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Assuming that the train is massless, so that it must travel at light speed, onlookers would still see the coming beam move at light speed. 

What would happen from the train's perspective is not something that is known because to know what would happen from the train's perspective, you would need to be on the train, so that it appeared stationary to you. But you can't, because if an object travels at light speed it has to travel at light speed to you regardless of how fast you are moving. So you will never catch up with the train.

Also there is the fact that light does not experience the world like us. For humans, there is some spacial and temporal distance between any two events. For example, there is a spacial distance of 10 km, and a temporal distance of 1 hour between now and when some guy gets killed, let us say. 

Give or take a few constants and squares, you can combine these two distances to form a spacetime interval.  (The actual equation is the (speed of light squared times temporal distance squared) - spacial distance squared = spacetimedistance^2. The formula is a curved space version of Pythagoras theorem, hence the negative sign).
The spacetime interval is like regular distance in everyday life, except that you have a contribution from regular distance and a contribution from temporal distance. An object has some sort of speed quota, because everything must travel at the speed of light in spacetime. 

Some of this speed can be distributed to your speed in space, which is our regular speed, and some is directed to your temporal "speed". So if your speedometer shows zero, your speed through time is c, or 1 second per second. If you move in space, some of your speed is distributed to your speed in space, so your speed in time must decrease. This explains why time slows down when you move.

Light speed is simply when all of your spacetime speed is distributed to your speed in space. In other words, you are not moving through time. If you use the speed = distance *time equation and plug it in your spacetime distance equation, it shows you that the spacetime distance is zero for light. 

This is necessary, because if you move faster than light your spacetime distance changes sign and that means that you can go back in time and kill your father before you are born. Then you could fornicate with your mother to have her be pregnant with yourself so that you don't cease to exist, without even breaking your arms. But this creates a paradox because you must be born and before creating yourself, so this is impossible. This principle is called the law of causality. Light speed is this special speed where time does not change. This is why light speed is the highest speed an object can reach (if it is massless).

The whole point of this wall of text is to say: time and space don't look the same at light speed, we don't know what it looks like, so we do not know what we would see at light speed. Though we do know, that for observers on the platform,  even if you were travelling at light speed, the torch beam would also travel at light speed, regardless of how fast their velocity is if it is below the speed of light. 

As an aside, there is another reason as for why light travels at the speed of light. As mentioned below massive objects increase their mass exponentially as they move faster and faster and thus can't reach light speed. Massless objects, like light, can only have energy and momentum, which is basically what defines existence, if they are moving at light speed. Because of this energy, and E = mc^2, photons have mass if they travel at speed c and only then.

**Tl;dr: Light speed is the highest speed for an object because one must break his arms before materialising his Oedipus complex.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if I missed something, but does the article mean that the light slowed down in the medium, or it was much slower even beyond the medium? 
The article below suggests that the light was stopped in the medium. And I would think so too. 
Relativity says that massless objects must travel at the speed of light otherwise they have no energy. If that is the case, light cannot be slowed down. I remember reading something interesting (I think it was QED by Feynman, but I cannot confirm) some time ago that said that photons do not slow down in a medium, but instead are absorbed and reemitted and the delay between the two is what makes the light look slower.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess Dragon Ball Evolution? I did kind of enjoy it I admit, although it probably was entirely due to the hype of seeing that Dragon Ball got so popular that a movie was being made.  I get why it is hated so much: it is very, very far from Dragon Ball, and the story is pretty bland. But as someone whose heart rate spikes up at the mention of Dragon Ball, the movie was like LSD.
Even without the hype I still like the fact that the movie was made, because it was so bad that Toriyama wrote Battle of Gods, and that led to Super. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump goes into office, realises that all he has planned is flawed, gains divine enlightenment and becomes the best president in the world.
USA reaches a state of development never seen before and discovers a way of carrying out cold nuclear fusion. The cold fusion discovery throws all those greenhouse scientists into a scientific quest to discover a time machine: they go into the past and bring Bowie back to the future. Then they travel to the future and find a cure for cancer.
Meanwhile Modi's scheme is finally revealed. Kim Jong Un is offended, and takes to his guns. The two countries fight, and USA intervenes and kills both. Countries become safer, more democratic and free. Poverty is eliminated because of the freedom countries get from USA.
After seeing this, Putin gets jealous and Russia creates its own time machine. It travels to the past and gets Stalin back to the future. He reveals that Russia has always been the USSR. Soviet flashbacks for Russians, while Stalin is Stallin' for time to build weapons to fight the USA.

Meanwhile, a young apprentice god sees the brutality of the USSR and the impudent time travelling, and decided to time travel to his future self. He uses magical wishing balls to swap bodies with the strongest being in the universe and fuse with his future self. He returns to the past to just be sliced in two, cut in multiple pieces and then get blasted away by a young mysterious youth from the future. The youth reveals that he is the illegitimate son of Washington who had discovered time travel and travelled to the future but kept it a secret.
The young boy then joins the USA and strengthens their ranks. He destroys the USSR in one day. His hair turns purple, then blonde, then blue, then blonde, then blonde with a tinge of blue. As he looks upon the great country that his time-travelling father has built, he says:
"Father, you aren't Black, why did you abandon me?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> for the last one, while the operation remains undefined, there can be a way to find 0/0 in certain cases.
Suppose there are two functions f(x) and g(x), and that there is a real number c such that f(c) = 0, and that g(c) = 0, or that f(c) =  and that g(c) = .
If the functions are continuously differentiable, you could show that f(c)/g(c) = f'(c)/g'(c), where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to x. In that sense, you could have a value for 0/0. This is known as l'Hpital's rule. 
As an illustration, consider the functions (x^2 - 4)/(x - 2). When x = 2, the fraction becomes 0/0. If you differentiate them, however, you get 2x, which is 4 if x= 2. Thus (x^2 - 4)/(x -2) = 4.
Note that the value for 0/0 is still not defined, but it is rather the value for the ratio of the functions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okami and its sequel Okamiden. 
The first is for PS2 and the second for DS Lite. 
Really beautiful games in terms of looks. Both have this sort of Japanese watercolor styles to them.
Gameplay is also awesome. You can draw something with a magic brush at any time and wander over huge open fields.
And storywise, it is pretty appealing. The original is partially based on the story of Yamata-no-Orochi, a great snake from Japanese legends. You basically have to fight it, and do lots of other stuff along the way. Pretty long.
The sequel is the one I liked more though, main character is cute. And the story follows the son of the original protagonist, and how he meets new friends. Though I should warn, for some reason the ending is sad, and I still remember it vividly 6 months after the playing the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the time I have played yugioh, I have played decks built only around two themes: DAD, and Blue-Eyes. I guess that helps keep what I think a bit fairer, since instead of comparing the archetypes, I am comparing game styles.
I have played through quite a few formats since I started in the Stratos OTK format.
I think that each format has their charms. The current format is fun for me to play Blue-Eyes, because it is OP. Even DAD has power to back it up. This is not a format of making one play with what you have, have opponent make another play, then counter the opponent. 
It has more search and draw power than ever, so you essentially have your whole deck at your fingertips. At this point it becomes a different kind of skilled game, not one where you try to beat what your opponent has with what you have, but rather to try and not only compute the myriad options you both have and then respond. It has become a game of knowledge, skill and processing. You need to not only know your deck in and out, but also be able to know what to do in each situation.
+1s become irrelevant because you are almost always in a complex game state. Here it is a game of truly countering your opponent and not whittling down your opponent's options.
It is very interesting because you get to do what you want with your deck seeing how consistent stuff is, and luck becomes less of a factor. Of course you can say that it is a dice roll format but in reality its not, because you must utilise your whole deck fully, and not just your hand anymore.

Previous formats, like the Synchro Format or pre-Synchro were slower because you had to make do with what you had. You had options at your disposal because of Synchroes, but the fact that you needed specific cards. and that game states were far more often than not simplified meant that you had to think well before you went into a monster. You did not need that much knowledge about your opponent, but you instead needed information, because one or two power cards could utterly destroy you. Here you need to play the whittling game. Take away your opponents' options, and hope they don't topdeck an answer. 
It becomes a format that requires skill yes, but also luck. Knowing what your opponent could probably do is more important than knowing what your opponent can do with their best cards, since they can't get them. That's why +1s are more relevant. For one, you can't really do more than that, and for two, the game state is usually simplified so your opponent can't recover easily. Your ultimate goal is not to block your opponent entirely, but instead to overcome your opponent's current options, so this is the skill you need: to plus. In the current format, the skill you need is to  stop your opponent. 
Such a format (synchro and pre-synchro) is interesting because here you have less to process, but you still have to maximise your plays. You have to plan for now and the future. Stopping a single play short-circuits the game. You need to guess your opponent's hand and play according to that. 

The early-XYZ format changes that. At this point, you most likely have an answer to what your opponent does, from your extra deck, but you likely have just one. Is it the right time to activate it becomes the proper question. It is all about anticipating the future here. You have more options, but not enough for everything. The game state transitions from Synchro to what it is now. A format like this was fun to play for reasons similar to why the other two were. But those are the reasonable formats.

After those three, there is the ultimate format. Ultimate in the sense that no matter what the hell you do, you are losing. This is personally my third-favorite format, but I am biased because it gave a tier-0 Blue-eyes. The full-power DRuler format. I'm talking super rejuv and dragons at 3 here. This is not a true diceroll format. A true diceroll format is one where you go first and you win for sure. This was one where you go first, and then your opponent goes second, and they kill you, and then you recover. And this continues until the rare bad draw. Your graveyard becomes your second hand. You want to see a format where all the things you described are true and more? This is it. This is the ultimate format for bull. You could lead with a plus 10, and still lose when your opponent has zero cards. In their defence, the deck is not auto-pilot. This was fun to play because ... well it was not fun for anyone except me apparently.

And finally, my favorite format: the limited DRulers without their babies and without super rejuv. A bit like this format, but on a bigger scale. OTKs and stupid good plays abound. But you need to be able to use your resources effectively or else you go out of steam. The plays you could make were Yugi-style stuff, pulling a win out of nowhere if you are lucky. You do what you want, your opponent does what they want, and you try to counter each other and recover from these counters. It was a nice format to play in, because it was all about knowing what to do, a combination of the yugioh of old and the yugioh of new.

I think that those formats are rather different, so I enjoy their idiosyncrasies without comparison.

TL; DR: Current yugioh's theory base is fundamentally different from old yugioh's theory, does not make it automatically bad. Also Blue-Eyes rules everything, especially with DRulers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Future fusion definitely took a nerf. But exactly how common is removal of spell/traps these days? 
Ok yeah removal is really really common. But would you rather have your monster, or solemn hit instead of future fusion. It can act as a fake trap if nothing else. But the true power of FF lies elsewhere.
The ultimate show of power of FF was to dump dragons, summon REDMDs, revive dragons. And then, if in two turns it was still there, you get a 5k beater. That pressurises the opponent. Either you get rid of FF, or you deal with FGD. Pressure is always a good thing, as your opponent will have to go out of their way to destroy future fusion. But by the time they did, your field was already set up, and you losing FF was of no consequence.
With the new FF you could go 1-for-1, perhaps worse. However, the main strength of FF is still its pressure. This time, the opponent has to get rid of it in one turn, or else face huge consequences. On top of that, while you could respond to FGD with monster removal as well, effectively doubling the answer pool. Not anymore. 
This pressure can lead to psychological gameplay. The opponent is more prone to make mistakes to get rid of it. 

They have to squander resources to make sure that the FF is off the field before the effects kick in. Also, because of the delayed dumping, there is extra pressure because they do not know how to respond to your dumping, and you have the advantage because you can simply adapt your gameplan to the opponent's resources. You opponent will have to burn through resources to get rid of it, and if they do, you get a 1-for-1, but if they don't you get +5s or more. 
On top of that, if they do fail to respond to FF in the first turn, they will still have to deal with your monster the next. There is a shorter time frame for an answer.

I know that the previous FF was better because of the instant dumping. But in a more explosive deck like Blue-eyes, this thing has potential. 

Of course, Blue-eyes loves this card, and can't care less if its used against them because of white ka dragon. But then again, it is the master race that nothing can beat. NOTHING </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Future fusion ain't half-bad even with the errata. Its effect is just delayed by one turn. I know a lot can happen in one turn, but that only undermines ff a bit more.
I mean, consider that the most common way of getting rid of s/t is through twin twisters. At the very least you are breaking even with the opponent by playing this, and it acts like a fake trap. 
It also applies immense pressure to the opponent. They will either have to deal with the consequences of ff next turn, and deal with the fusion even faster, or they get rid of it in their turn. They must go out of their way to do that. 
Blue-eyes can abuse this with. I should be able to go plus 5 in one turn, with the potential to get a lot lot more plusses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously, I think we should kill people over a certain age, which would address many issues;

-There is no anxiety or unplanned issues that you have to address

-People too old to work, or to contribute to society, or who need people to take care of them would not burden anyone anymore.

-More homes, from old people's homes, and more food, more medication, more drink and overall more resources. 

-Old people aren't the future. They should not have a say in it. They should not be occupying jobs that young people need. 

-World population is reduced, saving lots of space by getting rid of old people.
And if you feel that it is inhumane, I don't think so. They are kicking the bucket at some age anyways, so why not now?

If anyone is interested, I take only $ 14 000 dollars per head excluding other fees, and you get to decide what kind of death your target needs. I am not limited to old people only either. PM me for details </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like that is not necessarily true. Yes, eventually nothing will matter, but that is about 5 billion years, when the sun dies. But such large time scales are sufficiently disjoint from you that you can consider that this will never happen, and that nothing you do now will affect what happens afterwards. You aren't in the 5 billion year future yet, so focus on the next hundred or thousand years, where your actions now will affect what happens later.
On a separate  but somewhat similar note, this is also the reason why even if space is so vast that what we do here is insignificant for the universe as a whole, it doesn't matter. We don't leave on the scale of the universe. We live on the scale of Earth, and this is where we should measure our actions' impact. This is where actions have meaning. </TEXT>

Basically, when I got easy access to the internet (good connection, with a fast laptop), I used the internet to check up everything. I got interested in many things, like programming, chess and physics.
Since I live in the middle of nowhere, it was quite hard to get proper resources to learn this stuff, not to mention expensive. I took to checking them online, and thus discovered the huge learning opportunities the internet presents.

	<TEXT> In general water molecules tend to stick together because of the surface tension, regardless of whether it is in zero g or not. Now because each molecule is pulling on every other molecule with equal strength, the water has a tendency to form a sphere, like in the gif.

This does not happen on Earth because of gravity. Normally when forming the sphere, the forces of attraction due to particles  have to be all equal. It is as if Bob was between Sally and Jane, and Sally and Jane were pulling him towards them. However, for the surface molecules, there is no Sally, so they collapse and form a sphere in zero g.

In gravity, there is a third girl, Mary, who pulls Bob, Sally and Jane downwards. This takes the droplet in the gif and stretches it downwards, deforming it in the process, and making the water effectively "flow".

The fact that maths is a complete abstraction from the physical world is what makes me gravitate towards physics instead. I'm not saying I don't like math, I love it, but I prefer doing physics because of the thrill you get when you see little numbers on paper translate into something in the physical world. You don't get that with maths. Maths is not really applicable to the real world. Only certain theorems are used, but without the physics giving meaning to those numbers, they are just some symbols on paper
