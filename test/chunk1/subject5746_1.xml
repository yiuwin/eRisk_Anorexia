	<TITLE> First out of the pattern solo </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-27 11:00:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a few hours later than I originally wanted to post this and I'm not sure if it's worth putting up; however I though it might be interesting to write up a little something about my first solo that didn't involve me at an airport (either my home airport, Palo Alto Municipal (KPAO), or one that I flew to with my instructor). This flight took place Thursday (yesterday) afternoon/evening. This was my 4th solo overall.       


A few nights ago I wrote up a little list with all the procedures to follow on the flight, assuming a standard takeoff and departure procedure from KPAO, my first mistake, as I will explain further down.  

I talked with my instructor over the phone about the current weather and got a verbal clearance to go and then when I got to the club I got a CFI at the club to do a check of my documents and endorsements before doing my pre-flight. All in all, that was uneventful despite the fact that the METAR information on AWS was way out of sync with the ATIS, which caused a little initial confusion.  

After taxiing and runup I requested a left downwind departure, which is the standard departure for airports to the South of the peninsula. This is what I had planned for and what I've done every time to date when flying to WVI or E16. Instead I was told to expect a right 270 departure, essentially a right pattern departure with a right turn over the tower in downwind and then a left turn to the South, for noise abatement (so people can watch the game and eat their turkey in peace). Despite being a bit jarring, and having to ask them to explain the maneuver, I rolled with it.  

On the crosswind told I was told instead to continue downwind and do what could best be called a right downwind departure. Over Moffett Field I was frequency changed direct from Palo Alto Tower to Norcal Approach, which was unusual but I can only assume that the Moffett controllers had the day off for the holiday, also since they did the reverse on the way back.  

The rest of the flight to KWVI was fairly uneventful. Norcal decided they wanted me at or below 3000 for most of the way, not unusual considering the big iron flying over head into KSJC. Also, trimming with just me in the plane is still something that I'm getting used to, especially when it comes to longer times at cruise. One minute the trim looks fine, the next it isn't. That wasn't something I noticed when I was just soloing in the pattern, but I think that's something that will improve with more solo practice.  

At KWVI I was able to get pretty decently into the pattern, doing the standard overhead approach to the 45 at "the river and the freeway" but I was wildly high on my first approach and had to go around. The next time around I was still coming in high but I was able to get it down and land and the next three were each better than the last.  

I then was able to takeoff and head back to Palo Alto airport. The return went as well as it could have and even my descent put me in the sweet spot for altitude, 1500ft, at 3 miles out from the field, which made me very happy. The landing was unexceptional except that I was coming in a little fast and had a minor bounce before it settled, but otherwise it was good.  

Hope this wasn't too long and rambling but it was a fun trip and it definitely is a milestone to have done it.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> November Meta Thread </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-06 11:14:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello /r/politics. I hope all of you in the United States are giving thanks this month, all of you in the UK are planning to ~~blow up Parliament~~ remember the Fifth, and of course while youre at it, dont forget your poppies on the 11th.   

As it is the first Friday of the month, this thread is for meta discussion of /r/politics as a subreddit.  We welcome questions about the subreddit and moderation policies, suggestions for improvements, and other comments you might have about the sub.    
 nbsp;  

As a reminder, good titles make good submissions. Per our [title rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_do_not_create_your_own_title.):  
Submissions should have titles comprised of a quote copied and pasted from the article. Do not add, remove words or change words. At the same time, users should be able to focus on what they believe to be the most important parts of an article.  
 
There are a few provisions, outlined in the rule, which is linked above, to make this rule less onerous in certain situations where the source has a bad title; however, this rule has been and will continue to be strictly enforced.  One issue that we have seen lately however, is the source of an article changing the article title. If you have submitted a post and believe that this has happened, please send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/politics) and we will look into it.   
 nbsp;  


One of the most asked about and commented upon rules that we have is our on-topic rule. To maintain the focus of this subreddit we have always remained a hard and fast rule that posts need to be **explicitly** political, per our inclusive [on-topic statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_the_.2Fr.2Fpolitics_on_topic_statement). This has, and will not change; however, we have created a list of related subs, including [quite a few](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/relatedsubs#wiki_general_interest) that are better suited for non-political and implicitly political content.  

Our hard and fast rule on requiring that link-posts to be explicitly political is not going to change. We do however allow more leeway when it comes to self post Saturdays. [Every Saturday, we allow self posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_self-posts_are_allowed_on_saturdays.) (text submissions) instead of only links.  This allows a much greater ability to discuss topics without being bound by a specific article, which could be out of date or more about international politics.  In a self post, you can discuss a topic and make the bridge yourself to how this is explicitly relevant to current US politics.    
 nbsp;  
With the above in mind, we would like to know if there are any ways that you, the users, would like to see the on-topic rule change. In addition, we are always looking for new and exciting ideas for moderator run threads, especially during this upcoming political season.  



 nbsp;  

**The usual boilerplate:**  

* We of course also always accept feedback via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/politics) as well.  
* Any outright personal attacks against any mods or other users will be removed, same as with any other thread in this sub.  
* As always, soliciting users is not allowed. Per our [rules and regulations](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs). The fact that this is a meta thread doesn't change that.    

 nbsp;  
 nbsp;  
Edit: Just noting that the thread has now been unstickied, although mods may still respond to comments if they see them.  So long and thanks for all the fish. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-10-02 22:35:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was doing my first solo yesterday at KWVI (Watsonville Muni), which has two runways 9/27 and 02/20. Despite the fact that the winds clearly favored 27, else was still using 20 (the calm wind runway).  

I can understand people purposefully choosing the crosswind runway to practice crosswind maneuvers, but I have to think that pilots being set in their way and/or stubborn had a lot to do with the fact that we, and then just I, had runway 27 to myself.  

Luckily Watsonville's configuration more or less allows for multiple runway use, assuming people are using their radios and at least making their base, final, and clear of the "active" calls when applicable, but I was wondering how common this type of thing is, when the wind is so clearly favoring one runway over another. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Handling a "request" from ATC to keep speed up </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-06 11:37:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This happened the other day and I wasn't even going to post about it but it's been really bugging me.   
 amp;nbsp;  
Flying into Palo Alto Airport (KPAO) with my instructor, for a straight in to 31 from the South, I got a call from Palo Alto Tower to keep my speed up. I hesitated in responding and they repeated the call. Arguably it could be considered a request, but it sounded a lot like an order.     
 amp;nbsp;    
Since I had my instructor with me and I was only flying at ~2000 RPM (which translated to about 85-90 KIAS) I complied and radioed wilco to the tower, increasing my throttle up to near full power.    
I immediately regretted not saying unable and told my instructor as such, both because he was letting me handle the approach (He was PIC, but I had the controls), and because adding speed decreased the time I had to act in the approach, as well as adding to my workload (albeit minutely).  

He seemed to agree that complying was the wrong thing to do and informed me that if I had been soloing that I would have been obligated to say unable. It still bugs me though that I gave in that quickly.     
 amp;nbsp;    
Other than to share this story I was wondering if anyone here had any advice on how to handle situations like this in the future.  I know that 91.3(a) gives me the utmost authority to say unable (even though I'm not technically the PIC with my instructor), but that's easy to say on the ground (a point that came up in the post-flight).  
 amp;nbsp;  
Edit: to clarify that I wasn't technically PIC on the flight since I was with my instructor and I don't have my private pilot's license yet.    
 nbsp;  
Edit 2: thank you all for the great responses. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIL: There are designated airports with backup power in case of catastrophic power failure </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-05 11:41:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Figured this might interest people. In case of some sort of catastrophic power failure, there are specific facilities across the US and Canada with backup power to maintain minimal operations and allow for landing.  
 nbsp;  
This is from page 374 in the current (20 Aug 2015) AF/D:  
 nbsp;  

SPECIAL NOTICES
CONTINUOUS POWER FACILITIES 
In order to insure that a basic ATC system remains in operation despite an areawide or catastrophic commercial power failure, key equipment and certain airports have been designated to provide a network of facilities whose operational capability can be utilized independent of any commercial power supply.   
 nbsp;  
In addition to those facilities comprising the basic ATC system, the following approach and lighting aids have been included in this program for a selected runway. 

1.  ILS(Localizer, Glide Slope, COMLO, 
Inner, Middle and Outer Markers) 
2.  Wind Measuring Capability 
3.  Approach Light System (ALS) or Short ALS (SALS) 
4.  Ceiling Measuring Capability 
5.  Touchdown Zone Lighting (TDZL) 
6.  Centerline Lighting (CL) 
7.  Runway Visual Range (RVR) 
8.  High Intensity Runway Lighting (HIRL) 
9.  Taxiway Lighting 
10.  Apron Light (Perimeter Only)   
  
 nbsp;  
The  following  have  been  designated  Continuous  Power  Airports,  and  have  independent back up capability for the equipment installed.

	<TITLE> Question regarding Moffett Field </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-26 12:04:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Actually two questions and hopefully since a lot of you are based in the Bay Area (like I am), someone have some experience or knowledge to give some insight. Thanks in advance, these are two that have just been bugging me for awhile as I've flown around Moffett.  
 nbsp;  
1) Is there any way to get permission to land at Moffett? I know the Google lease does, or will, change things, since their lease ostensibly includes the two runways, but I figured I'd ask this in case someone knows whether special permission can **actually** (I know they do publish a contact number) be obtained to even do a touch and go there.  
 nbsp;  
2) When the Air National Guard and/or Google and/or NASA aren't using the field, do the controllers just sit around waiting for the next downwind departure from PAO, or approach to 31 to ask to transition their airspace?  
They are actually [covered by LiveATC](http://www.liveatc.net/search/?icao=KNUQ), but they've just seemed so excited every time I called, I was wondering what they do there all day besides transitions and hand-offs between KPAO and NorCal App. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has been a long time since our last Meta thread so we are looking for some feedback. We are interested in knowing what works well, what we can improve on, and anything else about the sub you'd like to talk about.  

We'd also like to know what you'd like in terms of features and coverage you'd like going into the next presidential election cycle.   
 nbsp;  
Going forward, we are planning on doing these meta posts on a monthly basis on the first weekend of each month. In some of these posts we may ask if you can give us specific feedback on something, but for the most part these are open threads where you can ask us questions or give us feedback on policy. We of course also always accept feedback via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/politics) as well.

There are a few things to point out though:  

1. **NO, we won't get rid of the on-topic rule**. We're happy to discuss refining it, but getting rid of it would be unworkable and the overall quality of the subreddit would suffer.  

2. We're happy to hear your criticism and your critiques. You can say that we're all working for the lizard men if you want, but **outright personal attacks against any mods or other users will be removed**. Use your good judgement and think before you click submit, please.  
3. There are no lizard men - signed, the mole men  
4. As always, soliciting users is not allowed. Per our [rules and regulations](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs). The fact that this is a meta thread doesn't change that.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Today I had my first (official) discovery flight, even though it was really my first flight lesson more than a discovery flight (long story).   
 nbsp;  
That got me thinking about critical, and less than critical, issues that get reported about rental planes.  Luckily the one that was already issued on the plane, a non-critical piece being inop) and the three we ran into in pre-flight were not serious enough to stop the flight.  
 nbsp;  
The three we found were:    

* Landing light inoperable
* Loose engine cowling fastener
* Abnormal wear on right tire (luckily not yet down to the threads)    


I have to imagine that all three of those are pretty standard, and explainable but I was wondering what other common ones you have all run across. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm re-reading Raising Steam right now and the scene where Moist is (yet again) summoned to Vetinari's office made me think that, had the series continued, The Patrician's time in office might have been near ending.  

With that being said, Who do you all think would have replaced him?  

 nbsp;  

I don't think it would have been Carrot, since even if he would step up if absolutely necessary, he'd just ask nicely that nobody make him do it and someone else would be found. That IMO leaves Vimes or Moist and I'd argue that Moist is who Vetinari was grooming for the role eventually, by giving him increasing responsibilities. Vimes on the other hand is great at what he does but hates paperwork and work that keeps him away from **his** streets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found this sub about 6 months ago, set my flair, subscribed, and then forgot about it, only occasionally coming back to read when I saw it on my subscribed list. I figured it was about time to finally sit down and write something here and get an intro thread posted (I think I may have actually posted a comment previously).   
.  
A little bit about myself, I don't read as much as I used to but I love books, especially science fiction and historical nonfiction, although my nonfiction interests are very wide. I am a video gamer (Playstation is always  than Xbox) and am a fan of the Call of Duty Games, and Grand Theft Auto.  I am working on getting my pilot's license as well, although that is going slowly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is more of a philosophical point than an actual question but at some point we're going to run out of accounts that were created before 2015-04-01.  

I would argue that people should not not push the button for fear of... **DOUBLE NEGATIVE ERROR -- RESTARTING STATEMENT**  
.  
I would argue that people should push the button as they would otherwise because moderating button pushes without group coordination and without a guarantee by other potential pushers that they shouldn't push the button until their time comes, and then they should push the button, but only at that time, will lead to button pushing anarchy. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How I invest in Lending Club (x-post /r/personalfinance) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-14 05:46:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I originally posted this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/35rjnp/lendingclubcom_good_idea_or_bad_idea_to_invest/cr8jn5l?context=3). Your mileage may vary so don't take my word for any of this, do your own research and figure out what works for you if you.  
.  
Currently, I have 104 notes, that are live (so excluding fully paid and not yet issued notes). I have $25 in each note ($2600 total) and they are all current right now. My Net Annual Return is 10.85%. As a caveat, I should note that they are all fairly young notes so that **will** change in the future.   

 I use two methods to determine what notes are purchased through the automated investment system:  

* First, is the grade distribution, which the system unfortunately does not let you override, even though my filter is set in a way that largely makes it irrelevant (my filter is strict enough to pretty much eliminate all D,E,F, and G notes)  
  Because I can't use my filter to set distribution I have had to constantly tweak my percentages to allow me to get new notes that fit my criteria as they come available. That admittedly sidesteps/weakens the diversification element achieved through LC's rating system; however, I have confidence in my filter so I feel comfortable doing so. I would only recommend tweaking your ratings constantly if you know the risk and know what you are doing.  
  
 * My current distribution of note grades is set to:   
 * A: 17%
 * B: 40%
 * C: 43%  

* Secondly, is my filter. I'm just going to go down the list and write out how I have it set with brief footnotes. Any settings that I don't mention are unchecked if they're checkmark boxes or otherwise left at their default (unless it's something I obviously forgot, in which case call me on it).  
.  
.  

* Initial listing status: Both    

 Unless you are investing a fantastical amount of money, you aren't going to be investing in whole loans, and even then, it's probably not advisable from a diversification standpoint. I gather that whole loan notes are fairly uncommon anyway.  

 * Months since last record: 60  
 Public records are things like bankruptcies and defaults. Setting this high weeds out the loans from people shown to be a bad bet when previously being given credit.  

 * Inquiries in the last 6 months: 5    
 Certain actions, such as looking into getting a new car loan, credit card, or mortgage can shoot this number right up since it counts hard inquiries (such as inquiries to get a new line of credit or increase an existing line of credit). If you set this too low then you will remove a whole bunch of otherwise good loans; however, you don't want people who are just racking up credit and burning through it.  

 * Monthly income: 0 to  20,000  
 Might be a little controversial, but income != ability to repay, especially when other filters are in place to limit how much credit the borrower has and is using at a time. This is another slightly redundant filter because of the other filters and the affect on the number of available loans should be measured before raising this too much.   

 * Total credit lines: 10 maximum  
 See the open credit lines section before for more on this, but this is to catch people who quickly open and close credit lines. There can be legitimate reasons for this being high, especially since accounts stay on the report for 7 years + 180 days (delinquent and collected accounts) or 10 years (accounts closed in good standing), but too many credit lines on the credit report is a major red flag for me.

 * Listing expires in: Any  
 IMO not a relevant factor  

 * Loan purpose: Consolidate debt 
 Unlike other loan types this loan is not increasing the borrower's debt, nor does it increase their spending. In fact, quite the opposite. Everything I have read has led me to believe that this is the the lowest risk loan type to invest in.  

 * Credit score: 660 to 850   
 I tried tweaking this, and I may again at some point, but all increasing it did was exclude most if not all of the possible loans. Credit score also lags behind reality, as in, by the time that someone's credit score is hit, they've already been a risk, hurt their credit from that risk, and tried to move on. Along with the fact that I'm doing debt consolidation loans, using other factors such as public records, inquiries, number of credit lines, , derogatories, and utilization to weed people out seems to work better.  


 * Public records: exlude loans with public records   
 May or may not be redundant with months since last public record, depending on public records falling off of credit reports. This is pretty much a fail safe to stop loans from getting through with older bankruptcies or defaults that are still on the borrower's record.  

 * Funding progress: 0%  
 This is **minimum** funding percentage. Because of the other checks in my filter, plus the checks that Lending Club has in place before a loan is issued, I don't mind being one of the first people in on a loan. I don't have a benchmark to compare with, but a fairly high percentage of loans that I fund get issued. That's a good thing IMO because it means that Lending Club is weeding out, for whatever reason, many loans and the consensus of other users (through automated investing and/or filters and/or manually selecting loans) works to each lender's advantage too.

 * Min length of employment: 5 years   
  Ask pretty much anyone who extends credit, this is a biggie because it shows income stability and it lends itself to the idea that the person, barring some unforeseen event, will be bringing in money to pay back the loan  

 * Exclude relisted loans: exclude relisted  
 Don't want the returns, if a loan has been rejected then I'm not interested. I'm not sure what constitutes a relist to Lending Club so it's possible that this catches some loans that were relisted for a typo or some other innocuous reason.  

 * Major derogratory:  60  
 This is months since the last major derogatory mark (which seems to be 90 or more days over due) on the borrower's credit report.  

 * Open credit lines: 0 to 10  
 Per the total credit lines option, more lines of credit = more risk and a higher chance that yours will be the bill that's put off or not paid.  Looking at the statistics on CreditKarma, a lot of people have a large number of credit lines open (you actually get a slight credit boost from having more credit open, as long as your utilization is good and you pay on time). This is something I wish could be tweaked down, but doing so pretty much kills the number of loans.  

 * Location state: all  
 IMO, not particularly relevant to anything. Even if there was a sudden wave of defaults in one state, it would be too late at that point and not investing in that state's loans would have minimal to no effect.  

 * Max loan amount up to: 35,000  
 IMO, not relevant because delinquincies, credit balance, and utilization, among other factors, negate the slightly higher risk from bigger loans.  

 * Delinquincies (last 2 yrs): 0   
 Should be pretty self explanatory, probably redundant with derogatory marks and records filters.  

 * Revolving credit balance: less than $50,000  
 Credit without a fixed rate repayment, so this doesn't include car loans or mortgages but it does include credit cards and home equity credit. This is a big one and I could probably tighten it up even more.  

 * Home ownership: any  
 I tried tweaking this, it just caused problems. In this day and age, many people rent by choice because it makes more economical sense so there isn't necessarily a correlation between renting and higher risk.  

 * Exclude loans invested in:   
 Self explanatory, I invest $25 per loan for a reason so I don't want to invest in the same loan twice.  

 * Max debt-to-income ratio: 30%  
 Another one I tried to tweak down with various consequences. More debt = more risk, yet again so it's good to get people who are bringing in more income than they have debt. Obviously this doesn't equal free income, because the borrower can still be spending a lot of their income on month to month expenses, but it means they aren't taking on excessive debt.  
  
 * Loan term: 36 month  
 This is a personal choice based entirely on what I feel comfortable with. I've thought about dabbling in 60 month loans, but a shorter loan means fewer payments to start with for the borrower (allowing them hopefully a greater chance to pay off early) and a shorter time for them to potentially get into trouble.  

 * Months since last delinquency: 60 months or more  
 Per the above related items, I don't want anything to do with borrowers who have shown themselves to be credit risks in recent history. Since Lending Club gives us no better way to determine if the borrower is still a credit risk, it is best not to take the chance that they are still having issues.  

 * Interest rate: all  
 Irrelevant due to the other criteria pretty much excluding D and lower loans. I kept my distribution settings to allow D loans when I first started and zero came up as meeting my filter criteria so I'm reasonably sure that this isn't an issue.  

 * Earliest credit line: 10 years or more  
 In conjunction with the rest of the history based filters, this is using the very limited tools Lending Club makes available to get a picture of the person's credit history. It's tough to get comfortable with a person being a credit risk or not based on a short credit history.  

 * Collections excluding medical: 0  
  Again, eliminating people with credit issues on their account.  

 * Revolving balance utilization: any  
 I had to double check this because I was sure I had it set to something but if I remember correctly, from my testing it was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I have debt to income and other filters that catch high utilization borrowers. I will be revisiting this one though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Youtube will not load unless you let Google Analytics load as well </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-28 01:50:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As a rule I block Google Analytics on every app that tries to load it, both on a system (and in the case of web browsers, browser level).   
.  
In changing one of my system level blockng rules (using Little Snitch) from applying to specific applications to applying system wide, I discovered that Youtube will not load unless you allow the domain www-google-analytics.l.google.com to load.  
.  
I figured this might interest some people here because this is a major site forcing users to allow tracking (at least access to the domain for tracking) to load before loading the site. Not only that, they aren't even forcing you to allow the ssl domain (ssl-google-analytics.l.google.com), only the unsecure domain.  
.  
To Duplicate, for anyone who may be interested:   

* Go to youtube.com to make sure it loads to begin with
* Use your hosts file or software firewall to block the domain www-google-analytics.l.google.com  
* attempt to go to youtube.com
* remove the blocking rule  
* force refresh (ctrl + F5 on Windows, Cmd (Apple) + R on Mac)
* Youtube should again load as normal

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the Star Wars universe Bothans are the best spies in the universe, and while not all Bothans are probably spies, enough of them are that their whole species has the reputation of being really good spies. That being said, with the number and quality of Bothan spies, would anyone trust a Bothan not to be spying on them even if they said they weren't?  
.  
Edit to note that this would seem to preclude the idea that you are trusting a Bothan who you are paying to spy for you. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about ATIS "use caution birds in the vicinity" warning </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-15 14:32:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I tried to do a search here and on Google about this but with no real luck. When listening to an ATIS I, hear quite often, I'd anecdotally say probably more often than not, a warning about using caution because of birds in the vicinity.  
.  
I was wondering if anyone knew if the warnings are standard CYA (cover your ass) warnings that are included at any airport with a possibility of a bird strike, or whether they are specifically included based on actual bird activity for a given time period? Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Cex.io scamming their cloud mining users out of their BTC balances </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-04 11:07:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all, I want to say that I have never bought into the Cex.io/Ghash.io hatred so this isn't about that. This is about an issue that has been happening for some time and that they refuse to fix while giving smarmy half-assed responses to that justify what is IMO a scam.  
.  
In short, what they are doing is charging more per block than the block is paying out (**Note: this happens, if it takes more than two hours to find a block**), not just occasionally but systematically. That fee is deducted from your BTC balance and if you don't have enough then it drives your BTC balance into the negative. This doesn't effect NMC or other coins that are mined through cloud mining (whether it would effect cashing out earned NMC or trying to sell GHS (Ghz) directly to USD to avoid the negative BTC balance, I don't know).  
.  
As I said, this is shady as all hell though, and the following response is absolutely ridiculous. This is doubly true IMO considering how much the sell-back value of GHS has decreased, thanks in no small part to a concerted effort from this subreddit to spike their business. Regardless of the reasons though, they are acting in bad faith towards their customers.  
.  

XXXXXXX (CEX.IO)

Dear YYYYYYYYYYYYYY,

I have performed the check on your account and it seems that the maintenance fees you are charged with are indeed correct. With the current low price of USD/BTC and the high difficulty climbs of late the block mining time has to be less than 2 hours in order for the mining reward to cover the maintenance fee. Due the to situation, I apologise that you are experiencing concern over your mining operations. We are working for alternative ways to charge the maintenance fees and have already encouraged the community to write several suggestions for this kind of alternative, and others.

https://support.cex.io/hc/en-us/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93 topic=200082417 query=FEes commit=Search

Let me know if you need any more help with this question.

Regards,
XXXXXXX
CEX.IO Support  

.  
The X's and Y's are to anomyize it, both because it isn't right to go after a customer service rep for doing his or her job and for my privacy. I also removed the timestamp for the same reason.    
.   
Edit: Clarifying per the comment below, the cost exceeds the payout if it takes more than two hours to successfully find a block. </TEXT>

So what bands or bands' fans do you think are stereotyped.  Optionally, do you think the stereotypes are justified? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Contest] 12 Day(s) of Christmas Contest </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-02 15:59:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Upon the advice of three ghostly spirits that visited me last night I have decided to hold a little contest to celebrate the holiday spirit.
.  
The contest is this, guess the spot price of silver at close (12:25pm EST) on December 24th to win the prize. That evening at the latest, I will pull up APMEX and use the bid price to determine the winner. **Entries will be accepted until 12:25pm EST on December 12**, allowing for 12 days after entries close.  
.  
The prize may be something out of my collection or if I cannot bear to part with any of my pieces, something that I order up specifically for the occasion. The prize will be at least 1 ounce, possibly more.  
.  
Edit: Edited to note that the market closing time is in EST  
.  
Edit 2: Anyone who has already been in a contest knows these by now but I forgot the general statement that tie guesses go to whoever guessed first, if there's an even split then both closest people will get something, and if you edit your post then it is disqualified, delete your post and re-post if you have to (although if someone beats you to re-posting your guess they get the guess).  **There will be no chance to re-guess after the deadline so check the existing guesses before posting yours**.  
.  
Edit 3: The title was me trying to make a bit of a humorous joke, nothing more. Everyone gets **ONE GUESS**, not one per day.  
.  
Edit 4: I realize this is getting ridiculous but I appreciate everyone's patience with this being my first time running a contest. I wanted to note that I am not setting an account age limit on entry except for the fact that the account has to have been created prior to the the contest starting on 12/02. None of these clarifications to the rules have, to my knowledge, affected any of the current entrants nor do they give any entrant or set of entrants (current or future) an advantage. I hope this will be my last edit to this post until the twelfth.  
.  
* TO HELP PREVENT DUPLICATE GUESSES, SEE [THIS TABLE](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2o4wfu/table_for_12_days_of_silverbugs_contest/). It has all of the guesses that I have formally entered for the contest. I will try to update it at least a few times a day so please also check the guesses since the last entry before posting yours.  
.  
Edit 5: The deadline for entries was ambiguous because I didn't specify AM or PM so I have made sure to specify that it is PM and changed it from 12:01 to 12:05. I also changed it from PST to EST so that the times match up, although, I realize that gives people three fewer hours to enter. If anyone objects to me shaving off those three hours, please let me know but the changes make from time entries close to market close on Christmas Eve day exactly 12 days per the spirit of the contest. 

This should, hopefully, be my last edit until the 12th.   
.  
Edit 6: 12:25pm not 12:05pm per the CME Group's holiday [settlement schedule](http://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/holiday-calendar/files/2014-christmas-holiday-settlement-times.pdf).  
.  
Also, please check that your guesses are on the table and PM me if they are older than the latest guess on the table and aren't yet on the table. I have gotten reports of comments not always showing up so your guess may have been missed if that occurred. I will be doing final checks after entries close to make sure that all guesses have been counted and that guesses are valid within valid/present comments from non-deleted/shadowbanned users; however, any guesses disqualified at that point will remain disqualified so re-guess now if you need to.  
.  
.  
EDIT 7: **ENTRIES ARE NOW CLOSED**  
.  
Good luck everyone who entered </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for someone willing to forward on 4 packages from Royal Canadian Mint to US over the course of 2015 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-17 14:30:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ~~This isn't quite a pmsforsale post nor is it the regular fare of this subreddit so I'm hope that this is enough in the rules that it doesn't get nuked.  
.  
I want to purchase the "2015 Canadian Silver Coin Subscription" (mods, please let me know if I can link and I will) from the Royal Canadian Mint but it is one of the few products that they, for whatever reason, will not ship to the US (maybe because it's a subscription?). The subscription consists of four coins sent over the course of 2015 (in January, March, May, and September).  
.  
I was hoping a Canadian might be able and willing to forward the packages if I gave their address as the shipping address. I believe~~ ~~I can actually pay for the order myself and I'd be willing to immediately send via Paypal or another agreed upon form of payment a reasonable amount to cover shipping for all four packages so that there would be zero risk of the sender losing money. I'd prefer someone with a solid history here but I'd appreciate it anyone would be willing to help me out.~~  
.  
~~Edit: I went through every step short of confirming the order, using the Toronto City Hall as the shipping address, so unless it checks the address only while confirming (unlikely), then I can pay for everything on the mint side myself.~~   
.  
~~Edit 2: I meant but forgot to mention in my original post that I would also be willing to compensate anyone willing to do this for their time and effort, probably in silver.~~  
.  
Edit 3: Thank you everyone who offered but I was made aware that this was a much worse deal than I thought so I'm not going to be buying these. Thanks again though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Included below is an email I just received from FAASafety.gov since I'm on a number of their email lists (it's a good way to learn about miscellaneous topics).  
.  
I've gotten these notices a number of times and I was wondering if happens to know what this type of testing entails, both on their end and what the effects are, or at least could be, on pilots?

	<TITLE> Link never truly wins </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-12 12:55:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've read the timelines, and how there are all sorts of endings where Link ends up living out his days peacefully, generally thanks to restoring the timeline to before it got all mucked up, but I realized that Link, in whatever incarnation he takes, never truly wins.  
.  
To be clear, he always wins in the sense that he defeats the villain of the week (in a manner of speaking), but he never gets the girl [Zelda], he generally doesn't even get to keep the cool sword and the extra gear that he picked up along the way. It's even questionable whether the relevant incarnation of link remembers his previous adventures when it's all over (various games seem to conflict on that).  
.  
I kind of have to ask then, other than the fact that some legend of the "hero of X [x being dependent on the game]" seems to survive, what's the point for Link? Being brave and selfless, the defining qualities of Link as a character (set of characters?) is one thing, but even if he isn't doing it for the bravery, he's risking everything for no reward.  
.  
Edit: I want to make it perfectly clear that, to an extent, I am playing devil's advocate here. I understand the notion that as the hero, both as an archetype and as he is often titled, he is completely selfless and doesn't hesitate to rush into danger to save Hyrule. From some of the replies, you'd think I was suggesting that he close the shades, pour himself a cup of tea, and watch Springer while Ganondorf's darkness devoured the world outside his tree-house.  
.  
Edit 2: selfless, not selfish </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The title says it all. I can't be the only person here who browses through the [ASRS](http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/) database of reports of everything from pilot errors to equipment malfunctions.  
.  
With that in mind, I'm wondering what the best story people have read is, whether it is something that you learned from, made you laugh, or shocked you, and why. If you happen to know or can find the reference number that would be great but if not just what you remember from it.  If you submitted it yourself feel free to say so but don't feel obliged to. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question regarding tolerable variances in pieces (just measured three questionable pieces) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-03 00:01:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some of my earliest purchases were off [eBay](https://imgur.com/a/WZD6L) and I was advised [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1ttonx/the_latest_additions_to_my_collection/) to check them out because I had my suspicions and others confirmed that I should be suspicious of them. Today I got my new scale (as recommended [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1tpjnn/looking_for_scale_recommendations/)) so I checked the pieces out.  
.  
I obviously don't want to be ridiculously paranoid, because I realize that there are variances in size and weight, especially since the pieces aren't 100% silver so they may not register as exactly 31.1g, however I want to be sufficiently paranoid so that if I decide to give away or sell any of these pieces I don't have to feel like I have to warn the recipient and/or feel bad about potentially selling or giving bad product, both because of the seller risk and the moral/ethical duty involved.  
.  
My question is, what do you all use for your benchmarks when determining what falls into line and do you think that these results are acceptable?  I realize this is long and a lot to read but I'd appreciate any insight might have.  
. 

Here are the results:  
.  


|                    | * Stagecoach Round * | * Stagecoach Bar * | * Skull and Snake bar *     | 
|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:------------------------:|
| Spec weight         |          31.1g   |     31.1g       |     31.1g     
| Actual weight       |          31.1g   |     31.2g       |     31.2g     
| Spec Diameter       |          39mm    |     n/a         |     n/a  
| Actual diameter     |          39.18mm |     n/a         |     n/a
| Spec length         |          n/a     |     50mm        |     n/a
| Actual length       |          n/a     |     50.42mm     |     50.33 
| Spec width          |          n/a     |     29mm        |     n/a  
| Actual width        |          n/a     |     29.5mm      |     29.33mm  
| Spec thickness      |          2.87mm  |     2.1mm       |     n/a       
| Actual thickness    |          2.89mm  |     2.48mm      |     2.44mm    
.  

* Note: There are no specs for the Skull and Snake bar

* The Scale I am using is accurate to 0.2g with a 0.1g resolution and the caliper is accurate to 0.01mm but in practice that's  0.01mm because I'm hand tuning in the caliber (I am doing multiple measurements to make sure though to ensure accuracy).

	<TITLE> [Intro] On the idea of paying it forward </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-29 23:21:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Figured I'd try something different for an intro. Having seen the ad post for this in /r/bitcoin I decided to write up a little treatise on this concept. This is all just my point of view and I welcome, in fact hope for, discussion including disagreement with my point of view in the comments.    
.  

Something like /r/RandomActsOfBTC is a good idea for a number of reasons. For one, it keeps bitcoins moving which strengthens the community as a whole. For another, it allows people who are new to bitcoin to have a small amount to use without having to go through the often arduous hurdle of buying them for themselves, and without taking the risk of doing so.  
.

The entire concept of a pay it forward system, which is what Random Acts of BTC is, is predicated on there always be more people willing to give, or more accurately people willing to give more, than there are people willing to receive. As long as that is the case the idea will thrive, people will keep paying it forward (hopefully paying forward at least some percentage of what they receive to supplement what new donors bring in) and the system will thrive. Without donors this experiment (for lack of a better word) will wither and die.   
.  

I greatly hope for the former, rather than the latter and am glad to be taking part of what I hope to be only the early stages of this subreddit. </TEXT>

Mainly, if you can't/won't risk the piece quality by using an acid test, do you consider weight a good measure? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spurred on by [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1tp7vd/mom_and_mom_in_law_win/), I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a scale to get. Preferably I think I'd want one that can do grams and ounces to two decimal places but nothing that's too expensive. Thanks.

Edit: Zuizide suggested [this](http://www.rakuten.com/pr/product.aspx?sku=241963926). </TEXT>
