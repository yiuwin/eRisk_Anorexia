	<TEXT> Every time we started to make a run, Portland made a big shot. It was unreal. They were even shooting like 45% from the line. We are lucky we didn't lose by 30. 

We just couldn't hit a shot tonight either. But luckily there are 82 games, but games like tonight are must wins if we want to make the playoffs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would go to Puzata Khata. They have so many different options there, but you have to get the Cherry Verenikiy. They are delicious! Of course you also have to try Ukrainian Borsch, and you should get the meatballs (freekadelli) there. 

You could always try sala too. But I would also recommend pelmenni and then if you can you have to buy Day and Night cookies! They are delicious as well as Super Kontiki! 

Wow I miss Ukrainian food. You can also try Kvas -- it is a popular child drink. 

One more recommendation is to buy the juice there. There are so many delicious juices! I prefer peach and pear juice. So good! I am jealous you get to go to Ukraine! Although, February is probably the coldest greyest month of they year hahaha. But enjoy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watched it last night and was going to start a thread like this, so I am glad you did. 

I liked the film, I spent two years living in Ukraine so it had a very personal touch to it. I liked that I got to see footage I had not seen before and I learned a few new things from it as well. 

It was very pro-maidan, but to be honest, if it had been anything but that I don't think I would have left feeling very good about it. It is incredible and scary to me to think of what the Ukrainian government was doing to it's own people, and it brought it very close and to life for me. 

I was hoping for a little bit more of something out of it, though I am not quite sure what that would be. Overall, it was good, but it was lacking something and I am not sure if I can put my finger on it. Does anybody else feel that way about it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey thanks Cur2394 for the compliments and the clarification! Yes, those tunnels are just outside of Bryce! They are really cool. If you head to Bryce from I15, they are impossible to miss, and they are definitely worth seeing in my opinion! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Monaco is really cool if you get the chance to make it out there for the weekend along with Nice and Cannes. You should definitely make a trip or two out there over the weekend so you can take in the art, the city, and the beach! If you will be there for the Grand Prix, that would be cool too! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Commuting into Salt Lake isn't that great no matter if you come from the north or south, and traffic going home is going to be terrible as well. Your best bet may be Tooele or Stansbury Park. You can always decide to go up Parley's Canyon towards Heber/Midway or Wanship.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a big fan of Halloween, so I once attended this Halloween Masquerade that was incredible. 

It was by invite only, so you felt like you were a special guest, and the point of the dance was a fundraiser for charity. 

Everybody there felt like they were VIP's, the music was great, the space was intimate yet elegant, and they provided drinks and food for the guests.

	<TEXT> They may not be the best milkshakes in town, but The University Pharmacy has milkshakes half off on Saturday, so they are only like $1.80 for a big shake. 

They are still delicious.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My list:

Visit Park City - You can shop at the outlets, eat good food, and walk down historic main street.

Ensign Peak - This is a short hike right in the city that gives you a great view of the city! It has historical significance to the state. 

Temple Square -- Walk around it. Biggest tourist attraction in the city.

Salt Flats -- You can make the hour or so drive out west and see the salt flats. They are pretty cool, but there isn't much else to do out that way if you decide to do this. 

Places to Eat: 

Red Iguana --- Best Mexican food in the city! Expect at 30-45 minute wait to be seated though.

Ruth's Diner -- Great place for breakfast or brunch. Can have a long wait, but also really good food! 

Tin Angel -- They serve lots of gluten free options (not sure if that is applicable to you). 

Redrock --- Serve some delicious bar food.

Setabello -- Italian style pizza with a great gelato place attached to it! 

Moochies --- Best Philly Cheesestakes I have ever had. And that is including from Philly. Their jalapeno sauce that you put ontop is incredible! Must go here. 

Chanan Thai --- My favorite Thai place in the city. It is enough food to last you a couple of meals, or it is one giant meal.

Aristos- Good greek food up near the University of Utah. 

The Pie --- The college hangout place. I would actually recommend going here to get their cheese pull aparts or their cinaparts. Both are delicious.
