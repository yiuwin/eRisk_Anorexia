	<TEXT> As an asexual person, I have to put up with people treating me like I'm broken because I am free of those desires. I find that unwanted sexual advances anger me. I have to put up with people reading into what I wear sometimes, since I'm innocent and free of sexuality, I can wear or do almost anything in innocence and without shame. So I have to put up with others projecting their dirty minds onto things I do with the most innocent and nonsexual of motives, and that offends me.

To me, beyond its biological role, it is boring. I don't hate it nor oppose it, since obviously I wouldn't be here if it didn't exist. But it should be taken in perspective, not worshiped nor done to the exclusion of other things. It is something we can enjoy, but we should never let it rule us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the best option would be to wait a bit longer and save as much money as you can, as from the experience of my two brothers you'll have little chance to save once you have moved out. I am 19 and will be moving out to attend uni in the next month (don't know if it counts as moving out.)
