	<TEXT> I was just joking, lol. The maze is pretty accurate though at describing addictions. The maze is dark but the entrance is full of light, which makes it painful to just walk out of. Instead we wander the maze looking for another exit, an easier one. Of course, no such exit exists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sucks. I had an injury on my left arm when I was arm bared during a competition, so I know how it feels. If you don't mind me asking, why did you give up working out completely? Have you considered going for runs, trying to find exercises that don't require your arm(s)? Just want to see if I can help you find a way to keep those urges at bay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Begin by improving yourself, and you will no longer feel inadequate. There are many options when it comes to self-improvement; NoFap is just one of them. In addition to NoFap you should try and find a hobby or skill you enjoy doing, and become better at that (sports, writing, art, academics, etc. The list is endless). You can also find a goal you want to achieve, and focus on completing that goal (90 days NoFap, 90 days cold showers + meditation, lose X amount of weight, gain X amount of muscle, etc). Hope that helps, best of luck. </TEXT>

All we can do is accept our shortcoming, and move on with greater resolve.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I agree with him insofar that we should that we should tackle each day as it comes, live each day to our fullest. That said, I think not taking into account the past or future is foolish. Counting days allows us to see the progress we make on a grander scale. And looking toward a goal of say 90 days gives us something concrete to aim for. And I agree with you that a "relapse is okay" mentality is wrong to have. Like you said, this journey needs to be taken seriously, and a serious mindset is necessary to succeed. </TEXT>
