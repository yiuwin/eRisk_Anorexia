	<TEXT> I'm trying to find an action/adventure animated series that I have very fond (but vague) memories of from the late 90's/possibly early 2000's, IIRC it was set in modern times, the hero had black, spiky hair and wore a red jacet, his right-hand man had red hair and always called the hero "commander", I remember a scene in one episode where a recurring villain (who was chinese, bald and fat) had died and the hero says "(insert villain's name here) has returned to his ancestors" or something similiar, and a scene in another episode where the hero tells the sidekick about a revolver they had just found, explaining that 8-shooters were'nt invented until such and such date, and only 6-shooters should exist in the time they're in (time travel episode perhaps :) 

if you can recognise the cartoon from that measly bit of information please let me know, i've been trying to find it for ages.
Much obliged. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was wondering if any of you could tell me the origin or source of this phrase, twice in the last two years i've heard two different people use it, both times on the subject of the Charlie Hebdo massacre, two different guys from two different counties (Kerry and Cork) both said this using the exact same wording "they seem to think they can make fun of anything, no consequences!".
appreciate any answers. </TEXT>
