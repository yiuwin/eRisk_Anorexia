	<TEXT> Only doing map 3-7

MAP 3: Got on, thought I could h@ck and win the server, figured out that I couldn't, got mad, left for a little while, came back and died a lot.

MAP 4: Basically a noob through most of this map, died a shitton, made a faction with some guy, and we called it Amnesia I believe, he left the server shortly afterwards.  3/4 of the way through the map I discovered the subreddit and started lurking around. I saw a post by (gtwillwin?) and I commented on it, hoping to join ShadowWalk, If I can find the link, I'll post it. Anyways, I joined SW and I played with them for the rest of the map.


MAP 5: Played with ShadowWalk, first full map SOTW-EOTW, Met most of the people I am still friends with today, I was in the sister faction to ShadowWalk, ShadowRaid, as the member cap was introduced. ShadowRaid/walk was my favorite part of HCF ever. 


MAP 6: ShadowWalk again, grand base, one of the best I've seen. We had many run ins with Legendary and picked up a few guys along the way, this, sadly, was the last map of ShadowWalk.


MAP 7: I led a draft faction named Apocalypse, it was somewhat successful, we capped KOTH first out of everyone but that was about it. I also died in the stupidest ways that I could that map, falling mostly. Server population dropped to like 2 people on at peak.

I live in Cali so great ping(12ms at best)

I am a great all-around addition to a faction never too lazy to do anything really.

Past Factions:Old ShadowWalk, Accido(officer), TowerTech, Lucky7, 8Ball, and ThirdLaw.

I have not betrayed any of the big factions that I've been in (sry eaglebagel if your reading) 

My pvp skills are a 7/10

My mining skills are 7-8/10

My chillness skills are 9000/10

Thanks for looking at my post!

-Chaseair115

TL;DR: good all around player, been in quite a few factions.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, I'm Chaseair115, and I'm an alcoholic...

I joined HCF map 3 and have played continuously since then, with the exception of map 8. 


PVP: still getting better, as I have practiced I would say I am a 7/10 in diamond and a 8/10 with archer.

Previous factions: ShadowWalk, Hypnotoad (for like 3 days), Freeshot, ThirdLaw, ShadowWalk/Accido, 8BALL,  
TowerTech, Apocalypse,and a couple of small factions.

Experience: I have been a leader to a couple of factions, and have been an officer in ShadowWalk/ Accido and the small factions that I mentioned.

Qualities: I pride myself in outsmarting my opponent with strategy and tactics, and I enjoy rustling people's jimmies from time to time. I have been told I am cool by my parents, so I believe this to be true.

I have mumble/ Dolby axon, and have a mic.

Thanks for considering! </TEXT>

I am versatile, I can adjust to different situations.

I am an average pvper with almost 6 maps of experience under my belt, I m very lighthearted but can be serious at times. I have mumble, and Skype. And I am a former leader of 2 factions. I can outsmart the enemy and can form tactics. I am fairly well known around the server and can be a perfect addition to any faction.

Thanks for your time,
Chaseair115 </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hey guys, I'm back, and looking for an established faction. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have many aspects that could be appealing to the faction leaders out there, I'm an average pvper . But what I lack in fighting skill I can make up for in personality and work ethic. I pride myself in outsmarting the enemy and outright pissing them off while I'm at it. I have been around since map 3 and have much experience on the server. Having lead two factions since leaving ShadowWalk map 7.

Thank you for your time, and please consider adding Chaseair115 to your faction </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am Chaseair115, but just call me Chase,I have been around since Map 3, which I lonewolfed, I can swing my share of swords at a decent speed, but thats not what i'm all about. I am smart and can think and plan on raids, and events that are thrown at me and my faction mates, whoever those may be. I have been known here and irl to be able to roll with the punches and be versatile in even the hardest of situations. I have experience in building, but not redstone, and I understand how other factions will raid, attack, etc. before they even do it. I am also known for being able to trashtalk anything, and anyone, which can be used as a tactical advantage to my faction. I have a mic and mumble, and a sense of humor. Most people on this server know me, and I appreciate whoever read this, and that you consider me for your faction! Paz! </TEXT>
