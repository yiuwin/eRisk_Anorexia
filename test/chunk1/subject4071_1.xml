	<TEXT> Our history teacher always had a very strong alcoholic haze around him. He passed out in the middle of a rant about the headmaster. He was taken away in an ambulance. We got a new history teacher. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This should answer your question.
'Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,' said Gandalf. 'He would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would be a danger, even though I promised to look after you. He thought the ring was very beautiful, and very useful at need; and if anything was wrong or queer it was himself. He said it was "growing on his mind". and he was always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame. Though he had found out that the thing needed looking after; it did not seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an odd way, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it once had been tight.' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started reading it to my daughter when she was 5 and she found it quite frightening. She is 13 now and we have read the whole series together many times. We are half way through book 2 of the Lord of the rings at the moment. 
I personally would stick to more light hearted stories for a 3 year old.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I found this quite difficult to come to terms with too. I think possibly that being treated like children and looking and feeling like children keeps them seeming immature but also with a certain amount of knowledge and intelligence that children of their age would not have.
I personally don't think that it detracts from the story, what is odd is the relationship between Jacob and his grandfathers girlfriend!
I am about to start the second book, i really need to know what happens and to me that is the sign of a good story. </TEXT>
