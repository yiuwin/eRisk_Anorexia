	<TITLE> The Making a Difference Project and the unfortunate fuzziness of rape statistics </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-27 13:09:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't really have much interest in arguing about stuff on this sub, but I am interested in statistics. One sort of infamous area of misleading presentation of statistics is rape statistics, and as there's a lot of conflicting information about this, I thought I'd talk a bit about one major study on rape reporting and conviction rates, and how data can be presented in a very misleading way when great uncertainty exists.

For the record, /u/Interversity asked me to make this post.

The Making a Difference project was run by End Violence Against Women International, a major anti-rape and anti-womens violence organization which is pretty widely respected by the anti-rape advocacy community.

Part of the project involved a study on how police reports of rape were handled and dealt with. They trained police in several cities to record data on the clearance of rape reports, categorizing them into several categories according to the eventual consequences of the rape report.

The data can be found in one of their powerpoint presentations, seen here: http://www.evawintl.org/images/uploads/BasicDataFindings_12-07-09.pdf 

The data here is quite interesting, and has been used by numerous anti-rape organizations. Indeed, some groups have gone so far as to call it the ONLY such study. This is not true  there have been numerous other studies  but it is a very interesting and informative case.

It is frequently claimed that only 2-8% of rapes reported to police are false. This is both true and false, and the fact that I said that suggests that this is actually a deeply misleading statistic. And it really is. If you look at the Wikipedia article about false reports of rape, you find wildly varying statistics, ranging from as low as 1.5% to as high as 90% in various scientific studies on the matter:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape

And indeed, if you look at the studies, they really are all over the place; theres very little agreement.

So why are these so variable? And why is the 2-8% statistic so misleading?

The problem is that what is being described as a false report of rape varies immensely from study to study. In some studies, it is defined as cases where the police categorized the report as being maliciously false. In others, it is defined as cases where the police had reason to believe no crime had occurred. In still other studies, it is defined as cases where the victim later recanted and admitted their accusation of rape had been false. Obviously, conflating all of these things isnt going to lead to the same number.

The Making a Difference study was interesting because it broke down rape reports by how the cases were closed by police  it looked at the end result of a police investigation which resulted from a victim reporting to police that they had been raped.

The categories were:

**Unfounded/false reports (i.e. the police know that the person was lying):** 7.1%

**Unfounded/baseless (i.e. "those that do not meet the elements of the offense and those that were improperly coded as a sexual assault in the first place." including cases in which a "follow-up investigation reveals either that no crime occurred or that some other type of crime was actually committed (or attempted)."):** 8.5%

**"Closed as an informational report" (when someone reports something which did happen, but which doesn't fit the definition of a sexual assault - i.e. someone reporting something that wasn't actually a crime):** 17.9%

So at this point, we've got 33.5% of reported rapes in the study. All three of these categories are, fundamentally, the categories where the reported rapes were likely untrue, though it is likely that at least some of the claims in these categories WERE true and the police simply misclassified them. However, as you can see, theyre actually split up across three different categorizations, and in one categorization  the closed as an information report category  the crime victim wasnt lying at all, they were simply confused about what rape is.

So, if you are looking for "reported rapes which weren't true", youre already looking at a baseline of roughly 33.5% - or a third of rapes which were reported which were untrue. Not all of those were necessarily "false" in the sense of being malicious lies, but they were most likely false in the sense of the accused being innocent of having committed rape or sexual assault (though, as noted, some of them probably were actually true and the police miscategorized them).

Moving on are a few major ambiguous categories:

**Suspended/inactivated (I.e. when there isn't enough evidence to say if a rape occurred and the investigation stalls out as a result without charges being filed):** 28.6%

**Exceptionally cleared (i.e. when the police are unable to proceed in arresting someone either due to the death of the perpetrator or because the person who claimed to have been raped becomes uncooperative when the police proceed in their investigation):** 17.9%

These two categories constitute nearly half of all rape reports, but as you can see, the guilt or innocence of the perpetrator is hard to determine. Rape is a notoriously difficult to prove crime, and frequently leaves little meaningful evidence behind  sex, after all, is not illegal, only non-consensual sex, and many rapes dont use force.

Consequently, many of them dont really leave much evidence.

However, not seeing any real evidence of rape is also evidence that no rape actually happened at all  surely, many of the cases where there is not even enough evidence to lead to an arrest are cases where the person was wrongfully accused, or where the victim accused the wrong person of having raped them (which in and of itself is a problem  this happens at times, and it can simultaneously result in someone being accused of a rape which actually happened, but which THEY were not guilty of, which is difficult to classify as being true or untrue).

Likewise, exceptionally cleared cases  where the investigation is dropped either because it is moot or because the victim refuses to cooperate further  are ambiguous. Did the victim stop helping because they realized that their story was coming apart? Were they intimidated into dropping the case by the person they accused? Were they simply upset by the whole thing and just wanted it to be over? It is hard to really know. Likewise, if someone is dead, there is little point in further investigation, as no prosecution can be brought.

Thus, at the end, were left with this:

**Arrested:** 20%

Note that already, were down to only 1 in 5 rape reports actually resulting in probable cause for an arrest. This does *not* mean that 20% are true or that 80% are untrue, though, as noted above. Indeed, as well see, things get cut down considerably further.

Of people who are arrested:

**Case rejected by the prosecution (i.e. the state feels that they dont think they have enough of a case to warrant trying to bring them to trial):** 33.2%. 

**Case dismissed with all charges dropped (i.e. the prosecution charges the defendant, but the charges are dropped before trial, either rejected by the judge or otherwise failing to meet the legal standards necessary to bring it to trial, or the prosecution abandoning the case because they feel that the evidence they are going to present is insufficient to result in a conviction):** 20.9%

**Case dismissed but the charges arent dropped (i.e. the state stops with the case, but thinks that the person still might have done it, so keeps the charges up even while they stop with prosecuting it):** 2.3%

So in over 50% of cases where people actually get arrested, the government doesnt end up prosecuting the person due to lack of evidence or failure to build an adequate case for conviction.

**Defendant pleads guilty:** 33.2%

Here is our first real category where a significant fraction of the people are almost certainly guilty. Here, people are pleading guilty to a very serious criminal offense. While people do occasionally plead guilty to crimes they didnt commit, the overwhelming majority of these folks probably did commit the crime.

**Case brought to trial, defendant found not guilty:** 2%

**Case brought to trial, defendant found guilty:** 5.9%

(The rest are categorized, totally helpfully, as other)

So when we finally get to the trial, only 8% of people who were actually arrested on suspicion of rape actually end up facing a judge and jury. And of those people, 1 in 4 of them are found not guilty!

If you do the math (20% * 5.9%), this works out to less than 2% of rapes reported to police result in someone being found guilty of rape in a court of law. Combined with those who plead guilty, were left with about 7.8% of rape reports which result in someone being found guilty of rape or pleading guilty to rape. These people are almost all guilty of rape, but as the Innocence Project and similar things have taught us, some of these people, too, arent guilty.

Thus, this study leaves us with:

**It is unlikely anyone was raped:** 33.5%

**We have no idea if anyone was raped:** 58.7%

**Someone was almost certainly raped:** 7.8%

As you can see, there is a massive amount of uncertainty in rape reports. You could  quite accurately  claim that this study found only 7% of rapes reported to police were false. But the problem is that implies that the other 93% of rapes reported to police were true, which is just not the case at all  false reports of rape, in this study, meant a specific thing, and that thing was not the same as untrue reports of rape. While almost all of the claims which were classified as false were likely to be untrue, as you can see from the many categories of police clearance of these cases, the likelihood of someone actually being guilty of rape if they are accused of rape varies wildly by the way in which it was dismissed. It is very unlikely that everyone whose rape case was dismissed due to lack of evidence was guilty, for instance, and likewise it is unlikely that everyone whose accuser withdrew their accusations was guilty.

But it is equally correct to note that many of these folks probably really did commit rapes, but got off because rape is a hard to prove crime, or their accuser got scared or upset or was intimidated into recanting.

Suggesting that only 7.1% of rapes are false would be like claiming that only 7.8% of people accused of rape are guilty. This is, of course, absolutely true according to this study as well, but it is also deeply misleading, as it implies that the other 92.2% of people were not guilty of rape  when in reality, it is almost certainly true that many of them in fact committed the crime, but there was simply not the evidence to convict (or, in some cases, that the victim accused the wrong person).

Complicated by all of this is the fact that studies indicate that a large percentage of people will report in crime victimization surveys that they were sexually assaulted or raped, but never reported it to the police  meaning that any conclusion we draw from reported rapes has to be taken with a heaping pile of salt, as these surveys often indicate that the majority of people who say that they were sexually assaulted did not report it to police. How would their cases be handled by the system? Thats simply something we dont (and cant) know.

A lot of people both misuse and misrepresent these statistics. As you can see from this study, in reality, we have absolutely no idea whatsoever what percentage of rapists are going free, and we have absolutely no idea how many people are accused of rapes that they did not commit. We have no realistic way of knowing, either, because of the massive uncertainty in all the cases which are dismissed for various entirely reasonable reasons which leave the question of what exactly happened open.

Anyone who claims with conviction that only 2% or 8% or whatever of rape claims are false is, at best, misleading people. We simply dont know how many rape claims are false, though as you can see from the Making a Difference study, those numbers are likely about an order of magnitude on the low side.

However, on the other hand, it is also obvious from this study that in reality, we have little idea of how many rapes are actually happening in the first place  the fact that a third of rapes that end up being reported to the police are very unlikely to have happened draws the reliability of surveys into question, and the fact that a lot of the other cases which were dismissed for other reasons were probably equally untrue suggests that the untrue rate of rape reports could be very high indeed, and that the surveys may be wildly unreliable.

But we also can see from these numbers that it is very likely there are a lot of rapists who are walking free due to lack of evidence or failure of the victim to cooperate with law enforcement after making their initial report. And the fact of the matter is that many women with solid cases are likely intimidated into not reporting rapes at all.

The reality is that rape statistics are extremely unclear and uncertain, and making firm claims about them is very hard to do. The best we can do is say that it is hard to say whether or not most claims are true or false without investigating them, and that it is likely that there are many untrue claims of rape, and many claims of rape which are true and yet which cannot be proven in a court of law. There are many people who are wrongfully accused of rape, and there are many rapists who are walking free as a result of lack of evidence against them or intimidating their victims into not pursuing their cases.

The reality is that we dont really know. And we should not pretend to do so in the face of so much uncertainty. We should always keep an open mind, and allow the evidence of a particular case to take us to the proper destination  statistics, in this case, are of little assistance. 

One final note: almost all rape studies are done on the general population. Rape in prison is prevalent, but the degree of its prevalence is unknown; some have claimed that as many rapes happen every year in Americas prisons as happen in the rest of the country combined. Unfortunately, it is hard to know the truth of this, and very few studies have been done on it  most studies like the Making a Difference study are concerned with people in the general population, not prisoners. But given the general low rate of prison prosecutions, it is very likely that there are many serial rapists in prison who continue to victimize other inmates without receiving further punishment. </TEXT>

Tennessee v Garner ruling: http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/471/1.html

Relevant Texas law: http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.9.htm

 Sec. 9.41.  PROTECTION OF ONE'S OWN PROPERTY.

 (a)  A person in lawful possession of land or tangible, movable property is justified in using force against another when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to prevent or terminate the other's trespass on the land or unlawful interference with the property.

 (b)  A person unlawfully dispossessed of land or tangible, movable property by another is justified in using force against the other when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to reenter the land or recover the property if the actor uses the force immediately or in fresh pursuit after the dispossession and:

 (1)  the actor reasonably believes the other had no claim of right when he dispossessed the actor;  or

 (2)  the other accomplished the dispossession by using force, threat, or fraud against the actor.


 Sec. 9.42.  DEADLY FORCE TO PROTECT PROPERTY.

 A person is justified in using deadly force against another to protect land or tangible, movable property:

 (1)  if he would be justified in using force against the other under Section 9.41;  and

 (2)  when and to the degree he reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary:

 (A)  to prevent the other's imminent commission of arson, burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, theft during the nighttime, or criminal mischief during the nighttime;  or

 (B)  to prevent the other who is fleeing immediately after committing burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, or theft during the nighttime from escaping with the property;  and

 (3)  he reasonably believes that:

 (A)  the land or property cannot be protected or recovered by any other means;  or

 (B)  the use of force other than deadly force to protect or recover the land or property would expose the actor or another to a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.

In particular, Sec 9.42.2(B) seems to conflict with the ruling in *Tennessee v Garner*, which disallowed law enforcement officers from using lethal force to effect an arrest of a fleeing felon unless "the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others."

While *Garner* was only concerned with law enforcement officers, it seems like it would be likely that the Supreme Court would extend this to private individuals as well, as law enforcement officers generally have a greater right to use lethal force than ordinary private citizens, especially given that the ruling in *Garner* was based on the idea that the state's interest in shooting fleeing criminals did not outweigh the criminal's interest in not dying in cases where the criminal did not present a significant threat to the community.

Am I missing something here, or is that Texas statute likely to fall if challenged? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Limits of Automation - Slavery </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-19 07:59:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are many fundamental limits of automation. An automation which costs more than a person to do the same labor isn't particularly useful, nor is an automation which requires more resources to produce than it itself produces.

But there's another important limit of automation, but one that I only rarely see discussed - slavery.

Back in the 1800s, humans had property which could perform any tasks that a person could. These were called slaves, and could perform these tasks because they were themselves people.

After numerous bloody wars and international sanctions against slave-holding countries, all countries in the world today have declared slavery illegal - people are not property.

And right now, that isn't much of an issue.

But in the future, as we create increasingly sophisticated machinery capable of ever more cognitively challenging tasks, there may come a point at which, in order to perform a task, we'd need to create something with human-level intellect - an artificial person.

And at that point, we have reached a very fundamental limit of automation, because at that point, we're no longer creating a piece of property, but a child - a person.

And you have to pay people. People have rights and autonomy.

While there are numerous movies about robots that achieve personhood, I seldom see this discussed seriously in terms of the future of automation. This may be because human-level intelligence is potentially extremely difficult to achieve using even future computing technology, but it is a real issue. Any task which cannot be performed by something of sub-human intelligence is a task which potentially can only be performed by a being with intelligence comparable to or greater than a human, which seems very likely to mean that they'd be a person - something capable of thinking for itself, of making decisions, of discharging the rights and responsibilities of a citizen, and, of course, of wanting to get paid for their labor.

This seems like a pretty big barrier to automation - beyond that point, further automation is not possible. You can make better people, but while you might be making people who are more efficient at doing work, you're still making people, who will require pay. Moreover, we are already capable of producing people, and producing people who are very good at certain tasks may not be a terribly profitable endeavor given that buying and selling people - slavery - is illegal. This is a fundamental economic limit as well.

So what do you think? How do you think this issue is likely to play out? Are there any tasks which seem particularly likely to require human-level intelligence, and thus not be possible to automate because of the "person problem"? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why Robots Don't Get Rid of Work </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-02 12:36:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It is often claimed in discussions of future technology that robots will take over most or all jobs, prices will fall, and people will be able to work less (or not at all, in many cases).

This is completely wrong, and a dangerous misunderstanding of economics.

To replace a human worker, a robot merely needs to be cheaper than them - but it doesn't necessarily need to be much cheaper. If it costs a company $9.90 an hour for robotic labor, versus $10 an hour for human labor, you're only saving 1% of your costs. Thus, it is possible for robotic labor to replace human labor without significant costs savings. This removes the possibility of lower prices - if the costs of production only fall by a small amount, then prices are unlikely to fall by more than a small amount as well.

Moreover, the cost of labor is only a portion of the cost of doing business - the costs of shipping and production, raw materials and the movements of materials from place to place, often play a large role in the final price of a product. While obviating the need for a driver or miner is helpful, you're still consuming resources in order to produce and transport things from place to place, using infrastructure, and otherwise doing things which take up resources - resources which are ultimately both limited, and which cost money.

The net result of all this is that prices do not fall to zero in an automated economy, because costs don't fall to zero. As such, the necessity for earning a wage still exists - stuff in the future society wouldn't be free.

And moreover, people would still need to work. Automation tends to push things uphill - you get rid of unskilled labor and replace it with increasingly skilled labor which is responsible for maintaining and even optimizing the automation, and keeping production running. Indeed, this is already happening in real life - factories which employ mostly skilled laborers, and yet which still produce the same amount of product. These people would still be producing useful things in exchange for goods and services, and would expect to be compensated for their time - they aren't slaves.

And why should these people produce goods for people who do nothing for them in return?

There's no good reason for this at all - indeed, they'd be better off without them, and be able to redirect their efforts into producing things which are useful for them.

So, others would need to still perform useful services as well in exchange for commodities. In the US, the service sector has taken over the economy, and this trend is likely to continue into the future - people will provide ever more sophisticated and specific services for other people.

Indeed, in many ways, this is a response to past displacement of labor - originally, 100% of people were involved in food-gathering. Today, it is closer to 2%. Then we transitioned to industry, but nowadays, industry only makes up a fraction of the economy.

At neither step did humans simply stop working - instead, they continued to work even as their greater efficiency allowed fewer people to do previously time-intensive tasks, freeing them up to take more sophisticated jobs.

In the future, this trend will simply continue - jobs will grow increasingly sophisticated over time, providing people with goods and services which were previously problematic to produce because no one had the time/resources to do it. But simply not working won't be an option, because you are, at that point, treating other people as your slaves - saying that their work is yours, without giving anything back in return.

Ultimately, economic exchanges are a form of mandatory altruism which allows people to specialize and produce things which they would otherwise be unable to produce, be that a new TV or an excellent massage. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Total Gold Gains - Discouraging? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-27 09:19:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You get 16,000 gold total from your player levels.

The stimpack you get at level 10, assuming you play 5 games per day on average, will yield about 437.5 gold (a pretty terrible deal, all told - you really shouldn't buy stimpacks, they're throwing money down a hole, and you need to play an enormous amount just for them to get you an extra day's worth of gold gains).

This means your "base gold" for just levelling to player level 40 is maybe 16500 gold. This will take roughly 40 days to accomplish.

Each character can give you a maximum of 500 + 1250 + 2500 = 4250 gold if you max out their level. Getting to 500 gold is pretty easy (600k experience) but beyond that things start getting pretty expensive. In total, to hit level 20 with a hero, you need 69,950,000 xp. For reference, this is about twice as much as you need to hit player level 40 (33,300,000 xp).

This extremely high level of experience will take ages to get to. If you earned 175k xp/game, it would take you roughly 400 games to hit hero level 20. At 5 games per day, that's 80 days. And that's assuming you don't take the time out to get those lower level gold gains from all the characters.

If we assume that, in the long run, every hero will eventually become free to play for a week, if we assumed that the full hero schedule rotated by the time you hit level 40 (which is a generous assumption, but we're living in fantasyland here), with the present cast, you're looking at picking up an additional 17,500 gold (500 * 35), assuming you played each character for pretty close to the bare minimum necessary to hit level 5.

Thus, we can assume that a player, who manages to play to level 40, and who levels every hero in the game to level 5, will accumulate a base of  34,000 gold.

Daily quest experience is 375 gold per day on average.

If you play 5 quick match games per day, you will be making about 125 gold per day, in probably something between 2 and 3 hours.

That works out to another 500 gold per day.

Thus, after 40 days of gameplay, you would have accumulated roughly 500*40 = 20,000 gold in this way.

So, a fresh level 40 player can expect to accumulate roughly 54,000 gold, assuming they played five matches every day on average for 40 days straight.

Or, to put it another way: your initial gold base is sufficient to buy five heroes that cost 10,000 gold each, and a couple of 2k gold heroes.

Assuming that blizzard comes out with a new hero once every "month" (30 days), and assuming that you can play every hero for free within a reasonable period of time, you can assume that you can earn another 500 gold per month off of that hero. Additionally, you can assume that you will earn approximately 47 additional gold per day from levelling characters to level 20, assuming that you focus on it. In reality, you will be earning 3750 gold per 80 days, with 2500 and 1250 coming in lump sums, but whatever. And in reality, you probably won't be playing the same character that much - in reality, if you played about 5 heroes roughly equally, it would take you roughly 400 days - or more than a year - for you to get that money (though, in the end, I suppose you would either way).

Note that it is actually better to level a hero to level 20 than to level multiple heroes to level 15, as you get xp faster that way.

In any case, we can thus work out how much money you're going to be making per month after the first month. And it isn't pretty.

At 500 gold per day, and 30 days per month, you're looking at 15,000 gold per month. Add the new hero to level 5 bonus of 500 gold/month and the 1400 gold or so per month you can expect from levelling heroes to super high levels (15-20), and you're looking at earning 16,900 gold per month.

Assuming that each new hero costs 15,000 gold, you would, thus, be getting about one new hero a month, with 1,900 gold left over afterwards.

Is it just me, or is that incredibly discouraging?

Even up front, I've not been buying many heroes - I'm level 15 right now, and I've done my dailies every day, and yet I've still accumulated just south of the amount of money necessary to purchase Sylvanas. And I'm very low level! In the long run, earning about as much gold as I have would require me to play 2-3 hours every night for a month, just to buy one new hero.

That seems pretty obnoxiously slow as far as gains go. I do understand that "free to play" games aren't really free to play, but that really seems excessive - even if I played the game pretty obsessively, I still wouldn't really get much ROI in-game for it.

The daily quests are, obviously, an attempt to addict people - to make them feel guilty for not playing. But it seems that the amount of stuff they're actually giving you is practically nothing for your effort. If you're forcing yourself to play for your dailies, you're basically throwing away several hours for an amount of gold which buys you about 1/20th of a 10k gold hero.

It just doesn't seem worth it to me. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> He really has no reason to lie about what happened, and very good reasons to tell the truth. All he really has to say was that Voldemort had tried to bring a prophecy to fruition by making Harry into a copy of himself as a baby and failed, and then tried again tonight and failed again.

The only thing he really needs to lie about, beyond hiding the whole "destroying the universe" claim, is Hermione's resurrection. That is easily explained by saying that Voldemort intended to rip her apart time and again in front of Harry's eyes in an attempt to drive Harry to madness, and/or suggest that Voldemort brought her back to life so he could possess her and be at Harry's side to control him.

Much fewer points of failure and much less likely to be easily contradicted by viewing it from a distance while time turnered; if they can hear what happened, Harry is screwed anyway.

Heck, he can even say that Voldemort heard a prophecy that the only way Voldemort would never die would be if Harry was utterly destroyed. It isn't even untrue.

And of course, Voldemort's insistence on Parseltongue would make it difficult if not impossible to decipher a great deal of their conversation anyway.

He's creating an extremely elaborate setup which can be easily falsified with a time-turner and a set of binoculars, and while it is possible everyone else is that stupid, Voldemort has more or less implied that the people in charge of the Aurors are remotely smart enough to check - and that would be very bad for Harry. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tools Harry has left </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-22 07:41:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, what tools does Harry have left to him?

1) Broomsticks. He has excellent innate control over broomsticks, something Voldemort had to acquire with many years of practice. Voldemort made his bones into broomsticks; it is possible that Harry might be able to command Voldemort's leg "UP!" or something similar to mess with him or possibly cause him harm or otherwise incapacitate him.

2) Magical interaction causes Voldemort to become incapacitated.

3) Legilmancy. Probably not useful against Voldemort, unless it counts as magic interacting, in which case using it against Voldemort could instantly spell a win condition simply via incapictating him.

4) Dementor summoning ritual. We know the ingredients necessary to summon Death, and we know that Harry has a knack for rituals like this. We also know that he asked for rope, and there is at least one sword in the castle which has likely been used to kill someone. Could potentially be used in such a ritual, though it seems like a bit of a waste.

5) Harry's friends who haven't shown up yet, most notably the Weasley twins, but also Neville.

6) Unnamed second transmutation, which may be Hermoine's corpse, but might be something else.

7) 1 hour of time-turner time left; if he can get his mitts on the time-turner, he can potentially do some shenanigans, though at this point he has no escape route from the final chamber; he could send a message to someone, though.

8) A rock. Sometimes, hitting your opponent in the head with a rock is good enough.

9) Less than 4 hours until he hits the present.

What else does he have?

EDIT:

10) Mastery of the Deathly Hallow: Cloak

11) The Mirror of Erised shows you your deepest desire. Draco mentioned a very long time ago that, to people like him, even if they knew that you were manipulating them using said desire, it still exerted an extremely powerful tug. This can potentially be used to Harry's advantage, should he be able to see what Voldemort wants. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What actual criminal investigations are going on in relationship with GamerGate/anti-GamerGate stuff right now?

As far as I know, Sarkeesian's death threats have been investigated, but that's the ONLY investigation of which I am aware.

Have Quinn's death threats been reported to the police or investigated by them?

Have Milo Yiannoppoulos's death threats and the syringe thing been reported to the police or investigated by them?

Have Brianna Wu's threats been reported to the police or investigated by them?

The Fine Young Capitalists, Phil Fish, Zoe Quinn, and others have claimed to have been hacked; we know that TFYC and Phil Fish's webpages were defaced and Quinn's nude photos were leaked, the source supposedly being that one of her accounts had been accessed. Were these incidents reported to the police? Is there an ongoing investigation into these incidents?

Has anyone been charged by the police in conjunction with any of these incidents? Are there even any suspects presently being pursued?

I have heard absolutely nothing about any investigations other than the one into the death threats against Sarkeesian. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously. I always searched by metascore. This makes it significantly more of a pain for me to look through the daily specials, which makes it much less likely that I will bother to do so. Sorting by user ratings is nice, but I want to be able to sort by metascore, too.

	<TEXT> Seriously. There's a lot of games which are vaguely interesting but I'm not willing to pay their current price on because they may or may not be good. Being able to mark something so that I get renotified when it price drops would be nice.

Yes, I know there is the wishlist, but that gets used by people to figure out what to buy you, while these are random "eh, maybe" games. There's no real "eh, maybe" option right now. </TEXT>
