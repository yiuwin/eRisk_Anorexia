	<TEXT> Exactly.

Some artists tend to adopt an obscurantist tendency by hiding topics from the clear sight, making the artwork appreciation a matter of initiation in some kind of knowledge; by this way, it is possible to approach biased criticism or to avoid strict censorship, for instance.

But it can go much further, as you noticed, and obscurantism can be turned into personalism; [Fernando Pessoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Pessoa) is a good example of that in the means of poetry.

But there is a problem related with expectancy that makes us hope that a general name could be trully related with a specific thing, but, when we start to inquiry ourselves about the "whys", we realize it is founded on nothing more than ideas we tend to associate together; [Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley) and [Hume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume) are good references.

About origins and source, I could not agree more with you as sometimes it can even becomes embarrassing because you appreciate the work and try to dialogue about it and the deepest aspect of the artwork is that it was "inspired" by a random internet picture, delivering more technic than art; also it is always interesting to discuss the meaning of an artwork, both in the person of the artist or of the admirer, so, it is a loss of chance not to do it before there is no more "witnesses" alive.

One last thing, the photography is another reason for painting have abandoned the way of depicting the material realism of nature as it appears because it would become obsolete otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my own experience, I tend to use geometrical shapes in order to explain basic mathematical notions.

So, in screens that you could find emptyness, actually, I try to demonstrate what is the meaning of the [power of two as a growing rate](https://quaestio.org/constante/), what is to see [10.000 points at once in a painting in which the most proeminent color is not used at all](https://quaestio.org/ekatommyria/) or even how to depict [a green illuminated screen with only 51% percent of green at the same time I try to demonstrate what is the effect of an odd number](https://quaestio.org/transparente/).

I even use videos to make things like [a one minute digital hourglass that serves to make reference on the thought about how the time passes](https://quaestio.org/horologium/) and [a structural allusion to meditation](https://quaestio.org/%CE%B1%CE%B5%CE%B7%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%89/).

I mean, some works could seem vague at first sight, but one or another concept are there hidden and the vagueness is proposital, at least, in my case.

And a question I have for you: what is the value of a realistic painting of a wild animal if the animal did not pose in front of the artist?

Sometimes, material objects are just not interesting and we can not forget a real thing in a painting is really never a real thing, meaning that it is not more concrete than an abstraction.

I guess the most valuable interest in painting is related with philosophy of mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The weirdest experience with Chop I had was reported [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/40d8ly/need_someone_to_look_and_see_if_there_is_a/cyz5rgj):

 Something weird, probably a glitch, happened when Franklin was returning home after some time and as well as he was getting to the hood, Chop ran away and began to circulate the indoor dome; the strange thing is that in the last hangout with Lamar, they talked about how Chop is able or not to work with them.

 When you restart, pay attention to one dialogue where Franklin and Lamar talk about Chop and observe if he runs again in the direction of the dome after this conversation.
It was very weird because Franklin did not even get home and Chop appeared running in the street; following him, I circulate the dome, Maze Bank Arena, but, in a car, two stars popped up and he was lost after some time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That would be awesome: it might take a while until then, but I will surely record about you by the time it is ready to be tested, my friend!

And it was my curiosity in that feature also because it does not make so much sense only the green $-alike disappearing; another thing, I do not know if it is noticeable in the clip, but it is already visible, then it fades out and it fades in again (it only happens while between two light poles); maybe it has something to do with the bridge and, in this case, we could not do much anyway, but it remembers how the billboard and the ghost seems to work, by fading in or out accordingly with the distance the character is (in these cases, there is other triggers too).

This makes me think if we are not making important things fade out because of some unaware mistakes we make in the way or even if something could fade in if we proceed properly somehow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for the consideration, my friend!

Exactly: I have some experience with easy to use platforms and have some pilot games for my girlfriend's school, but I am planning to make an entire PC game now, but in a retro style.

And you are very right, space and time are the main triggers and even a third aspect that seems to conjunct the two, like, in which part of the story it is, what could be checked like a completion status you have metioned.

I really do not know how to check these kind of informations in the game files by now, but someone could help us; at least by memory, I know /u/acuratech31 and /u/Maniak_Of_Copy are experienced on it.

And a question: have you ever seen this [sequence](http://imgur.com/cOtMfPk) happening in your experience?

I think it is just a glitch, but it is very selective and it works like the "invisible spawn" that the ghost and Capolavoro use. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess our point has validity and it is good to know I am not the only one thinking in such way.

I am almost in the end of my current playthrough and I am still planning to do that; anyway, I am believing Capolavoro's is triggered by the end of the game because I pass by it everytime I end a mission and it is never there.

I am also curious about the ghost spawn and in similar invisible spawns because, for instance, the jet can be not landed at Zancudo, but, if you ignore that and just advance to take it, it magically appears, just like the ghost suddenly appear and disappear.

The only problem is that my playthrough is kind of stuck since I became addicted in flying jets online and started the preparations to develop a simple game. </TEXT>

For example, I am looking for the reason Capolavoro's billboard changes because, in my logic, by knowing how it works we could search for things that work in this way, I mean, the way unlockables are triggered and what triggers them.

But as I do not have experience with the files of this game, I am planning to check exactly what makes things like this happen and, then, I will bring it here for a discussion. </TEXT>

I do not know if this information is relevant, but it could help you to think about it somehow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly, my friend!

The similarities goes till the two edges of the cut orange logo, near where the letters *r* and *o* of *radio* is: you could draw the left section of the hippy camp easily by the countour of the orange logo.

Another interesting thing of it is the colors orange and blue in display, suggesting Trevor and Michael; by my two similarities' posts, I tought Michael was needed for the landslide areas because it is near Madrazo's and because of the presence of its colored beer at the Cement's and Trevor was needed for Mirror Park because of the hipster rampage and billboards around a fast-food drive-thru: the logo colors match; but there is the presence of the number 88.9, as the code for the radio in itself, that adds confusion to the meaning of the blue logo.

The street lights path is interesting, but I agree with you; lately, I have been taking a lot of pictures online and a lot of suggestive things were noticed in such way that sometimes completely paradoxal theories could be made, using the same object/subject to mean different things in each one:

* [three paitings](http://imgur.com/elYTR3z) inside Floyd's apartment and my house online;
* [The Shoulder Of Orion II](http://imgur.com/yM002lu);
* [Franklin's bike parked at Michael's house](http://imgur.com/bAk4Z0V) (different plate and color);
* [spade shape](http://imgur.com/BiONgWE);
* [mural](http://imgur.com/4ZlqIgU) related somehow;
* a [X in a square](http://imgur.com/9CSc6l1);
* misplaced [south](http://imgur.com/k5JXhKV) at northwest (Paleto Bay);
* [tractors prohibited on Chiliad](http://imgur.com/w4RCMj6);

And, even about the landslide barriers, I collected some new content:

* [Vinewoodland...slide](http://imgur.com/GGlB9un);
* [one](http://imgur.com/2YKwaCx) and [two](http://imgur.com/ybiUH1P) amphitheaters are sectioned just like the landslide barries and a part of the Hippy Camp (also, amphitheaters and landslide barriers, all at the same region);
* a question that popped up is: has anyone already gone to the Life Invader event during the mission?

But, my friend, I collect all this material and, to be honest, I do not know what they could mean or how they could be useful for getting the jetpack. </TEXT>

Never noticed that before and it is a very deep detail.

 V on the side of the 3 Heists or red X's.

If you pick that stock market guy (random event) with Trevor, it is interesting to note that Trevor says his name is "Trevor with three Vs"; also, in the way, you will probably pass by that apartment block with Vs in three sides.

 "mirror at the bottom of the lake"

I simply combined *children* with *childish* and "judge others" with the election aspect of altruism in my interpretation.

And I understand what you are saying about the cults because I even think we should [never trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/3yf44u/dr_friedlander_and_karmatic_options/cyfzv4u) a lot of characters and situations of the game, if it was not just a game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The promisse about the protest made me to perform it quickly at the first time for the curiosity.

In my recent playthrough, I was saving the last one (Franklin's) for later as well as a lot of other side missions, but Barry is refusing to answer already, before doing the "mission".

I would just try to do this at 19:00, when there is always [a firetruck in front of the city hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/45fn2k/gta_v_fire_crew_spawn_town_hall_1900/).

It is also curious to relate this last mission from Barry with Children of the Mountain's unique NCP because, if instead of going to the most known city hall, we went to another one, Franklin would eventually find a friendly face. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You do not need to thank me, my friend!

Anyway, have you thought about anything that could be done with this information?

I only thought about doing one event after the other until now. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Black Cellphones clues in the storyline </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-27 21:57:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Well, in a new playthrough, started after the acknowledgement of the new number, I tried to pay attention to references about the features of the phone (among other things) and I have separated the following:

* in the [Prologue](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Prologue), one of the first commands you make as Michael is to detonate a bomb with an old cellphone which only works for that; if you drop the phone and pick it up again it still only works for to trigger the explosion;

* in [Friend Request](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Friend_Request), the goal of Lester is to explode the head of [Jay Norris](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Jay_Norris) by calling to a switched prototype of the new line of phones of [Life Invader](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Lifeinvader), a system that can be installed over the operational systems of other brands; it is interesting that in another mission, [The Hotel Assassination](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/The_Hotel_Assassination), Lester tells Franklin about the case and relates Jay Norris with a messiah-like, when they are close to a pier; killing the messiah cosplay, ([Jesse](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Jesse_(soapboxer)), changes his face model;

* in ["Grass Roots - The Drag"](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Grass_Roots#Grass_Roots_-_The_Drag), when Franklin finds the broken car in the [Rogers Salvage and Scraps](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Rogers_Salvage_and_Scrap), Barry calls him and the first thing he says surprised is: "who change my ringtone"; he also mention something like "ignite the fight" or "ignite the fire"; if you take some time before getting the car, he calls Franklin again; in other dialogues, he mentions the satellite dishes and, later in the game, after completing his missions, he is affraid of talking on the phone. In the place, you find a gas tank with a graffiti saying ["put a red herring in it"](http://imgur.com/jDzYMNV), a broken war tank and, in the mission, it has a blue Albany Emperor parked waiting for Franklin; inside the car he can not pick up the cellphone, but, [if he picks up before entering the car, it works normally](http://imgur.com/153R74X). The Wikia mentions that "alternatively, the player can use a Cargobob to hook the car" and, also, it says that "the center's telephone number is shown to be 555-0069" and calling it redirects to a "number unavailable' tone" (I did not notice these facts while playing, so I did not try to do these things). When he talked about the ringtone, I soon tried to change the phone by calling the 1-999-367-3767, called everyone, specially Michael and Trevor (occupied) and Tonya (tow truck) and Lamar (Albany Emperor) and Barry, but nothing happened; the name of the car, Emperor, is one of the things people associated during the discussion about the meaning of the number being EMP-DROP or EMP-EROR; by the way, this car makes me to remember of a painting of Oeuvre Gallery which depicts [a blue car and a "BANG" onomatopoeia](http://i.imgur.com/jgYHTk8);

* in [The Merryweather Heist](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/The_Merryweather_Heist), when choosing the Freight option, Franklin uses the phone to detonate the C4s planted in the ship by Michael; I tried to call the number before the explosion, but not different happened;

* the explosion after the call causes [fire](http://imgur.com/QitF2e8) normally;

* on PC, the brand of Franklin's phone is [BitterSweet](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/BitterSweet);

* the number of Franklin's house given by Lester is 3671, key numbers for the Black Cellphones (/u/Sparramadux);

* billboards of the Drone operational system depicts a black cellpone and claims that ["this is the drone you've been looking for"](https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/416l3u/is_the_black_cellphone_related_with_the_drone/); this billboard always has the same image repeated front and back as we can see: [Capital Boulevard](http://imgur.com/u9HaFG7)/[La Mesa](http://imgur.com/UShnJPW), [Olympic Freeway](http://imgur.com/bY61py3)/[Little Seoul](http://imgur.com/BCqxavd) and [Milton Road](http://imgur.com/ukOddDG)/[West Vinewood](http://imgur.com/EKhZNQu), so far;

* on the billboard of Drone operational system, it is written: "the calls do not work while Chatterbot is on Drone 'Trasmute' mode" (/u/Serbian_Fantom);

* inside Lester's house, there are posters of Facade and Drone operational systems (/u/moondogg212);

* Lamar possesses an Albany Emperor for a while in the storyline (/u/Vurtne26);

* [this](http://imgur.com/s39gP46) texture seems to have some knowledge about the number.

If any referece is noticed later in the game, I update this post and I ask you to comment with references and experiences as well. </TEXT>
