	<TEXT> I'm looking for something along the lines of an eVic VT mini, but with the power of an 80 watt device. I really like this temperature with my tanks, but most of the mods that carry it are big in the pocket or pretty heavy etc.

Anyone know of any good 80 watt mini mods? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Huge opportunity missed, yet again. This time with Impractical Jokers. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-08 05:13:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just a quick rant about something I noticed on the show this morning.

I'm sure opinions will be varied here, but the show that Impractical Jokers put on, in my opinion, is pretty funny / entertaining. That's sort of besides the point though.

The point is that these are 4 guys who have been on the NYC improv / comedy scene for years and years, and they created an entire successful show based on ripping on each other, putting each other in awkward situations, selling each other out, and busting each others chops. One of the members even roasted Big Jay at the Roast of Big Jay Oakerson.

This could have been a killer combo (them and the show) if they had accessed the "real" side of the Impractical Jokers but instead, the entire interview the Impractical Joker guys were using that tone of voice that they'd use on a morning zoo station. There was no real connection made, no effort to make that connection.

At one point, one of the Impractical Joker guys dropped an F bomb, quickly corrected himself and re-said the sentence without the F-bomb. No one even corrected him and told him it's ok to say in the studio, which is something O A (especially A) would do that would usually instantly loosen someone up.

TL;DR The Impractical Joker guys have a whole "act" that is based on ripping on each other and forcing each other into awkward situations, they have a perfect sense of humor for what this show *used* to be, but instead of bringing that side out of them, it just ended up being a typical morning radio interview no different than something you'd hear them do on Cosmopolitan Radio or some shitty station like that. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I did the math, and I'm vaping around 10mL of juice per day. Think I am getting pretty addicted to vaping in particular. Is this amount a lot? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-06 05:49:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I noticed that I often refill my Atlantis 2 twice per day, The third fill I usually don't finish but I added that up and I believe that's almost 10mL of juice per day.

I noticed that when I don't have my vaporizer when I'm going somewhere I get annoyed that I don't have it, even if I just go out for an hour or two.

Sometimes I think to myself that I don't even really like the feeling of nicotine very much, it just makes me dizzy and makes my stomach queezy. I don't know why I vape so much, I've tried to switch to 0mg juices but the whole thing feels so pointless at 0mg for some reason. The reason I vape is because it's like this itch I've developed in my mind that I want to scratch all the time.

I've been vaping for about 1 year now, I never smoked cigarettes before I started vaping but I did start smoking mini cigars as an excuse to make a 5 minute escape from my chaotic workplace environment. I did that for about 6 months before I switched over to this, that was about a year and a half ago.

So I guess the ***TL;DR*** is that I'm wondering if this is a lot of juice in a day, if anyone else experiences similar urges etc throughout their day, or if anyone has experience with it in the past and has some tips on cutting down and eventually getting it down to a 3-4 times per day and that's it type of thing, as opposed to heading to fog town every opportunity I get.

edit: Thanks everyone for the great feedback very much appreciated, always proves to be the right place to come with a question </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The only interesting thing Opie and Anthony can do at this point would be to reconcile their differences. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-05 06:04:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think both shows are getting really stale really fast. It depends on who you ask, some people think these shows are "picking up the pace" or "you should see what they've been doing lately" but mostly it's the same shit people have been saying since last winter and it's pretty much been business as usual on both shows since then. 

Business as usual is  getting really boring though. If you read this forum, it seems like we are forced to the point where the only entertainment value that can be derived from these shows is to listen to them and then trash them on here.

I think the only wrench left to throw into the gears is for Opie to appear on Anthony's show, or for some kind of special podcast deal or something to go down where they reconcile. It'd be the only thing left that can breathe life into these talk shows, which both look like figurative sinking ships at the moment.

I mostly doubt it will happen, but it does seem like olive branches have been extended with little side-comments and things O/A have been saying, like Anthony (half-assedly) defending Opie's cake stomping video (saying 'really now how far are you going to go back to try and trash the guy'). 

If Opie could ever man up and go on Anthony's show and hash this out it would be the one piece of footage that could bring tons of people back to see. No homeless shopping spree, jocktober clip, or special guest appearance is going to do it anymore. Reconciling is all that's left. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If 1oz of Kratom is considered illegal in Thailand, how are we getting Kratom from Thailand? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-01 20:15:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I found this from this article:

The Kratom Act, passed in 1943, makes planting the kratom tree in Thailand illegal while existing trees can be cut down. Many of the poorer classes in southern Thailand have continued to pick and use the leaves that continue to grow in the jungles of the southern provinces. Leaves may be sold illegally to other parts of Thailand but a majority of workers use them for their own personal use. 

In 1979 kratom was included in the Thai Narcotics Act along with cannabis and mushrooms, reducing sentences and punishments from those guilty under the act. An increase in the number of arrests and seizures related to kratom were reported at the beginning of the 21st century. Around this time kratom was rising in popularity as stronger narcotic cocktail from boiling the leaves and adding cough syrup, Coco-Cola and ice. The drink puts users in a sleepy stupor and the low price-20 leaves, which can make several cocktails-cost the equivalent of US$3.

http://www.thailawforum.com/kratom-legal-in-the-us-but-illegal-in-thailand/

So are these farmers just using the same trees that have been there for years? Are these "Thai" Kratom trees, just the seeds are brought into other countries where it's legal to farm it? Or are we partaking in some sort of black market here? If so, I kinda wonder where our money is eventually going! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Quick review on Fresh-Kratom's new Yellow Vietnam strain </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-29 08:10:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I decided to try out something different, I saw this was available and had never heard of it before so I figured why not? Ordered some, I'm about 3 hours into taking 2 teaspoons and would like to share my findings with you.

This is a very different kratom than I've taken. It's not like a white, and it's not like a red. It's not even really much like a green.

When I have whites, I get relaxed but way more alert, talkative, feel more vibrant etc. Greens make me more focused, very relaxed but not sleepy. Reds make my body feel really chilled out, I get more relaxed and easy-going, I feel more "warm" as does the world around. 

But this one... this is just pure chill. There isn't really any euphoria or upbeat mood. I don't feel tired. My body doesn't have too intense of any sort of opiate-like feeling, even though there is a definite sense of relaxation and I feel more comfortably "sunken" into my chair in a way.

This one feels more like a benzodiazepine, it feels like valium without the cloudiness. My words and thoughts aren't any more fluid than normal but I just have an overall sense of relaxation. It's not a happy-go-lucky, giddy relaxation feeling that a red can sometimes bring out at all.

I think this Kratom definitely has a place, you just have to find how it could benefit a certain instance of your life. For example, if I was a bouncer at a bar, I would take this kratom often. It can help to keep focused, level headed, and patient with people. I also wouldn't be worried that it would affect my motor skills in any way if something were to go down. 

If I had a cashiering job, manufacturing job, or something really repetitive, this would definitely be a staple in my inventory because the mellow relaxation can make those tasks a lot easier.

I'm not sure I *love* this strain. If I want to focus on my computer and make some music etc, I often take a green. If I'm going out about my day or going to work etc, I take a white. When I just want to chill, watch a movie or play video games, or if I feel too jittery to sleep, I might take a red. This one doesn't really fit into any areas of my life where I would want it.

If you want a kratom that sort of feels like a hybrid of all three I mentioned above, give this one a test. It might fit into something like that. 

Would definitely love to hear anyone else's thoughts on Yellow Vietnam if you've tried too!

TL;DR -- It's not a very upbeat, happy-go-lucky feeling, more like a very relaxed, patient, mellow feeling. Not as much body relaxation as red, not as much increase of focus like green does for me. It's an interesting strain that could definitely fit into a few activities or things people do, but it's a case-by-case basis whether or not it might work for someone IMO. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently installed Windows 10 through Apple Bootcamp but it came with almost no drivers. I manually installed nVidia drivers, motherboard drivers, Wi-Fi drivers, other stuff seems to be working well and I cleared up a few small missing pieces with some "DrivetheLife" software which worked pretty well.. but I can't figure out the audio drivers!

Here is what I've tried:

* Attempted to manually install Cirrus_Logic drivers, claims that my High Definition Audio Driver is more up to date than the Cirrus Logic drivers.
* Tried uninstalling the stock High Definition Audio Driver and restarted so that Windows installs the driver manually -- didn't work
* Tried installing Realtek Audio Drivers from an .exe installation file -- didn't work
* Tried playing with the 24 bit, 16 bit, 44.1kHz type settings, none of them outputted the test tone or seemed to work.


I can see the audio is working when I click "Playback Devices" (the green bars go up and down when I play a YouTube video etc.) but it's not outputting to my speakers or to the headphone jack.

If anyone has a suggestion or ran into similar problems, any feedback is good at this point for me </TEXT>

If anyone is skilled and would like to get creative I could use some help. It just needs to say "Echoes and Ghosts" and the album title is "Decay Theory" in any position / style that you feel is artistically suitable. 

Here is the image, and here is an example of one that I made that looks kinda weak.

For the whole thing -- just a flat $60 through Paypal -- free shipping. 

If you feel more secure doing it through eBay etc. I'd be happy to do so, not sure if we can make a private sale but if not I'll throw a link to you in e-mail right after making the sale and we can go from there. Either way works for me.

All games included are in good condition. None of them are perfect, most are originals that I've owned for 10+ years but about a month ago I had an XBOX binge fest (which caused the old machine to die) and every single game worked swimmingly.

Here is the list:

	<DATE> 2015-09-22 09:07:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The song is a little corny but I have the remnants of it stuck in my head and I'm dying to find it, I don't know enough about it to place it though but heres what I know:

* The song is called something like "Mr. *name*" or "Senor *name*" it's named after the drug boss that it's about.

* The music video starts out with one of the rappers answering his phone in the hood and someone says "He wants to see you" and then he goes to see him

* I think they say "coc-a-ina" a few times in the song, I think in the hook

* The hook is something very vaguely like "Mr. *name* Mr. *name* // he is my main guy // he gets the best // co-ca-ina"

I remember seeing this song and music video late one night while I was staying at this beach rental condo in North Carolina on one of those local rap shows earlier this May, but the music video was definitely a pretty high production value and I'm willing to bet it's bigger than just around NC.

If anyone can put a finger on what song it might be or has any guesses feel free to throw them in, thanks a ton in advance if someone knows what it is! </TEXT>

I'm kind of assuming it's a hardware damage that is unfixable, but I really do not have the budget for a new laptop and I like this one a lot. 

If anyone out there does computer repairs, how much does something like this generally run? Do most people just buy a new laptop instead?

I don't remember dropping or slamming my bag, but one day I took it out, turned it on, and a few of these lines appeared.

After a few weeks it's thickened out to what you see here but seems to have stopped. They are opaque white lines, nothing can go over them in any way (windows, 3D / DirectX, movies/photos etc.) </TEXT>

[NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/arts/television/steve-rannazzisi-comedian-who-told-of-9-11-escape-admits-he-lied.html) // [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34279955) // [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/16/entertainment/steve-rannazzisi-911-apology-feat/) // [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/17/the-psychology-of-why-people-like-steve-rannazzisi-lie-about-having-survived-911/)

* Here is one of the most blatant occurrences of him telling the story, on the [Marc Maron Podcast at about 24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cNJG56A3lg t=24m33s)

* Telling it on a [Pauly Shore show at 1m20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLax2I0Tt0w t=1m20s)

* [Dodgy version of the story](https://soundcloud.com/ewradio/steve-rannazzisi-talks-about-his-911-experience-on-ew-radio-sirius-xm) on an Entertainment Weekly podcast




According to what I've been reading, everything from the job at Merrill Lynch and beyond is a complete lie and fabrication, he was never employed at Merrill Lynch who did not even have offices in the 2nd tower, and he was not in the towers or anything.

Was recently hired for an ad campaign with Buffalo Wild Wings, and was promptly dropped after this came out... lucky for FX The League is in their last season, he is one of the main characters on that show.

	<TEXT> Things that typically a casual coffee drinker might like. It can be anything really that you think some of the coffee elitists would shake their head at but you can't help but like it anyways.

Mine is coffee mate powdered fat free creamer. I freaking love some fat free coffee mate creamer. It's so delicious, makes my coffee so thick and frothy, I go through it like nobody's business. I prefer it to real cream tenfold, I'd rather drink coffee black without creamer. Mmmm. Even the Coffee Mate cream I think tastes amazing in coffee, gotta be honest.

So if you're more of a hobbyist/experienced coffee drinker or consider yourself somewhat of a connoisseur, what are some (if any) of your guilty pleasures of coffee drinking? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you've never heard of the show it's a hidden camera show where they use actors to create 'scenes' in public and see how random passersby  interact with the actors, then the host comes in to ask questions afterwards.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime:_What_Would_You_Do%3F) is the Wikipedia of the show for a quick rundown of what it's about, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDanZpek5iM) is a quick example of a scenario. 

IMO it's a really interesting and entertaining show, sometimes it gives you so much hope for humanity while sometimes it can really disappoint. I get lost in it on YouTube for hours so I was hoping anyone else who gets sucked into this vortex has some good parts to share :D </TEXT>

	<TITLE> IJW: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-11 08:59:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Had no idea this was a sequel. I think I was lost near the beginning, watching the apes speak to each other in sign language, and seeing some relationships between characters that I didn't understand (Koba and Caesar and Caesar's family, not sure if this was continued from the last one).

Overall the movie was very well written. There were so many twists and turns, lots of various dynamics that all came to a boil at the same time which created a really exciting second half of the movie, every time I thought I knew what was coming next they threw a wrench into the gears.

Visually the movie was beautiful. There were a few parts where it was very clearly CGI, and due to the heavy rains, lightning etc. for some reason a couple parts caught my eye as being extremely fake and not very modern-looking like Avatar or other heavy-CGI movies. However when you are making an entire movie so dependent on it I am totally willing to give those parts a pass.

Still though, the scenery, the usage of colors and the cinematography was really satisfying. There's a part where you see this gas station in the middle of the jungle, and I won't give out any spoilers, but the color scheme just looked lovely, I was enjoying that a lot.

I had to forgive some parts of the plot that seemed a little absurd to me.  Overall though if you suspend your disbelief and just enjoy it for what it is, which is essentially a science fiction action movie, it was really entertaining and enjoyable. I'm excited to see the next movie in the series and I'll probably go back to check out the first one that came out in 2011 too! What did you guys think? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-08-28 13:59:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok guys, I am an electronic music maker, I don't have a label or anything but I want to create my own YouTube videos that are sort of similar to what these labels are making. I'll show you some examples below of things I'm trying to learn how to do. I have some ideas on how to give my own videos a unique touch to the concept, but first I have to learn the basics.

I haven't edited videos since college, but the last program I used was Video Vegas / SONY Vegas. Now I'm on a Mac though. I have iMovie but I'm assuming that I'll need some other more professional software, and maybe some plugins to do this.

Here are the type of things I'm going for:

* This is a pretty basic one that would be cool to learn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY0TP5XRIG8 it's basically just an audio equalizer with a moving background and their logo.

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjGFDngVSrE This is a more 'advanced' looking version of the previous one. I'm guessing they sort of blended the equalizer into the white text, morphed the look of it and changed around some settings involving when it appears and when it doesn't?

* This one is a super advanced looking version of the previous two. Can anyone break this down? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCHivjWsSr0

* Was looking to figure this one out too if someone can explain : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcXMfil6Xoo t=3m06s

If anyone has any good places for tutorials on this type of project that would work great too. I'm pretty new to this sort of thing but I usually pick things up pretty quick so I'm ready to learn. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tip: One way to tame the wild, treacherous beast that is your Sylenth1 Preset Banks folder </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-26 08:29:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So if you're like me, you have well over 500 preset banks for Sylenth1. They're pretty easy to come by and I'm always clicking like on some Facebook group or throwing down an alt email for a new free pack, free promotional pack, and/or any other way you can get tons of banks. I've even thrown down on a couple that sounded awesome, I find Sylenth1 incredibly easy to tweak to my liking, so it's worth it just for the education value. Who wouldn't want a massive library of sounds to play around with and be inspired by? So again if you're like me, we scoop them all up, the more the better. Pretty soon that Presets folder is looking hella stacked.

The problem is when you actually want to make music, you press "Load Bank" and an endless list of various names, all way too long with words like Electrifying, SynthmasteRs, Ninja Army etc come at you, and the actual genre/ type of Soundbank it is will be tough to distinguish -- with a word like "Trance" or "Progressive" peppered in there halfway through the title.

So here's one way you can quickly chop down that Presets folder into something more manageable to browse. This might not be preferable to everyone, and it's just a simple little idea, but figured why not pass it along:

* **You use the "Search" bar in your folder (Windows or Mac) to search the folder. Then you create a folder and place all of the results in it.**

I will put it into an example to show how it might save you some time when you're browsing presets in a session.

 Let's say you're making a House song. You have Shocking House, Animal House Bank, Electrifying House Vol. III, Vandalism House etc. all over the fucking place in this folder. You probably have a ton more that you're missing while you scroll through to get to the same old ones you always use because those are the ones you remember that work for House. 

So -- type House into your search bar.

Now all of your packs that have House in the title will show up as search results. Just make a new folder really quick, call it House, drag and drop, and voila! You have a whole library of House banks instead of scrolling through to find them. It's not a full-proof method, and you might not swoop up every house pack you have in one go, but as you narrow things off and create folders, you can do some more manageable manual sorting. 

Then do the same for Trap, etc.

You can also do this however you want -- instead of using specific genres you can use companies who make packs, like just type in Vandalism and all of their packs will show up.

**NOTE:** A lot of these packs will have a word like "Trance" but it will be written like this: 

    SynthGhOsT_Trance_vol1.fxb

So if you want to get a clean sweep, make sure to set your search to find "Any" so it just searches for the string of letters and it will pick up these packs too.

Maybe this will help someone out, figured I'd write it up, mostly because I'm waiting for the new Logic Pro X to finish up DLing and I'm on a new prescription of adderall so I keep doing shit like this lately. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-08-25 20:10:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a French Press that I use pretty often and I love it. I buy espresso roast and make some strong ass coffee for when I really want a clean buzzzzzz because damn a cup or two of that stuff and I'm zipping around the house getting more than I need done, and I'm a longtime daily caffeine user. It also tastes so incredibly dense, hearty, complex, such a deep coffee taste I can hardly describe that is worth so much more than any basic bunn machine can offer me.

However I was looking into the AeroPress lately, mostly because of what I've heard on this subreddit about it. I'm not sure if it will be that much superior to my French Press, but figured I'd ask if anyone has experience owning both etc. and what their thoughts are on AeroPress vs. French Press. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [H] have a perfectly functional Firefly vaporizer in good condition -- complete with AC adapter and an external battery charger. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-25 17:43:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm selling my Firefly vaporizer. I love the thing, it's awesome, but it's a combinations of reasons to sell -- I need money right now and frankly the weed around here sucks lately, so I can't really enjoy this thing, and getting more into wax right now. So I figure there is someone out there who wants to vaporize flowers and could enjoy this fine piece of hardware more than I can.

The only issue with it is there is some wear and tear on the cover plate. You can buy cover plates from Firefly's website in case you want a different one but it's really not too noticeable or ruins the experience in any way. I will clean out the inside all nicely but you might want to remove the bottom plate and put a new pipescreen in there (not necessary to do at all though).

with all accessories included, and noting the slight dent on the cover plate -- **I'd ask for $140** -- 50% of the cost of retail ($250 + $30 external charger). 

I would be happy to do the transaction through a website like eBay etc. to make the transaction more secure for both of us too. I'd just make a quick auction for a flower vaporizer and you could swoop it up, they'll never know what hit em.

**NOTE:** I have an extra battery that I ordered from them but it never worked right for me. It would charge up but still act like it was dead. I didn't add in any extra cost for it but I'll send it along anyways, maybe it will work magically some day or maybe you can open up a service ticket with Firefly and just say you 'lost the receipt' or something, lol. It's a $30 value although you have to fidget with it to get it right so it's more of a hassle than it's worth, still might be helpful in a pinch and it's free along with it

	<TITLE> I've been asked to make a theme for a radio show on a country music station. I've never made anything country before. Working in Logic Pro X. Would love any tips   tricks for composing country, suggestions on instrument choices, or any insight you guys have to offer. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-23 22:20:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It needs to be about 1 minute long, it doesn't need vocals because clips from the show and all that radio commercial production type stuff is going to be thrown over it. It just needs to be quick, upbeat, catchy.

* I was thinking of working in C because playing around fingerpicking with C / G / F ) seems to give me a good country sound. If you have any suggestions for different keys for country / folk I'd love to hear them. 

* I have a few Kontakt libraries that have some country-ish sounds to them, and Guitar Rig 5 has good country guitar amps too, but I need to really fill the sound out with nice bass and arrange some country drums, and if anyone has experience working with country in Logic or any other VSTs has any suggestions on this it'd be great to hear. 

* What types of organs or keys are usually used in country? I figured it's usually sort of a honkey tonk piano sound or maybe a Hammond, but I've never really looked deep into country keys.

Other than that, I've just been listening to tons of Top 40 country from the past few months and few years, trying to get a feel for what's fresh lately. Any suggestions on what's popping in country music lately, especially with the youth or college kids would be solid.

Thanks in advance if anyone has some insight to lend. Figured that there's such a wide range of people here with a huge bank of collective knowledge so it would be beneficial to reach out. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can anyone find the Jim Norton clip where he talks about how celebrities and comedians often come from bullied backgrounds, or didn't get any attention, so when they become famous they do it so everyone will love them and they can shun everyone away? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-23 20:21:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know I probably just butchered the original message, I haven't heard it in a long time. However it's something I have thought about time and time again and I think it's one of the most profound things Jimmy Norton ever said and one of the most thought provoking things ever said on the show. It was a really broad stroke but it's scary how accurate it seems to be as a theory.

Jimmy says all the time how comedians come from backgrounds where they always were hungry for attention but needed a creative way to get it, or wanted to avoid getting beaten up and wanted to be cool so they found a way to do it. However this particular time he went deeper into it and described how they treat the fame and success and why they react the way they do to it.

I notice this with tons of musicians but especially Kanye West. I think he described Kanye to a T. Now Kanye West has reached a boiling point of fame, and he has only dropped into the shadows even more. He does no press, no interviews, very little twittering about anything other than day-to-day stuff, and his hints about his albums etc. are extremely cryptic. I think Jim Norton described Kanye West perfectly and also many other celebrities and stars and the deepest part of the psyche / what keeps them striving for fame.

**TL;DR** There was one time or a few times that Jim Norton described how many comedians and celebrities come up from their childhood and what drives them to try and obtain fame, but then how they turn away from those who love them like others did to them in the past. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, so let's say you have 2 PCs at your house, one is connected to a side monitor and the other is connected to your main monitor.

...or maybe you use a main PC and you also have one connected to a TV that you like to watch stuff like movies, YouTube clips etc from.

----------------------------------------


So you're on your main PC, browsing reddit, or the internet, and you find a YouTube video you want to watch.. but you want to watch it on your second PC.

**Here is one way** that you can save yourself the hassle of going to your second PC, re-typing in the link, searching for similar terms to the title, etc. -- set your browser to have a Bookmarks tab for your [Watch History](https://www.youtube.com/feed/history).

When you are signed into the same YouTube account on both PCs, the video you clicked on your main PC will automatically show up on this page. You can just walk/switch over to your secondary PC or TV, click the tab, click the video, done.

Just a little hack to streamline your life a bit, maybe some peoeple already have methods for it or have already thought of this, but I figure it might be helpful to some. Hope you guys enjoy!!

**edit //** Note: You can also use this tip for Netflix by using your [Viewing Activity](https://www.netflix.com/WiViewingActivity). Not sure if that link will work for everyone, but it looks general enough! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey so this is the new hardware.

http://i.imgur.com/RlCj3VJh.jpg

My buddy wanted to record some guitar this summer and make a few tracks. He went to Guitar Center and purchased this. I wasn't able to go at the time that he went, so unfortunately I was not able to talk to the Guitar Center guy about this.

Anyways it works very nicely, it was plug-and-play into Logic Pro X and worked perfectly with all of their amps and effects. If you're interested in hearing it in action [here](https://soundcloud.com/echoesandghosts/echoes-and-ghosts-jeremy-1) is one of the tracks we made.

Anyways I am interested to know the other capabilities of this equipment. It worked so easily but I don't know shit about it because I didn't have to learn the hard way. 


TL;DR --

Here are some questions I have.

1. What *is it* essentially? As in what is this type of hardware called? I can Google for the rest after that probably.

2. Can I use this with any DAW or only the ones that it listed on the box? (It didn't listen Ableton or FL studio)

3. Can I only use this with compatibile DAWs' built-in guitar VSTs or components? Can I use this with 3rd party guitar VSTs with different amps/effects and it will work correctly?

4. If so, what are some of the top VSTs for guitar amps and effects / customization ability and all that?



Logic was pretty good but I'd love to see the possibilities with this piece of equipment. If you're able to offer any help I would be very gracious. I googled for a lot of these questions but the problem is that it's mostly really outdated forum posts talking about older models than the UR-12 and older DAWs like Logic 9 or Cubase 5  etc. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm 27. I am in good shape, I am currently working full time. Outside of that, I make music of many different varieties from alt R B and rap beats to producing live instruments hair metal-ish rock. I make my own spacey chilled out electronica music and have a little following on Soundcloud  / FB etc. which I am working on building up every day.


That is my #1 passion in life, I might talk about that a lot but I am pretty self aware and know when I'm talking about myself too much. 

I do fine with girls IRL so I don't mind if a girl wants to talk to me and be flirty and stuff but just don't expect it for it to turn into late night skype sessions or anything. Honestly since you're online, I would be way more interested in what's going on in your life, what you want to rant about, your shithead mom, the douche at work, even the guy who's chatting you up. I would love to have someone to bounce dating thoughts off of and who can bounce them off of me. Or any thoughts for that matter.

If you're not a girl and a dude who has similar interests to me etc. or just anyone looking for a pen pal, that's cool too.

I live a very functional and fulfilling life, but I also am really strange. I do a lot of psychedelics on my own time. It centers me in ways I would never imagine something could, and artistically it's pretty mind-blowing on an inspirational level. I'm the type of person that my extended family or coworkers etc. would be completely shocked to hear the things I was into. If you find that weird or off-putting, we're not for each other, and that's ok. 

I am totally down to talk about anything and everything from religiton to politics to sports to comic books (I don't know shit but you can school me on it) movies, wallpaper color choices, whatever.

Let me know if you want to be friends here, in PM or whatever works. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've tried posting this a few times in the past with no luck, but I want to hear this song again so bad that I gotta keep trying.

The track is from a mixtape by a rapper who never got really famous, but he was definitely featured at some point on DatPiff or was in the Hottest of the Month etc, so it's not completely unknown.


The hook went like this: **"Pressure makes (pause) Pressure makes Diamonds -- Pressure makes (pause) Pressure makes Diamondddsss" (the rapper says Diamonds more like "Di-meeee-nds")**

Also if I recall correctly, the instrumental had some sort of soul or brass / horn going on in the background.

It was a really dope song and I've been looking for it now for almost 2 years. The problem is that I can't remember anything else besides that hook, and it's not popular enough to actually have "lyrics" posted anywhere that Google can find.

Maybe you guys can help

Will the baby come out with their **base** stats increased by the outfit stats their parents had on?

or does only the green "base" part of the stat affect the baby's stats?

	<TITLE> Idea for an expansion / co-app for Fallout Shelter. It's called Wasteland Trader. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-12 09:27:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Wasteland Trader would be a separate app. It would be a completely separate game that would interact with FO:Shelter.
Basically think of it like Oregon Trail except the towns you stop at are peoples' Fallout Shelters.

People will get a notice on their Shelter that a trader has stopped by their shelter and at that point the shelter has the option to sell any equipment at their offering price. They are also allowed to peruse what the trader already has in their inventories and see if they want to buy any of the items.

It'd be a like a dynamic market for Fallout Shelter equipment, weapons, outfits, perhaps even some resources that Shelters can produce in future updates if they ever add in any sort of crafting mechanics to the game.

Now, within the Wasteland Trader game, you will be chugging along, building up your team of traders, fighting bandits, creatures, epic monsters, and all of the stuff that the Explorers are fighting out in the Wasteland now. Perhaps there could be some sort of built-in interaction with other traders, but it's kind of unnecessary and takes away from the purpose of the game which is to interact with shelters and create a bustling in-game economy.

Shelters could either be chosen, or I was thinking of having it randomized but have it all go by level -- build an overall Vault Level system into FO:Shelter, which can be based on the current one which is basically the number of dwellers you have in your vault.

This would make it so that same-level traders would interact with same-level shelters and so forth.

TL;DR It'd basically be like a bad-ass version of Oregon Trail with Wasteland monsters and a user-controlled, dynamic economy that you participate in. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone tried "Snap" eLiquids? [Review on Kiwi Strawberry included] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-11 09:34:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> They're pretty overtly based on Snapple. I just picked up a bottle of Kiwi Strawberry.

One thing I noticed right after removing the plastic seal was the smell of Snapple really hit me. The smell is spot freaking on to Snapple. It's crazy how accurate it is. I hope someone else who has tried this juice can weigh in on this,  I was surprised at the replication of the smell, right down to the subtle complexities that really wake the memory up like you just cracked open a bottle of some kind of Snapple / Sobe / Arizona juice.

The taste is really good. It's not extremely strong, and I don't think I taste the Kiwi that much, but there's definitely something hinting at the Strawberry that makes it different from other strawberries I've tried. I have very little experience with the Kiwi flavor in general, perhaps that's the Kiwi. It's a nice note on the Strawberry flavor. It has a great Strawberry taste as its primarily inhale and exhale and a very slight, nearly unnoticeable taste of tea, similar to Snapple.  That's the note that brings the whole juice together IMO and makes it pretty unique and definitely hits what they were going for. It's fruity and fresh, it smells pretty nice after you exhale it.

I get very little throat hit and the vapor production is solid. It's a quality juice. The guy at the shop told me it's 80/20 but the bottle doesn't say anything, I can't find anything online on the ratio either. I would say judging from the throat hit and vapor production it's definitely that, at least 70/30.

If you see the juice in your shop, definitely give it a quick try. If you like fruit liquids, want something fresh and not overpowering or too sweet, it's pretty tastey for those purposes. No perfumey-ness or artificial vibe to it. Good stuff, I'll be happy to finish my bottle.

7.5/10

Interested to know if you guys have tried this line or the liquid specifically and what your thoughts are. The more reviews the better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Here is my first review on White Borneo](https://www.reddit.com/r/KratomKorner/comments/3f7w0z/freshkratom_reviews_1_white_borneo/)

**Green Malay**

This time I was at work, on my one overnight per week. I figured it would be a good time to try the Green Malay. Popped open the bag and took a teaspoon and a half. At this point in time I had a lot of paperwork to catch up on, so I went into the office to get myself situated and figure out what I had to do.

The Green Malay took a noticeably longer time than most kratoms Ive had to come into its own. At first I felt a very mild, almost unnoticeable feeling of muscle relaxation and mood improvement. It was probably about 20 minutes in as I was sitting at the desk writing out my forms. 

It took about an hour, but finally the full effect came into play. The best way I can describe the Green Malay is a mild happy powder. Its definitely not the strain that will get you up and to the gym, and its not the strain you want before going to sleep -- but if youre an overthinker, you get anxiety, your mind messes with you by never just shutting off for awhile, definitely give this strain a try. 

My motivation to do my paperwork had been noticeably improved, I felt myself slipping hypnotically into my work more easily than I usually do. Normally I write a few sentences and Im already looking up at the computer for a new song or looking at the clock etc. but I felt that the wave of chill that the Green brought on, and I reckon that it stopped me a few times from losing focus when normally I mightve. 


I felt much less tense that morning. In my opinion the Green Malay is utterly perfect for someone who is trying to kill off some ADHD symptoms without the use of prescription stimulants. Its not going to be like Adderall in powder form, but it really took the edge off enough for me to find my flow state much more easily. I enjoyed this one a lot, and because of my personal struggles with focusing and not overthinking things, its definitely going to be a regular staple in my inventory.

Another benefit the Green Malay might have for people is as an anti-depressant. It definitely improved my mood, I felt a little more giddy and upbeat while I worked. I think partly because I was realizing the effect it had on my focus, and partly because it just has that anxiolytic effect by nature.

**Would I buy this strain?** Yes! I plan on it. This strains effects is a great benefit to me personally. If youre similar to me in the habit of not being able to turn your brain off and having trouble focusing because of it -- I would highly recommend trying this one out. If youre having a shit day and having one of those I need a drink feelings but you dont feel like getting drunk -- I think this could be a nice extra supplement for improving your mood that day.

**TL;DR**

Type: Moderate 0-1hour come up 1-2.5h peak 2.5-5h after-glow

Amount taken: ~3.5g

* Mild taste (as with many greens)
* Mild euphoria
* ADHD killer
* Weakens anxiety / tendency for overthinking
* Not speedy, not great for physical activity IMO
* Slight crash which just feels like a mild drowsiness for an hour or so. Can be cured by a cup of coffee.

	<TITLE> Fresh-Kratom Reviews! #1: White Borneo </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-31 00:54:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ive been through several different vendors, and awhile back I had been posting on a different Kratom sub to open a discussion about comparing two vendors in quality vs. price. 

I had been contacted by one of these vendors sister website owner, Lisa, and Fresh-Kratom.com, who offered me the opportunity to see for myself just how the product matches up against the vendors Ive been through.

I thought this was a generous offer and feel obliged to share my experiences and descriptions of the samples so that this opportunity can benefit the community as a whole. Hope you guys enjoy these reviews and get some info from them, and a feel for the experience. If you don't want to read all my drivel, just skip to the bottom for a quick summary!

Ill just say this up front: I had mostly a great experience with these strains. I dont mean to have it sound like an advertisement, but you have to call it how you see it. This site offers a pretty diverse selection of strains, the prices are much better than other sites Ive used, and the quality of the kratom was not sacrificed to achieve this, which Ill get into. I have had some seriously amazing kratom strains and IMO there were 2/4 that are in that same arena. Lisa was cool and the personal touch to the website is pretty nice... especially when youre in a world of vendors where youre not sure where your product is coming from or where it was before that, shes transparent about her sourcing and you deal with her personally, shes in the Northeast U.S. so the shipping was quick at least for me.

**On to the reviews!** The strains I tried were the following:

* White Borneo
* Green Malay
* Red Horned
* Red Bali

**White Borneo** 

I had gotten home from work, threw on some coffee, and decided it was time to delve into these samples. I work a rolling schedule, and I had just come back from my one overnight per week. Being in a weird state where I was pretty exhausted, yet wired up from getting home, the White Borneo seemed like the best option to get a little kick back into my day and get some work done around the house before crashing. 

I took a heaping teaspoon of the White Borneo, poured a cup of steaming hot coffee and got into the shower. I take a pretty long shower and was probably in there for at least 12 minutes. By the time I had gotten out, I could feel a little bit of a tingle in my toes, my muscles felt noticeably more relaxed than the typical end of a shower, which was really nice.

About 20 minutes in, I started to feel a wave of relaxation and alertness come over me. My motions felt slightly more fluid as I walked and moved, and I began cleaning up my bathroom. I didnt feel a burst of energy, I just felt this steady wave of energy where I wasnt feeling wired up, more like I was on autopilot and it wasnt really tiring me out.. Ive had Kratom that makes me almost want to burst into a sprint or jump on some furniture or something, and this wasnt like that. However it certainly wasnt slow either. It did not tire me out, make me want to crash, kill my motivation. 

Some people talk about potential for anxiety from Kratom, I have never had this. I dont take anything more than 4G at the very maximum at one dosing, so maybe Im just not taking enough, but this strain did not cause any anxiety whatsoever and neither did any of the others.

The cleaning then transferred into my bedroom, kitchen, TV room, and whole house. The Kratom peak felt like it lasted about 1 hour, it took about 40 minutes to reach that point, and this particular strain caused me to have a really nice after-glow feeling from the Kratom for at least 2-3 hours after the peak. 

During this "after-glow" period I felt refreshed, awake, and in no way like I had just worked a long shift. I think if I had tried to go to sleep I would've had trouble, so I would shy away from taking this strain when you want to get some rest. It was a great addition to a cup of coffee and restored my vitality for several hours that morning. I really enjoyed it, and I have taken a little more of the sample and had similar experiences while working on my computer. It didn't make me want to get up and do something else like some fast strains do and really got me to hunker down and get into what I was making.

**Would I buy this strain?** Maybe. It was really  enjoyable, but theres another strain Im about to review that I would actually buy in place of it. Me personally? Id go right to the White Maeng Das if I want fast. However if you have a job where you need to maintain a steady level of energy and attention focus, and you dont want the whole straight up and crash a few hours later that a Maeng Da can cause, definitely look into the White Borneo. I felt no crash and a noticeable and pleasant feeling of energy and focus.


**TL;DR** 

Type: Moderate-fast
Experience: 0-40 min come up. 40min-2h peak 2h-4h after-glow
Amount taken: 2.5-3g

* Mild taste
* Moderate but steady increase in energy, focus, strength, physical / mental ability
* Not speedy enough to cause a crash, not slow enough to make you sleepy.
* Not the strongest strain Ive ever had in any particular department, but a great mix where you get a little of each.

Don't get me wrong,  his juices are amazing. They live up to the hype tenfold,  you taste some of these juices and you wonder how they weren't hyped even more. 

That being said,  where did this title for Philip Rocke come from? Is it a genius marketing strategy that is working really well, or did he really win some awards or earn that name for himself in other ways? Just curious about the history of this guy and how he came to be known as one of the world's best mixers.

	<TITLE> I just got in some "Vape Flakes" from Breakfast Club. It's a juice based on Frosted Flakes. Here is my review. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-21 05:55:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This juice is absolutely putrid. It doesn't taste like Frosted Flakes, it doesn't have any milk or cream notes whatsoever. It tastes like burnt vanilla custard. I can't describe it any better than that. Distinct burnt taste, overly sweet with no depth behind the sweetness, no pastry or "flake" taste, just this gross sugary vanilla-ish burnt taste.

Many websites claim that it's a max VG juice, or high VG ratio, this is not true. I can tell very clearly just by spinning the bottle around that this has lots of PG. The clouds are weak, there is a throat hit, and the vapor dissipates in a few seconds. I would wager this juice is not even 70/30.

Just warning people to not waste your money on this juice. I welcome anyone who has tried it to post an opposing opinion, since that's what a forum is for! ...however if you love cereal vapes, and you thought Frosted Flakes would be interesting, definitely pass on this.


**EDIT: If you searched for this post and found it, check the comments for more info. After steeping this juice it wasn't as bad as the initial review.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone know what's up with this juice? It used to be so delicious, creamy, complex and tasted like rich yellow cake with chocolate frosting.

Lately the last few bottles have totally lost the creamy yellow cake flavor. Now it has this bland sweet taste, I can't even describe it, but it's rather boring, gets old quickly, and tastes way cheaper than the price of the juice.

Did the company change manufacturing companies or something? I don't know if it's just me but it seems consistently different now, and not an improvement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason I ask is that it seems like one of the biggest setbacks for the German army was their small size. Had they recruited and attempted to build armies from the countries they conquered, I could've seen them being even more of a danger to the rest of the world. I am not extremely well versed in history so apologies if this post looks very lay-man. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was just wondering how these two compared to each other. Happy Hippo has been my go-to for awhile but the prices on buy-kratom.us are too good to just pass by.
I wanted to know if anyone has ordered from both websites... do you get what you pay for, or is Happy Hippo just that overpriced?

Another good thing about HH is that it comes to my door in 2 days every single time. If I order on a Thursday morning, it's there saturday, they never miss a beat, and I live halfway across the country from their offices. Was wondering how the shipment times are from buy-kratom.us to the US too. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone up for a little fun internet scavenger hunt? Can you find the introduction video or theme music to the Disney TV show "The Jersey" anywhere on the web? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-09 17:42:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll tell you why you most likely will not find it.

The intro music to this show has a guitar riff that is a direct ripoff of [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuJZeGTpg4o t=0m18s) (mobile users the riff is at 18seconds) ... like it was a blatant, spot on rip-off.

For some reason Disney never got sued for this by STP.

They've done a fantastic job of burying this show completely, never to see the light of day again -- however bits and pieces can be seen on the internet here and there -- but NOWHERE is the intro music or the video sequence. It's not on any websites anywhere, any place. I double-dog-dare you to find it. You won't.

If someone finds this I will mail the winner a picture of my cat with a mini sombrero hat along with 20 U.S. dollars. I'm broke, and I don't own a mini sombrero hat, or a cat. That's how confident I am that you will not find this.

Let the games begin. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> He had a very specific name, it was something in his language and then "man" I'm pretty sure. He was from one of those Northern European countries like Norway, Sweden, Netherlands etc. I believe his name actually meant "Fat man" in his language.

He used to have all these webcams set up in his home and Stern Fan Network's Lounge was addicted to watching this guy for a few months. He was a nudist, he also made art, and would mostly just lay around his home fully nude (you really couldn't see anything) typing to people in his chatroom or would go in his weird indoor hot tub, have random prostitute friends over, it was a grand time.

If anyone was around the lounge in the Late 00's or early 10's you might remember him. Wanted to see if this guy was still around the internet. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Worst moments in vaping </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-09 08:18:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let's see if we can get a list together, here are some of my face-palm vaping moments

- Running out of all battery life while you're out (obvious one)

- Forgetting one thing before leaving the house for the day (spare battery, your juice, the actual mod)

- Thinking you saturated the brand new coil and taking your first big draw from it -- it wasn't actually saturated at all

- (This happened to me a few times before I learned my lesson) Not turning the cap on the juice all the way, putting the bottle on the table, eventually knocking over the bottle somehow, not noticing, and losing half my juice onto the table </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to get the most flavor out of the Atlantis 2. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-08 05:02:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have found a pretty good method, not sure if you guys have a better one or have some improvements for mine. This is also completely subjective, what tastes good to me might be different for you!

First of all, I like the .5 coils. The vapor is still hot, but in my subjective opinion I think the temperature is just hot enough to bring out the flavor without being so hot that you lose a bit of the detail.

Fill the tank with your juice, put on the .5 coil, let the coil get saturated, take a few puffs to get it fully going etc, or you already have this done.

Now close off the top airholes completely. Position the bottom airholes so that they're on the biggest setting.

Now turn the bottom airholes so that you only have two holes ( for a visual, I'd say about the size of the end of a dripper cap from a juice bottle).

This part may vary from device to device (I use the XPro M80+) but set it around 55 watts. This is enough to produce a nicely satisfying amount of vapor, the vapor is warm but not hot, and all of the complexity in the juice really comes out so nicely. Getting the tight airflow helps a ton.


So the TL;DR version is:

* .5 coils

* Close the top airholes

* Set the bottom airholes to the wider setting

* Rotate the bottom ring so that the wide airholes are closed off to the point where you have a little opening on each side

* Set device around 55w

* Enjoy warm, dense, flavorful vapor (beginner vaper hint: Try exhaling through your nose)

* Tweak to your liking!

P.S. For the .3 coils, everything is the same except the output is 68w </TEXT>

It's an image that explains the path to get to The Strip when you start the game in easy terms, then goes on to tell you to gamble your money when you get there etc.

Just wondering if anyone has seen this or has it on their hard drive and can share! </TEXT>
