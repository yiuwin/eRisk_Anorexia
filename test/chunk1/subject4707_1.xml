	<TITLE> Bootloop issue, Frustrated!! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-21 14:55:52 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hello Reddit!

My PC is now borderline useless and I'm clueless how to fix it - leaving me frustrated.

I have been having bootloop issues for the past 4 months which have progressively been getting worse until as of last night when it now does not boot at all.

Backstory:

I started noticing my PC fans would start up, get to the 'Gigabyte' display screen (my make of Mobo) then turn off and reset 3-4 times and then eventually boot completely. I'd then game with absolutely no performance issues for a couple hours and didn't think much of it.

This then progressed more to the point I reset my PC with a full hard drive reformat and complete new install of Windows, then fully updated all drivers and Windows update. This was fine for a few days before then going back to the boot loops

Fast forward to last night -it won't boot whatsoever.
The fans start up for literally 1 second, off. Then restarts itself, 1 second then off. It won't even get to the Gigabyte display screen to say the Mobo has booted. I eventually got it on after hours of tinkering and played for a good 4 hours on max settings with ZERO performance issues, it's just getting it started. 

I have changed the PSU from a 600w to a 750w as there was a sale on and it's still not functioning. I've tried both ram sticks one at a time and still nothing, and without the GPU, still nothing.

Help would be much appreciated!!

	<TEXT> At university I actually learnt why suicides are so different which leads to a skew in the figures for suicides.

Women are inherently tidy, they do not like mess subconsciously which leads to "cleaner" deaths such as medication overdose, hanging. 

Men do not tend to care and being more inherently "lazy" they go for the faster solutions such as shooting and cutting.

Seeing as the methods men typically go for, the success rate is higher per attempt compared to women who still have time to be saved if found

This is a rough observation based on 2014 numbers and both genders do overlap and do the other methods than above but I think that may help the questions I've seen about why less men attempt to take their life but a higher number are successful </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's commendable but only solidifies my point. I've played 3 seasons and 2 preseasons in gold and I'm being placed in a tier with people with new fresh and unranked accounts that haven't set foot in ranked. Like I said, yes I'll climb out. The fact I have to start in there is what's baffling me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was gold 2, playing with people around my Elo. Sometimes higher, this was before the season ended and then got G1 in preseason (yes I know that doesn't mean anything but my MMR remained the same). So I'm not seeing the logic of me being put 2 tiers lower. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not trying to win every game mate, I'm trying to have more control of my outcome. Sticking me in a tier notorious for these issues after I've been in gold for 3.5 years is absolutely pointless.

I agree with you on the 30/40/30 rule...in the tier you belong in. Playing games in the Elo you belong in. But playing 30/40/30 2 entire tiers lower is completely unfair given how long I've been playing higher for. It's just senseless.

Would also like to mention that the 40% of wins from outcomes and decisions is a bullshit thing when you're in a division with players who simply cannot play the game and therefor dragging that 40% much higher than the usual number because I'm lazily put here for no reason. </TEXT>

Every game I've played GP I have been getting TriF @ ~13 minutes. I followed the stickies guide by starting with mana crystal and regen pot and backing for sheen and cull at ~1300. Works very well!

Thanks for the insight, better start working on them barrel timings  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello guys! I have recently taken on top lane as I have grown to love it.

My first pick is Renekton to get in people's faces however I want a completely different and fun pick to take into match ups we have lots of tanks or I can't play Renekton in to.

I tried the 100% crit build and felt whilst I was critting a lot I felt the damage was lower and was told the "50/50" build will always give higher crits but...

What does the 50/50 build consist of? Struggling to find it!

I will probably end up maining GP as he is by far the most fun champion I've ever played I just suck with barrel combos at the moment! I either put my last barrel too far and it misses the chain, or I'm not fast enough placing the last barrel so the first two explode without it xD

Thanks for the advice in advance!

	<TEXT> I'm a very new Renekton player but generally speaking I think a lot of people tend to go on champion.gg and build a very static and generic build every time and that's why he has a reputation to fall off

I mean as everyone catches up yes you'll be less affective than you were but I think you'll have a much better time if you focus on building to lock down your lane opponent as opposed to building for usefulness in teamfights. 

I was always incorporating BC + Tiamat item in my build and went full tank after but it's only recently I've started building counter items like DD and BoTRK that I've really started to see what renekton can do. Shut their laner down and split and the maximum the fight is gonna be is 4v4 but you'll dumpster your laner and take towers so they could even send 2 to stop you...effectively giving up objectives even if you die

TL;DR - build for your laner, not the team. Lock him down, split that shit.

Yeah I've generally been just playing normals and nose diving champions and seeing what happens really. I generally love the level 2/3 ignite cheese though! Seems to work really well with TLD but I'm very much looking forward to the fervor buffs!

Having an absolute blast on him though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I can definitely see his strengths due to versatility in build paths, masteries, runes and summoners due to comps and match ups. Plus the surprise factor as he isn't played much recently! I think if you're stomping AD renekton is fine as one player will have to come stop your split top whilst you're team 4v4s bot lane siege and AD renekton will stomp most 1v1 </TEXT>

Yeah a few people have noticed that the Panther combo is more for finesse than actual needed gameplay. But it's nice to work on so I'll go for that :)

Summoners I tend to take into whatever I'm facing. I'm an advocate of building on strengths instead of playing around weaknesses. Whilst renekton can teamfight, he specialises around 1v1 lockdown and pushing so I think taking every summoner but TP could work should the situation call for it. If you know you can kill your opponent with a certain summoner to snowball then do it is my opinion!

Thanks for the advice and I'm hoping to push Plat this season, hopefully the croc gets me there! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah awesome! Thanks for the tips. I usually rush Tiamat in lane then finish black cleaver whilst deciding what Tiamat upgrade I'll get after. Thanks for the tips!

I'll have to just practise Panther but it does seem like something that is more of a min max thing than a necessity. Still nice to have in the arsenal though!

Thanks for the other animation cancel tips too, much appreciated </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for the reply! I shall check out them channels now, thanks for them.

I do prefer ignite myself! 

What levels does renekton usually power spike at? I know 3 is his first as that's when he gets his full combo available but I have killed people with flash empowered W, ignite Q at level 2 recently.

Hope to see you on the rift! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello /r/renektonmains!

I usually main adc, and after queuing I was auto filled top, to my surprise. Upon loading screen I saw the enemy top was a Renekton and thought "Huh, haven't seen one of them in a while. Should be easy".

It got to the 3rd or 4th wave and my casual farming was interrupted in what can only be described as me getting dumpstered. When I say dumpstered I mean any shred of humanity was left the moment he turned me into a pixelated pile of shame. This happened another 7-8 times as I proceeded to rock myself in the corner of the fountain till we lost.

I then picked renekton and had an absolute blast button mashing and actually liked his playstyle. Whilst inefficient as I started I realised his strengths and after 2 days of solid play I wanted to ask a few questions to really make a push forward.

I've heard talk of this "panther combo". I took TLD into bot games so I could clearly tell when I successfully did it but it was mainly me button bashing.

Questions!

In panther combo do I E, Q and then click for the AA or do I E, AA and then Q? Wasn't sure which way around it was

Does Tiamat and ravenous cancel the W animation? If so, does it lower the damage of W as it needs to strike 2-3 times or does it not matter whatsoever?

When do I take ignite or TP? I usually just split all day, bully lane and force someone to stop me so the ignite gets me earlier kills where as I don't see as much need for TP?

I know that Q cancels Tiamat animation which is awesome.

Any help would be much appreciated as I've had so much fun on a very versatile and engaging champ. He does so much
