	<TEXT> Your opinion on The Man In The High Castle is very reassuring for me. Yes, I agree that last season's ending sucked but I couldn't dropped a show that holds my interest on alternate history so its great to hear that season 2 is an improvement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bates Motel is THAT good this year?? I stopped watching after the second season. It just didn't interest me enough to watch another season. I'll probably catch up to the show someday. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **You're The Worst S03E01-E04** - This show is just too hard to watch for someone who's also suffering from depression but damn this season is really firing on all cylinders. I'm enjoying Samira Wiley's therapist character so far.  

**The Man In The High Castle S02E01-E02** - After last year's lackluster season finale (at least for me), this season is an improvement. Nice to actually focus on the characters this time.  

**Quarry S01E05** - For the first few episodes I've always wondered why do I watch this show but now I'm fully invested and ready to finish it. The cinematography and story is just something to be admired.  

**30 Rock S05** - On my first rewatch. I dunno. When I'm too lazy to invest an hour for those shows I've mentioned, I just watch some good ol 30 Rock.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The finale was still great. Wrapped up the whole series nicely but the flashbacks over the season made story disjointed. And yes, that serial killer storyline was terrible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Story actually drags after they leave the buffer zone. They just kinda stretched the whole resistance thing for like the last 6 episodes. But the show's production value is something to be admired.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. The pilot was amazing but the rest of the season was just... meh. I just think it was such a waste that they gave the spy storyline such focus. The Sixers was much more intriguing. Too bad we never got a second season. </TEXT>
