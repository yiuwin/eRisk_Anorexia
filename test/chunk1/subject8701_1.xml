The most Infinity Gems you can hold is 3, or you lose.

This brings him down to 18 Hit.

There are not really enough cards for you to get through where you can build up enough fight for him. I have managed to take away 2 of them, but I can't get him before the villain deck runs out.

I am using:

- Rocket Racoon
- Star-Lord (and relying heavily on his artifacts to keep feeding me shards, but I can't run the risk of the shards running out.
- Gamora

I have managed it in 2 player (me playing both hands), but not single player yet.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have played hundreds of games, but one thing that I have never really thought about is when a card is 'played'.

Let's say I have a guy with 4 fight and, maybe, a 'stealth' type.

Then a guy with 0 fight but gains 4 fight if you have played a 'stealth' type.

Would I be able to combine them for 8 fight, or would I need to kill a villain with 4 (i.e. actually playing the card), before I can use the second card.

OR

Do I think of it as like 'health'. One guy pummels until the villain (assume is 8 fight) down to 4, and now the other guy can pop up and hit down the final 4, but if he does not, the health of the villain is reset at the end of the round.

Hope that was understandable, if not, feel free to ask and I shall clarify! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [For Hire] Experienced native British writer looking for new projects </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-16 08:54:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Good afternoon!

Native British writer here.

I have been working on a freelance basis for 6 years now. I recently have had a hole open up in my schedule and I am looking to fill it as quickly as possible. 

I don't think there is a niche I have yet to write in. However, I hold a law degree from a British University so this, of course, is my speciality.  However, there is barely a subject that I am unable to tackle. These are some of the 'large scale' projects I have tackled recently:

- Provided 25 articles per week for over 2 years to one of the largest personal injury law firms in the United Kingdom.

- I supply a network of 'Casino Affiliate' sites with 25 articles per week. I have been doing this for almost a year with no sign of the project slowing down. 

I have 2,000 words per day to fill. I am charging $7.50 per 1,000 words, so $15 for the full 2,000. I would prefer to 'block book' this to an individual client. I am charging a 'discount' rate for this content, and it would be better for me to sell it to an individual client, just to cut down on all of those pesky PayPal fees. However, I am willing to 'break' this content down into smaller chunks if you can guarantee regular work.

If you have any questions, drop me a PM. I tried to keep this post 'short and sweet', so there is a lot that has not been covered. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Back in October last year, I had a 'mass' email session. I sent about 500 emails and produced about 100 x 250-word samples. I gained 18 clients from those 100. About 50 people did not get back to me, even when pushed. A couple said that my style was not right for them, which is fair, my style is a bit more unique, but I would be willing to change it up for them (they only gave me a keyword and said roll with it). The people who did not get back to me, I figured they just did not like what I produced.

Today, I am sitting at my computer and I get a phone call on Skype. Somebody who never got back to me told me that he loved my work in October. Decided to settle for a long term contract (pending approval with his manager, but I am sure that will go through). I hang up, another phone call, again from somebody who did not get back to me back in October.

What is it? Why can't these clients just respond to me when I send a sample to them initially? Just to say "we are keeping you on file". It would be so much easier if I knew how effective my samples were.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend pointed it out to me (I live in Sweden). Since I have been back in England, I have asked numerous people. We all pronounce the 'Ireland' in a different way depending on the context.

Is this due to the way TV pronounces it, or are we just retarded? No matter what I do, I can't get the 'Ireland' in 'Northern Ireland' to sound the same as just saying 'Ireland'.

We are on the south coast of the country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I write about British Constitutional Law.

While it is lucrative, I only have to work 3 hours a week, I feel like I could probably tackle a lot more work.

Most of the clients I have come from Twitter and the like plus recommendations.

I supplement the rest of my work with casinos and the like. Nothing extravagent. It pays the bills, but I feel like I should be putting my law degree to better use.

Should I expand what I write about? I could feasibly see some crossover with British Constitutional Law and Politics, maybe a touch of the economy (a lot of my work is related to Brexit)

Anybody have any idea about how I can expand who I target? I am thinking about releasing some reports to the media and getting them picked up. This is something I did to great effect when I was writing about Swedish Rape Legislation.

Any suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been working as a freelance writer for years. It is fun. However, I recently managed to get hold of this client who just can't seem to grasp that the world does not revolve around her. I have to deal with comments like:

- My content is the most important as I pay in advance (yeah, as do 30 other weekly clients)

- You should not leave my content to the last minute. I plan my time to a tee. It does not matter what time I give her, she wants it delivered before that.
- Your writing process is terrible. Do it this way. Yeah. I have been freelance writing for over 10 years now, you have been doing it for 2 years, love. My process is nigh on perfect. 

Now I am tired and exhausted. Thankfully, I will be done with this project soon. </TEXT>
