	<TEXT> the debt is largely due to a lot of corruption....i dnt want to get into that too much but you can research for yourself. But it was also due to an economic plan to invest in local infrastructure and heavily on public transport and roadways. Srsly, if someone from America was to go to SL they would be amazed as to how improved our transport has become. Its an investment for the future </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there is no correlation. Whilst (possibly russian backed) rebels are fighting against Ukranian army, China is providing a trade route for not only China, but also greater connections for Sri Lanka, India and surrounding countries.


to add to the crimea situation, it seems more of an incentive for countries such as the US to close down across Russia and allow US to install army bases across the region (eg. Lithuania recently) through fear by media.

	<TEXT> well the former Presidents have made significant positive impact on the country (well with a lot of corruption too) in terms of infrastructure but more on the national roadway which costed the country in excess of 1 billion. Although I dont necessarily support them, the government did take a lot of initiative which boosted the country's economic growth and increased job opportunities.

	<TEXT> All right I will give some context to all of this....Sri Lanka is currently in debt by 8Bil to China. This is a very large sum compared to our annual GDP. We need large investment to drive our economy. Ive seen a significant change in the city with significant increase in tourism (mainly from China and the West) which is greatly helping our economy as we are able to tap into the chinese tourism industries(the largest tourism market). We are also able to see competition from other countries such as the US which is further helping our economy to grow.

Now the issue with Hambantota is quite complicated. The price of land in sri lanka is increasing significantly each year but there is a lot of discomfort with the majority sinhala people who believe that their 'land is being taken away' by foreigners from wealthy countries such as the Maldives, India and Middle Eastern countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia who have bought large amount of the north building large tourist hotels. This added with increasing resentment between buddhists against islamic people over the significant rise in the islamic population in sri lanka largely due to the birth rate, a lot of sinhalese people believe that they are losing control of their country which is driving fear. 

From the instability, the opposing parties under the support of many buddhist monks are staging large protests. However, many people are overlooking the serious need for chinese invetments in the region and there is also a large support(unheard in the medi) for these investments as it is also helping the local economy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just checking through the OpenNIC server list (https://servers.opennicproject.org/)
and saw that you could choose a Tier 1 DNS provider which I didnt think was available for public. I wanted to know whether its safer to choose a TIER 1 network DNS as you are getting access directly from a source...if you get what I mean.

What I WANT TO KNOW: Any added privacy, security etc.?
Also, what DNS resolver do you recommend for anonymity or security, is Comodo really safe?. </TEXT>
