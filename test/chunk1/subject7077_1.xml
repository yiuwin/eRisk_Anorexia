	<TITLE> Rebirth Subscription Service? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-30 23:31:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With the new Rebirth pricepoint of $2.99, I absolutely plan on getting back into reading comics. I'm between going down to my local comic shop and buying them there, or getting a subscription service that would send them to me every month.

I was wondering if anyone knows of any subscription services that would be helpful or if you've had experience with some that I should I avoid.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all. I just started a sub, /r/interviewwithakiller. I have the subject material knowledge down pretty well (my MA is in Criminal Justice), but I could use some help on the modding end.

I could use someone who knows how to use CSS to pretty up the sub and occasionally come in and help with any further CSS issues that may arise. Of course you'd be welcome to mod as well. I'd like someone with some experience a proof with a sub you've worked on would be great.

I could also use some help promoting the sub. I do it where I can but I'll be the first to admit I am terrible at it. I don't need someone who is going to be immature and post the link everywhere. I'd like someone who could tell me how they will promote the sub without giving the sub a bad rep (I hope that make sense, if not then I will clarify). And of course you can help with general modding duties.

Interest in the subject material would be helpful and a generally mature personality. Let me know if you're interested! </TEXT>

For the time being, I'm going to give everyone the ability to flair their video with the flairs I create. We'll use this thread to perfect them and list complaints/ideas regarding the amount and type of flairs that should exist. 

Let me know what you think!

So far the flairs are: 

* Confesses
* Accidentally Confesses
* Single Murder
* Not Convicted
* Serial Killer 
* Non-Criminal

	<TITLE> Drama erupts when a video of a SMITE streamer calling people who consider suicide selfish assholes is posted in /r/cringe. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-19 21:34:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I feel like that is title gore, my bad. 

A little bit of context. This streamer plays a game called SMITE. During one of his streams he receives a donation from a viewer. The donation comes with a message from the viewer that says he/she was considering suicide last year but watching the streamer's videos helped him/her out of it. The streamer then goes on a rant to basically call the donator/viewer a selfish asshole and let him know "he isn't attacking him personally, just trying to wake him up" and that suicide is a stupid thing. He then further goes on to talk about his views regarding depression. [Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/4fjbr9/drama_erupts_when_a_video_of_a_smite_streamer/d29blt3) is more context from Blacksheep2134.

	<TEXT> Welcome everyone to /r/InterviewWithAKiller! I will begin working on the CSS over the weekend so if you're entering the sub and it feels a little empty, that will change soon. 

This will be a sub dedicated to content that features interviews, text or video, of killers. They can range from one-time killers to serial killers, adults to children, funny to haunting. All content is welcome as long as it features an interview with a killer.

I'm sure questions will come up regarding submissions that I haven't considered yet, if that happens please feel free to just shoot me a PM and I'll let you know how we will handle it here.

Welcome and enjoy! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all! I was hoping you could help me out with a little dilemma I'm having. I just bought a Wii U for my girlfriend, but she is out of town this weekend so I have it all to myself. WSIB?

We have Pokken Tournament and Mario Cart 8, the former of which is pretty damn fun. For some background, I have a PS4 and Xbox One. I'll list some games that I have played/enjoyed on them:

* Dragon Age Inquisition
* Fallout 4
* Witcher 3
* Both Tomb Raiders
* Divinity Original Sin 
* Dying Light
* GTA V
* Shadow of Mordor
* The Last of Us

This is hardly comprehensive, so feel free to ask about any others. I'm unsure of what to buy purely because I have never had a Nintendo system aside from a 3DS for Pokemon and Fire Emblem. I've always considered hopping into the Zelda series (I feel like that is poor terminology, my apologies), but I don't know where to start. So either something for that or something entirely random, hit me up! Thanks for the help in advance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been playing 5e for about 6 months with a group of guys I met here on Reddit.

Recently, however, I have begun DMing (for the first time) for my friends who were interested in trying 5e. They love it btw. My question is, how do you handle combat as a DM? I find myself becoming easily overwhelmed and disorganized trying to keep track of initiatives/health/AC/etc. 

For reference, I use a mix of Roll20 and pen   paper. I don't know if it matters- but I also keep rolls out in the open (on Roll20) for the most part, I like to live and die by the die (unless it takes away from the narrative). Do you have any tricks to help you keep track of everything going on during combat?   </TEXT>

The rest of these are all responses to OP's top [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3tkbpf/man_assaulted_with_pickaxe_in_britain_over/cx6ugnf): "I'm so glad the religion of Islam is peaceful. Imagine what would have happened if they were violent. /s"

	<TITLE> NYC permit question regarding a pergola and an outdoor patio </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-03 22:01:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I live in Manhattan. Attached to my apartment is a patio that is purely a feature to my apartment. The patio is about 8 feet by 15 feet. I technically have to walk down a flight of steps to get down to it. So I am on the 3rd floor and it is on the roof of the building next to mine. My downstairs (2nd floor) neighbor has access to a patio right next to my own. A bar is below us and there are buildings attached to ours so neighbors can see our patio.

Here is my question: Do I need a permit to put a pergola on my patio? I know it's not a huge question, but I'd like to put one up and I'd rather have all of my ducks in a row beforehand.

If you need any clarifying information please let me know.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (WiFi/Smogon doubles OU format) Rate/Fix My Team </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-06 10:13:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I made this doubles team after a few weeks of learning about competitive battling. I didn't want to bring it here till I had play tested it however. It did pretty well in WiFi battles, about a 70% win rate. Overall I have found that I'm a little weak on entry hazards removal and placement, and switching out. Only Landorus has a switching out mechanic in U-Turn. I also could use some suggestions for Gyrados, I just have not found him to be useful and wouldn't mind a change.

So far the team is very defensive based with Mega Venusaur taking hits/healing, and Klefki who has just been an incredible asset with Prankster. I tend to paralyze/put up strong defensive walls, then bring a sweeper in Hydreigon or Landorus. If I'm getting blocked out Sylveon has been incredible with Hyper Voice and either one shotting dragons or lowering enemies health to half so they can be picked off by my faster pokemon.

This is my first team ever so just please be understanding of that, thanks so much! Also if I miscalculate some EVs my apologies. I'm still new at checking them. 

Klefki w/Light Clay. Ability: Prankster Nature: Bold EVs: 252 Sp.D, 252 HP, 6 Def.  Moves: Paralyze, Toxic, Light Screen, Reflect

Sylveon w/Pixie Plate. Ability: Pixilate Nature: Bold EVs: 252 Def, 252 HP, 6 Speed.  Moves: Hyper Voice, Shadow Ball, Psyshock, Moonblast

Hydreigon w/Choice Specs. Ability: Levitate Nature: Timid EVs: 252 Sp. Attk, 252 Speed, 6 Def.  Moves: Flamethrower, Dragon Pulse, Earth Power, Dark Pulse

Venusaur w/Venusaurite. Ability: Overgrow/Thick Fat Nature: Bold EVs: 252 HP, 252 Def, 6 Speed.  Moves: Leech Seed, Sludge Bomb, Giga Drain, Synthesis

Landorus w/Choice Scarf. Ability: Intimidate Nature: Adamant EVs: 252 Attk, 252 Speed, 6 Def.  Moves: Earth Quake, Knock Off, U-turn, Stone Edge

Gyrados w/Life Orb. Ability: Intimidate Nature: Adamant EVs: 252 Attk, 150 HP, 100 Speed, 8 Sp. Def.  Moves: Stone Edge, Waterfall, Thunder Wave, Earthquake

Generally I've just been doing my best to pick the right counters with Klefki as a pretty common lead in unless they have a lot of fire types. I tend to take it slow and paralyze/leech seed a lot to slowly drain, and eventually bring in sweepers to clean up.

Thanks again and please let me know if I missed any information you may need!

	<TEXT> Hi Uberdrivers! My girlfriend and I are moving to NYC in a few months and she has considered becoming a part time Uber driver. This all started when one of our Uber drivers while we were visiting mentioned he works 3 days a week and makes $1000 per week.

Does this sound about right to you or is he in the minority? We would have to buy a car, but for $1000 a week that isn't the end of the world imo. What is your opinion?

I apologize if this has been asked or I missed something in the posts that could have answered my question, if so just let me know! Thanks!

Edit: Thanks for the heads up everyone. I'm pretty glad we didn't walk into that trap.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Peter Parker Miles Morales </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-01 11:46:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This has been bothering me a lot since the new rumors that the new Spider-man will not be white. That is not inherently what bothers me, what bothers me is that it implies Miles Morales could be the new Spider-man.

Miles' whole story is based in living in Peter's shadow. But on top of that, Peter Parker embodies everything that makes the name of Spider-man so incredible. He's lost his parents, his uncle who raised him, and his one true love. (For all of those that claim MJ is, read any comic in which Gwen is brought up. He is in love with MJ no doubt, but Gwen was pretty much his soul mate.) On top of that, he is incredibly poor and is under-appreciated and hated by much of NY (depending on the comic run).

Yet he keeps going. He never backs down and is always in good humor about it. He uses that humor as a shield to mask his tragic life. He fights everything from bank robbers to Galactus and never claims he is too good for the "lowly" stuff. Peter Park is Spider-man and deserves to have an MCU run. Only parts of him have been done faithfully in the past and I think he deserves a true run with people who know what Spider-man really stands for- to always keep moving forward. 

Sorry about the rant. I figured you guys could appreciate how I feel.

TL;DR Peter Parker deserves to keep being Spider-man in the MCU.  </TEXT>
