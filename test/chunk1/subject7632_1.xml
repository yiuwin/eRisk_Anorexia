	<TITLE> Mr Mime the only regional-exclusive with an evolutionary line? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-22 12:15:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not sure how the game will go forward with exclusives and I'm assuming Ditto is a regional-exclusive for Africa (for now) which means the number of total exclusives is 5. I was never entirely happy about this, because it means I'll miss out on 4 of the 5 regardless of where I live, unless I'm willing to travel.

I always thought they chose Pokmon without evolutions, but I recently realised that Mr. Mime is the only regional-exclusive that has an evolutionary line with the baby form: Mime Jr.

Is this fair? It means that non-Europeans may not be able to get Mime Jr. later on.

However, if they continue with regional-exclusives in each generation, that means each generation will probably have 5 Pokmon that will be region-locked. In this case, maybe for that generation (Gen IV), Mime Jr. will be Europe's exclusive again.

EDIT: I know trading will hopefully be coming out soon and this will probably solve most of the exclusive concerns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone heard anything about an official release date yet?
I'm not just looking forward to having the official Google Play app, I'm mostly just assuming that Ditto is exclusive to Africa and I can't wait to catch one.

Sidenote: I've been very active on r/pokemongo and r/thesilphroad (and admittedly, r/findingditto as well) but I didn't subscribe to a South African subreddit until now. I also found r/silphroadafrica earlier today.

Mods, can we get these related subreddits on the sidebar or something? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been scouring the internet for a while now, looking for any hint at an official release date.

Not just because I want the official Google Play app, but also because I'm pretty sure Ditto will be exclusive to Africa.

Is there anywhere we can get some sort of automated message / notification to tell us specifically about Africa news for Pokmon Go?

Otherwise, I'll just continue mulling about on Reddit until we hear more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, guys.

I've seen on a few other posts that people are wondering whether Ditto will be an Africa-exclusive.

I'm posting this here so people don't keep asking.

I live in South Africa and I've been playing since day 1.

There is NO Ditto here (yet).

But as soon as the game is officially released here, I will definitely update you guys on whether I (or anyone I know around here) finds a Ditto. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Tiny suggestion:

Not sure if this has been mentioned before (I tried searching a little) but I am quite strict with my items and I constantly discard Potions, Berries, etc to make sure that I have enough space for Pokballs (and Great Balls and Ultra Balls).

What annoys me is constantly checking whether I actually need to do this. If I'm not too close to my total, I don't need to discard anything. If I AM at the total, I don't get any items.

I would like to see my "current/max" (eg. 248/250) displayed when I swipe a Pokstop so that I know how close I am to max. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So it struck me as slightly odd that when YOU flee from a Pokmon, it remains on your map. Has anyone tried constantly fleeing from a Pokmon and examined it each time to see if anything changed?

Maybe the number of times that fills up your journal? (I don't know if fleeing shows in the journal)

Also, this could be tested with ONE Pokmon and also every single Pokmon in that list being a different spawn. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Guys, stop causing further problems for Niantic. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-01 11:30:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey, everyone. I know there's a million posts about this and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but by posting threats, loopholes and ways to screw Niantic over, you are NOT getting them to fix the game, you are causing them (and Pokmon Go) to possibly be SHUT DOWN.

Basically, what I'm saying is:
Complain and fight as much as you want, but if you want to formally complain and cause problems about everything and a million people are behind you, you ARE going to cause the end of Pokmon Go and I will hate all of you for it.

I know the game is not working 100% and you're all right to be upset about it. I totally agree. But showing people how to complain directly, get refunds and get Niantic into trouble is NOT helping. You are literally causing further delays for them and I am pretty sure you will NOT get any joy when an announcement is made stating that they are no longer developing or supporting the project because of public demand.

I, for one, am willing to understand people boycotting the app etc. But please don't rate it down and send it to hell for the rest of us that are willing to wait for the fixes while we continue to play.

EDIT: By no means am I defending Niantic and saying that they're completely in the right.

I fully agree that we need to get further communication from them. I am NOT disagreeing with that.

Niantic, now would be a great time to communicate more. Especially since app usage has apparently drastically dropped. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Everyone bitching here assumes that Niantic is reading every Reddit post and ignoring everything.

Can one mature person contact them formally and explain the situation, clearly laying out what issues people experience and what is expected?

Right now, 5000 people saying that Niantic must die is not helping anyone.

**Reason for this post:**

I was obsessed with The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth when it came out and the subreddit did exactly the same thing. Everyone complained and argued and when an unnecessary update was released, there was mass anger and frustration. One of the devs made a joke about it and got completely torn to shreds by the community who were up in arms about them not fixing everything. Similar to Pokmon Go, it needed a bunch of fixes because of bugs that make the game a little annoying but definitely NOT "unplayable" or anything to that extent. Anyway, the Binding of Isaac dev was horrified by the response he got and only then did he fully understand how upset everyone was and he then issued a full and in-depth apology explaining how they were working on issues, how he recently had a baby and didn't have much time to assist the team, etc etc.

Anyway, I don't expect any agreement or praise. I just think if a million people spam Niantic with hate mail, nobody knows what's going on and we get ignored.

Let's stop fighting with them and compile some kind of actual request for info where they can respond to everyone at once.

We all want this game to be even more awesome, right?

Help Niantic out so that we all win.

EDIT: I'm not asking to be the person to do any of this. I'm just suggesting something because I know some of the people on this subreddit will actually be happy to assist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, guys.

Not sure if this will help anyone at all, but I've got a Samsung and when my phone locks, the game stops running.

I set my display to still timeout after 30 seconds, but I set auto-lock to the last possible option, so it only locks after 30 minutes. This saves quite a bit of battery because the game still continues while the screen is blacked out. As long as I check it before 30 minutes is up.

Anyway, hope this helps at least one other person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I had a very stupid issue where every time I created a Window with a Header Screen and a Tab Screen, the Tab would be a tiny one-line-sized section at the bottom and this made it almost usable.
I checked all the Tab Screen's config and all the Windows config and couldn't get it right.
Thanks to a colleague, I found that the Window size only allowed a certain space for screens and the Header Screen took up most of that. When I decreased the Header Screen size, the Tab Screen had more space and displayed correctly.
Hope this helps someone. </TEXT>

I live in a small-ish apartment so the chair is literally a couple meters from where I was sitting in the lounge and I looked up immediately as I heard the sound. There were no other sounds around me at the time. My girlfriend is asleep in the room and I'm sitting alone now staring at the chairs.

	<TITLE> Fix for Pokemon: Type Wild </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-14 10:15:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey, guys.

* Firstly: Not specifically asking for any links or downloads.

* Secondly: If anyone knows a better subreddit for me to ask this, please tell me.

So I played the fan game Pokemon Type Wild a couple years ago and I thought it was amazing. Recently, I found it again and realised I barely played it.

However, I now cannot get it to work. I have Windows 8.1 now so maybe that's the reason. But if anyone else knows any fixes for this game, please help me out.

It crashes immediately after you open the game. It just force-closes as the window opens. It doesn't even show anything by that point.

I know you can probably get the same results from a MUGEN compilation, but I want the original Type Wild game (well, an English version if possible.)

Any ideas? </TEXT>

BEEP!

The room came into focus as I opened my eyes and I forced myself to breathe even though I knew I was going to die soon.

The man wearing the mask laughed a gruff laugh which vibrated through me.

My chest felt like it was on fire. Oh, that's right. It was on fire a few minutes ago.

I could see part of my stomach or liver or something through the large hole in my torso.

The masked man put down the latest instrument of torture. Something that looked like a small drill.

Instead, he picked up a thin blade.

"How about we make you less of a man?" he asked as he leaned towards my groin.

I don't know what happened next but I blacked out at least once and vomited twice because of the pain. And I knew I wouldn't even be able to piss myself again.

He laughed again and threw something at my face. Something that was shredded but I still recognised it as a piece of me. I looked away for a few seconds and calmed myself down as much as I could.

"Please... Please just let me go..." I begged.

He looked shocked. He heartily blurted out "Well, why the hell didn't you say so before? Here you go."

Unbelievably, he removed my restraints. Then he gave me a remote with one button on it. As he was leaving the room, he said
"You'll eventually die in this room. And you'll be reborn. Aren't you glad I gave you your freedom? HAHAHAHAHA!"

I cried again. I didn't think I had any tears left but I cried.
One of my legs was thrown against the wall in the corner of the room. Four of my fingers lay strewn around me. I could kill myself with- No. He took all his tools with him.

"Oh!" he added, as the door slowly closed behind him. "Make sure you press that button. It'll be so much fun."

I wiped the tears from my one remaining eye and looked around the room. There was nothing that could be worse than this.

I pressed the button and saw digital numbers appear on a little screen.


5...

The door opened!!

4...

Finally I was free!

3...

No. Wait. Something's wrong... I couldn't move. The room started fading away...

	<TITLE> MUGEN games closing mid-game with no error </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-09 18:08:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Not sure if anyone else has this problem. MUGEN games keep closing without any errors. I played The Black Heart recently (A free indie MUGEN game that I really like) but every time I think I'm making progress, the game suddenly closes in the middle of a match with no explanation and no error. This is very frustrating, because it obviously doesn't save your position in the game, so I have to start an Arcade game again next time I play.

I initially thought it was this game until I made my own MUGEN compilation of Pokemon characters and it did the same thing when I was playing arcade mode. None of the content of the games are similar so I can't figure out why this keeps happening.

Any ideas?

I have a Lenovo T540 with Windows 8.1

This doesn't happen with any other app or game. </TEXT>

Eventually he forgets about it.

Then one day, at work, while rushing around, he jogs past a beautiful woman and out of the corner of his eye, he notices that she has the same tattoo! He cannot believe his eyes.

I heard it randomly in the middle of a mix on the radio (5FM in South Africa, in case that helps, although I'm *relatively* sure it's not a South African song. Sounded pretty American... but I guess most rappers do.)

Anyway, the music in this song made me laugh uncontrollably for like a full minute and I vaguely remembered it today.
I THINK I heard this about between 1 and 3 years ago. Unfortunately, I have no idea whether it was an older song at the time.

Any ideas, good people of Reddit?

	<DATE> 2016-03-11 11:46:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Once, a few years ago, I watched a movie and I haven't been able to remember the name of it.

I don't remember any famous actors or actresses in it but I'm not good with that anyway, so I wouldn't know.

So here's what I remember. My memory isn't fantastic, so don't hold me to every single word. Okay, so this is more or less what I remember:

This kid is at some random school. He isn't really popular but one day, he finds some info on (I'm pretty sure) a tape recorder.

He listens to it and it basically tells him how he's following the system like an idiot and the staff is controlling them and they deserve better. He starts off small, asking some questions etc, then he ends up giving a speech or two and he starts some protests at school when students listen to him and they feel like they're not being treated correctly.
This gets worse and worse with the main guy finding more notes/audio tapes along the way. Eventually, the students break out into a full riot with the main guy keeping a couple close friends/schoolmates in the staff room upstairs with him while he shouts orders to the rest of the students in the school.

At some point, the students realise that things are getting out of hand and they start to back down from the plan. Main guy is very upset and suddenly turns on his classmates by holding them hostage in the room.

He gets caught and stopped by the staff and ends up breaking all the windows in the hallway in his anger.

The staff sit him down and show him the student records of the previous student that did exactly the same thing.

We realise that THIS is the student that has been giving main guy instructions and he also broke the windows, caused riots etc.

The movie ends with the main guy realising he was a complete idiot and led everyone astray.

EDIT: Thank you for your suggestions, everyone. Still haven't found the right movie yet, though. </TEXT>

On the way out, his colleagues tell him that the old lady won't be able to handle this news and may die from such a sudden change.

He assures them that he will break the news gently.

He gets to the lady's house and the intern reminds him that the woman is very frail and he should be careful not to kill her with such a shock.

Howard says he is fully aware of the situation and he won't let the woman get a shock.

He knocks on the door and as carefully as possible, he explains that the woman has won a large sum of money.

Not wanting her to stay on this incredible thought for too long, he asks what she thinks she would do with the money.

She says "Why, I have no need for this money at my age. I'll donate it to you."

Howard drops dead from shock. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have an S4 (i9500), running CyanogenMod 12.1-20160224-NIGHTLY

Is anyone else having this issue?

* When my battery dies, everything goes off etc. as expected.

* Then, I put my phone on charge, it goes into the charging only display so I power it up to start the phone again.

* But what happens is that the instant it starts up, it says "Powering off..." and it shuts down.
This only happens after my battery dies and I start it up again.

* After this happens, it starts up normally the second time but it wastes 2 minutes of my life every time. Quite annoyed.

My guess is that the phone is trying to shut down when the battery is low but it doesn't get to power off before the battery dies.

So when it does come back up, it continues from what it was doing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I've had this problem on regular Android Lollipop as well and it was one of the main reasons I swapped over to CM but after a few weeks of awesome performance, I was very disappointed to see this bug again.

So usually, you receive notifications and you can drop them down from the status bar to preview them.
However, sometimes when you actually CLICK or SWIPE AWAY one of them, the entire OS freezes up and in some cases, forces a restart.

Anyone else have this problem?

This is obviously one of the main things you do with your phone, so I am positive this will be a big issue for me.

	<TEXT> Hey, guys.

So I've got a Samsung Galaxy S4 (i9500) and I was using the Guest Network at a client where I'm based until further notice.

Before I changed over to CyanogenMod, (when I was on default Android) my normal Android browser popped up when I connected to the network here and asked me to sign in.
Then it showed me the relevant Login page where I could enter my details.

On CyanogenMod, however, it asks me to sign in and then it loads a page with a big lock on it. I am now unable to sign into this page.

I've found a temporary way around this by finding the exact redirect address and typing into my Chrome browser but it doesn't always work correctly.

Anyone having the same issue or know how to fix this?
I tried searching this but couldn't see anything exactly related. If it was posted before, I'd appreciate a link.

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Aether Boss and Item </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I saw an [Aether](http://newgrounds.wikia.com/wiki/Aether) boss in a modded picture once and I wondered:

Wouldn't Edmund actually want to add in the Aether monster as a boss and "Retractable Tongue" as an item?

* Aether Boss:

Something like a cross between Chub and Monstro. The tongue would be the main form of attack/transportation.



* **Retractable Tongue**

*I can taste the clouds*

It would pretty much work as How To Jump but maybe the Tongue could do damage when shot out? If used without a direction, maybe the tongue does a small melee attack?

For those that don't know, [Aether](http://newgrounds.wikia.com/wiki/Aether) is an older Edmund McMillen game. One of my favourites, actually. Much less stressful than BoI or Super Meat Boy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This would actually make me happy unlocking the co-op babies. Right now, I have no use for them as I never play multiplayer. I'm just doing it for the achievements. I'd even rather have this idea as the [Mega Satan](/spoiler) unlock for everyone instead of the [Mega Blast](/spoiler) item. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I played a Greed Mode run and used a Joker Card to unlock the Devil room. In the Devil room, I encountered Krampus and I swear this bastard just spammed his rotating Brimstones like 6 times and I don't even mind that he used them one after another, but each time, the second Brimstone starts before the first one finishes. [Naturally, I got hit a few times and died](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=556993790). I didn't think this was fair :(

You can even see in [my screenshot](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=556993790) that while the previous Brimstone is ending, he's about to shoot AGAIN.

Anyone else experience this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, developers, Edmund, Nicalis, etc.

Can we please slightly change the AI of enemies like [Gushers](http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Pacer#Gusher) and [Splashers](http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Pacer#Splasher) that fire shots at you before you're even aware that they spawned. 90% of the time I enter a room with these enemies, there's one near you and it fires a shot at you before you're even aware of the room properly. I don't mind if they fire at you straight away, but at least give us half a second more to react to this. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Strange sounds when entering shop (Normal Mode) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi, guys.

Tinfoil hat time again. Not sure if this is a really random bug but this is now the 3rd time I noticed this.

Playing normal mode and the first time I enter a shop room on the floor, there's a weird sound. It sounds like one of the enemies vomiting something. Like when the Mega Fatty boss is about to vomit but before the actual stream of bullets shoot out of him.

Has anyone else experienced this? I've noticed it on a previous run with (I think) Azazel. And now on another run with ???. Didn't pay much attention the first time, but this time, it was in The Depths, I think. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've been thinking. A lot of the strange rooms or weird situations have been happening in the Flooded Caves. Given that a lot of the enemies etc are blue (and because Hush itself always seemed like a drowned entity to me), I feel like there's a connection between Flooded Caves and Blue Womb. 

The reason I ask is because someone posted about moonlight appearing in his run https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/3rg4xb/found_something_i_did_not_notice_before_all_the/

And the empty black poop room. http://imgur.com/jFaqcVN

I know, I know. We created hype for nothing before, but it's not usual for someone to capitalize a word in a sentence for no reason, right? Might be a character-related joke, I guess.

	<TEXT> I've seen a lot of people shrugging off new items or trinkets as possible secrets because they already found out what the item/trinket does.

I just wanted to remind everyone that The Polaroid had the protection effect back then and yet it was still a way to get to a secret area and boss. Don't cross out Faded Polaroid, etc just because you know the function of them.

EDIT: Basically, still expect everything to be possibly linked to secret hunting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, guys.

Now that we're actually getting the achievement, can someone please confirm FOR A NEW RUN:

Does beating Womb II in 30 minutes unlock Blue Womb or does this unlock by beating Hush?

I still hope there's more to this floor than just the Hush fight.

Edit: Question applies to NEW runs only. If we got to Hush before the patch, the unlock just happens during the next run you play, regardless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it just me or does anyone else really hate the Leeches in the Satan boss fight?? I never die to Satan. I always run right into these things because they spawn 10cm in front of you while you're firing massive tears because you're powered up for the fight so even if you don't touch them, you one-hit them and they explode right next to you. Surely they can spawn at least a certain distance from you? http://steamcommunity.com/id/subject7632/screenshot/648876514430688014  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw that someone mentioned this as a possibility.
We beat Isaac 5 times to unlock The Polaroid / The Chest.
We beat Satan 5 times to unlock The Negative / Dark Room.
We probably beat Hush 5 times to unlock the third Mom drop? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I love randomly finding The Small Rock after destroying tinted rocks.
It makes me want to find tinted rocks.
Then, we know that the level-specific obstacles (urns, mushrooms, skulls, polyps) can also drop items like A Quarter, Ghost Baby etc.
What I would like is if the fire obstacles could also do this.
Like a tiny chance that putting out a fire gives you Pyromaniac or Fire Mind. Maybe the different coloured fires can even give different items. What do you guys think? </TEXT>
