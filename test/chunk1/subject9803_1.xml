	<TEXT> yah totally agree about the commentary, i've watched a video of his before thinking i'd learn something about the process, but its just him awkwardly bantering. whats the point of commentary if it adds nothing to the video. "i saw a movie and i painted it" doesn't really add anything insightful, think about the information that you have on this process that the average viewer doesn't have, and talk about that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well i'd like to start by saying i really like what you have going here. but since you asked for a crit, i'll try to give you some feedback.

1) the words ("gas", "ola__"): so this is just kind of something that bugs me but i feel that words/ letters are one of the easiest ways to make a print/ artpiece look amateurish. even though it is easy to put words in, doing them so they look good is much harder (esp in print where you are doing them in reverse). the print has this very elegant/ simple/ thought out line work, and then your words look like they were written by a 1st grader, which is distracting, not to mention a lot of times when you have words in a piece the viewer will often be drawn to those, because, well we've been trained to read things. it seems like those 2 objects are relitively trivial and not suppose to hold any more importance than the rest of the objects so why put words on them? is is essensial that we know thats a gas can, or that that is an Ola(y)? jar? if not i say don't worry about spelling it out.

2) Lines: So again, i really like your lineworks so far , i especially like the umbrella and the bike tire, but what your line work is missing is variation. use line weight and the etching process to your advantage, make some lines more pronounced to emphasis the focal points/ the difference foreground/backround and just make things pop more. 

also like haiku said, you could use aquatinting achieve more variation. 

3) composition: i usually don't like centralized compositions, but you've pulled it off nicely. i think you've created a nice balance between the clutter of the bottom, and a nice simple elegance on the top.

i could keep going but i think thats enough for now. all in all, nice work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Also, in that video the guy is cutting towards his other hand, and kind of towards his face. Don't do that unless you're very comfortable with carving. Those knives are sharp.

So problably 75% of the time I carve i cut toward my hand, i know its bad, and there was a fair bit of blood shed when i started carving, but i've probably only knicked myself once or twice in the last year.. that said, i absolutely hate watching other people carve when they cut toward themselves. it freaks me out.

	<TEXT> I mean if your worried about the work of revamping your site, there alot of things that can help you. I've been using a website called www.Weebly.com to host my site ( www.toddherzberg.com ) i'm not saying its the best out there, but its relitavely cheap (about $50 p/year) but its really simple to change, theres other sites like www.Bigcartel.com that is more based as a selling site, which seems better then what i have, but is more expensive. you could also look into having a flickr account to host your image so they are easier to flick through.

i know in general (expecially if your not a big web guy (like myself)) creating a website is a pain. but the problem is if you have a website that looks like it was created during the dawn of the internet, people will automatically assume that its old, out of date, and probably hasn't been updated since the first Bush was in office. which is a huge turn off and will probably result in people disregarding your site/work because of it. So if you want people to take your work professionally, represent it as so.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks for taking the time to check out my work, Colloquial was a project that took me 180 days to make (i made a print everyday for 6 months), probably another 3 weeks to do all the frames/ framing, and that entire show took about 2 days to hang, it was hands down the biggest project i ever undertook. i feel kind of weird about that project though, i really like how it turned out, i love the fact that it had this presence about it, it commanded the room, but i don't know if it was "me." I felt like it was more pretentious/ high brow than what i like to make. i think thats what draws me to printmaking in general, i feel like prints are art for the common people, and after being preached High art throughout my undergrad, when i got out i just wanted to make work that people could enjoy without having to push some super deep super meta concept behind it. But honestly, i'm sure thats just me being reactionary, pushing away from my old and i'll probably end up wanting to do a serious project after awhile of doing fun prints and skateboards.... sorry got off on a tangent.

so anyway... about your work. I don't know much about digital art, so i'll stick to the prints, I think the prints that stand out to me the most are your more traditional prints Haru, Fuji Blossom. Now this is just my opinion so take it or leave it, but I also feel like i've seen prints like this 1000000 times. I mean the prints well executed the chine colle is really well done, but its going to be hard to differentiate yourself from a crowd when you are making traditional work. I'm not saying to stop and abandonship AT ALL, you'd built a great toolbox of skill and print abilities, but what I think would be a good thing for you to try is taking this very traditional style and incorporate it into modern times. right now your work is missing some kind of tension, not saying that it needs drama, but i think that the juxtopostion of traditional style and modern subject could be interesting. 

http://i.imgur.com/kKO50zl.jpg

for example this person (don't know the name but its in the top 10 alltime of /r/art) forms this strange feeling taking the time to traditionally decorate a modern vessel.

all in all make the work you love to make, i think you could push your work and make yourself stand out from the crowd.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if you ask for an honest judgement on the internet (or anywhere) don't be surprised if its not 100% positive. hell, on reddit, my highest rated post on here it had over 4000 downvotes, which goes to show you can't make everyone happy.

that being said i think what 9pigs is getting at is that this seems more like a doodle in a notebook than it does a finished art piece. I'll give you some pointers 

1) documentation:  this looks like it was taken on an old ass camera phone in awful lighting, think about it, if you don't care enough to show us the best image of your work, why should we care about it? taking the time to take a good photo makes SOOOOOO much difference when viewing photos online. when showing your work on the internet, you want to be able to show a true, accurate portrayal of your work, if you don't have access to a lighting studio, try to use natural lighting when documenting your work

2) we're going to need more then just an abstract skeleton to get us excited. now i'm not saying what you have here isn't a bad start at all. Hes quite entertaining and fun. but if this is  more then just a doodle you drew to avoid taking biology notes, give me more. give me an atmosphere, give me a background, study a skeleton and push some of the details, add another figure/ object in and let them interact. I'm not saying that you have to make photo realistic at all, but it still needs more. consider the entire picture plane, even the negitive space (that areas that you didn't draw on) are part of the image and you should consider those as such. even lets say if you gave this a clearly defined flat background, it would seem like you gave more thought to the composition and final image, and the more thought it seems you gave the more we (the people of the internet care).

honestly man, just keep making, the more you keep drawing the better your going to get, and the more people will appreciate your work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> what volucine said.  all the areas that i carved are blow the surface of the board, so when you take a flat roller across the surface of the board the roller comes into contact with the surface of the board, since the carved areas are lower, the brayer simply rolls over them without touching them since they are lower then the surface of the board.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yah the brayer is like a firm rubber-ish roller, i tried to explain it in the album 

"the process that i'm using is much like relief printing. It works on a principal of raised and lowered areas. You have the surface of the board which is your raised area, and the areas that are carved away are you lowered areas. After you're done carving you'll ink up the board with a brayer, think of it like a rolling pin with ink. you roll over the board with the brayer, and the areas that haven't been carved come into contact the roller, and get inked up whereas the areas that have been carved away are lower and left untouched by the roller, so they remain ink free and white." </TEXT>

The most challenging part probably wasn't the physical carving (it was, more less akin to my lino carving) but the actual layout of the objects. there were many times where i wouldn't know what to put into an area, draw something, erase it, draw something else, erase it, etc until i'd just say F-it and carve whatever i had sketched out </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this is really nice, everything is so consistent and clean. in a print like this do you draw everything out before you start working, or do you sketch out the areas and kinda freehand the textures. 

 i especially like the line work in the stairs, rails and pillars. those areas remind me a lot of Tugboat Printshop. keep it up

	<TEXT> i really should, but i just braced it with one hand/leg and carved with the other, which resulted in quite a few issues (including quite a few injuries), especially carving on the ends of the board.

i'm talking with a guy to produce a limited run of them, otherwise selling the original boards would just be to expensive.
if it works out, i'll probably have a kickstarter to make that fly (which the backers would essentially just be preorders for boards) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> also, i was wondering if you guys could help me with picking a sealer. After inking these up, i'm letting them dry, but i want to cover it with a sealer to protect the ink/ wood. not knowing anything about sealing things, do you guys have any recommendations. the 2 surfaces are Canadian Maple and an oil based ink, i was thinking i should probably use some form of aerosol spray, just dunno what kind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So i've had a road bike for the last 2 years, and longed for some summer trail riding (which road tires obviously aren't to good at). So i was looking around online and was thinking my best bet would be a hardtail, since i'm not planning on starting out doing really intense riding (no 20 foot drops out of the gate). i guess my main question would be A) am i right about starting out with a hard tail in my price range ($500-800) B) 26 vs 29 C) any miscellaneous advice. also i've been looking around on craigslist for the last 3 weeks, hoping to find some steal but have no luck, so thinking i might need to buy a new(ish) bike.  </TEXT>
