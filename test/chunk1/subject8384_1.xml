	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Over a year ago I saw a series of videos on Youtube from a guy who was developing this extensive cockpit space simulator. I remember all the videos were still in a hanger and it had a blue hub. He was talking and showing a long time what is takes to start this one single ship.

I kinda lost focused of this projekt. Does anyone remember the name or know what i mean? I googled for hours but cant find it anymore. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So from one moment to another I heard a clicking sound coming from my computer and my computer started to slow down meaning it took forever to open the explorer and wouldnt even shut down or restart so I pressed the button on my pc to shut it down.

Then I wanted to boot it up again however it didnt work, right after the windows boot logo appeared a blue screen flashed for 1/10 of a second and the computer rebooted.

putting in the windows 7 dvd to recover doesnt really work since it takes literally forever to load and nothing happens when it loaded the Recovery UI. even when choosing to install a fresh windows 7 it just says "setup is starting" and nothing happens..

maybe my hard drive is broken? is there any way to recover the booting process?

	<TITLE> AMA Request: The guy who edited the new episodes (he is on reddit). </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-05-26 22:41:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just yesterday I saw a guy commenting on another topic that he actually edited the new season and tried to make it feel like the first three after watching them. After seeing many people complain about the editing I think it would be nice to have an AMA by him. I cant find his username because my browser history is emptied everyday so I am hoping he will see this.


Questions:

1. How did you get the job?

2. Why didnt they choose the old editor?

3. Why is the music sometimes so loud?

4. Do you feel like you did the best job you could or do you think you could have done more if they would have shot the episodes chronologically and not out of order to fit the actors schedules?

5. How long did it take to edit the episodes?

	<TITLE> I am very disappointed in Rockstar. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello there!

I have been a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto since the first game. I owned and played every single GTA there is. 
But what Rockstar did this time is very disappointing. I didnt expect them to do an "EA" move by having the standard edition an uncomplete game. I cant fly the blimp if I dont order the complete edition? Well fuck me. 

This is what real fans get having the release date pushed back? I mean having in-game stuff just in the complete and special editions is really fucking me up. I cant express how sad I am right now :( Not everybody can afford the 150 dollar edition (its probably gonna be even more expensive here in europe!)

PS: Sorry for my bad english. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved the game "Enemy Territory". It was a great massive multiplayer shooter where you had goals (for example get a tank to a location and blow something up). Also you had different classes like engineer who could repair the tank or snipers who could disguise themselves as the other team. I really miss games like this. Is it me or does it seem like all current games are just fast shooting (like Call of Duty for example). Please prove me wrong and sorry for my bad english. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> DJs of reddit, how do you organize your music library? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-24 12:12:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello there, I am a DJ / Producer from Germany and I find myself having trouble finding the best way to organize all of my music. I collected so much music over the years that it is getting out of control. First I just tried to put them into different genre folders (Hip Hop, House etc) but even they got too full. They I tried putting all the music in "date" folders (December 2011, January 2012) but even thats crappy. Hopefully some of you bigger DJs can help me out. 

How you you organize your music? 
What is your folder structure? 
Do you even have one? 
Do you still keep older music (few years old) on your harddrives even though you are mostly playing new stuff? </TEXT>
