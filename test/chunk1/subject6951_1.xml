	<TEXT> Thanks for helping! So you are saying that the enhanced recognition would make the recognition faster? I looked up Dragon 3.0 and I'm not sure if I'd be able to script it in applescript. Do you think I could? Have you tried the program I sent, is the response time from the program slow as well? </TEXT>
