	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This sounds really fun because anything can happen in one turn and there are some questions that comes to mind about this staple.

1. How did it start? 
2. How will you know that you'll be in a Multibattle free for all WiFi match? 
3. Since the game still recognizes it as a Multibattle using Multibattle rules, what if by chance the team on the other side has one Pokemon on each trainer   on your side there are no Pokemon left on each trainer. Who will be declared winner?

I'm loving this type of match. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just playing Pokemon Y doing things then I just got a Battle Invitation from an Acquaintance. Both of us have one Legendary in our team so we battled it out I won the battle. After that he made a Trade Request so I accepted it. I also figured I'd offer him my extra Eevee because I had a fun time doing a battle with him. When he saw that I was offering an Eevee he offered back a Snover named "Obamasnow" with an Abomasite even though I already have one, I accepted the offer. Somehow it feels good giving out awesome Pokemon to random people you just had a battle with. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-10-01 10:59:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all, my Phat PS3 went YLOD so why still PS3 and not PS4? Because I have around 10 games waiting to be played! The only games I'm waiting for the PS4 is Final Fantasy XV   Kingdom Hearts III.

Here's my PS3 dilemma... I've been hearing from a lot of people that the PS3 Slim is better than the Super Slim but the problem is the PS3 Slim isn't around anymore. Yes there are some stores here from where I am still selling a PS3 Slim but I'm hesitating because the gaming store, which sells the PS3 slim, is somehow not reliable unlike the gaming store that is being run by a known company from where I am which now sells only PS3 Super Slim so I'm choosing to go with that but...

***TL;DR: Here's my question. (especially for the PS3 Super Slim users) Did you encounter any hardware problems particularly heating problems?*** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Strike One: To get Peridot you need to Breed Crystal + Cactus that somehow gives you the chance of getting a Crystal Dragon.

Strike Two: To get Gold/Silver/Bronze Olympus you need Air + Quake that somehow gives you a chance on getting a Crystal Dragon.

Strike Three: Crystal Dragon breeds   incubates for a total of 48 hours   sells for only 100k Dragon Cash.

I have no problem with dragons on that category that breeds   incubates below 24 hours but man when I see 24 hours when trying to breed an Olympus and/or Peridot it somehow pisses me off.
