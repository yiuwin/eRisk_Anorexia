	<TEXT> My 22 yo girlfriend has a brain tumor and is currently undergoing chemo therapy. She lost weight extremely fast and I have asked her to eat healthy multiple times but it was already too late. Two days after I asked her to eat healthy she was hospitalized for anorexia. She has to stay in the hospital for maybe a week and after that I have to make sure she eats right. 
I am planning to have her eat more of the following:

   
 -Protein drinks (powdered protein supplement mixed with fruit, milk and/or yogurt)
   - Milk
   - Dairy products
   - Eggs
   - Meat
   - Sauces or gravies
   - Oil


I'm not sure how many calories I should have her eat. 2000 might be too much since she is a small girl. (1.60m)
We might send her to a dietician if it really is too hard to do it ourselves. (She doesn't have insurance so it's financially better not to.)
Any advice telling me how to deal with this situation and how I can best help her is appreciated. What food I should avoid to not make her vomit. What she can best eat to not make her anorexic anymore. Anything is helpful. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My girlfriend [22F] has a brain tumor and is allergic to the pills she gets. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Three weeks ago we got the news. She has a brain tumor and the doctors told her that it wasn't too late and it was still treatable. She got pills to reduce the tumor size. A week later we found out that the tumor had spread all over her left brain. It was worse than the doctors thought it was. The first type of pill she took made her nauseous and gave her a fever. She went to the hospital and was okay the next day. She got other pills but these did the same.
She has given up hope and I'm trying to convince her to take other pills. To keep seeing her doctor, but she still hasn't made up her mind. 
I was wondering if anyone on this forum is a doctor, or has any idea what could be done. She can still try chemo, but she is afraid she will be allergic to that as well. (is that possible?)
Please respond with your thoughts, this girl means the world to me.. </TEXT>
