	<TEXT> Take a look at the wedding invitation, if you can, or ask around. Most weddings have a suggested dress code. That should give you a starting point. It could be anything from black tie to beach casual. I usually recommend a full suit with a tie. I don't recommend wearing a vest without a jacket. </TEXT>
