	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I am rebuilding the Brooklyn Nets, and to make sure I have the number one pick (I traded for both of them back) I gave Brook Lopez and recently signed Lebron James 0 playing time. about 30 or so games into the season I get a message saying, "Brook Lopez was lost at sea and presumed dead." What does this mean? I started to give LeBron playing time in fear that might happen to him. I am confused. Could someone please explain this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Zach Lavine tore his bloody ACL so his potential should take a massive hit, along with this overall. Look what happened to Jabari Parker, he was the lading favorite to win rookie of the year, and now he is just Giannis' sidekick...

2. Myles Turner is not quite in the same league as Kristaps Porzingis, due to his lack of a long range jump shot. Although Myles finishes around the rim better, won't matchup to Porzingis until he develops that deadeye three point jump shot that Kristaps has. Here is a player to player comparison of their career totals in the regular season. http://imgur.com/a/aeWJX.

3. Now I do agree that Nikola Jokic should receive an increase, He is not that much better than Porzingod. The thing that Porzi has on most players similar to him is that they don't have that knockdown from anywhere three point shot that all centers in the NBA today need to have to get substantial playing time. Even players like DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis have had to develop it as a result of broken shoulders from carrying their teams (Even thought they play together now). A comparison from all three players shows that Porzi has more points per game. http://imgur.com/a/5HMCU. </TEXT>

He comes back with a spectacular return for some who shattered their knee, slashing 45.1/39.6/86.7 and contributing 22.6 points a night and 7.3 boards a game. He and Tobey lead the Nuggets to a 1st seed in the west, only to be bounced in the first round by the Suns' brooms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boy, do I have some stories to tell you guys. Woohoo! Damn this was an amazing year. So first off, Noah Matthews got drafted to the Miami Heat, but was then traded almost immediately to the Denver Nuggets. However, the Denver Nuggets selected Robert Tobey as a huge steal 3 picks later, who then went on to win MVP and ROY. Noah Matthews suffered from an injury riddled season, and missed a total of 20 games. Fortunately, he narrowly escaped a boating accident, on the contrary he tore his ACL and MCL in the process, meaning he will miss the entire 2020 season.

Bonus: Bennett Lyons was dissatisfied with  his personal outcome of the 2018 season. He worked herder than anybody else in that offseason. First one to practice last one to leave. He didn't have many friends. The only thing on his mind was getting better... and so he did. Although the team had a worse outcome on the season, missing the national tournament, Bennett Lyons developed better than anyone else on that team. He progressed his slashing from 43.2/30.4/84.1 and 7/4.5/2.6 to 49.7/41.6/89.8 and 13.7/5.6/3.8. Some say literally seconds after the buzzer sounded for the end of the National Tournament, he tweeted, "Next stop: NBA baby woohoo!!!" As the 2020 season approaches he is witing for his chance to shine but until then, we wait... </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After a less-than-mediocre freshman year at Northwestern University, Noah Matthews puts in a spectacular effort in the offseason. Going from playing just three games his freshman year, to leading his team to the conference tournaments, only to be bounced in the first round. However, it was not in vain. Noah finished the year slashing 18.1/5.9/1.9 and 53.2/46.4/90.7, because he jumped up to an astonishing 82 overall. He then finished the year by declaring for the 2018 NBA Draft.

Bonus: Bennett Lyons was not a child of many struggles. He was incredibly bright, athletic, and his movie star parents were extremely wealthy. He was a stellar athlete, competing in three separate sports for the three different trimesters, Fall, Winter, and Spring. Football, Basketball, and Baseball respectively. After receiving no baseball scholarships to any schools he wanted to go to, which were Duke, Clemson, and Northwestern, where his cousin went two years before and is now a top 20 NBA prospect for the 2018 NBA Draft. He decided to try and go a different way. It would be harder, but it might get him to one of the schools he wanted to go to. He tried to get on through a basketball scholarship. Sure enough, two weeks later he received the letter asking him if he would like to come to join Duke University's basketball team, only a half ride on the contrary. He wasn't worried about the other half, due to his parents incredible wealth. When he got there he was a walk on for baseball, but he got the scholarship for basketball, so he would be on the basketball team or his scholarship would be terminated. When he got their he realized Coach K's practices were tough. You had to work. To no one's suprise he developed into the star freshman that would be a great addition to the starting lineup. And so his freshman year began... </TEXT>

I need some name suggestions and other answers for position, physique, work ethic and as I mentioned before. There should be weekly updates on how his career is turning out. Every week I will simulate one year into the future of his career. I will also let you guys vote on what team he should sign with. Please follow me on his Journey. I also just thought of this: What if a big scandal happened in the middle of his career? This will be a mostly comment controlled career so I need as many comment as I can get. Thanks for the support! You guys vote on what team should draft as well. So first stop: General background of player, physique, personality, and college. Hope you all enjoy!!!  </TEXT>
