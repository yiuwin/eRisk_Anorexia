	<TEXT> Nobody has mentioned this One so camping.

Once you familiarice with the camping mechanic, medium dungeons become easier than short ones. Always bring lots of food if you have problems with stress, consuming 8 food when you camp will reduce the stress of each Hero by 10. Also, the -jester and the houndmaster have great combat skills to reduce stress, BUT, they have some of the best camping skills to reduce stress. The jester in particular can reduce someone stress by 45 if they are aflicted, and then him and the houndmaster can use their party stress reduce for -30 stress or so. If you combine al this by focusing and stunning the stress dealers you shouldnt have any problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It weren't graphics that made me think so, have you played "Lisa"? Its graphics are super cartonish on a first look, but the game... O man, the game...

What made me think that Ori and the Blind Forest is more beginner friendly ( I really think we should stick to this term) is that exploration is super simplified, you always know were to go and the "secrets" are not as "secret" when you have all of them marked in your map.

Also, the platforming isnt really that complex, its just trial and error, that can get frustrating, but thats It.

Not that it's a bad thing, just not my style, I prefer things like axiom verge. </TEXT>

This might be what you are looking for.
Just some general advice:

-Max w.

-Don't Play him adc until you have some experience, and always with a support with hard engage (Blitz, Leona...) I have found that morgana his pretty good too, locking enemies down with q and givnig you a sweet anty cc shield.

-Stormraiders and rylai's help you deal with kiting, but are not mandatory, you can skip them if you feel confident on catching the enemies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, people die in this game, even Max level heroes, learn to deal with it.

*TEAM BUILDING*

If a hero has some quirk such as (extra stress in weald, or, redyced accuracy in the ruins) dont take them there. If they have possitive quirks for that rea, try taking them there, but NEVER force a bad team composition just to take guys that are good in that place, team sinergy is always the number 1 priority in combat.

For a beginer your teams should look 
something like this:

Healer(generally Vestal)/ backline damage/ frontline damage/ tank.

Why? 

You need a healer because It can get people out of Death's door, in this game people only die if they have 0HP and they get hit (33% chance for them to die), if you heal them, even if its only 1 HP, they cant die in one hit.

You need someone who can hit the enemy backline (3rd and 4th red dots on a skill), because in Most combats they are the main damage/stress source, so you should really prioritice killing them. Grave robber/High way man are strongly recommended. Plague doctor/houndmaster can be super good, but It can be a bit hard for newcomers to use them properly

You also need to deal with the enemy frontliner, as most backline hitters (such as Grave robber) can have problems dealing with the frontline. A bounty Hunter/leper are good here, take into account that the leper has The most damage in the game but misses more than anyone else.

Frontline tanks should have a high Hp pool and some way of disrupting the enemies, generally stuns. Crusader and man at arms are good.

*PREPARING TO DUNGEONING*

An unprepared team is a dead team, always buy torches (you generally want to have 75-100 light), food (your character will suffers "hunger checks" and if you don't feed them they will suffers heavy damage) and shovels (when you find an obstacle, click the shovel icon to remive them). How many? Experiment. If you are bringing 6 torches and can always Sustain high light for the whole mission then you are good, if you have light problems, start buying more.

The other supplies (bandages, antidotes...) Can be used for things such as getting rid of bleed, healing debuffs... Etc, you shouldn't use them too much for these, if you are getting distroyed by enemy bleed, bring characters that can heal bleed with their combat skills. The main utility of these supplies are curious interaction.

*CURIO INTERACTIONS*

In dungeons, you will find curios, you have 3 options:

-Direct interaction: It can have possitive or negative outcomes, depending on the curio and a random chance. Some curios (boxes) are always good to interact, some are just awful and you shouldn't even consider touching them (books). Experiment to learn these things.

-Use a supply: You can consume a supply an tem, by dragging It into the empty square that appears when you click a curio, to see what It does. Generally, it will do nothing or have a positive outcome, if a certain tem works nicely with a certain curios, It will always work in that way. Experiment and learn.

Some curios have negative interactions with certain tems, and they are MUCH worse than those of Direct interactions. For example, do NOT, NEVER, EVER, put a torch on the red-orb-tentacle-altar, or risk a full party wipe.

-Ignore the curio. If you are afraid and want to Focus on... For example, killing a boss, its alright to ignore curios.

"DUNGEONING*

In dungeons, always have in mind your goal, not the quest goal, YOUR personal goal: Farming some gold to upgrade your guys without losing anyone, beating a hard boss, even if It means losing a Hero or two, etc.

If you can't fullfil YOUR goal, then retrat (White flag on left top side), and fuck the quest goal, seriously, dont risk losing your A team because your pride needs a handjob, don't.

*TRAPS*

Sometimes you will see a trap in the floor, Check which one of your guys has the highest trap disarm chance, get close to the trap (without steping on It), left-click on that guy, then left click the trap. You will get hit by some -traps anyways, and some will be invisible, but this will help you.


*COMBAT*

In combat target first the enemy backline, you want them dead as fast as posible. This is why aoe is generally bad in this game, you want the 3rd and 4th enemies dead in 1-3 turns. 

If you want to move/stun/bleed some enemy with your skills, always Check their resistence to those (just point them with the cursor and a box will show you their stats)

Stuns are invaluable because a stunned enemy is effectively dead for one turn.

Moving skills are more complex, for beginers, use them only if you want to put an enemy in range for a powerful attack.

Bleed and blight are the same, only that they have different names and are calculated individual, but mechanic-wise they are the same thing, each turn=X damage, generally for 3 turns. They are effective against armoured enemies (they have a stat called prot) because they resist Direct damage, but they cant reduce bleed/blight. When to use them? If a bleed/blight is going to "tick" 2-3 times before an enemy dies, they are generally more effective than Direct damage, even versus normal enemies, if the enemy has no prot and you can kill them fast, use Direct damage.

*STRESS*

Stress(White bar below Hp bar) is the most important concept in Darkest Dungeon, It shows how mentally damaged a Hero is. Heroes gain stress:

-Entering a Dungeon above their level.

-Just walking through dungeons(cant be avoided)

-Traps

-Interacting with certain curios

-Being hit by a critical strike (random, cant be avoided)

Certain enemy attacks (can be avoided killing them fast and stunning them)

If stress reaches 100, a character has a 75% chance of freaking out, they will yell at your other characters (making them more stressed), ignore your orders, refuse the be healed and be a general nuissance.

If It reaches 200, the character has a hearth attack, and their Hp drops to 0(Death's door), if It was already 0, they die instantly. If a character at 200 stress gains more stress, It has another hearth attack.


Stress can be reduced by:

-Criting an enemy (unreliable)

-Certain skills

-Camping (I'll explain that later)

-Stress relief activities (in Hamlet)

Remember that unlike health damage, stress damage is carried between dungeons.

*CAMPING*

If a Dungeons length is medium or long, you are given a especial supply called firecamp, (1 in medium, 2 in long). If you are in a room (not a corridor) you can right click this suply to activate the camping event. This will ALWAYS proc a hunger Check, and then you can use "camping skills".

Each Hero class has some posible camping skills, and each individual Hero will know how to use a bunch of them. You can use the survivalist in the Hamlet to teach them New camping skills (for a price). Each Hero can learn 7 camping skills, but can only have 4 of them available, before camping, always Check that your heroes have the skills you want to use enabled.

Each skills consumes a certain amount of "time", you have a total of 12 "time", use It wisely. You can heal Hp and stress, buff... After you have consumed the 12 time. Finish the camp by "resting" (just click in the "rest" box).

When you rest, 2 things can happen:

-Nothing: You can normally continue the Dungeon.
-Nighttime ambush: You are fucked. This will trigger a combat, light will be 0 for the whole combat (enemies will hit harder and stress more), and your hroes will start the combat in random positions, not the ones you chose. Certain camping skills prevent nighttime ambushes from happening, but cost a lot of "time".
Like many things in this game, this is a gamble, you decide if the risk is worth taking.


*HERO MANAGING*

You want your guys to be ready for everything, if someone has +50 stress after coming back from a Dungeon, you want to reduce It, or, if the Hero is some random low level you don't care about, dismiss them.

If a hero has a disease, cure him in the sanitorium. You can also remove negative quirks here, but the onlu One that you REALLY want to get rid of in the begining is "cleptomaniac" because the Hero will take part of the loot for himself.

Upgrade your stage coach to always have heroes ready, then you guild, to improve Hero skills (super important), and your armory to improvement equipment (pretty important), upgrading the tavern and abbey is suboptimal in the begining, same with the nomad wagon and the survivalist. The sanitorium is worth upgrading if you are removing a lot of negative quirks, but this is generally not advisable in the begining, as heroes die easily and your resources are very limited.

*TRINKETS*

You gain trinkets by completing quest goals,  in some combats, and buying them in the nomad wagon. Each character can have 2 trinkets equiped (you cant repeat a trinket in the same character).

If a character dies in a Dungeon, It will drop its trinkets and you will regain them after you finish the event that caused his/her death, (generally combat, but can be a hunger Check or a trap, or just bleeding to death). If your party gets wiped, you loose all the trinkets they were carrying.

There are 2 ways of using trinkets:

-Diminish weaknesses: If a character is super weak to moving skills because he/she cant reposicin fast (leper for example) you can give them trinkets that boost their move resistence. You can give accuracy trinkets to the leper, so that he doesn't miss as many hits, etc.

-Improve strenghts: Give your Grave robber damage and crit trinkets and enjoy as she anihilates the enemy ranks. Or just give every stun chance trinket to your Plague doctor to perma-stun both enemy backliners for 3 turns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So much this. "Easy games" or easy modes can help bring games to the great public, and theres nothing wrong about that. All these people who say that this games are "lesser experiences" often forget that they got into videogames thanks to beginer friendly games.

As a matter of fact, these Christmas I was looking at the steam sales and I saw Ori and the Blind Forest was 50% down. My first reaction was: "Meh, I heard this game is just a  metroidvania for kids with cute creatures" And then my little sister(age 16) who has NEVER played a videogame other than popular mobile games entered the room and was like: OMG OMG SO CUTE! What is that? A game? Can you buy It? 

Last week she finally finished tye game (yes, on easy mode). Now she is playing super Metroid and loving every second of It. Super, fucking, Metroid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Against ranged Champions my strategy is to Rush SV or zz'rot if they are ap, zz'rot if they are ad.

With the extra healing and defenses from SV you can pretty much ignore them. With zz'rot I push like a madman, you get lots of shield by doing It So they cant really punish you. Then place a zz'rot and just enjoy watching their tower get destroyed.

If you are struggling in a melee matchup... Git gud. Jax/fiora/garen/darius can be hard, Master yi is rarely picked but obnoxious (q to negate your third q, same with his w) and some people have problems with renekton and riven.

Treat gangplank as a melee matchup, defenses won't help you here, zz'rot will only make him farm serpents faster. Rylai's is generally good against him.

You have to change your trading pattern for every one of them. Things like not doing extended trades against Darius (5 bleed and you are dead), or activating your w and q before you start actually fighting against garen/riven/renekton, so they give you shield even though they cc you.

If you can't beat a melee try getting a Liandrys/Gunblade for first and second (in any order), the slow from rylai's means nothing if you cant trade with them.

I mainly Play him toplane, sometimes botlane (as dpc of course) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted to practice my english and I love Darkest Dungeons lore, so I made this, hope you have a good read!


Darkness surrounded us. Normal darkness was an absence of light, a hole in the world, but this... this thing was... alive, and guided by some terrible will, an unearthly mind.

We had heard the rummors of course, everyone had. Those who returned from the depths of the ancient manor didn't talk much about it, but the look in their eyes was more than enough to plant a seed of fear in the bravest of us.

But now, we weren't chatting in the relative safety of the tabern, we were fighting for our lives. Once and again, I shot with my gun to the thing that laid in front of us, a monster I couldn't understand, nor wished to. We have seen what such knowledge had done to a once wise man, now but a puppet of his own dark ambitions.

The thing fought back, using it's own body as a weapon and somehow filling our minds with horrific truths. I could hear my companions scream each time one of the terrifying blows struck, but bless my lucky star, I was untouched.

We did what we were born to, press on in the face of adversity, fight death with death, and suddenly, everything froze. There was us, and there was the thing. And somehow, we came to a realization, whoever stepped front next, would cease to exist. It was taunting us... calling us...

I panicked, this... this wasn't a fight, this monster was merely toying with us, like a condescendent teacher, testing us to satisfy it's morbid curiosity. And I knew this was my punishment. I remeber crying.

-That boy... that poor boy... how could I...?

An iron fist hit me and I fell to the ground. When I recomposed and looked, I saw that it hadn't been a cultist nor a bandit, it was him, always there, Reynauld.

-I'm sorry, I...

He stood quiet and lend me his hand. I held it and rose up. And only then he spoke.

-You fine, old friend?

-We can't do this, we can retreat if we...

He placed his right hand on my shoulder.

-Nothing can stop me from completing my holy mission.

-What!? No,... NO! You can't....!

-I can, and I must.

-No, you don't deserve this, you are the best man I...

-I thougth that you of all people would understand. Sebastian, Hannah, take care of him.

In the blink of an eye. I was inmobiliced my two pairs of arms, and couldn't move a single muscle. The only thing I could do was to stare at the eyes behind the helmet, and they stared back. I could see madness in them, and fear, but also a glimmer of hope, maybe they were the same thing.

-It was nice to meet you, don't give up.

He turned back to face his destiny and rose his trusty weapon, like he had done a thousand times, like he did in the old road where my fate changed forever. And somehow, in the darkest pitch of oblivion, his sword shone with the light of a million stars.

-UNHOLY FOULNESS! I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME!

And Reynauld was no more.

Anger filled our veins has we all three attacked together, a whirlwind of steel and flesh. The thing tried to defend itself, to cut and burn my arms, my body, my very soul, but nothing could stop our onslaught.

I felt Hannah striking back and forth, faster than lightning, and Sebastian trying to push me to protect me with his shield, but I was decided to finish this as it had started, with blood in my hands, metal clashing with metal.

And then, it happened again, the same feeling of doom hanging over my hearth. I heard a child cry for his mother, then silence and then, his voice: 

"Names Reynauld, and you better watch your mouth if you want me to help you out of that pit". 

This was it. In some faraway realm, Hannah and Sebastian called for me, but they weren't important. I stared at the thing, directy at its face, and saw everything; the good and the bad, the heroic and the despicable, light and dark. And I saw who I truly was. Finally, I was ready.

-No way out. Hmph. Let's do this.

And then it was darkness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love Mordekaiser, but for most players he feels clunky and boring, because most trades are either stat checks, or Mord getting kited to hell without being able to do nothing about It (for New players). Yeah, there are ways to avoid getting kited, but It requieres too much dedication. He doesn't have a clear role nor a standard build, newcomers have no fucking clue on how to build him. And the dragon ghost is just bullshit that Riot introduces to force ADC Mord. Together with is passive, is the perfect example of a "feast or famine" mechanic, you either get an op ghost and insta win the game (elder dragn Ghost IS a insta win) or you don't, no middle ground, and this was suppised to be a short response so I better stop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So for me Mordekaiser is this huge Abomination that gets his Power from the enemy, he is terrifying not only because he has that letal mace and indestructible armor, but also because your mere presence will make him more dangerous. His enemies should feel not only outclassed, but also they should know that the actively collaborated on the demises of their allies. Thats why I think he should be some kind of anti-kha zix, a teamfight monster that has to be taken down alone, to minimize the harm in case of defeat.

I created a rework some months ago, it was something like this:

Hp at lv 18: From 1800 (not sure) to 2200

Hp regen/second at lv 18: From 1,8 (I think) to 3'6

Movement speed: From 325 to 340

Armor: No idea, probably should be a bit higher than current

Magic resist: Same as armor

Bugs: From 178 to 20

Passive: Whenever he kills a Minion or hits a enemy champ he gains 5 "Souls", up to 100. Souls decay fast when out of combat.

Enemies in "cursed zones" take 40-200 (scaling with Champion level) +25% Ap  Magic damage per second.

Q:Mordekiasers Next basic attack has aditional range and deals Increased magic damage, if he hits a Minion/monster he gains Souls, if he hits a champion the cooldown gets reduced to 1-2 second (not sure which One, 2 seems better on paper)

Cost: 10-30 Souls (levels 1-5)

Soul gain: 20-60 Souls (levels 1-5)

Extra range: 50

Cooldown: 10-6 seconds

Damage: Something between the current 2nd and 3rd q hit.

W: Mordekaiser gets a shield of cursed metal, which protects him, the metal curses the land around mordekaiser, damaging anyone that gets into range based on his passive. The more Souls he has at the moment he casts the ability, the stronger the shield and the curse get. The damage will disappear if the shield gets destroyed

Cost: No cost

Damage range: 300 (always around Mordekaiser)

Cooldown: 12-8 seconds(starts when shield dissapears)

Strength: 1% Increased shield and damage per soul.

Duration: 6 seconds

Damage: Check passive

Shield: 80-200 base (levels 1-5)+ 30% ap+    8-12% additional hp (levels 1-5)

E: Mordekaiser drains the life force around him, damaging everything and gaining Souls per enemy champion, this life force accumulates around Mordekaiser, so the effects of the drain are reduced the closer the enemy is to mordekaiser. Mordekaiser is always the center of the drain.

Cooldown: Toogle, 4 seconds to put swap from on/off

Cost: No cost when deactivated, when activated, no cost for the first 2 seconds, then 10 Souls per second.

Range: 3 zones, divided by rings, first zone is 0-300 units from Morde, second one 300-600, third 600-900

Damage: 
First zone(0-300): No damage
Second zone: Check passive
Third zone: 

Passive damage  x  (1+(0-100)/100) (levels 1-5)

Souls gained for enemy champion (note, no soul gain for the first 2 seconds after activacin):

First zone: 0 souls
Second zone:5 souls
Third zone:10 souls

R: Mordekaiser uses all of the Souls he has to create a espectral copy of a enemy champion, which is sumoned behind Mordekaiser. The more Souls, the stronger the spectre will be. Mordekaiser gains some of the spectre stats. The spectre will benefit from any item the original had and all of ita effects. (GA included)

Cost: All Souls

Range: 700

Ghost duration: 15/30/45 seconds

Ghost stats: Attack/movement speed, same has original.
Ad/Ap/Hp: (50+(Souls/2))% of the original.

Mordekaiser stat gain: 30% Hp, Ad, Ap of the spectre (not the original)

First of all, no CC, no mobility. Mordekaiser is the true juggernaut, the perfect war machine, Death should be his only cc.
So I took elements from a lot of elements from many Champions, Renekton (passive), Fizz (q) sion (w) and have changes them to be more oriented to dps (I think Morde should be a dps champ, not a bursty one, I understand that not everybody shares this opinin). 

The old passive his just gone, I think It created too many balance problems. So I gave him more Sustain with more hp regen, deleting hp costs on abilities (which I think are a cool concept but not for Mordekaiser), and with his New w, which has an insane potential shield, but he has to either sacrifice his q on a Minion, losing the cooldown, or properly use his e in a Big teamfight, and only after the initial 2 seconds of no soul gain, and some time more for a decente shield, if he uses his r, he cant use his e to get a big shield for a while.

The drake is just gone, its a remanent of adc Mordekaiser, those were dark times for league, we should know better.
So in exchange he doesn't have to kill the target to get the Ghost, which is quite insane, but he will get a shitty Ghost unless a has many Souls, also, he will lose all of them, So unless he has a perfect escenario he is giving Up a lot of defensive and offensive Power.

All of his abilities are quite insane, but he has to really give something up to use them to their maximum power, not just New Rengo stile.

Champions who are in autoattack range or under the effects of his w, will never be affected by his e, So positioning is very important, you are either taking insane damage, or giving him shouls, never both (soul gain for autoing champs is neglectable)

So in teamfights he would want to use his e to gain souls, but his enemies have 2 second of warning, in case they chlse to fights, all ranged Champions (except things like xerath, ziggs and jhin) will give him a lot of Souls to Play with, while melees will get chunked down by q spam. He only needs 2 enemies in the third ring and 1 in the second to infinitely q spam and Sustain his e, So things can go wrong really bad for the enemy team if they fuck up their positioning.

However, if he gets picked by a champion like Nocturne when he has no Souls, he will get destroyed, has he has no way of scaling. He cant carelessly splitpush (unless he has a strong Ghost), remember, teamfight Monster, not duelist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another snail here, 150 weeks, most Champion bosses done, VVulf is still running around and haven't entered The Darkest Dungeon.
So, yeah, as everybody has said, party composition is key in Champion dungeons, what I take into account when building a team is "how is the enemy going to fuck me Up?" "What could go wrong?". As an example, I'll write down my favourite party, so you can test It and see why your teams aren't working. However, take into account that this team has been built around the cove, and could get easily wiped out in a Champion level weald/warrens, and possibly ruins, It also sucks against the cove bosses, use It only on normal missions.

Rank 4

Plague doctor:

Skills: Single target blight, aoe backline blight, aoe backline stun, heal.

Trinkets: +20% blight, then stun chance. Blasphemous vial covers both and gives some delicious accuracy. Stack as much stun chance as you can.

Quircks: Whatever that gives her speed is good, accuracy is fine for the ocasional madman, reduced stress is great.

Role: Destroy the backline with your blight, blow them Up, if they are already blighted you can stun them, if you already stuned them with another character and they have the +40% stun resist don't worry, cove enemies have super low stun resist, she will easily overcome it, if they are still stuned stack more blight. Afterwars look for bleeds to heal, if there isn't any Plague grenade to the face of the frontliner. Always heal people out of Death's door, DON'T doubt, Death's door is ALWAYS the number One priority. Heal them at the first chance, always.

Rank 3

Vestal:

Skills: Heal, AoE Heal, Judment (the hit with a self heal), the stun.

Trinkets: Increased healing, all of it. Sacred scroll reduces stun chance but is good, take It if you can.

Quircks: Preference, I love scouting chance, but everything works.

Role: If you have a enemy with 60 or less stun resist on range, stun It, your stun has 109% chance with sacred scroll, if you can't do this, hit stress dealers with Judment, if there are no stress dealers or they are about to die because of blight, heal. If you can't heal, hit enemies with Judment. If you wnat to use the stun to increase the Torchlight instead of hitting thats fine. Always get people out of Death's door.

Rank 2

Crusader:

Skills: Smite, Stun, Holy lance, Inspiring cry.

Trinkets: +40% stun chance trinket, then Preference, I like tankiness.

Quircks: Preference.

Role: Stun things, If stress his high or you can't stun, stress heal, always prioritice the one with higher stress. If you get moved back Holy lance. Only use smite in One of the following: Nothing else to do/ You encountered a thrall (fat zombi). The thrall recibes more damage from smite because unholy, ALWAYS Focus the thrall first, stun him with the MaA (Next character) then just make sure the motherfucker is dead, DON'T give him half a chance to make a single move, a bad speed roll can fuck you, Focus him down inmediately. Get people out of Death's door with Inspiring cry, always.

Rank 1

Man at Arms:

Skills: Crush, Rampart (stun with move), Bolster (the speed buff, the dodge buff is nice but unnecesary), guard.

Trinkets: The +40% mive and stun shield is glorious, then Preference (i like tankiness here too)

Quircks: Preference

Role: Stun in this order: thrall, stress dealers, enemy who is guarding a stress dealer, piraa, guarding enemy, jellyfish, whatever you prefer. If someone is in danger guard him, if you can't stun and everyone is safe, see if you can hit a stress dealer or KILL another type of enemy, if none of this is available, use Bolster to buff speed, if it has been used at least once, yoy can re-use It again or stun a enemy (they have probably lost the stun resist). If everybody is safe, Bolster has been used and no enemy can be stuned, you can use Crush.

When to camp: Only camp when One of these happens: Stress is above 50 for more than 2 people, Hp is lower than 50% for 2 or more people, you got a disease than will destroy your run, you finished the Dungeon and want to camp for some free stress healing.

Camping: Make sure  you use One skill that prevents nightime ambushes, with this team the 4 time points are not worth the risk because their camping is not that great, as the MaAs damage buffs are almost useless. The vestal and the crusader can prevents the ambush, the Plague doctor NEEDS both disease curing skills, always use them if someone is sick, after both are done, Preference, I like stress healing has much as I can then using the vestals proteccin buff.

Stalling:

This party is great for stalling, which consists on just healing your team or stuning the enemy, without killing them, these are some enemies you can use stalling with: Uca savage (Big crabs). Yes, you read correctly, you can stall Uca savages, their damage is super low, nothing the vestal cant solve in a single turn, their bleed isn't dangerous at all because you have a Plague doctor, the Man at arms can stun him or buff dodge, and the crusader Will just heal any stress you have. When you encounter an Uca, always kill the backline first, then stall and fully heal, even stress damage. Any combination of two of the following can be stalled: Cultist brawler, Guarding enemies (some day I'll learn their name), Jelly, Snails, Bandit musqueteer (if you can keep him in rank 1). Any other enemy will deal to much damage (be It heal or stress damage) to reliably stall.

How do I Deal with...:

Colector: Stun him at first chance, stack blight on him, stun any HWM head, stun MaA heads if they guard the collector, let the Plague doctor just stack blight on him, Vestal can hit him too if everyone is full hp.

Ghoul: Stun with crusader, stun his backline with MaA and Vestal (the MaA will usually go first and move the third enemy backwards so the vestal can stun the fourth), blight them both. When he is alone stack blight on him, hit him with crusader (he is unholy) and stun with MaA, have the vestal heal everyone just in case a crit rend happens, if everybody is full hp you van hit him.

Shambler: Dont use the goddam altar, Dont do dark runs. Thats all, easiest miniboss ever. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First, this is my first post, suggestions to make it better are welcomed.

So, the upcoming dlc will bring a new wandering boss, called "The fanatic", a madman who will hunt "corrupted" heroes. I just think I found out his origin, I don't know if a similar post has already been made, if it has, I'm sorry. Now let's start SCIENCE.

Let's put together everything we know about him on a list, shall we?:

-He is nuts

-Seeks to "purge" the world from evil

-Has a mace

-Uses a magic fire or torch in combat

-His mace has a giant "V" on it

-Possibly linked to religion

Alright, now lets read a piece of the wiki, which can also be found ingame:

A Trampled Journal

A Trampled Journal 1/4
Sebastians watch was his last. We were jolted during our evenings repast, the best we could make in these murky halls of our once great house, from the roar and flash of black powder. We dropped our bowls and hurried to him. All we could find was his spent pistol and a trail of blood leading into a maze of shadows. We press on.

A Trampled Journal 2/4
We fought in the East Gallery, filled with portraits of our ancient lineage, uncaring witnesses to the slaughter. Alhazred, the fiery heartbeat of our retinue, wrought keen havoc in our enemys ranks. I keenly feel his absence even as I remember voiding myself upon seeing his lifeless body fall, blood pouring from his screaming mouth, some cruel knife having rent his lungs to gore. Yet we were victorious, and thus we press on.

A Trampled Journal 3/4
Hewell, dear friend, exemplary warrior, a survivor of the Kings wars, and many sorties in these halls, met an ignoble end. We were weary, Hewell and I, as we searched for sanctuary. Weariness, it appears, has a murderous streak: it blinded him to the mechanism that tripped the spikes which eviscerated him. I held him as his essence slipped away, another giant fallen in our mad pursuit. I am alone now, weary, but unbowed. I press on.

A Trampled Journal 4/4
I AM BECOME VENGEANCE! All cultists will feel my mace, brigands fear my roar! I am outnumbered, tis true - I am starved and half-mad, but as long as there is breath in my body, I will press on. I will wreak unbearable agony on those who would seek to despoil my great manse! And now they come! I dowse my torch. I DO NOT FEAR THE DARKNESS! THIS IS MY HOUSE, AND WOE TO THE UNINVITED!

So the writer of the journal (always wanted to make a Gravity Falls reference in a DD post):

-Is nuts (page 4)

-Has a mace (page 4)

-Has a torch (page 4)

-Hates cultists/undead/evil and seeks to slay them (page 4)

-Is, in is own words, "Vengeance" which could be related to a certain V (page 4)

-Lost all his friends in the ruins, which are filled with religious objects (pages 2 and 3)

It fits quite nicely, doesn't it? </TEXT>
