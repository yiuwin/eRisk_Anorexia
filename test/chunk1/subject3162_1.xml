	<TEXT> Thank you for your advice :) I took a promethazine a little after I posted this but the nausea is still coming and going so I took a small dose of emetrol too. Plus I've been drinking tons of water. I've heard some people say if its affecting my bowels mostly then its probably past making me vomit, I really hope that's true.

	<TEXT> Sorry in advance for the long post, I just need to vent. 
So, for the past 3 or 4 weeks I have been doing AWESOME. Like, I couldn't believe myself in how I have been feeling and acting. I have been going out and doing much more, spending time down at my in-laws, eating things I haven't cooked and eaten at places other than home and not thinking twice about it, I have BARELY take any anti-emetics, my anxiety and the little voices in the back of my mind have been much quieter, and I have actually felt physically decent (I suffer from endometriosis and IBS so that's actually a huge feat for me). Well, I woke up today and I was feeling okay. Went about my day, cleaned the house, ran a couple errands, etc. But I've been having some bathroom issues today (frequency, urgency, cramping, overall feeling a little cruddy) but I didn't let it bother me too much as this is not out of the norm for anyone who suffers from IBS. A couple hours ago I started feeling a little nauseous and feverish and suddenly my anxiety, fears, depression, everything, just rushed back to me and I feel like this is it. Like, I was doing so well, I've been so happy for almost a month now and everything was great then I started feeling a little crappy and I just want to curl up in a ball and die. I should mention that I sometimes run low-grade fevers in conjunction with my endo and flare-ups of IBS. I've had tons of scans, ultrasounds, blood work, etc. to rule out cancers or anything of that sort. My fever has only gotten up to 99.9 but I took some Tylenol and I think it's starting to go down a little bit. But I'm just terrified that maybe I've caught something and it's going to make me ill and I'll be sucked back into my vicious cycle of not leaving the house, not eating, just being a recluse. There's been quite a bit of crap going around here but I haven't been around anyone who has been ill, but I have been to the store quite a bit. I just see how people who have been ill handle it and it's like no big deal to them. They just let it run it's course and it's like it never happened. I wish I could be like that. 
I'm just scared and never know when it's just one of my flare-ups that needs to run it's course or if I'm coming down with something, but I'm going to be on complete edge and a wreck for the next couple of days. Bye-bye, progress. It was nice while it lasted :(
Edit: I should also mention I have kidney stones in both of my kidneys that cause fevers, nausea, pain, and a general crappy feeling also. So its very hard to tell whether its one of my conditions or if I've caught something. Anyone know a way I could tell?  </TEXT>

I know some girls on here mentioned that they knew lesions on or near your sciatic nerve could cause it. I hate pain killers so ibuprofen, my heating pad, and hot baths help me. Laying or sitting makes it worse too for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was on trileptal for 7 years and had no side effects, surprisingly. It was the only med I had ever taken that balanced me out pretty well. But, like with any medication, hives sound like maybe some type of allergic reaction. Your best bet is to get a hold of your pdoc like DrewciferCDXX suggested and go from there :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with thenameismg. I too have taken amoxicillin periodically since I was a child (I'll be 23 in a couple weeks) and have never had issues with it. Just make sure to eat with any antibiotic, or any medicine really. It helps a ton :) Don't stress yourself out too bad, only makes you feel worse while being sick. Eat something, take one, and just relax and distract yourself. You're gonna be fine :) I hope you feel better soon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had this problem numerous times, once being last Christmas with that nasty URI that also came with vomiting and diarrhea. I caught it cause no one would respect me, nor my mother whom is terminally ill, enough to stay away while sick. Ever since then I have made it very clear that if you show up and are sick, you will be asked to leave immediately. End of discussion. Your friend might be upset with you right now, but you were not in the wrong. She will get over it. Even people I know who do not have this phobia act and feel the way we do when it comes to someone so nonchalantly spreading germs or showing up somewhere sick. Just enjoy your weekend and relax, she'll get over it :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree with Yddie. I developed anorexia due to this fear, dropped down to 104lbs. and almost had a cardiac arrest at 22. I say the same thing that you do (actually said it in my first post on this sub) about never having to eat. But I realized I was going to die and that I needed to take control of my life. I actually started cooking and baking quite a bit, so of course I got to the point of wanting to try the things I made, or at least taste it. I also have a thermometer and it helps a ton. I have a lot less anxiety about food and eating when I'm the one who prepared it. Its also kind of a stress reliever and the only thing I found in really good at. I truly know how bad this fear is but you need food, that's not going to change unfortunately. So try to enjoy it a little bit. Instead of going out to a fancy restaurant with your boyfriend, pick a nice recipe you'd like to try and make it yourself. That way you know for sure its cooked properly and your anxiety might ease up quite a bit. Don't give up or frustrate yourself too much, you can do this :) Just gotta find what helps you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have wanted to ask this but couldn't bring myself to. Still a little hesitant about posting this but oh well.
I have been with my fiancee for about 8 years now and that topic has come up numerous times throughout the years, and we have actually tried a few times but for some reason, it hurt like you wouldn't believe. Like, I felt like something was ripping me from the inside out and I became terrified it was all going to get messy from there (I'm sure you know what I mean). So, about two or three weeks ago, we approached the idea again and I was super hesitant. I figured why not try again, but maybe a different position or something. So we tried a different position and it was uncomfortable at first, but nothing like what had happened before. Now if I hadn't been feeling my best that day (no pain, diarrhea, bloating, etc.), I wouldn't have tried it. But that day was a good day so I went with it. I wouldn't even think about it if I weren't feeling decent. Plus, there were no repercussions (or mess) afterwards. 
I guess my point is, you never know until you try. You might just need to find a position that works for you. Everyone is different. Also, plenty of lube :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live with my Mom and fiancee, so if I'm having a hard time with it, they tend to it for me. We have two cats and my Saint Bernard, who is basically my child. But our one cat is prone to getting sick quite often, she's been sickly all her life, and when it happens she makes this god awful screeching sound and paces then gets sick :( It's horrible and sends me into freak out mode every time. But looking back, I think comforting them and cuddling them after all was said and done may have always helped me. I think mainly cause I'm not scared of catching something like from them like I would be compared to a person who had just gotten sick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello and sorry in advance for the long winded post, but I have suffered from severe emetophobia for over a year now and I honestly thought I was alone or crazy. 
Over a year ago, I developed a hyperactive thyroid and along with it came massive digestive issues. For a while my doctors had no idea what was going with me until they found (benign) nodules on thyroid. I also developed tachycardia, which paired with my anxiety is just a mess. I have always had an irrational fear of getting sick, for as long as I can remember. The meds they gave me tore up my stomach and in the end, I developed anorexia because I was so terrified of food and even eating a saltine cracker or sipping on broth, set my stomach off which set off hours long anxiety attacks. I stopped eating for over 3 weeks, no I am not exaggerating. I lived off of ice water, Sprite, and my medications. I messed up my digestive system pretty badly and ended up with metabolic acidosis and hospitalized twice. This all happened because I thought if I ate, I was going to get sick. I was in a constant state of nausea, even though I was taking phenergan and zofran. I dropped down to 104lbs. and almost had a cardiac arrest at 22. 
I could not leave my house whatsoever for the fear of catching some kind of stomach bug and the fear that I was going to get sick somewhere if I left my house. I became a recluse and went into a state of severe depression. I finally woke up one day and realized if I wanted to live, and live a (somewhat) functional life, that I had to conquer this fear. I started slowly forcing myself on the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) and even though it made me nauseous, I held it down and slowly started feeling a bit better. I started trying to venture out of the house (hand sanitizer in tow) and tried to regain some sense of normalcy. The anxiety/panic attacks became less frequent and the thought of food or feeling ill wasn't on my mind as much.
 I kind of developed selective eating disorder because when I ate a food and it didn't make me feel sick, I felt in my mind, that was a safe food. So for weeks I'd just eat that food but oddly enough, I'd get a craving for something and just say screw it, I'll try it, and I did. Low and behold, I didn't get sick. 
It's a year later and I'm up to 120 pounds, still have some heart and digestive issues and yes, I still do suffer from emetophobia, but it doesn't rule my life like it did. I literally lost close a year of my life to this phobia. I still suffer from nausea, fear of foods, catching a stomach bug, etc. on a daily basis but I've learned that freaking out about it and constantly thinking about it, only exacerbates it more. I constantly chew peppermint gum cause I found out it kind of helps nausea, so now I am a gum fiend.
Thank you for reading my long post but I was ecstatic when I found this sub. I finally realize I am not alone, nor am I crazy! It's such a battle but with time, support, encouragement, and a lot of practice, it can be managed. I just wanted to share my story in hopes that it might shed some light on how severe this phobia can really be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had this issue after my thyroid shit out on me about a year ago. It messed up my digestive system so badly that I had metabolic acidosis twice. It became so bad that I literally had a breakdown, gave up on life, quit eating for 3 1/2 weeks, and gave myself refeeding syndrome. Once I got out of the hospital, I literally only ate steamed carrots and boiled chicken breast, cause it was the only thing in my memory that hadn't made me sick yet. Even one bite of anything else, in my mind, was going to make me sick. So when I did try anything else, I freaked out and ended up sick from anxiety. I eventually had to force myself to at least try and eat other things, and the more I kept my mind distracted from what I was eating or just had eaten, the easier it became. It slowly turned into one month all I'd eat was beef and noodles, next month breaded chicken patties and french fries, etc. In my mind, those were my safe foods at that moment in time and everything else was going to make sick, even the thought or smell of something else made me ill.  Without the understanding and support of my mom and fiancee, I wouldn't have been able to overcome it. In the end, it was mostly psychological but that doesn't mean I could help it. He's lucky to have someone like you who cares so much to go out of your way to help him. Its possible to overcome, just doesn't happen easily or quickly. Wish I had some helpful advice, best of luck.  </TEXT>

I have been sick for about a year now with numerous random things, mainly my thyroid and heart, and have been hospitalized 3 or 4 times so I missed my baby like crazy but when I got home he just laid in bed next to me and kept me company. They are the best companions and so sensitive to everything that goes on around them. But I hope your surgery does you some good, I can't imagine the pain. At least you got to come home and can sleep in your own bed instead of those stupid hospital beds haha :) </TEXT>
