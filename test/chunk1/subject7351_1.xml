	<TEXT> also, i had a few good question to ask him lined up but he didnt even give me the chance to ask them, he said at the end "this is the point where you generally ask me for advice but seen as though ive already you lots i dont think there's anything more to ask or say" something very close to those lines, then he ended the interview  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> that would have been a great question to ask, shame i didnt think about it, i think i was just taken aback by how much he seemed to be personally near like attacking my appearence, half of that outfit was from my last retail job that i didnt even have to pay for, its hard to afford stuff on 57 a week, the problem is i'd think asking that question comes across rude and presumptuous and most probably wouldnt ask it even if it was right in the situation   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i dont think he even gave me a chance with my attitude, pretty much as soon as he guided me into his office he started talking about my outfit as soon as he got off the phone, and pretty much all the way through he kept asking me why doesnt it look better, why does it look so messy and only a few questions about what i do what i enjoy doing why i want the job etc </TEXT>
