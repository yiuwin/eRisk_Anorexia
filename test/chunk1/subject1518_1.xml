	<TEXT> I just have a lot of self hatred and depriving myself of the essentials for life (food, water, sleep) seemed like a good place to start. I'm in therapy, some stuff has changed but I refuse to give up my ED. Seriously, as fucked up as it sounds, if I didn't have my ED to obsess over, my mind would probably drift back into the dark suicidal thoughts again. Granted, having an ED is basically a slow form of suicide, but I was never one for embracing logic and don't really care anymore at this point. I tell myself I'll stop when I get to my goal weight, but I no longer have a goal weight other than invisible lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also went through a bout of keto rash, between and under my boobs, and on my upper chest. I read on one of the keto groups to try washing the area with Blue Selson (the dandruff shampoo) a couple times a day, let the area dry SUPER thoroughly, and then apply calamine lotion. It worked for me. I haven't increased my carb intake at all, or my caloric intake, and the rash is gone now. I still use the Blue Selson every day though, just as a precaution.

	<TEXT> Yes. My ED started out as less of a weight thing (though I was fat and hated myself for it) and more of a self punishment thing. The more I deprive myself, the more satisfaction I get from it. Then as it developed into a fullblown ED, loss became the obsession. I use feelings as an excuse to rationalize not eating. Sad? Mad? Lonely? Anxious? My brain says "Just don't eat today.  *You'll find solace in your hunger.* Or if I'm disgusted with myself for one of 7 million reasons, " You don't *deserve* to eat today." 

I also find it comforting to obsess over food - safe foods, calories, numbers in general. It's a great distraction to avoid dealing with whatever emotions I'm trying to avoid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it's starting to become annoying. Like the other day I ran into a girl I used to work with and her husband and she says "Hey skinny." And then slaps her husband on the shoulder and says "Remember how big she was?" I was mortified, and then angry.

And then the other day a customer came into work and called me anorexic. I was like, um. Okay thanks, you curly headed fuck. LOL. Because I asked *your* opinion. 

At first I appreciated the validation because I have a pretty serious case of body dysmorphia so to me, I'm not skinny. I'm still the obese person I was. But I don't need anyone else telling me what they think anymore, especially when they say it in ways that exacerbate my body anxiety.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get it. I can relate to a lot of what you said. I do have a few friends but I'm an asshole who sometimes wants to withdraw from everyone and live in my own little world and so I lose the friends I went through the trouble of making by shutting them out. Or I cling too tightly to them and weird them out. Only a handful of people have stuck by me through all of my weirdness and moodiness, so I have issues with trusting people enough to really let them know too much of me. I'm essentially a disaster. But hey, if that's something you want in your life, my inbox is open. I hear I'm pretty funny if you catch me on a good day!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. I've lost 80 lbs since March or April. I obviously had weight to lose back then but now I am underweight and it's affecting my health and I still can't make myself eat like a normal person. I have always been prone to self harm/self destruction, but this has taken on a life of it's own. In a weird way, it has become my coping mechanism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry you're having a hard time. 20 days is a great accomplishment, try to focus on how awesome that is. I know, easier said than done, but don't let a bad couple of days ruin all that hard work. Did you reschedule your CBT appt? I know it's probably not what you want to hear, but you should probably go. 

I hope tomorrow is better. Hang in there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been 16 years, and I still think I see him sometimes. I've moved to a different city, don't have my information published, ceased contact with any mutual friends, and rarely go back to visit friends I left behind in that area. But, it never goes away. He tried to kill me, almost succeeded. I will probably never be 100% secure feeling, but it doesn't control my every move anymore, so there is that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't look at myself anymore than I have to. I developed an eating disorder because I hate myself, both inside and out, and don't feel like I deserve to eat. (Yay, brain!) I've lost over 80 lbs and I still see the same thing when I look in the mirror, even though now people tell me I'm too skinny.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But what really makes it worse is how it wasn't always like this. I wasn't always the sad fool I am today. I was happy once.

Ugh, I so get that. I have memories of being so social, I literally couldn't be still because I always had things to do, people to hang with, and just loads of fun. But now, I'm so self isolated that the most social activity I have is posting on Reddit and talking to the couple of friends I've held onto on Messenger.

This is not how envisioned my life, but I am holding onto hope that eventually therapy and medications will help me be more than this pseudo-human I've been living as.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Better luck this week. Sorry about your phone. I think shitty days are going around! 

And in the spirit of accountability posting - I managed three consecutive days of eating 1,000 calories Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Given that the past month has consisted of 500 or less (usually less if I'm being 100% honest) days, I'm feeling like that's a pretty big accomplishment. I feel like a bloated whale carcass today, but I'm trying not to obsess over it too much.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get it. I am stuck in this cycle of overworking myself to exhaustion because empty time is too hard to deal with, and I don't feel like bothering the few people I have in my life anymore so I have to stay busy. So, I wake up, shower, go to work, eat something at some point if I feel like it, walk my dogs, go back to work til I can no longer stand, come home, take sleeping pills, maybe sleep/maybe not. Wake up, rinse and repeat ad nauseam. 

It's not a very happy life right now, but it's getting me by. 

Also, "Everyday Is Exactly The Same" is such a great song! I love NIN.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use a collar and a harness as back up. (I'm paranoid about equipment failure). My favorite makers for fabric collars are CollarMania and Stillwater. Both have Facebook pages. Both make very sturdy collars. My dogs have both busted hardware and torn collars before, so I only trust these two makers for fabric collars. I use a Julius K9 harness, but I'm not sure I'd go with that as a primary attachment for *my* dogs. I'd probably go with Stillwater if I used a harness only. </TEXT>

Spoiler alert: I didn't get a CD player.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't like yelling, even if it's just loud voices with no aggressive tone. I don't like slamming, banging, or any loud sudden noises. I'm super jumpy, and I hate conflict. My parents fought constantly when I was young, and the shouting and slamming was a prelude to one of them leaving and the other coming to take it out on me. 

If someone shouts at me now, I tend to just completely shut down or dissociate. Or my fight or flight kicks in and I react emotionally and embarrass myself.  </TEXT>

I recently experienced the loss of a friendship I thought was close, but I was apparently wrong and just don't feel like investing myself in anyone else only to go through that again, so I am just gradually fading myself out of the rest of my friends' lives.
