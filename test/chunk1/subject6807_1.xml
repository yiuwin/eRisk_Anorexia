	<TEXT> Co-worker of mine has a tent that he carries around.  We recently moved spaces and my boss asked how it was going.  

I said, "Not too stressful.  John only has the one," as I point to his tent on the corner. 

Boss looks at it, "Does it take up too much room?"

"No," I replied, " but if he brought in another one it would be two tents. </TEXT>

The enemy Reinhardt won, and I immediately hooked him and shot him in the face.  Roadhog does not have honor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have three children with autism, ages 10, 7, and 4. My oldest is more high functioning with Aspergers, but still a challenge. Our middle child has been the most challenging getting help.  He's very smart, but has some serious behavioral issues.  Our youngest had early intervention, but still is a lot to deal with.

My wife and I went a trip in September, the first time we've been away for 4 years.  We haven't had a date since then.

My "me-time" is about 30 mins before I wake my kids up for school, if they don't decide to wake up extra early.  I also stay up late at night, but that isn't an option for everyone.

There really is no downtime unless I'm at work.  I'm blessed to have a good paying job that is flexible and not stressful.  Our house though is quite stressful, as you have to deal with multiple meltdowns a day.  
I don't know if that helps you, but it let me rant.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Leave the door open </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-14 19:29:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My door is always closed when I sleep. My wife thinks it is just one of my idiosyncrasies, but there is another reason.  

When I was young, I loved sleeping with my door open. The sounds of my parents moving around the house, watching television, etc. always comforted me knowing I was protected.
One night, when I was 8 years old, all this changed. It was like any other night. I had a good day at school, just finished playing through a few levels of Super Mario Brothers 3, and was ready for bed. I walked out to see my mom was cleaning the kitchen and my dad was on phone talking to somebody.
"Good night.", I said quietly enough to not disturb my dad on the phone but to make sure they heard me. My dad smiled at me and waved good night, but continued his conversation on the phone.  

My mom came over and kissed me on the forehead, "Good night mijo, see you in the morning!"

I walked into my room and started getting ready for bed.  Normally, I slept with my side away from my door. I liked to hear the sounds coming from my parents, but the light sometimes bothered me. I was always asleep within 5 minutes, but this night was different. I heard the same sounds that I always heard at night, but I felt something. Not something watching me, but that something  was there. I tried to relax and fall asleep, but that nagging feeling of something being at my door bothered me. I slowly turned over to look at the door.
"Was that a fingernail I just saw?" I thought, "Maybe my mom or dad were just passing my room?"  I turned back to the wall and tried to reassure myself that it was nothing.

"What was that? It couldn't haven't been my mom or dad."  My mind was racing with the possibilities of what I had just seen, and suddenly the feeling returned. Gathering my courage, I quickly flipped myself towards the door. This time, it wasn't just a fingernail. There were two long fingers, about twice as long as my dad's, with sharp pointy fingernails. I couldn't move, paralyzed with fear. I began to try and shout, my voice trapped in my throat.   

Suddenly, the fingers disappeared. I took this moment to hide under my covers.  

"I'll be safe under here," I breathed easier under the safety of my blankets, "nothing should be able to get me here."

I could still hear my parents in the living room. Could they not see what was outside my door? Surely if something was going to attack me they would notice.  

It only took a few moments before my illusion of safety melted away.  Again, I felt the presence of something at my door and I knew I was not safe under my blankets. I peeked out from my blankets, and this time an entire hand was visible. It had impossibly long fingers that were wrapped around the frame of my door. I saw one of its sharp fingernails slowly start to scratch along the inside of the frame.  
I was not safe, I needed help. I did what any 8 year old does when they get into trouble. I shouted, "Mom!"  
The hand quickly disappeared from the door frame. I took this opportunity to run as fast as I could out of my room. My mom was sitting on the couch, looking at the television.
"Mom! Mom!" I said relieved to see her, "There was something at my..."
I didn't get to finished before she responded, "It's safe to leave your door open. Now go to bed and close your eyes."
"But Mom... Mom, it wasn't," I tried to finished my statement but she cut me off again.
"It's safe to leave your door open. Now go to bed and close your eyes." She said, still staring straight at the television. I stomped my feet a bit in protest, but decided to not listen to her advice and close my door. I laid down, double checked that the door was still closed, and turned over.

It was a very restless night. I could only fall asleep for 10-15 minutes at a time, checking my door every time to ensure it was still closed. After a very long night, the sun finally rose and it was time for me to get ready for school. I walked to the our kitchen, rubbing my eyes in exhaustion.   

My mom saw me and said, "Good morning. You look really tired. Did you not sleep well?"

"I tried to just close my eyes like you said,"  I yawned before finishing my statement, "but I couldn't leave my door open or close my eyes."

My mom looked at me puzzled, "What are you talking about? I never told you that."

"Yeah you did. When I got up you were watching TV."  

"Mijo, I went to bed after I finished cleaning the kitchen. I didn't watch any TV. You must have been dreaming." She looked at me and smiled.

"Umm, yeah. I must have." I tried a weak smile to show I wasn't scared. That was not a dream. It felt too real.  

Years passed, and I never slept with my door open.  Eventually, I rationalized it must have been a dream. How else could explain what happened that night?

I have my own children now, two boys and a girl. I make sure that every night when I tuck them in, the door is closed as I leave. My middle child is 8 years old now, and he looks a lot like me when I was younger. Yesterday morning, he came into the kitchen rubbing his eyes and looking exhausted.

"Geez, up all night partying!"  I smiled as I took a sip of my coffee.

"No, I couldn't fall asleep. Can you make sure Ginger (our cat) doesn't sneak into my room again?"

"She was in your room when I tucked you in?"

"Yes, and she somehow opened the door to get out.  I...I got a little scared. That's why I came out to talk to you."  He was looking at the ground, nervously tapping his foot, "I tried to listen to what you said but I didn't feel safe with the door open. "

"Umm...I..." I couldn't even finish my thought.  It's just a dream. It had to be a dream. </TEXT>

He addresses his congregation the next Sunday and says, "I'd like to thank you all for the notes you leave for me. They are always filled with lovely advice but no name."  

He holds up the note with "Fool" on it and says, "And the one time someone leaves me their name they don't provide any advice!" </TEXT>
