	<TEXT> I tried too hard to be friends with everybody.  Always wanted to hang with all these "friends" and what not, but I never realized that I was always the one making the plans.  Never had many ask me to come, I was always the one asking. 

As soon as high school was over and the grad parties finished, I found out who the few true friends I actually had were. Went from tons of friends to a small group, and I regret wasting my time on those that didn't care like I did.  It haunts me sometimes when I think about the time wasted. </TEXT>
