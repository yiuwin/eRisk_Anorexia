	<TEXT> Yeah.  I made a joke about time traveling (which loosely involved robot prostitution).  Life time ban - asking to get back was no use.

Generally, make war memorials for your country.  Fly the flags of your country over state grounds. 
Do not fly the flag of a country you went to war with.

South Korea shouldnt fly north Korea flags over state House.

Google shouldn't put an amazon logo on its hq.

Germans shouldn't fly nazi flags.

Ukrain shouldn't fly USSR flags

Americans shouldn't fly confederate flags
