	<TEXT> DON'T REPLAY EARTHBOUND YET.   
.    
Play mother 3 first, then go back to earthbound.  
Bring your tissues because the earthbound references will hit you so hard, if you haven't played earthbound in a while you will see the references and remembering will have such an awesome effect on you rather than if you played earthbound like a week before.   

You want it to be deeply nostalgic rather than "I just saw that last week!" Trust me it's better that way.   
.  
   
Also take your time in the game, train a bit with the enemies. I went it in wanting to see the story so fast that I was severely under-leveled and forgot about all the awesome new enemies that existed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn this is much easier to do in illustrator because you can just paste a layer of colors outside the canvas. I guess what you could do in Photoshop for a work around to that specific situation would be to expand that canvas in whatever direction you want and make a new layer with most of the colors you plan on using in little squares. Then when finished crop back to original size getting rid of the colors.

	<TEXT> It was probably done in illustrator, but here's a shitty example: http://i.imgur.com/YSqO35h.jpg   
.    
.     
* You need to do a base flat drawing and bring it into photoshop.     
* Make a background white layer    
* put the drawing on a new layer above the bg    
* make a new layer above the drawing layer    
* goto drawing layer and use magic select or whatever it's called to select all of the character   
* go to the top layer and change the opacity, brush, and size to fit the strokes that are similar to your reference and start drawing over the selected character     
* Make a new layer on top of everything and use white but fiddle with the opacity and brush to start "hiding" the character by drawing over it    
* That's really it, i think the hard part is actually drawing the character.

This is what I came up with.        
I cut small L's in each inner rounded square and made it the same color of the squares but darker, then blended. I suppose if cut L's on the outside of each square and made it a slight variant of the color and blended it would match the Reference image better.

	<TEXT> What they are saying makes sense, but wouldn't you have to press B(bringing up status screen) for every time you fight a Starman and fail to get the item to avoid generating the same number? So if we want to follow their guide, you would do this:  
//  
//  

Fight first starman-load state-pop up status screen and close it-Fight Second starman-load state-pop up status screen twice in a row-Fight third starman-Load state-status screen 3 times in a row-fight fourth starman-load state-status screen 4 times in a row- Repeat forever increasing the number of times you bring up the status screen until you get the item.  
//  
//  
Or it could just be the way wiiU runs the game, it could have some kind of change in the way the randomness works.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's something we're taught in programming early on. 

To get a random number you take a basic math formula and multiply it by the elapsed time. Then subtract/divide to get the range you want like 1-128. 

So if you load a state you rewind to the game time you were previously on, the game takes that number and applies the same formula resulting in a number that would almost always be the same.  </TEXT>

copy the shading of this http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090521212858/earthbound/images/b/b6/Starman_Clay_Model.png


Lock everything and make a new layer above everything else


Make the basic shapes of the shading on the new layer with the pen tool black fill / no outline. 
Lower the opacity of the shapes until it looks right.

and boom you have a nice depth effect! </TEXT>

Check this free one out http://www.superflashbros.net/as3sfxr/


Usually sounds are made available for sale online and then companies buy them. 


As for the pop sound, I could record with my microphone me making a pop sound with my lips and then take it into Sound Editing Software and clean it up. It would then sound just like it I bet. </TEXT>

But seriously, I'm pretty sure if your body has a high enough sugar content, then it will be present in your saliva and still bad for your teeth. Though I guess it would theoretically be less sugar your teeth has contact with than the normal way of drinking. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [PC-Before windows 2k][1991-2000]Isometric City/Base Missile Wars a ***multi-windowed game? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-06 12:11:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Platform(s):PC-windows 91-99 possibly 3.x

Genre: Strategy I think

Estimated year of release: 1991-1999 My best guess would be 95

Graphics/art style: Similar to SimCity2000 

Notable characters:???

Notable gameplay mechanics: 

1.Possibly it was missile defense while building a city/base. 

2.grid like Isometric view I'm pretty sure

3. I THINK your base was on one window, and your opponent's(cpu) base was in another window, rectangular portrait oriented windows each taking about 1/8 the size of your screen?  

4. Vaguely remember that in order to attack you would drag a missile from your window to the enemy's window

5. I have a small memory of the floor of each city was just green(grass) but that could be my brain horribly stitching a false memory

6. The game may involve only missiles and no other forms of military. I'm not 100% sure on that though, sorry.


Other details: 
1. I mean window like opening a new window on your desktop, not like a house window. In fact, I remember being able to see your desktop while you were playing. 

2. I played this game as a DEMO in a PC GAMER demo disc from the magazine as a kid. From what i remember i played it a few times but my dad got a new computer nearly after that and my brother lost the demo disc. Ever since i can't remember which disc or issue it was. The game may have even not been released but maybe you remember the demo at least? Also my bro remembers nothing from the 90's so he's no help

3. Even if the game you think of is not multi windowed please post it! It might be it and my brain just might suck at remembering!

4. Games I know it's not: Deadlock, Scorched Earth, missle command, command and conquer, defcon

5. Prize to whoever gets it first, probably something with steam.  

Thank you for your help!

	<TEXT> Happens to me too, here's a idea, but it might not apply to everyone and might be wrong entirely.

Your brain is probably having less activity  when watching tv, especially if your watching a rerun of something you've seen. When you turn the TV off you might start thinking of what you are planning for tomorrow, people you will talk to, and  other random things that you might be reminded of when thinking about those things! 

For me, eventually I will fall asleep but it takes like an hour... 

Sometimes i just waste electricity though and fall asleep with it on, then wake up if it gets loud I turn if off and go right back to sleep.

Always keep the remote close!

Oh and this is when i'm in bed watching tv in my room, not like a couch in a living room.

I hear walking from the living room to the bedroom can fully wake you up as well! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So basically after trying everything in the guide 5 times, forwarding all ports, disabling all firewalls, and allowing my pc to be viciously violated. Netplay still wouldn't work. 

Eventually, I just plugged straight into my modem.

My setup is ISP-Modem-belkin router-pc

It worked right away as soon as i set up a STATIC IP and plugged straight into the modem. 

Setting up port forwarding and even DMZ mode wasn't enough. I had to cut it out completely. 


tl;dr Your router is probably ass like mine and you need a new one. </TEXT>
