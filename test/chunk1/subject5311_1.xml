	<TEXT> I seem to only find griping posts lately about firefall and the state it's in, so i want to give a different perspective on Firefall.  
Thank you Red5 for the great memories that i made while playing this game.  The sniping of the Chosen in the watchtowers from 200M, the taking of the WTs as a Bastion single handedly.  The flying for seemingly ever with the Assault frames.  The roasting and slamming down on the aranhas from a high distance.  Many more great times did i have in the game than i have listed here.

Let's use this thread to talk about the good times we had, not just raise cain about what the game didn't do, and so on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I say this because all of the series deal with the same "artifact" system.

I believe that this is either the same universe or the same show taking place over and over again. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to start flatlining? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-28 21:29:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am  34 year old guy that is a virgin, and suffers from POIS. I want to lose my sex drive/libido. I have been eating all of the foods that help to lose it. I was wondering if there is a way to induce flatlining and keep it going?  The last time I fapped, it damn near killed me, I had vicious POIS symptoms (explosive diarrhea, projectile vomiting, brain fog, etc) and I can't take that again. I only fap about once a week anyway. The last time was a week ago. Any suggestions are welcomed. Thank you all for your help. </TEXT>
