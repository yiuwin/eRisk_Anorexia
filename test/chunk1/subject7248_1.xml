	<TEXT> Dude. If you look up definitions of pornography they all say the exact same thing as Dr_Spaghetii. They are not complaining or making a statement about pornography, they're just defining it.

However there are tile sets you can get that give the game simplistic graphics. </TEXT>

Want to learn more about ants?

A fun source online is Antweb (https://www.antweb.org/). It contains a vast catalog of ant species and photos. It doesn't teach you much about the species, but it's a blast to look at.
The show Life In The Undergrowth with David Attenborough is a fantastic show about arthropods in general, and it has some great episodes with ants. Here is a great scene from the show about a species of ant in Australia (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er-OnJCn1gg ).

If you would like more comprehensive information in book form, I highly suggest Adventures Among Ants by Mark W. Moffett or The Superorganism by E. O. Wilson and Bert Hlldobler. Both of these books can be a bit expensive (especially if you only have a passing interest in Myrmecology) so I would suggest checking if you can find a library copy. Adventures Among Ants is the more accessible of the two.

If none of these options sound appealing, I highly suggest reading some Wikipedia articles! There are actually some pretty good articles about intriguing ant species. I suggest these ones:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leafcutter_ant

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaver_ant

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adetomyrma

and

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_ant

Have fun learning about the ant! </TEXT>

WARNING! Wall of text ahead!

I couldn't help myself writing so much, but I hope you learn something fun about ants!

The black flying ants were likely part of the same species. Ant colonies are made up of several different castes of ants that are all the same species. Each caste offers something unique for the colony. The average species of ant has just three castes. There is the queen (who lays all the eggs in the colony), the drones (whose sole purpose is to mate with new queens), and the workers (who are all female and do all the nest building, foraging, and fighting). The queens and drones start out life with wings. The workers never have wings. Some species of ant also have additional castes of major workers and minor workers. Generally major workers are larger and will partake in more combat.

Once a year the new queens and the drones will go on a mating flight where they will fly some distance from the nest, and mate mid-flight. The drones will die soon after because they cannot survive on their own, and they have completed their purpose in life. The newly mated queen will begin digging a new nest, will chew off her wings for sustenance, and will begin laying eggs. The first eggs will be the workers who will begin foraging and digging the nest deeper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope. The old queen lays eggs that hatch into new queens and drones. These new queens and drones then leave the nest and start new colonies! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! I mentioned warrior castes, but only briefly. "Some species of ant also have additional castes of major workers and minor workers. Generally major workers are larger and will partake in more combat."

Some species of ant even have three castes of workers. My favorite species of ants with a major and a worker caste is Pheidologeton Diversus. A remarkable ant with a giant major worker caste. The major workers are so big that the smaller workers can ride on them like a war elephant!

	<TEXT> That's quite interesting about the google searches. One possibility for many of the searches is that people are doing research without actually planning on attempting a dangerous "DIY abortion". That's what I hope at least. I'll have to do some more research on Google Trends. I hadn't even considered using it before. </TEXT>
