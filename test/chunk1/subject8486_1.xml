	<TEXT> All three of those are nice, fancy afternoon teas.

Boston does not offer a huge variety of options for afternoon tea.  The restaurant in the main branch of the BPL at Copley Square offers it Wed-Fri: http://www.thecateredaffair.com/bpl/courtyard/Web%20Tea%20Menu.pdf
Another place to try would be Dado Tea near Harvard Square, or TeaLuxe (right in Harvard Square). </TEXT>

Like most rights, you may never need to exercise the right to a jury trial.  But if you do, you'll be very glad that honest persons like yourself take the time out of their busy schedules to show up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whitey was a mob boss in this town.  Everyone knew it.  He wasn't particularly smart, but he was particularly brutal.  In 1995, the Globe discovered there was a reason why he had been successful: he was an FBI informant.  And not only was he an FBI informant, having ratted out some of his rivals to the Feds, but the FBI was protecting him.  There were years-long investigations which suddenly collapsed, after the FBI heard about the undercover work.  Then, when Bulger is finally indicted, the FBI tips him off, and he hides out for 16 years.

Add to that the intriguing spice that his brother, Billy Bulger, was president of the Mass. State Senate -- an extremely important and powerful politician.

It's a great story.  Read "Black Mass", or read some of the old Globe stories collected here: http://www.boston.com/news/specials/whitey/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The registration wall is actually by pageviews in a day, as measured by a cookie.  So if you are not logged in, you can look at 4 (I think that is the number currently) articles before you get asked to register.  The home page and certain other pages don't count.

[Disclosure: I work for them, but I don't speak for them]

	<TEXT> I work at boston.com/the Globe, and although the institution is in the middle of a painful transition, I think it is definitely an interesting place to work.  We're hiring for a whole bunch of positions, and while none of them jump out as perfect for you, it might be worth it to take a look:

Also, last week, @bostontweet compiled a list of companies that are hiring: http://bostontweet.com/tweets/258366  (don't know how many are creative and collaborative places, but some look that way). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say calling Jewishness an ethnicity is the closest description we have in America for people who share a common descent but whose nationality and citizenship is American.

As some of the other commenters have pointed out, Judaism is often expressed in America by the sorts of things that other ethnic groups do: food, outlooks, customs, common history.  These are in addition to the religious rituals and beliefs </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An MLS program is usually only two years.  Most law schools are 3, doctors more.

As with any professional education, a lot of it is about setting people apart with abstruse knowledge.  But there's also a lot of understanding how to organize information, knowing how to find stuff, management, and customer service. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Aquarium is open and fine.  It's noisy, but very impressive.  They've got a nice new area to display their seals.

If the weather is nice, I'd take a walk along the Charles River.  You could either start at Harvard, the Charles/MGH stop on the MBTA red line, or at the Museum of Science (which is actually built over the river). </TEXT>
