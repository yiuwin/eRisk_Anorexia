	<TEXT> Dehydrated veggie chips sounds great! I'll have to look for those. 

High calorie snacking looks to be the general consensus so far, I don't know why I've been so stuck on my "meal time" routine. I think grazing throughout the day will make it a whole lot easier to get calories in, rather than trying to fix proper meals every time. Thank you!!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Balance... something I've always struggled with. I haven't really thought about it much though. I think I'm going to start planning out a rough sketch of varied meals/snacks for each day so I can keep track of my intake easier.

Those breakfasts sounds delicious, I'll definitely try variations of those foods you suggested! And I'm really pumped about summer rolling around, admittedly I have been known to eat a pint of ice cream in one sitting.. for some reason that stuff is like crack and I love it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in Texas so marijuana pills aren't an option (I got kicked out of school 6 months ago for smoking to increase my appetite) also, psychoactive substances mess with my meds that I take daily. 

And all of that about protein and 300-500 extra calories is all really great advice, but I can hardly stomach half of a banana for breakfast, much less high protein meals/snacks. I'll definitely start keeping a bag of chips or bowl of trailmix or something out for easy access. Thanks for the idea! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I go to a psychiatrist/psychotherapist for the Bipolar and stuff, I haven't really thought about talking to him about it.. Seems like an obvious thing in hindsight. And  ya, I make sure that I take a 1 a day vitamin; I figure I'm not getting a lot of calories throughout the day but at least try to get SOME nutrients. I try to eat mostly things like avocados, nuts, pastas, bread, and some tofu/beans if I can stomach it.

and I agree that a nutritionist is 100% the best option, but unfortunately since getting kicked out of school 6 months ago I haven't been able to hold a job down and scraping by with just enough to pay the few bills that I have to (I had to move back in with my parents so that they could take care of/supervise me), so spending more money just isn't an option, and I'm pretty sure our insurance doesn't cover a nutritionist, but it is certainly worth looking into. Thanks!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy shit that is a great idea!! I always have to drink quite a bit of water between bites to try to clear the taste out, a small candy or something could be a tool to get food down easier + more calories and stuff. Thanks!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, after I got diagnosed with Anorexia I actually picked up smoking as a medicine (a few hits to just get a little hit of appetite)  rather than just to get fucked up and I went up to about 103 pounds or so and was feeling the healthiest I ever have. Unfortunately, I live in Texas and got caught by the cops... Got kicked out of school (2nd year college), depression and anxiety ensued and I've been losing weight since then (a little over 5 pounds in six months). But it gets even worse -- I'm bipolar 2, and so getting high regularly really messes with my medicines effectiveness  so even though it was effective for weight gain it hurts my mental health a lot more than it helps me. 

Edit: to clarify, when I smoked to gain weight I was in full hypomania mode and lost grips on reality  a little bit, but damn I felt good.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't thought about making one really good meal and gradually eating it throughout the day, I'll definitely try that! I actually love cooking and making new recipes and stuff from scratch, but it is a lot less about eating it, but more about creating something and being artistic; normally I just end up not eating much of it or just giving it someone else to eat. Thinking about how you said to try to take just 1 bite at a time, I think that I might hype it up a lot like "I need to eat all of this" and it gets really intimidating, so I guess it is a lot more about my mental state rather than just physical need for food. Thanks for the input!!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely. It's a fairly populated game and is by no means on any sort of decline. Plus, on the 15th ANet is going to introduce "megaservers" where (as far as I understand it, at least) the game will link lots of servers together (depending on region/language/regularity) so that the players linked on the megaserver share the same maps. Theoretically the megaserver change is supposed to even populate most leveling zones with lots of players. I think overall GW2 is becoming a much stronger game since launch.

oh, and happy cake day!! :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for not being mean. :)

  You fix it by lobbying legislators and filing court cases.

I'm completely disenchanted with the US political system. I think that the U.S. government is a neoliberalist machine that only seeks to perpetuate the power and control of the White Heteronormative Man and at the same time completely stomps out democracy and diversity. Is there space for real progress to be made? I think that it's an arguable conjecture. That being said, I don't think that it is useless to try to affect government policies (in fact, I think it is necessary in most cases). Not really the point of this thread. TL;DR I really dislike the USFG, but if people want to create change through it, go for it, I guess.

 The other, the one you're most concerned with, had no bright lines

Welcome to the Postmodern Critique. LOL! This is where you are totally right. I don't have a solution -- I don't think that there is a clear or direct solution. The most productive thing I can perceive is what we are doing: Dialogue. It doesn't directly effectuate change but presents ideas into a public forum. I don't expect you or anyone reading this to agree with me (persuasion isn't my concern even a little bit), but to read it and reflect on it. I just want people to think about it. I promise anyone reading my posts have thought significantly about the Queer body and it's relation to social movements and the implications that that has than they did before they read what I wrote, whether they agree with me or not. That's the important part.

 Giving up on either front is foolish.

I agree to some extent. Like I said, I'm completely disenchanted with the USFG and think that all it will do with any policy is only make its power and control stronger while oppressing everyone else. 

 and not talking to people with whom you disagree leaves you poorer.

I realize we are only talking about semantics here. Most of my thinking is heavily influenced by an (awesome) dude named Paulo Friere. He argued that dialogue was the best way to effectuate any sort of positive change. He defined dialogue with multiple components:

1.) Have mutual respect for each other. (This is why keeping the conversation as friendly as possible is SO important to me. Once you start telling how my beliefs are childish and come from the same logic used by bigots probably means that there isn't a whole lot of respect. I might as well shut down at that point because the conversation won't go anywhere productive.)

2.) Concerned with a Praxis. A praxis (as used by Friere) is a process that generally requires dialogue and always required critical thinking and reflection. When two or more people come together and enter this dialogical praxis, Friere argues that people become infinitely more informed about the status quo surrounding them, and thus infinitely more able to make informed decisions to transform the status quo. 

3.) A focus on "Naming the World". This is essentially creating a space for those who are voiceless. In this instance it is the Queer Bodies being named.

I hope I did Friere's concept of Dialogue a fraction of the justice that he did. So essentially.. we are saying very similar things with this arguing/dialogue thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly, let me be 100% clear -- I have absolutely nothing against anyone getting married - gay or otherwise. If it is legal to be married where I live, I'll probably get married because it is the only recognition commitment society accepts and it the most pragmatic option (like hospital visits, insurance, taxes, etc...) 

  while apparently also rejecting them as insufficiently Queer.

That is exactly what I'm doing. The Queer body has been homogenized to fit better into the heteronormative dominated culture. This concept is called "Homonormativity" -- The implication being that there has been an acceptable mold created to reflect the heteronormative; however, much like the heteronormative the homonormative is just as binding and oppressive. 

 the academic language you're using is just a smokescreen for fear that you'll be left behind after marriage equality.

Ignoring the language jab, that's my point. The direction of the ENTIRE equality movement for the sexual minority is focused on marriage. That will exclude and further oppress people, and that's never going to produce real equality. The idea that I (or anyone) would be left behind after marriage "Equality" is achieved means that there is a real inherent problem with the marriage equality movement.

 But more "mainstream" gays and lesbians aren't a political tool

Unfortunately, this isn't true (well, part of it is). Everything from the products you consume, the media you absorb, who you love, where you live, etc.. are all political actions. Everything that you do or say has an enormous implication MUCH bigger and MUCH more severe than seen at face value. Humans are political beings and there is no way around that. I do agree no one should be a political "tool" -- implication being someone is being used by someone else to a specific end. 

 and feeling they should continue to suffer lest they stop being useful to your ends

A.) I don't think that people should suffer at the cost of me being able to be married when the entire institution of marriage serves as a reminder of how they aren't recognized as a legitimate human being capable of love and commitment.

B.) I don't have a personal stake in standing against marriage. There are 16 states that I could be married in. I'm not trans*, I'm not polygamist... I could easily fit into the paradigm of (hetero)/(homo)normative. I feel that my stake in this is what I would call "Solidarity with the Human Experience" -- essentially because I'm a human being, I am intrinsically connected to every single human being on the globe, and I'm not free from oppression until everyone is free from oppression. I can't advocate for a policy that would grant marriage equality for me when the same policy will only further the oppression of the Queer Body.

Lastly, fyi I'm not "arguing". I absolutely adore this discourse and dialouge. I think it's the bees knees. I'm having a great time. #upvotesforeveryone     

edit: Shout out to /r/radicalqueers. It's a fairly slow/small sub, but there is some great content posted! 

edit2: added a few words. They are hard to use sometimes.                                                       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are definitely a lot of arguments as to why what I believe could be/probably is a bad thing (e.g. Queer Theory and Death Drive or Self Ghettoization in the name of deconstructing the normative).

However... Monstrous? Self-Righteous? I guess I just don't understand how those two things link to my belief. 

and I guess to clarify a bit more: My main argument is that when the Queer Body assimilates into (hetero)/(homo)normativity through pushing for marriage, at the same time they are pushing for the people who can never fit into a normative paradigm to be pushed further to the periphery of the societal sphere that is recognized of being "fully Human" (aka "Equal").

For example, Marriage will always push out those who don't function in a monogamous relationship. When I advocate for my "Right to marry" here in Texas, at the same time I am inadvertently advocating for a society that only accepts monogamy as the only legitimate representation of Love or Commitment. This was a HUGE problem in the civil rights movement when the fight for political representation and suffrage (which is still ongoing). In 1870 when Minority Men we allowed to vote of course lots of people we elated, but at the same time the 15th amendment secured Women's political inferiority. 

So, in the same way only allowing a specific portion of the population access to perceived preformative actions of love/commitment (aka marriage), at the same time is securing the inferiority of those who don't fit into normative structures. I think the institution of marriage is the biggest breaking point for this as well; Gay Marriage is the focus and idealization of the mainstreams movement for "equality", so once a state has allows two people of the same gender to be committed to each other the largest of the "fight for equality" is over -- even though a good portion of the LGTBQ (and even straight) population is no pushed even further from being perceived by society.

so I dunno... I definitely don't think what I believe is "Monstrous" by any means, and I definitely don't feel better about myself when I say that I don't think that the institution of marriage should be abolished entirely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm late to the party, but whatever.

I am against the idea and concept of gay marriage as a form of "Equality".

I believe (gay)marriage perpetuates the (hetero)normative. The more that the Queer body fights to have the same access to marriage as the heterosexual, the further the Queer Body loses their Queer identity and is assimilated into the (hetero)normative power systems/structures. Once assimilation (read: Equality) is achieved there is no longer a Queer Identity to push back and/or be critical of the existing (Hetero)normative systems.

Edit: I use the term "Queer" not necessarily defined as the majority of the Gay Community. Read "Queer" more as a concept of identity that is explicitly not heteronormative or homonormative. </TEXT>
