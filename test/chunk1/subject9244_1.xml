	<TEXT> Why do I care? I don't, too much. I'm not the most active user in this sub. The topic was brought up, it resonated a bit, thought I might as well share my impression. As I said originally, it's just a bit off-putting for me, that's all I wanted to say (and subsequently tried to parse out why I thought that). If others don't share this, that's cool. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Official connection = run by sub's mods

This website, www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions, can do most everything via text posts and the like, that a blog can do. If you're creating a blog to do the little that this website can't, fine, but given most of I've seen that isn't the case.

Also, unless that content is directly responding to an issue unique to *this* Lions community, it should be evaluated on its merits in the same pool as all other Lions fan content. The proportion of Lions fan content linked from DLP as opposed to elsewhere is ginormous.

Each subreddit is a website in itself. 99% of them haven't found the need to spawn an "arm" site on the side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As to self promotion, again, it was created by and, more importantly, for r/detroitlions. Which means it stands to serve the subreddit.

This sounds like some poor rationalization to me. It's not like /r/detroitlions is some overly unique Lions community. It's a Lions fan community. DetroitLionsPodcast.com is a Lions blog, just like many other Lions blogs. The content "for" this sub is Lions content, that's it. Saying your blog has a unique ability to serve this community that all the other Detroit Lions-related content providers don't rings hollow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tbh I've been turned off to this sub recently because of this -- mods using it as a tool of self-promotion for a site they created knowing full well they had this resource, /r/detroitlions, at their disposal for it. It's another Lions blog, which there are more than a few of now, and that's fine. All the power to anyone willing to create one. But when such a huge portion of this sub's posts are links to an otherwise obscure fan blog (serious question: are all its posts linked here?), which by coincidence the mods run, it's a little off-putting. If its links here stuck to their more original ideas and content of the site (not [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/554dun/nfl_admits_longest_penalty_in_15_years_was_a/), or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/552b17/five_detroit_lions_miss_practice_to_open_week_four/)), as tends to be the case for other sites' links here, I can't imagine I'd have issue with it. </TEXT>

It's ultra-heavy and serious and dark and plays with the anti-hero stuff of recent, which aren't new and usually turn-offs for me these days, but it has just this beautiful sense of place (which *is* new to the US TV viewer-me), and overall seems very well executed. I'm liking it so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a lover of the web series, for some reason this episode really put me off. Maybe I wasn't expecting the devastatingly sad tone of the latter part of the episode, or my hopes were unrealistic given recent nostalgia or whatever, but my reaction was immediate dislike to the episode as a whole, and especially how they handled the Max/Lainey storyline. (The opening visit w/the actors didn't do much for me, either.)

Treating Max seriously and with compassion was great -- that was the best part of the episode. But to then ruin all that good stroytelling by having him trampled by a cartoon character was neither funny nor compelling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rod Wood has talked about making it a point to talk in public, too. "I do a lot of (interviews) because I know our fans want to read, listen or hear about the team. If I don't talk to (the media) that takes away an opportunity for (the fans) to hear about what's going on." ([Crain's](http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160905/NEWS/160909920/exclusive-lions-president-rod-wood-on-future-of-matthew-stafford-jim))

If the fans are kept abreast of the process and why certain decisions are made they're more likely to give the benefit of the doubt. Mayhew and Lewand did the absolute least possible amount of this. And Lewand's public output was tinged with constant terribly-veiled disingenuous lawyer-speak.

	<TEXT> This age thing is getting a bit overplayed now. He's not *that* old. At draft time he was only one year older than the standard redshirt player who played out his eligibility.

And the age issue plays in both directions. The earlier the Lions extend him the earlier they get out. And if they never choose any multi-year extension his age only adds to the drama of the lack of goodwill the Lions would be showing to their homegrown superstar who has done everything right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It makes pragmatic sense for them to keep him on the team for the next 3 years at a more reasonable price.

An extension wouldn't change that. An option year plus one or two FT years aren't cheap at all.

I'm also not sure he's the team's best player. But that's a whole other discussion. He's certainly ONE of the teams best players.

Agree. I think Slay is this team's best player. I think Ziggy is this team's most valuable player, however. His skillset is rarer, his role is more important IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it's likely he plays on his 5th-year option let alone a franchise tag year. The Lions are not going to want to yank around their best player. In this new CBA teams have tended to stay away from stringing along elite players like Ziggy at the end of their rookie deals. If he doesn't get a new deal next offseason I'll be surprised.

It will be better for the team and the player I think. It will provide financial security for Ansah as well as the option to get another decently-sized deal at the end of it, and let the Lions get the rest of his prime and avoid any contract-year drama (possibly plural if FTs). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They'll go down significantly but he should still be among the league leaders in receptions among running backs. That carries a lot of value in today's NFL. *My* one complaint with this deal would be locking into this duplication in skill-sets between he and Abdullah, but I still like it overall. Running backs who can do what Riddick do are undervalued commodities; in 5-10 years, they'll be valued significantly higher IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really hard for me to envision a situation where the Lions let Ziggy walk. Even if you don't value premium positions as highly as the rest of the league, or have any other predispositions acting against extending him. It's not like the Lions are loaded up on stars (and their commensurate contracts) right now.

For leverage purposes, yes, but in reality these situations (new CBA, elite 1st-rd picks) have rarely played out that way IIRC. Ziggy will probably get a new deal next offseason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stanley's mentality is interesting. On balance it has to be a plus, but with the standing up to LeBron and not being afraid of the spotlight you also get a guy who might not be the most coachable. From Keith Langlois [a few weeks ago](http://www.nba.com/pistons/features/svg-eyes-across-board-gains-2-stand-out-most-growth-potential):
Johnson is notoriously confident and headstrong, which Van Gundy admires  while admitting it presents a coaching quandary.

Its an ongoing challenge, for him and for us. But the strength Stanley has is hes got a tremendous passion for the game and tremendous desire to be great. Hes as good a competitor as youll find in this league, as young as he is. What goes along with that is a stubbornness, to some degree. At times, Ill be honest  working with him can be a little bit frustrating because of that. He thinks he knows the way to do it.

But also what goes along with that is a guy who just doesnt give in easily in games, either. Hes just not going to give in. Hes a tough guy. Id rather have it the way he is than a guy who lets say is 100 percent compliant but doesnt get out there and really fight like he does on the court. Everybodys a little bit different and everybodys got different strengths and different weaknesses. His tough mind is his greatest strength and at times can be his  I wont even say his greatest weakness, but it makes him a challenge to deal with. But hes a tough guy out there and were happy to have him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can keep making excuses. The fact is, everything eventually manifests on the field, and what manifested from IAQ last season, in his first exposure in extended snaps, was the performance of a good safety in the NFL. What will he do going forward? Who knows, but chances are it will be better than what Bush and Wilson do. The best predictor of future performance is past performance, as they say, and in a "what have you done for me lately" league, IAQ's current status/projection is a solid one. </TEXT>

Yeah...you're going to have to back up that statement. Safeties are hard to judge anyway, not being on the broadcast angles of preseason games, but his practice reports were rather nondescript (and if anything, that's being generous) as well from what I remember. </TEXT>
