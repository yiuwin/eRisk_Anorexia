	<TEXT> and I'm trying to get some munchies. My eyeballs are burnt. Besides the clerk, I was the only one there. I must've circle every isle 3 times. I finally get some chips and ice cream and go to pay for it. The clerk is an older Hindu guy. While he was ringing my stuff up, I made a last minute stoned decision to get those 2 for $1 chocolate chip cookies at the counter. The clerk just puts them in the bag without ringing them up and smiled at me. I told him he ruled. Great ending to a night. Just thought you should know. Gona enjoy these cookies and watch some of The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. This show is tha bomb.

	<TITLE> Mrs. Pink Pink </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-10-23 03:36:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Mrs. Pink Pink lived in a pink pink house. Everything she owned was pink pink. The walls were pink pink, the floor was pink pink, the furniture, the TV, the appliances, all were pink pink. One night, Mrs Pink Pink was ready for bed. She turned off the pink pink TV, went up the pink pink stairs, down the pink pink hallway, into her pink pink bedroom, turned off her pink pink lamp, crawled into her pink pink bed, and had pink pink dreams. All of a sudden, the pink pink doorbell rings. She wakes out of her pink pink dream, gets out of her pink pink bed, walks out of her pink pink bedroom, through the pink pink hallway, down the pink pink stairs, go to the pink pink door, and opened it. It's Mr. Blue Blue. "I'm sorry to bother you this late, Mrs. Pink Pink, but I lost my keys to my house and can't get in. It's too late to call the locksmith, so can I stay here for the night?" "Sure" she replied. So Mrs. Pink Pink let Mr. Blue Blue in her pink pink house, and unfolded the pink pink couch, and gave him a pink pink blanket and some pink pink pillows from the pink pink linen closet. "Good night, Mr. Blue Blue." "Goodnight" he replied. Mrs. Pink Pink then went up the pink pink stairs, down the pink pink hallway, into her pink pink bedroom, turned off her pink pink lamp, crawled into her pink pink bed, and had pink pink dreams. 

Suddenly, the pink pink doorbell rings again. So she woke out of her pink pink dream, gets out of her pink pink bed, walks out of her pink pink bedroom, through the pink pink hallway, down the pink pink stairs, go to the pink pink door, and opened it. It's Mr. Green Green. "Excuse me, Mrs. Pink Pink, but my car broke down in front of your pink pink house, and since their isn't an auto shop opened at this hour, I was wondering if I could crash here tonight?" "No prob," she said, "but Mr. Blue Blue is on the pink pink couch, so you'll have to sleep on the pink pink recliner." "Okie doke" Mr. Green Green replied. So Mrs. Pink Pink let Mr. Green Green into her pink pink home, got him a pink pink blanket and a pink pink pillow from the pink pink linen closet, and let him sleep on the pink pink recliner. "Goodnight, you two." "Goodnight, Mrs Pink Pink" they both replied. Mrs. Pink Pink then went up the pink pink stairs, down the pink pink hallway, into her pink pink bedroom, turned off her pink pink lamp, crawled into her pink pink bed, and had pink pink dreams. 

Once again, the pink pink doorbell rang. So she woke out of her pink pink dream, gets out of her pink pink bed, walks out of her pink pink bedroom, through the pink pink hallway, down the pink pink stairs, go to the pink pink door, and opened it. It was Mr. Yellow Yellow. "Pardon me, Mrs. Pink Pink, but my wife kicked me out of the house and I need a place to sleep for the night. Is it cool if I sleep here." "Sure thing," she replied, "but Mr. Blue Blue is on the pink pink couch and Mr. Green Green is on the pink pink recliner. I'm afraid all I have left is the pink pink floor." Mr. Yellow Yellow thought for a second, and then said, "Fine by me!" So Mrs. Pink Pink let Mr. Yellow Yellow in her pink pink house, moved the pink pink coffee table closer to the pink pink wall, gave Mr. Yellow Yellow the remaining pink pink pillows and pink pink blankets from the pink pink closet, and let him sleep on the pink pink floor. "Goodnight, you boys" she said with a smile. "Goodnight, Mom" the guys said jokingly. Mrs. Pink Pink then went up the pink pink stairs, down the pink pink hallway, into her pink pink bedroom, turned off her pink pink lamp, crawled into her pink pink bed, and had pink pink dreams. 

The next morning, Mr. Blue Blue, Mr. Green Green, and Mr. Yellow Yellow met Mrs. Pink Pink in the pink pink kitchen for breakfast. "What'll it be? I've got Fruit Loops and I've got Cheerios." Mr. Blue Blue answered, "I'll have Cheerios." Mr. Green Green answered, "Fruit Loops for me." Mr. Yellow Yellow answered, "Cheerios, please." The point of this antijoke is that 2 out of 3 people prefer Cheerios over Fruit Loops. </TEXT>
