	<TEXT> I want to see Wilson Fisk and Norman Osborn competing in the 2019 Republican primaries.  That would be a major theme of Daredevil Season 4 with the series ending with the actual election with one of them winning.  The Marvel Universe then all goes to hell with a Dark Avengers storyline that culminates in Thunderbolts Season 2 with the Thunderbolts actually bringing down the entire administration.  I would be okay with no TV characters crossing over into the movies as long as the plotline is acknowledged in the movies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Episode 7

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) travel to Lagos, Nigeria and meet with their local mission specialist, Jerico Drumm. In the comics, Jerico Drumm is known as Brother Voodoo but here is just an expert on ancient African religions. Apparently, local girls have been kidnapped by one of these cults. They are being used as sex slaves. The government isnt equipped to deal with them. 
Thunderbolt is sending the Thunderbolts in exchange for valuable trade benefits for the United States.

Meanwhile, Marc Spector goes to work driving his taxi in the worst parts of New York. In his taxi, hi picks up drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes. He hears things. On some nights, he doesnt go out as Frenchie. Instead, he goes out as Moon Knight. He doesnt have a cape: he just has a white suit and a white mask. He also doesnt want to drive one of Steven Grants cars so he drives his taxi and hopes that nobody notices Frenchie wearing a white suit. He then pulls the taxi over, gets out and puts on his Moon Knight mask. Some criminals are going to get their ass whooped.

Episode 8

Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter are being briefed by Jerico Drumm. Apparently they have learned where the cult is keeping the young girls. Bobbi Morse tells the team that this is to be a stealth mission. She doesnt want a single hostage to lose her life this time.

Marc Spector is driving his taxi again. He picks up Russian men. Marc puts on a thick French accent. The two Russians get into the cab and start talking as though he wasnt even there. Marc hears something about a nuclear weapon in Kazakhstan. They say that they are investigating different options as to how to smuggle it out of Kazakhstan and use it against the United States. 

The Thunderbolts rescue the young girls and the young girls are returned to their parents. Of course, a lot of cult members get killed: they get stabbed, shot, blasted and hit over the head with batons. But it all happens so quickly that none of the girls get hurt.

Meanwhile, in Washington, Spector shows up in Rosss office. He says he wants back in.

Episode 9

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) return to Washington and are surprised to see Marc Spector. Thunderbolt Ross tells them that Spector has overheard intel concerning a plot to bring a nuclear weapon from Kazakhstan to the U.S. He says that the information is limited so the Thunderbolts are going to be on call until the CIA is able to investigate the veracity of this information. He tells them that they are to enjoy a little bit of R R but to not go too far away and stay in touch.

So, yeah, its anti-heros night out. Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Marc Spector, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter all go out together for a night on the town. And it isnt the slightest bit suspicious because they are three men and three women. Shippers will be wetting their pants and, yes, Elektra and the Punisher do get a hotel room and end up in bed together as do Spider-Woman and Marc Spector and Bobbi and Hunter. Bobbi and Hunter are married so its no big deal. Jessica and Marc discuss how they are both compelled to do things and how it is making each of them a little bit crazy.

Episode 10

Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Marc Spector, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter are called in by Thunderbolt Ross. Apparently he has new intel.

The big bad is Igor Stravinsky. His group is known as Leviathan. They had ties to the KGB and the Black Widow program and perhaps even the Soviet Winter Soldier program. He tells them that they will need to expect to face enhanced individuals. Their weapons may be useless. They need to train as they have never trained before.

Bobbi organizes time in a gym. The Thunderbolts are trained in hand to hand combat. As most of them are ex-military. this is nothing new to them but Bobbi tells them that the object of this exercise is to have everybody learn from each other.

Thunderbolt Ross calls them in again. The CIA has credible intel as to the bombs location are to be shipped out ASAP.

Episode 11

Igor Stravinsky was, of course, a member of Hydra and was involved in the Winter Soldier program. Sebastian Stan appears as the Winter Soldier. We see the Winter Soldier sent out on a mission by Stravinsky. Scarlett Johansson may cameo as the Black Widow.

Years later, after the fall of Hydra, Igor joined Leviathan. They wanted Igor to provide them with super soldiers of their own. They have many recruits. Not all of them survive but he manages to produce a six member team of super soldiers who are all capable of surviving conventional attacks.

Episode 12

The Thunderbolts arrive in Kazakhstan and meet with the local CIA team. They explain to them exactly where the bomb is being hidden and how it is being protected. The CIA operatives explain that they will assist them in penetrating the facility.

The Thunderbolts get past the Leviathan guards. Now they must face the Leviathan super soldiers.

Episode 13

As Ross predicted, guns, knives and batons are not effective against the super soldiers. Venom blasts turn out to be very effective, however, but even at close range they do not kill, only weaken, and Spider-Woman needs time to recharge. Thus the battle rages on for most of the episode.

Ultimately, the Thunderbolts are successful and the CIA takes possession of the nuclear bomb. Obviously the bomb will have to be turned over to the Soviets but the actual terms under which the bomb is returned will have to be negotiated. After all, the Soviets dont want to have it come out that they allowed a nuclear weapon to fall into the hands of domestic terrorists.

The Thunderbolts return back to Washington. Drug lords in Colombia are dead, hostages were rescued in South East Asia and Africa, terror threats in Egypt and Kazakhstan were eliminated. And yet their names stayed out of the newspapers. Officially, they are all in prison. That means they have done their jobs.

A followup to this series would have either Wilson Fisk or Norman Osborn as President of the United States perhaps with the other one as Vice President.  The Punisher would refuse to work for such an administration and would go rogue, possibly with a plan to assassinate the president and members of his administration.  The rest of the Tunderbolts are pardoned for whatever crimes they committed in the past but they are also reluctant to work for this administration so perhaps the Thunderbolts are replaced by something darker like the Abomination, Venom, Carnage, the Lizard, Ghost Rider and Blade.  They are given the responsibility of protecting the president and his administration so now the Punisher has to fight Venom, Carnage, Ghost Rider and Blade.  Ghost Rider and Blade switch sides and Season 2 ends with the Punisher, Ghost Rider, Blade, Moon Knight, Elektra and Spider-Woman taking down the entire government. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would want a Netflix series.  Here's my pitch.

The Punisher series ends with the Punisher going to jail. Meanwhile, Elektra is brought back to life in the Defenders and Bullseye is introduced and imprisoned at the end of Daredevil Season 3. Each series ends with Thunderbolt Ross propositioning them to join the Thunderbolts.

Episode 1

The episode begins mid res. Elektra, the Punisher, Bullseye and Marc Spector are fighting drug lords in South America.

One week ago, Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye and Marc Spector were recruited by Thunderbolt Ross. They were to be his special ops team. Under no circumstances were they to ever tell anyone who they were working for: their actions overseas will violate international laws and perhaps even be considered acts of war by the US government against the local countries. In particular, their actions could be seen as violating the Sokovia Accords because their abilities are arguably superhuman, but fuck the accords because they were just a way to rein in the Avengers and SHIELD. 
The United States always has and always will carry out covert missions overseas.

Their first mission: to take out a group of drug lords in Colombia.
The drug lords are easily taken down. Its like a video game in which guys with guns pop up and are immediately put down.

The episode ends with Thunderbolt Ross talking to an ex-Hydra scientist. The scientist explains to him how Hydra was able to control its operatives. He brings Thunderbolt Ross into a room in which a woman is tied up and sedated. Her name is Jessica Drew. Hydra scientists were able to give her special abilities and use mind control to get her to work for Hydra. Thunderbolt Ross asks if he can fix her. He explains that by fixing her he means reversing the mind control. He further explains that by reversing the mind control he means getting her to work for him.

Episode 2

Some time ago, SHIELD was able to get intel on Hydra and identify all their active bases. The US government sent troops to all these bases in a coordinated attack. It was not without casualties , however. Jessica Drew aka the Spider-Woman was able to take out 
several government agents single handedly.

Jessica was recruited by Hyrda and given an experimental formula based on spider venom. Most of the test subjects didnt survive. Jessica, however, gained the abilities to climb walls and shoot blasts of venomwhich were actually static electric charges that built up in her body over time. She could release the blasts at will most effectively when she came in contact with a person, in which case the blasts could be lethal.

Her costume was bullet proof. Ironically it was tasers that brought her down. She and the other survivors of the assault were imprisoned. Eventually she was brought to Washington. Thunderbolt Ross wanted to get her to work for him.

She was showing signs of progress. She was able to remember her name and who she was. Her back story was similar to that of the Scarlet Witch in that she was from Eastern Europe and her parents were killed in an American airstrike, Ross tells the ex-Hydra scientist to make her forget about that part of her past. Have her instead remember how Hydra turned her into a weapon. Make her believe that it is her job to eliminate similar threats to justice and freedom.

Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye and Marc Spector return from Colombia. He introduces the newest member of their group, the Spider-Woman.

Episode 3

Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye, Marc Spector and Spider-Woman are sent to Madripore, an island in the South China Sea between the Philippines and Malaysia. When they arrive they are greeted by Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter who explain their mission. 

Apparently, Thunderbolt Ross recruited Morse and Hunter after they left SHIELD and sent them to Madripore to determine the degree to which local Muslim terrorists are a threat to Western interests. They requested back up and they got the Thunderbolts.

The Muslim terrorists apparently now have Western hostages, including Americans, Europeans and Japanese. They were apparently on a tour of the area. (God knows why: Boracay would be right next door.) Their orders are to go in and take out the terrorists and rescue the hostages.

Of course, things go wrong: Bullseye kills one of the hostages for fun. The Punisher then kills Bullseye by shooting him in the forehead.

Episode 4

Thunderbolt Ross is pissed. Not only did one of the hostages die but one of the team members is dead. He wants to know what happened.

The whole team vouches for the Punisher. Bullseye went off the deep end, they all say, and he killed one of the hostages. The Punisher saw him as a threat no different from the terrorists. He made a call and the other Thunderbolts all support his decision.

Thunderbolt dismissed them. He talks with the ex-Hydra scientist. The ex-Hydra scientist tells him that the group has shown signs of bonding over the incident. He says they have actually exceeded expectations: he wanted a group of mercenaries but he ended up with a team.

Thunderbolt Ross calls them back in. He tells them that their next mission will be in Egypt. Muslim terrorists again only this time operating from a location that could be a threat to Western interests in Europe.

Episode 5

Marc Spector wakes up in a tomb. A statue of the ancient Egyptian god Khonshu is there with him. He passes out again.

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Marc Spector, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) were sent to Egypt. They attacked the local Muslim terrorist cell but there was an explosion and Marc Spector took the brunt of it. Locals dragged Marc Spectors body away and placed it in the tomb. Perhaps they thought the Egyptian god Khonshu would bring the foreign soldier back to life.

Marc Spector wakes up again. He hears a voice in his head. We dont hear it but he does. He believes it is the voice of Khonshu telling him that he is going to be working for him from now on, that he will be the knight of the moon, the Moon Knight.

Marc Spector wanders out of the cave. He has lost contact with the other Thunderbolts and has no choice but to go to the American embassy. Thunderbolt Ross arranges for him to return to Washington where the rest of the team is waiting for him.

When he arrives back in Washington, Marc Spector tells Ross that he wants out, that he doesnt want to work for Ross anymore.

Episode 6

Marc Spector tells Ross that he has no ill will with Ross or the rest of the team but that he just cant do this anymore. Ross says he understands, that Spector has been through considerable trauma recently and that if he feels it is time for him to retire them the US government will provide him with a healthy severance package. He is provided with a new name and identity: from now on he will be Stephen Grant, resident of Long Island New York. Marc Spector assumes his new identity and moves into his new home. He also gets a job as a New York taxi driver using his real name and a made up resume. People call him Frenchie.

Meanwhile, Thunderbolt Ross tells Bobbi that she is now in charge of the Thunderbolts. She accepts the new position. He tells her that they are to ship out ASAP for Africa. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another problem is that international audiences are more familiar with the movie characters than the TV characters.  A cameo from a TV character would only confuse most movie goers.  One way to work around this problem would be if Avengers 4 (or some other movie) were about the Avengers and / or SHIELD being sent out to investigate people like Daredevil or Luke Cage because their activities were causing enough collateral damage to warrant the attention of the Sokovia Accords.  It wouldn't have to be the main plot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, presumably in the new timeline Black Siren was never captured by Team Flash.  Her history on Earth 2 didn't change but Earth 1 history changed and by time Barry been able to realize that Black Siren was gone his memories had adjusted to the new timeline.  Either that or she escaped just like Doctor Light escaped.  She is now just pretending to be Laurel.  Laurel had been publicly outed as Black Canary after her death so she doesn't have to have Laurel's memories to know Laurel was the Black Canary.  She then has to follow around Team Arrow until she learns the locatio of the Arrow Cave.  The more Team Arrow members there are, the easier it is to believe that she could have followed one of them.  Most of the current Team Arrow wouldn't even recognize Laurel Lance.  As for why she says "Hi, Oliver", obviously she was able to deduce that Oliver Queen was the Green Arrow, either from the location of the Arrow Cave or from knowing that the Green Arrow on Earth 2 was his father who was the only survivor of the Queen's Gambit and who went on to become the Green Arrow while on his Earth it was Oliver.  Oliver said something about her "adjusting" which either means that they are accepting her as Laurel but she has gaps in her memory or they know she is Laurel from another Earth and don't care.

In any case, it makes sense that if she were at large then she would try to take the place of her doppelganger.  Luckily for her her doppelganger was already dead.

Either that or it isn't Black Siren.  I mean, they are going to be suspicious when they find out she is a meta human.  There's no way she would know that Laurel wasn't a meta human.

In any case, her memories of Earth 2 aren't going to change because Earth 2 history wasn't affected by Flashpoint. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's complicated.  Fox has the rights to Batman on TV: I don't think the CW could do their own Batman show.  But Fox couldn't do a Batman movie either.  That being said, if Sony were to put the Kingpin in a Spider-Man movie then Marvel would insist that Vincent D'Onofrio play him.  If he were recast for a Spider-Man movie then fans would be pissed.  Oh and don't forget that Aunt May appeared in Civil War and Iron Man and Happy Hogan are appearing in Spider-Man.  So it isn't just Marvel getting to use Spider-Man: characters (plural) are being shared both ways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In particular, if a Ghost Rider Netflix series were announced for 2018, Daisy could leave Agents of SHIELD and become the female lead on that series.  I see a lot of potential for a Ghost Rider series: Johnny Blaze, Danny Ketch, Blade, Jennifer Kale, Hannibal King, etc.  I wonder what the situation with Abigail Whistler is.  I suspect she is owned by New Line Cinema and not Marvel which would make it difficult if Marvel wanted the Blade movies to be canon to the Netflix series. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have surprisingly good Green Arrow, Flash, Vibe, Firestorm, Atom, Steel, Vixen, Supergirl, Superman and Martian Manhunter characters on the CW.  The trick would be casting a good Batman.  Armie Hammer would be a good choice but rumor has it he is going to play Hal Jordan in the Justice League movie, possibly in an end credit scene.

Here's what I would do.  I would have Arrow Season 6 Episode 5 be entitled "Amazon" and have Wonder Woman make a guest appearance.  Maybe they could bring back Adrianne Palicki and put her in a better costume.  Then have Arrow Season 7 Episode 5 be entitled "Gotham" and have Arrow go to Gotham City and meet Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, etc.  Then they could end the Arrow series with Season 7 and have a new series called "Justice".  Not "Justice League", just "Justice".  They could have stories about the Justice League and flashbacks to the Justice Society.  It would replace both Arrow and Legends.  The Flash would appear on both shows until the Flash also gets cancelled.  That would lead room in the CW schedule for Vixen, Young Justice or Titans shows.

The best case scenario would be for Season 4 of Gotham (on Fox) to be the last season which would then free up the Batman characters to appear on the CW just in time for them to appear on Arrow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It will be interesting to see what happens after the Defenders series.  We know that Luke Cage will get a second season and we can surmise by the actor's suggestion that they have a "Heroes for Hire" plot that Danny Rand will be part of Season 2.  So what happens if there is a second season of Iron Fist?  Will Luke Cage appear in Iron Fist Season 2?  And because Jessica Jones Season 2 will follow the Defenders, will characters from the Defenders series appear in Jessica Jones?  

To hear the Marvel / Netflix people talk, Defenders is an ongoing series with 21-26 episodes a year and Punisher is a spin off.  The Defenders is broken into 8-13 episode seasons with different showrunners and different main villains.  

Netflix is even open to the possibility of more spin offs.  Ghost Rider may be announced as a series soon.  Thunderbolts could star the Punisher, Elektra and others.  I'm sure they will do an Agent Carter / Ant Man series eventually, although it might not be until Hayley Atwell is old enough to play an older Agent Carter without make up.

Most likely, Inhumans will take the 10:00 time slot and Agents of SHIELD will take over that time slot in January (assuming the entire Inhumans series is reran during the mid-season break).  We would then have a shorter season of Agents of SHIELD, say sixteen episodes.  

Alternatively, they could put Inhumans on at 9:00 and have it compete with Legends of Tomorrow.  Or they could put Inhumans at 8:00 and move Agents of SHIELD to 9:00.  I don't see why they would do that though: fans of both CW DC TV and ABC Marvel TV would be pissed that they would have to DVR one or the other and not be able to see everything live.

Anyway, it is time to introduce Vampires to the Marvel Universe.  Maybe they can bring back Ghost Rider next season too.  They could have Hannibal King team up with Robbie Reyes and then save old school Blade and Johnny Blaze for a Netflix spin off. </TEXT>

HARE TWEET

x-men-spinoff-movie-new-mutants-slice

20th Century Foxs X-Men franchise may be in the process of being reconfigured, but the studio is wasting no time moving on to the next chapter. A new report has revealed that the next X-Men film will begin filming next May in Montreal, and director Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars) dropped a pretty clear hint that that movie is going to be New Mutants.

A report in Le Journal de Montreal revealed that the production office for the next X-Men office is already set at MELS Studios with set construction beginning in January. Michel Trudel, the president of MELS confirmed, They will start shooting in May and they will occupy Studios 2 and 3 of MELS for several months. While the report didnt explicitly state which X-Men film will film next year, Boone retweeted Den of Geeks coverage of the story with the note Hmmmm, what movie could it be? So yeah, its probably New Mutants.

And that makes sense. Fox finds themselves at a bit of a crossroads with their long-running mutant verse. Its a cash cow, earning them more than $4 billion, worldwide, but this years release, Bryan Singers X-Men: Apocalypse, was met with critically and commercially disappointing results, earning only $544 million worldwide to Days of Future Pasts $748. On top of that, X-Men stars Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Nicholas Hoult have reached the end of their three-picture contracts, and if the studio wants them to re-up, its going to be costly, and the long-planned Gambit movie has yet to come together again after losing two directors.

Meanwhile, Boone has been hard at work on New Mutants alongside his The Fault in Our Stars screenwriting duo Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. The film adaptation will reportedly have a YA tone and feature the mutants Wolfsbane, Magik, Sunspot, Danielle Moonstar, Mirage, and Cannonball. Theyll also be joined by Professor X and, if early reports are to be believed, Alexandra Shipps young Storm, who was introduced in X-Men: Apocalypse.

New Mutants doesnt have a confirmed release date, but after a recent release date shakeup, the next Untitled Marvel/Fox Film is scheduled for March 2, 2018. </TEXT>

With the success of Deadpool earlier this year, 20th Century Fox successfully launched a new X-Men spinoff that is directly related to the franchise as it exists nowie. in a post-Days of Future Past world. While this months X-Men: Apocalypse takes place decades before the events of Deadpool, in 1983, the possibilities for further expansion of the X-Men universe remains, and indeed it sounds like the next spinoff could very well be the long-gestating The New Mutants.

An adaptation of the Chris Claremont and Bob McLeod teen-skewing X-Men spinoff has been in the works for a few years now, with Fox signing The Fault in Our Stars director Josh Boone to co-write and direct last May. Boone recently teased which mutants he plans to include in the film and turned in his second draft of the script in April, so it certainly sounds like this thing is moving forward sooner rather than later.

Indeed, when Colliders own Steve Weintraub recently sat down with producer/writer Simon Kinberg at the press day for X-Men: Apocalypse, Kinberg revealed that the hope is that New Mutants starts filming at the beginning of next year. Moreover, Kinberg revealed one key X-Men character who will likely be involved in the New Mutants movie, assuming this aspect of the script is maintained throughout development:

    Right now, as the movie exists, Professor X would be a part of a New Mutants movie.

After the smashing success of Fault in Our Stars, Boone became incredibly busy, signing on to write and direct an adaptation of The Stand that has seen more ups and downs than a mall elevator over the past couple of years. The Stand is currently in a holding pattern as rights issues are worked out, so Boone is currently gearing up to direct the Stephen King adaptation Revival this year while also working on the script for Interview with the Vampire, which he also intends to direct. But with Kinberg eyeing early 2017 as a potential start date for New Mutants, it sounds like the X-Men spinoff could be Boones next movie after Revival.

The New Mutants comic is a younger-skewing X-Men spinoff focusing on teenaged mutants at Professor Xaviers School for the Gifted. Its unclear if the Professor X of the New Mutants movie would be McAvoy or Patrick Stewart, depending on what time period the film takes place in, but with Kinberg recently revealing that the next X-Men movie will take place in the 90s, and with New Mutants eyed for an early 2017 start, it sounds like New Mutants could very well be the 90s-set feature with McAvoy in a key role.

And to be honest, New Mutants is probably the smartest choice for Fox post-Apocalypse. Letting the main franchise take a bit of a breather while some fresh blood is brought into the series via Boone could open up a bevy of new avenues for the X-Men universe, just as Deadpool is paving the way for an X-Force movie down the line. So heres hoping the schedules align and Boone does indeed turn his attention to New Mutants later this year.

Look for more from Steves X-Men: Apocalypse interviews on Collider soon. The film opens in theaters on May 27th. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually don't mind the movie take.  The TV takes have usually been corny.  Smallville played the character straight but Tom Welling never played Superman: he was always Clark Kent.  The movie take basically  deals with Clark always feeling alienated from humanity, first because he had powers and later because he found out he was literally an alien.  I actually have more of a problem with the movie's Johnathon Kent never wanting Clark to use his powers.  Yes, by all means, don't let people know that you have superpowers but don't let people die if you can save them.  It's kind of the opposite of Uncle Ben's "With great power comes great responsibility speech".  I feel the same way about the Martha Kent line "You don't owe these people anything".  Maybe it makes more sense in the extended cut but it seems as though the Kents were setting Clark up to be at conflict with humanity rather than having him be a savior, which is the opposite to how the Kents were portrayed in the comics or in previous live action iterations.  Clark got his humanity and his desire to help others from the Kents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's an actual interview with Feige.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-03/kevin-feige-marvels-superhero-at-running-movie-franchises#p3

"As Feige consumed stacks of Marvel comics, he wondered why others working on X-Men didnt do the same. I would hear people, other executives, struggling over a character point, or struggling over how to make a connection, or struggling over how to give even surface-level depth to an action scene or to a character, Feige recalls. Id be sitting there reading the comics going, Look at this. Just do this. This is incredible."

"Finally, Marvel decided to create its own studio. In 2005 it put up as collateral the film rights to characters it still controlled, such as Captain America and Nick Fury, and got $525 million in financing from Merrill Lynch. Arad, who had doubts about the strategy, resigned the following year.  Feige was named studio chief in 2007." </TEXT>

"While attending the University of Southern California in the 1990s, Mr. Feige got an internship with the producer Lauren Shuler Donner, who hired him as an assistant after graduation. He helped her with projects like Youve Got Mail  he was assigned to teach Meg Ryan how to use e-mail  and, when she started working on the X-Men movies, made Mr. Feige a producer.

"As a walking encyclopedia of Marvel, he was really indispensable in those early days, Ms. Donner said. (Pressed to name one of Mr. Feiges faults, Ms. Donner finally said, O.K., neatness is not his forte.)" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kevin Feige had already read comics when he was hired to work on the first X-Men movie.  When producers were talking about what stories they could do, Kevin Feige started telling them about stories from the comics.  He also started handing out comics to cast and crew to let them know what they should be trying to achieve.

Shortly after the moderate success of the first Hulk movie, Feige suggested making an Iron Man movie using Marvel's share of the profits from the X-Men and Spider-Man movies.  He said that if the Iron Man movie were successful they could do Captain America and Thor movies and then have a movie with Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor together.  Ari Arad was against the idea so Ari was promptly fired by Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige was hired as the studio head.

Kevin Feige had a clear vision for Phases 1, 2 and 3 right at the start but, at the time, he didn't know where they would go after that.  To be fair, they probably wouldn't have gone ahead with Guardians of the Galaxy without James Gunn.  But Kevin Feige knew that they had to introduce infinity gems in Phases 1, 2 and 3 and not have Thanos appear with a complete gauntlet at the start of Avengers 3.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is slightly more complicated than that.  Due to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics we see that every possible future event will happen.  Because every possible future event happens in a predictable manner, there is no free will but because we only experience one world we have the illusion of free will.  That is, to us, it seems that our decisions are affecting future outcomes when in reality there are alternative versions of ourselves that are experiencing different futures.  Presumably the different futures only differ superficially.  For example, in five billion years our sun will explode no matter what we do.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So rumor has it that when they were putting the team together the writers thought "Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Atom, Canary... shit this is the Justice Society!  That should be the title of the show!" so they told Warner Brothers that they wanted to do the Justice Society (which the CW already had rights to after Smallville) but people at Warners said "You can't do that because there is going to be a Justice League movie" and the writers tried to explain "No, Justice *Society*" but the suits still said no and for a long time the show was being developed without a title.

Anyway, in Season 2, they did the Justice Society anyway and starting with this weeks the Flash we have an actual Justice League on TV.  So you can pretend that Legends of Tomorrow is an actual Justice League show, that they've moved on from Justice Society and they're now doing Justice League. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a perfect world, we would have this:

2017: Iron Fist, Punisher, Defenders

2018: Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Ghost Rider

2019: Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Thunderbolts

2020: Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Blade

2021: Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Punisher

2022: Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Nightstalkers

2023: Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Elektra

At this point, if all series have proven themselves they can step up production to four seasons a year.

2024: Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Ghost Rider, Punisher

2025: Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Blade, Elektra

etc.

The Thunderbolts would be Punisher, Elektra, Moon Knight and Spider-Woman with other supporting characters.  The Nightstalkers would be Blade, Johnny Blaze, Robbie Reyes and Hannibal King with other supporting characters.

I think they would have one season of Defenders, one season of Thunderbolts and one season of Nightstalkers.  I think the Defenders is considered an "event" and not an ongoing series.

Spider-Woman or Moon Knight could get their own series to replace Blade, Ghost Rider or Elektra.  There's no guarantee they would be hits.

Johnny Blaze Ghost Rider had a blink-and-you-missed-it cameo on Agents of SHIELD.  Rumor has it that they want Nicholas Cage to appear as Johnny Blaze and have Robbie Reyes be the main character going forward.

Another rumor (from Wesley Snipes himself) is that they want Wesley Snipes to reprise his role as Blade but "they aren't confident" in his ability to do action so they want him to be a mentor to a younger character.  A leak from Marvel revealed that they were thinking of introducing Blade's daughter in the comics.

I think it would make more sense to introduce Hannibal King on Agents of SHIELD next season and he can talk about how Vampires have returned and how his partner Blade is "busy elsewhere".  That would establish that Blade exists.  Get a young, fit actor to play Hannibal King and have him do his own stunts and a stand in can play Blade most of the time.  That was how they filmed Blade Trinity.

EDIT: Alternative plan.

2017: Iron Fist, Punisher, Defenders

2018: Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Ghost Rider

2019: Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Thunderbolts

2020: Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Blade, Moon Knight

2021: Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Punisher, Elektra

2022: Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Spider-Woman, Nightstalkers

2023: Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Punisher, Elektra

2024: Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Moon Knight, Spider-Woman

2025: Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Punisher, Elektra

etc

with Ghost Rider - Blade - Nightstalkers being more of an event to satisfy fans and bring back the actors in their iconic roles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, Moon Knight was introduced in the 70s but he didn't get his own title until the 80s.  Then there's She-Hulk.

Who is left from the sixties and seventies?  Spider-Woman came out in the seventies.  Nova came out in the seventies.  Quasar was originally Marvel Boy and I think he dates back to the sixties.  I think we've exhausted most of the sixties characters with the exception of Hercules and Namor.

Then there's the horror genre.  We all want to see a Blade / Ghost Rider team up.  I think there are people at Marvel who would like to see Nicholas Cage and Wesley Snipes return.  They could then pass the mantle to younger actors to whom they are introduced as mentors.  We already have that with Ghost Rider on Agents of SHIELD.

I think it is fair to say that Marvel has been placing a priority on characters from the sixties and seventies.  Marvel knows that comics don't sell as well as they used to.  The people who are reading comics right now are a small market.  So they are going to go with Spider-Woman, Blade, Nova, Quasar, Moon Knight and She-Hulk.

There's also the question of new supporting characters.  We can expect Doctor Druid and Brother Voodoo to appear eventually.  I kind of hope Tina Minoru appears in Doctor Strange II.  There are relatively few Asian characters in the Marvel movies.   </TEXT>

Robert Downey Jr. himself revealed in April that he wants to "retire" his Iron Man character and, unless he goes back to the bargaining table with Marvel, that may very well happen with The Avengers 3. The actor will be 53 years old when that sequel hits theaters in 2019.

http://movieweb.com/avengers-4-infinity-war-part-2-why-title-change/

The Russo brothers are currently promoting the release of Captain America: Civil War on Blu-ray and DVD and recently spoke with CinemaBlend. During the course of the interview, the subject of the recent name change for the new Avengers movies came up. While they didn't divulge and overly specific information, or state what Avengers 4 will be titled yet, they did address the change, saying that the two movies are going to be very different from one another, but will still share plenty of connective tissue. Here is what Joe Russo had to say.

"We wanted the movie to be very different and distinctive, you know. There's certainly cross-pollination between characters and some story-arcs, but you know, the first movie is very clearly Avengers: Infinity War and, in time, we will reveal what the second film is." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the way to do this is to try to figure out who the Avengers will be in Phase 4.

First of all, Captain America and Iron Man. These guys have been the focus of eight movies already. Even if the actors weren't expensive, we are going to want to shift the focus to younger actors who can lead their own franchises in the future.

Captain America is going to have a role in the newly reformed SHIELD. Perhaps Jeffrey Mace steps down as Director of SHIELD and Captain America becomes Director of SHIELD. He would take over the role in the movies previously filled by Nick Fury. They might even be able to finally get a Captain America cameo on Agents of SHIELD.

Tony Stark in the comics became Secretary of Defense. 2016 was an election year and if President Ellis did not get re-elected then Thunderbolt Ross is probably not Secretary of State so Tony Stark could take over that role. It does seem silly though making the one person who needs the most oversight the actual overseer.

Black Widow is supposed to be getting her own movie in Phase 4. Most likely it will involve aliens or time travel or aliens and time travel and it will set up the next major Avengers movie. If Ghost in the Shell becomes a franchise then she could be busy. Expect a Black Widow movie, if it happens, to be a one off, not because she isn't popular but because there aren't a lot of good Black Widow stories from the comics.

Captain Marvel's movie, if successful, will become a trilogy. It is very unlikely that they will introduce her and immediately kill her off so expect her to be around for a while.

Ant Man and the Wasp will also be in the New Avengers. Marvel likes making trilogies so imagine Ant Man 3 will have Taskmaster as the villain (if he is not already slated to appear in Ant Man and the Wasp). Another possible villain would be Egghead. Better yet, they could have Egghead be the villain for the flashbacks with Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne and then have Egghead appear at the end as an old man and have him be behind whatever problem they face in present day.

War Machine will stay in the Avengers. In case you missed it, Rhodey was walking at the end of Civil War and even if he is limping for the rest of his life, he doesn't need his legs to operated the War Machine suit.

Falcon, likewise, will remain in the New Avengers. I don't expect Winter Soldier to return. He is a bit of a one note character, what with his metal arm and all. Yes, it might be good to see him redeemed but he also deserves a chance at a normal life.

Tom Holland is signed on for two more Spider-Man movies after Homecoming but the actor is still young so I suspect he could do as many as nine Spider-Man movies when all is said and done, not including Spider-Man centric Avengers movies. Most likely though the MCU will get rebooted after he's done just six solo movies so they can do more movies with Spider-Man in high school (and with what will by then be a cheaper actor).

Nova and/or Quasar will probably be introduced during Infinity War. If they are both introduced then they will complete the roster of the New Avengers for now, although obviously they could add characters like Ms. Marvel later.

Dr. Cho and Prof. Selvig will remain as supporting characters. Jane Foster and her friends won't be seen again.

Thor will probably stay in Asgard and it makes sense for the Hulk to also stay in Asgard. The Hulk is probably still wanted for what happened in Johannesburg. Most likely if Hulk and Thor appear again it will be because Doctor Strange went to Asgard to get them.

Doctor Strange 2 is supposedly going to feature Nightmare. Doctor Strange 3 may very well have Dormammu return and Doctor Strange will call on the help of the Avengers including Hulk and Thor. It would be good if they could also have Namor appear. If you've read any Marvel comics from the seventies then you know why.

Valkyrie is going to appear in Thor Ragnarok along with Thor, Hulk and Doctor Strange. She is also a major character from the seventies.

The New Avengers are a bit crowded so I can see Hawkeye hanging out with Doctor Strange. First of all, I can see Hawkeye, as a SHIELD agent, being asked to look into this magic stuff that Doctor Strange is doing. Expect a lot of reaction shots from Jeremy Renner when Doctor Strange does cool stuff.

Similarly, the Black Panther is the king of Wakanda. He isn't going to hang out in New York with the New Avengers. If anything, Doctor Strange will go grab him when he is needed.

She-Hulk is a character that can join Doctor Strange's Mighty Avengers. Basically, the Leader will use Bruce Banner's blood to make Hulks but Jennifer Walters will fight on the side of good.

Scarlet Witch may seek out Strange's help to control her powers. It isn't clear if her magic is really different from Doctor Strange's magic. Presumably he and Wong can teach her to do new things.

Tina Minoru, if she didn't die off screen in Doctor Strange, could potentially be one of the Mighty Avengers. She would take the place of Clea and could potentially be a love interest for Doctor Strange. She could also be the guardian of the Hong Kong Sanctum and thus Strange's equal. We also don't know who the new guardian of the London Sanctum will be. It could be Doctor Druid or it could be Brother Voodoo. My vote is for Doctor Druid and have Brother Voodoo show up in some other capacity.

Sif, Heimdall, the Warriors Three and the Guardians of the Galaxy would show up as supporting characters in future films.

Future MCU storylines could involve a Fisk presidency, an Osborn presidency, the Skrulls, Korvac, Avengers from the future coming back in time or a Kree / Xandar war.

There's also the question of who gets what Infinity Stone after Avengers: Infinity War. I imagine Strange keeps the time stone, Asgard gets back the stone from the tesseract, Captain Marvel keeps a stone, the Guardians keep a stone and the other two stone would most likely be guarded by Tina Minoru (if she's still alive) and Doctor Druid. They could also rebuild the Vision and have him guard the Mind Stone. I think killing the Vision in Infinity Wars and then using the Infinity Stones to rebuild the Vision creates the feeling that there are no consequences. You would also have to ask why the Scarlet Witch would bring back the Vision and not Quicksilver.

It would be cool if Gaurdians 3 ended with the Guardians using an Infinity Stone to freeze the Kree and Xandar armies and then send them back to their respective planets so that they can give negotiations a chance. Of course, that begs the question as to why they were fighting in the first place. Why were they fighting in the past? What were the issues?

Eventually, the current actors will become too old. There's no need to panic however. Feige seems bound and determined to tell all the old Avengers stories from the past. The TV shows are rapidly becoming their own thing. The most likely TV / movie crossover would be to have Wilson Fisk and Norman Osborn working together. Or maybe they will be trying to take each other out. Just don't expect a movie with hundreds of characters because it just wouldn't be worth the effort. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Giordano Bruno (Italian: [dordano bruno]; Latin: Iordanus Brunus Nolanus; 1548  17 February 1600), born Filippo Bruno, was an Italian Dominican friar, philosopher, mathematician, poet, and astrologer.[3] He is remembered for his cosmological theories, which conceptually extended the then novel Copernican model. He proposed that the stars were just distant suns surrounded by their own exoplanets and raised the possibility that these planets could even foster life of their own (a philosophical position known as cosmic pluralism). He also insisted that the universe is in fact infinite and could have no celestial body at its "center".

Beginning in 1593, Bruno was tried for heresy by the Roman Inquisition on charges including denial of several core Catholic doctrines, including eternal damnation, the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, the virginity of Mary, and transubstantiation. Bruno's pantheism was also a matter of grave concern.[4] The Inquisition found him guilty, and he was burned at the stake in Rome's Campo de' Fiori in 1600. After his death, he gained considerable fame, being particularly celebrated by 19th- and early 20th-century commentators who regarded him as a martyr for science,[5] although historians have debated the extent to which his heresy trial was a response to his astronomical views or to other aspects of his philosophy and theology.[6][7][8][9][10] Bruno's case is still considered a landmark in the history of free thought and the emerging sciences.[11][12][13] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We literally have no idea what Avengers 4 is about.  There has been some speculation about the Avengers forming a new team and that the title would be New Avengers or Avengers Initiative.  Others have pointed out that the movie could deal with the fallout from Infinity War and deal with the question of what to do with the Infinity Stones and the title could be Avengers: Infinity Watch or Avengers: Illuminati.  Or it could be a combination of the two with the title still undetermined.  In any case, I would not expect Daredevil to appear in Infinity War.  Why?  Because when Thanos attacks Earth they are not going to be looking for the help of an ordinary human with enhanced fighting skills.  Thus Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Elektra, the Punisher and Colleen Wing will all sit Infinity War out.  

On the other hand, there's the question of whether or not the Defenders Netflix series features an event that would place the Defenders under the jurisdiction of the Sokovia accords.  Even then, an Agents of SHIELD / Defenders crossover seems more likely than an Avengers / Defenders crossover.  The real problem is that ABC TV isn't going to pay to have Daredevil and the Black Widow both appear on Agents of SHIELD.  I think Scarlett Johansson's view is that if they have her appear on Netflix or ABC then she's missing out on the big paycheck that comes with a movie appearance.  Maybe if they gave Black Widow her own movie then she would agree to appear on either Netflix or ABC TV.  That would be easier than trying to shoehorn Daredevil into a two hour movie.  </TEXT>

You have the original trilogy (X-Men, X2, X3), the prequels (First Class, DOFP, Apocalypse), the solo films (Origins, Wolverine, Logan, Deadpool) and the movies with a new younger cast (New Mutants).  Like the Star Wars films, the X-Men movies should not be viewed as individual movies but as a saga.

	<TEXT> Episode 9

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) return to Washington and are surprised to see Marc Spector. Thunderbolt Ross tells them that Spector has overheard intel concerning a plot to bring a nuclear weapon from Kazakhstan to the U.S. He says that the information is limited so the Thunderbolts are going to be on call until the CIA is able to investigate the veracity of this information. He tells them that they are to enjoy a little bit of R R but to not go too far away and stay in touch.

So, yeah, its anti-heros night out. Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Marc Spector, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter all go out together for a night on the town. And it isnt the slightest bit suspicious because they are three men and three women. Shippers will be wetting their pants and, yes, Elektra and the Punisher do get a hotel room and end up in bed together as do Spider-Woman and Marc Spector and Bobbi and Hunter. Bobbi and Hunter are married so its no big deal. Jessica and Marc discuss how they are both compelled to do things and how it is making each of them a little bit crazy.

Episode 10

Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Marc Spector, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter are called in by Thunderbolt Ross. Apparently he has new intel.

The big bad is Igor Stravinsky. His group is known as Leviathan. 
They had ties to the KGB and the Black Widow program and perhaps even the Soviet Winter Soldier program. He tells them that they will need to expect to face enhanced individuals. Their weapons may be useless. They need to train as they have never trained before.

Bobbi organizes time in a gym. The Thunderbolts are trained in hand to hand combat. As most of them are ex-military. this is nothing new to them but Bobbi tells them that the object of this exercise is to have everybody learn from each other.

Thunderbolt Ross calls them in again. The CIA has credible intel as to the bombs location are to be shipped out ASAP.

Episode 11

Igor Stravinsky was, of course, a member of Hydra and was involved in the Winter Soldier program. Sebastian Stan appears as the Winter Soldier. We see the Winter Soldier sent out on a mission by Stravinsky. Scarlett Johansson may cameo as the Black Widow.

Years later, after the fall of Hydra, Igor joined Leviathan. They wanted Igor to provide them with super soldiers of their own. They have many recruits. Not all of them survive but he manages to produce a six member team of super soldiers who are all capable of surviving conventional attacks.

Episode 12

The Thunderbolts arrive in Kazakhstan and meet with the local CIA team. They explain to them exactly where the bomb is being hidden and how it is being protected. The CIA operatives explain that they will assist them in penetrating the facility.

The Thunderbolts get past the Leviathan guards. Now they must face the Leviathan super soldiers.

Episode 13

As Ross predicted, guns, knives and batons are not effective against the super soldiers. Venom blasts turn out to be very effective, however, but even at close range they do not kill, only weaken, and Spider-Woman needs time to recharge. Thus the battle rages on for most of the episode.

Ultimately, the Tunderbolts are successful and the CIA takes possession of the nuclear bomb. Obviously the bomb will have to be turned over to the Soviets but the actual terms under which the bomb is returned will have to be negotiated. After all, the Soviets dont want to have it come out that they allowed a nuclear weapon to fall into the hands of domestic terrorists.

The Thunderbolts return back to Washington. Drug lords in Colombia are dead, hostages were rescued in South East Asia and Africa, terror threats in Egypt and Kazakhstan were eliminated. And yet their names stayed out of the newspapers. Officially, they are all in prison. That means they have done their jobs.

Thunderbolts 2 has either Wilson Fisk or Norman Osborne as president and the Punisher wants to assassinate him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Punisher series ends with the Punisher going to jail. 
Meanwhile, Elektra is brought back to life in the Defenders and Bullseye is introduced and imprisoned at the end of Daredevil Season 3. Each series ends with Thunderbolt Ross propositioning them to join the Thunderbolts.

Episode 1

The episode begins mid res. Elektra, the Punisher, Bullseye and Marc Spector are fighting drug lords in South America.

One week ago, Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye and Marc Spector were recruited by Thunderbolt Ross. They were to be his special ops team. Under no circumstances were they to ever tell anyone who they were working for: their actions overseas will violate international laws and perhaps even be considered acts of war by the US government against the local countries. In particular, their actions could be seen as violating the Sokovia Accords because their abilities are arguably superhuman, But fuck the accords because they were just a way to rein in the Avengers and SHIELD. The United States always has and always will carry out covert missions overseas.

Their first mission: to take out a group of drug lords in Colombia.
The drug lords are easily taken down. Its like a video game in which guys with guns pop up and are immediately put down.

The episode ends with Thunderbolt Ross talking to an ex-Hydra scientist. The scientist explains to him how Hydra was able to control its operatives. He brings Thunderbolt Ross into a room in which a woman is tied up and sedated. Her name is Jessica Drew. Hydra scientists were able to give her special abilities and use mind control to get her to work for Hydra. Thunderbolt Ross asks if he can fix her. He explains that by fixing her he means reversing the mind control. He further explains that by reversing the mind control he means getting her to work for him.

Episode 2

Some time ago, SHIELD was able to get intel on Hydra and identify all their active bases. The US government sent troops to all these bases in a coordinated attack. It was not without casualties , however. Jessica Drew aka the Spider-Woman was able to take out several government agents single handedly.

Jessica was recruited by Hyrda and given an experimental formula based on spider venom. Most of the test subjects didnt survive. Jessica, however, gained the abilities to climb walls and shoot blasts of venomwhich were actually static electric charges that built up in her body over time. She could release the blasts at will most effectively when she came in contact with a person, in which case the blasts could be lethal.

Her costume was bullet proof. Ironically it was tasers that brought her down. She and the other survivors of the assault were imprisoned. Eventually she was brought to Washington. Thunderbolt Ross wanted to get her to work for him.

She was showing signs of progress. She was able to remember her name and who she was. Her back story was similar to that of the Scarlet Witch in that she was from Eastern Europe and her parents were killed in an American airstrike, Ross tells the ex-Hydra scientist to make her forget about that part of her past. Have her instead remember how Hydra turned her into a weapon. Make her believe that it is her job to eliminate similar threats to justice and freedom.

Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye and Marc Spector return from Colombia. He introduces the newest member of their group, the Spider-Woman.

Episode 3

Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye, Marc Spector and Spider-Woman are sent to Madripore, an island in the South China Sea between the Philippines and Malaysia. When they arrive they are greeted by Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter who explain their mission. 

Apparently, Thunderbolt Ross recruited Morse and Hunter after they left SHIELD and sent them to Madripore to determine the degree to which local Muslim terrorists are a threat to Western interests. They requested back up and they got the Tunderbolts.

The Muslim terrorists apparently now have Western hostages, including Americans, Europeans and Japanese. They were apparently on a tour of the area. (God knows why: Boracay would be right next door.) Their orders are to go in and take out the terrorists and rescue the hostages.

Of course, things go wrong: Bullseye kills one of the hostages for fun. The Punisher then kills Bullseye by shooting him in the forehead.

Episode 4

Thunderbolt Ross is pissed. Not only did one of the hostages die but one of the team members is dead. He wants to know what happened.

The whole team vouches for the Punisher. Bullseye went off the deep end, they all say, and he killed one of the hostages. The Punisher saw him as a threat no different from the terrorists. He made a call and the other Thunderbolts all support his decision.

Thunderbolt dismissed them. He talks with the ex-Hydra scientist. The ex-Hydra scientist tells him that the group has shown signs of bonding over the incident. He says they have actually exceeded expectations: he wanted a group of mercenaries but he ended up with a team.

Thunderbolt Ross calls them back in. He tells them that their next mission will be in Egypt. Muslim terrorists again only this time operating from a location that could be a threat to Western interests in Europe.

Episode 5

Marc Spector wakes up in a tomb. A statue of the ancient Egyptian god Khonshu is there with him. He passes out again.

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Marc Spector, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) were sent to Egypt. They attacked the local Muslim terrorist cell but there was an explosion and Marc Spector took the brunt of it. Locals dragged Marc Spectors body away and placed it in the tomb. Perhaps they thought the Egyptian god Khonshu would bring the foreign soldier back to life.

Marc Spector wakes up again. He hears a voice in his head. We dont hear it but he does. He believes it is the voice of Khonshu telling him that he is going to be working for him from now on, that he will be the knight of the moon, the Moon Knight.

Marc Spector wanders out of the cave. He has lost contact with the other Thunderbolts and has no choice but to go to the American embassy. Thunderbolt Ross arranges for him to return to Washington where the rest of the team is waiting for him.
When he arrives back in Washington, Marc Spector tells Ross that he wants out, that he doesnt want to work for Ross anymore.

Episode 6

Marc Spector tells Ross that he has no ill will with Ross or the rest of the team but that he just cant do this anymore. Ross says he understands, that Spector has been through considerable trauma recently and that if he feels it is time for him to retire them the US government will provide him with a healthy severance package. He is provided with a new name and identity: from now on he will be Stephen Grant, resident of Long Island New York. Marc Spector assumes his new identity and moves into his new home. He also gets a job as a New York taxi driver using his real name and a made up resume. People call him Frenchie.

Meanwhile, Thunderbolt Ross tells Bobbi that she is now in charge of the Thunderbots. She accepts the new position. He tells her that they are to ship out ASAP for Africa.

Episode 7

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) travel to Lagos, Nigeria and meet with their local mission specialist, Jerico Drumm. In the comics, Jerico Drumm is known as Brother Voodoo but here is just an expert on ancient African religions. Apparently, local girls have been kidnapped by one of these cults. They are being used as sex slaves. The government isnt equipped to deal with them. 
Thunderbolt is sending the Thunderbolts in exchange for valuable trade benefits for the United States.

Meanwhile, Marc Spector goes to work driving his taxi in the worst parts of New York. In his taxi, hi picks up drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes. He hears things. On some nights, he doesnt go out as Frenchie. Instead, he goes out as Moon Knight. He doesnt have a cape: he just has a white suit and a white mask. He also doesnt want to drive one of Steven Grants cars so he drives his taxi and hopes that nobody ntioces Frenchie wearing a white suit. He then pulls the taxi over, gets out and puts on his Moon Knight mask. Some criminals are going to get their ass whooped.

Episode 8

Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter are being briefed by Jerico Drumm. Apparently they have learned where the cult is keeping the young girls. Bobbi Morse tells the team that this is to be a stealth mission. She doesnt want a single hostage to lose her life this time.

Marc Spector is driving his taxi again. He picks up Russian men. Marc puts on a thick French accent. The two Russians get into the cab and start talking as though he wasnteven there. Marc hears something about a nuclear weapon in Kazakhstan. They say that they are investigating different options as to how to smuggle it out of Kazakhstan and use it against the United States.

The Thunderbolts rescue the young girls and the young girls are returned to their parents. Of course, a lot of cult members get killed: they get stabbed, shot, blasted and hit over the head with batons. But it all happens so quickly that none of the girls get hurt.

Meanwhile, in Washington, Spector shows up in Rosss office. He says he wants back in.

	<TEXT> Yeah, if only Marvel could do what DC is doing and have characters from four different shows come together and form a team. :)

Seriously though, I think we are going to see some Netflix / ABC TV crossovers soon.  The problem is scheduling: Netflix series drop all at once so it would be hard to have a story that crosses from Agents of SHIELD into, say, Defenders and then back into Agents of SHIELD.  

Did you hear the rumor that Marvel TV asked Nicholas Cage to reprise his role as Johnny Blaze and Nicholas Cage said "No"?  That makes me wonder if they can't do a Johnny Blaze / Blade crossover series on Netflix as a spin off of Agents of SHIELD and bring back both Nicholas Cage and Wesley Snipes.  Wesley Snipes has talked about reprising his role as Blade but having him be a mentor.  I would be up for one last hurrah with Johnny Blaze and Blade in which they pass the torch to younger characters like Robbie Reyes. </TEXT>

"Marvel director Scott Derrickson told IGN what he'd most like to explore in a Doctor Strange sequel.

"When asked what elements from source comics hed most want to feature in another movie, Derrickson said:

"I really like the character of Nightmare and the concept that the Nightmare Realm is a dimension. [...] Thats early  thats like the first Strange tale. I think thats in the introductory episode of Doctor Strange, and I always loved that."

"Nightmare did, indeed, first appear alongside the debut of Doctor Strange in Strange Tales #110 (July, 1963). He is the despotic ruler of the Dream Dimension, where humans visit while sleeping, has green hair and a black, horned horse named Dreamstalker. Who wouldnt want to see that in a movie?

"Derrickson also went on to say why the character wasn't used as a villain in Strange's first cinematic outing:

"We decided not to do that because thats a bit of a complex idea to try to introduce everything we do introduce and introduce the idea of nightmares themselves as being a dimension. I hope somewhere down the line we do get to explore that because I think thats super cool concept." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the same with Koreans and Chinese.  Some people are surprisingly dark.  This is usually associated with people living in rural areas.  My Filipino wife says that people with dark skin "look like they are from the mountains".  Don't forget that Asia is different from America: many people live in areas where their ancestors lived hundreds of years ago.  That's plenty of time to allow for not only interbreeding but also natural selection.  After many generations, farmers selectively adapt to resist sun burn.  

Another consideration is cosmetics.  Look at Asian kids.  They are darker than their parents, especially their mothers.  My wife literally goes through bottles of skin whitening cream.  Some women even pay to have their skin "bleached".  Because dark skin is associated with a rural lifestyle and lower income and education, light skin is considered the standard of beauty in Asia.  Asian people tend to react negatively to black people even going so far as to think they look dirty.

Some women buck the trend.  For example, Asian women visiting America have noticed that Asian women with tans get more attention than those who don't and thus they might want to hang out at a beach or go to a tanning salon.  They may be criticized back home when returning from an overseas vacation with a tan.  Women in Asia tend to use umbrellas in the sun.  My wife even told our daughter not to play in the sun lest she "turn black". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, they will probably do six episodes of Inhumans and at about 17-18 episodes of Agents of SHIELD and then show the first two episodes of Inhumans when they show reruns.  

Hopefully, Agent Carter can return in 2019. </TEXT>

Marvel Has Plans for Possible Ghost Rider Netflix Series or Movie

Ghost Rider has made a big comeback thanks to Agents of SHIELD season 4, with actor Gabriel Luna making the new Robbie Reyes version of The Rider a household name. Marvel fans have been so pleased with the reboot that there have been continuous calls to see the new Ghost Rider branch out wider into the Marvel Cinematic Universe - with the most common suggestion being that the character should headline his own Netflix series. 

We here at Comicbook.com had the opportunity to speak with Gabriel Luna (see the video above), and ask about whether a Ghost Rider getting his own Netflix series was even a possibility. According to Luna, it's more than a possibility: there's already structure in place to make it happen. 

Ghost Rider Marvel Movie Netflix Series Gabriel Luna
Regarding how Ghost Rider transitions from Agents of SHIELD to his own solo venture, Luna told us, "I don't have a preference. People talk about 'Ah man he'd be great as a feature,' which is [an] idea too... It could be in the cinema, it could live on Netflix, whatever it is."

Getting a little bit more concrete, Luna revealed to us that Marvel Studios has (of course) plotted out the potential for a new Ghost Rider franchise, and has those pathways already structured:

"It's been talked about, there's definitely deals in place for that potential. But I just take it one day at a time. I have so much fun now I just want to make sure I get these episodes right. If they throw more episodes on my plate, I will do my best to do well with those stories as well."

Marvel fans, would you like to see Luna's Ghost Rider get another shot at a movie franchise? Or (like us) are you hungry for a dark and violent supernatural superhero series on Netflix? </TEXT>
