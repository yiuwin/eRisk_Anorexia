	<TITLE> Recapping the time I finished all Gang Attacks </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-10 22:47:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I used [this guy's](http://www.psu.com/forums/showthread.php/318975-GTA-Online-Gang-Attack-Map) most updated map to go around the state and finish all Gang Attacks. On my way, I discovered a few things:


* The Schwartzer is probably the best Drift car in the game. Drifts like the Futo but with way more power upon exiting. The Futo loses revs and is weak coming out of a drift. The Schwartzer maintains high revs.

* The best way to complete a Gang Attack is to use your vehicle for cover and let the bad guys come to you. [Here my Schwartzer after it was used for cover in about 7-8 Gang Attacks.](http://imgur.com/a/ZJvJa) This was right before I took it to Beeker's for repairs and to continue my quest.

* The Gang Attack at number 54 (where the Vagos hang out) is currently broken. It does not appear at any time of day. EDIT: as of 3/7/14 it's working again.

* I had pretty much completed all the Gang Attacks already just in the natural course of playing this game. I was only missing one that's listed on this map: [#52](http://i.imgur.com/XK48tjn.jpg)

* The hardest Gang Attack was the one up at the Nudist Colony Fort. They are extremely aggressive. The residents attack you before the Gang Attack even triggers, and this brings police. Then you have to lose the cops and trigger the Gang Attack and immediately after the Gang Attack - before I even had a chance to collect the crates - the residents respawn and started attacking me again. Then I got stars again. I just said eff it and booked it out of there.

* My ammo was pretty much always replenished enough for the next GA so I never spent money on buying more ammo. I could survive without buying armour so, fiscally speaking, the whole endeavor was net positive. Albeit only by a little.

Because I had taken out several Lost gangsters in a row or in a day or in rapid succession, I got this text message from Al Carter:

If you're looking for fun stuff to do, this is a very challenging and fun way to pass your time. Print out the map, get a marker or pen to check off your completed GAs and explore!

	<TEXT> So 1.17 allows your Pegasus vehicle to be put away when it's not in use for a period of time. 

I was on a mission using the Buzzard and I had to park the Buzzard to return a van to Lester.

While driving far away, I was thinking it was going to be a drag to steal a vehicle to drive all the way back to where the other van is waiting for me (mission: Quarry Quarry.) I would much rather fly using my Buzzard. But I can't call for it because my Buzzard is still in play. 

Suddenly the Pegasus lady notified me that she put the chopper back. 

I was able to call for another and fly back to the objective. That's a helpful feature.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A tale of the time I met Alex Smith </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-02 20:56:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Five years ago, I was asked to film a promo video for a photographer friend of mine. She invited me to join her on an engagement photo shoot and film how she styles and photographs the couple.

Being good friends, I agreed and tagged along. What she didn't tell me until the morning of the shoot was that the groom in question was Alex Smith. Alex was rehabbing from shoulder surgery at the time.

Alex and his fiance, Elizabeth, were both really down to earth and kind. Not unlike any other engaged couple I encounter routinely, in my line of work. My photographer friend, went on to shoot Alex and Elizabeth's wedding.

I didn't 'talk shop' too much with Alex as he had a cold that day and I wasn't sure about how secure he felt about his starting job at the time. So I didn't want to bring up anything that might rub him the wrong way. But the Cardinals were getting ready to play the Steelers in the Super Bowl XLIII so I couldn't resist asking him who he thought would win and who he was rooting for.

"Are you rooting for the Cards or the Steelers? Is it like a NFC thing or do you feel like, if it can't be you guys then you root against them?"

"I want the Cardinals to win," he said.

"Why? Is it a NFC thing?"

"Nah. Because Roethlisberger is a dick."

I LOL.

He went on to explain that on-camera, Big Ben is perfect and gives the perfect answers to the media, etc. But on the field and away from cameras, he's a dick. Pretty much, Alex called him out as a phony.

And because I spent a day with Alex Smith and he was a totally cool guy, I will always be an Alex Smith fan.

	<TITLE> how to stay positive about last week's loss </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-25 00:30:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Of the fifteen quarterbacks that threw at least one interceptions last week, NINE of them lost the game.

Of those nine, FIVE lost by a margin that could have been a result of one less possession (lost 8 or fewer points.)

This demonstrates what we all already know; if you turn it over, you will probably lose.

Of the other fifteen quarterbacks who did not throw an interception, only five lost their games.

And of those five, Kaepernick, had the second-highest QB rating (103.3)

So he played pretty great and it was dumb penalties that lost the game for us. Moving forward, I fully expect the Niners to bounce back against a traveling, emotionally weary Eagles team who are probably overconfident and not ready for a desperate 49ers. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Old, slow, infinite money glitch... Still works </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-06 09:57:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is an old glitch that has never been patched and is still working. It's so old (and doesn't make much money) that no one really uses it. 

But I think it's worth documenting. 

 start a contact mission where the cops don't come after you (most missions where you DON'T have to "lose the cops" as one of the steps, will work.)

 go to a convenience store (the ones with two cash registers work better because it's worth more money)

 shoot the registers until the sparks fly and money drops out. 

 grab the money then run out of the store. 

 run across the street or to the middle of the street and circle back until you can audibly hear the cash register "sparks" sound again. 

 then run back inside to find that more cash has fallen out of the register. 

 you can do this repeatedly for infinite money. 

You can make as much as $100-$200 every 6-10 seconds. That translates to about $1200/minute or $72,000/hour

That's not much, but it's SOMEthing. 

I often do this just now because after 1.16, missions are worth more if you take longer than 10-minutes to complete them. So I do this to kill time. 

(NOTE: this will not work with Ammunation because the doors will lock if you go out of the store after shooting it up.) </TEXT>

The five of us successfully guarded it from anywhere from three to eight or so other players for something like 15-20 minutes until I lagged out. Not sure what happened next. Haven't talked to the other guys yet. 

But it was a blast! It's worth a try if you can do manage it.

	<TITLE> You don't need to do the SP-MP glitch to do the hooker dupe glitch. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-18 10:02:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> EDIT: so I've tried this again and could not replicate. Sorry, guys. Seems like it was a fluke. 

So here's what happened (PS3):

 I did NOT do the sp-mp glitch where you load sp and then online, etc to get the sp car to spawn in an online session. 

 I was playing some missions in a normal public lobby. (First rooftop rumble, then a user created race, then a Rockstar created air-race.) 

 I quit midway through the air race and spawned on the ground with my modified Vapid Blade. (Hipster dlc car) That was the car I had with me before I started the missions. 

 I noticed it was 00:12 on the clock (12am, that is...) and for those of us who have waited all in-game-day for the hookers to show up, we know how precious "the hooker-hours" are.

 so, just on a whim, I drove down to the beach to pick up a hooker to try the glitch. Found one, honked, she got in. 

 I drove to my Weasel Tower home. I drove I between the bench and short pillars to wedge the doors shut to make sure the hooker couldn't escape. Fired my ap pistol to scare her, jumped out, killed her, jumped back in, drove into my garage. 

 then I stepped out of my car, ordered an elegy and went to the vehicle arrangement blue circle to swap the new Elegy spot (still empty) and the Blade. 

 sure enough, they switched and the Blade was duped. 

 got back into hooker car, drove out, then back in. 

 ordered another elegy. 

 did the swap with the vehicle arrangement blue circle again. 

 before it appeared, went out on foot and stole a car to drive to the LSC. 

 called the mechanic to deliver the Blade. Sold it for $200,000+

 messed around until I could call the mechanic again. Called him and then sold the other Blade for $200,000+ again. (I believe this one was the original Blade.)

 my second dupe did not work. It was still an elegy. I think I didn't wait long enough and then I left the garage before it was delivered as a dupe. This might have been the problem. 

But the bottom line is that I did manage to get the hooker glitch to work even though I didn't "bypass the hotfix" by doing the sp-mp first. 

Can anyone else try it and confirm?

	<TEXT> The Laser Fighter Jet is now the king of GTAO.

* The minigun doesn't have the range or enough vertical latitude to be effective.

* The RPG is pointless unless you get REALLY lucky

* I cannot shoot it down with a heavy sniper without dying a bunch of times first.

* If the jet DOES start to smoke and takes enough damage, the pilot flies up to Zancudo to get another.

* I cannot out drive it.

* I cannot go off radar long enough to do anything strategic

* I cannot go get my own jet because he will blow me up before I take off and I spawn outside again.

So far, I can only go passive and/or hide, but that shit is for cowards. I want to FIGHT BACK.

Help me brainstorm about what I can do. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need Suggestions for Road Trip "Movie Games" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-01 23:51:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We will be going on some roadtrips soon and would love some suggestions for games we can play meanwhile.

These are the two types that we play. Any interesting variations or completely new games are welcomed. Please be clear on the rules, etc.

**Six Degrees**

(Two or more players required. No maximum.)

* Player one comes up with the name of an actor or actress but keeps it in his head.

* Player two does the same.

* On the count of three, both players call out the actor or actress they thought of.

* Now, all players begin to think of links between the two actors in six-degrees or less. The first person to answer wins. 

* the 'links' will go something like this. Try to connect Bruce Willis to Adam Sandler: (1) Bruce Willis was in Fifth Element with Chris Tucker. (2) Chris Tucker was in Rush Hour with Jackie Chan. (3) Jackie Chan was in Canonball Run with Burt Reynolds. (4) Burt Reynolds was in The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler.


**"The Movie Game"**

(Two or more players. Even number of players might require special consideration, see below.)

* Player one comes up with an actor or actress.

* Player two must come up with a movie in which that actor or actress was cast.

* Player three comes up with an actor or actress that was in the movie named by player two.

* Continue the pattern.

* If you lose three times, you are out.

* A player who is stuck can 'challenge' the previous player. That previous player must be able to come up with an answer that the challenger could have said. If not, the player who got challenged loses. (for example, Player One says "Malcolm McDowell", player two says "Cat People" and player three can't think of another actor who was in Cat People. Player Three then challenges player two. Player Two can't remember another actor or actress in Cat People, so Player Two loses. (A correct answer would have been Natassja Kinski.)

* In a situation where there are an even number of players, the same players will keep on having to come up with an actor or a movie, turn after turn. In this case, after each round, you can alternate the roles.

Do any of you have some good alternatives or variations to these games?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I was playing normally in an online session and I got an invite to someone's apartment. I usually just ignore these invites, but since I wasn't doing anything important, I thought I'd accept.

I end up in a six-car apartment near Vespucci (by the canals.)

There are about six people already in the room. I walk over to get some beer on the kitchen counter and my character lags for a second. The next thing I realize is that the owner of the apartment ejected everyone from the apartment (as you can as of 1.13)

But his friend is waiting outside and he shotguns everyone for an instant 5-0 K/D increase.

All hell breaks loose as we respawn and, unsure of who is friend or foe, everyone starts killing everyone. 

I managed to survive after killing a couple of people and then I head over to the police station nearby, stealing the armored truck, and heading down to the pier where Pegasus left a tank for me. I almost never call in tanks unless there's already a tank in play. It's too cheap.

But for this, I was willing to make an exception.

The owner of the apartment chased me to the pier but I managed to get into the tank before he could intercept me. 

Needless to say, I spawn killed him about five times before starting a mission and leaving the lobby.

Be wary of apartment invites now that there is a way to kick everyone out all at once. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A little bit of background. Ive always been conservative. But the first time I registered to vote, I registered independent. I've never liked big government -- even when it was a Republican government. I felt like I had to defend Bush because he wasn't the alternative, but I found myself having a difficult time doing so. (That is, I didn't have a problem retorting to liberals and their criticism, but I had a hard time with justifying some of the policies when I argued with them internally.)

Soon, I reasoned that it wasn't liberalism that was the only issue, it was also too much government.

I'm familiar with Friedman economics in principle and am learning more about libertarianism each day I visit this sub. 

But I have a few questions. (I'm sorry the questions cover multiple topics and might be difficult to answer all at once.) but I only need to be pointed in the right direction as I'm capable and willing to do the follow-up research on my own. Thanks in advance. 

 In a free market system where government plays only a tiny role, where does consumer protection happen? I realize that on a small scale, superior products will best inferior products, but in our current world of mega-markets and super conglomerate corporations, if a company wants to create bad products or unhealthful products for public consumption, where does consumer protection happen? No other smaller companies can outmaneuver the giants so aren't consumers stuck with the bad product?

 where do libertarians fall on the issue of wars waged in the interest of national security? I realize there's a industrial military complex that has ulterior motives for every and any military operation, so finding a just war fought STRICTLY for national security might be difficult. But in conflicts where the consensus is a preemptive attack is better in the long run, where to libertarians generally align themselves?

 in a libertarian world where a small government exists and the markets are free, would an undocumented immigrant workforce actually aid the economy? 

 in the simplest terms, what are the essential responsibilities of a federal government? If you have some resources, that would suffice. 

Thanks, everyone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've literally been a white dot for about 15 minutes since 1.13 came out. I play everyday for long periods of time and significant chunks of that have been spent SPECIFICALLY avoiding killing people to try to get the red dot white again. 

And it never works. 

But suddenly, once in a blue moon, I log on and I'm white. (Then instantly red again... Because... Well because gta.) this has happened three times (one of which was when I logged on as my second character and came back to first character. Could not replicate.)

There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for the attaining white dot. What's the formula?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> CMV: I believe that Steve Austin, the six million dollar man, was grotesquely unbelievable as a piece of science fiction. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-23 02:02:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As a child, I watched The Six-Million Dollar Man with great enthusiasm and regularity. But even then -- as an 8-year old watching it in syndication -- I was acutely aware of the impossibilities that our suspension of disbelief was supposed to afford us. 

 six million dollars is strangely arbitrary number that means nothing. If it's referring to the amount of material goods, ie hardware, that Steve Austin was toting around, it's a really high price tag. Adjusted for inflation, $6M in 1974 (the air date of season one) is equal to about $29M in 2014. Based in what we see of the materials used, there's no way it totaled $29,000,000 of goods. If they're referring to the budget for the entire bionics program, it's an incredibly low price tag. So "$6M man" is just a dumb name that's indicated and referred to nothing.

 his super strength must be limited to what his biological body parts can sustain. Suppose he lifts a 2000 lb car from the front bumper. His legs might be able to carry the weight, but his pelvis, spine, and core muscles, along with his right shoulder, pectorals and deltoid muscles would all have to be able to as well. Realistically he would collapse under the weight. Furthermore, in order to run at the speeds he was able to run, his pelvic muscles, back muscles would all have to move at speeds human biology would prohibit. His left arm would, in reality, lag behind his right arm as he swings his arms while running.

 his bionic optics would not have better fidelity, responsiveness, and dynamic range than his biological optics. We're nearly forty years removed from that technology and only now are we developing optics that can rival that of the human eye. Sensors and lenses that can see what Steve Austin could see had to be at least the size of his head. And if you say that technology was secret and highly developed military/government issued stuff, then why not make a camera or telescope based in that same technology? The series never showcased any such tech. 

About the only thing still awesome about that show is the opening credit monologue and theme song. CMV  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Contains spoilers for The Last of Us]

I believe that Joel, in lying about Ellie's surgery and saving her from the lobotomy -- in spite of possibly robbing the world of an antidote or cure for the plague -- Joel did the right thing. 

In classic thought-experiments, it is often acceptable to sacrifice one life for the lives of many, depending on the specific experiment. But when it comes to actively killing one life in exchange for many, it's usually considered unacceptable. Murder is always wrong. 

Further, based on the voice recorders that Joel found throughout the hospital, it didn't seem like Ellie's surgery would result in a sure-fire cure anyway. So gambling with a person'a life without even guaranteeing the safety of others, is even less desirable. 

Lastly, Joel's love for Ellie by the end of the story equaled his love for Sarah, effectively making Ellie his daughter. I believe a father's first priority in that situation, is the well-being of his daughter. Quite possibly, in that apocalyptic world, even above the lives of all mankind.

	<TEXT> I go to get my car out of the impound, and for kicks, I decide to pay the $200 fee to open the gates instead of stealing my car back in exchange for stars. 

I press the dpad when prompted and it tells me I don't have enough money. I have over $3 million in the bank but none in my wallet. 

Ok, I guess the police in LS don't talk credit cards, only cash. Fair enough. 

So I take out $500 and try again. 

The gate opens and let's me in. 

But I check my balance and they took the $200 out of my bank instead of my wallet, which still shows $500. 

Rockstar should just remove the wallet mechanic altogether, and leave it like singleplayer. They should just abandon the drop-money-when-killed affectation.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> CMV :: I believe physically demanding jobs should not have gender-specific standards in their physical fitness testing. Change my view... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-09 02:19:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> EDIT: (original query below) A lot of people are saying that physical fitness tests are simply in place to see if you're physically fit. They're not in place to test your ability to execute specific tasks. 

This seems like a plausible answer. 

The problem then remains, are these gender-specific physical fitness test obsolete or irrelevant since it's being argued that they have little or no bearing on in-the-field tasks? 

EDIT2: it seems there are no good reasons to have these men-and-women physical fitness tests. at least no one has been able to successfully argue in favor of them. It seems that either the tests expect less of the female participants or, if they tests are not intended to indicate the ability to execute in-the-field activities, they seem obsolete anyway.

So I'm not convinced that these need to exist.

Original query below 



__________


I saw a documentary about becoming a firefighter and a separate documentary about the Army's basic training. 

They both highlighted a difference in physical fitness standards. 

Women were not required to demonstrate the ability to do pull ups and sit ups as the men were. In all cases, they had to do fewer. 

([Here are some sample standards for army physical fitness testing](http://www.physicallytrained.com/14-4-test-administration/))

I believe that, in combat or in fighting fires, etc, the standard for physical fitness should not change because of gender. If you need to lift multiple 40lbs tank shells and repeatedly load them into the turret, it doesn't matter if you're a woman or a man. You have to be able to physically do it. If you have a smoke-inhalation victim who weighs 160lbs, and you have to carry him out of an apartment, your strength and ability to save that person is a fixed standard.

Driving around the city, I figured this location was too eccentric to be just made up and must be based on something in real life. A quick Google search for "Hollywood Storage Under Freeway" turned this up. 


I searched "hollywood" simply because in the game it's called "vinewood" storage. Not brain surgery.

If you used a Buzzard it made it pretty painless to destroy all the garbage trucks and you can take out all the rival crew without every getting out of the chopper. 

It was worth $18000, IIRC. 

But I think Rockstar just nerfed it because I played it and at the end, when you're supposed to "take out the crew boss" because he's "fleeing" A) he was in a car instead of on foot. And B) when I blew him up, I failed the mission. 

Wtf

anyone else experience this yet? </TEXT>

My question is, beyond the obvious answer of "just start another show," what do you guys do when your show seasons ends? Rewatch? Take a break? Play games? Do something else entirely? What? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I accepted the challenge to test the Sentinel and the Sentinel XS.

**TLDR - The Sentinel XS is hands-down faster than the Sentinel.**

[Photo of the two brothers](http://i.imgur.com/XdaQBMA.jpg)

[Another angle.](http://i.imgur.com/mxt8T9X.jpg)

_________________________________

[Last week, I posted some unscientific, pragmatic data](http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/25qe5y/the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king/) about the new High Life DLC sports cars (I mean 'sports cars' in the generic sense, not the categorical sense,) the Massacro and the Zentorno. I pitted the newcomers against the perennial champions and found that old king Elegy held on to its title while the outrageously brash Zentorno dethroned the Entity in the Sports and Super categories, respectively.

In the comments, /u/The_Bone_Machine/ [asked if I could](http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/25qe5y/the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king/chjw0jv) test and post results for the Ubermacht Sentinel versus its sportier brother, the Sentinel XS. I said that I would post the results I already recorded because I had done that exact test a few months ago. Shortly thereafter, I was made aware of [this stat sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AlUQhOXwk9_ndDNQX3dfbC1KTjAtY2J3QVN6QVFCVlE type=view gid=0 f=true colid0=1 filterstr0=SENTINEL sortcolid=-1 sortasc=true rowsperpage=250) that showed -- at least the stock version of these cars -- are programmatically identical and therefore I should save my time. /u/killzy707/ was cool enough to show me the link.

/u/Laust17/ said my claim that the cars are not the same is "bullshit."

This information was counter to what my findings showed and a minor back and forth ensued about the merits of these stats and the pragmatic results of in-game, on-the-street, modified vehicle results would be.

But between the concrete evidence of the stat sheet and /u/killzy707/ saying he has tested both in a drag race and that they have ["exactly the same performance"](http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/25qe5y/the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king/chkv1sx), I was ready to be convinced. [I said as much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/25qe5y/the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king/chkvb30)

Nevertheless, I began my hunt for another Sentinel (I have an XS in my second garage, but no Sentinel) in order to put this discussion to rest. Last night, I found one. I immediately modified it and then began tests.

I did three tests to make the results as indisputable and conclusive as possible. ***I did not test the cars stock. If I had, perhaps the findings would support the stat sheet.***

_________________________________

***Test One*** *Straight Line* | I used a self-made race called [Business Weekend RP Grab](http://rsg.ms/1ghYbn4) (see below) in order to test a simple straight-line drag race. While the race was purposely designed to be the minimum acceptable length for a race (because it was supposed to be used to farm RB) and it's a *little* too short for either Sentinels to reach top speed, it's still a good test for acceleration. (I didn't see a point in doing this more than just once.)

[Results:](http://i.imgur.com/BSlZzfU.jpg)

Sentinel 27:582

Sentinel XS 26:230 **(winner)**

_________________________________

***Test Two*** *Lap* | I used Criminal Records. Remember when the game first came out and all we ever did was grind Criminal Records and Down the Drain? good times. (not really.) I did three lap races, three times each.

Results:

[Sentinel](http://i.imgur.com/qq58Y6i.jpg)

Race 1 | 1:21:410 total | 25:308 best

Race 2 | 1:21:054 total | 25:135 best

Race 3 | 1:21:973 total | 25:321 best

Total Average | 1:21:479

Best Average | 25:255


[Sentinel XS](http://i.imgur.com/HGXv0Lj.jpg) **(winner)**

Race 1 | 1:19:351 total | 24:452 best

Race 2 | 1:19:940 total | 24:920 best

Race 3 | 1:19:592 total | 24:649 best

Total Average | 1:19:627

Best Average | 24.674

__________________________________

***Test Three*** *Road Course* | I used Cutting Coroners and did four races of three laps each.

Results:

Sentinel

Race 1 | 3:34:304 total | 1:09:402 best

Race 2 | 3:35:602 total | 1:09:844 best

Race 3 | 3:28:608 total | 1:07:262 best

Race 4 | 3:31:030 total | 1:08:438 best

Total Average | 3:32.386

Best Average | 1:08.737

Sentinel XS **(winner)**

Race 1 | 3:23:558 total | 1:04:870 best

Race 2 | 3:24:198 total | 1:06:738 best

Race 3 | 3:24:011 total | 1:05:047 best

Race 4 | 3:20:716 total | 1:04:770 best

Total Average | 3:23.121

Best Average | 65.356

_________________________________

**Conclusion: The Sentinel XS is by far and away the faster of the two cars** (when they're both fully modded.)

If you think I did any part of this test incorrectly or if you think there is other data that refutes my findings, I would love to hear it.

Many people still love the convertible Sentinel Better than the XS because it spawns in traffic much less frequently, adding to its appeal as a rare car. Also, it has that sexy, seamless, folding hardtop that you only get in expensive 'hot' cars like the cognoscenti Cabrio.

For me, I like the additional mods of the XS, especially the bad ass roll cage and front lip. And add to that, the better performance.

Anyway, I've always dreamed of owning an M3, so until then, the Sentinel XS is my favorite of the two Sentinels.


_________________________________

A few full disclosure notes:

* **Modifying the two Sentinels** -- I did maximum performance modifications. That is, Turbo, Engine, Transmission, and Suspension. I left the tires in the stock class (sports) but I changed the wheels to a custom wheel based on aesthetic. They both have max armor, and bullet proof tires. The exhaust was not necessarily max, but one that I liked aesthetically. The spoiler on the Sentinel was not max, but the one before max (the high level spoiler, I believe it's called.) The XS has the max carbon wing.

* **Business Weekend RP Grab race** -- [This was a race](http://rsg.ms/1ghYbn4) that I created during the Double RP Business Weekend. It maximized RP and minimized the time to finish and was a very successful RP farm when played in a playlist. (It has since been nerfed; it went from ~3000+ RP per race down to 300 RP.) It is *almost* a straight line. There's a slight curve to it at the beginning, but once you hit the first gradual apex, you can go straight without touching the steering. In both tests, I still touched the steering *ever* so slightly to improve my line to the finish. In order to keep the launch as fair as possible, I did not use the turbo launch. I simply floored it during the countdown and let the car peel out on its own.

* **Criminal Records** -- I was initially going to do a ten-lap race to minimize variances and anomalies in laps. But at my first attempt, one the fifth lap, I glanced a telephone pole and messed myself up. So instead of risking the huge waste of time a 9th-lap-crash would be, I decided to do multiple shorter races instead. SO I did three laps, three times, each.

* **Cutting Coroners** -- This test was done months ago and I had the stats recorded but I didn't report them because I did it for my own edification. But I'm putting the data up now since it's become relevant. Back when I did it, I didn't do the ten laps I do nowadays. I did four three-lap races for my data pool. It is possible the cars had different stats during that build. I believe this test was conducted back at v1.11. But unlike the guns in the COD games, the cars in GTAV don't get nerfed and buffed for gameplay balance. At least not as far as we're generally aware.

	<TEXT> So, as I've done in the past ([Ocelot v Ocelot](http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/1wxm19/ocelot_jackal_vs_ocelot_f620_time_trials/), [Buffalo II v Sultan](http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/1wlok4/sultan_rs_v_buffalo_ii_time_trials/), and others,) I took a couple of the new cars out for an unscientific time-trial test drive.

The Elegy RH8 is the reigning champ in the Sports category, and the Entity XF is the reigning champ in the Super category. No cars have come close to touching these two beasts. But wait... with the new vehicles, maybe someone can finally challenge these two kings.

Here are quick results:

10 laps around Cutting Coroners:

**Sports**

* Elegy RH8 | 10:03:935 total | 58:454 fastest | 60.393 average

* Massacro | 10:14:666 total | 59:093 fastest | 61.466 average

**Super**

* Entity XF | 9:58:147 total | 57:158 fastest | 59.815 average

* Zentorno | 9:55:862 total | 57:789 fastest | 59.586 average

_____________________________________

**Conclusion**: The Elegy is still king. But the Entity, despite it's vice-like brakes and all-wheel-drive, can't match the raw power of the Zentorno. I feel like the Zentorno is a little tougher to keep full traction and not drift, but it has so much power that it saves you in many a sticky, lift-induced-oversteer situation. If you notice the Zentorno's fastest lap isn't as fast as the Entity's, it's because I was still learning how to drive it. But there's no doubt that if I go back and retest it, it would utterly smoke the Entity. Possibly by a whole second.

X-Files comes to mind. Star Trek.

But is it even possible to make a feature film from series like Breaking Bad, True Detective, Walking Dead, the Sopranos, or even lighter stuff like Entourage, Nurse Jackie or whatever? Do you think the medium precludes the possibility of this jump? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've asked this before, but there is some new information in this newswire

And the new Mental State player stat shows you just how passive or psychotically unhinged fellow players in your session really are  so you'll know if you need to have it at the ready when they approach. 

it seems you should be able to see their 'mental state' as they approach. so will this be reflected in the minimap? Or will you have to go to the player roster to see a color code or something? 

What do you guys think? </TEXT>

This axe would be cool as a double-handed melee weapon: http://i.imgur.com/lSrikDv.jpg


The way I got inside was to drive in quickly and immediately hit triangle / Y to exit the car. 

The car stayed inside, the garage door stayed open, but the guy didn't accept the vehicle yet. So everything just stayed accessible. 

By the way, there's no character in the garage. Just a disembodied voice that says he likes the car (or not.) </TEXT>
