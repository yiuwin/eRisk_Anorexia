This is a Canadian film that I personally helped out with when they were shooting in my town. I got a hold of the script and it was the worst thing I've ever read. It's about a vampire dog from Transylvania who instead of blood, eats red jelly. When he's given to his previous owners child grandson, madness ensues. 

Come on Norm, you deserve better. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I think HBO should remake Misfits... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-02 04:27:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know almost every American remake of a British show is much worse than the original, I feel like this could really work. Firstly, a big problem I've noticed with shows like Skins and The Inbetweeners is that when they get remade, they completely lose the realism that they had. This is simply due to the much stricter television standards in America. This would not be the case with HBO though, so they could capture the raw feeling from Misfits. I also think they could fix a lot of the problems the series faced from Season 3 onwards. HBO isn't making Utopia anymore, might as well try and make Misfits and do it justice. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After rewatching Funny People, I realized that this was a pivotal moment in Adam Sandler's career. His films up to this point were slowly going downhill in terms of reviews and popularity. Funny People is also highly reflective of Sandler's own career. It seemed like this was his way of saying "Hey, I know I've made some shit lately, but it's time for some sort of change." All though Funny People wasn't perfect, it's still much better than a lot of Sandler's prior work. But what came next was so much worse....

I feel like somewhere out there is a universe where Sandler did the reverse of what really happened. He follows up Funny People with amazing movie after another. Ends up being the next Bill Murray in terms of acclaim and popularity. I wish that was the world we lived in sometimes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [FEATURE] My Summer With Cancer </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is the story of my own personal experience with testicular cancer at the age of 17. It's a more comedic and honest take on what I went through, which was nothing similar to the big "cancer" movie when I got diagnosed (The Fault in Our Stars). It's currently a work in progress, but I would love some feedback on what I have so far in order to help me keep working on it. The entirety of my story involves the many hurdles I went through dealing with the medical system as a teenager, as well as the social implications of having cancer and going through chemotherapy while being in your senior year of high school. Please let me know any comments you may have, anything is appreciated.

	<DATE> 2014-11-03 07:15:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  So I did an ama after I got diagnosed, so I figured I'd do one now that I have completed the long difficult journey of chemotherapy! I was diagnosed with testicular cancer late June last year, and had to have the testicle removed. After that, due to the kind of tumor I had, I had to undergo four rounds of chemotherapy which was everyday for 6 hours for 5 days straight, per round. I'm really doing this to try and help anyone who might be in a similar situation, or just make others more knowledgeable about what it's really like to live through cancer as well as chemo. So go ahead ask away, I'm not shy. I will literally answer anything, don't be afraid. 

EDIT: This made the front page, thanks to everyone! I always knew cancer would be my ticket to the front page. On a side note, my ultimate goal right now is to create a screenplay based on my experiences. So if anyone has any questions or tips about that, it would be greatly appreciated! I'm aspiring writer/director so I'd love some help

PROOF: FYI, this scar is on my waist, not my balls. Didn't think I'd have to make that clear but yeah. these are the pictures I used for my last ama as proof (hence the incorrect dates), too lazy too take more pictures of my surgery scar. http://imgur.com/5Xyzatn.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> About a month ago I started noticing pain in one of my testicles, so I saw a doctor after a couple of days. Everyone including the doctor said it was most likely something common, and it would be a simple fix. Three days later after I got some tests done, he told me it was a tumor and diagnosed with me testicular cancer. Two weeks ago I went in for surgery and had to get the testicle with the tumor on it removed. Lots of people in school and such don't really understand anything about the whole situation, so I figured I'd give people any information they want on the whole thing!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Well last night I was out with a bunch of friends. Two of us (this includes me) were high out of our minds (about a [8]), one of our other friends was quite high (I'd say a [5]) and then everyone else was sober. So we all decide to go to an abandoned slaughterhouse outside of town, and then venture inside. As we are driving there, my friend (sober, dont worry) hits a patch of snow and ends up driving into the ditch. So after being stuck in this -20 weather for a good half hour, eventually another pickup truck drives by and helps. All in all, it was just some terrible luck to begin with, but at least we got out safe and sound in the end. This allowed us to go back to my friends place and smoke another bowl! :D </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just thought I would share my first experience ever trying marijuana. So, first a bit of backstory. Ever since I knew what weed was, I always supported legalization. I even wrote a report about legalizing it in the 7th grade. This is mainly due to my brother previously being a dealer and having been charged with intent to sell. Anyways, I always was open to trying it, but never wanted to push it on myself just out of fear of trying a new substance, and smoking something in general. Last year though (Grade 9), I was at a party in a park that a bunch of my friends were at. I went due to a girl I was interested in inviting me. So we were all drinking and what not, when someone busts out a pipe and start passing it around. So none of my friends smoke weed, excluding my one friend who used to, but didnt regularly at the time. Anyways, I'm questioning whether I should, when one of my female friends takes some. At that point I said, "Well if ... is trying it, I guess I have to!". All of my friends excluding one ended up trying it. It was a great night, and got me started on one of my favorite habits ever. I still smoke on weekends now, and am also on the Honor Roll, in advanced math classes, and on the high school basketball team a year later. Just goes to show how marijuana really doesn't have a negative affect on your life! Thanks for listening, anyone else have good first time stories??? Share them in the comments!

TL;DR Have always supported legalization, but did not try smoking until it began being passed at a party and one of my friends unexpectedly tried it. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-08-05 02:50:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So recently I was playing Saints Row The Third when I had a sudden dark realization. I was calmly shooting random civilians with a rocket launcher when I thought, how would it feel to just be walking down the street and then be shot dead in cold blood by a stranger? This got me thinking even more about something. There are no children of any kind in this world. Not one. Not even a teenager or anything less than and adult. So you know what that means? Every bloodline ends with these people that are walking the streets. Yet what am I doing currently? I'm killing them. I'm killing the last remaining people alive on earth. This means that in Saints Row, every time you kill someone you are successfully coming closer to making the population extinct. But you're character can revive himself. You're characters plan is to become the last surviving human, and in the game that's what you are doing. You are destroying the entire human race single handedly. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-07-19 09:52:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am 15 years old. Let me just say that before I begin. Throughout my short amount of years I have realized a little something. That something is that very rarely will adults ever acknowledge what you say with the same amount of respect as if you had more time spent on this earth. Now, I can understand that logic to some degree, as they have spent more time alive and experienced more and therefore should have a more logical insight on certain topics. But the key word there is CERTAIN. For example, my dad and I may be having a disagreement on a topic that I definitely know more about, as it is relavent to my life and not his, yet he will still state that he is right sheerly based on the fact that I do not know what I am talking about based on my age and experiences. I know damn well what I am talking about and if you would listen, I'm sure I could convince you of that. Maybe this is just me though. So that's why I'm asking, if you are an adult, why do you so often dismiss comments and opinions from people of a younger age? And if you are not an adult yet, what is a time where you have been in a situation like this?

EDIT: It came to my attention that I did not provide an example, which I guess is required in this situation. So one example was when I tried to explain to him that in Major League Baseball they rub a certain type of mud on all of the balls prior to the playing. He said I was wrong because he knows baseball and I do not know as much as him. So I had to show him three websites all backing up my statement until he believed me. That's just one example though. (yes I just copied this from a comment I made to someone asking for an example) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should spanking still be universally accepted as a punishment for children? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-07-19 09:30:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Recently I was working at a small gun club outside my city over the weekend. It was a very easy job, as there were many breaks. On my breaks I was allowed to sit inside the club house and relax, as did the shooters. But there was one couple who brought their child there (I'd say around 3 years old). This child was not the best behaved, but not the worst. There were a few times where he would begin doing something wrong, and his parents would solve it by saying "Do you want spanks?!" and he would stop. One time though, he was caught doing something wrong (nothing too bad, I believe it was just for not being calm enough) so his father took him into the bathroom. As I sat on the couch reading, I could hear the sounds of a child crying out in pain as his father spanked him fairly severely. They then eventually came out of the bathroom, as the child still had tears in his eyes. Personally I think spanking is a very primitive form of punishment and also a form of child abuse. Do you think that spanking should still be accepted, or should it more or less become phased out from parenting? </TEXT>
