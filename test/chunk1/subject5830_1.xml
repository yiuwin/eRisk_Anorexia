	<TITLE> Fostex T40rp/T50rp Mk3. Volume check to see if your cable was bad like mine. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-23 12:28:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the Fostex T40rp/T50rp Mk3? My brother first spotted it when he was comparing his HD600's to my T40rp with "The Revenant Main Theme" by Ryuichi Sakamoto on Spotify.

If you have a pair of T40rp/T50rp please try them with this song and give them a good crank of volume and see if you get the "crackle" too. Right away at the very beginning of the song when the bass rumbles the headphones were giving off a horrible crackling sound and I thought it was the actual headphones at first until I tried the T40rp cable to connect my Mobile phone's aux to my car stereo and noticed the sounds wasn't great with that either. That's when I realised it was the cable and not the cans. 

So I changed the cable to a spare aux I had lying around, put The Revenant Main Theme on again at the same volume and wow, they sound was gone. No more crackle.
I never noticed it on 99% of songs at a lower volume anyway but I'd rather know I can crank the headphones without worry of the "crackling" with too much bass.

**Edit: The cable I'm talking about is that weird "bouncy" orange one** </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-09-21 12:38:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've made a couple of posts about this now but I'm just narrowing down my options as there's much to take in.

I'm looking at getting one of these guns to mod with silencers and maybe a scope without the price being too much overall. Is it worth getting the 2250 as it has a longer barrel and a scope already? I heard the longer barrel of the 2250 would make it quieter than the shorter 2240 barrel or am I best just getting the 2240 and modding it?

My main goal is for accurate back garden plinking.

	<TEXT> I am looking for a gun for back garden plinking and my Sig P226 creates way too much noise (also inaccurate) and I know it will eventually get my neighbours poking their noses from their windows to see what I'm up to and I'd rather not attract too much attention.

There are two cheaper guns I'm looking at but would both would need silencers. They are the Crosman 2240 and 2250. How does the 2250 vary over accuracy of the 2240 and do they both sound the same with silencers?

If you know of another accurate and quiet CO2 plinking gun for firing 10-15 yards let me know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've just decided to pick a Sig Sauer P226 as I've wanted to get into air guns. Lovely gun, love the look and feel of it but it shoots worse than an 80 [Colt Python.357 .177](http://i.imgur.com/apNhM22.jpg) at about 10 yards.

I've tried about 50 shots with both and the P226 is missing a lot of the shots. The Colt hit the majority with decent grouping.

Does anyone else have the P226? How has it been for you? I'm seriously considering selling mine and getting something else cheaper...

	<TEXT> Has anyone tested themselves how long the battery for the N3DS XL lasts with the 3D on compared to the 3D off?

I normally play with the 3D off as a lot of the time I personally don't find most games comfortable to play with it on but then there are games like Zelda: ALBW which look great in 3D. My problem is that I don't want the battery to run out faster if I'm using 3D all the time.

Am I worrying about a little battery loss or is the drain negligible?

	<TEXT> I have a N3DS XL and I love it but I was just wondering how the N3DS feels/plays compared to it. How does the screen difference affect it? I never use the 3D function so I don't mind if it looks better on the N3DS XL

I'm male and I think I have "medium"? sized hands. I'm 5'7 so my hands are not the smallest and are wider than most girls hands so I don't think the N3DS will be too small.

I love the N3DS XL but think that extra bit of portability would be nice as I bring mine to work most days. </TEXT>

Yesterday I decided I would try Fostex again for my work headphones so I bought a pair of T40rp Mk3 as they're closed and would be great for being in an office. I've just received them about 10 minutes ago and [this is how they look](https://i.imgur.com/LJKZjxJ.jpg)...

The box is fine. It's like someones smashed them and put them back. I have ordered for a refund and I ordered another pair for tomorrow. If anything is wrong with the next pair I am done with Fostex for life. Its a damn shame too as I personally love the look and sound of them. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is more of a PSA to anyone who was thinking of buying the game or if you already have it and have been putting it off because it seems too unforgiving for new players. Especially if you're a busy person like myself and you're put off by how time consuming it appears to be.

Before I start I just have to say that until last night I was a ***complete noob*** to Monster Hunter and I still have only scratched the surface so this is just my experience so far. I didn't really think much of the game until I properly played it and now I can't stop thinking about it!

This game in my opinion isn't as difficult for new players as I've previously assumed/read online. It can seem like there's so much going on when you start the game but its a just a case of dedicating a few hours to understood the basics and the rest will come with it.

I have only played the game for 3 hours but I have a good grasp of quests and forging/upgrading my weapons and equipment. I've now finished the first five/six 1 star quests and I have a very good (but still basic) understanding of what the game has to offer and I want to get back into even as I'm typing this.

For those of you who feel put off by the lack of story, please don't. It seems like the sort of game that should have a story but it doesn't need one. Smash Brothers doesn't have a story, look how amazing that is! Once you get a feel for the game you can easily jump in for a mission and then jump straight out, it's amazing and *so addictive!*

I hope this helps some people take that leap to start the game or even bring some playes back that were originally put off.

HAPPY HUNTING!!

**TL;DR: If you're on the fence, give Monster Hunter a chance. Especially if you're a busy person like myself and you're put off by how time consuming it appears to be. It can seem overwhelming but after a few hours of getting a hang of the game you can jump in and out of it with ease.** </TEXT>

I'm asking this question because a few night ago we were both having some beers and testing some songs out on Spotify with both pairs and seeing how they compared. Now, they both were holding up very well against each other until we got a bit more tipsy and nostalgic and decided to put on a Spice Girls song, annoyingly I can't remember which one. The song sounded great through the 600's and then I tried my X2's... I've never heard such a contrast in quality before, especially from headphones that usually sound very similar apart from having more bass. The way they sounded in the X2's was horrible! especially for a pop song I thought they would have possibly been better.

This was almost an instant "I want to sell these and get the 600's" because I don't know how bad other songs might be unless I'm comparing the two cans.

Has anyone every had anything similar happen before with headphones you thought were very close in sound? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had the phone about a week and the first couple of days the slow motion was fine, but I've just tried it today and for some reason the video is slow but it looks like its slowing down a standard FPS video so it looks choppy.

I have looked at the settings but can't see anything, is there some way I could have changed something?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Only going to keep this short but I put it on as a "background" movie expecting more of a childish vibe but it was awesome.

I'm never usually a fan of cartoon movies of DC/Marvel; guess I've never given them a chance before but I will now!

The amount of shit going on was incredible. So many characters who I didn't know but didn't care and the story was so cool, I would love to have seen a AAA blockbuster done like this "cartoon".

Anyway if you're a fan of superhero movies I highly suggest Justice League: Flashpoint Paradox. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...and for the reviews it got I thought it was a bad film.

These are just my opinions, I know there is a book too which goes into more detail about things but these are just my thoughts on the film as a stand alone piece.

A few pointers about the movie:

* Oskars god damn snotty nose! It was pissing me off all the time, just wipe it.

* The story was boring and by the end of the film I just felt like I wasted 2 hours.

* I felt like the "carer" for Eli and the way he got blood was actually the most interesting bit about the film..then he died.

* The whole "I'm not a girl" thing with Eli seemed pointless and didn't add anything.

* The awful CGI cat attack scene with the woman who got infected...

* Oskars god damn snotty nose!!!

Nothing about the movie was scary/interesting and the whole "friendship/love story" between Oskar and Eli was just weird.

The only 2 small bits I liked from the movie was when the infected woman wanted to die so she got the nurse to open the blind and burst into flames from the sunlight. The second was when Eli fed off her carer and then he fell from the window and smashed off that box thing at the bottom.

Anyway those are just my thoughts on the movie and I know people really like it but it just didn't work for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the sound of the T50RP and I recently added the HM5 pads but find that although are super comfy, they move the driver too far from your ear and it changes the sound signature.

I have no experience with pads and there are a lot of random ones online. I want something that's nice and soft, goes around my ears but isn't too thick that it creates too much space from my ear to the driver.

The HM5 pads were 16 and I'd rather not pay more than that. </TEXT>

My brother has just received his T50rp today and his pair also have the same problem.

Basically, to give you an idea, whenever I drag any item onto the desktop or into a folder the file takes a long time to appear, almost like it stalls and I have to click on another folder or minimise it and then go back in to make it appear. Same goes for deleting too. This happens with all files from small images to larger zipped files. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> FiiO E10K sometimes makes a VERY loud crackle/buzz noise </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I have a FiiO E10K and so does my brother. Mines perfect but sometimes for no reason when playing a song my brothers FiiO will belt out a deafening crackle/buzz sound and its very loud. He has tried changing USB's and sometimes it goes away and he can listen to music fine for days, even weeks but it can come back randomly and has been a bit more common over the past day.

It happened with his first FiiO E10K and he returned it, only to find that it still happens with the new one. I keep telling him it must be something to do with his PC but when he swaps it out for mine it work fine.

Has anyone ever came across this problem before? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't mean graphic novels either, like actual books I can read on my kindle? I'd love to be able to read ES lore similar to Lord of the Rings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've just came across [this image](https://i.imgur.com/kvqoC1h.jpg) that shows the best paths to follow the Discworld book.

In the image it has 6 "starter novels". Can anyone recommend the best "path" to read from? I don't want to start going down a path only to find out I'm not that keen on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've just finished reading The Road and although I love the theme of the book, I thought the writing was a bit naff and repetitive.

I'm now looking for something fun and interesting with twists and shocks. I'm not too fussy for the genre but I do prefer sci-fi/fantasy.

Looking forward to suggestions but please, no series books. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [SIB] The Elder Scrolls Online Tamriel Unlimited (PS4) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I love Skyrim but was put off by this game before it came out as I know it was going to have a monthly subscription along with having to pay for PSN each month. As far as I'm aware the game is now free to play and only costs about 15 on eBay.

A couple of questions:

1. Is the game 100% free to play after I pay for the physical copy and PSN costs?
1. What is the online community like? is it still active?
1. As an MMO Would I need to heavily rely on other online players to enjoy the game?
1. What are the missions/quests like? Are they typical fetch quests or are they a bit more interesting?

I know this is an MMO so it won't be exactly like the other Elder Scrolls games but as a fan of the series I want to be persuaded that I would still enjoy it.

	<TEXT> I'm visiting my brother this weekend and I wanted to know if there are any good PC online co-op games in 3rd person that we could play together over two computer?

We like LOTR style games so something along those lines would be great but if not any other suggestions will do. Nothing too "childish".

Even if its not a 3rd person game can you suggest something, in case I could be interested but please, no FPS games </TEXT>
