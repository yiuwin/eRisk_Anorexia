	<TEXT> Hi guys, I am currently in my 2nd year of community college, You may have seen me submit a couple of text posts regarding career choices on this subreddit. These past weeks I have been focusing less on careers that I've fancied and more on skills and things that I'm good at that could apply to a potential career. So far, I've noticed my writing skills are way above average considering what people tell me. Almost all of my English teachers/professors, since middle school, have praised me for my writing ability. I also have a pretty good handle on math. I have done the best in my math classes even though I've shown little to no effort in studying for tests. I can also calculate numbers in my head quite easily. I'm at calculus, and i do admit, I am struggling on some principals, but that stems from study habits and paying attention during lectures. Let's say if I do manage to improve in math and still maintain my skill in English, what could be prospective and lucrative career options for me? I've already thought architecture and civil engineering as a possibility, and I do not want to be an English Teacher or Professor. Any suggestions?

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 20M Civil Engineering BS vs Applied Math BS? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-19 19:13:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sup people of reddit, I am facing a crisis where I have only 6 months to decide upon a major. After rigorous thinking I have come to the conclusion that I should either get a BS civil engineering, then perhaps earn a masters degree in architecture to start an architectural/engineering firm as time progresses OR recieve a bs in applied math and then a masters/double major in economics or finance so I could either do become an actuary, an investment banker, or a financial analyst. In your opinion, what would be a more lucrative and efficient path for me? I am above average when it comes to math skills, but at the same time, I do have admiration for buildings and cities. 

Also, my strongest subject of all time is probably English. But what could be a good-paying job if I major in english besides being a professor, considering if there is a situation where both Applied Math or Engineering does not work out? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Apologies in advance for the long post*

Hi guys,

So currently I am at my 3rd year at junior college, I have completed my general education so far and now I am currently stuck at picking a career path. I am basically lost because i have interests and visions of myself in a variety of careers. Now I am close to changing my major TWICE after being dissatisfied with both of them, and I'm hoping that third time is the charm and I will be solid on deciding my third major. First, let me explain them and why I originally chose them, and why i hate them now:

* **Computer Science (emphasis in Software Engineering):** Being a resident in Silicon Valley, I was always surrounded by innovative technology and electronics. I had become very familiar with the anatomy of a computer and became more proficient at using them at the age of 9. During my freshman year at college, I fancied myself working for companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc... with youthful, ambitious, like-minded people. I was originally inspired by my cousin, who's in his mid-thirties and has been an IT director for multiple corporations. I wanted to test myself in software engineering because of my creative mind, and if I were to throw myself into the tech industry, my best bet was that my desire to create would be fulfilled by being a software developer. However, due to many factors (high competition, the idea i could teach myself how to code if i really wanted to instead of going to years of school for it, lack of enthusiasm for computers, etc...) I have dropped the same programming class twice and decided it wasn't my thing last year.

* **Biology**: I changed to this major directly after dropping my journey to become a programmer. All my life, my mom and aunt have been winking at me   even at times nagging me to get into the medical field, be a doctor, a nurse, a nurse informatics specialist, the list goes on. In high school and elementary school, I did relatively well in science. I thought to myself "Why Not?" I went on to change my field of study to microbial biology to eventually make it into med school to either do Radiation Oncology, or Neuroscience to make my family proud. I've been the most ambitious with pursuing this path. I am currently volunteering for patient relations at a hospital and have done my due diligence on plotting the needed steps to get there. However, my emotion towards course work in school is reflecting that even medicine is something I should not do. I am taking a basic zoology and chemistry class, and I'm finding both classes dull. And in order not to waste time by getting myself into more advanced bio classes to only fail them, I am back to square one evaluating a more pleasant career path.

As for right now, I have done EXCESSIVE research into jobs and careers. I've took so many career test compared results and ruled out jobs by analyzing and this is so far my top 3 choices and why:

* **Architecture/Civil Engineering**: This originally was my childhood dream job. I think as far as I could remember from age 7, I had an immeasurable interest in cities, buildings, skyscrapers. I would often draw maps of cities that didn't exist at early as age 7 (I know that's urban and regional planning, but I was inspired doing that by imagining skylines and buildings). I would also draw buildings and blueprints very often. Shit, my favorite game of all time was SimCity 4, and I was doing whatever it took to get my hands on the AutoCAD extension to create my own buildings and see them in the game. Unfortunately, as I approached my high school years, my mother discouraged me in trying to be anywhere near or in this field, assuring that I would never get a job in that field. It wasn't until recently where I met a family friend who is an architect with 20+ years experience and Vice President of Design for a Hotel Resort. He motivated me to try to work at it and not listen to my parents, saying that it is very rewarding in the future. So I told him my plan was to get a BS in civil engineering and Masters degree in architecture. He told me that definitely would make me first in line to get a successful job in the industry.

* **Actuarial Science**: Now this was an additional career i stumbled over in the process of finding my path. For those who may not know, actuaries are business professionals that spend time calculating risks for insurance companies and businesses by using applied mathematics. It has a promising job growth outlook, a very good pay, and low stress tolerance. I mean, what more could you ask for in a career? Additionally, I've noticed overtime in college, my math skills have tremendously improved. Although currently I have a little bit of trouble in calculus, I find it the least painful, and the most interesting out of all the classes I'm taking this semester.

* **CEO/Entrepreneurship**: This seems like a pipe dream to me at this point, but I'd love to run a company. I look up to entrepreneurs and business magnates like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs. Occasionally in my spare time I'd come up with business ideas and new inventions too. I admire the prestige, power, and respect that comes with being a CEO or a successful entrepreneur. Maybe if I got an economics degree and an MBA it could be possible, but like I said, it seems near impossible to me.


So with these career paths. How can I be able to figure out which one is best for me? Do any of you guys have any tips or ideas that could work for me coming to a good conclusion of what I want to do? Many of you are probably pulling your hair out right now from reading this, but I'll need all the feedback and advice I can get, positive and negative. Thanks to anybody that can offer any help!


Also, idk if this is helpful but here are some of my interests/skills:

* Digital Music Production

* Photography

* Graphic Design

* Fashion

* Writing (Argumentative Essays and Creative Writing)

* Money, Cash flow (Really. I like making money off of selling anything or whenever I find the opportunity, currently making money off of doing other people's math assignments and essays lol)

EDIT: by the way, please suggest any other careers for me, money and job growth are important factors to me.
