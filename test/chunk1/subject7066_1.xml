	<TEXT> Not sure how many hours I've put into it, but I'm going to keep this same save file. I'll create a new account if I want to start again. Reason I want to keep it is to finish everything I possibly can, with the exception of 900 korok seeds, before the dlc comes out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ive had this happen a lot as well. But I also have it downloaded through steam. And when I run MS through steam it usually works more often than the nexon launcher. Not sure if that has anything to do with it, or if it's because both copies or downloaded on to 2 different HDDs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it the same as the first section where you have to complete the main quests to do the PQ? Also, how hard is hard mode if you only have 50 arc? Because you get 5 per PQ on hard, correct?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well about a week ago I finally got back onto MS after being off for about 6 months just recently finished getting 5th job on my 210 NL. I only have 40 arcane power, will have 50 after today's dailies. After the dailies Im slowly working through Chu Chu island but it's a little slow with 40/100 Arc. I feel like I'm missing something..or is it this slow to gaining arc? 

Is there a faster  way to gain arcane stones? Haven't even found any from mobs. Is there a certain mob that has a better chance to drop them? Or nodestones. I've only found like 4 NL applicable nodestones and 2 that were for other classes. 

How long did it take you to reach Atleast 100 arcane power?  </TEXT>
