	<TITLE> Is there a mP Game mode with an army of bots vs an army of bots lead by a few players? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I was just wondering about this, because it is pretty much the thing I thought of when I played the first MB game, will it be possible to play 1v1 human and a bunch of bots (150 bots) in a battle. 

Now that there are so many expansions and DLCs, I do wonder is there any with a game mode like that? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> After 10+ years I'm just done with TW games for now, I can't anymore... </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been playing them for over 10 years, and I can't anymore, because of the numerous and numerous flaws that just stacked up over all this time. The cons are way too numerous compared to the pros. 


- Every fucking release CA removes some feature(s) that everybody liked no total war game has good sieges, 
- no total war game has good AI
- no total war game has good diplomacy 
- no total war game has fixed its bugs (all of them are a bugfest without mods) 

- only RTW somehow got the battle collision right every game after it is either horrible or bearable (mtw2,stw2,wtw), 

- most of total war games have issues with optimization 

For fuck sake the troop system just doesn't work, an entire cavalry charge can be interrupted by one single soldier (I have seen this a gazzilion times), ranged units always have to focus on "one" unit thus they cannot split their fire on several smaller ones, artillery is either useless or OP and has many issues, in some games cavalry cannot dismount, then in most of games some units just get "stuck" to the enemy no matter how easy it should be for them to separate etc.. etc... And whenever you ask for any change or improvement then it's way too much of a task/burden for the developers, meanwhile Witcher 3 has no loading screens and entertaining side quests which everybody said can't be done.   

What also came with the time is my own knowledge of warfare increased and thus made TW look less and less appealing. Safe to say sieges in every TW game are not even close to resembling to their respective period region. Battle are so-so in some games while in other ones... That's why I can't stand imbeciles who want a WW1/WW2 game, just, just... What an impossible lack of understanding how video games work and how those wars were fought. The majority of TW playing community has a shocking out of touch view of battles and ancient warfare, I would say that CoD fans know way more about modern guns and infantry warfare while the average TW buyer probably knows 300, Gladiator, Kingdom Of Heaven and maybe Game of Thrones. 

Eventually I realized that the old games just can't be fixed with mods, no matter how much the premise of the mod is awesome and the new games have a skeleton mod support and a shitty engine designed to get "EPICX SCREEENSHOOTS SPARTA ROME YEAAAH!!!!"

I also have a had a hard time accepting the turn system, its just dumb and counterproductive, it simply does not reflect how armies behave when moving on the field, where barely anything has be taken into account (food, native population, many seasonal effects, hygiene, fatigue, morale...)

So that's it, I need a bit more from my total war games then epic screenshots and a boring pastime ala Civ games, and I don't think I will come back to them unless for an awesome super good mod. However I truely doubt that CA will ever make an EXCELLENT game  because there is simply no competition, so just like Paradox and whoever makes Civ games they are gonna milk, milk and milk some more... 


EDIT: The TW games need a radical new era, the more I think about this, there just has to be some new upgrades that would make any previous game tedious and unplayable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I swear every time I try to play MB games again, I go to the options to fix up the graphics and stuff, and every time I see "Combatant AI"I get so freakin pissed, because I don't want a stupid peasant to block my mace blows with some stupid stick or a club with the skill of a knight.

What I am trying to say is, that one of the most needed area's of improvement for MB is that different units have to have different AI just like other stats. Or for example, a broader span of animations, there should be a separate skill which dictates how capable you are with a weapon, essentially opening more attack/defense animations for the character.  </TEXT>

As for Warband, I only managed to find The Deluge mod, but its [M]. Which really a shame, since WaS was a good idea but the vanilla is too shallow. 


So any cool mods with the 17ct Polish Comonwealth and Eastern Europe out there?

	<TEXT> I just watched a video from a German youtuber about the Bf1 campaigns, and he notes that Austrian soldiers have Northern German accents!?

So I wonder, is that true, can other German players confirm that? I mean if it is, I find it just infuriating that a company that large with probably one of the biggest budgets for games can't even get the accents right for one of the major European languages!  

But you know it was really important to have those numerous millions of black soldiers in the German empire represented...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am playing some mods in which I feel the years go too fast, I want to change that a bit, but the only guide I have found so far is rough and not really well explained (RedEye on TWC).

It is also frustrating because in one mod, you are using high tier units after a certain year and you cannot recruit/retrain them (With Fire and Sword 2). Which means by the time you can recruit them at a descent scale they are already gone and replaced with usually more boring ones. 

I am a little bit familiar with the data folder but not enough to tamper with it myself, I just thought that making the year take more turns would be easier, but apparently its messy...

	<TEXT> I have played T2 for some 5hrs maybe, so I would like to know the ins and outs of some interesting mechanics, one of them being Heat Shield. 

-  How much damage does it actually do to other Titans?

-  Is it better to hold the Shield on the enemy titan until it expires or just melee the titan in cqc?

-  Does it stop/weaken non-projectile weapons, like the ones from Ion or pilots?

-  Does it stop/weaken all projectiles? If several Northstars are shooting at it, will it work? 

I think I will remember some other questions later one.

	<TEXT> This started irking me when I fired up the Titanfall 2 campaign, I was like " great yet not another bland white guy with brownish/blackish hair, clean shaven..."

Then I started thinking and there a few bearded man protagonists (no female ones though) but blonde, I am really struggling to think of a blonde female/male on the poster, the color of their hair not questionable or obtruded, they are a normally built human with no gimmicky art style or anything of that sort. 

I really can't remember any, much less a blonde bearded female. 

I do not count potential "Thor" games, there's got to be some I guess.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess something in similar  direction to The Name of The Rose or brother Cadfael. 

Some things that really would make it better for me :

- The author isn't projecting modern values or giving me lectures through the medieval world

- It is preferably set in between 1000 and 1150 or late 16ct (but then it has to be mainland Europe) 

- It has NO plot in modern day

- Historical accuracy has to be high but I won't mind fictional characters

- No generic flat characters that lead the plot, I really can't stand that

- A little bit of grit won't hurt either

Essentially I want something that completely immerses me in the medieval world with its visuals, problems, daily lives, issues...

	<TITLE> Do you think the term "Sci-Fi" is getting used too much? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-08 19:00:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Genres have their cons and pros, people can really get frustrated arguing about genres and how movies should be sorted etc... Which to me is pointless, genres should serve us as useful tool of elimination not a pointless bureaucratic sorting tool. To me a movie's genre is only really useful for someone who hasn't seen it, someone who is searching for something new. Usually that someone wants to eliminate movies that are of no interest and narrow down the possibility  of finding a fitting movie. 
In essence if somebody tells you that they are eager to see a new movie, and tell you that they want to see a dark melodrama it certainly eliminates Adam Sandler comedies. 

So it is because of this that I a SF fan since childhood can get really frustrated. I can't count how many times I have seen buzz on the internet about some awesome SF movie or somebody told me that they have seen an awesome SF movie only to get a movie without any really SF elements in it. What do I mean by that? 

Well the "Science" part of the "Science Fiction" is too often neglected if you ask me. People have this wild idea that just because a movie has robots, space, big explosions and supernatural powers it makes it Sci-Fi, that it puts the movie into the same category as the 2001: A Space Odyssey for example. I mean honestly how can you see The Martian and put into the same category with something as as Jupiter Ascending?

You know in the late 19th and early 20th century you had something called "Sword Sorcery" which is basically a type of fantasy genre, it developed another subgenre called "Sword Planet". It is basically fantasy in space. Which a lot of movies today are, yet they are called SF. It is almost a type of movie "racism" where certain superficial elements force people to judge the actual substance and categorize it like that. 

So I guess I wish people when they say SF they would actually mean a movie that has a foundation in science, that it respects science and tries to use it as a springboard for an imaginative creative story. I don't want a scientifically 100% accurate movie mind you, that is also not SF, but it needs to have that initial plausibility and to be set in actual futuristic scientific taught. There is another type of wanna be SF movie that also bother me, and they are basically about MODERN social issues and ethical allegories coated in SF as to appear "clever" and "deep" but in the end they are like a preacher that offers you candy if you listen to him for two hours *cough*Neil Blomkamp*cough*. 



P.S. Lord Of the Rings books to me are actually more SF than Star Wars for example, since Tolkien involved a lot of "science" in them, he created fictional languages, maps, histories and calendars(each race have their own calendar mind you). Not just that he created them, but he did use some actually empiric knowledge and hard work for them to make them feel credible and to have the sense "seriousness", an ordinary person or a writer would simply not be able to create them. That's why it never made sense to me when he said Middle-earth was just a side activity or a hobby for him. 
Anyway those books certainly involve more scientific work then all the Star Wars scripts combined, especially after the New Hope.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This server problem today really illustrated what I mean, people leave and maybe there is but I do not see any accommodation for that at the and of the match. 

I personally think that is not fair for losing a rank for playing a 2v5 match, I just don't see any justification for that. I have read the new blog and I have seen no mention to fix this (rather simple) problem. Just let the losing team of the hook and that's it. 

Surrender isn't the solution for now or we are doing something wrong, since every time I selected the Surrender option, my teammates and I got penalized, so I do not understand have can you leave the match without penalty. I don't see any other option in the menu.

So in the end I waste a bunch of my time just to get a goddamn lesser rank.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically some jolly co-operation in ranked and in casual, why not. 

I would just like some teammates that communicate and remember that we are supposed to have FUN in the end, so if you have short temper and are ultra-competitive try to find some other team. I do want to win mind you, my ranks dropped dramatically lately because the teams are not using communication, but not at the cost of my nerves.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For two days straight I am getting teammates that are dead silent, meaning they do not communicate. They do not use the mics(although they have them), the chat barely or even ping signal. 

Only form of communication they give is whining, bitching, raging and flaming over the chat. That is also usually the only time you hear them on the mic. 

Then for some reason lately a lot of people are leaving, and my question is, how am I supposed to fight for ranks when half of my team is gone, why can't I "surrender with honor"? I surrender, the other team gets the win and we move on, seems fair to me. This way I either get stuck in a pointless struggle and get punished for it or I leave and get punished for it.

Back to the mic/com problem, I think people outside of North America really got the short end of the stick in this one, I think a big reason why people do not talk over mic is because they can't speak English or they are really uncomfortable speaking it or worst case scenario, there is somebody else in the team who speaks their native language, goodbye to team work then... 

I have worked a lot in a background with people not sharing their native language, and what I have seen and learned from that is that people are gonna go to great lengths to speak their native language and avoid English, so it seems this experience is repeating for me in R6.  

So I just pray to God I get people from UK and Scandinavia. 

EDIT: 
It seems I have been playing with even bigger imbeciles then I thought, because several times I pointed out we should "surrender" or forfeit or do something like that, but none of them responded.

	<TEXT> Do NOT I repeat DO NOT put the armor panels IN THE VERY BEGINING, you are preventing your team from spreading out, or setting up traps or basically doing anything besides ending up as fish in a barrel. 

My advice is, do everything except that until the very last 10-15 sec, then you see what the situation is and improvise. I personally like to do a "tower defense system", where I "stimulate" the enemy team down a certain path. I let a corridor open but close down other possibilities, that way there is a strong possibility that the enemy will use it. 

Anyway, my point is do not sabotage your entire team with something you can do later on anyway.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> EDIT: I just want to say after seeing many posts here, that this is one of the best sub-reddits in gaming that I visited. Nobody screamed and told me to fuck myself because I offended their favorite game, on the contrary they've read this tiresome post and offered thoughts and discussion, which is amazing. I wish one could do this in other places. Anyway, Vermintide definitely attracted the cool kind of folks to this subreddit!



I hate using clickbait phrases but I think this is a fun game that doesn't want you to have fun...

DISCLAIMER: I really want this game to succeed, it think it is an underrated gem with a big stain that is preventing it to shine. If it weren't for the stain, I would buy the game for my friends without flinching... 

So, to me this game was amazing at first, it was the sense of danger, adventure, teamwork, exploring, the challenge... It has persevering grim atmosphere of which I can't get enough, it even has descent writing voice acting. The combat system is mostly good (though the net code can be shoddy), what surprised me most is how fun are both the MELEE and the RANGED aspects. 

It is also mostly very simple and intuitive, you really get the hang of it really fast, both the combat and the other mechanics. So in the beginning I was having lots of fun, but then I got bored with my weapons and wanted to test out the harder difficulties....

And damn does this game want me to not have fun and enjoyment. Now my comfort zone is hard/nightmare, these difficulties are challenging but not cheap. But when you put tomes and grimoires into play, I'm sorry but I can't get the image of a sadistic dev. out of my head. It is one thing to offer a challenge and a greater reward for it, it is an whole other thing to cause discomfort to the player to the point they can't relax and enjoy the game, because they are practically crippled. I personally would have preferred to have maybe more stormvermin or something in that sense, basically increase the danger don't decrease the options. This bothers me even more because it turns the game into a co-op grim adventure fun to a cynical stats, numbers and "muh twitch reflexes" chore. It would be really scary if this game catered more to the CS:GO/DOTA2 crowd.

Then you have the roll, which often spits in your face. To have any descent chance of getting something you must go through the grueling ordeal of playing nightmare/grimoires, where you have to pray to GOD that all the players are rational human beings, and no glitch or bug of greater importance happens, because then you have to go all over again, which brings me to...

I find it incredibly unfair, that a player that plays the game from the start but for some reason does not finish the map at the end and gets nothing if the team fails, while a player that joins seconds before the end of the map gets the dice roll. That is just brutal, and it creates a disgusting behavior of players just trying to join games that have already started, because why risk it and waste time when you can join in-game and see is the team any worth or has any progress? I did this also, because you just don't have the time to go over and over and over again a map until you get a descent team only so you can unlock one freaking key...

Quests Contracts was my hope, but it just made the problem a bit less annoying, it is still so damn hard to get a weapon you kind of what. 

I also just have to mention this, once I got bored with the dwarf's one handed hammer, and prayed to a melee weapon. 4 times in a row I GOT THE SAME EXACT HAMMER! Then I fused some OTHER RANDOM weapons and GOT THE SAME EXACT HAMMER! It was a miracle I continued playing on after that... 

I honestly wish Fatshark takes one of these routes:

- Dump the loot system entirely, and replace with a currency system and a challenge system. To get items you have to farm some kind of currency but at least you will get what you specifically want but put some kind of (reasonable)challenges that unlock the ability to buy some weapons. For example you get the option of buying a specific warhammer after you kill 50 stormvermin with a warhammer.

- Raise the price, and create a longer campaign, a type of campaign that after you finish it will make you think one round was more then enough. Of course you could replay missions or the campaign on higher difficultly and get better loot, Dark Souls games actually do a very similar thing to this and they are selling crazy, only difference would be is that Vermintide insits on co-op, although a lot of DS players spent most of their time in co-op too.
Again remove the dice loot system, and use another, with less RNG factor. In fact, any system that doesn't force you to forget the fun of playing the game and enjoying yourself.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So what do you do to isolate the mod that creates crashing(conflict)? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-20 19:36:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am sure there has to be a lot of players here with a lot of mods, since every few days we get a few mods especially for warhammer. So I was wondering what do you do when you stumble on crashing, meaning some mods are conflicting but how do you isolate them? 

For me it is really tedious and it really spotlights the shortcomings of the launcher. Essentially I enable 3-4 mods, then start the game then a campaign loading, then I add another round of mods and repeat the process.

Trouble comes when you isolate a mod that causes ctd at the startup, but then you have to go all over again to find a mod that causes  ctd when starting a campaign. It always ends up draining me and taking a lot of my time. 

Now I can't help but think that but if the mod menager was more organized this would be much easier, with like a large grid based menu and where you can create mod groups and turn them off/on. 

So what do you guys do to solve this? I do have to note, that before posting this I tried to find a simillar post, and I've noticed that people downvote anything that has to do with a similar subject like mods, mod manager and criticism of them.

The old twitch, looked kind of dull, pretty much generic, but it was okay it didn't really gouge my eyes or something.

But the current Twitch model to me basically comes down to devs thinking:
"People can't tell Twitch is a girl, so how do we make her girlier?"
"I have an idea, let's just throw some lipstick and makeup!" 

So at least, I kind of wish we could use the old Twitch, because this one reminds on those stupid childreen cartoons where female monsters and animals were lipstick... </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So far I have a little over 200h, in the game (I know its not that much for a TW game), and I have enjoyed at least one campaign with every faction except Chaos Warriors, note the use of word "enjoyed" and not "played". 

That is because one of the problems that I feared that come over from Attila and its horde mechanic.  So the Empire and everybody else comes to the north and starts stalking me. However I didn't have this problem in last two campaigns, not sure did CA patch something or new mods that I used. But that is not the point of my post, it is the size of the map that makes this problem more accentuated.

You see I never feel like I am in a far away distant north, it never gives you the sense of isolation and wasteland that it should, and by proxy that makes Kislev feel too small, it really doesn't feel like a huge vast steppe more like a slightly longer walk. That's why it never feels like you are this Chaos warlord fighting and gathering strength far in the north to invade the southern weaklings, more like the turbulent neighbor that isn't that hard to find. 

But then when you come to the Empire, a disappointing amount of provinces feel so tiny and insignificant. Norland, Averland and Ostermark have only two cities! As a matter of fact, it is that, that ruined a lot my Orc campaigns, when I finally reached the Empire, it just felt too tiny and like a pushover.

My biggest worry is, that this will never be addressed or fixed, correct me if I am wrong, but no DLC so far in any TW game, expanded the map? And the mods hands are tied... 

Do you find this problem too? Please note that I "feel" these issues when I play with other factions too, but playing Reikland, Orcs, Chaos and the Vampires really is a bummer when the Empire feels like a mediocre sized divided country.

Now before they used to activate around 90C but now they do it a bit to late so my PC reboots. 

- My warranty has expired

- I have all the drivers and Win updated

- The fans work even at lower speeds, there is really no discussion about that. BUT when I instruct them manually, they will only activate if I set the intensity above 80%, after that I can lower it. So they won't work if I first set them on 40%. 

- I have deleted and re-installed the drivers several times.

- I had the PC for about two years before this appeared.

- When it appeared the only thing of note I can say is that Witcher 3 was installed and the first time it ever (as far as I know)happened was when somebody was playing FIFA 15.

- At the time I used MSI Afterburner for Monitoring FPS, I and a few other people, thought that it was what messed up the fans, but I cannot prove it nor I am sure about it.

- Another peculiar thing is that, both AMD Radeon Settings and MSI when set on Automatic, are showing that the fan speed is moving, but it isn't, the fans aren't spinning.

	<TITLE> [TOMT][Cartoon] Late 90's-early 20's Weird rip off of the X-men and Superman, with a Vampire villain! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-05 20:31:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have seen only one episode of this cartoon it goes roughly like this:

Some kind of "energy" or power exists among humans, and government is trying (or some corporation) to round them up. 
However one facility is actually a trap, as a hidden Ancient Vampire is draining this energy from these individuals. He has bat-like wings, a necklace, dark purple/blue hair, he is pale, his upper body is naked and his bigger then an average human. He constantly boasts how ancient and powerful he is. 

After a while this kid enters and turns into a Superman knockoff. The Superman knockoff wears a lot of red, and I think has big "U" on his chest. but the Vampire drains him too and the Superman knockoff dissolves into green goo, however the vamp doesn't realize at first that the boy survived the attack as he escaped through the green goo. So a large part of the episode is the vampire playing hide and seek with this boy and the Superman knock off.

At the end some friends of the boy arrive and together they defeat the vampire, I think one of them has white hair and some kind of telekinetic powers, I think he is crucial and gives the ending blow to the Vampire. 

The episode ends with vampires face forming in the night sky, I can't remember was it a cloud of smoke or the stars.

Some notes:

- I remember the beginning of the episode had eerily similar plot and theme to 90's Xmen, about controlling a minority in the population. This minority had something "supernatural" or superpowered about them.
 
- When I watched the cartoon I was about 14 and was kind of not watching cartoons anymore, so I was kind of smug, however that vampire made me watch it, because he was genuinely frightening at first and later amusing.

- Superman knockoff isn't just because of his power set, it is also because of his bland personality and voice why I call him that.

- I got the distinct impression that Vampire isn't a regular Villain in the show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those that do not know WWE treatment of women had its ups and downs , but in last 10 years well... ugh it's hard not to sound like a feminist criticizing those... Anyway not only WWE started treating women like real pro wrestlers but they gave them the headliner Main Event in a Hell in a Cell match where the competitors are expected to take more brutal bumps which these women did. In fact just the Main Event alone is a HUGE thing. 

And this is where the all feminist bullshit comes in place or rather the lack there off, they do NOT care about women struggling and fighting to reach an honored place like men, they want stuff to be granted to them until the whining becomes unbearable. Just like the UFC, they are absolutely silent when some women take matters into their own hands and do hard work, oh no no we don't want that do we? 

In a sense they are really similar to the spoiled 18/19 century noblewomen who expected to be treated like some kind of precious house pet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WoS,CiG and HatG combined are 10 euros and from what I have seen they really seem mediocre (at best), they do not have any amazing overhaul mods (please correct me on this one) and they have no overall affect on the Grand Campaign? 

So are they worth the money? 

EDIT: Looking back, I remember even the people that liked RTW2 were thoroughly dissapointed with these DLCs, I personally was so crushed that WoS didn't have Sicily (does it have Asia Minor coast cities?) and it just looked so boring, why couldn't Sparta just march and crush Athens and end the war, they didn't seem like they tried to replicate some of the important intricacies of that war.

It's not like in every other militaristic game you can just rush a tank alone. Not to mention Battlefield is over 10 years old and one of the best selling gaming franchises. 

Now I do know there are players dumb enough that will actually do this, and around the 10th death they will maybe figure out, but they are an minority and are they really the ones you should be giving gaming strategy advice?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was watching the Walker brothers from Nostalgia Critic talking about ratings in a vlog video, and I've noticed how many even open minded people take the ratings seriously. 

The impression I get is that a lot of people think it will be mental suicide for a child to watch an inappropriate rating and that you must protect them at all costs from that. 

I grew up in a country where parents don't care about ratings, horror movies and straight up porn are only taboos for them, and even that I do not understand honestly. Most of the kids I knew simply watched what it suits them and it just so happens most of them  disliked horrors and avoided them, the ones that liked them, well they liked them and watched them.

My point is, why are people so damn convinced that if a 11 old watches Deadpool, Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight or Saving Private Ryan they will have these mental scars for life and they will never ever be a functioning individuals.  </TEXT>

It really makes such a type of battle unnecessary frustrating, so I kind of hope there is some solution to this, if not CA really has to do something about, I mean they ALREADY DID IT! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> No Cheats or the Ability to save game after a battle during AI turns ruins Total War games for me... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-15 23:51:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Look since RTW, total war games were prone to CTDs especially with mods. Even discounting CTDs there are many reasons that might prevent you from finishing the turn and saving the game. 

How many times did it happen to you, you play a HUGE epic battle and just at the end of it or during AI turns after it for whatever reason you were unable to save the game. For me that's a huge dealbreaker, I just do not want to repeat a 30 minute battle, I just do not  want to fucking do it, especially if the battle took a very specific course.

Now in the old days you had the console and you can force a victory (if you won) and move on, but now.... This really bugs me that the fans are not more vocal about this, can't CA gives a damn autosave feature after the battles (during AI turns) or better yet a save feature for inside the battles !?

Now a little bit of background here, I have finished every Dark Souls game (including Demon Souls and Bloodborne) and in those games you cannot save, ever. But there the boss battles do not last 30+min so it doesn't feel so much like a chore to go back to them, while in TW it just feels like moving a boulder again and doing a math test at the same time, you just don't want to do it, you should be over with it. 

Now also chances are that those huge epic battles push your rig because honestly TW games have always been horribly optimized so if you have nothing less but a beast those huge huge battles can be painful to play. I pretty much abandon the campaign after that, because I feel exhausted and cheated.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> After 4 weeks of sprinting I am a little confused. (Skinny fat here) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-24 01:02:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> DISCLAIMER: I am not INJURED, I am just curious about types and reasons for pain I feel.


A small introduction: I am sprinting 3 days a week, or rather every second day and after the 3 session I take two days off. I do small short burst of sprints until I cannot do them anymore. Any exercise I do I feel I have to do until push the limit because when I do it differently I never feel any progress. 

Now, long time a go when I was jogging just do something because I always wanted to do any kind of physical activity, I felt a pain in my right shoulder from time to time. 

Now after I sprint it is considerably less rare, but the last time I worked it felt a bit more painful, and the truth is I just don't get, before running I try to loose in it, I do a little bit of exercise moving the joint and everything. 

My problem is that I do not understand is why does it hurt since it is not frequent, consistent or makes any sense to me. Sometimes it JUST HURTS sometimes not except the normal overall fatigue. 

Also to note, the pain stops really fast after I stop the activity and it doesn't bother me doing push ups or something else. 

I also feel a small bit of pain in my front leg muscles, when I start running or walking fast or when I twitch my legs, however when I start warming up for the sprint and the sprinting it disappears and I feel really great, then it comes back after while. It is a very small dull pain it barely bothers me, but some people told me that I should stop sprinting until it stops, but I think all the hard work will be for nothing if I take any bigger pause then 5 days.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So are "Historical" documentaries worse than Hollywood at this point? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-03 03:54:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all I know this doesn't have any specific quote, but seriously where would I put a post about bad history in general and why it exists then in r/badhistory ? I just don't see any other audience on Reddit that would be potentially be more interested in this then this one.

The reasons for why I would argue that documentaries are worse than movies that are simple, the common man and woman usually assume when they are watching a documentary that it is 99% correct, because it is supposed to be a type of educational program. In fact an alarming, I repeat alarming rate of people take Hollywood dead serious when it comes to movies, I have encountered HISTORY STUDENTS that take the movie Gladiator at face value, and even 300!

So when you take that into consideration, just imagine how much, "damage" documentaries are doing?!
Now here is what I do not understand, why are documentaries trying to be Hollywood, when Hollywood exists and already took the spot, this means they are chasing for a niche audience but as collateral damage they are corrupting many minds with ridiculous statements and ideas. 

Here would be some of their largest sins:

Most of documentaries make these flat over-arching statements(Greatest, Longest, Most Powerful etc...) that frankly not even Hollywood dares sometimes, they blatantly avoid mentioning a lot of information (I remember watching three documentaries about the first crusade back to back, and all of them had a different list of the crusader leaders, and even if you merged them you still wouldn't get all of them), a lot of them do not introduce the concept of "sources" to the audience seeing how invaluable they are  to history and most of them just try to accentuate myths or rather if we had historical documentaries in the 19cnth Vikings would always wear horned helmets.

	<TEXT> That is because to date, I could swear my life on it every 3d TW game has been left in unfinished state, and most of them have seriously game breaking bugs! I would say  NTW and STW2 are the most polished ones, can't remember any game destroying things about them, except the disgusting engine and the good old AI, oh the AI....

Every 3d TW game's AI is bad or horrible at something, both CAI and BAI, the ammount of progress made about it is to say the least "laizy"?

Then the optimization, has there ever been a well optimized TW game? A vast and I mean around 95% PCs I have used(NOT just owned, USED) to play TW had bearable or good framerate at best during some parts of the battle. For crying out loud I played on PCs that run Crysis 3, Witcher 3, Battlefornt on ultra with mostly smooth framerates but still struggle with ultra  STW2 or RTW2 or ATW. Usually the case is that TW is not well optimized for most of modern PCs of its generation and the older ones are not designed to detect modern hardware, gee.... It is not something I am pulling out of thin air, optimization complaints are practically a staple of TW fandom! 

So those are the reasons that I curse SEGA and CA and pray every day that we finally get some competition, finally force them to move their asses and chill with the latest disgusting trend of DLC galore!!

	<TITLE> I swear Swedish speakers are more Deaf when they are speaking Swedish! (The annoying: vad sa du) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-06 04:06:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been visiting Sweden  for about 4 years, in that time I have learned most of the basic phrases and understand most of mundane day talk. I have spoken with many Swedish speakers, both native and immigrant both on Swedish and other languages and this is my conclusion. 

About 1/4 of their sentences in a conversation are " vad sa du ". In fact that seems to be the instinctive response, if someone says anything but "hey" and its variants to a Swedish speaker, the response is always " (Urskta!) Vad sa du? ". Now yes it is not uncommon for example that an English speaker answers with "Sorry, what?", but it is not the almost exclusive answer that the Swedish speakers give. As a matter of fact, often when I approach a person in Sweden "Sorry you speak English, blah blah blah", I get a direct response, but if I ask someone to ask something for me on Swedish, it is always "Vad sa du?" and then they repeat the question.


I can't count how many times I have spoken with a Swedish speaker on English without hearing a single "what?" or "can you repeat that" and then ELSE someone calls them/ engages them in a conversation on Swe and it's just "Vad sa du?""Vad sa du?""Vad sa du?""Vad sa du?""Vad sa du?". 

Same thing when I am overhearing conversations, especially people on phone. 

Please understand this isn't some troll post or something, I usually try to articulate myself very well speaking  other languages and hate it when someone keeps saying "what?", sometimes it gets so infuriating that I really want to go to a Swedish person talking with a phone on a train and scream "GO TO A DAMN AUDIOLOGIST!" 

EDIT:
This isn't about me talking to Swedes, it is about when Swedes talk to each other.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Today my itch to read the Alexiad got to me, immediately I went to Amazon, and then I got a really interesting idea.

I want to read the Alexiad, so a Byzantine author, then an Islamic Source (probably Arab) and a Crusader one. 
My rules are: I have to read the Alexiad and the other sources have to be focused on the First Crusade and if possible be contemporaries. 

This is where I get slightly confused:
I know Fulcher of Chartress is one of the most used authors, but on amazon I found these two books:

- A History of the Expedition to Jerusalem, 1095-1127 

- The First Crusade: "The Chronicle of Fulcher of Chartres" and Other Source Materials (The Middle Ages Series)

On one hand I kind of wanted to read only from one author to get more "immersed", but on the other hand the second book seems to be the superior one, with Fulcher and other sources even Hebrew! But somehow they have almost the same number of pages... 

As for the Islam source, I only managed to find this:

- The Book of Contemplation: Islam and the Crusades

The author isn't a contemporary of crusades, so if you could suggest me a contemporary author of the Crusades from the Islamic world, it would be really great help.  For some reason, the Islamic authors keep getting mashed together into compilations about all Crusades. </TEXT>

How do they, you know "consume" the brand? With some exceptions a vast majority of Sonic games in last 20 years are a shitshow, so...? 

The thought that there are massive fandoms of a blue hedgehog sends shivers down my spine, I mean really what does Sonic represent, what is he about, how does he engage you.... why couldn't Sonic be replaced with some other character model in the best Sonic games, what difference would it make? 

You see where I'm going at, why can't Sega either focus on making one excellent Sonic game, don't they realize they are destroying their own property or let the damn thing die. And if they let it die, why can't those fans do it too?  </TEXT>

"Police do not have any evidence indicating that the attacker was connected to any radical Islamic groups, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, Yoshihide Suga, told journalists on Tuesday.

Currently, the police did not send over any evidence that would point to the suspects connection to any of the Islamist groups, he said."

I find it interesting after all #NotAllMuslims and other SJW crap or media downplaying Islam in killings, it still has to be specifically mentioned that Isis is not to blame in a case that is non-Isis as humanely possible. 

I mean, when I was reading the reports I didn't even play with the idea because it was ridiculous, it was just some disturbed guy killing disabled people with knives, in a country let's face it a lot of people find weird anyway(Just google "Japan weird"). 

The point is, ISIS and Islam got into public conscience so much  that every case of violence is under a loop for the possibility of ISIS, despite the all hush hush from regressives. Then again mass people and mass media consistently show how dumb they are when they think every crime in the World has to be ISIS.

And honestly it kinda bugs me, whenever someone says "I feel that" it is as if they are trying to protect their argument from criticism or give it more weight since it is what they "feel".

I am seeing it as a reflection of modern PC culture that went overboard, which means you should not be criticized or that your feelings should not ever be insulted, even by rational argument.

	<TEXT> SJWs, regressive media and the similar sort, are gonna have a field day, I honestly think there will be a storm of propaganda about right wing toxicity, masculinity, internalized racism (the gunman was Iranian) yada yada. 

I think it will take 10 more Islamic massacres to make them shut up and stop brainwashing the people. In a way it's a lose lose situation right now. 

a) If an attack is Islam motivated then the media are: "Crusades, Iraq, Racism, Notall, Prayers" blah blah

b) If the attack is not Islam motivated then the media are : "SEE! SEE! SEE! We have to do something abot this, Twitter and Facebook and Goverments start creating safe space, especially for Muslims!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kraut [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmzfkg1szDA)

That is, a huge amount of youtube channels that are basically dedicated on reactions to the latest feminism, sjw, regressive etc. stuff. Most of them have some avatar and those black glasses which I presume is because they are not copyrighted!? 

There are interesting channels among them, but jeesh dude there is only so many times I can hear the same reaction over and over and over again. It is really starting to get redundant, especially the channels that just bash (fuck you dumb feminist, this is crazy and illogical, etc) without any wit or proper explanation. For every cool channel it seems you get three dull generic ones, and half of them have livestreams and podcasts that somehow people have time to watch. 

I am not saying we should we worried, yet, but it does create some mild concern for me, it's just funny how the whole "every action has an reaction" works. You do have to accept that these people LIVE from the SJW nonsense, they have financial gain in their insanity.

	<TEXT> The way some people think of mbti, it comes of as a rigged self fulfilling prophecy, in their logic UFC fighters would all be XSTPs, but I disagree with that, so do you have some interesting thoughts or suggestions ?

Miesha Tate - ENFJ 

She seems incredibly sweet, extroverted and outgoing. She respects most of her opponents, she also takes defeats like a champ which I guess I associate with xNFJs to be so emotional and mature at the same time. 

Some other thoughts I have:

Connor Mcgreggor - ExTP - Cocky, outgoing. chatty and not that good in long term planning?

Brock Lesnar - ISTx - This dude has so much tunnel vision and focus, hard to to think any other type. He rarely if ever discusses anything and seems very pigheaded. 

Holly Holm - INxJ - She is so slow and methodical, almost like a surgeon and is never if ever passionate on the outside when it comes to UFC. She also has no mercy when criticizing herself.

	<TITLE> So I just finished Yhorm and a questline and.... I am really pissed.... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-01 15:54:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I, with my beautiful knight character am entering Yhorm's chamber, finally the one character that left the biggest impression on me in ANY DS trailer, I've heard all the build up and saw that there is a lot of guides for him (didn't read them) and tried to check any lore on him during my playthrough.

Then I see the Siegward Bro coming in and wanting to fulfill his promise, I'm thinking "I hope this will be a long and epic fight, however wins". 

We start fighting, Yhrom hits me like truck and then an explosion is heard, Yhorm is incapacitated. So epic, my friend saves me, I get a few hacks, and continue to dance. 

Then Yhorm starts to go in flame form, the fight looks more epic and, and, and Siegward blasts him again... And again, and again, and again... 

In the end I do a badass visceral attack but feel completely dead inside. What a disappointment... I used only two estus flasks!


So what I am trying to say is, Yhorm had a huge build up behind him and Siegward completely ruined the fight. I mean, what the hell was FS thinking? They know players like to finish the questlines and yes get a bit help from it but this is downright irresponsible, to ruin an entire bossfight!? With a questline that isn't even that hard! You would have to be a seriously bad player to have trouble defeating Yhorm like this,  SO damn bad. 

One of the reasons I love DS games are good bossfights, that make you want more of the fight when you lose and that give you this huge sense of accomplishment when you beat them, and this questline basically takes it away. 

Which brings me to a criticism of DS games that I had from the very first boss on my first playthrough of DS1. 
I hate it when a  game does not let met to enjoy the game. What do I mean by that? Well if I wanted to fight Yhorm again, I would have to start a new character from scratch just to reach Yhorm and let's face it not all DS players are PvP gods that get that shit done in a day. DS2 had the closest thing to a compromise, but it wasn't quiet there. Why would it be to much to ask to simply have the option to replay the bossfight, you could even test a lot of other equipment and strategies, it would be so damn good. For crying out loud, you've earned it! At least beating a boss without a phantom should let you do this. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Namely they confuse the hell out of me. 

You see I when I play online games on PC1, I open tabs on my browser, play youtube, open images and none of those ruin my play session, ping just rarely if ever goes up.  Sometimes I even accidentally leave a download going on and more often then not it doesn't affect my gaming, so far only Steam download makes an impact. 

My understanding is that all those "actions" take a backseat to my video game's connection. But...

The second someone on the PC2 starts doing pretty much anything, like opening Facebook, just opening it, it destroys my connection on PC1, in gaming that is. Basically my ping goes sky high every time a new site is loading on PC2. 

What I do not understand is why can't I limit that connection or more specifically why can't I make the games top priority so everything else has to wait its turn? And I have tried looking for software or modem options, but no luck, and why does only PC2 destroy my gaming experience?  In essence some kind of priority order, where one application gets to use the juice first and what is left the others use? It is obviously not much since as I said I play games and youtube on PC1 and I have no major problems.

A side note, I've noticed that Chrome when used on PC2 is way way worse than Firefox, as in it gives me a lot of more ping. 

I apologize for my lack of knowledge, but I just had to ask, how is this supposed to work and can I fix it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find myself absolutely not caring about 99% of the skins in this game, but I would like simple colour choice. Like the mp5, I just wanted to be black or gray and I can only find those ridiculous skins and just a few good camos in offering. Also, the mp5 always keeps that disqusting orange magazine, so even if you change the skin it still looks stupid.

In general I am disappointed with customization in this game, I always assumed since the game is based on Free DLC + Microtransaction model, that there is a lot of choice for skins, but this is pretty meh. 

P.S.

In Battlefield 4, without the dlc you have an enormous amount of  choice for colour with which you can customize both weapons and vehicles, and they aren't even that hard to get.  </TEXT>

Dragon Dogma really pissed me off, common the game is out since 2011, and yes it is out on Steam since this January and yes it is not full priced, but still only 33% c'mon?!


Dark Souls 3 had a discount of 25% and I expected something between 10-20% so I am crazy happy about that.

	<TITLE> After W3(with DLC) I still don't understand the people and "critics" who haven't read the books (or even played the previous games) but praise the game to high heavens. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-21 16:20:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all, this text should be spoiler free, there is no major or maybe even minor revelations, if you think there are spoilers, please do tell.

To me saying the W3 is a perfect game and saying it has a good "story" and plot but not reading the books kind of seems shallow. Because honestly if I were to not read the books and start abruptly from W3 it would be like watching Civil War or Return of The King without seeing the previous movies or simply tuning in to last 20min of a movie. You don't know these characters enough, you can't say you  feel the bond or sadness or happiness when something happens to them because from your point of view they are almost strangers. It is writing 101, you cannot execute strong dramatic events with your main characters if you don't have the background for it, very simple. There has to be motivation, context, retrospective, something, anything.... to make all that work.



For example, when the first Civil War trailer came out, some people pointed out why does Tony Stark consider Steve Rodgers a friend. Regardless if there is an explanation for that or not, the point is certain interaction between characters does not work if it does not have appropriate background. 




So you simply can't convince me that Geralt's relation to Ciri, Yennefer or Dandellion is fleshed out and good writing if all you have is W3, its just not true, because W3 is the final act. It is the endgame, it is when these mostly "formed" characters begin to drive the plot, but if they aren't formed the plot wouldn't work. 



Another example,  saying B W has an amazing story but you don't know anything about the book character that appears there, it is simply ridiculous. Just telling the player they are "friends" is not enough to convince me. I mean yes the game does very good job of letting you know they ARE friends but you are at odds what kind of friendship it is or through what they went through. So some of those moments, they can't work, especially when they themselves(Geralt and the friend) nostalgically reminisce of past endeavors. 



Now yes there are AMAZING self contained stories inside W3, the Bloody Baron questline for example, I can't take away that from the game. So do note that I would still find the game good, at times even great, but it would never have a high untouchable spot like some people claim it has for them.  Witcher 3 plot to me without reading the books is an ice cream without a stick, a senseless blob melting away but still feels nice to lick at. 

Please if you don't agree try to understand, remember some good story beat from a piece of art that moved you emotionally and now imagine everything was erased just before that moment. It wouldn't feel the same would it? My point is Witcher 3 is the "the third act" a mostly very good third act, it has its flaws yes but overall great, but without the books and at least W2 it cannot be that good.


That's why I feel inner disgust when I see critics and youtubers  talking about plot and characters and writing, but when Witcher 3 comes out: 10/10 What an Amazing plot yadda yadda yadda(Looking at you Angry Joe).... I feel even more disgust when they haven't played the previous games not even W2 but that's another problem with the gaming press entirely... Though there were awesome people that understood they would be missing out without reading the books and playing the games (SuperBunnyHop) and didn't regret it.

	<DATE> 2016-06-08 22:27:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Through the randomness of the internetz I stumbled upon the image Sarkeesian posted on E3 in 2015  http://i.imgur.com/CgnPmSd.jpg

Before you start shredding me let me address some points please:

- I can't stand the Sarkeesian like the other guy, it is not about her, she just happens to be the source of the image

- Yes this was 2015 but nobody discussed this from the perspective I am going to argue(couldn't find it on reddit) and who's to say this is the last Soulsborne game?

- Its nothing about feminism or objectification, it is about DS brand and how it is perceived by the consumer/provider

My point is, if you are even remotely remotely familiar with DS does it seem to you like the series has ever appealed to anyone, on the regard of "sexy"? In the sense that somebody could be  swayed to buy a new Souls game because their genitals had an influence in it?

I'm sorry maybe it is elitism but I think that DS is kind of above this, its just not the type of brand that sells to shallow dumb chronic masturbators who find the appearance of a mediocre loser promoter girl enthralling, just because it happens that she wears DS3 on her shirt. I hardly think their is much crossover between Dead or Alive Volleyball  and DS consumer base. 

I mean in general I hate promoter babes or rather the people that in any shape or form fall for them(Your tits do not make the product better, end of story), but when you have an IP that is build around the idea of exploring, digging for more, research... that is usually accompanied by a very dour atmosphere that can conjure various not so mundane states in people like melancholy, apathy, the felling of bittersweet. When the aesthetics of its landscapes can seem unbelievably sterile or run down, like a sad dream. When as far as I know (haven't finished DS3) there is a single "sexualized" character(Gwyneverre) in the series and there is barely any mention of sex in the franchise(the Yharnam prostitute) or at least not in the conventional sense.

It really insults me that somebody thinks that Dark Souls fans would be somehow more inclined to buy the next tittle or promoting DS to a non fan via this... ugh....

Look I have nothing against sexy in video games (Eva in Metal Gear is one of my fav. characters in the series, I ADORE the Witcher games, I rolled my eyes at the whole Tracer ass thing... yadda,yadda) but there is a time, place and context for everything. 

Honestly, again maybe it is elitism but this fits CoD or if they did something cool with it I could see Borderlands doing this type of promotion really well, but Dark Souls for heaven's sake?!

https://youtu.be/ExP2chuO8Xc?t=50

If this conjures up the image of booth babes too you, then I hope you are the minority.... 

Then you have a large part of the community who are into (underage) anime girls, so in that sense wouldn't it have made sense to get some Asian girls with bright colored wigs and heavy makeup? That would least imply some awareness of the fanbase and the potential fanbase. 

Who is your favorite let's player, speedrunner or lore sage for DS, can you imagine them being swayed by tits to buy a DS game they have mixed feelings about? 

In conclusion, every fanbase has its shallow dumbass fans who fail to see the point of the IP in the first place, but I like to believe they don't have to be the majority. 

Now that I think about it, I can't even imagine a CoD player getting more interested in CoD because of tits, not if the rpm of a gun is broken or quick scoping is out or whatever...  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So I beat the Fume Knight in less than 10 tries... SoTFS </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-08 20:30:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before playing SoTFS I finished DS, DS1 and Bloodborne with all their content, so yes I consider myself a PvE vet in soulsborne. 

And just like the flamelurker, the Fume Knight was a disappointment, don't get me wrong they are both GREAT boss fights, I really enjoyed them. But I feel that sometimes that the hype and the rep. on the internetz can so over blow the difficulty of a boss. Case in point, I helped players out who summoned 4-6 summons every time, I mean that is some ridiculous fear. 

Of course I wouldn't dare fight him NG7+ or something but then again, here's the thing with him and why I didn't understand the hype, quite early in the fight, I managed to memorize his animations and respond accordingly, so even if you would pump him up with more stats you would just make the boss fight more, frustrating? Not difficult, in theory it would just take me more time. It would never make me think I can't actually beat him. 

What I am trying to say is, if I can immediately see how to beat the boss then I don't understand how can it how such a fearsome reputation, because I am by no means some speedrunner pr0. 


In the case of, for example Ornstein and Smough, I understand their reputation because they are so overwhelming as a dynamic duo in the beginning and there is more "random" factor in their fight or Vicar Amelia who's moves are harder to read and has her own healing which not every player can counter. 

I guess the part of his reputation is that there a lot of dumbies who even by that point of the game still don't figure out that Ashen Shrines mean trouble and that you should probably kill them because they heal the f-in boss.

EDIT: I remembered that recently I played with a friend against Artorias, the second DS1 run for me, and the only reason we beat him around 10 tries, was because we were way overleveled, we kind of bruteforced it. But even he felt harder then the Fume Knight, even in Co-Op. He simply felt more unpredictable and didn't seem that easy to dodge or avoid. 

P.S. Everything I said for the Fume Knight goes for the Smelter Demon too. And I just realized I started my post in very Donald Trump way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just entered the Dragon Aerie, and was amazed by the visuals and the atmosphere, and just when I was about to explore it, these corpses that explode acid start to attack me and in the process ruin my equipment. 

Now, maybe this is just me but first of all, they feel really out of place for me, it's just not what I have in mind when I see mountains with dragons. Then their concept alone...

The people that designed must have a strange dislike to the player having fun and overcoming obstacles, because these scum are a pure nuisance or pest, they are a threat to your equipment and not your life, they constantly force you to play a very dull playstyle and if your equipment gets destroyed, guess what? Off to the smiths with you. I have played most of Soulsborne games, and I think I can honestly tell this is one of the worst experiences in the franchise that I ever had.

There is no clever challenge behind this, this just disgusting disregard for the player's experience. I've heard that DS2 is the worst, by far the least imaginative and the most wanna be edgy hard game in the Soulsborne, yet still this went above and beyond of all my expectations...

P.S. I can tell you one thing for sure, I would take getting killed for weeks by Ornstein   Smough any day over  having to spend another minute with those stupid creatures.  </TEXT>

Wisenland is in war with Vampire Counts, there is a Waaargh coming from the south, a vampire rebellion in one of their provinces. What do they do? They declare war of course, to Hochland who's ally is none other then the Empire the faction that goes from 1-3 in strength ranking..... 

What does CA do when they develop these games I often wonder. In fact I often wonder do they even play them, so when things like this happen, shouldn't they get mad and give their best to fix them?

	<TEXT> Does this happen to console users? What I mean is namely, when you enter an area being human you start getting "aimed" for invasions, however this prevents you from seeing signs (they come on and off)which I don't understand why, seeing as you can summon other people during invasion. You are also completely prevented from doing your own invasion.

Then guess what? No invasion occurs for long stretches of time! I wouldn't mind this if invasions actually came, but this way the game kind of cripples you for no real reason, you have to exit to the menu and re-load just so you could go back to the bonfire or bring back some of the signs. 

Oh and even if you do menage to see the signs and initiate summons, it is the mostly likely time you will get failed summon. 

So far this is second only to cheaters and backstab whores when it comes to dark souls MP experience.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I basically need a bluetooth device, so the Wi Fi aspect is not that important to me (but I can find uses) and 
I am at odds when picking one of these two. Some say the adapters all get broken within weeks or months, some say that is totally uncalled for. Adapters also seem to have vastly inferior range and input lag compared to the cards.  





My logic is, why buy an expensive bluetooth adapter that might die off sooner or later when I can buy a PCI card that will most likely have a longer life, at least that is what people are telling me, and I get a wifi connection too. 




But for the cards, what is it exactly that I need, if I buy a Gigabyte card, does that mean I have to have a gigabyte motherboard or if I buy an Intel card, does that mean I have to own a Intel processor? 


And is there something else I am missing? 

A lot of people suggested Kinivo BTD-400 Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter and the Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Although I play 95% of games with the kb+m, sometimes even the might of the PC is not enough to help. So I need dualshocks, and finding them is not a problem, but the bluetooth adapters confuse me. 

I have no idea how to check these features:

- How long is their range?

- How long will they last without malfunctions?

- Will they have any input lag?

- When are they overpriced? 

- How to fix one if they malfunction, or is it even worth the bother?

- Is one Adapter enough for several controllers?

EDIT: 
- morriscey suggested PCI wifi/bluetooth chip and advice on that? They seem to be vastly superior and not that expensive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have bought charging cables that cost more than 15 euros yet still last for less than 6 months, and since then I am really getting frustrated about the whole issue. 

I wish I could somehow "fix" them or somehow prevent their malfunction.

But I encounter several problems there:

- I do not treat them in any special hazardous way, they just stand in one place and charge whatever I need to charge.

- I do not know even where to begin when they stop working, because I honestly couldn't tell you why they stopped. A lot of them just "stop", there isn't any special reason or suspicion I could give you.

- Even if I possessed the knowledge of why they are not working, how would I begin to fix them? "What" is there to be fixed, especially when we are talking about 3m cables!

	<TITLE> Would you consider this a pretty sweet deal for a Dark Souls remaster? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-06 03:10:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think it goes without saying that a lot of people would like to play Dark Souls well after DS3 release, but unfortunately it is stuck on last-gen consoles and the PC port is broken and full of cheaters. 
So why wouldn't Namco and FS want to sell us a remaster and with a bonus trilogy edition? A lot of stuff that I say probably can go for Demon's Souls too. 

So here is a list of features that I think nobody would have a problem with and would allow the game to sell at a price above 40 euros or dollars:
1. Upgrade to 60 FPS

2. Texture Upgrade - PC mods have shown this is really to achieve and it barely affects performance, so FS could even go further than those mods

3. Effective anti-cheat system

4. Adding or finishing as much of "unreleased content" as possible, to a lot of people it is obvious DS was rushed, what I am basically saying is, why not try the "finished version" now?

5. Improved functional PC port, with THE SAME mod opportunities

6. Item re-balance. A lot of people think it doesn't make much sense and that it is rather underwhelming when you defeat an epic boss, forge its weapon/armor and find out it is mediocre. So make those items one of the strongest and worth the actual effort. It really shouldn't be "debatable" are they any good. 

7. A new model for the Stray and Firesage Demons, seriously they feel so cheap. 

8. Remove the annoying mosquitoes in Blightown 

9. Make Gold Pine Resin available to buy with vendors.

10. Magic Shield magic should last longer, Undead Rapport should be more "useful" and some other abilities.
EDIT:

11. Hire Durante and Wulf2k - Might as well pay them if your not gonna do the work yourself  

Now here are some controversial suggestions:
-Remove the skeleton reassembly Catacombs mechanic, so far the only thing they accomplish is that many players simply avoid them until they get stupid strong or they are rushed without giving the player the opportunity to experience them truly.

-Remove or update parry/backstab  system, I mean this was done in future games so why not fix it here to? Fact of the matter is not only can it horribly destroy PvP but PvE too. I am so sick of seeing a let's player just parry-ing all enemies, there is no strategy or thought behind its simple reflex and muscle memory, which makes a lot of fights boring. 

-Perhaps remove the curse mechanic entirely? It really serves as an occasional annoyance and it slows your progress, nothing really interesting or challenging about it.

-RedEyeOrb or should be available earlier and with lesser cost, or make the CrackedEyeOrb easier to buy and without much cost in the game campaign (Not having to lose Frampt). Again (some) future Soulsborne game did this. Because why remove a huge feature of this game for a lot of players? How many first time players are likely to beat Four Kings before Queelag?

-Perhaps make Pyromancy its own thing? So it is a path on its own like magic, right now anybody can use power within, great combustion and firestorm. It can feel a bit OP. 

-More Warp locations, notably give one for Blightown. 

-A bonfire in New Londo Ruins

	<TITLE> I think finishing Dark Souls and Bloodborne first may have slightly damaged my Demon's Souls experience. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-28 03:00:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let me just say that I mostly enjoyed Demon's Souls and thought the ending was brutally good among other things, so there are many things I could praise this game for and they will, but not today. 

Playing the two games previously made me kinda too familiar with game mechanics and even some specific assets. 

I hope you will be able to understand this, but I felt kinda "underwhelmed" when I beat 6 bosses in a row without dying. The infamous Firelurker took me two tries, and I never quite understood why is he so problematic for other players. 

I missed that feeling of tension and excitement when fighting a boss and the incredible sense of achievement when you beat him.
Let me give you an example, the Fool's Idol boss, before the boss fight I encountered the NPC that looked as if he observes a boss fight area, the player hints confirmed to me that I should probably kill him. Anyway, the boss fight starts and my only weapon gets damaged, feeling lazy I take my 6+ Compound bow and kill it, barely losing health and not much of arrows. 
EDIT: As a matter of fact, it is the same exact way I killed the Storm King! I didn't know anything about him when I came in, so just halfassedly tried to beat him and the flying enemies with the bow and arrows I had at hand, and I did it!!! 

It kind of felt "stale", like a boss fight should not be so mundane in a Souls game. 

Anyway, my opinion is that after I killed the Flamelurker and the Old Hero, my character got a bit too strong. Something similar happens in Dark Souls(Pinwheel for example) but it doesn't impact your game so negatively.

Another thing that I felt was frustrating and has no excuse is the over complicated weapon upgrade system and the weight system. There is just way too many shards and chunks, and weapon upgrade paths, and the requirements for those upgrades. And then of course all those upgrade materials over encumbering you...

Now this might be a nitpick, but I used one weapon for 95% of my gameplay, the Winged Spear. It had the best scaling(I didn't find a single weapon with better scaling) and since the shards are so annoying and complicated, I decided it's not worth the bother with trying out to upgrade other weapons. As it turns out I was right since I didn't much time to finish the game, and I would have wasted time hunting down those crystal  lizards over and over again.  

Then there was the world tendency... I just have no words for it, I don't know it seemed like a over complicated and over elaborate system that made you miss a significant amount of content. 

I also felt a little bit disappointed in  FS, since they re-used so many assets in later games(Animations, Models, Sounds, Mechanics...). At a certain point it seems like laziness, I mean I don't want to play a game and say: "oh the obligatory poison lvl", "oh the guy throwing flame bombs in a tight spot","oh the nice lady NPC","oh the annoying platforming section which is a big hole" etc... 


Basically I can't shake of the feeling that Demon's Souls would have been a fantastic experience had I played it before any other Souls game and From Software aren't the game developer gods that a lot of people make them out to be. 

P.S. I was never invaded nor I managed to invade anybody else, I wonder why is that so? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So am I insane, or is fighting O S incredibly fun!? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-16 05:13:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I try to enjoy boss fights in all games, and the same goes for DS. So when I fought O S on my first playthrough it was mildly fun, but it quickly turned it boredom and tedium and then it evolved into weird apathy.

However on my second playthrough after playing other SoulsBorne games I decided to re-play DS but with a wildly different character, a dexterity-intelligence spell warrior, and guess what I am having a blast with O S. 

It reminded me a little on the fight with Gehrman, because it can  turn into a deadly dance and that is awesome. This is the fun part of being challenged, because you can't slip up when Smough raises the hammer and Ornstein is lurking from the flank. So when you dodge their hits and menage to give out damage you feel like such a goddamn badass! And when they make mince meat out of you, it is on you not on the game - usually. 

A person was watching one of these clashes of mine, and got incredibly excited. So when I killed Smough the person was like "YEAH, F-you fatboy, now you only got the skinny one left" and as if Ornstein heard that when he transformed he pierced me with one hit and electrified me and was like "Bitch, I'm just getting warmed up" and then he threw me away like a used condom. 

Anyway that's one of the reasons I love Dark Souls, since you can have these Epic fights that even if you lose still leave you with a sense of excitement and want. It is one of my biggest gripes with the game, since I wish I could fight any boss fight at my will (after I defeat them) not go through the whole damn game again.

I also look forward fighting Artorias and Kalameet, I remember they were incredibly fun and hard at the same time, especially Artorias. So please write what fights do you love fighting and don't mind losing!?

P.S. I think the reason why I am having more fun this time in this fight is a more agile character and I developed more confidence and skill with dodging. With my tank character I had way more fight with some brute bosses like Iron Golem. When he hit me the first time and took a splinter of my health I was like Thor in The Dark World " Funny, I thought for a such big guy you would hit harder *switches to grass-crest shield, two hands weapon*". </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does it make sense lore wise for all the enemies to be mute? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-06 01:59:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You know I love Dark Souls, lore   story background including, I love its cold melancholic atmosphere. But whenever I read up on the lore, I remember that not every enemy is an animal or hollow, and it really starts to aggravate me a little that 99% of bosses do not "speak" anything - Gwyndolin is the only one as far as I know. 

For example, look at Quelaag, why is it so hard for her to say anything, she seems to be able to feel compassion and has the ability to speak, I just find it odd that she wouldn't give you a warning or question your intents? 

Or Seath, dear god, if there was ever a character in DS who is criminally damaged by being silent! I mean he captures you, that opens opportunities for dialogue, he could reveal so much interesting information and raise even more interesting questions. He even seems like a stereotypical villain, the one that would gloat and give long monologues, I am not saying he should do that, but that he has background that suggests he is like that. But surely a curious person as he is, there would be things he would be curious about, I mean you might have even time traveled and defeated the Abyss, I'm sure he would find that interesting one way or another.

Of course there is other examples, but for now I focused on these, to give you a rough idea. 

Look I enjoyed dark souls low exposition approach , and I still do but there comes a CERTAIN time when it feels out of character for some figures in the story to be completely mute which in turn is immersion breaking and makes the story thinner. When I first played DS I kind of assumed that all these enemies went completely insane or lost their consciousness, so I when I found out that is not the case, that in fact some characters from what we can tell seem to be very rich and colorful personalities, well then I thought we are at loss and that the authors are maybe not that creative or really didn't think all of it through. 

It makes me feel how pointless the name of the boss is or he's/she's/its music, because in the end despite having rich character backgrounds they still seem like hollow models that are just trying to violently murder you.... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> DS fan but the thing(s) I still hate from day one... (platforming sections) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-01 03:00:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A little background, I love DS and I have played every game in Souls series, not finished but played, I would have finished all of them if RL circumstances allowed me to.  So I am what a lot of people would consider  a fan. 

Yet, from the very first instance of encountering this in the game I hated it,  the "platforming". I hate any goddamn section in this game that forces me to time my rolls and jumps on some intricate landscape.
It simply feels out of the place, the game shines when you explore and in combat, because it is clearly designed around that, but not around platforming. The platforming feels so clunky,  INCREDIBLY clunky and unreliable. So it is really not the game's strength. In fact I dare you to find anyone praising DS for the incredibly "fun" part in Blightown wheel or The Great Hollow! 

The game's reputation  is built around mystery, discreet interesting mechanics, exciting boss battles and the brutal punishment. But not for it's clunky "jumping" and "rolling". 

So I really really really hope DS3 won't have any of it. It kind of reminds me on some horrible "hacking" sections in games that have not been build around it, it just takes out off the awesome gameplay to do some stupid clunky chore the game wasn't even made for and without which the game could work perfectly.  

So is there some other gripe you have from day one? Please share, but please refrain from issues that all games might have (balancing, technical issues etc..) </TEXT>

Yet at the and of my first play I also used the BKG a lot, it just looks soooo cool and hits hard. As I understand it is really hard to farm it early on, since only one dark knight has it and it's in the catacombs which means until get a divine weapon it is out of access. 

I want to have a hard hitting knight build, sort of roleplay in elite knight armor.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had someone tampering with my registry, and since then I cannot play mtw2 mods. Basically the .bat file starts but the kingdoms.exe doesn't start, so I can play vanilla expansions but no mods, unless they overwrite the vanilla files. 



Even after I completely fixed my registry the mods won't start, I also reinstalled steam and mtw2 several times. 

It is important to note that I was playing mods regularly before that registry issue. I also tried doing the old way, with a shortcut of kingdoms.exe for example:
--features.mod=mods/americas

I've also added lines like that into the launch options, and the only result was the mod loading screen when I pick medieval 2 vanilla, but never with the expansions. 

EDIT: Something else was broken in my registry, so I was on the right way with the launch line options.

SOLUTION:
You have to add this the line in the LAUNCH options: 

--features.mod=mods/ *insert mod folder name here*

 Or the alternative Thanks to Damavikoff (steam user) --features.mod=mods/ *insert mod folder name here* @mods *insert mod folder name here* \ *insert the name of the cfg file in your mod folder here*

However I've gotta note that the core of this problem is steam, and I cannot explain how I discovered that.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For a bit less than a year I had this problem, but at first it was only when I played demanding games. Then it went to mediocre games and now if I am just browsing the internet.

The fans don't work and when the graphics card heats up to 80 they work like crazy. Before that they had a set minimum and the GPU never over heated. However for the life of me I can't figure out when did they started to work differently.

At first I thought the GPU was dirty, but after a thorough  clean up and observation it is definitely something to do with software. I deleted MSI Afterburner, "reset-ed" Bios to default and re-installed my GPU drivers. But it is still the same. I'd rather not have to download some third party software to set a manual speed, I simply want my GPU do to it alone as it did when I bought the damn thing, that means it worked on a small speed (I mean the fans) and if need be it increased the RPM, but that was never necessary.

AMD Global drive shows that my fan is working bellow 80% and that it gradually it increases as the temp does, but I am looking at the fans and they are simply not spinning!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am trying to play with the infiltrator class and cqc people. 
But I am encountering a lots of things that make wanna quit the whole thing and play a generic third person shooter with the Enforcer.

1)The enemy can still shoot me even though I initiate a takedown animation. - Is that some kind of skill you unlock later on?

2)Even when I  menage to takedown one person, somebody else shoots me down, ok fair enough, BUT you don't get any points for the takedown, which is RIDICULOUS considering how hard it is to accomplish.  

3)Some enemies that I takedown, instantly recover and kill me with ease(I am using a non lethal pistol only). - Again, is this some kind of unlockable skill? 

4)Some enemies I capture for interrogation, when I press Q which activates the communication radio and my character releases them and again, they kill me. 

All in All my impression of the infiltrator class is that it's broken. You are either a overpowered stealth covered shit mowing down enemies, or if you really try to play "STEALTH" you get destroyed. Again my biggest frustration with this whole thing is that the takedown isn't counted in your score like an assist for example, since it's really hard to pull off.

I really don't want to talk about this at the official Firefox "support forums", they are just comically inept and incapable of any help, 90% problems I had with Firefox, I solved them by visiting other sites.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, you know the remembering where you left of feature, well all or most of youtube links "disappear" when I restart Firefox.

	<TITLE> [Light Spoilers]Have you ever tried to bring the wandering puppets to the "normal" guards? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I tried bringing guards next to the Puppets that are knocked out or awake, and I also tried bringing puppets to guard posts.

Every single time, it's kind of anti climatic, guards fall unconscious and cannot be awaken, sometimes even after I kill all the puppets. 

To be honest, that kind of disappointed me, and it really shows how little "open" this open world is, in other games you can sometimes see factions fighting but not here (no Mujaheddin or UNITAvsMPLA). 

P.S. That also never happens in Witcher 3 whose "open world" is also rather mediocre, but it can be "forced".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted to go in guns blazing with my chopper on that Airfield in Angola, I figured I might as well have some fun and actually use 80% of weapons and gadgets. 

But no , so far it's impossible, even a smoke artillery bombardment and chaff bombardment do not stop the tank, he almost always hits the chopper. And it's not some lucky shot, it takes him three shots to take the chopper down, and he always takes it down before I land. 

P.S. It's really stupid that you have to wait for the chopper to fly down on the exact LZ. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have searched and searched but I can't find any solution for this. Since everybody keeps saying "offline" this and that, but I don't want to go offline, that means you loose a HUGE amount of resources and they get capped! 

So far the only thing I can think of is make the FOB as shitty as possible and unattractive/ But still if it gets attacked it means I will lose resources and men from motherbase?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do the guard alerts and checkpoints work? They seem broken to me. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> EDIT:
I am now 100% sure Guards get more alert after you re-load to a checkpoint, there is no way anybody can convince me otherwise.

I was seeking up in grass to a group of enemies, there was a sniper directly in front of me, his distance was about 50-70m. Before engaging him I spotted all other enemies. Using NVG, I forgot about helmets, and I hit his helmet two times before I tranq'd him with my silence sniper. Anyway, after that I screwed up and had to reload.

Now, I come to the same position, he notices me almost immediately and shots only seconds after Ocelot's sniper hint. 

Third time, I sneak upon him from his side, somewhere around 4-5 meters, he suddenly turns and again starts firing like seconds after he sees me. In all the cases I was prone and in grass.  </TEXT>
