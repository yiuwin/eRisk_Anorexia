	<TEXT> I started restricting last Monday (March 21) after not restricting for well over a year. I was on spring break last week so it was quite easy. I wasn't hungry nor did I have any cravings. I've lost 3.6 pounds since the 21st. I'm hoping by the end of this week I'll be 120.

Classes started back up today and I'm *absolutely ravenous*. I've had 424 calories today, which is good, but I'm hungry. I'll have tea soon after I post this to hold me over until I go to sleep. Tomorrow is my long day with 3 classes. I'm on campus from 10am to 3:45pm. I'll drink 2 cups of coffee before I leave and pack 2 cups of yogurt to have when I inevitably get hungry. I have some Adderall left from my old prescription. I'm debating whether or not I want to take some tomorrow.

My mom and her boyfriend will be visiting on April 6th until the 10th to watch me in my horse riding competition. I'm really worried about eating when they're here. They are planning on going out to eat every night (I live in Vegas, so naturally they want to try all the restaurants here). If I didn't have a horse riding competition, it would be easy to fast all day then just pick at lean meats and veggies while we're at a restaurant. But I can't exactly fast while I'm actively competing. So I'll either end up fasting and being weak/risk injuring myself or my horse, or just eating way more food than I'd ever imagine and being super depressed with the weight gain when they leave :/

Before I knew they'd be visiting, I was planning to just eat 500-600 calories in the morning before I compete and fast the rest of the day. But that's not feasible if we'll be going out to eat afterwards.

Any ideas as to how I can make their visit as painless as possible, food wise?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing about these body image issues is I feel like I'm never going to get to a point where I'm happy. I'm probably a size 32-34 in most breeches right now, and I feel like even when/if I get down to a 26 or smaller I'm still going to be unhappy with my thighs in the saddle.

That's the problem with eating disorders unfortunately :( Looking back at when I weighed 111 (my lowest adult weight), I felt like I looked how I look now at 123. Body dysmorphia is a bitch and as much as we all hate to admit it, eating disorders are about *so much more* than just being thin. I could be 20 pounds lower than my goal weight and still not feel thin enough. 

And I think you had mentioned on a previous post about IHSA. How is Western Equitation? When I started riding, I rode Western but switched to English because jumping looked cool. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh I love Warmbloods as well. I have a TB who's 15.2hh and he's the perfect size for me. Everyone thinks he's 16hh+ because I'm small and make him look bigger than he is. I think the tallest I'd ever be able to ride is 16.1hh because I cannot imagine being able to wrap my legs around anything bigger. Even with my TB, I wear spurs and it still takes a LOT of leg to get him going. What level dressage do you do? I primarily jump but I have done a bit of dressage (showed intro level, schooled training level). I'd love to do more but my horse can only go up to 1st level and I think I love jumping too much. 

UGH SAME WITH MY THIGHS IN PICTURES! Of course people love to take pictures of horse + rider from the side, with ribbons hanging from the side of the bridle. I feel like my thighs spread out sooo much and I just look disgusting :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep I do hunters and equitation which is judged 100% subjectively. GM is an ass. IIRC he said "the best exercise a rider can get is to push away from the dinner table". I'm a size 26 in breeches but I am only 5"1 so I definitely carry my weight differently. I'm going to have to aim towards wearing child sized breeches if I want to look like one of those dainty equitation princesses, or just get a bigger horse :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess hard candies would help but imo if you are prone to fainting, it might be safer to just restrict really low cal. 

To distract myself from hunger I just drink coffee. Lots and lots of coffee. I'll have tea if I'm hungry closer to bedtime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Forget beach body. For me, it's all about that *breech* body. I'm a competitive equestrian athlete and the ideal look for a rider is tall with long, skinny legs and thighs, as well as a small slim waist. I'm 5"1 so to look like that I have to be super super skinny. Which is what I'm working on. I *need* my thighs to look long and slim in breeches. My biggest fear, however, is that I'll lose a lot of muscle mass. But I guess I can't have my cake and eat it, too ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been restricting all week, after over a year of no real restriction. Some nights, it's hard to fall asleep. I'm familiar with this since I remember having many insomniac nights when I'd restrict in the past. But most nights, I'm able to fall asleep pretty quickly, and I find that my body naturally wakes me up earlier. I typically set my alarm to go off between 7:45am and 8:15am. The past few mornings, I've been waking up 45-60 minutes earlier for no real reason other than just...waking up. I usually go to bed between 10pm and 11pm, but last night it was midnight. I thought "great, I'm going to bed late and I'm not going to be able to wake up early and be productive." But I did wake up earlier without my alarm. 

Is there any science behind this? Is this common with restriction? </TEXT>

"Real" thinspo (to me at least) is pictures of someone who clearly starved themselves to get their current physique because that's what I'm doing. So it seems more realistic in a way. Blah I sound like a damn sociopath.  </TEXT>

While raspberries are healthy and safe, I'd rather eat a measly 3oz compared to an entire pint, because then I can eat other things and have variety every day since I allow myself so few calories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This, too. When I was recovered, I would meal prep my dinners and lunches. When I was trying to lose weight the healthy way, I did the same but obviously being very strict with weighing and measuring everything. Now, I don't really eat meals, but I portion everything out. I bought a big bag of Skinny Pop so I weigh 28g of it and put it into baggies. I do the same with fruits and veggies. All into individual 3 oz portions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's much easier to avoid eating when you're the one who has 100% control of what food is brought (or not brought) into the house. If there's junk food in my pantry, I can throw it away. No one knows if I've had dinner or not. I don't have to fake having dirty dishes in the sink. No one else is around to cook and make temping food/ask me to have some. 

I can have nothing but bottled water, almond milk, fruits, veggies and cheese in the fridge and **no one** gets to comment on it. 

It's so much easier to restrict when there's no one monitoring you, and when you have a kitchen full of safe foods only. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm an athlete so working out is supplemental to my sport. However, I can only really go to the gym if I'm eating 700-900 calories a day, otherwise I'm too tired. 700+ is personally a bit too high for me and gives me anxiety so I'd rather just be eating 300-550 doing minimal exercise (riding my horse/sports practice). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, eating crap food prior to heavily restricting/fasting kind of helps. Maybe it'll help you? Last Sunday my friends and I went for pizza and I was *so full* and gross and bloated, I was looking forward to "cleansing" myself in a way all week this week. This whole week has been a breeze and I'm sooo ready to continue this week. I would suggest going to the grocery store and buying lots of low cal/safe foods for yourself for this coming week to make restricting easier for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No I totally get you. I've been super suicidal before, I know what "everyone would be better off without me" feels like. And it's not true! No one would be better off without you. Based on what you've described regarding your family, they seem to love you (especially your dad planning meals and stuff). 

I went to a therapeutic boarding school but about a month/month and a half before that I was in a child psych ward for 2 weeks because I had a suicide attempt. Both experiences are very different from what I understand IP to be like. I'm guessing IP is just like therapeutic boarding school but without the school portion. 

Basically when I was in therapeutic boarding school, we had our normal school days. But in the morning (weekdays) we would have group therapy, therapy with a therapist once or twice a week, then another more personal group therapy 1 night a week. The staff there were trained to deal with mental illnesses. Everyone from the custodial staff to the front desk lady. People were super supportive. 

We didn't have access to cell phones or the Internet. We could use the Internet but only in the computer lab for school stuff, which was monitored. No social media or email. So we could only use snail mail to hear from our family and friends. Our parents could also email our therapists letters to us. We could have 1-2 monitored phone calls to our parents per week as well. We also got monthly visits. My first 2 months, family had to come and visit me. After that, I was allowed 1 home visit per month.

I don't think you need to qualify for it really? I mean you are obviously suicidal so you're an ideal "candidate" for IP, but other than that, I don't know what other criteria they would have. You can be high functioning but still severely ill. I was still able to do my school work, bathe and eat, but I was depressed, harming myself all the time. 

Definitely talk to your psychiatrist about this. If they knew how you felt right now, I'm sure they'd also suggest IP. 

Best of luck with everything. We are all here for you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know you don't want to waste your tuition money but I think IP would be the best option for you right now. When I was in high school, I went to a therapeutic boarding school for 1 year that saved my life. It was something like $6,500 a month and my parents had to use majority of my college fund for it (up to my neck in student loans right now) and I gained a ton of weight there but it saved my life. 

I may be miserable every now and then but I wouldn't be alive right now if it weren't for the fact I sought treatment (albeit against my will) 6 years ago. I'm glad I'm alive. Please get the help you need. We love you here and we want you to be happy 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started restricting this week after several weeks of discouragingly trying to lose weight the healthy way. I "recovered" from anorexia then ended up gaining a ton of weight back. Anyways, this is my first time *really* restricting in over a year probably. 

I've lost 2.4 pounds since Monday and I feel amazing (I think I've lost more but my period is causing me to retain a lot of water weight). Restricting has become so easy. This is my first period of "long term" restricting since I bought my horse in October 2014. I had a lesson today and my trainer was beyond impressed with my riding. She was speechless. 

Honestly, I was worried about riding today because I was pretty dizzy when I woke up this morning. I don't know if losing weight has made my riding better or the confidence *from* losing weight is making me perform better in the saddle. Whatever it is, I'm feeling super super super awesome. I have a horse riding competition in 2 weeks and hopefully I can keep up this momentum. 

Bah! Just wanted to share some positivity with you all and give you all a huge thanks for being such an awesome community.  </TEXT>

1 cup fruit (usually strawberries or blueberries): 50-85 cals

1 scoop protein powder: 120 cal

1 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk: 30

If I have this, I usually have this for breakfast, skip lunch then have a 200 cal max dinner. It's quite filling with the added protein powder so I don't get hungry for at least 4 hours. </TEXT>

I might add a snack but I don't know. I'm feeling really discouraged from the lack of weight loss due to my period so I'll probably skip it. I usually don't count my coffee in my daily calories since it's only 30 calories but since I had 4 cups instead of 1, I'm counting it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so I literally just got my period. That's probably what's causing the scale to stay the same, rather than 1-2 cups of soup a day. Although I'm sure the sodium isn't helping my case :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really tasty! If I'm eating before going riding, I'll add a bagel thin (100 cal) or a sandwich thin (90) so the carbs give me an extra boost of energy and even with that it's only 134 or 124 cals! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only fruit I buy are strawberries, raspberries and blueberries since they are really low cal. As much as I love apples, pears and bananas, they're too high calorie for me. 120 cal for a banana? I could have 2 egg whites + a sandwich thin for 124 calories instead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been restricting to 500-700 calories a day this week and the scale hasn't budged! I know 100% it's because I've been eating soup for dinner every night (I hate that soup is so low cal but soooo high in sodium) and the sodium is causing me to retain a ton of water weight. 

I look and feel much thinner, so I've clearly lost some weight. I'm going to avoid soup today (even though that's the only "dinner" food I have at home) and probably restrict to less than 300 today. 

Hopefully tomorrow morning the scale has budged since I'd have consumed less sodium today. </TEXT>

But she doesn't want to do anything about her weight/go back to her old weight. She says she's happy with her body right now. I mean, good for her! Being happy and comfortable in her own skin. I could never imagine being comfortable in my own skin. Even if I got down to my GW. But vanity isn't everything. I really do worry about her health due to her weight and eating habits.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah when I was in high school my friends would always always always want to go to fast food restaurants on the weekends, at lunch or after school. After a while, they started getting super suspicious of me never eating when we went out. So every once in a while I would order something small and eat a bite every few minutes. By the time they were done with their food, I'd only be like 4 bites into whatever I ordered so it wasn't that bad in term of extra calories. 

I have a friend like that right now, and as horrible as it sounds, I've been avoiding social interaction with her. I hate myself for it because she's a really good friend! But she's just 2 inches taller than me and at least 25 pounds heavier, and she always wants to get burgers or something like that. She thinks my ED is in the past, so if I avoid food with her, she thinks I'm engaging in ED behaviors again and lectures me. So I either have to eat around her or avoid her all together :/ I miss her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in high school when my ED started and I had weekly weigh ins. I would wear lots of layers. 2 pairs of underwear, 2 pairs of socks, a regular bra and sports bra, a long sleeved t-shirt under my sweater, 2 tank tops under that. I was always cold so I would also wear those heat patches that wrap around your torso when I'd get weighed. 

Also, maybe the night before your weigh in, have a soup that's really high in sodium? That way, you can still restrict but the sodium from the soup will make you retain water weight (even though you really lost weight from restriction). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't weighed myself in a few weeks. But I've been eating at a deficit (1200 cals a day). This week I've been sticking to 400-600 a day and I'll weigh myself on Sunday. Even though I know I should be losing weight eating 400-600 cals a day, I have a huge irrational fear that I either haven't lost any weight or gained some weight.

I think the best thing to do is just weigh yourself daily so you get more desensitized to it. I recall weighing myself even the day following a binge or eating crap all day. I need to get back to that point cos it's the only thing that helps me stay on track even if I see +2 pounds in the morning.  </TEXT>

I vape (former smoker, finally off nicotine all together) so a lot of my e-liquids are donut/cookie/custard flavor which makes me pretty much never crave sweets.

	<TEXT> Life has been pretty okay. I'm on spring break now and am taking this time to restrict as much as I can since it's harder to restrict when I'm in school. 

I have a horse riding competition the weekend of April 8 and my mom will be coming from out of town to watch! I'm really excited to compete in April - I haven't competed since November and I really miss showing. I'm trying to be 120 by then (I think I'm 127 right now) which is totally doable. My only fear is that my show coat will be too big on me and I might have to buy a new one. 

The weekend after that I'm going to Washington DC with my mom. I'm worried about this because I'll be staying in a hotel, etc, and it'll be harder to restrict.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't used protein shakes as a way of coming off a fast but I will say that they really aren't difficult to measure out/mix. You just fill a scoop (provided with the powder) with the powder and that's a serving size. You can mix the powder with water or any other liquid really. I prefer unsweetened vanilla almond milk since it's only 30 cals per 8 oz. That brings my shake total to 150 and I find it to be a really filling "meal" for the amount of calories it is. Just my two cents. 

Overall, I think it would be beneficial to use protein shakes as well as take multivitamins to come off a fast. It will replenish your body with nutrients and prepare it for solid foods.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I went to the horsey store/tack shop to order some competition breeches. They were having a 50% off sale and these breeches I couldn't find in my size online were on sale at the store! In my size! So I bought them! 

They're a size 26 (aka size 4) and they're a bit too snug on me :( I mean, when I'd comfortably fit a size 26 I was about 5-10 pounds lighter so it makes sense. Honestly they're only tight around the hips - if I lost 1 inch at my hips they'd be *perfect*.

I was sad that they're tight on me BUT this gives me more motivation to keep on doing what I'm doing. I was *going* to eat 700 calories instead of 500 today but this has given me a good reason NOT to eat the extra 200 calories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had 500 calories today. This is my first time restricting since probably August or September so I'm glad it went well. What helped me the most was eating 4 times today, drinking **lots** of water and having a cup of tea after dinner. I don't feel hungry or tired, nor do I have any cravings. 

I went to the supermarket and bought tons of low cal/safe foods for me to eat for the rest of the week. 

I was pretty sedentary today so we'll see how tomorrow goes since I plan on riding my horse and going to the gym afterwards. 

Hope you're all well! </TEXT>

Just yesterday, I was watching a video of me riding my horse when I first bought him. I was no more than 10-15 pounds lighter then but I look *so much* skinnier.

	<TEXT> I know, same! I don't know about you, but I find that the less I think about food, the less I eat? I've unintentionally lost a lot of weight in the past simply because I wasn't thinking about food and eating like 1 meal a day. A normal to even *large* meal, but I still lost a lot of weight. It's so frustrating being able to lose weight like that, then when you try to restrict, it's an uphill battle. 

Good luck with your fast, be safe!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly fasting is not worth it. In my opinion it's better to just restrict low-cal rather than consuming nothing. I don't think I'd ever do a fast again for more than 24 hours to "detox" myself after 2+ days of heavy eating. But I will say that *not* thinking about the fact I was fasting while I was fasting helped a lot - if that makes sense :3

	<TEXT> I just got back from dropping my cousin off at the airport. She arrived Friday morning. She's a major foodie and I live in Vegas so naturally she wanted to eat out *all* the time. Seriously, we ate at restaurants for 2 meals **everyday**. She paid for everything, which was nice, but I feel so disgusting and huge!

Anyways, I'm on spring break for the next week and I've decided to do low cal restricting (300-500 cals/day) compared to the high cal restricting (600-800) I do when I have school. 

I haven't done low cal restricting for a while so it'll take some getting used to. So tomorrow, I plan on having protein shakes (150 cal each) in place of meals. 120 for the powder and 30 for a cup of almond milk to mix with. Oh, and a cup of coffee with a bit of cream in the morning. That'll be a little less than 500 calories in total for tomorrow. I don't really consider this to be a fast since my liquid calories are *so* high.

My goal is to be 5 pounds lighter a week from now, which I think is reasonable considering in the past I'd typically lose 3 pounds every 2 days of eating 500 calories. Weight loss will definitely slow down when I get back to school but at least I'm getting a good start over break.

I have absolutely nothing scheduled for tomorrow so I intend on sleeping in, running a few errands, going food shopping for low cal items to eat this week, doing some serious spring cleaning and overall just having 1 nice day to myself. Taking a long bath, giving myself a pedicure, etc. I haven't slept in even one morning since the semester started in January. I'm so happy to be on break. 

I hope you all had a lovely weekend!  </TEXT>

Yea my weekends tend to be similar. I have structure in the morning/early afternoon. Wake up and go ride my horse. I try to get a few bites of something in so I don't die while riding lol but once I'm home by 2pm/3pm, I get bored and feel like eating. I'm on spring break next week so I'm trying to really restrict hard all week (I've been trying to lose weight the healthy way, 1000-1400 calories) but I hate it and calorie counting has been really triggering :/ 

Anyways, I'm just trying to figure out how to keep myself busy while I'm home all week so I can successfully restrict and not eat above 500. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's best to eat these things spaced out. Turn them into "meals". Like every 3-4 hours, eat one of your safe foods. That way, instead of eating them then getting hungry (on the verge of a binge) in a few hours, you can eat a little here and there, and when you *do* start to get hungry, you know that in 1 or 2 hours you are able to have another one of your safe foods.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel similarly. I'm a college student, so Monday to Thursday are very structured for me. Class until 3:45, come home for a snack, go to the gym for an hour, come home for dinner, study then sleep. But the weekends don't have much structure and I find myself with a lot of free time, so it's not uncommon for me to graze on different foods before I realize I've eaten like 1,500 cals by 3pm! 

I guess just try to create a weekend schedule for yourself? Example: 

 Wake up at 9

 Shower at 10

 Go run errands until 1

 Go for a walk until 2

 Eat something at 3

 Browse the Internet until 6

 Do homework until 8

 Have something to eat at 8:30

Also, what app is that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I doubt any of you remember me as I haven't posted here since like August or September? Anyways I'm 22 and was anorexic between the ages of 14 and 20. I recovered shortly after I turned 21 but recovery led me to gaining weight. So here I am again. 

I tried losing weight the healthy way by eating 1200-1400 calories a day and exercising. I started lifting, too, and made gains but then I realized I **hate** making gains. My biceps and triceps are pretty big. I miss my dainty arms. 

Being a college student and equestrian athlete, it's really hard to restrict. School sucks the life out of me. I'm on spring break next week for one week so intend on resitrcting to 0-500 calories a day. I only really need to eat to fuel myself so I can ride my horse and not die. 

I may try to hit the gym next week but most likely I'll be too tired to do it. If I gather the energy to go, I'll probably just use the stationary bike and do some bodyweight training. I'm only 10 pounds to my goal weight so hopefully I'm down at least 4 pounds. That'll leave me with just 6 pounds to go. 

When I started losing weight the healthy way, I was really proud of myself for *actually* being able to do it. I always thought I would only be able to lose weigh through ED ways. But then calorie counting and counting my macros just triggered me too much and, well, here I am

	<TEXT> Yeah and if you're comfortable with it, maybe try eating a big meal a few hours before you get weighed. That could easily add an extra 2-3 pounds. It'll be temporary weight gain. In a day or two, you'd go back to weighing 2-3 pounds less.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wear a lot of clothes when you get weighed. In high school I went to a private school and our uniform was a blazer, dress shirt, skirt and tie. Also you had to wear tights or knee socks. I would wear the thickest tights I could find, I would wear one to two tank tops AND a long sleeved knit shirt under my dress shirt and if it wasn't too noticeable, I would wear a sweater over my dress shirt/under my blazer. It easily added an extra 5 lbs when I stepped on the scale. How often are you being weighed? Because say you're weighed once a month, and you have a total loss of 5 lbs, I'd say it's pretty understandable and reasonable to have lost 5 pounds over the course of a month with an amphetamine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a little confused about Bronkaid. When I google it, results show for some sort of shortness of breath medication. Is this what you're all talking about?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry I'm late to the party. 

I competitively ride horses so I'm riding a minimum of 4 days a week. A light ride will make me burn 300 calories and a high intensity ride makes me burn up to 600 calories. 

In addition to that, I workout at the gym 3 days a week. Each time it's 30 minutes of cardio and 30 minutes of weights/squats/body strength training. 

I don't go to the gym for weight loss. It's really just to improve as an athlete. 

My active lifestyle is relatively new and I've only been dragged into my eating disorder in the past month, so it's kind of hard to restrict and be so active. Therefore, I'm losing weight at a slower pace than I'm used to.

	<TITLE> Just wanted to share some success (and a bit of a failure) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> SO from restricting yesterday I'm down 2 lbs. Yay! My goal is to lose 3 more pounds by Saturday. Also, today I worked two horses and according to my Nike fuel band, I burned 592 calories between riding this one horse and my own horse. I was feeling great today!

But then my trainer suggested we go out for Mexican food...I was stressing about that so much but it ended up being not too bad. He ordered some nachos for us. It had chicken, cheese, black beans, guac, pico and sour cream. I stayed away from the guac, pico and sour cream but couldn't pick out the rest. I had 5 nachos and it left me satisfied, not full. I was slightly disappointed because I planned on restricting. 

I finished eating at the restaurant about 2 hours ago and I'm still not hungry so I probably won't eat the rest of the day. If I do, it'll be something small like fruit or yoghurt. 

Anyways, just wanted to share how proud I am of the 2 pounds in 1 day as well as the amazing amount of calories I burned today. Hope you're all having a great day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's remember that cheat days should not be synonymous to bingeing. That being said, the occasional cheat can actually boost your metabolism and speed up your weight loss process. With me at least, if I restrict for 6 days and have a cheat day on the 7th day, I find that my body appears slimmer on the 8th day. 

A cheat day to me is one of two things: 

**(1)** Selecting one meal on the day you plan on cheating and eating whatever you'd like for that one meal, but not eating any other meals. For example, in the past, I chose my breakfast to be my one cheat meal of the cheat day because I knew I was going out to breakfast with friends that day. I allowed myself to eat whatever I wanted for breakfast (a normal breakfast like eggs, toast and fruit, not ordering 3 different breakfast entrees like eggs, pancakes, hash browns, etc.) but did not allow myself to eat anything else the rest of the day. 

**(2)** Eating reasonable amounts of food for all 3 meals. Example: 

Breakfast: Yoghurt, granola, fruit. 

Lunch: Sandwich and soup. 

Dinner: Pasta with a side salad.

Those meal items would be healthy and normal for a person without an ED, but as someone with an ED, that feels like a lot of food and those are foods I would never eat while restricting. Well, I would eat maybe half a sandwich or a cup of a broth based soup while restricting. But definitely not together during the same meal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recovery never made me anxious until I stepped on the scale and realized the weight I gained. And the weight I gained wasn't from recovery - it was from eating poorly due to being depressed. Before my depressing break up, I weighed less than I do now (a healthy weight) and maintained that weight for about 6 months. 

And thank you :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really know where to begin with this. I guess I'll start with my age? I'm 21 and I've been struggling with anorexia since I was 14, and have been recovered on and off since I was 16. This year I thought I was totally recovered. I had been seeing my therapist every week and my eating habits have been great. Oh, I also have a horse and have a very active lifestyle as I am an amateur equestrian athlete. However, after a really nasty break up in April, I feel like I've let myself go. I put on 10 pounds due to not caring about my diet and skipping out on riding - all due to being depressed about my break up. 

I weighed myself earlier this week and could not believe I've put on 10 pounds. I always thought recovery was a beautiful thing, but right now I feel like restricting is so much easier. The thought of eating 3 full meals and 2 snacks a day like I had been doing while "recovered" is terrifying. The thought of putting more than 500 calories a day into my body is terrifying. I miss being able to effortlessly feel my ribs, hip bones and collar bones. I miss feeling completely drained and exhausted, falling asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow at night. I miss the energetic high from running on so few calories. 

Weighing how much I weigh is absolutely terrifying. I mean, I know I look great being an athlete and all, but the number scares me so much. I can't stand it anymore and I need support. So I'm here. 

I look forward to keeping in touch with the rest of you on this sub. 

(And no, this is not my main Reddit account. I'm sure you all understand.)

Also, the bot told me to flair this but I wasn't sure what flair this post would go under. Please forgive and correct me if there's another flair I should use! </TEXT>
