	<TEXT> I think a lot of the issues experienced by people are seen more often on this subreddit becuase they are more likely to complain. The people who are having a fun great time don't get their voice heard. The game WORKS FINE for me and I have had NO PROBLEMS so far. Everything is fine. People are just finding excuses for the game to be bad. Sure some people experience problems. But there are heaps of people who are running the game fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's composed for the show, but you can listen to a version stripped of the dialogue on youtube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Znl46M_Dg), although it fluctuates in volume and stuff cause it's hard to get good audio.

If anyone plays piano and wants to know the notes/grab a very basic score I can do that too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People don't appreciate this finale for what it was, they just like to abused it based on what it wasn't and what they expected it to be. It was actually a really good finale. Why? Because it felt like final end to the season. Sure, it wasn't great in parts - like the anticlimactic Governor storyline, but let's not get caught up on stuff like that. Trust in Kirkman and his team, especially now that Scott M. Gimple is showrunner.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Has anyone tried installing the game on an external HD and playing it? Would the bottleneck of only being able to transfer 450mbp/s really impact performance, considering a normal internal HD can go at 1000 or 2000mbp/s? Is that extra speed needed, particularly in this game where there aren't many loading screens... I know that the internal speeds are faster, I'm just wondering if that much speed is required... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah certainly. I think that Sophia's death was realistically a turning point for not only the characters but the show. It also happens to be one of my favourite scenes - so well directed and written by Scott M. Gimple - who is also the writer of S03E12 "Clear" and tomorrow night's ep, S03E15 "This Sorrowful Life". I really love his writing and can't wait till he becomes showrunner. Does anyone else know any other eps written by Gimple?

EDIT: I wrote Sophie instead of Sophia.. I was tired forgive me... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some major things that I think we're gonna get resolved this week:

-How Merle just vanished and for some reason there was a fake hand on the roof? Like WTF?

-Why Jim was digging the graves and how he got a cut shaped like a bite on his stomach

-They'll figure out where Sophia ever got to and who the hell that weird looking zombie girl who came out of the barn was

-Why Shane came back as a zombie and what the fuck they're all infected with? The flu?

-And why was there that random shot when Maggie was carrying out the baby after Lori died? And what was Carl doing at that point?

-How come Glenn says he's Korean, while Merle and Daryl say he's from China? Continuity? 

I just feel there are too many unresolved plotlines in this show at the moment.... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best way to read the comics? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-03-24 08:44:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm thinking of reading the comics after season 3 is finished, and I was wondering what way people find is the best way to read them? Do you like to read digital, hardcover, the paperback volumes, issue by issue, or by the compendium. Right now I'm opting for the paperback volumes, as it gives me enough to read for a while without being locked into reading a lot (as would happen with the compendium). I think this way out of concern for spoiling future seasons of the tv show, and I could stop before or after the prison arc, depending on what I decided later. 

Also, does anyone have any tips on where the cheapest place to buy the comics online for international delivery is?  </TEXT>
