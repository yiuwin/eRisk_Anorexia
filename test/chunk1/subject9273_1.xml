	<TITLE> [Solution] Rude players flying jets. </TITLE>

	<TEXT>    Remember that the lobby can always vote to have that person kicked from the lobby. Go to menu, online, players select and then kick.
   This would help a lot of players because instead of stealing the car I'm exporting people in jets will come and blow them up. Just gets annoying and recently there has been a sudden increase in the annoying players that fly jets. </TEXT>
