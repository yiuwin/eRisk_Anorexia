	<TEXT> Finishing 4th is a great accomplishment considering the caliber of teams that were in the tournament. But even with that, I still feel there is something to be desired. Our style of play was horrible in the tournament. We struggled to keep possession for more than 5 seconds at a time in some games and many players were wasteful with the ball. Going forward we looked terrible. However defensively I thought Brooks and Cameron were great. Over the next few months I'd like to see Klinsmann play the same defenders so that they can grow more as a unit, but keep switching up the midfield and attack so that we can figure out a combination of players that can put balls in the back of the net.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm very torn when it comes to this transfer. I think 20 mil is a bit excessive for a guy who's had one amazing season and nothing else. People think that he'll just pick up right where he left off when we really have no idea if that was just a fluke or not. But on the other hand this is a huge risk and I love to see Wenger finally take a risk. And Vardy could provide the finishing we so desperately need. I think he could bring a lot to the team if he can keep the form he had at Leicester this past season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm glad we made a signing already, but I'm not sure how well Xhaka is going to do at the Emirates. I've seen a lot of people jump on the bandwagon already, but I'm not too sure. He seems like a distributor to me, like Cazorla but in a deeper role. I'm not sure if he's quick enough to do the defensive work that Coq has been doing, with his slide tackles and hawking wingers down. I'm not saying he will be bad, but I think we'll definitely have to change our play style around in order to accommodate him. I'm thinking Wilshere or Ramsey at DM and Cazorla on the left with Alexis moving back to the right could work well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is going to sound really weird but whatever

So as an American I was never really exposed to football/soccer. A couple of my friends played soccer so I knew a little bit but not a lot. They told me to get FIFA 14 when it came out so I did. I was really bad at the game so I tried using a bunch of fast players so I could score. I liked using Arsenal players like Walcott and Ox because they were fast. Then I started watching some games and fell in love with the play style and the beautiful passing, I just loved how they played (and we were top of the table for a while at the beginning of the 13/14 season, that probably played a role in it, not going to lie). I'm not sure how I got so passionate about Arsenal because I don't have any friends that are Arsenal supporters, but I've become more passionate about Arsenal than any other team that I support.  </TEXT>

He can play a similar role that Giroud now plays but would give us more options on the counter because of his pace, in addition to the fact that he's just now turned 23 and has proved that he's a good finisher.

	<TEXT> Ideally I'd want a major overhaul, getting rid of players who aren't performing like Ox, Walcott, Ramsey (debatable), Mertesacker, etc. and replace them with better options. At CB I'd like a tall, strong player like perhaps Koulibaly or even Howedes, someone like that. My preferred option in the midfield would be Xhaka, and I'd like to buy an attacking mid/winger (maybe Isco or Lucas as they've both fallen out of the starting eleven at their respective clubs). I'd also like us to buy a striker, someone consistent. Their are many choices in that department. This overhaul will redefine the teams mentality and turn us into winners.

Realistically we'll only sign Xhaka and send some players out on loan though </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We could potentially be losing a large chunk of our team this summer.  Ozil has become insanely frustrated with his teammates, and we all saw Alexis storm off straight down the tunnel.  Santi has been injured and is continuously aging.  Wenger realizes we have younger talent to replace him.  If this happens, he'll buy a replacement for Ozil, but not for Alexis and not for Cazorla.  Wenger craves stability.  He doesn't like to spend unless he knows the player will fit right in without having to change anything.  Unless we can either retain these players or find good, solid replacements, we won't finish top 4.  I hope it doesn't come to this and Wenger realizes that we actually need a striker who can score goals consistently and a solid centre back that can handle the pace of the BPL, but unless he buys big names then there's no way we finish in at least a respectable spot.  

That being said, I'm sure Wenger realizes what is going on here.  He is a smart man and he knows that certain players aren't performing to the standards that are acceptable at this club.  I believe we will make signings and finish 2nd or 3rd next year with City winning it all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could the board perhaps be forcing Wenger to play domestic players like Walcott, Ox, and Welbz over Campbell?  I just don't understand, everyone else sees he's much better </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1.  Mertesacker and Gabriel...How about instead of worrying about why the ref didn't call a foul you get back and play some fucking defence?
2.  Giroud, what the fuck is wrong with you?  6 yard box and you hit the bar?  A 6 year old could have made that
3.  Bellerin, PLEASE learn how to cross the ball.  I couldn't tell you how many crosses he had that didn't go past the first man
4.  Monreal you need to learn how to use your right foot man
5.  Arsene Wenger, have you gone insane?  Take off arguably our best player so far this match for no reason?  And then after conceding, you decide to take off one of our most threatening players for a man who touches the ball about 10-15 times a game?  Yes we were extremely unlucky not to score more than 1 goal, but it's Swansea City, we shouldn't be blaming bad luck for not beating a relegation candidate.  This is disturbing </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you look back two seasons, the only one that has really progressed has been Ramsey.  Over the past two seasons he's gotten better.  But the rest haven't really changed too much and I think time should be running out for them considering their recent performances (yes Walcott, I'm looking at you). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry but you can't back Walcott.  He literally does nothing when he's on the pitch, and then scores like once every couple games to make people think he's relevant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We need to get rid of the dead weight and replace them with players who have some passion.  Walcott definitely and there's even an argument for the likes of Wilshere and Ox.  We need a consistent striker who's going to put the ball in the back of the net at a regular rate.  And we need a CB and a DM who don't make stupid decisions.  If these players are not bought then there's no way we can win the league.  Mertesacker and Coq can both be brilliant on their day but they both make reckless decisions that end up costing us big time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Walcott consistently does nothing game in and game out and then occasionally scores a goal, making everyone think he's vital to the team.  But he isn't at all.  I honestly do not understand why he is in the starting XI.  He's constantly caught offsides, makes horrible runs and doesn't finish them, doesn't track back, and he constantly gives the ball away.  If Arsene won't give Joel another shot then at least put Ramsey back up there.  Something has to change </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FUT takes a while to master, I suggest playing some offline tournaments first and maybe also using your draft token to play offline.  When I first went into online I struggled to score, but once I learned that you have to finesse basically everything I got better.  No matter how bad you might be at first though don't give up on it, just takes some getting used to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I've noticed that a lot.  I was up 5-1 at half and my opponent scored 3 goals in about 10 minutes of game time at the start of the second half.  And it's not that I'm bad at defending, I think it's some good old fashioned EA scripting.  Not necessarily a terrible thing though, it helps to keep the game interesting although it can be annoying </TEXT>
