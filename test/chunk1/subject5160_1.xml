	<TEXT> [Here is what NASA envisioned the ARM mission would look like. Its important to note, that the final version of ARM was signifigantly dumbed down from what it was originally supposed to be,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtbWbwHiro) a manned mission to a near earth asteroid. The original mission was supposed to send astronauts out to asteroid [1999AO10](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/01/nasas-flexible-path-2025-human-mission-visit-asteroid/) or a similar sized one. Once NASA figured out that they wouldnt be able to complete that mission, they then changed it to bring a smaller asteroid into lunar orbit so that astronauts could visit it. This was to satisfy an Obama administration era law that required NASA to have a manned mission to an asteroid. However, NASA did not believe that to be feasible either, so the mission was reduced futher to simply moving a boulder off an asteroid into lunar orbit where it could be studied. The mission devolved outside of its original goal of spurring manned deep space travel, it was just a matter of time until it was canceled in my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is also entirely possible within the framework of the story that there may have been prior members of the godhand, before the five we see now, that have been killed or destroyed. Its one possible explaination to the number of times the eclipse has occured since the dawn of the godhand and why there are only 5. It would make sense that Skull Knight has been able to previously defeat some of them given the specific tactics he is attempting to use against them. </TEXT>
