	<TITLE> Reducing 'Mental State' Level? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I believe your mental state automatically lowers over time - but does anyone have any metrics or hard information on that front? One "bar" per in-game day or something? Any ways to reduce it quicker?

I got stuck defending myself against a trio of red-dot players today, and quickly found myself in dark-pink territory for a fight I didn't start, and eventually began actively attempting to flee... haha. 

It's an interesting new game dynamic - and I happen to think it'll make the game more interesting: what do you think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been a moderately prominent YouTuber since 2007, and have been making my full-time income off the site for the past six years. [Here's my channel.](http://www.Jogwheel.com) - I'm best known for co-creating / producing ["Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?"](http://www.youtube.com/show/isitagoodideatomicrowavethis), where my friends and I microwaved over 300 items, and had way too much fun in the process.

I signed up for Reddit two years ago to host an AMA... but quickly got distracted by this wonderful site. So... to celebrate my 2nd cake day on Reddit, I'd love to (finally) chat with Reddit about my experiences, share my insights on YouTube (Content-ID, best-branding practices, channel management, video editing, etc.) or just talk about duck-sized horses.

And of course, shamelessly promote my yearly [Oscar-Special episode of "Movie Night"](http://youtu.be/b0oIurqekdI), which is my biggest production I create each year. Thanks for stopping by!

( [Proof](http://youtu.be/3Yjyn5vVkgE) )

**Cold Open**

Contrary to any misinformation you may have heard, YouTube didn't change any copyright policies last week... but they did make a slight adjustment to their Content-ID system. I want to explain how the system works, why it *doesn't* suck, how to deal with it, why it doesn't just affect gamers, and most importantly: what single quick fix could correct the entire system instantly.

**Introduction**

Hi, I'm Jonathan Paula. I apologize in advance, but this video will be a long, and exhaustive discussion on Content ID. Those in a rush can find a full script for this video in the description, and I'm including the topic-timeline above, which will hot-link you directly to the different topics I'll be covering in case you'd like to skip ahead. If you only have a minute, I suggest you watch the "Conclusion" section, where I discuss the BIGGEST thing I want you to take away from this video. And it goes with without saying: if you find this video informative or helpful in any way - please click the LIKE button, FAVORITE this video, and SHARE it around. It is crucial more people under these issues, so let's begin.

**Jon's Background**

This is a complicated issue with many nuances, but I am in an extremely unique position, as a content-creator who utilizes fair-use material often, as an owner of a multi-channel network, and as someone who has personally won over 500 separate copyright claims. I've been an independent YouTube Partner since the program first issued invites in January 2008 - In those seven years, I have been very fortunate and appreciative to earn my full-time income from this site. But the recent changes to YouTube's Content-ID system are jeopardizing my livelihood, as well as countless others on the site. 

**Content ID's Origins**

The Content-ID system, which was born out of necessity to handle and resolve lawsuits from companies like Viacom, utilizes sophisticated scanning technology to automatically match potentially infringing videos against a visual or audio reference file that exists in its database. Hollywood movie studios, record companies, game developers and even some top-tier YouTube partners like myself have access to YouTube's "Content Manager System", or CMS. These CMS accounts are the people who have the ability to input assets, or "reference files" *into* the Content-ID database (which is actually just YouTube itself). When I upload a new episode of "Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?", or when Universal Music releases Taylor Swift's new single... we have the option to apply what's known as a "match policy" for "automatic claims". Each asset owner can actually adjust the percentage of audio or video that needs to be featured to trigger a Content-ID match. They can also route these matches to a human agent for review, to reduce any false-positives. For game developers, the tools are already in place to detect an audio-only policy on their assets, which would easily exclude the vast number of lets players on YouTube, who provide their own commentary - just like it would be very easy for movie studios to do the same allowing film reviewers to continue their work unimpeded. Game developers CapCom, Blizzard, and Ubisoft were quick to apologize to many YouTubers who were "falsely-tagged" by their match policies last week, but honestly: it was their own fault. If they had paid attention to what policies they had enabled on their content, nothing would have been matched at all. Setup your policies appropriately! Scan only for audio, and route matches for manual review before any further action is taken. Ignorance is not an excuse: pay attention, instead of causing a lot of undue stress.

**Benefits Of Content ID**

When used correctly, Content ID is a powerful tool that can be very beneficial. By and large, it's actually a great system that protects millions of songs, movies, games, TV shows, and other work - keeping the revenue and ownership in the hands of its rightful owners. I love that I have a team of robots protecting my huge library of 2,500 videos from anyone who attempts to steal my work and profit from it - in fact, Jogwheel's videos are routinely stolen and re-uploaded about 15 times a week.

**Match Policies**

When potentially infringing material is uploaded, and Content-ID makes a match, CMS-owners have three options how to deal with the video: "Track", "Block", or "Monetize". Some companies may have no issue with you utilizing their game footage, or background music - and only want to track your content, to see how successful it is. A musician, like my friend Rob Scallon may encourage his audience to download his music, and sample it in their videos - The "Track" option would provide him with useful analytics on how many individuals took him up on that offer, without penalizing them for it. Whereas FOX Broadcasting may see an entire episode of Family Guy as a particularly egregious upload, and they'll block the video - making it unwatchable to everyone on YouTube. But by far, the most common policy is to "monetize" the content. The infringing material remains on YouTube, publicly viewable to the world, but instead of the uploader earning revenue on the video, the earnings are given to the CMS-account that applied the ownership policy in the first place. Now, you'll notice I didn't say the "proper right's holder".  And this is inherently Content's ID most public flaw, but not its worst: any CMS account can upload content, and apply a match policy as their own. And this process is unfortunately far easier than you'd think. As a result, some companies - either by malicious intent, or more likely by an innocent accident, have applied polices to assets they don't actually have legal ownership of. Many less informed YouTubers have complained when they get an erroneous match from some random company -- claiming theyre being scammed out of income. In all likelihood, there was an overlap between policies, or some intern at Blizzard Entertainment clicked the wrong checkbox. But, if these false-claims *were* intentional? Well, YouTube really needs to crack down on them. With a site as big as this, with over 10 years of content uploaded every day... a few stray, incorrect matches are not really a big deal. To extend the example from earlier, Taylor Swift is not personally clicking the "flag" button to remove cover-versions of her songs off the site. Instead YouTube's Content-ID robots, under Universal Music Group's instruction are automatically detecting these uploads. 

**Multi-Channel Networks**

Those inside a multi-channel network (MCN for short), and CMS-partners themselves, were previously excluded from a majority of Content-ID scans. It was generally assumed, that if you were partnered with Machinima, or part of Sony Pictures Entertainment, you weren't going to upload any infringing content - part of an unconfirmed "Trust algorithm" YouTube placed on its larger partners. Again, let me repeat that: partners inside an MCN were protected NOT because their network secured permission from gaming companies, but because they were excluded from Content-ID scans. So many people, include dozens of top-level gamers on this site are under the misinformed impression that networks provided them a service. They didn't. They typed their channel into a box, and by proxy of their "trust level", their partners were seemingly protected. Somewhere down the line however, YouTube introduced three separate tiers of partnership within a network: "Managed", "Affiliated", and "Whitelisted" - if you're signed to an MCN, and not on YouTube's top-500 most subscribed list, you're likely an "Affiliate" partner, and until recently, that meant you were given the same amount of "trust" as whomever you were networked with. As a result, you would have been protected by automatic Content-ID claims... you could still of course be hit with the occasional manual match - so while you may have been able to get away with posting copyrighted material for a time, it didn't mean you were safe, and it definitely didn't mean you were without legal fault.

**Recent Changes To The System**

This all changed last week. YouTube released a statement on December 11th explaining, "We recently enabled Content ID scanning on channels identified as affiliates of MCNs. This has resulted in new copyright claims for some users, based on policies set by the relevant content owners. As ever, channel owners can easily dispute Content ID claims if they believe those claims are invalid." Meaning, if you're in a network, you're no longer protected. If you're an independent YouTuber without a CMS-level account... literally nothing has changed for you, except now everyone else is complaining about the same issues you've been dealing with since day one.

**What Are Your Options?** 

When the system matches a video to one or more policies issued by CMS-accounts, the uploader will receive an e-mail, explaining what type of policy has been applied. In this particular case, Warner Bros. applied a "Monetize" policy on this episode of Movie Night. So, while you can still watch that video, I am no longer earning revenue from it. Obviously, this is better than having the video outright blocked. Occasionally though, the system makes mistakes - like the aforementioned erroneous matches from random companies, or by detecting content that isn't actually infringing. Maybe you secured permission first, or your usage qualifies as fair use, or the person issuing the claim doesn't own the rights to the content either. These are valid, legitimate, and most importantly LEGAL defenses if your content is incorrectly matched. Luckily, YouTube has tools in place to dispute matches you believe to be false. By clicking the link provided in that e-mail, or by visiting the "Copyright Notices" section of your channel's video manager, you will see a link below the matched video that reads "matched third party content". Clicking this link provides you with an explanation of the match, a time-code link to the exact portion of the video containing the allegedly infringing material, and the name of the claimant who issued the match. You now have two options available, "Acknowledge", or "Dispute". If you believe the claim to be genuine, as in... you knowingly uploaded copyrighted material without permission, you'd select "Acknowledge", which doesn't adversely affect your account any worse than the match itself... it simply solidifies the ruling, preventing you from disputing it again later. But, if you disagree with the match, either on fair use grounds, or if you have permission to use the content, you can file a dispute. 

**Fair Use Explanation**

Now, I'm not a lawyer, so I won't provide legal advice regarding fair use -- but generally, news reporting, criticism, reviews, commentary, parodies, or some transformative use... are instances *I* would classify as fair use. As for all you gamers and let's players out there, of which I count myself as one... the argument for fair use is trickier, especially since there is zero legal precedent to argue either way. In America, our fair use copyright law was written in 1976 - so while it covers film criticism, song parodies, and news reporting...  telling jokes while you play Call Of Duty may not qualify. 

**The Effect On The Gaming Community**

Inherently, the unique value of lets play videos are the personalities, not necessarily the gameplay footage: but until an actual judge rules one way or another: tread carefully in this space, and attempt to secure permission from the game developers whenever possible. Almost ALL of the frustration and outrage last week came from gamers. But why are they so upset? Lets play exist within a grey area of the law, and the fact that your videos weren't being tagged before was absolutely no indication it'd stay that way forever. So while I take issue with people being upset and surprised by these changes, it doesn't seem like good news for the gaming community. Almost all uploads going forward will be immediately Content-ID scanned, and as we discussed, your options for disputing are not  as legally viable as other types of fair-use content. But really, what it comes down to is that if you're not confident you can win a dispute, you shouldn't be uploading to begin with... unless you're comfortable with not earning revenue. Practically speaking though, last week's change will scare many people off, and the community will suffer as a result. But for those who do have a legal right to their content, and are willing to defend their work, hopefully they can stick around and continue producing awesome stuff.

In this particular case, Warner Bros. applied a "Monetize" policy on this episode of Movie Night. So, while you can still watch that video, I am no longer earning revenue from it. Obviously, this is better than having the video outright blocked. Occasionally though, the system makes mistakes - like the aforementioned erroneous matches from random companies, or by detecting content that isn't actually infringing. Maybe you secured permission first, or your usage qualifies as fair use, or the person issuing the claim doesn't own the rights to the content either. These are valid, legitimate, and most importantly LEGAL defenses if your content is incorrectly matched. Luckily, YouTube has tools in place to dispute matches you believe to be false. By clicking the link provided in that e-mail, or by visiting the "Copyright Notices" section of your channel's video manager, you will see a link below the matched video that reads "matched third party content". Clicking this link provides you with an explanation of the match, a time-code link to the exact portion of the video containing the allegedly infringing material, and the name of the claimant who issued the match. You now have two options available, "Acknowledge", or "Dispute". If you believe the claim to be genuine, as in... you knowingly uploaded copyrighted material without permission, you'd select "Acknowledge", which doesn't adversely affect your account any worse than the match itself... it simply solidifies the ruling, preventing you from disputing it again later. But, if you disagree with the match, either on fair use grounds, or if you have permission to use the content, you can file a dispute. 

**Fair Use Explanation**

Now, I'm not a lawyer, so I won't provide legal advice regarding fair use -- but generally, news reporting, criticism, reviews, commentary, parodies, or some transformative use... are instances *I* would classify as fair use. As for all you gamers and let's players out there, of which I count myself as one... the argument for fair use is trickier, especially since there is zero legal precedent to argue either way. In America, our fair use copyright law was written in 1976 - so while it covers film criticism, song parodies, and news reporting...  telling jokes while you play Call Of Duty may not qualify. 

**The Effect On The Gaming Community**

Inherently, the unique value of lets play videos are the personalities, not necessarily the gameplay footage: but until an actual judge rules one way or another: tread carefully in this space, and attempt to secure permission from the game developers whenever possible. Almost ALL of the frustration and outrage last week came from gamers. But why are they so upset? Lets play exist within a grey area of the law, and the fact that your videos weren't being tagged before was absolutely no indication it'd stay that way forever. So while I take issue with people being upset and surprised by these changes, it doesn't seem like good news for the gaming community. Almost all uploads going forward will be immediately Content-ID scanned, and as we discussed, your options for disputing are not  as legally viable as other types of fair-use content. But really, what it comes down to is that if you're not confident you can win a dispute, you shouldn't be uploading to begin with... unless you're comfortable with not earning revenue. Practically speaking though, last week's change will scare many people off, and the community will suffer as a result. But for those who do have a legal right to their content, and are willing to defend their work, hopefully they can stick around and continue producing awesome stuff.

	<TITLE> YouTube (obviously) adjusted something to their Content-ID system yesterday. Here are some tips on dealing with disputes and appeals. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Lots of my videos (EDIT: 125+ claims in 12 hours), across several channels are getting Content-ID matched today. Some videos that had been unaffected for over FIVE years, and others which had previously been appealed, and won. A majority of these claims are legitimate however: originating from the proper copyright holder. I have legal rights to these videos (most of them "Movie Night" film reviews)... and I've disputed them as I always do... and will likely win 100% of them. But, of the 400+ matches I've received over the years... this is the most I've seen in a single afternoon.

I have yet to receive any matches on my let's play / gaming content... but if you see any claims, don't panic -- make sure the claim is being filled from the legitimate copyright holder, and even still: don't be afraid to dispute on fair use grounds... if you win, you get your video (and it's ad revenue returned to you)... and if you lose, the video will likely remain public and unblocked, but the revenue will be directed towards the claimant - which is exactly what will happen if you do nothing. Remember: here is NO RISK in disputing a content-ID match!

If, and ONLY if/when you lose a dispute, you'll gain the option to appeal the match / decision. If you are confident your usage qualifies as fair use (or, you legally obtained a license / permission to use the material), consider risking a copyright strike, and submitting this APPEAL: these are actually reviewed by human agents, and most studios/companies will release their claim if anything seems remotely close to fair use. They don't want court battles and fines either. To date, I've had to submit 48 of these riskier appeals, and have won all 48. Again though, if you lose an appeal, you'll receive one of three possible copyright strikes, so tread carefully, and only appeal when you think you have a strong case... or, appeal via a dummy upload on a test account, to see how the rights-holder will respond.

TL;DR: Defend your content! There's no harm in DISPUTING a claim... but only APPEAL if you're confident you have some legal, fair-use to the content.

	<DATE> 2013-11-16 13:15:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Forgive my ignorance, I've managed to reach level 45 using the small amount of free time I'm afforded, and only recently came across what I originally assumed was a glitch, but is perhaps more likely a "clean driver" reward? 

So, if someone can confirm: do you lose (potential) RP for driving into other racers in a non-GTA race? I bump into others all the time, but only once saw my total RP affected to the point where racer #2 earned more than me. If so, I'm curious what classifies as "dirty" racing - do your actions have to directly cause a player to respawn, or miss a checkpoint? Is it X-number of bumps before registering? Any hard info would be appreciated, thanks :)

	<TEXT> I don't even know where to begin... they've finally done it. YouTube/Google has completely borked the backbone of the entire site: its community aspect. 

Forcing users to link G+ accounts to comment is complicated, and broken... ***I am not able to see new comments via my inbox***, or even reply to them on the video page! A bunch get held up in "approval" mode, and untold millions will never bother to comment again, so long as YouTube forces them to use G+.

No one likes Google+... no one asked for these changes... why does YouTube insist on making the site broken and unusable? 

Removing the ability to comment / read comments easily is the single **WORST** mistake YouTube has ever made. Completely hate everything about this...

	<TEXT> Since it seemed like many were too afraid to actually dispute the wave of incoming Nintendo ID-matches, I went ahead and disputed the only one I received: a manual tag on a random episode of my "Super Mario World" LP - on fair-use grounds. Nintendo's response here should give us a good idea of their intention going forward, in regards to other Nintendo gameplay videos and LPs. Here is the video I'm disputing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wSjhSIczLc -- feel free to watch and give feedback :)


I've fought and won hundreds of fair-use disputes in the past, (mostly for my movie review show, not gaming) and even won a dozen double-appeals (the more involved ones that risk copyright strikes). I hope to educate folks on this process, that shouldn't be scary or avoided: but used effectively as a tool in the new media frontier. If you have any questions about the Content-ID / copyright system process on YouTube, or how the process effects the network side of things (I technically run a network), please let me know - and I'll do my best to answer. Good luck with your LPs!

EDIT: screenshot: http://imgur.com/lXNEnNF

UPDATE #1 (May 29th, +12 days later): My dispute is still awaiting response from Nintendo, and typically, if the rights-holder doesn't reply back within the first 5 business days - they won't reply at all, and the dispute will lapse, and ownership will revert to 100% mine. </TEXT>

I've had steady, consistent credit card use for almost ten years now - and recently applied, and received my third card (promptly spent the $500 to retrieve my bonus cash too!)... but as I'm new to this more aggressive churning lifestyle: how long should I wait before I apply for a new card, in effort to milk those sign-up rewards?

I know too many hard-inquiries can hurt my credit score: but how detrimental is it for someone already past the major school/car/home purchases? Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Calculating your content's *true* worth, and learning the difference between RPM and CPM! -- Important discussion for all those considering a Network partnership. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-01-13 17:35:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Prompted by a conversation I had with **allcapsarelocked**, and others in the past few months on this SubReddit, it occurs to me that many people are confused as to what their content makes per 1,000 views. So here's a quick - *and crucial* education for everyone!

**Example image / quick version**: http://imgur.com/z33Bi

* Don't confuse CPM with RPM! "Cost per thousand" represents the *total* cost sold on the video, 45% of which goes to YouTube directly, and never makes it to your bank account. Whereas RPM = "revenue per thousand" (it's originally from the Greek "mile", which meant 1,000) is the number YOU receive. It's important to learn the difference, as a Network Contract might offer you a "$5 CPM", but again, you'll never see more than ~55% of such a figure. 

* Ignore Google Adsense's numbers/reports. I've been earning a living from YouTube for five years now, and I *still* don't understand what any of that "Page CTR" shit means. Those numbers are incomplete, don't factor in your "YouTube earnings", and only focus on specific ads. Instead...

* **USE ANALYTICS**: Select a time range (Networks are fond of looking at 6-month averages to gage a channel's general success over time), and take the **"Total Estimated Earnings"** figure. Then, divide this by... 

* **"Estimated Monetized Playbacks"**, which you'll find on the far right of the "Ad Performance" tab -- this is the truest and most accurate assessment of your content (more so than "monetized views" or regular views) -- as it counts each and every *ad impression*, which is especially critical to LPers, as many of us use multiple advertisements per video (a pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll in a 24 minute upload, for example). 

* Take this figure, and **multiple by 1,000**. That number, likely in the $4 - $10 range, (determined by many factors, including number of ads served, type of content, metadata, time of the year, etc.) represents your TRUE RPM. That is what your content is worth, *especially* so if you calculate over a six-month span, or longer... as individual videos in a short-time period aren't necessarily an accurate measure of your success, especially during the Holiday Season when ad prices spike.

* For those (like me, sometimes) too lazy to do the math, try the http://www.clickz.com/cpm-calculator to calculate your RPM totals, or work the formula in reverse if you're trying to see what a Network's flat-rate of $3.00 would get you, for example. All networks that offer a "flat-rate" calculate your revenue based on "Estimated Monetized Playbacks" - not views.


**TL;DR**: In YouTube analytics, divide "Total Estimated Earnings" by "Estimated Monetized Playbacks", and then multiple by 1,000 to get your true RPM -- Compare this to a Network's offer, and **negotiate**! -- Good luck, and let me know if you have questions!

	<TITLE> Discussion: Why do LPers join networks? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-10 21:06:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As an outsider to this issue, I don't entirely understand the decision process for young channels/gamers. So, I was hoping you could help me clear up some confusion I have regarding networks, and why channels join. Specifically: if you're in a network now, or thinking about joining one: why did you? Was it for promotion? Was it for an automatic-parntership you didn't think you could get otherwise? Was it because you needed to hurdle the "Content-ID wall", to make sure your content was protected verses being potentially taken down?


As an independent YouTuber, you can still achieve a partnership, keep 100% of your earnings, and likely see RPM totals north of $8 with long-form LP content. Whereas, many networks' starting offers take 30% of your earnings, and offer flat RPM rates of only $2.00. Is the promise of "promotion" or "protection" from these networks enough incentive to give up so much of your income? 


I hate to see YouTubers make poor business decisions, and this is one is easily the biggest issue facing the community today, so I hope a discussion will be educational for all of us. Thanks for answering my questions in advance. I'm a independent network owner myself: so if you have any questions regarding the other side of the equation (how Content-ID works, etc), I'd be happy to help.


EDIT: TL;DR question --
Unable to easily secure a full YT partnership on their own, are LPers at a disadvantage, that forces them to sign bad contracts with greedy networks? Verses YouTubers that create more traditional content? </TEXT>
