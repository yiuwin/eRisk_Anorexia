	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before episode 8 comes out in a few days I wonder if there are episode recaps somewhere? Or if someone on this sub can quickly summarize what has happened? I know a lot of it is mysterious and maybe can't be explained yet, so maybe the summary will mostly be a lot of "we don't know why [x] has happened yet."
But I always forget stuff that has happened within the two weeks between episodes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NOT American Crime Story. 

American Crime is also a crime anthology. But it's not based off of true stories. The first two seasons have been amazing. Each season showed all the different perspectives of a single crime. I'm desperately hoping it gets a third season. 

It seems like no one on this sub watches it. I didn't think it'd be popular. But I thought I'd see it mentioned once or twice.

	<TEXT> I like the show as well. It's not great by any means, but I still like it. And I'm pretty sure Lena Dunham's character is supposed to be an idiot. In the show Hannah is so obnoxious and annoying but I love it. It's really cringey but I've always loved cringe comedy.

If you don't like cringe comedy and you DEFINITELY shouldn't watch it. </TEXT>
