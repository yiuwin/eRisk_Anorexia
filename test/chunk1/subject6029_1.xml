	<TEXT> In the Dark Sun campaign setting (a setting I am currently preparing to run), there is a half-dwarf race called a Mul. 

Here is my version of them which is quite similar to yours. 



Mul

Muls are about the same height as humans, but have broader shoulders. Your size is medium. 

The children of humans and dwarves, almost every Mul is bred into slavery. Prided on their incredible endurance, slave owners will pay large sums to acquire Mul slaves. Whether they be used for hard labor, body guards or gladiatorial combat, Muls are never to be underestimated. 

+2 constitution 
+1 to any other stat

Your speed is 30 feet, it is not reduced by wearing heavy armour.

Every time a Mul gains a level in a class, their hit point maximum increases by one. 

When a Mul drops to 0 hp but is not killed outright, they regain one hp. You must complete a long rest before this ability can be used again. 

Because of your incredible endurance, you have a +3 on saving throws against sun sickness.  

You have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against it. 

Muls begin play speaking either common or dwarvish.

	<TEXT> I played an Eldritch knight a while ago, I found the best spell's and cantrip a are one that can be used in conjunction with your martial ability. 

Use some of the cantrips in the SCAG, they're very good for half casters, shocking grasp is good because you can take down very high ac enemies by standing in front of them and shocking their metal armor, and unlike most spell casters, you can survive a few hits from them. 

False life is quite useful and hex works great in conjunction with your multi attack.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Feeling more fulfilled in life is one of the reasons I want to return to faith, I want to truly believe in Christianity rather than just pretend to believe. What I meant in my first question was does the bible contain passages that do not accurately reflect the world we live in? Or does evidence exist in the world that points away from the truth?and if so, why does the evidence exist? 

Logic dictates that one of these observations must be correct. Events in the bible I am specifically talking about are mostly about astronomy. Such as the idea that the earth is flat, that the sun orbits around the earth and that the moon creates light.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was raised Christian and most of most of my friends are Christian. I went to church when I was younger but my family has fallen out of the habit. Right now, I would label myself agnostic but I want to return to the Christian belief. Many of the questions I have are unanswered and I feel they are preventing me from accepting God again.  

Some of my questions are as follows,

Why does the bible contain falsehoods?/ If everything in the bible is true, why is there evidence that seems to lead away from the existence of God?  

God is the embodiment of all that is good, so why do innocents come into harm? 

I understand the feeling that some resonance of good exists in the world, but how do we know that the Christian cosmology is the correct system of belief?

I was much happier in life when I was a Christian and I feel a sense of purpose is needed for me to continue to function like a human being.

	<TEXT> [5e] for an upcoming dark sun campaign I will be running I have created a system to make use of defilement magic. Feedback needed. 

Rules of defilement. 

Defilement is a form of magic that uses the life force of living things, and transforms it into energy that the spellcaster can use. 

Wizards, eldritch knights and arcane tricksters use defilement magic. 

When the defilement is casts a spell of first level and higher, the DM will asses the terrain in a circle around the spell caster. The radius of the the circle equals 5 feet x the level the spell is being cast at. 

1. No plant life in the area. 
2. Patches of grass and/or small cacti.
3. Grassy field or lots of vegetables and fruit. 
4. Dense vegetation. 

The caster may instead target a living plant object like a tree or a large cactus within 30 feet. Depending on the size of the object, the DM will use the rules of terrain level 3 or 4. 


On terrain level one, the caster must use their own life force to cast the spell. The caster takes necrotic damage equal to 2x the level of the spell. 


On terrain level two, the spell is cast as normal. 

On terrain level three, the spell caster's  spell save DC and their spell attack modifier increases by 1 until the end of their turn. 


On terrain level four, the spell caster's  spell save DC and their spell attack modifier increases by 2 until the end of their turn.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have created an efreeti warlock patron for an upcoming dark sun campaign that I will be running and I would like some feedback. I will be creating a djinn patron at later date so any ideas for that will also be appreciated. 

Efreeti warlock patron


Your patron is a powerful genie from the elemental plane of fire.
Most of your power manifests in flame, but you have some control over the other elements as well. 

Expanded spell list 

1st level: Burning hands, absorb elements. 
2nd level: flame blade, scorching Ray 
3rd level: fire ball, gaseous form
4th level: conjure minor elementals, wall of fire
5th level:conjure elemental, flame strike

Fiery altercation 
At first level, you can choose to change the damage type of any cantrip you cast, to fire. 
Also, any time you reduce a creature's hit points to zero using fire damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to your charisma modifier + your warlock level. 

Wrath of the Efreeti 
At level 6,
Your bond with a genie allows you to attack with incredible speed, once per long rest, you may have choose to have advantage on your attack roll. 
You also gain resistance to fire damage. 


Level 14
Cast into the conflagration. 
You can use your action to tap a creature and teleport them to the sea of flame in the elemental plane of fire. The target takes 10d12 fire damage. The creature reappears in one round. 
Once you have used this feature you must take a long rest before you can use it again.

I'm attempting to create genie warlock patrons for an upcoming dark sun campaign I will be running (in that setting the only planes outside the material plane are elements). So far I have created the efreeti patron and would like some feedback on it. 

I also plan to make a djinn patron at a later date so any advice on that would be appreciated.

6th level.  Mental might

14th level. Psionic wrath

When you are hit by a melee attack you can use your reaction to deal psychic damage equal to your psion level. The attacker must also make a strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail they are pushed 20 feet away from you in a straight line. 


18th level. Aspect of influence. 

 beginning at 18th level you gain immense power in mental influence. 
As an action you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude terror or control (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet.

	<TITLE> Damage resistance variant rule. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-12 21:31:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Mechanic]

In the players handbook it suggests that damage resistances of the same type do not stack, that a fire resistant creature wearing fire resistant armor has no advantage over a fire resistant creature without. While I understand they did this for the sake of simplicity, it does not appear very realistic to me. I also do not like the idea of 1/4ing or 1/8ing the damage as would be the solution if you just repeated the rule. 

This is my solution. Let's say the character is from a cold resistant race and they have a class feature that also gives them cold resistance. They are hit with cold damage. 

First, half the damage. Next roll a resistance die (1d6) and subtract the amount from the damage taken. More level s of resistances? Add another resistance die for each level of resistance on top of that. 

Is this balanced? Should I change the die size? Any thoughts are appreciated. 

I am new to this sub so if I broke any rules please inform me.  </TEXT>

The abandoned city built by the proud cloud giants in ancient times. 

One cannot fathom what kind of apocalyptic event forced the massive and powerful cloud giants to abandon their home and leave vast fortunes in treasure behind. 

The ruins of Jotunskye is one of the most prominent landmarks in all of Stormfall, and definitely the most dangerous. The city spans miles and without a map, getting lost surrounded by towering crumbling buildings is a very real possibility. 

Caravans funded by the aristocrats of Gloomwater will sometimes be sent to the ruins in search of riches information or both.  They are always heavily guarded by mercenaries as the city of the Jotunskye is infested with danger. 

Roving monsters prowl the surface of the city as well as the commodious sewer network that lies under the streets. 

It is said that a wicked dragon, ancient and massive has claimed the largest treasure horde in the city and is continually expanding it using his legions of kobolds and his elite Dragonborn guard. 

Some rumours speak of a city of the Aliens called Mind flayers hidden deep underneath the city
Constructed on the backs of thralls enslaved by the strange power of psionics, and using the hull of the spacecraft they arrived in long ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have created a creepy little village for my players to find and feedback would be appreciated. 

The village of Muertocan

A small settlement on an isolated point in the archipelago of Calim, whose residents all appear to be somewhat well off. But most strangely, the children in the town all seem to look quite sickly. Upon closer inspection one would see that the children all have tiny markings running up their arms which look like they were made by tiny needles. If any children are asked about the markings they reply with "I'm not supposed to say" or by running away. If any adults are asked they will deny having any knowledge of where the marks came from. At the DM discretion insight checks will reveal that all the residents are hiding something. If the adults are pressured about the truth they will say something along the lines of "you foreigners wouldn't understand." If children are convinced to tell the truth they will say something like "mommy and daddy take my blood."  

If the players are awake during the night of a new moon, they will see a broken down ship sail in and drop anchor near the dock. Ghosts dressed as sailers will then float down to the docks and start trading with the adults of Muertocan for vials filled with children's blood, the only currency the ghosts will accept. In exchange they will give coins, gems and sometimes even magic items depending on how much blood they receive. The ghosts will only become hostile if someone tries to take their vials of blood. At the end of the night the ghosts will float back up to their ship and then sail away as their ship fades away with the light of the rising sun.  

If any living creatures come aboard the ship when the ghosts are returning to it they will see the ghosts each open a coffin with dead bodies in various levels of decay. The ghosts will walk up to the coffin holding their own dead body and poor the blood they have received onto the corpse. Upon contact with the children's blood the corpse will begin reforming, growing back tissue. Eventually once enough blood is poured on it the corpse will be complete. The corresponding ghost will merge with it and the sailor will return to life. Then they will leave the ghost ship and attempt to start anew.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 5e Dhampir homebrew (half-vampire) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-27 20:42:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I would appreciate feedback on this homebrew I've been making. Not just looking for opinions on whether it is too over/under powered but also stuff I should add/take away to make it feel more like I'm playing a dhampir.


Dhampir.
The child of a living human and an undead vampire. 

The life of a dhampir is a walk along the thin line separating life and death. Not truly dead and yet not truly alive the life force of a dhampir is one difficult to comprehend. Though dhampir do not need blood to survive, feeding on the life fluid of the living invigorates them like nothing else. 
Sometimes, the sight of blood (after not consuming it for a lengthy period) can drive a dhampir into a frenzy.  Some have trained themselves to only feast upon the blood of animals while others have fallen to their most primal instincts and behave much like their monstrous parentage. 
 While the dhampir do not possess the same weaknesses as their vampiric parent, they have trouble seeing in the light of the sun and have an aversion from running water.

	<TEXT> I would appreciate feedback on this homebrew I've been making. Not just looking for opinions on whether it is too over/under powered but also stuff I should add/take away to make it feel more like I'm playing a dhampir.


Dhampir.
The child of a living human and an undead vampire. 

The life of a dhampir is a walk along the thin line separating life and death. Not truly dead and yet not truly alive the life force of a dhampir is one difficult to comprehend. Though dhampir do not need blood to survive, feeding on the life fluid of the living invigorates them like nothing else. 
Sometimes, the sight of blood (after not consuming it for a lengthy period) can drive a dhampir into a frenzy.  Some have trained themselves to only feast upon the blood of animals while others have fallen to their most primal instincts and behave much like their monstrous parentage. 
 While the dhampir do not possess the same weaknesses as their vampiric parent, they have trouble seeing in the light of the sun and have an aversion from running water.

	<TEXT> 5e. I'm playing a great old one warlock Worshipper of Zargon and I've been managing to turn various members of my party into Zargon worshippers as well, so far I've turned a lawful good paladin into a lawful evil oath breaker paladin who acts as my body guard. I bribed the assassin into joining our side too. 
On the other side there is an arcane trickster, a powerful barbarian and a chaotic neutral pact of the fiend warlock. There is also a sorceress and we are not really sure who's side she is on. 


How can we achieve victory over the rest of the party? Should we threaten to kill them if they do not submit? Should we just attempt to murder them in their sleep?

Our last session is next week so I need a plan quickly. 

We are sixth level by the way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 5e. Last session my players ran into a powerful demon lord who has been a pain in their necks through most of the campaign. they found him torturing the new player character and I had a whole role playing encounter set. 

Before my demon lord could even get a word in my cleric cast banishment and the demon got a natural 1 on the saving throw. 

How long does this banishment last? For killing demon lords I think in the chronicles of drizzt it was 100 years but how long does a simple banishment last?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been running a homebrew campaign with a recurring NPC demon lord named Abbadon (who I'm basing off Graz'zt.) I've heard that the official stats for Graz'zt can be found in the "Rage of demons" module but I don't really want to buy the book just for that. 
Anyone know where I can find what I'm looking for? </TEXT>
