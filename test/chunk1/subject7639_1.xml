	<TITLE> Naval Blockades (stopping enemy trade) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Is it possible to stop enemy trade by some sort of blockade ? Getting resources is more important than ever in this new game and as Japan, I wanted to stop Chinese from getting the resources they need to produce guns. Same can be applied to the British, they would want to blockade Germans too. But there isn't any option about closing enemy ports, just hunting convoys. And that is not very effective, as most convoys slip pass anyway. Anybody know anything about this ?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Beating Soviets (as germans) and general production plan </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello, after my recently unsuccessful plan-z game, I decided to go old-school and invade France-Soviet Union. I've been in a multi game too. Soviets simply seem much more powerful compared to Germans, they produce more, they have a lot of more manpower, and they control most of the oil germany needs. As germany, I tried to attack them but simply outnumbered, I got bogged down easily. I also can't seem to make good pockets like back in HOI3, since these new attack plans are generally very broad, and don't seem to do well in encirclement. Can some of you experienced guys give me a few tips about how to beat them ? And yeah, how should I prepare for Barbarossa ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, I was mainly fighting air battles as a pilot, but I also decided to give land battles a shot, and I bought myself a anti-air vehicle. (flakpanzer 1) And I jumped into a few arcade battles, but there seems to be very few aircraft flying around. What am I supposed to do with AA's exactly ? Since few aircraft flying around, they don't seem to get enough XP. Can somebody explain to me this stuff ?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Using speed advantage in a dogfight </TITLE>

	<TEXT> This situation just happens to me a lot, where I have the speed advantage on someone and start shooting at them from their tail, but since I'm faster I just outrun them and they shoot me down. How am I supposed to use my speed-energy advantage in a fight ? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best equipment for NCO's </TITLE>

	<TEXT> You know, NCO's can be equipped with a pistol and binoculars, pistol and two grenades and a rifle-bayonet. Which equipment is best for NCO? I think a lot about this, binoculars seem to be only way to get accurate mortar rounds, although two grenades can be useful in clearing trenches, rifle also helps a lot in general. What do you guys think ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In real life,

Would you have a good family with a good child and loving wife,

Or would you have a real house-defending level 3 sentry-dispenser and teleporter entry-exit to go wherever you want at any time ? (Also a respawning ammo box in your house, for metals) </TEXT>
