	<TEXT> Looks really interesting. I've always really loved movie poster art and get excited when a new book of an artist's work or a project like this comes along and spotlights it. 

As big of a fan of his work as I am, this looks like it'll be better than the recent Drew Struzan documentary. As someone mainly working in digital art these days, I was soured on it somewhat because of the antiquated, quasi-offensive view they hold onto regarding digital illustrating, simply lumping absolutely everything done on a computer with the shittiest of generic floating head posters. Not everything done on a computer is garbage and not everything painted on canvas is a sacred work of art.

Anyway..sorry, that really stuck in my craw. I'm as excited about seeing the old masters getting some attention once again as I am about the coverage of the Mondo posters and the resurgence of cool poster art. I'm especially looking forward to seeing Jason Edmiston's work, he's amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think what makes Wilfred work independently, possibly better as I ruminate on it, is that there's much more fueling Ryan's hallucinations. The backstory with the cult and his parents and details of growing up is such a rewarding explanation for how Wilfred came to be, where there is nothing specific that conjures Tyler Durden out of the aether and his appearance and character is nothing beyond being "id".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've thought about this too. I guess it might depend on how exactly the "ending" criteria is defined, as some big moments kinda blend together and could only *maybe* be interpreted as endings. Here's what I'd identify at least as bullet points that contribute to the closure of the narrative.

- Learning about the cult from his mother
- Meeting his father, learning more about what specifically fueled his psychosis
- Jenna leaving with Drew
- Kristen's new job
- Seeing the truth about the basement
- Choosing Wilfred </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is something that's been sticking in my head too. I was very satisfied with the ending but I have to wonder how well a rewatch will go. I worry the show in general will, at best, turn into something rather depressing and awkward and at worse Ryan will become extremely psychotic and unrelatable and unsympathetic. Fight Club overall could be viewed as a shallow, ugly, fairly sinister story so its reveal can't really "harm" it in retrospect in that regard, but Wilfred always had a lot of warmth and light-heartedness which could be killed in a pretty significant way when we look back. </TEXT>

Only when he kills Zod is there any response, and when you've watched him, seemingly, nonchalantly destroying cities up to this point, that response falls pretty flat.   I get that there would be, and needs to be, collateral damage with two superbeings fighting, but there were better ways to handle that while remembering Superman's characterization.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think for a lot of people it was the ridiculous, over the top destruction-porn that completely undermines the core of the Superman character. You knock such a crucial pillar out from under the character and it brings the whole project down and makes Snyder look (even more some would say after some misguided choices in Watchmen) like someone who glosses over or simply doesn't understand important characterizations for the sake of whiz bang visuals. Which then makes you question WB in their decision to approve his work and then hire him on again for an even higher rung on their movie universe ladder.

Marvel's movies can be flawed, but most wouldn't argue that their is a strong sense of direction and cohesion there and overall everyone involved has seemed to understand their respective properties.  </TEXT>

They don't necessarily *need* to, again, the best way to describe it for me was *distracting*, I just assumed they would have to bring it up. They rattle off directors and actors that are extremely obscure because they assume there is some familiarity with them for the audience because they enjoy bad movies, so to not mention a long-running, beloved show built around bad movies is just a bit odd. I was equally distracted for a long time by Amy Smart being in High Voltage, but thankfully they eventually mentioned that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This doesn't necessarily account for all of the decline, but most shows like this would follow the same pattern. The first season is going to be the most accessible so it's likely to grab the most eyeballs and then as the show progresses, it's only natural for the wheat to be separated from the chaff, so to speak...the show continues to whittle away and get the audience that is more dedicated to stick with it and see through to the end. Not that the show is flawless and hasn't done things to send some of those committed viewers away, but I think most serialized/quasi-mystery shows would have a ratings graph likes this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, it's very close and it might even tip more onto "bad" as far as crummy seasons of Dexter. Characters become caricatures and unlikable. Uninspired main plots...how many times do we need to see Dexter become close in some capacity to someone only to realize he can never be close to someone. Dull, forced side plots that are done out of obligation and not because the supporting cast is so interesting. Boring serial-killer-of-the-season arcs. And probably worst overall, the show was too cowardly towards genuine change and upset, if it was trimmed by a couple seasons and didn't have to spin it's wheels and leave Dexter basically back to status quo at the end of the season, it's legacy could've been much stronger. There were great moments and good episodes in its latter half, but when you average and consider the seasons as a whole, the show was pretty lackluster after season 4.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> God, this argument drives me nuts. There's a difference in giving into a fantastical premise and noticing and criticizing the filmmakers fucking up. Every movie gets harped on for committing continuity errors and logistical flubs like people have mentioned here. Being a sci-fi/supernautral movie never makes it immune to ANY complaints.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He didn't say anything about grammar mistakes, he was criticizing it from a songwriting angle. I agree with you oriss27, I had the exact thought about the crowbar line. I don't fancy myself a songwriter by any stretch, but I do have this nerve that gets tweaked when I hear lines like that that have too clunky of a flow or some weird peculiarity like that, totally agree that in this case dropping "stupid" would make it easier to sing the line syllabically and have a steadier flow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would chalk that up to music videos just not having the presence they once had. MTV is not thing it was in the 80s and 90s and the parodied songs aren't as strongly identified with the video in the public's mind as they once might have been. Personally, I don't know what any of the original music videos in the last two or three albums would've looked like. In the last decade, with YouTube, you've got live versions and TV appearances and fan made videos diluting the artist's output to the point that with a really popular song, a good percentage of the viewers might not know what the actual official music video is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, there's a short like you describe called The Lawnmower Man from the Night Shift collection. Some funny legal wrangling with the rights and wanting to stamp King's name on something led to the barely related feature film. 

There's a cheap short film of the original story out there too, it's sorta fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd strongly disagree, I never felt any of it was frustrating, I enjoyed just being able to spend more time with the characters in this format. Just because the story possibly **could** be boiled down to feature film length doesn't mean it **should** anymore than a book should only exist as a Wikipedia summary because it can be stripped down to a few paragraphs. The smaller moments and nuances are what really make a show like this for me, a two hour film would probably lose a bunch of the side characters and the story and town wouldn't feel as fleshed out as it did on TV. Endless isn't always better of course, a show could certainly spin it's wheels and get dull. But in this case, I personally never felt like the show was annoyingly being padded. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The marketing angle seems really dumb. Lotta new people gonna be hooked by the title change and check out a third installment in a series? Fans of the first two movies gonna be turned off by "There and Back Again" and possibly skip the last movie? 

I don't question that the marketing was part of the reasoning behind, but like a lot of decisions made on that basis, it's stupid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The movie adaptations aren't masterpieces..though haven't seen the older one since high school...but I've always really enjoyed the book "A Separate Peace". Dead Poets Society was certainly inspired by it to a certain degree, it takes place in a New England prep school and covers some of the same themes of seizing the day and dealing with growing and learning and death. It's written from the perspective of an older man thinking back in his high school days and I still get a little punch in the gut when I think about how well the book captures the bittersweet nostalgia. 

There was a movie made in 1972 and a Showtime movie back in the 2000s.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a tough one for me to swallow. There are plenty of zealots out there willing to die for their "causes", but I think it's harder to believe you could have one that was so brilliant and unflappable..or I guess such a good performer if he isn't actually as brilliant as we've seen him act and react. It's one thing to be someone's mask in a more distanced way, like working from the safety of recorded messages or something. But I think it's another to be out in the real world, for all appearances untethered from the "real Moriarty" and having to think on your feet in situations with real danger.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it's not a straight sci-fi/mystery show in the sense of necessitating answers, but they could've easily formatted it as a much simpler, absurd comedy and left out all the clues and hints to the greater mystery if they didn't have intentions of answering questions.
