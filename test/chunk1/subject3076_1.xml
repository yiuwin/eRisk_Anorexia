Well thanks for reminding me I am alcoholic. Spending too much time in my head the last couple days. So today I will show you what you hate, and focus on what I need to do.

Now you can properly go fuck yourself vodka. You're not getting shit.

	<TITLE> Week Two of Korte's 3x3...question on exhaustion. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-07 06:31:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Like the title says, I am into week two of [Korte's 3x3](http://www.deepsquatter.com/strength/archives/korte.htm)

I train three days a week, doing the big three. My question is, I get fucking exhausted after a workout. Like sit down, stretch, not move, chug protein. Then food, then I need a nap. Here are some stats:

Female, 27, 130 pounds.

Your Goals: weightlifting competition in a few months, get strong, learn the big lifts.

Any injuries or disorders that we should know about? I'm hypoglycemic and have asthma.

Do you smoke? Nope.

History of diet or exercise: Used to run a silly amount everyday, started lifting weights around 10 months ago. I've gained 10 pounds of muscle in that time. I have a personal trainer (will be asking him tomorrow about the exhaustion).


Do you have access to a gym? Yep, personal trainer the whole thing.

SO I do 6 sets of 6 squats (125 lbs) then 6x6 bench (80 lbs) and then deadlifts (135 lbs).

Before training at 10am, I have a protein bar, 1/3 cup oats with peanut butter (2 tablespoons), coffee, then I take pre workout. 

Is it normal to be this tired after? Supplements? More food? I eat 2500 calories a day on non training days and 3000 on training days (calculated I should be eating 2776 calories a day).

What gives? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys!

So, this year has been quite interesting so far. I'm engaged to a guy and I've become friends with a few of his friend's girlfriends/fiances/wives.

No one knows I am in recovery from alcoholism, except for my fiance. Not sure why, it's just never really come up. No one asks me why I don't drink.

Tonight I have a girlfriend over for dinner, my fiance was gone, and we opened up to each other. I told her about my alcoholism and the abortion I had in February, and she shared some things about her past. We really connected. And I'm so happy, because I'm going to be asking her to be one of my bridesmaids.

Anyways, I'm feeling relieved, excited and a little apprehensive. But I'm glad I said something. Her reaction was, "Oh, it all makes sense now, it all comes together." (referring to why John and I avoid bars and nights dedicated to drinking).

Anyways, feels good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two years ago I was getting drunk in the woods behind my parent's house. My liver was failing, I was completely addicted and in total denial. 

It's been two years of rehab, AA, group therapy, counselling, fun, laughter and tears.

Today I am engaged to the man of my dreams, healthy as heck and feel like a human being.

I don't know why I am posting this. As a young woman, recovering from alcoholism was tough for a lot of reasons. I thought I had a life of toasting and casual drinking ahead of me, but that's not my path.

	<TEXT> If you feel like drinking this weekend, read on. 

Two years ago, I had been sober for two weeks. At the start of May I was sent to a detox facility and managed to summon up two weeks at home. My parents let me go away for the weekend to Montreal, where my apartment was (and ex-boyfriend).

The first thing I did when I got to Montreal is buy a massive bottle of vodka. I then sat in a park and drank it, trying to pretend I was sober when I got to my ex's place.

That night I blacked out at around 6pm and went through the night partying. I lost everything I owned.

That weekend my ex boyfriend was chasing me around our apartment complex, because I had hidden bottles of wine around the house, in the park and around the building.

I blacked out for two days, straight. I got home, my parents were so angry and hurt, and I had ruined things with my friends and ex.

Two years later? I've got my health back. I had friends over for dinner. I live in a beautiful home, with my fiance, and we're planning a family. I can look at myself in the mirror. I do sane things, without forcing myself to. 

Anyways, this weekend is a big remember when for me and I felt like sharing.

	<TEXT> So, bought the Asus G75x two months ago. A couple weeks ago the screen started to flicker and I sent it back to get fixed. 

it came back last week and was working fine,  then tonight the screen started flickering again. 

called Asus they said ti send it back again. They wouldn't tell me anything about what to expect. I think it's probably defective. .. but they said they don't do refunds and that they would provide me with the best option once their technician had a look at the thing. 

What the fuck,  I thought Asus were supposed to be a reliable computer? 1400 dollar laptop that I Cant use. 

Anyone have any advice? There was no supervisor when I called do i am calling back tomorrow. ..fml </TEXT>

Just need to vent. I'm back to work full time tomorrow after a semi month off. Morning sickness, then dealing with an abortion.

I'm nervous about returning. I get these waves of emotions that are hard to overcome and smile through. I work at a big gym, I'm the lead CSR. basically my job is to smile and be friendly. I was told that I need to be on 100 percent when I'm back, or else to not come back. So I'm giving it a shot.

Anyways, life had been really rough. Its been so up and down. 

 I'm so grateful I can find moments of happiness and share openly about how I am feeling. 

Here we go. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Abortion Story </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-02-16 03:17:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello,

I'm one of your mods here at TwoX and I'm choosing to share my story about my abortion and a little about my personal life. I looked for abortion stories but had a hard time finding them. The one by 'leggomypreggo' really hit home with me and I decided to speak up. Because there was nothing immoral or wrong in what I did.

I'm 27, a recovering alcoholic and recovering from eating disorders. I'm in a loving relationship with the man I want to marry and we live together. 

I found out I was pregnant mid-January. My breasts were massive (ok, bigger than my A-cup) and my nipples were darker and bigger than usual. Very weird. So I was at the gym one day and decided hey fuck it, I'll buy some tests.

This pregnancy is a result of my poor planning, which is a result of my ongoing issues with caring for myself. I forgot to get my birth control shot. Something I rarely do. I thought the date was January 3rd (it was actually in December).

I took a test at the gym, and it was inconclusive. Meaning, it was a dud. I went home, and took another one. Jokingly saying to my boyfriend, "Hey I'm going to see if we're pregnant". Chilled on reddit, went back to check, holy shit. That was Sunday.

I was absolutely shell shocked. I knew how, and why, but holy shit. I thought that years of poisoning my body with alcohol, that years of taking depo, would have meant years of trying to get pregnant. But here I was, pregnant.

My boyfriend immediately didn't want the baby. I did. It felt right. I felt like I had purpose. I felt like I had something to take care of. 

We thought about it for a week. I was told by my psychologist that it was okay to be "pre-decision" about it. I took a week off. Which is almost a month off now, I go to work once in awhile. But I found it overwhelming.

On the 28th, I made an appointment with the Morgentaler clinic. Their next appointment was February 14th. Valentines Day. Hilarious. I was just getting things lined up. I didn't know what I wanted to do. My boyfriend said if I decided to keep the baby, we would. 

I literally went back and forth so many times. Check my post history and you'll see how divided I was. 

On January 31st, I had my first appointment with my doctor for a prenatal. I wanted to do the right things incase we went through with the pregnancy. The next day I had my first morning sickness, and it didn't stop until today (abortion was yesterday, the 14th). It was brutal. I missed work, had no energy, had crazy mood swings, the whole nine yards.

What made me decide to have the abortion? I realized that I was doing it for the wrong reasons. I mentioned earlier how I felt like I was finally taking care of something, I had a purpose. But, I have a purpose. And I have something to take care of: myself. And my purpose, my career path, that's all still unrealized. I spent my 20's in a drunken haze. I've been sober almost 21 months, but still haven't even begun to live the life I want to live, be the woman I want to be. 

I had a choice, and I chose myself and my relationships.

The abortion was scary. I wasn't allowed to eat before, and my appointment was at 1pm. I went to the gym in the morning to do a light workout, and drank a bunch of apple juice. Packed a little lunch. Boyfriend drove us downtown. The clinic was...amazing. I can't tell you how comfortable I felt. The guy at the front desk knew how nervous I was and immediately told me that these guys were the best. 

I filled out paperwork, answered routine questions. Then I went to see their intake worker, who basically just gave me something to read and then I waited again to see the counsellor. She asked me about my decision, about what form of birth control I was going to use, answered all my questions, and calmed me down. 

Then I waited a bit longer, and was called into ' THE BACK '. I was told to bring a long sweater and a robe and slippers. So I was asked to strip down everything under my waist. Bunch of ladies were all sitting in the same room, waiting for the same procedure. We were sisters.

I saw a nurse, who confirmed the pregnancy. I asked to see the fetus. 9.5 weeks. I was farther along than I thought. Decision remains. I saw the little fetus. I can't wait to have another one sooner or later. Just not now.

The actual procedure was painful. I didn't take any narcotics because I am a recovering addict/alcoholic and didn't want any sobriety issues. It lasted a few minutes. Intense pressure and poking sensations. A nurse was right beside me the entire time. It was over very quickly. I looked at the aspirator and saw the little bag of blood, and that was my fetus.

I walked to the aftercare room, they gave me a heating pad and some crackers and ginger ale. All the other girls were there and we were chatty about how it went and just supported each other. The nurse was amazing. I stayed therefor 15 minutes, then got dressed, walked out to see my boyfriend and left. 

Whole thing took 1.5 hours. I was in pain for the rest of the day but mostly I was just emotionally...dead. We called the fetus, Lima Bean. And I was shocked it was gone. I had a warm home for it, and now it was in the garbage somewhere.

I read somewhere that the opposite of death is not life, it's birth. That being said, I am not sure if I ever had life inside of me. But she felt real. I feel empty today. And I know there is no right decision, there is no perfect healing process. But I feel...empty. My lima bean is gone. Anyways that's my story.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am losing my mind. I haven't had a good nights sleep in two days, because I have to get up to pee every 30 minutes. Between 1pm and 10pm, I am so nauseous I can barely get out of bed. On top of this, I have a full time job I can't go to (bosses are getting fed up and asked for a doctors note) and I have courses at night I haven't been to.

This morning I had so much anxiety I got up and tried to drop my courses, but I won't get a refund. 900 dollars down the drain if I decide to quit.

Started crying hysterically outside when driving my boyfriend to work because I couldn't decide if I wanted to or not. I just can't make decisions.

I wrote some emails and called my doctor for the note, but man oh man, am I fucking crazy today. I am so sad, exhausted, confused, can't think straight, hungry but can't eat and CONSTANTLY HAVE TO PEE.

Can I please get an amen? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My first day sober I was confused and scared shitless in rehab.

600 days later?

I have a full time job at a gym, and I have friends there. I'm also well liked by most people (this surprises me for some reason), and don't call in sick all the time. I went to work at 6am. I worked out after my shift with my personal trainer, lifted heavy things and put them back down again. I no longer just run for extended periods of time and get obsessive about numbers and calories. I've gained 20 pounds since I got sober. And I am ok with it.

Tonight I went to my first of many classes to fulfill a degree in addiction counselling. I didn't realize how sort of...cool it was, that on my 600th day sober I started my career as a counsellor. 

This weekend I am meeting with a woman who will hopefully become my new sponsor.

Quite a change, in the external things. But I couldn't do ANY of the things I did today if I was still drinking...because I probably wouldn't have lived to see my 26th birthday, let alone my 27th.

Also on day two of cutting my sugar addiction...(FML FML FML)

I love all of you! </TEXT>

Oh Thou, from whom the breath of life comes, who fills all realms of sound, light and vibration

May your light be experienced in my utmost holiest

Your Heavenly domain approaches

Let your will come true-in the universe just as on earth

Give us wisdom for our daily need

Detach the fetters of faults that bind us, like we let go of the guilt of others

Let us not be lost in superficial things

but let us be freed from that which keeps us from our true purpose

From you comes the all working will, the lively strength to act,

the song that beautifies all and renews itself from age to age.

	<TEXT> Man, tonight I am so happy. I'll give you a play by play of my day, as it was a year ago, two years ago and then finally, the present.

Two years ago today I was definitely drunk already. Probably crying and attempting to hide being drunk infront of my ex boyfriend. I had been sober for three weeks until my 25th birthday, then went on a bender that almost ended my life. This was a dark time two years ago.

One year ago, I was 6 months sober (give/take). I was still adjusting to real life. I was a little freaked out, because I was to be moving out on my own in January. 

Today? I woke up happy, looked next to me and saw a man I'm falling in love with. I smiled, went to the gym, worked out with a girlfriend then went Christmas shopping for my boyfriend's nieces and nephews. I got home and baked Christmas cookies for 6 hours.

And here I am now, sitting and almost tearful. I am so grateful that the obsession has been lifted from me. I am free. I am happy. I feel rich.

Stay sober...I never thought this was possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The old woman I shall become will be quite different from the woman I am now. Another I is beginning..."

- George Sand

Change is constant. And we are always becoming. Each chance, each feeling, each responsibility we commit ourselves to adds to the richness of our womanhood. We are not yesterdays woman, today. Our new awarenesses have brought us beyond her. And  somehow, she no longer meets the needs of today.

We can look forward to our changes, to the older woman we are becoming. She will have the wisdom that we still lack. She well have learned to live and let live. She will have acquired, through years of experiences, a perspective that lends sanity to all situations. 

The lessons we are learning today, the pain that overwhelms us now and again, are nurturing the developing woman within each of us. If only we could accept the lessons and master them. If only we could trust the gift of change that accompanies the pain.

I am becoming. And with the becoming, comes peace. I can sense it today. I know where I was yesterday.

	<TEXT> The first week was the roughest. And then the second, and the third week it became more of a reality. I still have thoughts once in awhile, but the cravings have passed. 

My addict kept telling me I'd relapse back into drinking if I ever quit smoking. Quitting drinking was the hardest and most rewarding thing I've ever done, and drinking for me means death. So I held on tight to my sobriety, knowing one day I'd be ready to quit smoking. And that day happened.

My lungs feel amazing. My cardio training is finally being given a healthy foundation of SMOKE-FREE. And I feel like a whole person...smoking made me feel dirty and unhealthy. No more.

	<TEXT> ..and it was weird. I recently got a second job at a pub/restaurant down the road and was hired to serve brunch. Turns out brunch is really just an excuse to drink before noon (I would have liked brunch).

I felt pretty uncomfortable, I held it far away as possible from my bottom and treated it like a diseased cat or something.

I was told that I'd have a beer tasting sometime this week and told my manager I didn't drink. They didn't say anything. If my non-drinking is an issue for them, I have another second job lined up.

So yeah, smelled beer today. Saw a big bottle of vodka, touched a bottle of Jack Daniels. No cravings, I'm just being really conscious of what my alcoholic brain might start telling me. So I am keeping myself honest by telling the sub, family and friends in AA.

Here I am. Sober and employed at a brew pub. Sobriety you're crazy and  I love you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We don't ask much. These are the guidelines. Please follow them. Why? Because we're all human beings and deserve respect. I'm not perfect with this, I sometimes get heated and say things out of line, and I'll stop. But honestly, we need to get back to basics.

1. Speak from experience as much as you can.

2. Do not push your beliefs on others. Telling someone they will relapse because they do not conform to your sobriety is hurtful and confusing to people starting out.

3. This is a place to share YOUR story, YOUR sobriety and what has worked for you. So if you dislike a certain method, instead of just debating its pros and cons about it, offer an ALTERNATIVE. 

This is not a debating society. We offer stories, solutions, hope and reality.

Thanks and have a sober 24! Oh wait, Thanks for listening and in my experience I stay sober for 24 hours at a time. (See?) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My attempt yesterday to be a "normal" person. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-07-28 15:44:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So yesterday I woke up and was so sick of tired of being an alcoholic. I was so sick and tired of having to do certain things everyday to stay on a baseline where I felt I was comparable to other people's level of functioning.

I thought, FUCK IT, today I will not read my daily meditation books and do what a normal person would do.

I went to a meeting, hated everyone and everything in it, and told my sponsor it was a bad meeting. She let me talk. Then she bought me a milkshake.

I went home and started thinking about how my behaviour was totally setting me up for relapse. I wasn't being open, honest or willing.

I had two realizations.

1. Comparing myself to other people is just another way I stay sick. I have no idea what is going on in their inner lives, I have no idea what those people do everyday to stay productive, mainly because I have never asked!

2. Normal people probably do what they need to do to get themselves through a day. And therefore, if I wanted to be a normal person (whatever that means) it DEFINITELY means that I need to do the things that help me through MY day. 

So I read my daily reflections/meditations. I realized that I hadn't taken my medicine that day yet (talking, being honest, open, willing, doing the things I need to do).

Then I had a better day. I felt ME again. Me is working recovery, helping others, being honest, being open and being willing.

Just a little tid bit.

Edit: as soon as this list is set I will put it in the sidebar. I will also start to save all the AMA's and put them in the "HALL OF FAME"

EDIT: Tell us about you. Share your story. Share what you've been through. OR just say "Hi I am whoever, ask me questions." Personally I wanted to get to know everyone a little more, so I thought sharing your life with us would be awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey!

I find it pretty powerful when people share their story of recovery with me. So I had an idea. I thought it would be really great if once a week, we could get one of our SD'ers to share their story. It would be a weekly thing. Every Saturday, I was thinking.

So what do you guys think? I have no idea on how to pick who starts, and how to figure out the rest...but I think it's a cool way to get to know one of our subscribers per week.

Edit: The first person to be sharing their story is claybratt, on Saturday July 14th. I thought it would be fitting for the person sharing to "tag" someone else whose story they would like to hear. That user can either accept or decline. If that happens, we will figure out what comes next.

Looking forward to hearing claybratt's story. 

EDIT 2: THIS IS STILL UP FOR DISCUSSION ON HOW TO PROCEED! Nothing is set in stone and I'd love to hear some other options people have for running this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a long weekend in Canada to celebrate Victoria Day on Monday.

I always loved Victoria Day. It was "my day" or so I thought in my alcoholic mind. Every day was Victoria day when I was in active addiction: ME ME ME. Center of the universe.

Anyways, at this time last year, I had been two weeks sober after a long stint in a detox clinic and my Aunt's cottage. I was given 100 dollars as a gift for staying sober and went to Montreal to visit my ex boyfriend. The first thing I did was pick up a bottle of vodka and sit under my favourite tree in the park and drink.

That started a weekend I do not remember. I literally remember nothing from Friday to Monday. On Monday I thought it was Sunday, and my ex told me that no, I had to go home today.

I got back to Ottawa, stayed sober until the 27th of May and drank that night. Then went to rehab June 1st and stayed sober ever since.

Sobriety is everything. Everything else will come. Be patient. Trust the process. Don't rush your recovery, because there is no end-goal. Enjoy the process. It's beautiful, gut-wrenching, terrifying but god damn it feels good to be 357 days sober.

Stay safe out there this weekend and have a happy 24 my friends. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey yallll!

Was just thinking about gratitude today. Well, every day I do but today especially.

So what are you grateful for?

Here's my list

- My health: I am fit. I am no longer poisoning myself with drugs or alcohol. 

- SLEEP: I sleep very well now, without any medication. Never thought this would have been possible. 

- Friends: I'm making new friends in sobriety, and a lot of these people have never seen me drunk. It's unreal to be the sober friend that people can rely on.

- My family: they were behind me 100% and are still my biggest supporters. I'm slowly making living amends to them by living sober and showing up for life and being reliable.

- My partner Kevin: Has been with me through the roughest fucking time of my life, saw me through active addiction and now we're best friends again. I consider him my partner in crime.

- MY SOBRIETY: Holy shit. I quit my job as you all know, and my first thought afterwards had nothing to do with alcohol. I quit. My. JOB. And didn't think about drinking. I said to myself, "Geez what's the next right thing" and called my sponsor. Unreal.

	<TEXT> Hasn't hit me yet. I quit my job today. I wanted to go out with class and by giving my two weeks...but shit hit the fan at my work today and I just decided it was time for me to go. I work my ass off, for little pay, and the early morning shifts are fucking with my happiness.

So yeah...here I am. Unemployed. I have enough cash to last me a month, already paid rent for May. My sponsor and I are going to work on my resume and I'll start applying for positions.

And you know what...I didn't drink over it. But I did overreact. I was tired as hell, burned out and just didn't react in the way I wanted to. But that's what happened. I'll go in in a few days and make some amends...(although I am positive I didn't fuck up that badly).

In the meantime....meetings, meetings, meetings and step work. It's time.

Anyways thought I'd share. Didn't drink over a breakup not too long ago and didn't drink after a hell day at work.

So yeah: sober but...blah. Hasn't sunk in yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man you guys are all awesome. Thanks for all the support and kind words about the breakup.

Thought I'd give an update. I realized that looking back, I was getting back into the cycle of co-dependency with this guy I was dating. There was one time specifically after his last relapse that a voice inside my head said, "Victoria, get the fuck out" But like a good co-dependent and caring woman, I decided to 'stick it out'

I also realized I was minimizing his using. I told myself, well, he's not relapsing on alcohol, so I can have him in my life.

Truth is...lol, I am a fucking alcoholic and my thinker is still a lil on the broken side. I thought dating in the program would be awesome, and it might be for some. But two sickies don't make a well-y.

Saturday morning after the breakup, I went to a meeting...and got asked to speak at a two year celebration at the end of the month. I've never been a speaker at an AA meeting before, and let me tell you, it's a huge fucking honor in my mind.

Also, to reiterate Program_Buddhist: drinking would have made it all a lot worse.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was always a hypochondriac. When I was 13, I had a lump in my neck and thought I had cancer. I never went to a doctor to get it checked out. I thought if I lived five years, that meant I didn't have cancer. So I just went through the motions of life, extremely unhappy and scared.

Fast forward to the past two years. I convinced myself I had terrible diseases everytime I got sick. I refused to see a doctor and get any bloodwork done. I was horrified and scared about my cowardice.

It's one of the darkest things about my recovery. I felt like such a coward for so long, since I was 13. I am finally on board with my doctor, got a full blood panel done and a full physical. I'm healthy and clean! Although there was never really a scare that I wouldn't be...it's just facing it that was hard. So here I am. No longer afraid. 

I think that's been one of the biggest gifts so far. And it was all me, my program, my treatment, my sobriety. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey yall,

By the grace of (god) today I didn't have to change my clean date, but I will admit, I was the closest I have ever gotten to the thought of picking up.

Everything was going smoothly for the past couple weeks. Then today at work I am hit with a huge anxiety attack. I work at a breakfast restaurant, and my boss was putting in the alcohol order for tomorrow's Christmas party. It had been a busy morning with a huge reservation, and I had been awake since 4 and working since 530. I was tired, over worked (I do this three times a week and 4am is damn early) and I just broke down. Started crying while cleaning a table and hyperventilating. I overheard them placing the orders for the booze and were ordering "my" drink: the 1.5litres of wine.

I can't believe I lost it today. I thought my recovery was strong. But then I realized I had not been doing a couple things on my daily list. I stopped journalling a month ago when I started my morning shifts, and stopped going to my favourite meetings. 

I am just so glad I didn't have to really hit bottom before I realized I had to make some changes in my recovery. I called my dad (he works down the road) and he picked me up and I am now safe at home.

Lots of things have been going on, and I thought my life and recovery were ready. I'm moving out in a month, I was considering dating again...and those are all good things, but I know my recovery has been slacking. And today, I almost lost myself.

I'm scared guys? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello!

I had a curious thought today that I'd like to share and get some feedback on.

I've noticed that when I have dreams about relapsing, it's always a worst-case scenario. That is, I go back to the hiding, the secrecy, the lying and dishonesty that characterized my drinking. I'm wondering like...my addict has not become calmer. I don't think it has changed much. When I think about if I ever go back out, I have a feeling that my addict will totally take over again. When I hear about people's relapse and they just have one night of drinking or something, I worry because I feel that my addict has not changed...it's still the beast that it was before.

The difference is I don't live with my addict anymore, I live with recovery. My recovery voice is very strong. But my addict still tells me if I ever went back out, it would just be as bad. 

Is this normal? I hope I am getting my thought across in the right way. I know that this post was not me living in the present, but it's got me concerned, so it's worthy of bringing up. I'll be talking to my counsellor about it for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone,

Just because I am a mod does not mean I have a perfect recovery. I am writing this post because I want something palpable to help me recommit to AA.

I stopped going to meetings two weeks ago. I have a variety of reasons for this, probably most of them excuses, but I work four days a week at 5am, so getting to a meeting at 8pm is tough...I am usually exhausted and have to be in bed by 9.

I finally went to my home group to get my six month chip, and everyone was happy to see me. It felt weird going back, I'll be honest. I feel like I was missing out, I missed a one year anniversary of a guy I really admired, and just felt out of the loop. 

I'm not sure what the other reasons are for me not going to AA meetings. I am worried that deep down my addict is telling me I don't need the meetings anymore, and I know from listening to other people that not attending regular AA meetings is a huge factor in relapse.

Gone to three meetings this week. Feeling good. Have my treatment group tonight and called my addiction counsellor and set up regular appointments to see her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Six months ago I was a daily drinker, 40oz of vodka a day.

Six months ago I got angry and physically and emotionally abusive towards my loving mother who brought me into this world.

Six months ago I was scraping together pennies and loonies trying to save up for a bottle. I was stealing, lying, cheating and scheming every day.

Six months ago I was sad. Emotionally bankrupt. Not even a  human being anymore. I was a zombie fueled by alcohol.

People: It really really really is possible to get sober and stay sober. It's possible to have a fulfilling life.

You need to work for it. I was great at talking my way out of things and talking circles around myself. My denial cut so deep, it wasn't until I was in REHAB that I decided I was an alcoholic. 

I just turned 26 years old and I am six months sober. Will be posting photo soon when I get my chip tomorrow. I've never been so proud of myself. But a very REAL pride. Not a fake pride. Not ego pride. Just an inner contentment. Like, holy shit, I am doing recovery. For the first time in my adult life I am doing something I am proud of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love that line from the Big Book. It has helped me give a voice to what I feel I need to do to live.

Without sobriety, I am not living. I am in a world of torture and terror when drinking. 

Six months ago I was almost homeless, my parents being confused and reluctant to have me in their room, and my SO having broken off things and "kicked" me out of our apartment. I was drinking everyday, every morning, with no INTENTION of ever quitting. I was willing to become homeless and live on the street if that meant I got to keep my booze.

Now, I am willing to do anything and everything for my recovery. All the power your addiction took from you is power you can harness in recovery.

Turn it around. You have massive amounts of untapped strength inside of you waiting to be harnessed. You can get there, and it's worth it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Introduction of my struggles and recovery </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-10-22 22:47:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone!

I recently became a mod and just thought I'd share my experience with alcohol and my recovery. 

Without going in too much detail about my past, I started drinking alcoholically when I was around 21. I am now 25, turning 26 in less than a month. In the past two years, my drinking took the regular alcoholic course...drinking more, wanting more, always drinking to get drunk etc.

Around this time last year I was sober for a few weeks, but wasn't really going to any meetings and wasn't taking it seriously. I cried a lot, for no reason and hadn't realized how bad my drinking was.

Come December 2010 and into the new year, my drinking assumed monstrous proportions. Drinking in the morning, drinking all day, blacking out every time I picked up. In March, my boyfriend at the time kicked me out of our apartment saying he couldn't handle living with me anymore. He broke up with me a month later, saying I needed to get help.

I went to a treatment center in Guelph, Ontario called Homewood. I was scared but excited. My drinking was out of control, completely. It defined me. Alcohol was my god, my one and only, the only thing I cared about and thought about 24/7. It was quite literally hell.

Treatment was amazing. I loved it. The safe setting, the monitored meals, the constant face to face time with a group of people who I connected with. I quit drinking on May 27th.

I came back to my parent's house and am living here now, working as a waitress full time and saving money to move out sooner or later.

My problem was living sober, not drinking. Drinking was a terrible solution to my fears about adult life, my fear about everything. I was generally terrified of not being perfect, of not attaining all the things everyone thought I was capable of. Drinking was perfect because it allowed me to escape completely from the world.

I still have moments where I don't want any responsibilties anymore, where I don't have to be accountable for my actions. I still sometimes think how easy it would be to choose the alcoholic fate and live for a few more years, then just die...because life is "so hard."

My solution is this: live one day at a time. I have pretty severe anxiety and have been medicated through my 20's, but now I am at a place where the alcohol dependency has been removed, and I can consciously and rationally work through my anxiety, fears and depression. If you have a problem with alcohol, you NEED to get sober before you can really start tackling issues that may or may not be related to your drinking. Alcohol is like a massive eraser. It whipes out anxiety, fear...everything, it even makes time cease to exist and memories impossible to form.

I think to get sober, you need to either like the life you have sober, or really hate everything that comes from drinking. If you take away alcohol and you still hate life, you need to change everything. Because unhappy, dry drunks who aren't drinking will sooner or later go back out. Work a program, get involved with your community, go to AA. Fuck it took me ages to like AA meetings. I thought I was too smart for people in those rooms, too different to fit in, too young, too whatever.

Kill the pride. Accept defeat and find a new master in life. Alcohol will kill me if I pick up again. It's amazing what happens when you quit. This is the first time in my life that I have done something for myself, the first time I have been VIGILANT about ANYTHING. My sobriety comes first. It comes before everything else. </TEXT>

I was given a "recovery" token, meaning that I am on the path to want to change...but honestly this all seems way too 'religious' for me.

My health is better than it has been in years, I feel strong and alive. 

So my advice comes in terms of making new friends...or how to deal with older ones. I've noticed that in the past couple weeks I haven't been getting invited out to parties or asked to go out to my friend's houses for get-togethers on weekends.

My boyfriend and I live together, and he thinks that he is also being "shunned" in a way, from our friends.

I don't really understand. People didn't really like my drinking or how I acted when I was wasted all the time...and now that I am sober, it's seems that it's a sort of threat, or that I all of a sudden became boring or something.

Reddit, have you encountered this? How should I proceed? Obviously, going back to drinking with them is not an option...but is having a sober person around really such a buzzkill?

Edit: I just wanted to say, thanks to everyone who posted their stories, words of encouragement and to all of you who made alcohol-related jokes...I'll post another update in a couple months time...getting through my birthday, Christmas holidays and New Years should be...interesting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The text we read seems to be so much smaller compared to how we learned to write...why is this? 

I know that some people write very small, so obviously it is not impossible to have that degree of fine motor control over finger and hand movements.

I just think it's sort of interesting...any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to be 25 soon and I decided that enough was enough. I plan on abstaining completely until I feel like I can enjoy alcohol responsibly, but I understand that I may never get to that point.

I've ruined a lot of relationships, hurt people and hurt myself. I now have a caring boyfriend who saw me go from "fun drinking" to "afternoon weekend-drinking" and he is supporting me.

So Reddit...All my friends are out partying for Halloween and my boyfriend and I stayed in to study. Does it get easier to be around people when they are drinking? Is this ever possible?

Day 7!

Edit: Day 12! Still going. </TEXT>

I live in Montreal, Canada...it's around 5:30pm. 

I am either having some homemade burgers on the grill (rooftop patio) or I'll be baking some boneless chicken thighs, with rice and veggies. Boring, but oh-so-good.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yesterday everything was crystal clear and today my world is a little less crisp and I am having a harder time focusing. 

Is this normal? I got glasses two months ago, -1 and -0.75 (so not very bad).

Edit: having minor panic attack over what it could mean if my eyesight went from "borderline-you-need-glasses" to "you need glasses". I think after work tomorrow I will go see my eye doctor. The eye drops actually helped, and after cleaning them I found these little spots on the left lens that won't go away. Also, my vision on that side seems like it is "spotty" and I am pretty sure it's those little scratches. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am 24 and female. My parents have pretty poor vision and I always thought one day or another I would need glasses.

Two months ago, my vision started to deteriorate...I would have a hard time seeing text across the room on books etc.

Yesterday, I went to an optometrist, and was prescribed glasses for everyday use! To be honest, my world is a lot clearer and I am thrilled. The people at Lenscrafters knew it was my first pair of glasses...but didn't really give me any input on how to care for them.

So Reddit: got any advice for a first-time 4-eyed human? </TEXT>
