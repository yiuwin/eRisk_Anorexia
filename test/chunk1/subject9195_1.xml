	<TEXT> Hello good people of /r/Beginning_Photography ! I have inherited two cameras, and four lenses from my late grandfather. He love to shoot pictures, and I, though a youngin share his affinity. My uncle is coming out to Colorado for Christmas, and likely will want to take some gear home. In the kindest way I can say this, it is likely any gear of my grandfathers he receives wont make it to next Christmas. I'd appreciate any recommendations on what to keep, and (shutter) what to give away. (photo pun. I'm terrible) I will share what I keep with my father who enjoys film photos and landscape photography. I want to get into street photography, and I shoot portraits. I like the ease and edit ability to Raw digital

Lenses Nikon ED Af NIKKOR 70-300mm 1:4-5.6 D Nikon DX Af-s NIKKOR 55-200 1:4-5.6 G ED Nikon AF NIKKOR 28-70mm 1:3.5-4.5 D Nikon DX AF-S NIKKOR 18-55MM 1:3.5-5.6 G

Cameras Nikon D3200 (digital) Nikon N90s (film)

Tl;dr Find the stuff really worth keeping from above
