	<TEXT> It depends on how you are planning to do it. Are you wanting the image within a border or without; i.e. placed on the wrist as a square image, or more blended? Either way, the third and fourth are most definitely your most viable options. 

However, I agree with the others that nebula tattoos are more suited to sleeves or larger areas, as more detail than can be tattooed on a wrist is required to do them justice. I have found stylised designs normally work better on wrists, both for the artist and the person receiving the tattoo.  </TEXT>
