	<TEXT> I have a gold magneto that I would trade for the nautilus 
It's "gold" playing is rubbing off a little and it has 1 scratch on the locking ring 
I would say it's maybe 7/10 as far as aesthetics go but functionally it's 10/10  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to do the same thing! while driving, writing, playing guitar.... Pretty much everything lol

What if you took a ziplock bag, make a small hole in the corner (just smaller than the 510 drip tip connector), place the hole over your device with out the drip tip attached, and attach your drip tip (making sure the plastic bag is secure)? That should waterproof pretty well, as only your drip tip would be exposed to the elements. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say it probably is just a bad coil if it's that bad.
Although, protank 3's have substantially worse airflow than the 2 
I would get an  aerotank base for your protank 3. They're relatively cheap and the parts are perfectly interchangeable. 
The aero base will allow you to change the airflow to your likings and will help the cloud production.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would suggest buying a water tight container or just using those resealable plastic baggies and double bagging it to be safe and then vape when you're in a spot where you're not worried you'll drop it or get it wet. 
I've been emailing the makers if the life proof cases trying to get them to make some waterproof cases for ecigs, but I'm
Not getting much back.

I apparently get a little white girl wasted and me, being a blackout drunk, raised a little bit of hell. When I woke up at our hotel (don't worry wee took a taxi) I was wearing a girls shirt, I had a bandana on my head like Tu pac and I had a new tattoo. On my ass. Of a cat. With a top hat. And a mustache. And a monocle. So now being back in Texas I've learned to love my new tat and I've named him seor Bigotes or mister whiskers. I've shown him to maybe thirty people I don't know so far and it's great  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was having some problems with leaking at first but I solved that problem really easily... I got the longer coil for the protank and it stopped leaking immediately 
The mod is absolutely beautiful I have it at 5 watts and 4.3 volts... It produces clouds like no other mod under 100 dollars 
Far more sturdy than the e-Vic and much more functional and user friendly than the provari 
My favorite so far:) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> EDIT!!!!!!

Sorry everyone!! Too high! 
Forgot to paste the thing that I said! 

"I feel like my toes are in envelopes and they're each being mailed to different countries and the journey to get me back my toes will enlighten me, and I will meet my spirit animal in the tenth country, and we will have a spirit convo and he will be me and I will be him, and once I have my toes I must say the secret word. The secret word is...is saucemoagiane. The e is silent. The spirit animal will know it is time to put my toes back on when I say this word." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The other night my girlfriend, who doesn't smoke because of school, came over to my house. My roommates and a couple of friends were all smoking, but I decided not to because sometimes I feel bad being high around her all the time when she can't. 
Half-way into their sesh she looks at me and says "why aren't you smoking babe?" And when I told her why she was like "fuck that! Go smoke babe. Have fun, don't worry about me." 
So I got super ripped then we had sex. :) 

TH;DR my girlfriend said I could smoke even though she couldn't, got really high, had sex </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have extreme anxiety and have for five or six years. I've found that if you completely relax about the situation and don't think yourself into an anxiety attack because it's your first time or that you're smoking in general you won't have any problems at all. 
Just treat it like you're taking anxiety meds that are natural and enjoy yourself. 
Since I started smoking I have minimal anxiety even if I haven't smoked. It just kind of calms you down:) 
Good luck  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes but I'm saying you look sketchy as all get out if you straight up refuse a search and 100 percent of the time (in Texas at least) they bring the drug dogs. 
So I'm not saying you should say "oh yea officer get in and have a look. Take your time!" But you should definitely never make it seem like you have something to hide, that's always a recipe for disaster. 
I should have specified more.... But I'm not an idiot  </TEXT>
