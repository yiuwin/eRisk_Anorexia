	<TEXT> We've been the worst team in the NFL for 3 years straight.  At least the Browns almost won their division 2 years ago.  I see no progress being made from last year, except the running game and OL.  I see regression at every other spot offensively, and defensively we've played about the same as last year up to this point.  We have the worst coach in the NFL and that's not up for debate at all.  On the Music City Miracles podcast today they were talking about how it's a rebuilding process or whatever......we've been "rebuilding" for 5 YEARS.  At some point something has to change.  How do some of yall keep such optimism in spite of 5 years straight of horrendous football  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see people all the time talking about how we are building for the future but I don't see how the team will make any great strides from this year to next or later.  Murray, Orakpo, Morgan, McCourty, our FS, Walker, Woodyard, and a few more are going to be getting older and and losing a step.  Hypothetically Our OL could be the greatest in football (they won't be) in a few years but that doesn't always equal wins.  Our defense isn't that young and we have no WRs to speak of, maybe Sharpe if he develops.  Mariota could make strides but it's hard to do without legitimate weapons.  Based on our roster now (so not counting hypothetical draft picks) why will be any better in the future?  Explain to me why I'm wrong  </TEXT>

This is the original post.  Anyway my scans came back and I'M CANCER FREE.  I CAN GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND MAYBE PLAY FOOTBALL AGAIN.  My doctor said she'd never seen anybody be so strong during chemotherapy and still workout and stuff like I did.  Words can't describe how happy I am.  Praise the Lord.  Hopefully my hair and beard will grow back soon hahaha

	<TEXT> I'm really sad because I'm going to have to quit playing college football because I got stage 2 testicular cancer.  I'm done with chemotherapy but I might have to do radiation.  I have to quit because if I get hit down there I might not be able to have kids after all this and I don't have the stamina required to continue playing.  I'm honestly crushed, almost everything I did in high school on and off the field was so I could play college football.  I mean I have a 3.89 GPA right now in college so it's not like I can't do other things with my life but it just really hurts.  Sorry for the rambling rant, I just needed to get it off my chest.

I know it's not "real" football, but I was expecting a little realism and strategy, opposed to them just throwing it to Gronk and the same inside zone running play 25 times.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My personal story of fighting cancer and playing college football </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-16 21:33:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, my name is Luke Hillis.  I was diagnosed with stage 2C seminoma testicular cancer about 3 months ago.  I play football at Tusculum College, just a small D2 team in Tennessee.  I don't post much on here besides picking and joking around with Tennessee fans.  

I'm from Murfreesboro, Tennessee and fortunately I was blessed enough in high school to get some FCS and Division 2 offers from teams like Austin Peay, Chattanooga, Central Arkansas, Tusculum, and a bunch of NAIA and D3 teams.  Duke was the biggest school that for real for real recruited me but never offered anything.  Tusculum ended up being the best fit for me so I went there.  

I was redshirted my first year, which was disappointing but allowed me to focus on grades.  Going into my first spring practice, I was excited to show the new coaches what I could do.  I got into the 3rd string at my position, and my grades were great.  I was in a very happy place, on the field, spiritually, and in the class room.  

About a week after spring practice I started having the worst stomach pains I've ever encountered.  Long story short, I went to the hospital and they were about to do emergency appendix surgery on me.  But then they did a ct scan and told me I had two 7 cm tumors in my body.  One in my right testicle and the 2 big ones in my lymph nodes in my back.  I had a right orchiectomy in Huntsville, Alabama 3 days later.  Then the doctors told me I had to go through 4 rounds of chemotherapy to destroy the cancer in my lymph nodes.  If it worked I would be ok probably, if it didn't I would have to have a dangerous surgery to remove what was left of the tumors in my back.  They are next to my aorta so it makes the surgery dangerous.  

Now I'm in Houston, Texas getting treatments at MD Anderson Hospital, and my doctor is telling me my cure rates are about 90%.  I only have 5 more days of chemotherapy left, and then scans to see if I have to have surgery.  I have to take the entire next semester off to recover.  My teammates and coaches have been very supportive of me.  I have been able to stay semi active and still workout and run from time to time.  

Hopefully I can play afterwards again, there's injury concerns and side affects I'll have to weight.  It's a lot to go through at 19, but when I'm better I know it'll make me a stronger man.  And also it makes me confident because if I do come back and play I'll be twice as good cancer free!  Not to toot my own horn but I was pretty good even with cancer hahaha!  I know it gives me confidence when I read about Eric Berry and other athletes that got cancer too, so I figured I'd share my story too.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-07-05 04:56:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I play American football for a college team so I've never experienced being loaned out.  

Does the loaned player really care about his temporary team?  Is he there solely for personal reasons and any team success is an added benefit?  Does he stay in contact with his former coaches/teammates?  Does he care about his home club?  Is there any animosity because of being loaned out and thinking "They don't want me anyway, I don't want to play for them?"  If his home club wins a championship does he get a ring (or whatever the players receive)?  He's technically on the team so why wouldn't he?

Edit:  Thank yall for the responses.  I was really hoping to get a reply from a former or current player that got loaned.  I know a lot of American NFL and college players but no soccer players so I have nobody to ask.   </TEXT>

Outside of the 3 obvious ones in Texas, Florida, and California what other states could win it?  I think Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, and Ohio could all easily win the tournament.  

My home state of Tennessee would have a great defense but a bad offense outside of WR.  The core of a TN team is:

Jalen Ramsey
Dontari Poe
Patrick Willis (Still top 5 MLB even retired) 
Dont'a Hightower 
Greg Hardy 
Randall Cobb
Golden Tate 
Michael Oher 
Harrison Smith

I was diagnosed Thursday with testicular cancer and they told me it spread to my lymph nodes in my chest and stomach.  The doctors seem to be very optimistic and tell me in 6 months or so I should be fine after surgery and chemo.  

Earlier I said I play college football, I say that because like as an athlete I'm so used to my body being so big and strong and idk just superior I guess and this just hurts me a lot.  I don't know if I'll be able to play football anymore after.  Also I'm 19 so I'm kind of nervous what my girlfriend is going to think about me when I only have 1 testicle and stuff.  She said she doesn't care and I believe her but there's always doubt.  Im just really young and was on top of the world and now I'm not and I don't know what to expect or do.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there a gap in fan support from the eastern to western conferences? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-10 02:32:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are obvious exceptions to the rule.  Dallas and Colorado get terrible support and are in the western conference.  Orlando, NYC, and Toronto get great support and are in the east.  

Western Conference Average Attendance in 2015 - 22,244

Eastern Conference Average Attendance in 2015 - 20,902

That doesn't seem like a big difference but if you consider a couple factors it becomes bigger that it seems, to me at least 

1.  Portland and Kansas City would both have much higher averages if their stadiums were larger.  Maybe each as high as 35k.  

2.  7 teams in the West average more than 20k at games.  Only 3 east teams average more than 20k

3.  5 teams in the East average less than 18k.  Only 2 teams in the West average less than 18k

Fan support in general seems better in the Western conference too.  Not that SSS's are the end all be all of support (Orlando, NYC, Seattle) but it for sure helps.  New England, DC, Montreal, and I'm sure I forgot some other team all play in huge stadiums that are 85% empty most games which kills the atmosphere.  It seems like western conference games are usually way more hype, the crowd seems more into it, and the stadiums seem more full.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played Jalen Ramsey in high school, and let me tell you he wasn't just one of those hyped prospects that sucked.  Dude lived up to it.  I also played a true freshman starter on the OL at Notre Dame, who was a dancing bear, he blocked me all night.  I also played several starters for Tennessee, some were really good in high school and others were very overrated.  They were better than even though my ego says not because they play SEC and I'm D2!!!  I don't want to trash a college player so I won't name any names, because I wouldn't want anyone to anonymously trash me too!  I haven't played any big NFL prospects so far in college.  

EDIT: I totally forgot......my LT last year has a chance to be get signed as an undrafted free agent.  He's the best player I've ever played against by far.  Jalen Ramsey doesn't even compare, the high school version at least.  A starter on Tennessee's OL doesn't even come close, that I've went against.

I am very lucky and very blessed to be in my situation.  All that said these are my thoughts regarding paying players.  Most athletes, especially on the D1 level are on full scholarship (I was on a full at a 1AA school but life happens so I play D2).  I don't see why people think they, us, need to be paid.  We are getting the majority of our school paid for, if not all of it.  That includes food, clothing (some colleges), and many other things.  If me and my teammates can get by on half or 3/4 scholarships I think guys on fulls can as well.  It's not "slave labor" because we chose to do it and it comes with HUGE benefits.  Also, at least, at my school we work virtually the same and put the same amount of time into football as SEC schools.  There are several transfers from the SEC on my team and they say it's virtually the same as far as practice time, work outs, film, and whatever else we do.  Only difference is we don't play in front of 80k a year and we have a guy go to the NFL every 5 years instead 5 every year.  Those are just my thoughts, some of yall probably think I'm dumb.  It irks me when I see people on here and other places that try to act like players are being slaves or something, when we clearly aren't.  I'm living it and we don't need to be paid.   </TEXT>
