	<TEXT> Thank you for your long reply! I have been refreshing this page and I smiled when I saw someone had put so much thought into their reply. Thank you for the advice of doing the opposite- that sounds like a really good idea.

How do you explain your ED to your family? Because obviously what I'm saying isn't working or I think they just don't want to believe it. I think my dad is in a strong denial his child is so sick so he is angry at me. Does that make sense?

Deep down I think I know I will have to go to residential if I ever want this to fully go away. I'm afraid of being the heaviest person there. And yes, I am 23 so I could leave if I wanted to. Again, thank you!! </TEXT>
