	<TEXT> "They can counter anything" is often said, but note that countering means being on the defensive. In AoE, you usually want to be on the offensive, rather than on the defensive. 

Sure, the civ can counter well, but that means you will never be the aggressor, you will never exert pressure on your opponent, and you will not dictate the pace of the game. These are serious problems.

By the way, note that "cheap trash" is pretty much useless on a map like BF where you are never resource-constrained to begin with: it being closed means your farms will be fine all game, you have loads of wood available, and in the late game, your trade should sustain mass production of gold units. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The really annoying thing about mass huskarls is that the Goths have their army basically instant-ready when they hit imp. They can start massing huskarls during the late castle age, and once they're imp all they have to do is click up to elite (and get that last blacksmith upgrade) while they run over to your base. This gives them a critical time advantage, as other civs usually have to wait on techs that take much longer to research (siege onager, etc.) in order to stand up to the mass huskarls.

Thankfully, the goth late imp isn't that great (can be countered by siege, BBT, etc.). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mathematician here. I wasn't satisfied with this video because I was hoping for a rigorous optimization. However, I grant that this problem is somewhat tricky -- the fact that the efficient point to get Handcart is *before* wheelbarrow implies that you really have to solve two separate problems:

1. Assume you will get wheelbarrow and hand cart *immediately* afterwards. Solve for the point at which this is worthwhile.
2. Assume you will get wheelbarrow at some point x (where x denotes the number of villagers) and formulate an expression for the number of villagers you need to produce before getting hand cart is worthwhile

While the math itself isn't hard, there's a lot of subtlety to the problem. So, good on SotL for trying, but I think from a strict-boom perspective, this question is still open for an answer. 

For open, non-boom maps the situation is entirely different because the increased walk speed is much more valuable (as it allows you to rescue villagers from attack much more effectively). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Inca really aren't much of anything. The buffed skirm and slinger are useful archer bonuses, but on the other hand, the slinger is really quite similar to a hand cannoneer, and the Inca don't get thumb ring. In my book, that's not really sufficient for being an archer civ.

Them being called an infantry civ probably comes out of having a full infantry line and the Kamayuk, but then again, they don't have any useful infantry bonuses. 

I think the Inca suffer from the same problem as all the other FE civs: the developers did not want to create OP civs that would ruin the balance of the game (note that three of the most popular and strongest civs -- Huns, Aztecs, and Mayans -- were all introduced with the Conquerors expansion back in the day). So they stuck on the conservative side, and possibly with the exception of the Magyars, made weak-ish civs.

Thus, I think the Inca could be an infantry civ, if they got appropriate buffs that actually made their infantry useful -- but I think the developers were afraid of doing this because it's easy to overshoot the power balance and go from "good" to "OP". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you start a game, there are several options for the "Victory Condition." For exactly the reason you described, most players choose to set the victory condition to Conquest, which means that capturing the relics or building a wonder won't win the game.

Also, just fyi -- elephant archers are among the worst units to make. The Indians are generally a pretty weak civ, but if you're playing them and you need to take down buildings, I suggest bombard cannons. (Use hussars and hand cannoneers to protect them.) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Has anyone tried Mongol Rams + Teutonic Knights? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-30 09:48:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's an idea for a strategy I've been playing with. As you know, the TTK is the strongest infantry unit in the game, and is also formidable at razing buildings. The only viable counters to TTK are archers, gunpowder, and onagers. TTK's greatest weakness is their extremely slow movement speed.

The Mongol Ram is, thanks to the *Drill* technology, fast. Moreover, when you Garrison a Siege Ram with infantry, it moves faster yet. All in all, a Mongol Siege Ram with Drill and 6 TTK inside moves only very slightly slower than a Mongol post-imp cavalier. 

So here's a strategy for the early imperial age: the Mongol player gets Drill and makes lots of Siege Rams. The Teuton player makes lots of TTK. The TTK garrison in the rams, and the Mongol player delivers them to the opponent's base -- they have an easy time busting down walls and getting inside since they are extra-fast rams. Once inside, the rams absorb arrowfire and take down buildings, while the TTK also raze buildings, kill villagers, etc. Once TTK are in your base, it's quite hard to get rid of them.

The TTK can be re-garrisoned in the rams to move to a different section of the base once some section is destroyed, which should happen very quickly. At this point, the Mongol player should reinforce with hussars or cavalry archers: since they don't need to make very many siege rams, they should have a lot of resources.

I could see this strategy potentially being very strong in the early imperial age, as the opponent would probably not have onager, bombard cannons, or gunpowder units to use as counters.  The weaknesses of this strategy are that it requires the Teutonic player to have a very strong economy (to go imp, get the upgrade, and mass TTK -- perhaps the Mongol should sling a bit?) and above all, it requires extremely good coordination: excellent micro, teamspeak, and lots of practice, without a doubt.

	<TEXT> Their versatility is a bit of a false lead. They're very versatile basically only if you research all technologies and have plenty of military production buildings of all types, which is extremely expensive. Trying to use their versatility drains your resources in a way that is unaffordable at least in a 1v1. 

What makes the Mayans, Huns, etc. so good is that they excel in one field, and then excel in countering the counter to that field. This means that to have their ideal army composition, they don't have to make many buildings that will go idle, and they don't have to research many technologies. This allows them to save lots of resources, which they can pump into a stronger army. This is often the factor that gives them an edge. (Eco bonuses etc. aside.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difficult thing with this sort of question is that it depends on circumstances. Are we talking about a 1v1 or a team-game? Further, different civs have different advantages on different maps. There are few civs that dominate across the board.

I generally agree with ZeroEmpires' [Top 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq3xDMXtXnc) and [Worst 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpemawx_ExI) civs in AoE2, but I have reservations about this because, again, it depends on the circumstance.

Take the Turks. ZeroEmpires correctly identifies them as the worst 1v1 civ -- the reason being that they require an enormous amount of gold, and don't really get trash (neither elite skirm nor pikeman). This means that in a 1v1 game, they will almost certainly lose if gold runs out and it gets to the trash war phase. Their early/mid-game isn't strong either, it's really only in the early Imperial in which Turks excel, but that isn't enough to twist the odds significantly in their favor.

However: Turks are quite good in late-stage team games. So long as there exists trade to sustain their immense need for gold, they do very well. 

Anyway, I'll try to answer your question. I'll restrict it to The Conquerors. The Forgotten has some balance changes.

Best across the board are probably Huns, Aztecs, and Mayans. They are   versatile civs with very strong early- and mid-game. The Aztecs and Mayans both excel in the late game as well, though at this point the Aztecs can no longer compete on the water, and the Huns begin to fall a little flat because they rely mostly on CA/Paladin, don't get fully upgraded trash, and have weak siege. Regardless, any of these three civs can stand up very well under most conditions, in 1v1 as well as in TG.

Worst across the board are probably the Franks. Their knights are the strongest in the game, but aside from that, they have little worth mentioning. Their economy bonus is negligible, and it's easy for the opponent to counter knights. Then the Frankish player has few choices. I could see the Franks beating only perhaps the Turks (or Vikings on a land map) in a 1v1, and in a teamgame they are unquestionably much weaker than either of those (even on a landmap, due to the value of the Viking sling). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to Prevent Player-Base Fragmentation with New Expansion? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-22 02:25:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This fall, we'll get a new expansion: the African Kingdoms. The problem I see is that it might further split up an already divided base of players.

Currently on Steam, we have two versions of the game: The Conquerors and The Forgotten. There are small, but important differences between the two (more unique technologies, different unit costs, etc.). It is already somewhat challenging to keep in mind these differences when playing one or the other version.

With the African Kingdoms, we will likely see more technologies, tweaks, and other subtle but important changes to the game (confirmed: terrain will affect buildings). We will have three versions of the game, each with their unique characteristics. It'll probably be very challenging to remember all the important differences, so players will probably stick to playing one or two out of the three versions. Beyond that, some players will only buy one or two out of the three.

Thus, I think that with the release of the expansion, we may see some fragmentation of the player base, which could hurt the community in the long run. 

Thus, I would suggest including Forgotten Empires with the African Kingdoms expansion, and retiring the stand-alone Forgotten Empires. This means we would have two game versions available on Steam: The Conquerors, and African Kingdoms (including Forgotten Empires). This should minimize fragmentation. Note that keeping a standalone version of The Conquerors on Steam is probably necessary for the more oldschool/voobly crowd.

This is assuming that African Kingdoms be an expansion on top of Forgotten Empires (i.e. will require FE). It would be good if we could get confirmation on whether AK will require FE, or whether it will simply sit on top of The Conquerors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a reasonable review, but I disagree with some of the grades. The Indian navy is only missing shipwright, and is otherwise fully upgradeable, and is further aided indirectly by Sultans. In my book, it surely deserves better than a C+. I'd give them an A- on the navy.

Aside from that, I think the Indians are a severely underpowered civilization that shines only in a few particular instances. On land teamgames, they are good at countering the traditional knight/paladin play that dominates from the castle age onwards. However, they're possibly the worst civilization for a 1v1 landmap because they lack knights (so they effectively can't raid in the castle age), and because it's easy for the opponent to control the map with pikes + towers to counter camels. Even in a teamgame, they will have to work very closely with a siege/raiding-focused ally in order to succeed. 

Beyond that, the Elephant archer is -- as demonstrated -- similar to the War Wagon, except for that it is slow, which is a huge drawback. In light of its slow speed, it can be countered reasonably easily with halbs/skirms, and the Indians don't really have a good answer to halbs/skirms. Against skirms, the arbalests and buffed hand cannoneers are obviously not very useful. You could send in imperial camels, but that makes the army composition very gold-intensive. You could also use hussars, but those are easily countered by halbs.

Generally speaking, I think the Indians don't have a good way of countering trash-spam. Even though they are reasonably well-equipped to take out trash units, spamming trash is likely to be much less expensive than the trash-counters the Indians have to use (hand cannons, hussars). I think the problem with the Indians is that their army composition is somewhat awkward and lacks siege -- if they had the heavy scorpion, their elephant archer would be complemented immensely, and either the siege ram or the siege onager could make a serious difference. This would also improve their critically poor raiding (elephants are too slow, camels take too much damage from buildings).

But I'm not surprised that the Indians are a generally weak civ that is only strong in particular situations. Some of the strongest civilizations available -- Mayans, Huns, Aztecs -- were all introduced with the Conquerors expansion, and greatly shifted the game balance. I think the developers were generally conservative in their civilization designs for Forgotten Empires, as it's probably better to make an underpowered civilization than an overpowered one. That being said, I would support some buffs for the Indians (better siege, or stop classifying camels as ships so they take less arrowfire damage).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Elite Mangudai. Why? They have no attack delay. This means you can run in, immediately attack, and then keep going. This is excellent for sniping units. Beyond that, the fact that they're cavalry archers is very useful as it means that they won't be chasing after units. This is a big boost when hitting the opponent's trade line: if you send in paladins, they'll just chase after the trade carts and not actually do a great deal of damage. Mass Mangudai, however, will shoot down anything that comes near them. I think a large number of Mangudai can probably do the heaviest economy damage per minute because they excel at picking off villagers and trade carts.

Most other non-archer units are not quick enough at picking off units because they have to run after them. Non-cavalry units are generally too slow for raiding. So I would probably put Mayan plumes and Conquistadors in a reasonably close second place. Maybe conquistadors even deserve first place, since they're much better at taking down buildings? </TEXT>

Given that there are lots of TV shows which make similar guesses or predictions, it's not surprising to see one of them hit an event with a probability of 5.5%.

	<TEXT> I think it might be a close call, but my hunch is that Player B comes out ahead, especially if he keeps 3-4 knights alive. 8-12 villagers is a lot. Keep in mind that during this time, player B will also have had the opportunity to keep up villager production from his TCs. Player A, however, will have idled more villagers than the ones he lost (presumably has to garrison some in the TC), and loses resources from having to invest in a counter (get up two barracks and make pikes, etc.). 

However, I think the outcome of this sort of scenario really depends on how good player A is: there are players who can't handle this sort of rush and would get absolutely flattened/overinvest in defence, etc. and there are other players who would handle this without losing much more than 8 villagers: they would arrange their TCs to maximize protection by arrowfire, wall off their lumbercamp, etc. and generally minimize idle time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Running out of stone actually seems somewhat strange to me -- random maps are usually generated to have about 3000 stone per player, iirc. Assuming a 200/300 pop game, this gives you enough for 5 TCs and 4 castles. Is that not sufficient? If you really need more stone, you can buy some on the market, ask for a tribute, etc. It is unlikely that all players on your team (assuming a team game) will need all their stone, so if you are e.g. Mongols and you need to spam a lot of Mangudai, you can make more castles if your teammates tribute you stone. If you're wasting thousands of stone on walls and towers then you're probably making a mistake elsewhere.

Running out of gold is also somewhat strange -- most maps that aren't gold rush will have enough gold immediately accessible to you to carry you to at least 40 minutes of gametime. If you're concerned about your late-game gold situation, I suggest starting trade around 30 minutes. If you set up a good trade line (i.e. across the map with few obstacles) with your allies and gradually make 50 trade carts while you still have gold, then you won't be short any gold in the late game. If you're a particularly gold-intensive civ (e.g. Turks) you may need more trade carts -- but you still start out with more than enough gold to set that up.

In 1v1, the situation is a little bit different because trade or tributes are not an option. In that case this stage of the game is the "trash war" when you spam units that only require food or wood. You need to then use your gold strategically to purchase units that will make a difference (rams, onagers, trebuchets, bombard cannons). 

Also, do not shy away from selling your resources on the market. If you need to sell 1500 wood for 200 gold, so be it -- that's an expensive trebuchet, but sometimes it can be very much worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technically yes, but people playing scenario maps is not that common in the first place. I wouldn't worry about it.

There are certain scenario maps that are popular (Land Nomad, CBA, etc.) so you'll probably download one of those files. You'll know if someone tries to play a different version of the scenario because you'll have to re-download it. 

Anyway, this isn't really a concern. I've played a lot on Steam, and I've never run into this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Siege onagers with siege engineers have 8+1 range. Fully-upgraded plumed archers and mayan arbalests have 5+3 range. The fully upgraded skirmisher also has 5+3 range. Mayans don't get bombard cannons.

Consequently, your siege onagers outrange your opponent's archers. The celt siege onager also has much more HP than a normal one. So you should be able to use siege onagers to slowly push forward into your opponent's base. Archers should not be a threat.

Your opponent will have to make elite eagles to take out your siege onagers. You can counter these easily with champions or woad raiders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there! If you're new to the game, you may find multiplayer a little discouraging -- lots of the people playing on multiplayer have already played for hundreds of hours. There are a couple things you should do to practice:

* In the very start, do the campaigns and play a lot of games against the computer. This will help you get the hang of the game mechanics and give you a feel for the units.
* Watch the [Dark Age Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BJvtDLSkoQ) to learn how to play the Dark Age properly. The other Zero to Hero tutorials are also all quite good, and worth watching.
* The [Fast Castle Knight Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJSSQn6-DW0) is also worth understanding.
* I generally suggest watching a lot of videos of pro play -- you'll notice that there's a pretty standard form to playing the early game. You'll go far by just understanding that early-game form (i.e. learning to play a feudal rush or the fast castle). 
* Finally, learn hotkeys and generally how to play quickly (for example, using shift to create multiple buildings at once). This is paramount if you want to advance -- this game really comes down to how much stuff you can do in a minute. Learning to play with hotkeys will increase your play speed *enormously*.

Once you can beat the computer on a random map with reasonable ease, then you're probably ready to hit multiplayer. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got through all 2979 comics so far, and I noticed that Jeph sprinkles references to music and other pop-culture *everywhere*. He seems like the sort of guy to put in easter eggs and other little surprises for the astute reader, so: what have you found that others might not have noticed? What are your favorite easter eggs or subtleties in the comic? </TEXT>
