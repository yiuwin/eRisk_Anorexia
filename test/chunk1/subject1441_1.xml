	<TEXT> Right, which is why I said those people would stopover in the US.  WA to Northern Africa (maybe Morocco) to London/ Paris/ Frankfurt to JFK/ATL/MIA would be my best guess as to the course these people would take.

I much prefer the unlikely scenario of a cluster of cases in any city in the US to a cluster in some poor slum in Brazil.  This has nothing to do with political correctness and everything to do with strength of the healthcare system and ability to accurately and rapidly identify the symptoms.

	<TEXT> Most of the mutations have been silent mutations though according to RNA sequence analysis, so that's a misleading statement.

Also, there are parts of every virus that are stable enough to target for vaccine production.  The trouble with Ebola is that it is hard to weaken the virus sufficiently to keep it from making the person sick while still having the ability to stimulate an effective immune response.  So in that sense, I agree that we shouldn't be holding our breath for an outbreak ending vaccine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those countries are fairly liberal with their asylum policies.  People are currently fleeing there for non-Ebola regions but that could change.  Many flights from WA to south america include connections at some point through the US.  That would change with a travel ban but not deter desperate people.  With or without Ebola.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the benefit of not banning travel is that people are more trackable.  Travel bans would drive people underground and make it harder to identify potential cases.   I heard somewhere on here that we are already seeing some refugees fleeing the area for parts of Central and South America, namely Brazil.  Not sure if that's true or not, but if that were to become a widespread thing due to lack of legal means of fleeing the desperation and destruction, we could have a problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I should specify that I mean quarentine measures in general and not new knowledge about Ebola. 

Quarentines were enacted against Asians in San Fransisco back in the day because we believed that they specifically were responsible for a black plague outbreak.  Irish individuals in Boston were accused of causing Typhoid and were purposefully quarentined.

I'm not accusing the new measures or racism or any sort.  My point with those examples is that quarentine laws in the country are ancient.  They were made before germ theory was truely understood.  I believe they should be revisited and revised before we start citing legal precedence in this case.  Disease knowledge and the times in general have changed. </TEXT>

First, he caves to pressure from Astorino who's only real ability to challenge Cuomo is by criticizing his handling of Ebola.  Now, he's facing criticism from de Blasio for making fear motivated decisions so he switches back to stay in favor of NYC residents.  He'll still easily win the race- and would have even if he had not initially followed Christie or subsequently changed his policy- but it's still eye opening to say the least.

	<TEXT> First off, what do you mean by stronger?  Stronger for a virus is not a scientific term and it sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel.  Are you suggesting that this strain of the virus is more resistant to sanitation?  Is more virulent?  Has a higher mortality rate?  You cannot use general terms such as "stronger" when discussing infectious disease.  Where did you get your "1 in 10,000 chance"?  I haven't heard that statistic before.  What do you mean by taking root?  You mean it entering the country and spreading within a family and a community from one person?  You mean happening what did not happen in the Duncan case?

In terms of your proposed comfortable leper colony, I'm pretty sure that's not legal.  I'm not sure where you would find adequate staff to fit your description for one.  And two, how are you going to encourage these people to break away from civilization in the prime of their lives for an unspecified period of time?  You could pay them a hefty bonus I suppose, but who is going to fund that?  Who will pay for all of the comfortable quarantines these people will need?

We don't need to restrict who cares for Ebola patients in the US; we need to train medical personnel better to handle infectious diseases such as Ebola.  There are other diseases which are more infectious than Ebola despite having a lower mortality rate, and the US healthcare system would benefit greatly from having higher infection control standards in hospitals.  The training would not be a waste of time or resources because it could potentially decrease the rate of transmission of nosocomial infections and superbugs in hospitals.

People with Doctors Without Borders are falling ill because of lack of volunteers in the area.  Doctors are working in low quality facilities in the heat, and they are treating hundreds of patients during 36 hour shifts.  That is not the situation in America.  It is possible that this strain is a more "dangerous" one so to speak, but tired and overworked individuals are bound to make mistakes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/17/news/un-ebola-funding/

In this article here, the UN asks for money to give to the WHO to help fight Ebola.  Notice that the US is not listed anywhere as donating money because the proposition to contribute financially was blocked.  

http://www.voanews.com/content/us-ambassador-to-un-heads-to-ebola-stricken-west-africa/2496854.html
In this article (about halfway through), the African Governance Initiative (AGI) is urging countries to continue sending volunteers.  It is noted that military are going in there to build hospital facilities but that means nothing without trained medical personnel to staff them.  He goes so far as to argue that this is necessary to help control the outbreak (which is my standpoint).  Note that this article also quotes Dr. Fauci in the beginning who is concerned that the new quarantine will deter American volunteers (another standpoint I agree with).

http://www.english.rfi.fr/france/20141024-france-calls-volunteers-help-ebola-hit-countries
Here, France is urging more volunteers to head to Africa.  While it's not the US, it's still a major first world nation.

Are NGO's getting overwelmed and tired?  Yes.  But this doesn't mean that they want to pullout medical volunteers and send in troops.  They need more money and more people so that one doctor isn't stuck working 36 hour shifts with 100 patients.  The way to protect Americans on US soil from Ebola is by sending medical volunteers to treat the issue at its source and stamp it out of WA.  My mom is in the process of looking into becoming a volunteer, and there is no shortage of organizations who are willing to send her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was not reading anything remotely dense or scientific 10 years ago, so maybe you have something there, but is it really out of the realm of possibility that they have gained knowledge about the disease in the past ten years to allow them to have revised guidelines?  So far, the virus has been doing exactly what they said it would.  It's just infecting under trained health care workers who work directly with Ebola patients.  No one of the general population has contracted the disease through casual contact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not true at all.  The senate blocked Obama's proposition to donate money to the WHO which asked for 1,000,000,000 dollars to help control the outbreak and stymie the exponential growth.  They have received 100,000 dollars so far... from Columbia.  The US, meanwhile, has spent nearly a million dollars bombing ISIS in the past two weeks.  It is true that some volunteers are being sent from the US, but that will probably decline in light of recent quarantine measures created in the past 24 hours because people are going to be afraid that if they leave, they won't be allowed back in the US or will be shunned out of fear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, the CDC is a scientific organization; they do not exist to diagnose people over the phone.  I agree that they should be blamed for screwing up in the case of Vinson.  But, at the same time, this woman knew that she was running a fever and had just been treating an Ebola victim, so she too is at fault.  

The hospital was not sent "bunk instructions".  Those were the accepted guidelines at the time.  They have since been changed.  Other changes have been made to aspects of handling Ebola in the US as well, and that, in my mind, is what makes the CDC a functioning unit.  The fact that they are changing their protocols in light of new evidence and gained experience is promising to me and does not reflect incompetence but rather lack of experience.  Which is acceptable in my mind because the US has not been faced with a disease such as Ebola in its entire history.  This is similar to the way improvements in airplane security come about.  Disaster strikes, the FAA learns from the problem and implements a solution.  That is how the world works.

I am livid about the way the rest of the US government is handling the situation, but I believe that the CDC is learning from their mistakes and making scientifically sound corrections but not caving to the Feabola that the general population seems to insist on spreading. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree completely.  I have not heard that from NGOs; in fact,  I have heard the opposite.  I think the military has no place whatsoever in controlling the outbreak.  Few of them have more than a high school biology class as a background for dealing with infectious diseases.  Furthermore, increasing the presence of white, American military personnel is only going to increase the levels of fear and conspiracy theories in the region.  If the military is to be involved at all, it should be just to build facilities which they are doing now.  I'm still not keen on it being the military, but that's my personal bias.  Nevertheless, we need trained volunteers to staff these facilities otherwise they are useless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The risk is astronomically tiny to the point that there really are more important issues to focus on.  Also, I don't think it would be that devastating because Ebola doesn't spread as fast as something like H5N1 bird flu does.  China has dealt with mass bird cullings but that would not happen with Ebola due to an inherent difference between the two birds.  You are looking at maybe, maybe, maybe a handful of pigs/ other animals becoming infected.  It would suck to have to kill them, but it is really pretty simple to control.

I will defend the CDC to the very end.  They are dealing with a belligerent American public that lacks scientific understanding and the media hell bent of fear mongering for ratings.  They have made a few mistakes, but they are actually trying and making scientifically sound decisions unlike the vast majority American organizations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> America- where we only care about disease when it's on our soil.  This article comes on the heels of the mandated quarantine measures enacted by Cuomo and Christie.  This will decrease the number of volunteers because who knows what policies will be changed while they are abroad?  It is not out of the realm of possibility that states start closing their airports to people returning from affected countries

Honestly, this is the true threat of Ebola- the western world breeding fear and not helping to control the disease.  This is how the outbreak will actually spread out of Western Africa as what semblance of a government and economy crumbles and people flee to other countries.  I have also heard that it is believed that many would flee to populous central and south american countries.  If this were to occur, I have to believe that the US would start closing boarders and/ or eliminating certain international flights.  Given the fact that we live in a globalized society, this has enormous economic and standard of living implications.

Basically, my point is that people are so hyper focused on the "threat" of a few returning healthcare workers while completely neglecting the fact that the outbreak is steadily worsening in Western Africa to a point where it could start spreading out of the area in a less controlled fashion than a few HCW's. </TEXT>

Additionally, while wild animals are eaten in the US, most Americans do not eat animals they find dead/ partially rotten on the ground because a dead animal in a sorry state often implicates death by disease. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difference is that it takes selection for those mutations to be significantly present in the population.  Sure maybe a handful of people are immune to Ebola, but that's virtually inconsequential.  Ebola is a zoonotic disease which means that it's host is not usually humans.  It has not evolved to spread well in humans (hence the fact that it hasn't spread from person to person in the US besides for healthcare workers).  Likewise, the we have not evolved -so to speak- to be immune to the virus. </TEXT>

And while this is a perfectly legal decision, it is a dangerous one in my mind because it is discouraging Americans from going to Africa and dealing with the outbreak.

I know it is often portrayed that way in books and movies (including the Hot Zone), but that is a tad of an exaggeration.  I loved the Hot Zone, don't get me wrong, but it does have a bit of a dramatization aspect to it despite its fairly solid scientific basis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point is that there is no need for it.  Ebola is not contagious in the early stages and enforcing an unnecessary quarantine just spreads fear and encourages, on some level, this unnecessary fear mongering that the public and media are spreading.  It makes no sense from a scientific standpoint. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No.  If a case were to explode, it would have been the Dallas one where the ER turned away a sick man who said he had just returned from West Africa.  He spent days in close contact with his family while highly infectious and was then treated in a facility where the staff was not well trained to handle any sort of dangerous pathogen.  No family members got sick- not even his girlfriend.  Only two people got sick and they were both healthcare workers who were not properly trained in decontamination procedures.  

One of those nurses flew across the country to spend time with her boyfriend.  That incident should be a testament to how difficult it really is to contract Ebola.  This man is going into a much better hospital that is actually prepared to handle him.  The staff has been better trained than those in Dallas.  The virus really doesn't live that long outside the body; anyway, he didn't vomit or bleed all over the seats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you have direct fluid contact with him?  If no, then you're fine; you may have a case of fearbola though which you might want to get checked out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem with that is there is no way to trace their passage into the country.  Yes, you are going to have people lie a la Duncan, but at least it was easy to track down the people he came in contact with.  In addition to first world medical care, what really separates this country from West Africa in terms of ability to handle disease outbreaks is contact tracing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was self-monitoring in that he called in and reported the illness when he got sick.  This guy did a service that most people in this country would rather cut off their own hands than do.  We can't expect them to come back to the US and just put their lives on hold for 21 days without pay.  Realistically, they should be quarantining themselves, but I don't see anyone/ the government volunteering to compensate them for lost productivity. </TEXT>
