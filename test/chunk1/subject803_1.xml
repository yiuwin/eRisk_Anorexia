	<TITLE> Suicide Squad's running time </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-24 15:25:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Although Suicide Squad being 100 minutes isn't any indication of it's quality - it's still a tad worrying.

There are 12 important characters (poor Slipknot included).


The Suicide Squad, Enchantress, Batman, the Joker and Waller.


I understand each character won't get equal screen time, however when you divide the duration of the film (1h 40m or 100m) - each character gets 8.3 minutes.


That may sound like enough, but when you add Harley's origin, Enchantress's past and Deadshot's daughter.......plus all the connective tissue......it is worrying.

Would they have time to explore these characters well enough?


Remember, these are important villains in the DCEU and will be seen in the future - it's very important that we get as much character development.....as other movies will only build on what David Ayer did with the characters.


Guardians of the Galaxy is a film similar to Suicide Squad and has a 2h 2m run time........

Deadpool, which I felt was too short, is 8 minutes longer.

It's just sad that almost 3 hours worth of content is left in the editing room.......I really hope the movie doesn't speed past important character moments.

We were all furious at what WB did with BvS's TC and from the looks of it......they haven't learned their lesson.

Now, that doesn't mean I'm not excited by what Ayer will deliver - I'm just worried....especially when you consider WB's long history of cutting Snyder's movies.

**Edit: This post is written on the belief that the film will be 1 hour and 40 minutes long. If this is false - the post is moot.**

**Another Edit: It seems David Ayer has denied rumours that the movie is 1 hour 40 minutes (thank god).**

**As stated above, the post is now moot**

	<TEXT> I found a copy of the "Batman: The Animated Series" writer's bible.

In it, it explores their ideas and the exploration of what should be in a Batman story.

Here's a snippet of what's written;

You can read the full document here (it's very long);

It would be really cool if some of what's written here is incorporated in the DCEU because it really seems they nailed the spirit of Batman and the DC universe at large. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-06-22 08:02:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've watched anime for a very long time - but I've become a lot more annoyed with how male anime protagonists act in front of women.

Is it something specific to the Japanese culture?

Other than a few unique male leads, the majority seem to be asexual/absolutely unaware, afraid of women or both.

I'm not saying that they need to be sexually open, but in 2016 - they should have a more "solid" character that doesn't always run away or accepts getting hit or harassed (I understand it's tsukkomi).

You can easily write a strong male virgin/innocent character that has all the likeable traits of a lead but doesn't lose it after seeing cleavage or allow himself to be trampled on.

TLDR; Is the typical male protagonist used in the majority of harem and romance anime a result of culture or just adhering to the usual tropes?

What would you do if you were given free reign to change the character of a male lead?

Similar to Nick Fury's role, but more a member than a leader.

When the JL is busy, someone needs to take care of Justice League affairs, and since the DCEU has no Martian Manhunter........

What would you want Gordon's role to be?

Edit: I understand he's the commissioner, but it could be interesting for him to accept a more "lucrative job"....essentially becoming a vigilante and helping stop even more crime than before. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Cinematographer vs Director </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-20 16:46:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After GoT's amazing episode, a lot of people have praised Fabian Wagner for his work.

However, I hope people realise that the reason the episode was so amazing was because of the amazing work of Director Miguel Sapochnik and the showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benniof.

WB having Fabian as the cinematographer of Justice League is great, but it doesn't guarantee a better film, as some here might think.

The cinematographer (aka the director of photography) is the head of the camera and lighting crew. He works side by side with camera operators, camera assistants, gaffers, and the light and grip crew.

The director would tell the cinematographer what his vision of the film will be. The cinematographer makes that happen visually. He is in charge of making the lighting and composition of the scene reflect the director's vision.

TLDR; 

- The Cinematographer is important in filming but the quality of a show/film is reliant on how good the storyboard and the direction/editing is. 

- Fabian is a great cinematographer who films beautiful scenes but the credit for the amazing battle has to go to the show-runners/executive producers and the director of the episode.

	<TEXT> Why did Snyder decide to use no dialogue in the scene?

Jeffrey Morgan and Lauren Cohan are famous actors that could've added to the emotion of the scene. 

The scene would've played out in the same way, but with Thomas and Martha talking with their son and each other. 

That extra thirty seconds could've added to not only their character (in case of flashpoint/flashback) but to also magnify the tragedy that has befallen young Bruce.

The scene is already emotional, but I feel it could've been elevated.

Speaking of "elevated", the scene would also be a lot better if there was no floating in the bat cave. A normal nightmare recollecting the real event would've sufficed.

	<TEXT> After ten years of conditioning, the general public have gotten used to waiting for a scene after the credits. Many movies now use it to set up the next movie/sequel.

Marvel/Disney and Fox both use post credit scenes - I think WB should join the fray.

Sometimes there are scenes, that are not related to the actual movie but are needed to establish the next film.

If the JL cameos were added while the credits were running.....it would have been received better and it would have avoided the unnecessary scene in the movie.

WB could even set itself apart with a 10 minute epilogue at the end of their films......

	<DATE> 2016-06-08 11:15:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Not because of the Director, Patty Jenkins is a solid Director.

It's Wonder Woman herself that I'm more worried about.

Gal Gadot has been in a few movies; the Fast and Furious franchise and Triple9 being her most prominent filmography.

In those movies, her acting has been serviceable/mediocre.

In BvS, Wonder Woman was the surprise of the movie. However, it was the action scenes and not her acting that was endearing to audiences.

Gal Gadot/Wonder Woman was in the movie for only seven minutes - with 20 lines of dialogue. While that may not be a problem (she was a cameo).....it becomes worrying when you realise Gadot has to lead a whole movie.

I am afraid her supporting cast, who are all much better actors/actresses than her - could steal the show away from the protagonist.

Fans here have loved the addition of WW in BvS, but was it the epic action scenes or her acting that made you like it?

It's easy for directors to turn good actors/actresses into wooden caricatures.

It's hard for a director to turn a mediocre actor/actress into an amazing one.

I hope the movie makes us love the character of Wonder Woman.

I also hope to GOD they don't resort to the "male audiences hate female leads" if the film is not received well........I hope they learned their lesson from Ghost Busters.

	<TEXT> Even though Man of Steel was 3 years ago, the ending fight between Zod and Clark was amazing. 

Metropolis was a very concrete background. You felt like they were fighting in a real city. It never felt "fake" to me (except a couple of shots with bad CGI).

The Doomsday fight was full of dust, fire, explosions, orange light......so much effects that the fight didn't "feel" real.

It's really hard to explain, but the Doomsday fight is such a shift tonally from the realistic fighting throughout the film that it didn't fit at all. </TEXT>

The Wayne family existed since the 18th Century.

Winslow Wayne who fought besides Theodore Roosevelt, Silas Wayne who was friends with Benjamin Franklin - the Wayne family has built wealth, power and connections for centuries.

The severity of the situation Bruce has led himself in - where he is on a suicide mission which can destroy the entire Wayne lineage.

Alfred feels responsible for the death of Thomas and Martha - but also feels obligated to help the man that has warded Gotham's demons for twenty years.

Man, I finally understand why he wanted Bruce to have a child so desperately.....

God damn it - it's lines like this that you don't take out of the theatrical cut. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm starting to believe the rumours about Jason Todd. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-01 10:26:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This sub hates the Jason Todd = Joker theory, but the more I think about it - the more legitimate it becomes to me.

Firstly, let's acknowledge that this is a **theory** - and should be debated civilly.

Secondly, the DCEU is very unpredictable - Superman is dead, Batman kills and Alexander is the son of the original Luthor. 

Snyder and WB are not afraid of making controversial decisions for the cinematic universe.

I will list my reason for why I think the rumour is actually very interesting.

- Bruce has been Batman for over twenty years, and in most comic books - the Joker is one of the first few villains he encounters. This would mean the Joker is around the same age as him.

- Ben Affleck is 43 and Jared Leto is 44. However, Affleck has been aged  in the movie while Leto was allowed to keep his youthful look.

- Bruce's quote; "twenty years in Gotham, how many good guy are left, how many stayed that way". Harvey is not the only person he's talking about.

- The J tattoo on his face, similar to the carved J of Jason in Arkham Knight

- [The gun shot on both the Joker and the Robin suit being identical](http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/08/19/10/joker.jpg) 

- The fact that this Joker is inspired by drug cartels and kingpins, somebody who cares less about chaos than consolidating his power and being a nuisance for police/Batman.

- The fact that he's alive. Bruce has no issues with killing, so it's odd that the Joker is still very much alive. It also could explain Batman's treatment of Harley....probably thinking it's his fault she became that way.

- The Joker card on Knightmare Batman's gun. The arrival of Darkseid could mean that Jason decided to be good again and died.....Bruce honouring him with the sign of his enemy and friend.

- "The Fever, the Rage, the Feeling of Powerlessness that Turns Good Men Cruel" - what happened to Jason for him to turn like that.

- Bruce looking at Robin's suit might be a way for him to remind himself that if he goes even further....he would also turn like him.

- Snyder loves Frank Miller, "The Dark Knight Strikes Again" is a story written by him where Dick Grayson is the second Joker

- The revelation in Rebirth that there is more than one Joker.

- The tattoos would make even more sense, covering himself with what made him that way.....the original Joker.

How would the story play out for Jason Todd to be the Joker?

The original Joker created a video where he beat Jason to death - and then burned the Wayne Manor down with the Robin suit.

Bruce saw the video and the suit and thought he died......but he was not killed.

Similar to the Arkham Knight - the Joker continued torturing Jason for over a year....turning him mad.

The Joker went off the radar, but after a year - Batman found him and killed him in rage.......the GCPD find the dead Joker and assume it was another criminal that killed him.

Jason Todd becomes a criminal and after enjoying himself....decides to "baptise" himself in the ACME acid.

The original Joker got what he wanted, another Joker to take his place.

Jason/Joker hates Bruce for abandoning him and kills people left and right in spite.

Batman found out too late and now has to live with the fact that the Joker is his former disciple.

To other criminals and the GCPD, it's as if the Joker is immortal.

It would make sense that Harley would be attracted to this younger Joker, and Jason also giving her the ACME treatment so that they could escape reality together.

Think about it this way, if BvS is in modern times (2016), it means that Batman was operating since 1994. Does this Joker look like a criminal that has been operating since the 90s?

Even if the address is on the news, Clark shouldn't have knowledge of Mexican suburbs.

Did he use Google Maps?

EDIT: Everybody is talking about his super senses - but there are thousands of noises, cries for help and sounds (cars, buses, people).......how would he be able to differentiate them all? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love CHM but I think we should give the new Top Gear a chance. It took the second version of Top Gear (with Clarkson) a year or so before they settled down and became the show we all love.

Chris Evans drives me mental but [Matt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4mhMqOZ-Ho), [Sabine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KiC03_wVjc), [Chris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hTLk1rU_ZI) and [Rory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXTvtzRJvOg) 

They all have the charisma to carry the show.

Hopefully we'll get better than this episode </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WB will ever create a second Earth where the characters are a lot younger and played by different actors?

After twenty years and the current cast have become old....it would be an interesting experiment.....and one that could work.

Having Batman be a 28 year old who has just come back from training, a 24 year old Superman etc.

It would also be a great place to use very obscure characters or even create new ones.

The current universe would still exist and it would be cool to see the characters from Earth 2 interact with Earth Prime characters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DC comics is going through a honeymoon phase at the moment, with everyone in love with Rebirth. On the other hand, the DCEU is rife with controversy - some feeling the movies didn't give the characters justice.

On the other side of the pond, Marvel movies are universally beloved, while Marvel comics decided to turn [Captain America into a Hydra agent](http://www.gq.com/story/captain-america-villain) - turning fans against them.

That's not going to happen - please do not give yourself false hope of that....the Superman in the DCEU is very different and it's likely you won't see that rendition.

	<TEXT> Darkseid is one of the most powerful villains in the DC universe.

His Omega Beam is so powerful, they disintegrate everything in it's vicinity and follows the intended target until it hits.

I'm afraid the DCEU will make the same mistake as some animated movies - where the beam is powerful when killing civilians but doesn't kill when hitting a hero like Batman or Superman.

How will they be able to show the destructiveness of Darkseid's power without dumbing down the audience? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, Batman kills - something we have debated for quite a while on this sub.

However, wouldn't that mean that Batman is being hunted down?

The reason why the police department tolerates his existence is because he essentially does their work and leaves them to do the processing. He has a strict code and officers trust and respect his presence.

 It's also why Gordon became friends with him.

One thing will never change in Gotham though - the corruption of officials.

In every Batman story (including TDK trilogy and TDKR) - the moment Batman is thought to have killed - every single policeman hunts him down.

Batman is a legend to the public and a nuisance to the corrupt politicians. The police department head would want the honor of being the first to catch Batman in twenty years - especially one who is new at the job and does not appreciate Batman's work through the years [(like Yindel from TDKR)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQhTKAj7XzM).

With Batman killing, wouldn't he be considered a fugitive?

It's Batman's no kill code which allows him to work outside the law and still be respected by it.

How will they approach this in the solo film? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A few fans here feel that Snyder wanted to create a realistic interpretation of Batman and Superman to the DCEU.

Those same fans chastise the MCU for feeling "comic booky", "generic" and having "nonsensical happiness".

I feel the opposite.

The scenes with Peter and Tony talking in his bedroom, the Avengers in the break room as Tony complained about the coffee grinds in the sink and Tony's speech at MIT are all scenes in CW where I felt it could happen in our world.

In my opinion, Batman v Superman did not feel realistic. 

We never see Clark struggle at his work like a normal dude, he's always fighting his boss and doing whatever he wants.

We never see citizens interacting with Superman except when he's floating on top of them, treating him like a deity (Day of the Dead), or a generic hate mob (Capitol Building). Hell, you never see Clark interacting with any of his colleagues established in Man of Steel.

There is no scene where Bruce interacts with his employees (he's a CEO) or acts normal (he's always in charity balls/parties, fighting crime or in his Batcave).

It's very hard for me to see the realism Snyder was trying to achieve - especially when the movie was full of overt CGI and heavily stylized set pieces.

I saw the realism in MoS, but I feel it was all gone in BvS.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Snyder is a divisive Director.

He has made both good and bad movies.

However, it seems when Snyder makes a divisive film, fans of his work decide to blame everyone but him for the audience/critic reception.

Some arguments I've heard inside and outside this sub always seem to push the blame onto somebody else;

- WB upper management is to blame for cutting the original cut of Snyder's film, let's just wait for the Director's cut.

- It was Goyer's script.

- Terrio did not re-write the script good enough.

- David Brenner edited the movie horribly.

- Critics have created a world where Snyder's work cannot be accommodated.

Even though;

- Snyder was the person who created a story too long to fit a 2.5 hour movie - he should've known from past movies that WB don't like allowing him long movies. Was it a way to get DC fans to buy the DVD?

- Snyder is essentially the father of the DCEU and overall architect - and therefore has control of the script. When considering Snyder's past movies - it seems the common denominator is him.

- During the period BvS was being made, countless comic book movies were released - changing the taste and expectations of the general audience and critics. However, this does not change the basis of Snyder's decisiveness. 

TLDR?; 

I'm curious as to why Zack Snyder is constantly forgiven for his film making and yet many directors like Michael Bay, M Night Shyamalan, Kevin Smith, Brett Ratner, Josh Trank and Roland Emmerick are not given the same leeway.

When their movies are decisive/bad - they get the blame. Not the writers, editors or upper management.

If Justice League is a good movie, who will be thanked by the fans? 

- Zack Snyder (Director)

- Inner sanctum (Zack Snyder, Deborah Snyder, Charles Roven, Geoff Johns)

- Chris Terrio (Writer)

- Fabian Wagner (Cinematographer)

- The editor (whoever it is)

- Ben Affleck (Executive Producer)

- Kevin Tsujihara (WB CEO)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Many on this sub know that I'm not shy with my criticisms of BvS.

However, something I appreciated in BvS was just how brutal Bruce was in the fight.

You see just how angry he is, just how maddened by vengeance he is.

In Civil War, [Ironman](#spoilers "finds out his parents were killed by the Winter Soldier. This led Tony to fight with Bucky, with Cap interfering and fighting to stop Tony.")

I loved CW but I felt they half baked Tony's anger.

Not because of Downey's acting (absolutely superb)....but the direction and avoiding the character from being disliked.

 This is a guy who's weapons program had killed thousands of innocent lives, he created Ultron who destroyed a whole city,  [](#spoilers "created Vision who accidentally disabled his friend Rhodes (War Machine) and was left by his girlfriend.")

I wanted Tony to just lose it, to stop caring about his suit and continue fighting even if he had no chance......as it would've contrasted nicely with T'challa's decision.


I just keep on asking myself how I would've felt if that happened to me - and it does not feel good.

Which is why I'm officially softening my stance on the "Martha" scene.

In my opinion, the scene was very badly executed - but I realise just how important my parents are to me and how much their death would effect me personally.......a 40 year old man would still have the scars.

EDIT: I am asking the question because there are a number of variables that could've changed the movie's quality.

- Changes to the script.

- Less editing or even a different editor

- Less or more Box office due to the release schedule

- Less scenes with CGI to finish the movie on time, would that mean less or no Doomsday?

Seriously, be creative guys.

This post is to discuss what could've changed the movie in the extra time the production team was given. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After CW was released, there have been people on this sub that are using the actions of Marvel characters to vindicate BvS.

Comments like [this](http://imgur.com/mrfTz8n) really dissapoint me - as if the concept of "different characters" is hard to understand.

Do you know why DC fans disliked Batman and Superman killing?

**It's not part of their character!!!**

Both Falcon and Captain America are war veterans and have never had a "no kill" clause in their stories. 

Even then, Cap has not used a gun since Avengers and has continually used his shield as a weapon.

Falcon is a recent war vet and there is no expectation for him *not* to kill. You clearly see him use guns in CW.

Black Panther, a man seeking Justice killed **no one**.

Let me remind you, Batman is a man who's afraid to pass that line, that by killing - he would not be able to redeem his soul. Bruce is a broken man with a thirst for Justice.

Superman is an ordinary farmer's boy that happens to be an alien. Killing someone would be out of the question, due to his constant struggle in his young age and his good upbringing.

Zod's death, what was supposed to be a pivotal moment in Superman's life....finally deciding to never kill under any circumstances - is squandered when he kills/"pseudo kill" the terrorist in BvS.

So, next time you try to compare the actions of Marvel characters with DC characters - 

**think about the scenario AND the character**. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IKUNzGn2cc) video - a cool advertisement for "Independence Day 2" and remembered Man of Steel.

After the events of MoS, the world now knows it's not [alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnNsIqc3EYQ). 

Religion, science, politics and technology - they would all change immensely. It's something the prequel comics did amazingly, showing the world cope and companies like Wayne Enterprises and Lexcorp using the Kryptonian tech to invent new ground breaking technologies. 

Criminals would be using weapons derived from the remains of the scout ship, the Black Zero and the world engine.

I originally thought the reason why Superman hated Luthor was because of his attempts to inject kryptonian DnA into an embryo and create a human with the mental and physical capabilities of a kryptonian......essentially genetically modified humans.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice had the oppurtunity to essentially "go wild" and explore a world after a historically changing event. 

Countries fighting for kryptonian parts, and the increase in Black Market prominence.

Lex's search for the perfect human, is it immoral or can it elevate humanity?

Bruce's anger for losing his family/employees and his need to rebuild and establish dominance in the financial sector yet again (Wayne Enterprises financial division crippled).

The changes in military technology improved immensely in the US - UN council deciding the US needs to share so that all countries are equal.

World Engine rebuilt and used to create life on deserts - technology to stop Global Warming and help drought victims.

I can go on and on.

What kind of change would you foresee in the world after a Kryptonian invasion. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Showing a damaged Superman </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think Snyder and WB missed a big opportunity in not showing a damaged Superman.

A small problem in MoS was the lack of battle damage as Clark and Zod fought. They punched and threw each the other into glass, steel and concrete - and yet it didn't look like they were hurt.

It's hard to know whether Superman is hurt without a visual representation (blood, scars, bruises) of his pain. 

In the movie, Batman is pummelling Superman after being affected by the kryptonite. Yet, even at his weakest, he doesn't really get damaged. You can see his pain, but it doesn't seem serious enough to warrant worry from the audience.

Obviously it's a PG rated movie and blood can't be used - but bruises and a dishevelled suit/cape is more than enough to show the physical damage Superman endured.

After getting smashed again and again, it doesn't make sense for him to have a [pristine face and a great perm](http://imgur.com/U0ZNzts).

This is a [toy](http://imgur.com/K4AjYSg), but it's a great representation of what Superman could've looked like in the Batman fight or in the Doomsday battle.

Unless future movies show a more "battle damaged" Superman, the audience will always see him as a character who can never really get hurt.

That is why Superman's death felt like it came out of nowhere, the audience never felt that he was ever in mortal danger....which is why his death didn't sit well with most.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find Thomas Elliot one of the most interesting villains in Batman lore. This is a guy who was Bruce's friend while other kids were afraid to approach him. 

He was smarter than Bruce, always winning games like Chess. This was because his mum forced him to learn Aristotle and strategy, to avoid getting abused by his father.

One day, Thomas Wayne takes them both to Metropolis - where they see a now retired Green Arrow fighting someone. 

By the ripe age of 10, he planned his parent's death. He hated his father and his complacent mother. He cut the brakes of the car and his father died in the accident. His mother was in serious condition but survived due to Thomas Wayne being one of the best surgeons in America.

Thomas Elliot now feels like the Wayne family is the reason why his plan didn't work. He also blames Bruce for asking Bruce to come on a helicopter to save his friend's mother.

He was sent to the counselling of Dr Crane (Scarecrow), who saw his sociopathic tendencies but found him interesting and let him go.

After the Wayne's died, he felt like Justice was served.

His mother Marla, afraid he will leave her - held the promise of funding his medical school over his head.

Many years later he is working as a nuerosurgeon. Edward Nashton (Riddler) comes to him due to a diagnosis of Brain cancer. After giving up normal medicine, he decides to travel to Ra's Al-Ghul and the Lazarus pit.

Thomas finds out Edward's identity and asks for his help to get revenge on his old friend. After a while, he finds out Bruce is Batman and carries out a plan to destroy him.

He is one of few people to get close to destroying Bruce, manipulating and convincing all of Batman's villains in a slow and methodical plan that drives Bruce mad.

It introduces the plethora of Batman characters, without affecting the main story too much and focuses on the emotional trauma Hush is dishing out. 

Acting like a friend in the day, and his enemy in the night.

Seriously this dude is NUTS, at one point he gets plastic surgery to look like Bruce and destroy his reputation and his company!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I was having a cup of tea while watching a [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKnp-8sNNgs) of BvS. I decided to scroll down to the comments and saw [this](http://imgur.com/t4g2qBw).

I nearly spit hot tea on my lap........how did I not see this!!!

Think about it.

If Bruce wants to kill the alien that is Superman, he would keep the kryptonite on his person at all times (insurance). 

The grenade (kryptonite gas) weakens him but doesn't work for very long, a kryptonite bullet would've been very lethal to Superman and the logical choice. It would also yield Bruce a lot more bullets for future use, rather than one spear.

Without the spear;

- Lois wouldn't be drowning.

- Superman wouldn't die.

- They wouldn't need to move Doomsday to Gotham.

- Batman would've killed Doomsday, in a hail of kryptonite bullets. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-05-02 11:05:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In my opinion, the "Martha" scene broke the internal logic of the film.

Batman has an issue with Clark's possible destructiveness. The fact that he can destroy all of humanity on a bad day, is what worries Bruce. His paranoia fuelled by the events of BZ.

- Finding out he has human parents doesn't change that.
- Having Lois Lane explain who Martha is doesn't change that.
- Superman saying "Martha" doesn't change that.

**What happens in the movie?**

- The same Batman that had been indiscriminately killing every criminal he passed by is suddenly affected by the name of his mother - a common name he must have heard countless times.

- The same Batman that believed Superman was a danger to the whole race, stopped killing Superman and then declares him a "friend" (proceeded to killing shortly after).


- The Batman who has been suffering all these horrible dreams and nightmares is somehow no longer suspicious of Superman (even though he's killed by him in the knightmare).


**That moment, although emotional - breaks the logic of the movie.**


Now, if Batman wasn't killing during the movie (no kill rule), then it would make a lot of sense. This was a man who avoided killing the worst of criminals but felt it necessary to kill Superman. 

As he is about to kill him, hearing his mother's name allows him to realise his mistake. The morals and teachings his mother and father instilled in him - flood through his brain as he realises the hypocrisy of his actions.

Giving people the benefit of the doubt is what his father always taught him, and Bruce had become so blind - he ignored the obvious clues of Clark's human parents and life in Smallville.

	<TEXT> I have to admit, for a long time - I have hated critics for their slams on Man of Steel which I thought was an amazing movie. I also defended Batman v Superman as I thought the movie would fix issues of the previous movie (the biggest being the collateral damage).

We as DC fans rained hate and fire on Drew McWeeny - who stated that WB was worried and that in his opinion, Snyder would be taken off JL.

We treat critics as if they are a different breed to us, even though most of them are fans like you. The hatred has become so bad, Devin Faraci decided to answer questions on this sub to try and [mend](https://twitter.com/devincf/status/726203290300502016) the bridge between fan and critic.......to no avail.

I *used* to hate critics (that didn't like what I did), but it was Batman v Superman that made me realise, without them - the movie industry would be a boring place. If there is no constructive criticism, loving or hating something becomes derivative.

*This sub has been very sensitive these past few weeks.*

There will be a lot of news coming soon about JL and future DC films. However, that does not mean you shoot the messenger because you did not like what they've discovered. 

Hating McWeeny for reporting what his sources told him is wrong.

Hating Faraci for reporting what his sources told him are wrong.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a theory on the new photos that we got from the Wonder Woman set in Paris.

Please bear with me.

In Man of Steel, we get an easter egg of the Wayne Enterprises logo on the satellite.

http://imgur.com/rZ5CiGO

We see the same/similar logo in Batman v Superman, where he's holding the little girl.

http://imgur.com/7WTXMkT

It's safe to assume that it's the offiial logo of Wayne Enterprises, the sleek "W".

Keep that in mind as we examine the Wonder Woman set photos.

In the Wonder Woman photos, we see a black truck with what seems to be the Wayne Enterprises logo.

But...it's a tad different to the logo in BvS and MoS.

http://imgur.com/pY7PycA

Until I realised, it's the same logo as the "Alfred" promotional material.

http://imgur.com/YqjNHwH

Why does Alfred and this truck have different logos to the establised Wayne logo?

.....and then it hit me. This was the **old** logo of Wayne enterprises.

Alfred was under the employment of Thomas and thus can be considered - an employee of the old Wayne enterprises.

This means that maybe after a few years of controlling the company, Bruce felt the company needed to re-brand itself as a "modern" and "forward thinking" company.

From this, I believe that the footage being shot here is before both BvS and MoS.

	<TEXT> but I feel that the CGI in "Man of Steel (2013)" was better than "Batman v Superman (2016)".

Obviously, I'm talking about overall quality. 

In Man of Steel, I never "felt" the CGI - I didn't notice any poor work.

In Batman v Superman I can remember quite a lot of scenes where the surroundings look....fake.

The most puzzling thing is the fact that MoS is reportedly 25 million dollars cheaper.....and that BvS had 3 years to polish the movie.

Scenes in BvS where I felt the CGI was pretty bad;

- [Batman's plane crashing into a building, and Doomsday skating](https://www.youtube.com/v/Al0-ks6nRBY?version=3 start=0 end=13 autoplay=1 hl=en_US rel=0).

- Batman shooting the last Kryptonite bullet at Doomsday, standing next to a badly rendered wall.

- Superman's "Bizarro" face after getting hit by the nuclear blast.

- Doomsday's janky movements and lightning.

What do you think? Are there scenes you recall, where the CGI was not up to par?

Conversely, what scene from MoS and BvS do you think is a masterpiece in CGI work? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Has Snyder's Batman always been a killer? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-19 10:06:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are two opinions in the community about the origins of Batman's killing;

- Batman began killing after the BZ Event 18 months prior to the film.

- Batman began killing after losing Robin.

I have reason to believe that this Batman has ALWAYS been a killer.

Recently, [Snyder stated that in his mind Bruce Wayne is still mourning the tragic murder of an unspecified Robin some ten years before the events of Batman V Superman  the result of a deadly run-in with a younger Joker. ](http://au.ign.com/videos/2016/03/30/how-the-death-of-robin-shaped-ben-afflecks-batman)

This means canonically (if we take in the assumption that this was the event that transformed him), Batman started killing 10 years ago.

According to the [BvS Tech Manual](http://imgur.com/GCLKfX2), Robin uses a Spear.......a deadly weapon.

Why would Bruce allow Robin to use a sharp spear if his modus operandi dictated that he would never kill? 

This means that Batman has been a killer for at least 10 years in his 20 year career - and a large possibility that he was always a killer.....before AND after he recruited Robin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to love Man of Steel. It was a movie about an alien's first contact with humanity and him living in this continuous limbo, essentially becoming a lone wolf.

I had issues with the last third of the movie, where Superman didn't really seem to care about all the people dieing around him as he punched Zod and kissed Lois on the burning ashes of the dead.
Even then, I defended the movie with my every breath, defending Kal's actions as "amatuerish" due to him only knowing his origins a day or two ago.

Snyder and WB told us that "Batman v Superman" would be a movie where we finally see him experienced yet still wet behind the ears. The Man of Steel who would become Superman as we know and love. Bruce would hold him accountable for the deaths in the BZ Event and there would be a hearing where his actions would be questioned.

What we got is yet another movie where Clark/Kal is mopey, depressed and reticent. Henry Cavill hardly gets anything to work with and we get a cardboard cutout of what Superman should be.

Forget about the people he saves and think about how he **acts**.

-First scene where we see Superman is him smashing a terrorist through a wall and killing him (don't you dare say he didn't).

-The only scenes we see of Clark is either doing googly eyes at Lois or arguing with Perry about Batman. Even when he encounters Bruce, he is only a soundboard for Bruce to spout his beliefs on Superman.

-He doesn't talk to anyone he saves in the montage, and kept a solemn/sad face as he did it. Or worse, he hovers above them like he's a God.

-He doesn't interact with anyone from the Daily Planet except Lois and Perry.

-Snyder doesn't allow him to talk in the hearing and try to explain his stance, and somehow doesn't hear the bomb (I'll get to that later).

-Instead of doing something that makes sense and saving his Mum, he goes to the one man he has had a problem with and tries to reason with him. He tries twice but decides not to reason with him a third time when Batman was cornered and instead throws him into a building (totally unnecessary/useless given his situation).

-Doesn't talk with Wonder Woman during the ~~Doomsday fight~~ whole movie.

-Finally, the lack of consistency regarding Superman's powers. He somehow wasn't able to hear the bomb as he was not "focused" on it and also couldn't hear his mum get kidnapped........ BUT....... is able to hear Lois falling off a building from the North Pole (or wherever he was) and also hear her knocking on concrete 100 metres away from him (while "focused" on Doomsday).

So the operative question is, did we really get Superman in this movie? Superman/Clark/Kal is a very interesting character who **ALWAYS** tries to do good for others and never feels burdened to do it. He may encounter problems along the way but he always strives and never gives up.

I was surprised because thats the thesis of Superman for me, that you cant just have superheroes knock around and have there be no consequences" - Zack Snyder.

Zack, at a fundamental level - does not get who the character is. Clark Kent/Superman is a person who always does good, even when he doesn't have to. Even when it's easier for him to do the wrong thing, he continues to be a morally incorruptible being living in a world of cardboard. Superman shows us that even though he is an alien - he is more human than us all.

I always excused Snyder for Man of Steel, always thinking we would get the definitive Superman. I don't trust him anymore, neither will I wait for this "evolving" character some fans on this sub seem to see.
All I see is a character shit on and pumped with a Randian belief structure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About a week before I saw the movie, I came across a Jesse Eisenberg interview. The interviewer said something very interesting about Mercy that I thought would be incorporated into the movie. 

So around the [five minute mark](https://youtu.be/P-diYSVmQCE?t=318), she talks about Mercy being an "enabler" to Luthor. 

As you know, Mercy Graves has hardly any role in the movie - which poses the question; 

**Were the early screenings different to the final cut or was this interviewer interpreting something that's not there?**

In the movie, she maybe has one line or two and then.....you know.....Granny's Peach Tea to the rescue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> killing off Clark Kent. It's mildly understandable why he decided to kill Superman, but by killing off Clark - he has destroyed one of the most important aspects of his being. 

Clark is not an alter ego, it's his real identity. When he comes back for JL - are they going to make him Superman full time?

The whole reason for him being a reporter was to be able to mingle with the world and understand humanity.....being able to live a normal life with Lois and his Mum. 

By omitting the Clark Kent Funeral, and showing a more private service of the 4 people that know he died (Bruce, Diana, Lois and Martha)- you would be able to tug at the heart strings without burning his identity. 

The newspaper Perry is reading could have had a small article with the header, "Daily Planet Reporter Clark Kent missing" - allowing other directors the opportunity to work with the "human side" of Superman's life down the line.

I saw Man of Steel and the promises Snyder was making about the sequel and believed that we would get a lot more of Clark as a reporter and a bigger dive into his character......how disappointing.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Snyder is a visual director, who has some issues with his pacing. However, why does Warner Brothers ALWAYS cut his movie. They always take 30-40 minutes of footage from the movie that could have helped the pacing, characterisation and plot. It may affect the Box office a bit, but the negative press has lost the company more money than a 3 hour movie would.

WB should now know that Snyder's Director's cut IS always the better movie. 

Would Batman v Superman be a better movie with more footage? I don't know. 

Would the pacing and editing of the movie improve? YES

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After watching the movie a few times, I had assumed that when Superman cries "Martha!", Batman stops because he finally realises that he was a normal person with a family and parents. However, when Batman is dragging Superman with a wire a minute before, he says something along the lines of;

 "your parents probably taught you that you would change the world, my parents taught me not to die needlessly in a gutter....to make the world make sense - you had to force it to."

Here, Bruce acknowledges the fact that Superman has parents but still sees him as "never being a man".

 If so, is hearing "Martha" (a very common name) the only thing that stopped him from killing?

	<TEXT> How amazing would it have been, if the Black Zero event in the beginning of the movie was extended and used to give a glimpse of the Justice League.
Begin with the public and their hysteria as the invasion begins. Victor Stone gets out of his SUV to save a pregnant woman in a petrol station - his coach and bodyguard are screaming for him to come back. He is able to save her but the station bursts into flames with him in there and the building crushes him. Show Victor screaming.......and pan out to show the amount of people running away while he is trapped in there.

Bruce gets out of his helicopter, starts driving the car while talking to Alfred. He's telling Alfred that he failed his employees because he told them to ignore Zod's message that was televised everywhere......he thought it was a hacker's practical joke and din't really focus enough attention on it. The stock exchange was closed that day, but he still asked a small group of people to ensure the company's shares weren't affected.

A big crowd is looking at a man who has decided to jump because his building is on fire. He jumps and everyone is in shock and grief, the fire fighters can't save him.......and then something blurs past everyone and the man is safe. Everyone, including Bruce are shocked at what just happened, but his attention is diverted by the screams of Wallace.

Aquaman wouldn't be seen as he would most likely have his problems in the ocean due to the terraforming in the Indian Ocean and the damages to sea life/Atlantis.
Wonder Woman may have seen the news but since she is either back at Themiscyra or in another country, she wouldn't be able to reach Metropolis in time.

	<TITLE> Luthor's plan </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-01 04:59:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So Luthor's plan in the movie was;

1 - Create an international incident by killing terrorists and blaming Superman's intervention.......using experimental bullets?

2- Manipulate Bruce Wayne by giving him messages from Wallace......which he didn't get until just before the bombing?

3- Try and get a senator's approval for a Kryptonite weapon to use against Superman if he went rogue........and blow her up (with Mercy Graves)?

Saw the bat signal and pulled off the kidnapping of Martha and Lois within an hour or two without Superman hearing?

Throw Lois off the Helipad so that he could save her, proposes a battle to the death with Gotham's Bat.

Plan to release Doomsday, even on the off chance that Superman was killed.....and no fail-safe.


An alternative plot the movie could have taken:

1- Luthor finds Kryptonite and contacts Bruce (who he knows is Batman) to collaborate and create a weapon.

2- Wayne works on the Kryptonite in his offices while Luthor is finding a way to destroy Superman (Bruce does not want to kill Clark but is afraid of what could happen if there is no contingency).

3- Capitol bombing made to look like Superman's fault (heat ray created by Lex). 

4 - Batman realises Lex's intentions and needs to stop Superman from saving his mother.

5 - Lex makes Martha swallow Kryptonite. If Superman tries to lift her and fly - they will both die. Batman saves both of them from the fall.

6- Unleashes a swarm of Kryptonian drones he created, Superman can't fight (Kryptonite has bigger effect on him), Batman is having a lot of trouble staying alive. Wonder Woman arrives.

7- Batman takes Martha to the hospital to take out the Kryptonite in her stomach and then goes to Lexcorp to plant a virus to stop the drones.

Obviously, the movie I pitched wouldn't be called "Batman v Superman". What would you change about the movie?

	<TEXT> It's been a long journey for DC fans.....a very long journey. However, I've been noticing that this subreddit has been in Civil War. Some people loved the film, others liked it but have issues with it and some hate it. My issue with the subreddit at the moment, is this almost cult-like worship of Snyder that no other Director experiences. Fans are defending the movie by attacking critics, people on the internet who don't agree with them and every video/post discussing the movie. Does anyone remember Fantastic 4 (2015)? That movie was destroyed by critics and the movie became a laughing stock. I did not see a single person on the internet defending Josh Trank, blaming 20th Century for locking him out of the editing room, firing technicians and cutting significant amounts of footage in the movie. Essentially turning what could have been a good film into a dumpster fire. Whether you loved the movie or not, Snyder with all his resources and time didn't deliver. Like any company, all WB care about is money....that is the reason "Young Justice" was taken off air. So when fans pay to watch the movie 6 times and then beg them for the cinematic treatment of the Ultimate Cut....all you are doing is showing them that they could do no wrong. 10 years ago, fans felt that they could never control what big companies do with their favourite characters. Now, with the help of social media - we can demand big companies to hear our voices. Please don't let Snyder charm you with the future as he did with "Man of Steel", don't let him get away with it by saying "this is a fan's movie". It feels that we have a collective Stockholm syndrome, where we feel only Snyder could deliver a good DC movie....which just isn't true. 
TLDR; Be a responsible fan, do not be sucked in by any director's comments and know that you deserve better. LOL it sounds like I'm talking to an emotionally abused person! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After Doomsday falls on Strykers island, Batman tells WW to keep him busy as he tried to retrieve the kryptonite. He reaches the Gotham Warehouse district and sees Lois Lane and she shows him where the spear is. He tells her that he will keep an eye on Supes for her and that she should get out of here as anything could happen. He also tells her that he has called a ride for her and that she should wait at the entrance. Alfred remotely drives the batmobile to her location and gets her to safety from Doomsday's bursts. When he comes back he sees Superman and Wonder Woman trying to fight Doomsday. Superman tells Batman to give him the kryptonite but he refuses (he would die). WW gets annoyed, grabs the spear and throws it at Doomsday's heart. Doomsday is impaled by the spear but is trying to take it out of himself. Superman jumps and pushes the spear in deeper. Supes gets weaker from the kryptonite and gets stabbed in the arm by Doomsday. He is about to get stabbed again before Wonder Woman lasoo's him to safety and Batman uses the sonic weapon (used on Superman), shoots every single gadget he has and finally ends it with shooting an experimental cross bow explosive that blows him up....killing him. Result:  No damage to Gotham, small damage to Metropolis, no dead superman, Batman deals the final blow, WW shows she's a badass  and Superman shows that even after throwing a nuclear bomb at him - he still stands tall. News Helicopters are recording what happened...... and the public cheer. We see the Justice league truly cooperate and show themselves just how effective they are when they work together. </TEXT>

Batman didn't show the audience that he's a master technician, Alfred didn't talk to him during the fight and Superman was......doing whatever he liked. WW was able to handle Doomsday but didn't ask for help or create a plan when she lassoed him. We live in a world where the Avengers and the X-Men exist. Big groups of super heroes that work on screen due to them being.....a TEAM. That is why I'm currently dreading Snyder's JL and looking forward to Ayer's Suicide Squad. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-03-27 15:59:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the movie, we get the Knightmare scenes - which is a possible future of a Superman who lost Lois due to Batman. Darkseid is also involved somehow and Flash comes back to warn Bruce. We also know, that Thomas Wayne is played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. In the opening scene of the movie, we see him try to punch Joe Chill. So, it's not hard to guess his course of action if his son is the one to die that night. What makes the Flashpoint such an interesting DC story, is that we see a world where the characters are fundamentally different. Aquaman is fighting with Wonder Woman, Superman is skinny and weak after being tested on in a bunker and Thomas Wayne is Batman and kills. This alternate history is great because we get to see what a Batman who kills would look like......and his use of guns interesting. How can this cinematic universe show an alternate reality Thomas Wayne who's gone off the deep end if his son (the normal Batman) kills. If this Batman did not kill, but was awefully close to doing it, the portrayal of Thomas Wayne killing thugs and villains would be a lot more impactful. Therefore, to those who think the Flash's story will be the "Flashpoint Paradox" - don't keep your hopes up. </TEXT>

Yes, he essentially created the scenes to resemble the way a comic book transitions a story. However, although I see what he was trying to do, I can't excuse him for the movie.

	<TEXT> the scene where everyone is lamenting for Superman just wasn't deserved. During the whole movie, it's clear that people either don't trust him, or seem him as this god figure who could do anything. We never see him talk to common folk or show him interacting with the world around him. The Doomsday fight and the subsequent death did not feel deserved. The reason his death works in comics and animation, is that they make sure the battle is seen by the public and televised ....as people see him getting pummelled to save them. The Doomsday fight started in Metropolis, went to space, came down to Strykers island and finally moved to Gotham's warehouse district.

	<DATE> 2016-03-24 05:22:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before we begin, let me just say I enjoyed the film. It does not deserve the abysmal RT rating, but I also understand where the critics are coming from. As a fan, I give the movie a 5/10 in terms of execution and a 8/10 for the enjoyment.

Now, onto my thoughts.

Batman v Superman is a montage of a better movie. Every single scene of this movie is followed by another which has no relation to the previous. A jarring experience, the movie fails to flow like a normal movie. Instead you get a hodge podge of scenes that don't mix well together and you have to fill in the blank. It feels like the movie was edited the night before release, which is very saddening as the actual scenes show there is more to the movie than that. 
The movie is divided into two different films. A batman and Superman story relating to an incident that occurs in the movie, and the Dawn of the Justice League movie.
I feel like the whole movie could have been on the first half. The character of Scoot Mcnairy and Luthor could have had more screen time, showing us their motivations. It could have been a simple character assasination of Supes in the public using social media while tinkering on Kryptonian technology. I remember the Forbes article of Luthor, they told us that we would be getting a tech billionaire similar to the ones we have in our world today. Sadly, we got a mental psychopath billionaire Riddler. There is no facade, anyone who sees him in public can see that the dude has a screw loose. I feel they could have gone less crazy and focused on his origins and why he feels a god should kneel for him. The JL cameos are so jarring and sequel - baiting.....my god. However, the cameos themselves were really cool (especially the Flash cameo). Now, onto the final battle and the second act. I HAAAAAAAAATED Doomsday, the CGI is just soooooo baaaaad it's not even funny. The fight scene had it's cool moments but not only was it shortlived, but the choreography of Wonder Woman's fighting is blocked by CGI dust and lightning. Before I saw this movie, I thought that the problem lied in the 30 minutes Zack took out of the movie....but I was wrong. The movie could literally be 6 hours and it still wouldn't be able to do the plot justice. The film is fun, but the absolutely amazing and jaw dropping first half of the movie (where all the intrigue is) is thrown on the way side.

Pros-
Ben Affleck IS the best Batman ever possiby.
I want more Jeremy Irons as Alfred, his relationship with Bruce is amazing.
Lois Lane is a better character now.
Wonder Woman is god damn amazing.
Amazing score.
Amazing cinematography (except for the final fight)

Cons - 
Eisenburg's Luthor is a rich, psycho Jim Carrey with daddy issues.......no subtlety.
Batman becomes Frank Castle with a cape in this movie.
Superman never explains himself - always runs away when the time is needed for him to come out and tell others his stance. 
Henry Cavill's charisma and charm is bottled in by a quiet Superman with just a hints of those qualities in the first half of the movie.
Needed more Holly Hunter and General Swanwick.
Very bad pacing issues - the movie feels disjointed.
Doomsday is horrible

TLDR - fun movie with a lot of problems. Cutting the second half and focusing on the issue between Luthor, Superman, Bruce Wayne and Scoot Mcnairy's character would have greated a literal perfect movie.

	<TEXT> I realised something today.
As I was in university, I realised just how big a part of my life this movie consumed. Every day I would be finding new info on the movie, re-watching trailer reactions, comic con announcements etc. As DC fans, people laughed at us for loving Man of Steel. Our hope was in the horizon - Batman v Superman would be our saviour. I mean, how can it go wrong? You have an oscar winning writer, a visionairy director, amazing actors.......this would put DC on the map and show Marvel fans a more cerebral comic book movie enjoyed by all. I felt pathetic today, feeling nausea over the RT percentage. I will undoubtedly enjoy the movie, I was never a hard person to please. Zack Snyder, you are an amazing director but I now want a different person helming JL. You can still be the brain child/producer, I just don't want you to direct. We threw so much shade at marvel for all their mistakes; the constant dying and coming back to life, the pacing issues, the quipping.....and yet we have nothing to be proud of in the DCEU (Man of Steel is amazing).

I will see the movie tomorrow, and I will love it, but when I come home and watch reviews and discussions, I will always feel this pang of anger.

NOTE - Please don't downvote, these are emotions I felt today that I wanted to vent out.

	<TEXT> Ok, we currently know she gave BvS a 90.
So I wanted to see how it compared with the reviews of other comic book movies. She gave Captain America: The first Avenger a 78 (http://www.criticschoice.com/movie-archive/?page=5).                                    She gave Green Lantern a 62 (http://www.criticschoice.com/movie-archive/?page=11).                                                                                                      She gave Jonah Hex a 52 (http://www.criticschoice.com/movie-archive/?page=14). She gave Red a 76 (http://www.criticschoice.com/movie-archive/?page=22).          Scott Pilgrim got an 80 (http://www.criticschoice.com/movie-archive/?page=23).

I tried my hardest to look at all her ratings, and I have to say - Batman v Superman is shaping up to be like the TDK (which is a serious thing to say). She doesn't seem like a fad reporter and has given lower marks to movies which are loved universally.

TLDR; Carrie Keagan is not Hax, seems to be serious reviewer. Serious reviewer gave good rating for Batman v Superman........very excited. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you think the Watchtower will look like in the Justice League movie. In most renditions, it's in space - but then they would need boom tubes?

	<TEXT> After reading the Timeout Gotham City Brochure, it has become clear that the Batman has always avoided the limelight. Will Dawn of Justice end with Batman coming out and being awarded a medal by the President (similar to JL: War)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What would Batman's role be in the fight with Doomsday?

The movie has to be in the realm of believability, how could he help Wonder Woman and Superman?

Mind you, I love the trinity - but the final shot of the 2nd trailer where the trinity posed......felt off </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, first post ever on reddit - always have been a lurker but I'm so amped for this movie that I wanted some clarification.
The new Jeep ad for Batman v Superman shows the car Bruce driving having flash lights on top, similar to a emergency response vehicle. I had originally assumed that Bruce commandeered the car from someone else.....but if he didn't - how would you explain flashing lights on a personal car.
Thanks </TEXT>
