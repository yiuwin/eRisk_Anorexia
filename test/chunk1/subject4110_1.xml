	<TEXT> One time for me there was a kid that me and several friends knew from high school. He said he wanted an ounce so my buddy was happy to do it for him since we knew him. We also knew that his brother was a police officer and he comes from a relatively good family (they're black). Anways... The kid and his friend come to meet up with us in a parking lot. I just started getting this sketchy vibe especially since he had a weird friend there acting as a sort of look out. When he approaches the car he asks to smell the weed. The second he gets the bag he pulls out a pistol and decks my friend who was driving in the face with it. We were parked on a hill and when my friend got hit he took his foot off the brake pedal and the car went down the hill and smashed into the car in front of him. Right after, the kid who stole the ounce lets out the loudest of what sounded like a gorilla mating call and took off in a sprint. It was insane. Everybody was just like, "Did that really fucking happen?". Still see the kid around walking the streets. Fuck him. He's a piece of shit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I go to Chico State. I was a "rebel" as a high school student and Chico was the only school I applied for and happened to get in. I've always been the kind of kid who would never study and get a better grade than the kid next to me who would study his ass off. I really wish that I would have tried harder in high school to get into a UC. I still think I would have been how I am no matter what school I went to. My dream schools were UCLA and UCSB... they still party pretty hard. 

I have dated a few girls, I had two "girlfriends". Didn't last more than 6 months though with both of them. I have a really difficult time being with one girl. I just feel I am still young and I only have so much more time until girl's tits start sagging, they gain weight, ect.... My dad's friends always give me advice to sleep with every girl I possibly can even if they are a bit "chubby" because I will wish I did when I am their age. 

I am really not despised to death by anyone. I am well liked and my input and values are respected by all my peers. I keep my bros as my main priority because I know they are the ones who will be there for me when things get tough. I am a firm believer in not fucking people over, maintaining honesty, and refusing to lie, cheat and steal. I'm sure I've gotten with a girl that one of my friends really wanted to get with but I would never stab someone in the back if they already had something going on with her. 

If you have taken the Myers Briggs personality test I am a ENFP personality. It literally describes me to a T. I just took it last week and am still pretty hyped on the accuracy of it.

If I was about 3-5 inches taller I feel it would be a lot different. There are guys I feel I have better looks than but they can still pull more random chicks in a bar than me because of their height.  </TEXT>

On Thursdays they hold power hour which is 50 cent drinks from 9-10pm. They used start at 25 cents and raise 25 cents every 15 minutes.

	<TEXT> I have so many crazy stories. Seen a lot of things. I had a party at my house with well over 1000 people, it got out of control and a riot started to break out with kids throwing beer bottles at horse cops while cops were beating kids with their bats. It turned into a riot with couches lit on fire and my house getting about every cop within a 20 mile vicinity at my house trying to break up the party. Really gnarly.

Alcohol poisoning wise, lots of kids fall casualty to it. This year alone 8 kids have died from alcohol poisoning, including two kids that I know. Really sad... our greek system is in huge trouble for it right now. Things definitely aren't the same anymore in my town. 

Many kids have died. One kid died on the couch in a back yard of one of my bros houses. Another kid I knew that was in the snowboard club with me died last semester from 21 shots on his 21st birthday. Not very good memories.

I was a good student. I made the dean's list my first two years of college but I have cooled off a little bit. I still have a 3.15 cumulative and am considering the Master's program.

My degree is in Project Management with a minor in Managing for Sustainability. Great major.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am from San Diego where it is predominately white and mexican. There weren't many black kids at my school at all. The ones who were black were most likely on the football team or hung out with whites. I used to despise mexicans much more than blacks and always wondered why people were so racist against black people. I then moved to Northern California in an area with a lot of blacks. They are horrible, ruin everything, will take advantage of you at every opportunity they can. I had a big party at my house and a group of ghetto blacks come in my house. They proceed to break the fire extinguisher glass, spray it out all over my whole kitchen, fuck everything up and then pee on my fridge. I didn't even know these people, this is just how they naturally act. Like animals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a college student in a similar situation, there are a lot of things you can do. Really, what is most important is diet if you want to get the results you are imagining in your head. Healthy eating is thought of as expensive, but can be cheap if you do it the right way. Unfortunately, you will have a lot of days and nights of very boring and routine meal plans, but that is something that you get used to after about a week when you first start seeing results. Staples that I always have in my cupboard and fridge are: Egg whites (comes in a box), brown rice, CHICKEN BREAST, almonds, peanut butter, spinach and all other veggies, various fruits, turkey, cottage cheese, milk, chicken sausage/burgers -- turkey burgers are fine as well. I try at all cost to avoid cheeses and things such as mayo and high fat salad dressings. Remember there are good and bad fats, you want to stick with the natural fats. Also, late night munchies and alcohol are EXTREMELY detrimental to achieving your fitness goals. I do drink on weekends, but I always avoid that beer with my meal on the weekdays. Good luck, train hard, and your goals will be achieved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so I am a 22 year old male soon to be college graduate. I have been smoking cigarettes with about the same habit (3-7) per day since I was about 14 depending if I have any drinks or not. I have always been athletic, workout 5-6 days per week and eat extraordinarily healthy. I just picked up the habit when I was really young, being influenced by an older crowd and its something that I have really never been able to kick. I feel this is because I haven't had any negative effects from it (thus far). I have friends that don't smoke and I can still kick their ass in a run. What are your opinions on this? I really want to stop, but there is nothing like enjoying a fine smoke in certain occasions. I need quitting inspiration!! help me!! Anybody in a similar situation? </TEXT>
