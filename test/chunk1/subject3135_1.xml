	<TEXT> Asylum. When I was 14. It might be the most cheesiest and cliche horror movie I've seen. I'm talking fake blood and brains and an obvious plot. But I had to have my friends pause it at the chase scene because I was freaking out. My heart was pounding like crazy and I was hyperventilating. Now I can't watch scary movies without a knitted blanket over me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I nanny'd for two kids during the summer, and was constantly trying to find activities to do with them. I decided that we would paint pictures for the parents. On a small tube of paint, one of the lids would not come off, so I put pressure on the tube. It burst open and splattered on their kitchen wall and myself. I tried to clean it up, but it had started to stain the wall. I get the brilliant idea to use a Magic Clean Eraser to wipe the paint off, but it ends up lightening patches of the wall. So to make sure the parents wouldn't find out what happened, I used 3 Magic Clean Erasers to lighten the entire wall. </TEXT>
