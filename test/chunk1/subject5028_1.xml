	<TEXT> I just find it shocking how many people actually smoke in their school. I live in a very similar environment(middle to upper middle class) and even though weed is really big around my area, there is still a big part of people that don't smoke. I would say that about 40% have no desire to want to smoke in my school. It's just so hard to fathom how these people are saying that they only have 3  friends that aren't actively smoking right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I somewhat agree on that, but he also couldn't have done anything to stop that goal. The defender didn't mark his man on the back post and bendik was positioned to save from a cross right in front of him as he should've been.

	<TEXT> I've already noticed that some people on this subreddit are saying that they want "anyone other than bendik in goal" and that "his playing Sunday was less than exciting." Seriously? we've gotten one game in and people are trying to blame the poor guy for the goals let in and neither were his fault. He's a solid keeper, this is what happened at Toronto last year. He had a weird game and people started to bandwagon and say that they wanted him gone when he was seriously was doing nothing wrong. Can we please give the guy like 5 games before we start making any sort of assumptions like that. For the record Bendik's distribution and pass completion were significantly better than Rimando's on Sunday and Rimando is the MNT's third string keeper. Here's an article in which Stewart Kerr (goalkeeping coach) made remarks regarding what happened last year and why people need to give the guy a chance.

	<DATE> 2016-02-18 23:44:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So recently my phone has been acting weird and then today while I was on the phone with a custom t shirt company checking in on an order that I placed, my phone mic started cutting in and out but the call quality and person on the other line(t shirt guy) still sounded fine. I've never seriously damaged my phone and it is a relatively new Note 4. Now things got even stranger when literally right as I hung up, I received a text from a number in a completely different area code that I have never seen before and it said "what's from who?" http://imgur.com/bnyqV8J . This exchange than took place. Being sorta weirded out, I just searched the number in google on my computer and it appeared as a New York number. I than was still curious so looked online for what appeared to be a reliable phone look up website. I looked up my phone number first and it almost exactly located where it was located. I than searched the New York mystery number and then it appeared as being somewhere in China named "Makit". I cant seem to find that location and I'm sorta weirded out. Now i am not saying my phone is bugged but I am a pretty big fan of internet privacy and cell phone privacy. I am also highly against most militarized police departments and have openly searched a lot of stuff in the past couple of years relating to content like that. I'm just wondering if my phone could be bugged or tapped for any reason because of my search history against the government/police departments. I'm not saying that is what this is but I am just sorta worried and I want some answers.


Edit: I kept texting the number and things didn't get any better. Uploading those screenshots right now
