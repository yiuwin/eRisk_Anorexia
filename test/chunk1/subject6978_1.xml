	<TEXT> Yeah that's the one I so. I thought its an actual sunscreen for the eye area rather than an eye cream with SPF. Thank god you tell me it stung, almost bought it and its not cheap! I also agree with spending money on sunscreen. Most important thing! I'll look into the clinique one </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read a lot of scary things online, but that's why you do blood work every month. Talk about these things with your dermatologist. Don't get scared about what you see online. Of course, there ARE side effects. But everyone reacts differently. The reason I wrote this post is to show that its not always so bad! You might be one of those lucky people who only get dry lips. You never know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some people with hormonal acne find birth control to be the solution, or other things. I do believe when accutane is done right is can be a miracle. 
Regarding the cost, I'm lucky to live in a country where medical insurance is amazing, I don't pay to see a dermatologist, and accutane itself is very cheap, around $20 a month.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was near 22 years of age and still had my "mild to moderate sometimes" but persistent acne, I became very anxious and sad about it. I had tried everything I could have by this point of 10 years dealing with acne. Everybody said my acne wasn't "bad enough" to justify taking accutane, but I really hated my skin. I wanted to work in the makeup industry, and it's not easy to have acne in this job. I finally bit the bullet and decided to go see a dermatologist, who gladly prescribed accutane, agreeing that it's time for me to try it. I weighed at that point 65kg and he started me on 40mg. The results were amazing! I would say by the second week, I started seeing stuff happen. All of my whiteheads and blackheads started making their way out. It was like seeing little stubbles coming out of my skin; first chin, then nose, and forehead. Some pimples I could feel were coming from very deep, and they were hard and painful. I was definitely purging. One month in, I had a very significant improvement. Now, I'm 2.5 months in, and the last time I had a pimple was about 2 weeks ago!!! 2 months in I saw the dermatologist again, said my progress is wonderful and we shall continue on the 40mg dosage for the next 3 months. My skin is so smooth, soft. The only thing I have is a few brown and red marks, which seem to be fading away every day.

Now let's talk side effects! First two week, my body hurt. Legs, arms, back. I felt like and old lady. But it went away on week three. Dry lips, from day one! But manageable. Sometimes my eyelids get dry. And the best side effect of all- I went from the oiliest skin and hair to normal!!! Not dry, NORMAL! I now wash my hair every 3 days, and my face is so not oily, and not dry!

When I tell people I'm on accutane they don't believe me. Because I've been dealing so well with the side effects. This is different for everyone, but if you moisturize your skin and lips like a crazy person from DAY ONE, it will definitely keep it from going extreme. Don't wait until you're peeling off to buy lip balm! Please, hear me out on this one. Drink as much water as your body can take!

I'm going to stop the ramble here. I would love to answer any questions in the comments! All I can say is, give accutane a try. Be smart about how you go about it, tell your dermatologist you prefer a relatively low dosage for a longer period (I will stay on 40 mg for an 8 month course) Listen to your body, as it might not be for you. Don't be scared from the initial purge. I looked worse before I looked better. 

To everybody who is now on accutane or whatever it is, good luck!!

Skincare routine: AM: Wash with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. Apply Vichy capital soleil SPF 50 sunscreen. (Its very moisturizing, I don't need any actual moisturizer after it)

PM: Remove makeup with a micellar solution (Bioderma, Vichy, Avene, Garnier, L'oreal, don't care which one) Wash with Cetaphil. Apply Acne.org moisturizer Apply Avene Cicalfate on marks. Eye cream (not too picky)

Lips! (And eyelids when they get dry) Bepanthene ointment, by Bayer. Its a miracle cream. If you can, BUY IT. I don't think they sell it in the States, buy everybody uses Aquaphor there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How old are you? What have you tried in the past? I would suggest trying other things before, like benzoyl peroxide, retin-A (tretinoin), and various things your derm can prescribe for you. If you have tried other things before, definitely consult your dermatologist and see what they think. You must be aware that there are side effects, and you never know how you will react. I posted my story so people would know its not all drama and desert dryness for everyone. Definitely lower dosages is the way to go! 
As far as creams- if you mean topicals for the treatment of acne, you must stop using them. Accutane is doing all the work for you, everything else you use must be very gentle, and with no acne treatments (like salycilic acid or benzoyl peroxide)
Makeup- I wear makeup every day, I work in a makeup counter now. I don't have problems at all. I'm using Revlon colorstay for the amazing staying power even though I'm not oily anymore. What you can use depends on how your skin reacts. The minute I get home I take off my makeup and do my night time routine, to let my skin breathe and heal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try using spices that are very rich in flavor, such as garlic, paprika, different types of peppers. 
If I'm not mistaken, you can taste flavor and saltiness better in food when its hot as opposed to cold, so look into that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm also on accutane and I actually don't have dry skin at all, only dry lips. But before accutane I was on retin-a which made my skin horrible, dry, flaky and red. What helped me the most was the acne.org moisturizer http://store.acne.org/single-items/moisturizer it saved my skin. Apply 2 pumps every night, and just one in the morning. You can also mix it with jojoba oil for added moisture and tone down the flakiness. Do this every night religiously and it will be way better.  Cleanse with cetaphil gentle cleanser.
BTW, what dosage are you taking? I'm on 40mg a day, and my acne wasn't bad, mild-moderate. The only side effect I've had is dry lips. I have moisturized with the acne.org since day 1 just like I suggested, to avoid dryness and keep my skin supple and soft.
If you have this much dryness already you might want to speak with your derm about lowering the dosage </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion losing weight is all about a long time change. Your body might be adjusting to what you've lost. 
Keep in mind the progress that you've already made as motivation to continue. Remember that changing something (in a negative way) at this point could make you move backwards instead of forward.
All the best </TEXT>
