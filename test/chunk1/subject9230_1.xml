	<TEXT> Everything you said is probably true, but can you people please fucking stop with the "every conservative is a racist/bigot" bullshit? Like seriously you painting every conservative in one portrait is insane. What if I said every liberal is a SJW? Nobody minds thoughtful discussion but we need to stop with the name-calling to advance this country forward.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really depends what you want to do. I'm currently working on a PhD in fisheries management and most of the jobs that stem from that are government positions which are typically 9-5. Professors definitely work a ton just because they are required to do research as well as teach.  Even tenured professors work a lot in the science fields.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Apartment complex said they are raising the rent "only" $100 a month if we sign the new lease by tomorrow. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> [North Carolina] I am not sure what to make of this. I got a flyer in my door saying that there was a $100 increase in rent per month if I sign my new 12 month lease by tomorrow.  It says Limited Time Only! like I am getting a deal.  This leads me to believe that there will be a greater increase if the lease is not signed by tomorrow, however when I go on the website the price matches what it would be if $100 was added to my rent.  Can they legally give me a notice 1 day before I sign my lease that they are raising the rent? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My gf and I (I am 27 M) broke up in March (stupid fight just never got back together).  I made a mountain out of a mole hill about something she did. After we broke up I realized how great she was and I regret the whole situation. I've been trying to get over her for the past 7 months but I keep having recurrent dreams with her in them. Usually it's about me telling her what a mistake I made and she says it's too late or something along those lines. I wake up from them with very bad stomach aches and profusely sweating. I can't go back to sleep because of how sick I feel.

Has anyone else had this problem? I need some relief because I'm getting no sleep and have to take  medicine for it.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, I am trying to create a server for my brother and I to play on.  I port forwarded the 25565 ports on my router and I can get into the server.  My brother **can** connect to the server, but once he is in he has 1 bar and is a good 15-30s behind.

My speedtest.net results are:  ping 6ms, download speed 216.23Mbps, upload speed 21.79 Mbps

His speedtest.net results are: ping 12ms, download speed 28.48 Mbps, upload speed 5.44Mbps

-I already went into firewall and allowed java to go through.  

Any ideas?

Edit: I'm running an i-7 with a GTX 1080 and 16gb of RAM. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So the other day I went to go to the laundry mat and when I turned the key to start my car it had a very hard time turning over. It took a couple seconds for the car to actually start... Then that's the last time it started. Right now when I turn the key nothing happens. It doesn't even sound like it's trying to start. All of the electronics work and my dad tried to jump it and that didn't do anything. Also, we changed the starter relay but that didn't help....any suggestions? Thanks

Edit: Triple A came and checked the battery.  It was at full charge.  Then he started banging on the starter and it turned over.   </TEXT>
