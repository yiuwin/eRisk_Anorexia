	<TEXT> The game seems to just devolve into Guard Break spamming with more experienced players, he who guard breaks wins. With Guard Break being so inconsitent for some classes as combo beginners, and others with guaranteed heavy swings, and others only light swings, and the difference in range for each hero. Also given that it connects during attack startups rather than only during guarding, it's kind of stupid. Add in to that the bad timing required to actually Counter the Guard Break, and it's just not fun. To actually counter one during a Multiplayer match you need to almost hit the button at the same exact time as the opponent, because of lag. Even dodge is useless against it.

In my opinion I feel like Guard Break should only work while the opponent is actively guarding or after a successful block or parry. Dodge should effectively evade the GB instead of it homing in on the dodger. And lastly I feel it should only give enough time for a light attack or actual hero combo. No heavy attacks guaranteed for any hero.

My opinion could be totally wrong but I feel it needs some kind of fix. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Almost Rep 4 here. Favorite hero. Just wanted a PSA for you conqbros on here, while in Revenge mode shield bashes knockdown as well not just guard break throws. So just dash and bash thr closest guy and punish him or you can swap targets to lighten that gang up load. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To deal with enemies guard breaking you just slap em with a light attack. It's actually quite fast and either hits then before they do it or disallows thr guard break since you're attacking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to mention if you're on the receiving end and have even the slightest lag your blocks do nothing even if on your end you think it should work. The attacks are faster than the guard stance switch plus latency. It sucks. </TEXT>
