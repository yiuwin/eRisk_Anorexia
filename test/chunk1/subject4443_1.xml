Edit :  can't believe i actually got it right(sort of) 

It's using carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ).

Also keep an eye on r/buildapcsales. You can probably grab those components for cheap on regular sales.


If you decide to get a new graphic card you might have to upgrade your psu. Since the power draw will be greater. 

Pcpartpicker is a great place to start with when building a new pc. You can check if parts are compatible with each other and how much power you'll need in total and plan your psu accordingly. So make an account there and drop your specs to check it out.

 Also, your mobo supports a fixed amount of ram, so best check how much max ram it supports. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a bunch of things that struck me as odd. 

You're buying a z series mobo(which is used for overclocking) which is expensive but using a cpu which can't be overclocked(6500) . You buying it to future proof it?

Then the 460. It's a ok card. Not too shabby. But you won't get the performance you want.  I don't know if it will suit your needs (gaming plus streaming) . Maybe a 470? 

8gig ram. Again. It seems somewhat less for a task that will be memory intensive (streaming) . Best to have 16gig.  


500gb hdd. This will run out sooner than you expect. I suggest at least 1TB. 


 I'll also like to suggest waiting for AMDs RyZen series cpus.

	<TITLE> The Whistler. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-05 16:33:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> One day in a well known university, a senior professor started his class on a very serious topic. The moment he turned towards the blackboard, one of the students whistled. He turned, looked at the class and asked the whistler's name ............. As usual and as expected no one answered.

The professor peacefully kept the pen in his pocket and picked up his bag. Saying that, the lecture ends here and that was enough for the day, he started moving towards the gate of the class ........... Students were overjoyed to be free.

Then, he suddenly stopped and turned towards the class, kept his bag on the table and said, "I'll tell you a story to utilise the remaining time". Everyone became interested.

Yesterday night I tried hard to sleep, but it was miles away from my eyes, so I thought I'd better get petrol in my car, which will save my time next morning and might induce sleep. After having my tank full, I started roaming in that area, enjoying the peace of a traffic free ride. 

Suddenly, on the corner I saw a girl who was as young and beautiful as the clothes she was wearing. Must have been returning from a party. Out of courtesy, I turned my car towards her and asked if I may be of any help. She asked me if I could drop her to her home, she'll be very obliged, to which I agreed.
(Who would deny a beautiful young company instead of a dry non sleepy need)

She sat in the front seat with me. We started talking, and to my amazement she was very intelligent, had control on many topics which many youngsters don't. 

When we reached her address, she admitted my courteous nature and behavior and accepted that she had fallen in love with me. 

I also admitted her intelligence and beauty and that I've also started liking her. I told her about my job as a professor in the university.

The girl asked my number, which I gave her willingly. Then she asked me a favor, to which i couldn't have denied naturally.

She said that her brother is a student in the same university, and asked me to take care of him, since we'll be in a long relationship now.

I asked the name of the student.She said that I'll recognise him with one of his very prominent quality.

He whistles a lot.

The moment the professor said this, all eyes in the classroom turned towards the boy who had whistled.
