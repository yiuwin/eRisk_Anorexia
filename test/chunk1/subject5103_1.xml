	<TEXT> That's a great point - never even noticed it. It may actually be upside down or maybe that is the style from back in the day. There are no hinge marks on the other side so if it is wrong, it's an error that was made a very very long time ago. Thanks for pointing it out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. I am buddies with a few locals at the nearby dog park and I once said, "well at least yuppies like me help the value of your place increase" (I said so in a friendly, joking manner). The guy said, "that would be great except I never plan on selling and leaving Southie, so all that does is make my property taxes go up."

I had never thought about it from a "this is my home and I will never leave" mentality until then.

Luckily I'm the type of Yuppie that most of the locals like (tolerate): Hard working, respectful and a D.I.Y. apartment owner. </TEXT>

This is in South Boston. My building is from 1880. This molding was already broken when I bought the unit last year but I may have broken a very small additional piece putting in the new fan.

I'm decently handy but this seems out of my league. I'm not against hiring someone but I don't even know where to start/ what type of contractor could do this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great question. I have never heard about legal limits on fees, one way or the other, but I'm sure a real estate attorney could answer that for you pretty easily.

In regards to compensation, I can tell you what the company I worked for did and what seems to be the standard in Boston.

We charged 1 months rent as the fee. The fee could be paid by the landlord, the customer or by both (50/50, 60/40, etc). Typically the customer would pay the fee for a desirable area, apartment and time frame. However if someone was renting a place that wasn't as nice, in a  just "OK" area and for an off season time period (most landlords like to be on the 9/1 - 8/31 time schedule) then the landlord would sometimes pay 1/2 or all of the fee to make the apartment more attractive. Because this is negotiable it was often our job to try and convince the landlord to pay some or all of the fee when we thought it would help close the deal.

Our company (even though the owner turned out to be a slime ball in my opinion) would never allow for an agent to collect full fee from the client and the landlord - although I heard of some agents trying.

As far as what the agent is actually paid, it was usually 1/2 of the fee. Some tenured agents got better rates but 50% was the norm. While this may sound awesome, there are many factors that suck when you are a real estate agent.

Typically...

No health insurance through the company (because you are an independent contractor), no taxes taken out beforehand (you have to be disciplined to put that money away for tax time) and the hours are ridiculous because you have to be working when normal 9-5er's aren't working in order to show them apartments.

Being a real estate agent was a great learning experience for me (all commission so I had to learn how to hustle) and it helped me learn what to look for when I bought my place over a year ago for an absolute steal (and is now worth over $100k more than I paid for it) but I usually caution anyone who is thinking about getting into the game.

Tl;dr: Typically agents split the 1 month fee with the agency and the fee cannot be charged to both client and landlord, but can be split between the two.

	<TEXT> I worked in real estate when I got out of college in 2007 and got fired because of an interaction with this man. Long story, short I put up a harmless flyer in some of his buildings advertising my services as a an agent. Unlucky for me, my colleague also put up some flyers but he was an idiot and wrote "Does your apartment suck? Call (name redacted)."

The next day Anwar called my boss furious and my colleague and I were fired on the spot. My boss really liked me and felt bad so called me a few hours later letting me know that he would try to fix it, that he knew I wasn't the one with the idiot flyer but that I shouldn't have advertised in Anwar's properties and that Anwar demanded we both be fired or all the Alpha Management apartment listings would be pulled from the company.

Like I said, my boss liked me, so later that night he let me know that I might be able to salvage my job after all. He said that I should go to Alpha Management headquarters and ask Anwar for forgiveness (and essentially my job).

Since I was basically broke and just getting my start in real estate, I figured I really didn't have any other option.

I went to Alpha Management which at the time was a run down (go figure) basement dwelling in Allston that was poorly lit and disorganized.

I did my best to convince Anwar that I was sorry. I told him that I wasn't the culprit behind the "crappy apartment" flyer - which I wasn't.. I don't remember the full circumstances of the meeting but I remember doing my best to be extra respectful and act almost desperate about losing my job - because I was.

I ended up getting my job back but with the caveat that I couldn't show any Alpha Management apartments to my clients, which was actually a blessing.

The more I learned about Anwar and his company over the years, the more I wish I had gone into his office that day and told him to pound sand. But again, desperate and poor as I was at the time, I know I did the right thing.

Let's just say that I do quite enjoy all the negative press he's been receiving lately. I guess he knew his apartments were crappy all along and the truth on the flyer hit a nerve.

tl;dr: I put a flyer in this guy's building, got fired for it, met with him to apologize and got my job back. </TEXT>
