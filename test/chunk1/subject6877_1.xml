	<TITLE> A Rant About University Rugby (Social) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-08 00:42:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I will be going to University next year and I am very keen to join the University rugby team there. (Cardiff) However I am literally terrified about the prospect of the initiations that I have heard rumours about through friends.  

I know a lot of people may roll their eyes at this and simply say, " get on with it, in the second year you can enforce the initiations." However I don't know if I want to put myself through that kind of experience or humiliation.  

For anyone who does not know, University rugby, it appears has grown a culture in where Freshers (First years) have to undergo a series of initiations to gain respect from their team. This can range from downing a pint of urine to eating a goldfish. The worst I heard is eating a Gurkin that has entered the unholiest of holes.  

I love rugby and I really want to play at University. However I cannot with the idea of these kind of games. 

Do any of you have any experiences or advice on how to deal with this.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Getting a little bit of constructive feedback saying that the video is quite sad. It is meant to be in my opinion. This tribute is more to demonstrate how this amazing talent who has done so much in his career, has had all that most probably ended in humiliating fashion. Having not won a Bledisloe cup and not being able to lift his team out of their current slump must be killing the man. For those that enjoyed it I'm glad and for other who feel it's a bit too sombre, I will try and change the feel in other videos !  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If you are a fan of watching rugby highlights and montages on youtube and facebook etc then I am asking you for some feedback.  

If you have the time could you answer me these questions.  

1. Do you actively search for highlights of rugby matches (Super Rugby, Rugby Championship) on youtube or do you stumble upon them.  

2. Are you a fan of a rugby montages which are more emotive or do you like seeing highlight reels showing the tries in certain matches.  

3. Are you a fan of [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n89Pp4_EPyY) kind of video as oppose to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7l2Q0IQeg) kind of video. When I say this, I mean do you prefer a video with the lighting of the video saturated and the editing to be more jumpy and accerlerated.  

4. What do you look for in a montage or highlight reel that impresses you.  

Thank you for answering these questions if you have the time. I have a channel and I aim to try and make content that everyone will enjoy and these answers will have me a great deal. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A view of the recent test series. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-26 23:12:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From watching almost all of the home nations matches in this test series (Excluding the Scots), I have to say that it appears to me that as a whole we are attacking with a lot more intent than in previous years. In the final test, Ireland could be seen running the ball from their own 22 when they were defending a 6 point lead. Similarly in the 2nd test for Wales, we could see a team that really looked to outscore NZ rather than attempt to block them out for a full 80 minutes.  

England proved that they are not only a great defensive team but a try scoring one against Aus this weekend. With all these teams appearing to show a more attacking mindset we can hopefully look forward to an exciting autumn/six nations if these teams translate this attacking brand of rugby to the northern hemisphere.   

Do people agree with this or feel that playing a more attacking game comes part and parcel of playing against SH teams? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey my channel is a fan made tribute page with rugby montages. I would like the logo to be similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/G0z7GOg.jpg) one.  

I would like the logo to have the letter RR possibly intertwined or behind one another but you can do what you think looks sharp and clean.

I would like there to be a black background and possibly a yellow RR that is the same colour as my banner on my channel or if you would like a white and yellow letter each way. [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_eeX1snxFbnZ4bGOYpMKQ)

Budget can be discussed. 

I would like something simple and sharp. Thanks in advance for your creativeness. </TEXT>
