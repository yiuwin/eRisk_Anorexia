	<TITLE> Halo: Escalation #5 [SPOILERS] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-04 22:40:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I was looking over the Halopedia page for the *Escalation* comics and was reading the synopses for them, and the synopsis for #5 caught my eye.
"Missing for thirty years, a legendary UNSC warship is discovered deep behind enemy lines. As *Infinity* plans a rescue mission, however, Admiral Hoods past with the ships captain threatens to jeopardize the mission. The investigation into the UNSC saboteur continues as the journalist infiltrates an Elite holy land in search of answers.

My immediate thought when I read the first sentence?
"OHMIGOD! THEY'RE GONNA FIND THE *SPIRIT OF FIRE*!!!!!1!1!!1!"

It's now 2558, minus 2531 is 27 years, acceptably roundable to 30 years.

	<TITLE> [BF4] Theory: BF4 DLC dates </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-10 06:20:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Looking through the Premium calendar of events, I noticed that there were a couple holes in the schedule.
One is coming up on the 20th, another on March 3, one on June 2 and a fourth on September 1. 

Considering that the final three DLC packs are due out Spring (Naval Strike) and Summer (Dragon's Teeth   Final Stand) of this year, I'm proposing that those are the dates (well, +1, for Tuesday, since all those dates are Mondays), save Jan 20, which the DLCs will be released on.

So, it would be Naval Strike on March 4, Dragon's Teeth on June 3 and Final Stand on Sept 2.

Whether or not this is the case, we shall see in the coming months.
I just wanted to get this out there before someone else did.

	<TITLE> Police of Reddit, what are some aspects of cop shows that are consistently accurate to real police work? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-08 04:16:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What aspects of police shows are consistently, or almost consistently accurate, across TV police shows and police movies?

For example, is it standard operating procedure to pull up to houses/buildings to execute a search/arrest warrant with sirens and lights going, or is it just for TV, because, in reality, that says they're going to be arrested, giving them a chance to run?
If it is SOP, why?

Side question: what, if any, legal ramifications are there for aiding a fugitive, who is ultimately discovered to be wrongfully accused? (A common cop show trope)

	<TITLE> What would be your subtitles for IM2 and IM3? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-14 08:56:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since it seems all non-IM sequels are being subtitles (Yay! Subtitles  numbers), if you were to be in charge of subtitling the Marvel movies, what would you have subtitled IM2 and IM3?

IM2 is a little harder to do than 3, but maybe something like Echoes, since Tony's public revelation brought Ivan out and he wants revenge for his fathers death in poverty (an "echo" caused by the actions of Howard), the development of War Machine and Hammer's drones (another echo of his going public, as well as his refusal to hand over his armor to the US government), etc.

IM3 I might have gone for Extremis, if I wanted to go for an obvious   major non-spoiler plot point; Demons, if I wanted to go a little more abstract, playing off of Tony's flashbacks and fear of losing Pepper (his demons), Aldrich's demons of his Extremis use, his disabilities, his hatred of Tony, and growing megalomania, Pepper's demons of dealing with Tony's paranoia, etc. Plus, it's a semi-reference to "Demon in a Bottle"
Actually, you know what, screw "Iron Man: Extremis". I'm going with "Iron Man: Demons". </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Movie-Comic connection: Ultron origins [POTENTIAL SPOILERS] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-14 07:47:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was poking around on the Marvel wiki reading pages and stuff, and I decided to poke around on Ultron's pages and they all read that he was created by Hank Pym...except one: Ultron from Earth-555326 (Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow animated film)

In that universe, "Iron Man created Ultron so that the Avengers could retire. However, ...every time [Ultron] tried to help people out, he realized they kept on getting back in trouble again. Ultron became more controlling of the Human race by destroying its armies and police and completely taking over."

With the infamous Avengers JARVIS-Tony animatic scene hinting that it is Tony, not Hank, that makes Ultron (especially since Hank doesn't "exist" yet, as it were), it does kind of hint toward a similar origin for the MCU's Ultron.

And, though it is very similar in all incarnations, the glimpse of Ultron shown in the teaser does look quite similar to the [555326 versions "head"](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121011212913/marveldatabase/images/thumb/f/fa/Ultron_%28Earth-555326%29.jpg/411px-Ultron_%28Earth-555326%29.jpg).


And this might be a bit of a stretch, but, if you notice, his chest piece is a triangle, like the Mk VI armor that got Joss'd in Avengers because Joss didn't like the triangle?
Like I said, probably just coincidence, but you never know... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My answer to this is "repeatedly". Like just a few minutes ago, I was looking at movies coming up in 2018 (it's a whole bunch of animated stuff, plus Amazing Spider-Man 4), and I was flipping through my calendar (I have them listed there, because I'm a nut) and saw that my birthday was marked and thought "What movie is this? It's not listed here." and it said "my 27th birthday" and it hit me that in 2018, I'm going to be bloody 27 when Amazing Spider-man 4 comes out.

Also, a little while back, I was listening to Smooth (the Santana/Rob Thomas song) and for shits and giggles checked the release date. It's 1999. That song came out when I was 8. It's been around for over half of my life.

	<TITLE> Ladies of Reddit: what is wrong with being "too nice"? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-04 06:45:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Disclaimer: I'm really not intending to come off as an NG^TM here.

Often, I'm told I'm nice.
And, actually, a girl lost interest in me because I was "too nice."
And my second and most recent GF broke up with me for the same reason.

The one that lost interest said that I was "too nice" because:
"When we hung out and stuff it felt like I could do no wrong 
and you were ok with it and by being so nice and understanding I kept pushing it and seeing how much I could get away with"


Isn't that one of the major pieces of a lasting relationship, that you accept the other person, flaws and all? So, if they mess up, they're only human, so why should you get upset at them (I'm also not really one to get upset, mad or angry about anything, really)

And the ex said that, in part, because I was complimenting her all the time and that I was wanting to spend too much time with her and that I was talking to her too much.

I also always do my best to treat them as equals, asking their opinion about things, like where to eat, where to go/what to do that day, etc.

And when I'm in a relationship, I dive in, head first. All the free time I can spend with them, I do. I talk to them constantly. All that good stuff.

If things were reversed, I would hold on to her like there's no tomorrow.


So, ladies, I guess what I'm getting at is, what is wrong with a guy being "too nice" and wanting to be with you as much as he can, etc. etc.?

What all officers are part of the bridge staff? What ranks are they?

	<TITLE> Future game developer proposals </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-29 08:35:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Back in May, Game Informer put out a list of "dream developers" of Star Wars games, before EA got the exclusive deal (though the EA Partners program developers haven't been ruled out...). (link: https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/05/04/lucasarts-licenses-developer-wishlist.aspx)

Since EA now holds exclusive rights (and DICE is already developing ~~BF3~~ Battlefront 3 (*that's* not gonna get confusing...)), I poked through who EA owns and who could do what, so, here's my list:

* I loved Ep I: Racer. And seeing as how Criterion Games (NfS and  Burnout), they are in prime placement to do a new podracing came. I mean, for the N64, E1R was gorgeous. Imagine what they could do with their in-house engines. Or even use Frostbite 3 to make podracers take damage and such (panels flying off, etc.) and have both "preset" racers, but also customized racers. Maybe you play as a wannabe racer, starting in the slums of Taris and working your way up, making money, sponsors, etc. Sort of NASCAR: Star Wars.  

* I'd give Visceral Force Unleashed 3 and the Jedi Knight series. I loved Devil's Cartel, personally. And people seem to love Dead Space. And since they both have an "upgrade" mechanic, as does the TFU series, it's right up their alley.

* Branching into the EA Partners program, I'd give Crytek the Jedi Knight series and Star Wars: 1313. Either them or Valve.

* Rogue Squadron and Empire at War are tricky ones. But I'd say have a sub-team of DICE develop it, since they have mastered the vehicle mechanic. Use the vehicle part of Frostbite 3 for Rogue Squadron 4 and maybe bring in some former Ensemble Studios folks for help with EaW. The ships actually break apart when the get damaged. That just screams FB3.

Requirements: * HDMI capable * preferably composite slots * 36"-42" range * no more than $450

Any suggestions?

(Sidenote: I was looking at a 39" Sharp (LED, 1080p, 60Hz, HDTV) for $350, but I've been told Sharps aren't good for gaming. Thoughts?)

	<TEXT> Am I the only one not getting why there is so much XBox One hate going around?

Most gamers have good, stable Internet connections, no?
So why is the whole "once a day check in" such a big deal?

And so what if the Kinect is always active? You're easy enough to track anyway. Have a modern cellphone? A credit card? A car? You can be tracked by the government by those too. 
And, frankly, I like the idea of targeted advertising. Instead of ads for NBA 2015 and Hostel 6, I'll get ads for Halo 6, Watch Dogs 2, trailers for Avengers 2, etc.
If TVs could do targeted advertising, that would be awesome. No more makeup commercials or such bullshit. Nothing but movie trailers, GEICO, State Farm and Farmers ads, and infomercials. (I 3 you, r/wheredidthesodago)

And does anyone really go over to a friends house to play games anymore, when you can have a full-size screen to yourself and you can talk to your friend via the Internet; plus, you save gas.

So, please, can someone tell me why there is so much XB1 hate going around? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Regarding "A concise list..." </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-07 05:31:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I read "A concise list..." and while I don't necessarily agree with it, I have no problem with the restrictions on selling, lending, renting and trading. Since I have not ever sold any of my games, I never lend to anyone (since I don't trust people), I haven't rented in years and I've never traded games with people, it is all a big moot point.

Also, most of my games were bought new, often launch day, and if I'm late to a game (e.g. GTA4) I buy the "collection", which is the game and all DLC in one box for $30 or less.

And the Kinect detection can be custom set, so privacy concerns are null, not that I had any to begin with.

Also, I've never gone more than a few hours without Internet connection.
The one time my 360 had connection issues was that the Ethernet ports on my router "blew out" after a power outage. The WiFi still worked, though, which, since the One has a built-in WiFi antenna the Ethernet thing becomes a non-issue.


So, tell me, why is the XBox One so terrible?

Addendum: I also love the whole "XBox On" capability the One has. I've more than once said to myself, and others that I wished, with the Kinect, I could turn on my XBox.

Addendum 2: What's the big deal with the DRM issues? As long as you don't pirate games and shit, it's a non-issue. And, really, any more, with internet-capable consoles, who goes over to a friends house to play videogames? That's what XBox Live is for. If you play on the same console, you're dealing with a splitscreen , making everything, at minimum, half the size things should be, when, thanks to the Internet, you can have a whole screen to yourself, while you two play the same game over XBox Live. </TEXT>

They said it was going to be picked up on Friday of last week, so it couldn't possibly be.

As I got closer, I looked at the license plate.
And sure enough, it was Boris.
I had just enough time to be able to snap three photos of him on the last leg of his journey.

I'm also a Trekkie, Wars-ie, Brony (not hardcore), gamer, reader, writer, internetter, TV buff, movie buff, music lover (all sorts), trivia nut (like stuff that could let me win big on Jeopardy), etc., etc.
I've been to 3 ST Cons in Vegas, and, yes, I dressed up.
I'm peripherally into sports, mainly basketball and college football, since that's really the only two things we have in my area. Though I do enjoy playing my copy of NCAA Football 2005 that came with my original XBox. (I occasionally go on a bender and play it for a few days straight.) (By "peripherally", I mean, "Yay, they won." -changes channel-/"Aw, they lost." -changes channel-)

I'm shy, tend to be introverted, but I can be an extrovert in the right circumstances.

I'm in South Texas, but from the San Francisco Bay Area by birth.

Um...I can't really think of anything else ATM...

(Sorry if this is super shitty. I've never been good at talking about myself. I'm a lot better when prompted with specifics.) </TEXT>

It's only been 10 days (give or take), but it feels like several weeks or a month, and I'm missing her terribly. Pretty much, whenever my mind has an idle moment, she pops in. I REEEEEALLY want to send her a message/text telling her that I miss her, but she said she wanted no communication and that she'd contact me first, which would be the end of the "radio silence".

Should I go ahead and message her and hope for the best, or should I stay quiet and just hold on and wait for her to talk to me? Help me, Reddit!

tl;dr: I miss a girl a lot and want to send her a message, even though we agreed to not communicate for a little while. Should I send her one telling her I miss her? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm 21 and I'm semen-phobic. Always have been. When I was younger and had wet dreams, I would always have to wipe down completely, change pajamas, all that, and I would really feel "clean" until I showered.

And whenever my ex-GF and I would...do stuff and I'd finish in her mouth or on her, I'd need to wait a while (like a half-hour plus) before I could kiss her again, so the saliva would was away all the cum (or so my brain thinks). And I'd only be comfortable snuggling with her after we showered and washed the cum off of her chest, even though we'd wiped it off.

So, in short, any tips to get over my semen-phobia?

(P.S.: I didn't mention masturbation, as I don't. [I have before a few times, but I never really got anything from it]) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> e.g. Halo's Mombasa Tether:

"The support structure surrounding and anchoring the tether could not exist as designed in this particular concept. This is because quantum mechanics explains that it is not possible for a solid to exist that has sufficient compressive strength to maintain structural integrity. That is, even while being built, the support structure would spectacularly explode outward at the base under its own weight. With no underlying support structure left, the support rings would pancake and the whole tower will come crashing down. The orbital tether itself is a possible concept, and models for orbital elevators that lack such support frames are far more likely."

I looked at the disc and, on the data side, it has a big milky white splotch that extends inward to the "finger hole". It's not shiny or (as far as i can tell) grooved, making it seem like a whole section of the data has been erased or something.

Anyone know what I'm talking about and, if so, how do I fix it? Or do I have to fork out $60 for a whole new disc?
Also, what could have caused the splotching? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sweat. A lot. And I sit. A lot. And I have occasionally gotten a red mildly painful rash in my groin area, which disappears promptly. Buy for the past week (-ish) I've had a red itchy rash that just will not go away.

Doesn't hurt or smell. It's not scaly or have any bumps.
It's just red skin and itches like fuck.

Is it just a sweat rash or might it be a bacterial infection of some sort? (I do tend to rewear undies for multiple days in a row (as I'm sure many of you did in college) but have never had any reaction before) Or is it just a bad sweat rash that some corn starch or Gold Bond should take care of?

(I wear briefs and, more often than not, the sides of the undercarriage panel tend to be wet with sweat. Not sure if this might help, but it couldn't hurt.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Especially since playing New Vegas I've wanted to go (well, back to) Las Vegas and do a "New Vegas tour" of Las Vegas and the surrounding areas (Nipton, Goodsprings, Boulder City, etc), and, since MW3, I've wanted to do tours of Berlin, Hamburg and (return to) London and do those cities MW3-style, and so on and so forth.

Long story short, has anyone else wanted to do one of these and, if so, in an utterly and completely hypothetical situation, if a New Vegas/MW3/other game tour was set up, would you be interested? </TEXT>
