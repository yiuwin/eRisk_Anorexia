	<TEXT> Julian is serving a dark Lord who has same powers as our hero Barry, but he's more powerful right now. Joe is one of the leads of order that stop all the beings with power who serve this dark lord (ministry). Our hero has a great friend who is very intelligent Caitlyn who loves Ron(nie), but he's MIA. Their another worthy best friend is someone who can enter the speedforce (wield sword of gryffindor) Cisco. Jay is someone who is extremely experienced and powerful in that magic (and as someone pointed out, played by 2 people). Iris is main love interest with a weird sibling. While HR is Gildroy Lockhart. Harry was another father figure who kinda left him in the middle (guess).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> For those who are confused about or are asking who's fastest between RF   Zoom. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-21 11:06:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Take on both and you will realize, zoom was a mass murdering maniac who got speed and used it as just another tool to make the world suffer for what the world did with him. His knowledge of both speedforce as well as science are fairly limited, he's reckless and even though he's supposed to be a fellow science nerd, he's nowhere near close to Wells. Only knowledge of time he has is from his experimenting with time   speed. 

RF on the other hand, is a skilled scientist. Yes, I said scientist because not only he recreated particle accelerator accident twice (once for himself   then for Barry), he recreated it to fail. It's hard to design something, but it's even harder to design something that should fail exactly the way you want it to. He could have stolen Barry's speed but he was experienced enough to realize that that would wear out. He had the speed equation so he could even make velocity drugs but he might have known or predicted the addiction. The best thing he could do was recreate particle accelerator and get his own powers but by that way he would have changed the timeline forever as the flash would never been have created; so he understood the side effects of changing the timeline. He couldn't rush the development of particle accelerator or Tachyons because that would also affect the course of the timeline. He knew Rip Hunter so he knows how to hide from  time masters. He knows about time wraiths. He has the smallest stride among Flash, Zoom and himself so even though he had very low speedforce, he was still faster. He has brains that might equal to Wells and experience of time and speedforce of that equals Jay Garrick. Yet he waited 15 years because nature had to carry its course. So bottom line, you don't wanna mess with the Reverse Flash. No go subscribe to r/reverseflashtv. 

Peace out. </TEXT>

I could kill you right now. 

(**vibrates hand*) so easy. 

What wouldn't I have given, to have you like this before; all those times! 

So helpless. 

But fate. Its tricky. Isn't it? 

I come here to destroy you; and to get home, I gotta be the one who creates you. 

But I will say, it's been an education. 

Watching you grow up all those years, science fairs   soccer games! 

No hint, no sign, no trace of the man you'll be one day for whom I have nothing but hate.

And to be clear, nothing is forgiven. 

There will be our agony. And I promise you Barry Allen, that you'll die. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because we Arrow fans are not getting a good show so we have been bashing them and they know at this point if we get disappointed by season 5 probably we'll just stop watching instead of complaining. Because let's face it, we are all sick and tired of this shit-ship. But on the other hand, they gave olicitards almost 2 seasons worth of material and with that much radioactive exposure, they all have gone meta and have raised their expectations about the ship. If they mishandle the shit-ship, olicitards are gonna start bashing other DCCW shows like The Flash and Supergirl (I know you guys believe me on this one). Same thing happens if they just stop the show after season 5 because tnen olicitards will have nothing to go on. They can't kill queen Fefe (Imagine the disaster ; all the actors posts and inboxed filled with threats and bashing with bad career rep). The best way is to kill Oliver Queen, and bring in the Oliver from Flashpoint who doesn't give jack shit about what Fefe says and also is funny, light hearted like the comic Green Arrow. Hell, they can make him however they want because "Flashpoint". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I took a cab today and was just chatting with driver. He asked me if I had a phone with the logo of apple on it. I told him no, it costs much and frankly I couldn't have the luxury of buying one. I told him how much it costs. Then he told me one of his previous customers left a phone like that in his ride accidentally. He kept it as it is expecting the owner would call. But it eventually ran out of juice and he didn't know what to do with it. So he said he will wait for like a week or so, if nobody contacts him, he will sell it to someone. And now I want to buy it, but the funniest thing is when I showed him pics, he recognized it as iPhone 6s. And I can't buy it because now he wants to sell it to at least half the price. Damn


tl;dr : cab driver found iPhone, doesn't know it's prize. I tell him. Now want to buy from him but can't as even half price is also expensive. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just hear me out, ok. 

Next time Barry goes into the speedforce, he says he wants to see the speedforce, so the speedforce appears in the form of, yeah you guessed it, The Bolt. To give speedforce 101,he tells Barry that he is The Fastest man alive without the speedforce in his system. He was born fast, faster than anyone else. And that the speedforce tested him before giving access to the speedforce. And then how came to realize that he is speedforce, and like there is life force in everything, there is also, the speedforce. And Barry also has to make few tough decisions in order to understand speedforce. 

And after Barry leaves speedforce, the background voice says "you should prepare him well, you know I'm gonna need him one day." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I shot an arrow(Arrow) into the air, 

It fell to earth, I know not where;

For, so swiftly it flew, the sight 

Could not follow it's flight. 



I breathed a song (canary) into the air, 

It fell to earth, I know not where;

For who has sight so keen and strong, 

That it can follow the flight of song?



Long, long afterward, in an oak (Roy) 

I found the arrow, still unbroke;

And the song, from beginning to end, 

I found again in the heart of a friend (Dig). 

I have a bit of hope. 
Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reverse flash originated in future but his first mention is in 21st century because he got his name Reverse Flash in 21st century by Cisco. It suits because while everything happens normally for everyone, for reverse Flash it almost literally happens in reverse. Plus Barry created gideon in future, or he will create gideon but now when he creates gideon he will know exactly what to name her because he met her before he created her. </TEXT>

So might they actually introduce wally as the kid Flash in the flashpoint timeline? This gives a wonderful twist, it makes a lots of fans happy   this way they can keep wally from being kid flash for like another season or two. Also it gives plenty of character growth for the actor like it did with Harry. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Because of all the Flash fuck-ups near the Big Belly Burgers, the franchise had bad publicity. Then one day, a Time traveller comes for the most favourite food of his life, the old triple-B. He just wants to have a beautiful burger with grease and salt, but Barry sees him   starts fighting. And the whole place is in ruins because of the timeline-fuckup-thingy. One moment he's just a Flash-fan trying to have his favourite food, next moment he gets attacked by his idol out of fucking nowhere. This makes triple-B go out of business   it makes him so mad. That's how they become enemies, rivals, opposites of one another. </TEXT>
