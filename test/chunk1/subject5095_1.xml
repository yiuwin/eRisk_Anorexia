	<TEXT> I think the first question is key:  does administration know exactly what is going on in your classroom in regards to these gangs?  Your admin has to be aware and you have to be clear with each other what is expected.

Secondly, you do have to have an understanding with the students about what this is all about for them.  In other words, what is in it for them if they do well in your class?  What is their incentive?  Whenever I had gang members in my class, that was always the key -- they needed a reason to care about the class (English).  What is the importance of your subject for life after high school?  How important is a high school diploma?  What will your course do for them?  Otherwise, they'll always feel like they are just wasting their time.  Sort of the same questions adult teachers ask at inservices.  Everyone wants to know what is in it for them.  If you feel like you're wasting your time, you'll act out.  Teens are no different from adults in that regard. </TEXT>
