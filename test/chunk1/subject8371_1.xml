	<TEXT> Yes, I agree, but the chances of him actually killing a bad guy are less than 50% at the beginning of the game, and I must admit, those chances do increase the further in we go. At the same time, the chances of him staying alive might decrease, causing him to act drastically and killing the...Jailor in order to revive the invest. Not a fair trade. 

The chances of killing a useful role to kill are so small to begin with, it doesn't seem like it would be too much of an issue to add the ability to kill NI roles, too. Hypothetically, of course. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I beg to differ. The most useful role in the game is the jailor. He is a TP, TI, TS and TK in one role.

TP Aspect: Can protect known towns (most notably Mayor) from any harm except for jester hauntings.

TI Aspect: Can ask for roles and has the ability to write down claims. Be careful though, one wrong step and he could become

TK Aspect: Pretty much a vig, but can go through Night Immune's and instead of suicide after executing a town he just no longer has the ability to execute.

TS Aspect: Can roleblock everyone and everything, including Witch. Same effects as escort if RBing an SK without executing, same with WW on full moon.

And the ret? Can revive one townie from the dead. No kills, no investigations, no protection. Sure he can prove a townie, but if he dies N1 or 2? Nadah. </TEXT>
