	<TEXT> I'm sorry about your breakup, they are always soul crushing . It is important to keep in mind that Being this sad is only temporary and you will feel better eventually. However if you binge during this hard time it is going to lead to feeling worse for longer.
My advice is to turn this hard time into a way to focus your energy on your eating and gain the feeling of control you have lost from the break up back with your eating behaviour.

Most importantly allow yourself to be sad and grieve the loss of your relationship but know it will pass and take comfort in knowing that you can still control your eating .

Lots of love :)

	<TEXT> For me being thin means not becoming my mother. It took me a long time to recognise that becoming my mum is the thing that terrified me the most. 

Being thin means not becoming someone I hate. </TEXT>
