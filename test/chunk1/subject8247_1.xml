	<TEXT> This is one of the top questions I've been asked as an atheist. 
Let's start with the assumption that ethics existed before the creation of religion. Your question to why religion was needed to come and restate them is quite understanding. People can chose to not follow these ethics. Some may not even understand them. That's why some intelligent individual decided to invent religion. 
The second possibility is that there was no ethics to begin with and it was created by religion, which was created by one or more intellectuals. And now since we do know how what is good and bad to us, there is no need for religion.  </TEXT>
