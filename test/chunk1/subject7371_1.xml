	<TEXT> Don't stage his murder, stage finding him. Take him back to the park in the early morning hours and call the cops. Not only will you be off the hook for previously finding him and failing to notify anyone, but you'll be seen as a hero for finding these other kids as well. Think of the families who need closure for the kids they didn't find. Jared is very lucky. Take care OP and make the right decisions right now. Your son is depending on you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Phillippines. December 2001. Two schoolmates and I traveled there to meet with one of their grandparents for the holidays. En route to their provence, we were 15 minutes late for our train. Shortly thereafter, word comes over the loudspeaker that our train was commondeered by members of Abu Sayyaf, who then proceeded to blow it up. Zero survivors. When I think of this occassion I feel elated. Why? For the mere fact I'm alive. Happy Holidays. </TEXT>

I've contemplated many things, however, being raised by an autistic parent (let alone single parent), what an experience it must have been. Great read and Happy Holidays. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in your shoes at 25. However I was also responsible for my lady and our two small children under the age of five. At one point I realized I had to stop chasing MY dream and do what was necessary for my life in whole. Dreams don't pay the bills.  I'm not sure what your situation was during your education, but dispite being from an affluent family,  I still had to hold down two jobs to afford the luxuries in my life. I eventually got a bachelor's in business( I'll spare you the details). In any case, once the schooling was done, I continued to work shit jobs until I was able to save up for enough to get back to where I initially wanted to be. I'm now 29 back chasing MY dream. As daunting as it may be, you're never too old to do anything. It's all about getting your mind in the right place. You have to work extremely hard to find your way out right now my dude. But please believe, life does work out. You just have to put forth the effort, no matter what.  </TEXT>
