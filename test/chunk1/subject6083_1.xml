	<TEXT> Hey everyone! I'm not a depressed person, and whenever things are down, I don't have too much trouble cheering myself up, whether that is listening to some rap music, watching some NBA games on TV, or just going out for walks (though that will stop soon because of cold weather).

I'm 18, male. This is my 7th/final year in the same school. I've always had friends there; I was never a neglected student by any means. But for the past 2 months, I have noticed my social circle has been "pushing" me away. These are all guy friends. Here are a few examples:

1) They call me weird and awkward for the most meaningless things. And whenever someone else in the group does the same thing, they laugh and pass it off.

2) My closest friend in the group has been getting extremely sarcastic with me nowadays. Now we've always had this kind of relationship since Day 1, where we give each other shit for nothing, but always in an obviously friendly manner. But recently he's been stepping it up a notch, like calling me out as a "reject" while we're all sitting at a table, or even being sarcastic in front of people WE BOTH JUST MET! I'm extremely against putting your friends down in front of new people. He also gets really uncomfortable now whenever I talk about stuff that matters, like schoolwork, family, friends, relationships, etc.

3) They have stopped inviting me to some of their events, even birthdays. And whenever they do, I feel like they always take advantage of me since I'm the only one who has a driver's license. I never muster up the courage to say "no" whenever they ask for a lift. Any advice on that as well?

My main question here is how do I make new friends? These next few days I can only imagine myself sitting alone at a lunch table, just waiting for the hour long break to pass by -- and trust me, if you have nothing to do, it takes a looooooong time ahhah

I don't know what to talk about whenever I meet new people. They say always talk about THEM not yourself, and smile, but I never get them to open up, always 2-3 word answers. There's this one dude I talk to sometimes, we share a common interest, basketball. Whenever we talk about that, the convo never stops. But once it's done and it's back to "small talk"......... well...... hahaha

Like I mentioned earlier, I'm not sad or down at all. But I do feel lonely most weekends, because of a lack of good non-toxic friends. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The last 2k game I played is 2k13. One thing that I noticed is the unrealistically high field goal percentages in the game. Every 12 minute quarter game I played, even on Hall of Fame, the final score would always be something like 150-144, with each team having 65+ FG%. Every game. Once I even ended a half with 88 points. Every shot would go in.

Playing on Default sliders, not casual. It wasn't this bad in 2k12. </TEXT>

2) When she tells me she went clubbing this past weekend and she met a really hot guy and they made out. I don't know, I never know how to react when a girl says it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, you're not hating on him. Sorry about that.

I still support him because I have been depressed before. It was most likely less severe than Wings (in love with best friend who didn't like me back, wouldn't affect me nowadays but hey I was stupid lol).

So from my experience, my friends would constantly support me but I would always shut them down. It's normal behavior. I honestly think a year or two from now he'll be a different person. </TEXT>

If you donated money and you regret, you should've given it more thought. This isn't the first time he has quit (well, in this case, he considered, he hasn't quit).

I didn't donate any money but I still fully support him, and if you don't, stop wasting time hating on someone you only know through a screen. Read a book. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My theory is the game doesn't care how well you do. Only Ellis' stats are taken into consideration. And you will ALWAYS be drafted after him.

So for example, if Ellis scored like 2 points and gets 1 rebound, he will be drafted in the 20s. And regardless if you had a great showcase or not, you will be drafted after him.

And on the other end of it, if Ellis had a great game, like 20 points and a good number of assists and rebounds, he will be drafted early, and that opens more doors for your player.

Again, this is just my theory, I don't even own the next-gen console/game. I'm only basing my thoughts on what I've watched and read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't touched a gaming console since I sold mine about 8 months ago. I loved playing Minecraft with friends, but I don't like watching it.

I used to watch every one of Woody's videos before this Minecraft thing of his started. Whenever I see them in my sub feed I just don't click on them. Let the man do whatever he wants. Personally, I can live without my daily dose of Woody.

Lol I dunno man I support Woody, he's helped me through tough times. I've sent him several Mail Monday messages without any replies, but it's understandable; the guy has a million subs.

I think the people complaining about it should just chill lol. </TEXT>

I honestly can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not lol. I'll go with yes since this is such a non-issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm by no means sad. I'm quite satisfied with my place in the world, but I have no motivation to get up and lose some weight. I'm 6 ft, 175 pounds. I'm not fat, not thin, but I have quite a bit of flabs. I can eat a lot of food and not put a pound of weight on my body, although I know this habit of eating whatever whenever will fuck me up in the long run.

Is there any legit motivation anyone can give me to get off my ass and head to the gym? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, from experience, I don't think I would like it. When some older TV sitcoms reached a milestone episode, they liked showing "best moments" from previous episodes. They were my least favourite episodes. My reaction was always something along the lines of "hmm, nothing new to see here, I've already seen these bits." I imagine it would be the same thing for a podcast.

If it's just a small segment of the show, like a topic, I wouldn't mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the way I think of this. Let's take one host off PKA and see how the show goes:

PKA without Woody. I don't see a good show happening with that circumstance. He comes up with a lot of the topics and makes the show go on.

PKA without Wings. Same as with Woody, but for a different reason. Wings makes me laugh, a lot. Love him on the show.

PKA without Kyle. The only reason I can be OK with this is because we've already had a dozen or so episodes without him on the show, and they turned out great in my opinion. He's a big plus though, I prefer him to be present.

PKA without Lefty. I've grown to like him. He has good work ethic and can take a joke (many, as a matter of fact lol). It's doable, but like Kyle, the show wouldn't be the same without him.

In MY perfect world, PKA would stay with the current hosts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started watching PKA since it first started, but I was on and off with it. I've seen every episode since 110-ish, and my favourites are 131 and 132. They talk about current events, TV shows, random stuff, and I love every minute of those two episodes. There's no guest in either.

What are your favourite PKA episodes with no guest? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I agree, I've been depressed as well, and while it was just because a girl I was obsessed with didn't like me back, it killed my motivation to do anything, even sometimes brushing my teeth in the morning. It was a pretty insignificant reason to be depressed though, in retrospect. The cure is time, and surrounding yourself with good people, something I failed to do. </TEXT>
