	<TEXT> In light of the recent major numbers in terms of viewers, as well as the changes to gambling, do you think that Counter Strike is on the descent in popularity or that this was just an anomaly and the eSport will continue to grow. Do you also think that eSports as whole will continue for a long period of time like other sports or will die out in the near future.
Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My thoughts on why the nV - Gambit game went like it did. [Spoilers] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-10 23:22:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> nV lost 16-10 and although the score line was close, I don't think a single round won by nV looked like it was deserved by them. Gambit, mainly helped by mou who dropped over 20 kills in the first half, outaimed and outplayed nV.

nV to me thought like they were trying to re-invent the wheel. They are known for their explosive force buy fast mentality but that's what caused a lot of problems. On T side twice they created the strategy of a literal matchmaking strat of 'SMG B Rush', with after the loss on the pistol, the force and the Eco making the score 3-0. nV bought 3 MAC-10s, a Tec-9 and a P90 and proceeded to do as stated above. Needless to say the plan failed dramatically and they were cut down by the superior weapons of their opposition. The only positive I could see of this strat was that they were able to buy on the next round, a full AK/Galil by coming out from them with a planned smoke execute, but they were also outmatched by gambit. 
Later in the half nV continued to preform their MAC-10 strat, with 4 of them and 1 AK. As you may guess it didn't work, with mou putting in some incredible shots and holds.

On the half turn, things looked good for the notsohappy Frenchmen as it was quickly turned into a 4-2 in their favour. However things spiralled out of control quickly as it fell onto apex to preform a 2-1 clutch to give nV the pistol round, a scenario that never should of occurred in the first place. 
 A lot of the mistakes came from the positional plays and unnecessary peaks from the nV side, shown when they lost the round after the pistol, with DEVIL shining out as the main problem (ha ha ha) due to his frankly questionable acts and plays.

The game came to a close with the potential for a nV comeback, as a close clutch by Adren and according to natu "Gambit's mvp the smoke' nearly gave gambit the map early if not for a classic 2014 kennyS shot who was luckily able to stop the very smart moves by Adren.

TL;DR although the game was somewhat close regarding to the score, nV barely scraped out their rounds whereas gambit were able to convincing take consecutive rounds away from the baguette boys. I am a fan of nV, I have been since LDLC and would like to see them qualify, but this result makes me fear that the result against Immortals was either a fluke, or bad signs for the rising Brazilian talent. </TEXT>
