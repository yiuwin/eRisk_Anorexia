	<TEXT> Watch Afflicted  if you havent that was my favorite one so far. I enjoyed how it showed the suffering and process of turning into a vampire, most vampire movies just have the people instantly turn into vampires. The first time I watched it I was blown away. For sure the best found footage movie i've seen besides The blair witch project. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am trying to figure out what this movie is called where this guy steals from a creepy gypsy and then he is cursed by  her and keeps seeing her where ever he goes. Theres one part I specifically remember where he sees a pie in a kitchen and the inside starts moving and a hand comes out of the pie I think. I know this is vague but its all I remember, any help I would appreciate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely watch The Taking Of Debrah Logan. I thought Afflicted was the best out of all the found footage movies I've seen. It was cool seeing someone go through the process of turning into a vampire and struggling with it instead of turning right into a vampire like most vampire movies. The two guys in the film actually wrote and directed it themselves, pretty impressive for there first/only film.  </TEXT>
