	<TEXT> I'm grateful for any feedback! This is not a plein-air drawing, but made from a photo I took over two years ago on a holiday in Denmark (with many changes, though). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think "Tschechei" is more widespread in the East of Germany, I have friends in Saxony and Brandenburg who always use "Tschechei" while in the West (close to the Dutch border, in my case) that's virtually unheard of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As for the specific case of sandstone subjected to great heat, we know very well how this plays out from the fire of the Dresden Frauenkirche after the bombing in the Second World War. The church outlived the destroyed centre by two days, but its wood-clad interior was burning. The heat caused the sandstone to expand and crack, and eventually one of the eight main pillars supporting the dome collapsed. Thus all the weight suddenly shifted to the opposite side, where further supports cracked and within seconds the entire construction came down. </TEXT>
