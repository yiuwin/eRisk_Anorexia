	<TEXT> I really enjoy it. However, I think if you really want to go on it, you should just get a fastpass early in the day. it makes the lines about 10 times shorter and you still get to go on it. I'm not the type of person who is going to wait that long for anything but if you absolutely have to go on it and fastpasses aren't avaliable, you should just wait it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason a lot of people hate WOC is because it has no story or deeper meaning. It's just projections of Disney Movies on water. It still is beautiful but not what people would expect of Disney. I honestly think that Fantasmic is better. However, if I'm in Paradise Pier at the moment the show is going on, I'll stop and watch for a few minutes. I don't hate WOC but It's not my favorite show at Disneyland. I hope you understand why certain people don't like it. Oh and not to mention they close Screamin for it. No more riding it at night :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. I would count on the parks being pretty crowded.
2. I don't think you should buy a ticket for that day. It won't give you a lot of park time plus those tickets are very expensive. It'll give you more time to settle it.
3.That kind of depends. Since you have infants I don't reccomend going to any super fancy places so you won't have to reserve much.
4. Anything at Disneyland can be memorable. Just have a good time and it will be perfect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are some disneyland secrets/trivia/tips
1. The fire station on main street used to be Walt's apartment
2. The skull above the skeleton on the bed in Pirates is a real human skull
3. The track you see when you're on Mark Twain or Columbia was from a ride called "Rainbow Caverns Mine train"
4. The truck and the minecart in the outdoor line for Indiana Jones are real props from the Raiders of the Lost Arc and The Temple of Doom.
5. There is a basketball half-court at the top of the Matterhorn 
6. Despite whatever cast members say, the small circle on the floor next to the castle is not the center of the park.
7. When you're in the boiler room in the tower of terror listen closely to the sounds made by the machinery. You may hear some
creepy things.(I won't spoil it.)
8. In the library of Tower of Terror there are several props from the twilight zone show. (ex. a devil napkin holder thing on top of the back shelf)
9. If you see someone with sunglasses with a cast member, chances are they're famous.

	<TEXT> No matter how crouded it is, you can still find ways to have a good time. The best thing to do it plan it all out. You need to pinpoint what rides will be crouded and when they will. Since you're going in November, chances are Haunted Mansion holiday will be packed. If you absolutely want to go on it, either wait in a long line or try to go early in the morning (opening to 10:00 AM). I suggest making reservations if you are going to eat at Carthay Circle or Blue Bayou. The park will be the most crowded after lunch, so I reccomend doing some smaller rides at that time (ex. Fantasyland rides, BUT not peter pan). If you want to get on good rides be sure to go early because most annual-pass holders don't get to the park very early. Good luck and have fun! </TEXT>
