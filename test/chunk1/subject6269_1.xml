	<TEXT> I'd say whatever is cheaper where you live. Right now I don't think that one of them is significantly better than the other. 
What's good about AMD is FreeSync, a lot cheaper than Gsync, plus usually better driver support for the future.
But if you manage to get a godd deal on either of them, go for it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> UK or Italy? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> A friend and I are planning to go Interrailing next May/June, using the 10 travel days in one month ticket. We live in Portugal and plan on doing a round-trip without any flying. The question that remains is whether we should go visit the UK (and possibly Ireland) or if should go to Italy. In the UK option, the cities we would plan on visiting are London, Edinburgh und maybe Dublin. In Italy, the cities would be Milan, Florence and Rome. We are also planning on visting Madrid and Barcelona, and leaving Portugal and the other one coming back, as we have to go through Spain anyway. Visiting Paris is also not off the table, especially when choosing the UK option.
Thanks in advance for any advice </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, I solved it by setting the RAM to 2133 MHz instead of 2400 (at which I thought it was supposed to be set) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PC won't boot unless I reset CMOS </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So today, a friend of mine who is interested in building a PC himself visited and also wanted to see my own one. After shutting it down, I took out one of the RAM sticks, which I maybe did too early. Anyway, when I tried booting, the fans spun up and all, but the monitor stayed black and the light on my keyboard, which usually is always on when the PC has power, even when shut down, was off. So, I ripped it all out of the case and built it again and also reinstalled the RAM. Now, I don't remember if I had already reset the CMOS now or only later, but it worked, both with and without GPU. I then built everything back into the case and nothing happened on the screen unless i reset the CMOS. After doing so, I can "override boot" to Windows in the BIOS. This is where I am now stuck. I updated/flashed the BIOS with AISuite, but not even the BIOS will boot unless I reset the CMOS. This is where I now need help.
My Motherboard is an Asus Z-170 Pro Gaming, I have updated to the newest BIOS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 650 should definitely be fine. I actually got a 750w from cooler master just to make sure, though now I know it wasn't necessary </TEXT>
