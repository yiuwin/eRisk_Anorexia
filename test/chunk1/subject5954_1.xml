	<TEXT> Hi! I'm quite new to the Magic scene but I'm not quite sure if I know what Prerelease events are and what's happening there.

But I've read about the Dragon's maze prerelease and the fact that you had to go through a maze and the fastest guild won!
But how does this work ? Could someone provide me some details about this awesome maze? Kindest regards! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got some questions before I buy the Rebel Transport.

Can you play all three missions seperately on a 3x3 playmat ?
Are there any ships I need besides the Rebel Transport ? (I own almost every one of them but I mean like 5 X-wing's or so, do I need that ?)
Is there anything else I'll be needing or needing to know?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sharing a program shortcut. (Possible?) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-16 12:37:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sorry in advance if this is in the wrong subreddit but I couldn't think of the best besides this. (Any subred. advice is appreciated!)

Is it possible to share a shortcut online ? For example I have a program on my computer that I want to give people acces to launch over an internet connection. (Also possible for a .batch file ?)

They should only be able to open it but if it's possible to give them acces to the shortcut and only the program that it'll open I'm happy.) I know I can make this a bit possible by a LogMeIn account but that gives them acces to my whole computer. Not what I want.

Any ideas ? Help ?
Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use Bandcamp.com, I'll give you an example how I find the OST's on there:

I want the OST of "Nanatsu no taizai" so I google search "Nanatsu no taizai OST" , I see there's a wikia page so I click on it. There I see information about the artist(s)/Composer and the album's name.

Now I go to bandcamp.com , type in the composer's name (ITC "Hiroyuki Sawano"), the first is the album, I click on it and get redirected to a page to purchase the album or individual tracks.

You can also search by artist name, album name and track name,
I also recommend searching in Itunes cause there are a lot of albums on there! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> WHAT'S THIS ANIME SCENE FROM ? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-07 01:06:10 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Help needed!

A year ago (I think), I saw this anime scne in a youtube video. The whole video was the scne btw and here's how it went: A girl walks into a club, (I thought she had red hair (not ginger, red)) and she starts fighting guards than more guards show up and start shooting her and she's doing all these acrobatic moves (I think she had weapons but not sure) there was also blood quite some, than there was this voice of a guy sitting on top in the club (Like the VIP Area). And they start having this conversation and that's the last thing I remember. 

Now here's the thing: The filming of the fighting was incredibly phenomenal and that's why I want to find it.

Important: There wasn't much color except for the protagonist which was the girl (I guess), lots of different grey, black, (Very black and white in general but with red blood)

If someone knows from which anime this is or the link to the youtube video, would really satisfy my desperation to see the video again!

EDIT: Answer has been found! It was the trailer for RWBY Yellow </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Belgium, EUR] Recommendations for a great camera phone. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> 'sup!

So my Iphone 4S didn't make it today, it was time for an upgrade anyway. I'm looking for a new phone, prefer IOS/Android but here are the key features I'm looking for:

A good camera for photo and/or video! (Min. 8 MP but I want more.)

Being able to run Snapchat,Facebook and a lot of other applications at the same time and being able to switch fast between them. (So a phone with some good RAM!)

Not a complicated interface for updates, IOS has a simple system to update its apps and that's what I want, just going somewhere tapping and it's upgrading all in the background.
Also not complicated for its OS.

And I need to be able to listen to music on it (So extra memory or a micro SD port would be a bonus (but this is not a necessity as I own an MP3 but would be nice!)

Any recommendations ? I haven't been up to date with the latest smartphones so even a reply with what's hot on the market now would be greatly appreciated!
