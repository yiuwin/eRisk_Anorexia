	<TEXT> I don't think so, for when you meet Alduin you have at least 2 shouts and don't forget - if you have played the DLC Dawnguard - Durnehviir says that he will call you "Qahnaarin", if you haven't completed Dragon Rising, besides he also says that he can feel something special about you. Now imagine what Alduin, the World-Eater, first born of Akatosh, a divine creature could say about the only one capable of killing him, he can differentiate someone that have practised the voice to someone with the dragonblood. 

What I can't understand, though, is why Mirmulnir, the dragon in the watchtower, recognises you as Dovahkiin when you kill him, but Durnehviir doesn't.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If there is an explanation elsewhere you can direct me there, I don't mind, but there are somethings that I can't understand:

1 - After Kurisu was killed and he had given up on going back on time, how was the Steins; Gate World Line achieved?

1.1 - I mean, from what I could gather from the Alpha World Line, this line is composed from several threads, but even though they are some what individualised they share the same beginning and the same end, ie begin with the first D-mail ends with Mayuri's death. So what made the paradox possible? Was there a third Okabe that went back on time on the Okabe that just killed Kurisu and saved her? But that wouldn't make sense, I can understand the divided by zero though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Spoilers] Let's talk about Urahara and the lore behind his powers </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-26 16:37:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So as we saw in last chapter, Urahara has released his bankai and, from what I could gather, there are some similarities between Urahara and Guanyin/Avalokitesvara.


I will point out what caught my eye that is the mention of Guanyin, even though mentioned as a man before, in Chinese mythology, it after could be considered as a woman, a man, a creature with both sexes or genderless, **however** she was mostly depicted as a female, just like Uraharas zanpakuto. There's a story of Guanyin and the children of the Dragon King and to summarise it, Guanyin became the tutor of the daughter, Longn, and the son, Shacai, of the Dragon King after she saved his son's life and the Dragon king presented to him the "Pearl of Light" a "precious jewel owned by the Dragon King that constantly shone". Maybe a coincidence, but we could tell that Jinta and Ururu are the children depicted in the story and the Pearl of Light is the Hogyoku.


Besides the two kids that follow Guanyin, there are two warriors that flank her and those are the general Guan Yu and the *bodhisattva* Skanda; even though those two can also be seen protecting some others *bodhisattva*. In my interpretation, I could see general Guan Yu as Tessai, because the general - in life and in fiction - was known for his sense of moral duty, his loyalty and righteousness, also don't forget that Tessai was the captain of the Kido Corps a praised position such as the general's. Meanwhile, Skanda, is Yoruichi - it may come as a surprise for those that immediately google Skanda's name because he is a man, but bear with me. Skanda is portrated wearing an armour - Yoruichi's family heirloom is an armour -, Skanda is the son of a king - Yoruichi is the daughter of the main family of a noble house -, Skanda is portrayed wielding a [vajra](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Vajra.jpg/751px-Vajra.jpg) - which in Sanskrit means thunderbolt, which is her signature move.


There are some things that we could extract from the lore of how his bankai would work, but I'd be speculating even more than I already have. Feel free to make any observations.

Edit: Don't downvote for the sake of downvoting, it doesn't add anything for the matter. I bet that you haven't even read what I wrote. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw a thread where someone said that the unit "m" stands for miles and I said that "m" stands for meters. That person told me it could be both so I said that was highly unlikely to find a unit in the same subject that could either mean one thing or the other. So I did a little research and I found out that "m" used to be used for miles in the UK, but after 1940's or 70's can't recall right now, "m" should only be used for meters.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think that [Knapsack Enhanced](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32847/?) is the best mod for a bag, but I can't install it with the current version of Frostfall. Would I have to downgrade my frostfall or is there an alternative for it?

Edit: Here is what I did: Download Frostfall 3, Campfire, Frostfall 2.6 and Knapsack Enhanced. Install all, say "no to all" if installing frostfall 2.6 after frostfall 3. Load TES5Edit, change Knapsack's master from Chesko_Frostfall.esp to Campfire.esm, close TES5Edit. Uninstall Frostfall 2.6, run the game.

Down side: Knapsack is a bit buggy, only cooking pot worked perfectly if the bag was unequipped and re-equipped (haven't tried with travel axe, though); none of the tents had shown; knapsack will only be available through console commands, if I'm not mistaken. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-12-25 10:24:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It has a good story, for starter, you will easily have fun with the characters, specially the twins and it has a beautiful scenario. Even though each twin has a specific ability, you don't necessarily feel a unique way of combat when you reach the top level - which don't take long if you do side quest along the main quest - I'd love to see more uniqueness from them, [spoiler](#s "in their skill tree, in the end, they are basically the same, I'd wish for Evie to stay more stealth like and Jacob a brute.")

I'd like to point something about the final battle [spoiler](#s "Starrick has one of the most stupid end fights I have ever seen, it was a major turn down. Also the character seemed to be so much potential, but you only see him at the middle of the game and they don't develop that until the very end.")

About the DLC, PC version: I really liked it, except for some bugs, but they were pretty small, at least for me.[spoiler](#s "Evie didn't age well, but I guess India's sun can make people's skin get older faster if no care is applied. Jacob looking fine - except when he was beat up. The story is okay, I really liked the 'fear' that was introduced and playing with the Reaper had that feeling of psychosis. The final battle was better than the main game, imo, but it was poorly executed.")

Question about Jack: We are in the Helix, we are playing with Evie and Jacob, brother and sister basically the same genetic material so changing between one and the other is fine. [spoiler](#s "We find out that Jack is a little boy that was taken from an institution, from probably a single mother - that when killed, told Jack to look for Jacob -, but we can play as him - Jack -, in the same memory that Evie and Jacob share. Is it possible that Jack is Jacob's son or did they implement the Jack thing just because? Jack could be around 20 since Jacob was 20/21 when he and his sister arrived in London.") </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There weren't many things that I disliked in this game, as a matter of fact I really enjoyed it.

The combat system: either I am to dumb to notice or I got used to it that easily because I didn't have any problems with that. Also I didn't use "riposte" not even once, just on the tutorial.

I had some problems in a specific part [spoiler](/s "the mist (Chapter 2)") for there was a bug on the colours and I felt like on the instagram of a really addicted person, if someone in the future is going to read this know that there is no correction for this bug. 

What I disliked was the fact that I can't search in all the sacks, boxes, in the game, they light up when I use my medallion, but for some reason (rocks on the way, furnitures on the way) I can't pick the items in them.

Using an imported save: it really doesn't make that much of a difference, for example [spoiler](/s "I picked Triss in the first game to keep Alvin, if I picked Shani, probably Triss would still be pissed, but that doesn't change much of the game, no one says anything about Alvin, if Siegfried is alive, you'll have a brief encounter with him"); the good thing is that there are some books on the first game that, if you read, you'll already know what they are talking about. This game, as the first, has [spoiler](/s "2 paths, Roche's and Ivoreth's, this time you can't stay neutral, and know that, unlike the first game, choosing one of the sides changes the way you're going to play with quests in chapter 2 and the outcome in 3 - the prologue, though, is still the same. In sum, The Witcher 2 is a game to be played at least twice.")

If you have doubts about books and schematics (potions, bombs, weapons, armour) and when you know if you have them, you'll have to carry them with you, one of the stupidest ideas I've ever seen. If I'm not mistaken, books don't weight, but every schematics have a 0.1 weight and there are a shit ton of schematics and since I'm one that tries to collect all the items even if I don't use them, a part of my weight was dedicated for schematics. For instance, if you have the book "Rites of Midate" and the bookseller is also selling it, you'll see a "black check" over the bookseller's book, if you don't have the book it won't be marked, thus whenever you have **in your inventory** a book or a schematic, it will be checked in the vendor's store. Also, know that most schematics are useless, buy one that is very good and you won't need any other.

Not sure if it's spoiler, but, in doubt, I'll mark it. [spoiler](/s "The scene after credits could have been done in the same way the opening - with Letho in the boat - was done, but instead we didn't have CG and that made me kind of sad, would be awesome to see it in CG. Comparing the ending of the first game with this one, the first one is way much better and, look, in the first one we had CG as well...")

About the story I'd say [spoiler](/s "you either keep loving Triss, or you won't trust her anymore, in the first game she was a part of The Lodge and, as she said, she was giving you selected information and that she didn't lie, but she omitted a lot of stuff, when clearly Geralt tries, or at least the gamer has the available options, to be honest. Right at the beginning of the first game I was okay with her, but as it was going forward I started to feel something weird about her, does she love Geralt? Yes, but she omits a lot of information, she isn't honest with him, and there are some people that warn Geralt about Triss, they never explain why, but as the game go on, at least I had, doubts on the character's behaviour, she's not a bad person though, but I ended the game knowing that Geralt and her can't be a couple. I just hope the Yennefer in the next game proves to be a better lover.")

The witcher 2 8/10, would play it again in a few years, you should give it a shot.


Edit: I'll have to re-edit this. Wait a second

Edit 2: Done, I've forgotten how to hide spoilers in here. </TEXT>

Why did Abigail gave Alvin to the Reverend? I know that there was a "child tax", but didn't she said to the witcher that she would take care of him, or am I being to nave to believe in that?


Does Alvin appear in TW2 or TW3? Is Jacques de Aldersberg an Alvin from a different time and space?

**About the ending**:

Who's that assassin/witcher? Do we know more info about him in the following games?


Also, I'd like to point out that I really enjoyed this game, it took me some time, and a lot of walking, but I made it. Can't wait to play the next one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a sore loser and I'm currently playing TW1 for the first time so I'm gathering as much money as I can, selling every gravel and sweet potato so I can buy all the books so I can understand the lore (I know that some of them I can find for free, but that's not the point), so whenever I intend to play dice poke I save prior any game so if I lose I can re-start the game because I'm afraid that if the NPC starts with x and if he wins 160 orens of me, he won't have x+160, but just the initial x. Should I keep loading, or does the NPC keep the money, at least for the day that I'm playing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1 . He asks for help, asks you to trust him, but still he isn't honest with the priest of Vaermina business.

2 . He makes you his test subject of Vaermina's Torpor, saying that the potion will not work for him since he's a priest of Mara and the torpor would only work for the priest of Vaermina and the unaffiliated.

3 . If asked how he can be certain, he says that exist some risk, but if something happened to you he would do anything he could to prevent anything bad from happening to you

4 . If you have read the book "[The Dreamstrider](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Dreamstride)" as I did you would reply "Forget it! It could kill me!". Then he would answer, that all his research points to the opposite direction, then he wonders if your character would be allowed inside the Dreamstrider (but didn't he said in the other dialogue that the unaffiliated could enter it?) then he says that the worst that could happen is a "bad aftertaste", but he "swear upon Lady Mara that he would never let any harm befall you".

	<TITLE> I'm looking for Redguard mods related </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-11 16:49:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm starting a gameplay with a Redguard, so I'm looking for any mods that would make my gameplay feels like I'm a real redguard. I've started with some weapons from [farinelli](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1346841/?): [shamshir](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60454/?), [bow](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60660/?), [shields](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60788/?) and [unique scimitars](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60896/?). I've also downloaded [Warmonger Armory](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50459/?), by [batmanna](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3501725/?) for armours, but if you know anymore mods with armours related to Redguards, please let me know. There are two house mods for Redguards: [Esterah - Jewel of the Redguard](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63595/?) by /u/morganmarz and [Khune](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59227/?) by /u/Elianora. I haven't searched much yet, but if you want to share any mods related to Redguard I would appreciate a lot. I don't mind if they are as simple as lore friendly books about redguards or even something more complex, anything suits me. Thanks.

Edit: Another Redguard house mods: [House of the Redguard](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54162/?), [House of the Redguard II](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63220/?), a Redguard tent [Alik r Tent](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51061/?). A bit of immersion with [Realistic Redguard](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54342/?) making most of males Redguard to wear the Hammerfell Garb. Not necessarily related to Redguards, but [Air Atronachs](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58537/?) would be more related to where they live, at least I think so.
There is this [Alikr'r Knife (Dagger)](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64679/?).

Edit II: Someone recommended [Bobs Armory Skyrim](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12060/?) since it has some good weapons (personally, I haven't tried those).

Edit III: If you use the mod Gray Cowl Nocturnal - the quest one - you should try [Al-Janna Player Home and Getaway](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68308/?). A house mod for that new land. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why the relation Brook-Robin is practically non-existent? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-04 01:54:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I re-watched some Brook scenes on youtube and Robin is simply indifferent to him, for instance, when he asks if he could see her panties she doesn't reply nor move a muscle of her face. I tried to look in the wikia if there was more info about their relation and it said: "She has not been seen interacting with Brook very much. She stood there emotionless when she met him and she does nothing when Brook asks to see her panties."

Why Oda doesn't develop this relation? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Re)watch and discussion season 1 episodes 1-5 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-27 23:35:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I first came to Reddit I was already waiting for season 3 of Hannibal, so I decided to re-watch some of the episodes of both seasons and maybe discuss with you guys. I've read the discussions of the the first five episodes of season 1 and, unfortunately, my idea to discuss with you just came to me after watching the fifth episodes and noticing some thing that no one commented on the episode discussions, maybe it will make people re-watch the episodes like me.

I would like to talk about the scene that Hannibal and Bella are talking about her illness and the director made us subliminally notice the background behind [the patient](http://i.imgur.com/R3XYcpj.png) and [the psychiatrist](http://i.imgur.com/jSW43fv.png). The background behind Bella is red, red is commonly associated with anger and disturbing feelings, such as hers with her cancer. Hannibal's background is white, some times represented as peace, calm or simply as nothingness, maybe he was trying to make her feel calm, or it just shows that there isn't nothing inside him. After a discussion that visibly Hannibal won, you can see that [he over comes her](http://i.imgur.com/8HX8jpr.png), and once again the director used the curtains to show that there are more white "stripes" than red "stripes". Also, I would like to point out the stag, even though not clear, behind Hannibal.

One thing that was a matter of constant debate is Hannibal's personal library, and that when someone (maybe Will or Abigail) is going to talk with him they climb down the ladder to talk with him. In this very same fifth episode, Will seek Hannibal's advice and during all that time that they were talking about Jack or the killer that turn his victims into angels, Hannibal never steps down of upstairs. Being a library a metaphor for knowledge, I think the director made Hannibal stay up there to show that he feels superior to Will intellectually.

Those are just few things that I noticed from the fifth episode, if anyone bother to join me in this adventure of exploring the scenario and everything about Hannibal, I'll gladly post again, even if someone else post it before me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I searched for any discussion that would bring me an answer about the blank spaces in some aspects of death in Bleach. Actually I only care about (and searched) Neliel Tu Oderschwanck, but let's try Luppi Antenor as well. What would be their aspects of death? Maybe we can guess from their own personality or their resurreccin. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In Turn Back the Pendulum, we can see Aizen explaining how his shikai works - [1](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9/37-316.1/compressed/007.jpg) and [2](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9/37-316.1/compressed/008.jpg). Maybe I'm pushing too much this, but when you're under an illusion, you have to come back to the real world, ie you have to wake up - [1](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9/08-065.0/compressed/_manga_rain_bleach_ch065_18.jpg) and [2](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9/08-065.0/compressed/_manga_rain_bleach_ch065_19.jpg), I would say is the first sign that makes Sousuke and Kisuke rivals. Another point that I would like to raise is that Sousuke knew that Kisuke was something special when he was [promoted as a captain](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9/36-315.1/compressed/bleach_108_binktopia.19.jpg). Then he kept an eye on him - [1](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9/36-315.2/compressed/bleach_107_18.jpg) and [2](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9/36-315.2/compressed/bleach_107_19.jpg). Also, even though Sousuke was, probably, [against the Soul King](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9/48-421.0/compressed/cbleach_421_sleepyfans.19.jpg), he seems to still [want to be understood by Kisuke](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9/48-421.0/compressed/cbleach_421_sleepyfans.20.jpg). Maybe there will be more to come, maybe what I just said is a lot of nonsense with a bit of coincidence, only time will tell. What do you think? </TEXT>
