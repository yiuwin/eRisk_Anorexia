	<TEXT> Idk...although, I agree with you on the probable difficulty of eating this, I also think there is a whole lot of fun in getting to interact with your food on a level such as this. A food like this, should be seen "fun food". Not only does it require you to get your hands a bit oily (hopefully with copious amounts of butter), but you make a dish like this rarely and preferentially with friends. In essence, promoting comraderie and conversation.

As a cook, I understand that most people go out to eat to have everything done for them. But as a cook, I also understand the message represented in rustic cooking. My Nana would of told me to either eat it, or eat shit. It is what it is. </TEXT>

I do agree with you on pretty much every point. Including the beat cops. Its still a pretty common idea (beat cops). I'm guessing that there just isn't as many cops in general these days and that's maybe why shit like this is happening?? As our society becomes more civilized as a whole, perhaps we are also a little more complacent, and forgot some of the safeguards you have presented? Idk, just a thought </TEXT>

It took me a bit, also, to figure out the accents and where they were intended to be from. Even the midget. Although, without looking up the actor, I do feel he may(?) be American. 

Watching movies, as an American (like *Snatch* for example), I tend to get entranced and somewhat super focused to how they are speaking. Although, I know many Scots, and Northern Irish speak English, I find it pretty fucking hard to understand. Kinda like many people from the southern parts of the states. 

Jamaican accents are also often super hard to understand. </TEXT>

Definitely a good way to get a flat, or a fuck up a wheel, for sure!


I've been biking everyday here for a couple years, and apart from one clearly malicious driver (see rant thread January 2016), one crash that was completely my fault, and occasional eye rolls, I've never had a bad experience on a bike.

Somewhat related, never trust cross traffic to stop just because you know they have a stop sign. I had a not very friendly encounter with a car who basically ran their stop sign whilst I was riding at a good clip (47th and Clinton). I had no time to react and plowed into the side of their SUV. Few broken ribs later, I really wished I had taken their info (I am one that doesn't like to hassle others, if not necessary--I blame my adrenaline in this instance). A fellow cyclist caught it on vid, but I can't seem to find it. I'll update the post if I do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really is not so much anger, as it is frustration at how uncompassionate many in this subreddit are. The second homelessness comes up, it's one big circle jerk over-generalizing all homeless as "people who shit on the sidewalks".

I probably worded my original statement rather harshly, but it is still relevant to Portland's changing environment. More so than the occasional person shitting on a sidewalk. Dogs shit on sidewalks, too. And a whole hell of a lot more often too, for that matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I get you. Just one of things that makes gentrification so hard to balance out. There are some great positves to it. And there some equally negative things that come with.

So it goes.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it's great. If you haven't, I couldn't recommend it higher. Unless you have an aversion towards animated movies, pretty sure you'd like it. It breaks down how our psyche works pretty well. On an emotional level, anyways. Just watch it, it's really good:P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the most part, yes. But I would have to gauge to what degree, you deem homelessness, as "widespread" is, here in Portland.

I'm pretty poor, so costs are pretty important to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An increase in more tax dollars; yes..I do agree with this. But, there is also the fact that it will increase everything about living here.

What I would like to see is more proposals in finding a balance. Seeing things in black and white will not get anyone anywhere. It simply promotes angst.

Not every homeless person is going to shit on a sidewalk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really?? Come on. To use the term "overtake" is rather exagerrated. If anyone is "overtaking" the city it would be the techies from the bay area. And they truly fuck everything up. </TEXT>
