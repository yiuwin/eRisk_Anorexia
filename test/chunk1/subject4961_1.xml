	<TEXT> Thank you! Very very helpful, I really appreciate these sorts of comments. For the drop system, I was thinking that a priests sb chance is multiplied by the amount they heal other players. Your point about making pots stackable, I totally agree with, and that is something that will definatly be put in the game. I can not garauntee that hackers won't exist, because when I 'hacker proof' it, they will find another loop hole, just like any game, though I will definatly be able to keep a firm grip on hackers. I totally go along with customisable skins, I will be making it as customisable as possible. As far as making money, I won't be putting any in-game things for cash, maybe your 9th char slot will be for money, but I intend to keep it so you can only earn items, and bling etc, as I don't want it to take away the achievement of when you actaully earn your stuff. Inventory slots based on your star rank is also a very good idea. All your idea's are very constructive and helpful, so thank you very much. 
I do ask that you post any further comments into my subreddit called 'RotMG Project' Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, so I want to make a game similar to RotMG, but something that fixes everything that people want in the actual RotMG, I will be using Gamemaker and Node.js for the project. I am totally unimaginative and would appreciate any ideas you have towards the project, i.e spritesets, tilesets, bosses, general stuff. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will be using NodeJS for the server, which is really fast, so you shouldn't have any problems with lag. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the game won't be released for while yet, but eventually it will be up. It will probably be on Game Jolt for a while, and then I might put it on a dedicated website. </TEXT>

Version: Alpha 0.1
Here are the bare basic mechanics sorted, Including the hp bar, mp bar, collisions, and movement, and some cool tiles. You will notice there is no player, its just a red square, I have a friend working on the sprites, so they will be added soon. </TEXT>
