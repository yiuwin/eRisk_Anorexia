	<TITLE> Announcement: On November 25th at 12PM PST AskHistorians will be hosting an AMA with Dr. Timothy Potts, director of the J. Paul Getty Museum </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-20 20:28:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If you're interested in art history, art preservation, exhibit design or any other aspect of museum curation, this is one you won't want to miss.

[Dr. Timothy Potts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Potts) has been director of the Getty Museum in Los Angeles since September of 2012.  He has previously served as director of the National Gallery of Victoria, the Kimbell Art Museum and the Fitzwilliam Museum, and boasts an academic resume that includes time at the universities of Melbourne, Sydney and Oxford.  He specializes in the art and history of the Ancient Near East, but has wide-ranging experience and expertise in numerous other fields as well.  We are extremely grateful to him for being willing to visit /r/AskHistorians and spend some time answering your questions.

The [Getty Museum](http://www.getty.edu/museum/) in Los Angeles, first established in 1954, is one of the top art museums in the United States.  Its enormous collection is dedicated primarily to Western art from the Middle Ages to the present, and over a million visitors a year pass through its doors.

Please be sure to be here for **12PM PST on November 25th** if you'd like to participate in this AMA.  The thread will be posted a few hours in advance by one of Dr. Potts' associates to give questions a chance to accumulate before his arrival, so if you have one you'd like to ask it would be best to check in early. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **[Last week!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1q3off/theory_thursday_academicprofessional_history/)**

**This week:**

Today's thread is for open discussion of:

- History in the academy
- Historiographical disputes, debates and rivalries
- Implications of historical theory both abstractly and in application
- Philosophy of history
- And so on

Regular participants in the Thursday threads should just keep doing what they've been doing; newcomers should take notice that this thread is meant for open discussion only of matters like those above, not just anything you like -- we'll have a thread on Friday for that, as usual. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've just now returned from the Cenotaph in the heart of downtown Ottawa, Canada's capital.  It's a remarkable monument, and the service there today was excellent.

But it makes me wonder: what sort of memorials are there where you live?  What do they look like?  When were they built?  Is there anything unusual about them?  Any interesting stories behind them?  Today seems like as good a pretext for talking about them as any!  Anyone choosing to reply should try to include at least one picture of the memorial in question so we can all get a sense of the thing. </TEXT>

**Today:**

The "Monday Mysteries" series will be focused on, well, mysteries -- historical matters that present us with problems of some sort, and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is. Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a (so far) unknown variable, like the sinking of the Lusitania; situations in which we only know that something did happen, but not necessarily how or why, like the deaths of Richard III's nephews in the Tower of London; situations in which something has become lost, or become found, or turned out never to have been at all -- like the art of Greek fire, or the Antikythera mechanism, or the historical Coriolanus, respectively.

**This week, let's take a look at some mysteries, oddities and the like from the wide world of art.**

I don't have time to make a full prompt here as I have to head down to the cenotaph, so, in brief, we're looking for:

- Important works of art (in any medium) with unknown authors.
- Scandals, arguments and other painful moments from throughout the history of art.
- Artistic works that have vanished in some fashion.
- Artistic works that saw something unusual happen during the course of their production.
- Artistic works that may have (or that have at least been accused of having) secret messages, codes or meanings within them.
- Anything in this vein, really, so long as it seems like it's applicable.

Moderation, as usual, will be light -- but you're still expected to post politely and in good faith!

**Next week on Monday Mysteries: We'll be putting out the traffic cones as we examine the great accidents (and "accidents") of history.** </TEXT>

We're trying something new in /r/AskHistorians.

Readers here tend to like the open discussion threads and questions that allow a multitude of possible answers from people of all sorts of backgrounds and levels of expertise.  The [most popular thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dv49y/tt_youre_at_a_party_the_people_around_you_find/) in this subreddit's history, for example, was about questions you dread being asked at parties -- over 2000 comments, and most of them were very interesting!

So, we do want to make questions like this a more regular feature, but we also don't want to make them TOO common -- /r/AskHistorians is, and will remain, a subreddit dedicated to educated experts answering specific user-submitted questions.  General discussion is good, but it isn't the primary point of the place.

With this in mind, from time to time, one of the moderators will post an open-ended question of this sort.  It will be distinguished by the "Feature" flair to set it off from regular submissions, and the same relaxed moderation rules that prevail in the daily project posts will apply.  We expect that anyone who wishes to contribute will do so politely and in good faith, but there is far more scope for speculation and general chat than there would be in a usual thread.  

We hope to experiment with this a bit over the next few weeks to see how it works.  Please let us know [via the mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians) if you have any questions, comments or concerns about this new endeavour!

=-=-=-=-=-=

**Today's question** is a pretty straightforward one, but with many different possible types of answers.

What have you found in your research and reading that has most powerfully reminded you that the people of the past were, well... people?  It's often easy to forget this, especially the farther back one goes -- there are some ancient cultures about which we know so little that picturing their day-to-day life or the contours of their feelings and relationships is all but impossible.  Even those about which we know comparatively more may still seem alien and peculiar to us.

And yet... these moments of recognition can happen.  What have you discovered in this direction?  A two-thousand-year-old birthday card?  A flower given to a fiancee in the 1700s and then preserved in the pages of a book?  Lewd graffiti in a language we can't properly understand?  Ancient doodling in the margins of a still-more-ancient manuscript?  The ring of someone's cocoa mug preserved on a document that hasn't seen the light of day in centuries?

There are so many possibilities, and, where the previous two threads asked specifically for things that were unusually moving or hilarious, this thread provides a bit more scope for things that could be rather more mundane than not.  We're still very interested in hearing about them, though, so let's get started!

**Next time:** To expand on a recent post in the last Friday thread, we'll be taking a look at **the individual years that you find most interesting**. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **[Last week!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1plywb/theory_thursday_professionalacademic_history/)**

**This week:**

Today's thread is for open discussion of:

- History in the academy
- Historiographical disputes, debates and rivalries
- Implications of historical theory both abstractly and in application
- Philosophy of history
- And so on

Regular participants in the Thursday threads should just keep doing what they've been doing; newcomers should take notice that this thread is meant for open discussion only of matters like those above, not just anything you like -- we'll have a thread on Friday for that, as usual. </TEXT>

- [The Politics of Commemoration](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hpb4j/open_discussion_the_politics_of_commemoration/)

**Today:**

Howard Zinn, in [a 2007 letter](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/books/review/Letters-t-1.html?_r=0) to the *New York Times* defending his popular *A People's History of the United States*, offered the following in description of that text's intent:

 I want young people to understand that ours is a beautiful country, but it has been taken over by men who have no respect for human rights or constitutional liberties. Our people are basically decent and caring, and our highest ideals are expressed in the Declaration of Independence, which says that all of us have an equal right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The history of our country, I point out in my book, is a striving, against corporate robber barons and war makers, to make those ideals a reality  and all of us, of whatever age, can find immense satisfaction in becoming part of that. 

However good or bad these intentions may be, they are intentions -- and they are *not* simply "I wanted to offer an overview of American history from the colonial era to the present."  The book does not do that, its author did not want it to do that, and any engagement with the book must necessarily take this into account.

To engage in polemic is, under its strictest definition, to inveigh against something -- to identify some sort of problem or error or otherwise undesirable state of affairs and then to set oneself against it in speech or prose.  For our purposes today, discussing historiography, we might adopt a somewhat more open definition: that of "writing history with intent."

There are a number of questions to pose at the start, and we seek submissions and discussion today on the matters surrounding them:

- Is an "activist historiography" possible, or -- if possible -- desirable?

- What is the relationship between historiography and propaganda?

- What is the value of works, such as Zinn's, which we might loosely describe as being not simply "history" but rather "history and..."?

- If we accept that such works have value, how does the reader go about extracting the history from the editorial?  Or is any such extraction possible or necessary?

- What are the challenges in keeping one's political, economic, religious or other views out of one's writing about history?  Or should they be so kept out?

Submissions on more general topics are also welcome:

- What are some works of history that you feel have been marked by this polemic or editorial quality?  What are the consequences of this?

- Which historians (living or dead) have walked this line with aplomb?  Or fallen over the edge?

**All are welcome to participate!  Moderation will be light, but please ensure that your posts are in-depth, charitable, friendly, and conducted with the same spirit of respect and helpfulness that we've come to regularly expect in /r/AskHistorians.** </TEXT>

**Today:**

The "Monday Mysteries" series will be focused on, well, mysteries -- historical matters that present us with problems of some sort, and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is. Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a (so far) unknown variable, like the sinking of the Lusitania; situations in which we only know that something did happen, but not necessarily how or why, like the deaths of Richard III's nephews in the Tower of London; situations in which something has become lost, or become found, or turned out never to have been at all -- like the art of Greek fire, or the Antikythera mechanism, or the historical Coriolanus, respectively.

**This week, I'd like to hear about those new historical or historiographical ideas that are making waves in your respective fields.**

Not every new idea ends up taking off right away -- or at all.  Novel and intriguing though it may be, sometimes the necessary support for it just doesn't exist at first; sometimes methodological problems seem to scupper it; and sometimes, as I'm sure we've all seen, even good ideas find themselves running up against something far more entrenched and established.

What are the new ideas, new approaches, or new understandings in your field that deserve our attention in spite of perhaps not yet being widely accepted?  I'm looking for:

- New historiography that unsettles or revises the old -- but soundly.

- New revelations about historical events or figures that have not yet been widely accepted, but which you nevertheless believe have merit.

- Anything new and controversial at all, really, so long as you're willing to make the case for it.

Moderation, as usual, will be light -- but you're still expected to post politely and in good faith!

**Next week on Monday Mysteries: We'll be pulling out all the stops for a general look at the mysterious world of art!** </TEXT>

**Today:**

The "Monday Mysteries" series will be focused on, well, mysteries -- historical matters that present us with problems of some sort, and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is. Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a (so far) unknown variable, like the sinking of the Lusitania; situations in which we only know that something did happen, but not necessarily how or why, like the deaths of Richard III's nephews in the Tower of London; situations in which something has become lost, or become found, or turned out never to have been at all -- like the art of Greek fire, or the Antikythera mechanism, or the historical Coriolanus, respectively.

**This week, we'll be taking a look at unusual or unexpected meetings between noteworthy historical figures.**

I place this stipulation of unusualness or unexpectedness upon today's thread because it would be very easy to run towards the mundane.  That President Kennedy might have met Vice-President Johnson to discuss a budgetary matter is not exactly the kind of thing we're looking for here, as the two might reasonably be expected to meet at any time and the matter being discussed was a perennial one.  However!  If you have a story about the same two men chancing to meet long before either's rise to prominence, or meeting during their administrative tenure but to engage in an arm-wrestling contest -- those would be just fine.

So, we're after:

- Meetings and encounters between two famous people while one or both of them had yet to become famous; e.g. a young Barack Obama gets his catcher's mitt signed by Richard Feynman.

- Meetings between people who might reasonably have been expected to meet anyway, but for an unusual or unexpected purpose; e.g. the above example of the arm-wrestling.

- Incidents in which noteworthy historical figures have been confronted by or had memorable encounters with people very much less famous or "important;" e.g. a king being scolded by a commoner for forgetting his duty.

- Encounters, generally, that would seemingly just have no business happening at all -- but which did; e.g. chance encounter between Jefferson Davis and Shaka Zulu (I am almost certain this didn't happen).

Moderation, as usual, will be light -- but you're still expected to post politely and in good faith!

**Next week on Monday Mysteries: Pull out your historiographic knives, because we're going to get into the cutting-edge theories in your field that may not yet be fully accepted!** </TEXT>

- [What in your study of history have you found especially moving or touching?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1p22pc/what_in_your_study_of_history_have_you_found/)

We're trying something new in /r/AskHistorians.

Readers here tend to like the open discussion threads and questions that allow a multitude of possible answers from people of all sorts of backgrounds and levels of expertise.  The [most popular thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dv49y/tt_youre_at_a_party_the_people_around_you_find/) in this subreddit's history, for example, was about questions you dread being asked at parties -- over 2000 comments, and most of them were very interesting!

So, we do want to make questions like this a more regular feature, but we also don't want to make them TOO common -- /r/AskHistorians is, and will remain, a subreddit dedicated to educated experts answering specific user-submitted questions.  General discussion is good, but it isn't the primary point of the place.

With this in mind, from time to time, one of the moderators will post an open-ended question of this sort.  It will be distinguished by the "Feature" flair to set it off from regular submissions, and the same relaxed moderation rules that prevail in the daily project posts will apply.  We expect that anyone who wishes to contribute will do so politely and in good faith, but there is far more scope for speculation and general chat than there would be in a usual thread.  

We hope to experiment with this a bit over the next few weeks to see how it works.  Please let us know [via the mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians) if you have any questions, comments or concerns about this new endeavour!

=-=-=-=

The first installment in this new series of floating features was a great success, but it was also often very downbeat!  Let's try taking a look at the other side of the coin: what sort of things have you discovered in your research that have filled you delight or good humour?  

To be clear, when I ask for something that has made you smile or laugh, I'm looking for things that have done so in a happy way, not a vindictive one; if you're laughing because someone was just too stupid to be believed, or something like that, today's thread isn't the place to talk about it.  That's not to say we won't ever have one, but we're trying to keep it light today.

So, what have you found?  Something unexpectedly funny?  A person who had an amusing life or who participated in an hilarious or heart-warming incident?  An act of kindness or charity or even tomfoolery?  An event that colloquially restored your faith in humanity?  Let's hear about them!

**Next time:** I'm not sure *when* it will go up precisely, but I intend to ask about which single year you find the most full or interesting on an historical level.  Keep checking back! </TEXT>

Today's thread is for open discussion of:

- History in the academy
- Historiographical disputes, debates and rivalries
- Implications of historical theory both abstractly and in application
- Philosophy of history
- And so on

Regular participants in the Thursday threads should just keep doing what they've been doing; newcomers should take notice that this thread is meant for open discussion only of matters like those above, not just anything you like -- we'll have a thread on Friday for that, as usual. </TEXT>

Often, when we study matters of history, we will come across stories that prove very significant to us on an emotional level.  The distance and rigor of the scholar often prevent us from giving in to those feelings too heavily, but it's impossible to simply shunt them to the side forever.

What sort of things have you encountered in your study of history that have moved or touched you in some fashion?  What moments of great sadness or beauty?  Of tragedy or triumph?  What have you seen that has really made you *feel*?  It could be a person, an event, the collapse or victory of an idea -- anything you like.  Please try to explain why it touched you so when responding.

Let's give this a try. </TEXT>

Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a (so far) unknown variable, like the sinking of the Lusitania; situations in which we only know that something did happen, but not necessarily how or why, like the deaths of Richard III's nephews in the Tower of London; situations in which something has become lost, or become found, or turned out never to have been at all -- like the art of Greek fire, or the Antikythera mechanism, or the historical Coriolanus, respectively.

**This week, we're looking for posts for notably singular artifacts, people, events or things from throughout history.**

Ever since reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nzepw/tuesday_trivia_arresting_artifacts/ccnjnpt) delightful little comment by /u/Tiako, I've found myself wondering about the world of things that seem isolated in history -- of things that, so far as we can tell, have never been echoed or repeated.  In this case it's the oddity of a piece of craft work from a large, nearby mercantile culture showing up in ancient Rome in one place and one place only -- but what about other possibilities?

In this thread we're after:

- Similarly isolated artifacts; is there a single Mongolian quilt that somehow made its way to Madagascar?  A lonely mosaic constructed in ancient Antium that's the only one we know of to depict someone catching a fly ball?  An important cultural artifact from one culture that now resides in the capital of another?  Let's hear about them.

- Singular or isolated events; is there a one-and-only time that five reigning kings have been in the same room together?  The only war ever declared, fought, and won in a single day?  We can talk about them, too.

- People with singular claims or statuses; is there a woman who shook the hand of twelve successive presidents?  A man who is the only one to have ever danced the Charleston non-stop for five hours during the Siege of Khe Sanh?  The first known albino?  The last known Etruscan?  Trot them out.

Moderation, as usual, will be light -- but you're still expected to post politely and in good faith!

**This week:**

Today's thread is for open discussion of:

- History in the academy
- Historiographical disputes, debates and rivalries
- Implications of historical theory both abstractly and in application
- Philosophy of history
- And so on

**Today:**

The "Monday Mysteries" series will be focused on, well, mysteries -- historical matters that present us with problems of some sort, and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is. Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a (so far) unknown variable, like the sinking of the Lusitania; situations in which we only know that something did happen, but not necessarily how or why, like the deaths of Richard III's nephews in the Tower of London; situations in which something has become lost, or become found, or turned out never to have been at all -- like the art of Greek fire, or the Antikythera mechanism, or the historical Coriolanus, respectively.

**This week, we want to hear about misunderstandings of the past that people** ***in*** **the past have had.**

This is a straightforward enough concept, though somewhat grammatically torturous to describe.  What did people in bygone times and places think about their own history that we now have good reason to suspect is false?  How did we make this discovery, and what did the historiographic transition look like once it became more widely known?

Moderation will be light, as usual, but please offer in-depth, interesting comments that are produced in good faith.

**Next week on Monday Mysteries: Taking inspiration from a [remarkable comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nzepw/tuesday_trivia_arresting_artifacts/ccnjnpt) by /u/Tiako in a recent thread, we'll be talking about** ***historical one-ofs*** **-- that is, objects, events, people or ideas that turned up exactly once, perhaps very mysteriously, and then did not recur again.** </TEXT>

**This week:**

You know the drill: this is the thread for all your history-related outpourings that are not necessarily questions. Minor questions that you feel don't need or merit their own threads are welcome too. Discovered a great new book, documentary, article or blog? Has your PhD application been successful? Have you made an archaeological discovery in your back yard? Tell us all about it.

As usual, moderation in this thread will be relatively non-existent -- jokes, anecdotes and light-hearted banter are welcome. </TEXT>

**Today:**

The "Monday Mysteries" series will be focused on, well, mysteries -- historical matters that present us with problems of some sort, and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is. Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a (so far) unknown variable, like the sinking of the Lusitania; situations in which we only know that something did happen, but not necessarily how or why, like the deaths of Richard III's nephews in the Tower of London; situations in which something has become lost, or become found, or turned out never to have been at all -- like the art of Greek fire, or the Antikythera mechanism, or the historical Coriolanus, respectively.

**This week we'll be taking a look at mysterious or unusual groups throughout history, whether they be clubs, cults, secret societies, or something else entirely.**

- Have there been any real "secret cults" throughout history?  Around what were they formed?  What did their initiates do?

- What about secret societies?  What were their aims?  Who were their members?

- Groups that were the real "power(s) behind the throne"?

- Secret groups that have had unexpectedly non-sinister purposes?

- Anything else that seems like it would fit.

Moderation will be light, as usual, but please offer in-depth, interesting comments that are produced in good faith.

**Next week on Monday Mysteries: In a bit of a departure from our usual material, we're going to be taking a look at some** ***historical historical misconceptions (sic)*** **-- that is, false ideas and beliefs that people in the past have had about their own past.  It sounds a bit complicated, but it will be pretty straightforward once we get to it!** </TEXT>
