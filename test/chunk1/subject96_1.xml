	<TEXT> trying to belittle them by calling them retarded or ignorant doesn't come across well

I was literally just saying you're ignorant because you were blatantly fucking wrong. But you go on to call me a Nazi, because you're a lefty moron.

you cant point towards a single thing and say that is the cause

Yes, you literally can. The Hart-Celler Act is the primary cause of America's demographic shift. 

This did not really change the amount of immigration in itself, just from where in the world people were allowed to migrate from

Correct.

(and since it heavily restricted immigration people started entering illegal)

Did you even read the article I linked?

you are a racist that want the US to be more "white"

I rarely say this unironically, but kill yourself. Throw yourself off a fucking bridge or something. I have posted a huge number of comments in this thread responding to brain-dead fuckwits like yourself politely responding and pointing out that I'm actually not racist, for a very large number of reasons. I'm done with that. If "ur racist" is your only fucking comeback, kill yourself kiddo.

REAL Americans fought people like you in WW2,

Hey retard, when was Hart-Celler passed? Americans who fought in WW2 had the same beliefs I did regarding immigration. But durr hurr I'm a Nazi now because I don't believe in open borders.

You wouldn't have a problem with it if it was from countries you deemed as "white"

Stop projecting and read my other comments in this thread, retard. I'm done typing out 1000 fucking words and explaining my beliefs politely while you braindead shitheads call me racist.  </TEXT>

I have a feeling you actually have no concept of what the government does for the American people. Or, for that matter, anything your state and local county governments do.

If you honestly think Congress could function without legislative assistants, and "most bills shouldn't be more than a page long", you are functionally retarded and should probably be put down. Full stop.

	<TEXT> less politics and more getting shit done

That's literally what I said in my comment. 

The sheer fact that your job even exists is part of the problem.

This may be the most pants-on-head retarded thing I have ever heard. Firstly, legislative assistants have always been a thing, from the very beginning of the Republic. The idealized past that you are dreaming of, where legislative aides weren't a thing, never existed. Even the kings of old had people who drafted their bills.

You do get that, right? Politicians don't write bills. Truth is politicians do very, very little. They tell us an idea for a bill, we draft it up in Legalese, checking for legality and precedents and older bills. That's our job. It's an invaluable job, because we make sure laws are written properly so we don't end up with shitty interpretations.

If not for aides (and there are several of us in each office), what would happen? Politicians would pore over every one of the dozens of bills proposed every day, while writing their own, explaining the laws to their constuents and negotiating bills with other legislators?

And most of us are specialized in a particular branch of law. We're not interns, we are experts in a given area. Politicians rely on our knowledge and experience.

Who would answer the phones, prepare itineraries, meet with groups, and communicate with other offices? God damn sure the politicians can't do all that while meeting with constituents and doing press conferences.

Without aides, what would happen to the small business owner newly elected as a Representative? He would flail about, not understanding the Legalese he now has to read. Become overwhelmed and soon leave office, disgruntled, because nobody was there to help him.

The fact that you wrote this comment proves that you have *no fucking idea* how the government works. Shit, without legislative aides Donald Trump would have no fucking idea what to do - do you think he writes bills and executive orders himself? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are differing views, but I think everyone can agree that intent is required for one to be evil.

Adolf Hitler gassing Jews was evil. A baby accidentally pressing a "gas Jews" button is not, because Hitler had intent and the baby did not.

The same applies to hitting someone with a car, shooting someone, etc. You can argue that someone is reckless or stupid, but not evil, for accidentally killing someone. If they *intend* to do it, that's a different story.

Not a single Democrat *intends* to create a totalitarian, managerial state. Not a single Democrat intends to take away our liberties, disarm us, weaken the fundamental structure of society, make us unsafe, let criminals off the hook, etc. Those are merely the *unintended* consequences of their actions.

I think that Democrats are foolhardy, impetuous, and blatantly wrong on most issues of the day. I don't think they are evil. 

Look, I work as a legislative aide. I can tell you firsthand that Democrats want to fix the problems facing us. They just have the wrong ideas on how to do it. A big part of the problem is that people "on the ground" have no idea how the government works, have never met politicians or seen the workings of our government. If they did, they wouldn't say the other side is evil. They have no concept of real politics, just the flashy and confrontational stuff that the media feeds them. Nobody in our government is evil. We're all working together to fix the problems we have, and the Democrats happen to be wrong most of the time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correlation does not imply causation

You'd have to be absolutely retarded, or completely ignorant of the Hart-Celler Act, to think that.

Before the Hart-Celler Act, there were immigration restrictions based on national origin. A certain number of immigrants were allowed from each region of the world. These national quotas were used to ensure that the demographics of the USA remained roughly at the same proportions.

 The Hart-Celler Act completely eliminated these national quotas and thus accepted immigration on a "colorblind" basis.

Despite the assurances of the eponymous Sen. Hart and Rep. Celler, the USA quickly became considerably less white.

The Hart-Celler Act actually contributed directly to illegal immigration, too. [Here is a great article about it, from a very left-wing sociologist.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/25/how-a-1965-immigration-reform-created-illegal-immigration/?utm_term=.4eaa88bad87c)

I don't think there has ever been a clearer causation. </TEXT>

Badass believer in human rights

The human right to get gummint handouts is more important to you than the right to free speech, the right to not be thrown in a gulag, or the right of Arab women to not be attacked with acid for trying to get an education.

My strength is in the service of others

Says the person who never volunteers or donates to charity. Actually, you want other people to serve the government. You do nothing except vote liberal.

There is nothing more fierce than formidable, unconditional love.

Unless you're a fucking evil Nazi bigot, or white, or straight, or cis, or male. In that case, fuck you. Asshole.

There is not a thing more courageous than compassion.

Cops, soldiers, firefighters, so on and so forth are fare more courageous than people standing around waving "refugees welcome" signs.

Equality, empathy, goodness, and love

	<TEXT> abolished profit and got rid of private property

This is really simple: That's false. People still owned private property in Nazi Germany. Companies still profited in Nazi Germany. Do you think the German economic miracle occurred under socialism?

Every speech he gave referred to the 1% and the need to take away their property to be run by the state for the people.

Where are you getting this from? It's just untrue. He never wanted to seize the means of production. And he never did so.

LOL Really? Oh God this was hard:

Yeah, nowhere in that speech did he say that the wealthy "have to be removed to usher in the perfect socialist state", which is a direct quote from you. You are, by far, the most historically ignorant, economically retarded, and politically stupid person I've had the displeasure of meeting - and this is Reddit, so that's saying something.

	<TEXT> Why does this matter? In the 30s in was the Irish and Italians, now that the immigrants are black and asian there's an issue?

Most immigrants are neither black nor Asian, they're Latin American, so there's that. Secondly, as I've said *many times* in this thread, I have no problem with the race of immigrants. I have a problem with a few things.

Firstly, they are clustered in such a way that there is essentially a zone beyond the border with Mexico that is an extension of Mexico. Within that zone, Mexican culture and Spanish language is the norm, supplanting the culture, language and traditions of the American people who lived there before them. We need to assimilate them into our culture, and I think that's a reasonable expectation.

Secondly, that zone grows larger every year. It's an expanding frontier of Mexican culture, whereas the Irish and Italian were scattered throughout America (and assimilated into Anglo-American culture while keeping some of their own quirks).

I hate calling people racist, but dude, really?

You clearly don't "hate calling people racist" if you bring it out like that.

Edit: Jesus Christ dude you're like the definition of a racist. Wow.

racist, n: a person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or who believes that a particular race is superior to another.

yeah, if you'd actually read my comments you'd know that isn't the case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP was saying "this is business as usual", and comparing it to the 1800s.

I was pointing out that this is not at all like the 1800s, because immigration then was almost entirely white.

I was not making a value judgment. I was making a factual statement. Immigration prior to 1965 did not disrupt or majorly change the demographic balance of the USA. Immigration since then has. 

Those are factual statements. 

Whether or not non-white and white people can both assimilate is completely irrelevant. I'm sure they can. The fact is, however, that many immigrants *are not assimilating*. Not that they can't - but that they are not. And in many cases, we are not making a serious effort to assimilate them.

If this trend continues, our national polarization will continue. National cohesion will weaken. Obama spoke of the need to overcome the "two nations" mindset of "red and blue states". I doubt he foresaw that America would soon be made up not of one nation, but of multiple nations, defined ethnically, religiously or culturally, who in many cases are against one another.

If I wanted an all-white ethnostate, I would say it. I am not shy from making controversial statements and upsetting people. Your insinuations that I am a racist are frankly false. I don't care about race. I care about national unity, and mass immigration without assimilation is a recipe for disaster.

Just look at Texas for an example - settlers from America colonized Texas, which was part of Mexico. They supplanted the local culture and language and religion with their own, then decided they didn't like the government and rebelled to form their own country.

I'm not saying we're going to be seeing a Free State of Aztlan any time soon (though there are people who want that), but we are opening ourselves up to a serious problem if we don't make great efforts to assimilate immigrants and include them in our nation. We're already severely divided. In my opinion, we will either take drastic actions for national unity, peacefully separate, or soon see a second civil war.

That's all I'm saying. You can feel free to screech "RACIST" all you want, I'm done commenting here because it's completely unproductive and I'm tired of being insulted.  </TEXT>

The only problems Africans actually faced in Rhodesia were restrictions on voting, which were in the process of being lifted before the communists took over. 

(And keep in mind that for all intents and purposes *they can't vote at all today*.)

Which would you rather face: having restrictions on voting, *or* not being able to vote *and* facing 79.6 billion percent inflation? There's really no reasonable measure by which Rhodesia *wasn't* better for everyone. </TEXT>

(Probably about 50% of all comments in this given thread, actually.) And unlike you (and many of the other goons in this thread), I haven't resorted to baseless insults to make my point.

The most ironic part, I think, is that you didn't actually refute or rebut *anything* I said. You just likened me to a creationist. You didn't even make the attempt - you just used slurs to try and insult me. 

If you want to talk about "hindering actual intelligent discussion", perhaps look over your comment before smugly pressing "save". Let me know if you're interested in actual, productive, respectful conversation. You're capable of it, I'm sure.

Edit: Actually, you might not be. Your first comment to me literally said "wow just wow UR A RACIST", so maybe you're just completely incapable of reasonable discussion.

	<TEXT> The issue is that you have a strict definition of what real america is, which is likely white suburban picket fence 2 kids and a stay at home wife type deal right?

Huh? I never said anything of the sort. Here you are, just... assuming things. Baselessly.

 The America I know and love is dozens of different cultures existing, some of them melting together, some of them keeping their original flavor, and most are somewhere in between. Not everyone is going to fully assimilate into American culture, because there is no strict American culture anymore, not like there was 60 years ago.

But that's the problem, isn't it? We used to have a melting pot, where everyone assimilated into American culture while keeping some facets of their own. What we have now is a salad bowl, where cultures stay separate, Mexicans and Arabs and whites have their own gangs and their own ethnic enclaves, and it's "racist" to try and assimilate minorities. 

This is one of the biggest things destroying national cohesion and driving political polarization. This is one of the biggest things putting us on the path to a second civil war. A nation cannot survive without a shared national culture.

Anyways, I just connected the dots and realized your a white supremacist posting in /r/altright and /r/rhodesia, so you probably want to see me deported or wiped off the face of the earth. 

By "connected the dots" you mean "trawled through my post history for anything damaging", right? And by "white supremacist" you mean... Actually, I don't know what you mean, because you just used it as a slur without actually clarifying what you mean.

I don't know your ethnicity, so I don't want to make assumptions (I don't assign people motives and ethnicities and beliefs based on assumptions, unlike you), but I support a black homeland for African-Americans, just as Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, and Louis Farrakhan did. I support ceding land back to Native Americans. I'm certainly not a white supremacist. I think that every ethnicity has strengths and weaknesses of its own.

Don't come here trying to act reasonable or 'just posting facts bro!' when you clearly have an ulterior motive.

For starters, I am acting reasonable. You (and many others!) have attacked and insulted me, and I don't think I've insulted anyone in return. Secondly, *I am posting facts*. Rather than trying to disprove my logic, or disprove my facts, you're just saying I'm a racist. That's not an argument, and I think you know that. 

I don't respond to race-baiting insults, so let me know if you're interested in an actual substantive discussion. I'm sure you're capable of it, I just hope you rise to the occasion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the reasonable discourse, friendo.

Wilson was a racist, sure, but not to an extent beyond that of the normal person. Also, Wilson was the father of the League of Nations (in turn the granddaddy of the UN); he was the founder of American internationalism - it was mostly Republicans like Bob Taft and John Bricker who were isolationist. 

There definitely are differences between the parties today (I would argue that the black vote going from Republican from 1865-1932, to a swing vote from 32-65, to a solidly Democratic vote since then, is the biggest difference) but the whole "the parties flipped" meme is just that: a meme. It oversimplifies history and it's just tiring to see.

Frankly, other than the racism, Woodrow Wilson and Hillary Clinton have very similar political beliefs. The parties just didn't change that much. </TEXT>

Either you don't understand my point, or you're intentionally ignoring it. My point was that the majority of non-immigrant Americans almost certainly supported Trump. You also completely ignored my point about the majority of Americans opposing more immigration.



Trump + Johnson + McMullin + Castle still isn't a majority.

You're right - add them together and you get a total of 49.89%. The vote total must have changed since last I checked, my apologies. However, I'm sure that various third parties (Veterans Party, American Solidarity Party, American Independent Party, American Party, etc etc) make up at least 0.11% of the vote. Regardless, the source I posted clearly showed a majority disagreeing with increased immigration, and many people wanting to decrease it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The republican party is unrecognizable to what it was a century ago and so is the democratic.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but this is very much overhyped. Democrat Woodrow Wilson (president 105 years ago) believed in progressive government regulation, progressive taxation, and an internationalist foreign policy - similar to the Democratic Party's ideals today. Republican William Taft (president 108 years ago) sought lower tariffs, and supported business interests.

The two parties were not "unrecognizable". They were perfectly recognizable. There were minor aberrations, like Theodore Roosevelt and La Follette as progressive Republicans, but the truth was that, from 1896 onward, the Democratic Party was liberal and the Republican Party was conservative. Each party, though, had *wings*, or factions, that were conservative and liberal, respectively. 

Anyways, this has become a history lesson, but the point is that since 1896 the parties have been roughly coherent, with a few minor aberrations. Your claim that the parties were "unrecognizable" is blatantly false. However, importing millions of people from countries with very different political values will indubitably change the political landscape here. I'm no fan of the Democratic Party, but I'd take them over the *Partido Revolucionario Institucional* any day. And the *Partido Accin Nacional*, while the conservative party in Mexico, supports government intervention to a far greater extent than the Republican Party, so certainly even Mexican conservatives are different than ours. 

Yes, immigration will greatly change the political landscape. It always has. I'm not saying the parties will stay static, but we should probably reduce non-organic ideological drift to the minimum, you know? </TEXT>

I think you're missing a very important distinction here. The Scandinavians *chose* to convert to Christianity. Christians did not move into Scandinavia, outbreed the pagans, and then become a majority who had control over Scandinavia - *the Scandinavians converted of their own free will*. This is not comparable to foreigners replacing our traditions with their own.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I feel like Sun and Moon teased a new Kanto adventure very heavily. 

Firstly, with the appearance of Professor Oak, Red, and Blue. Introducing these characters into the series again (especially Red and Blue) essentially confirms that they'll be in more games - there's no way they would tease these characters just for minor roles in one game.

More importantly, Lillie leaves for Kanto at the end of the game. I think that her leaving for Kanto specifically, combined with the Kanto characters showing up, is no coincidence, and that she will be in the new Kanto game. Her reason for leaving is apparently to find Bill, and help heal her mother - I don't think that's a thread that will remain unresolved. (Also, Hau didn't get to say goodbye to her. I have a feeling he'll be in the game too, possibly trying to find her.)

There are also some minor things to support this, like how the player character is from Kanto, all the Alolan forms were of Gen 1 Pokemon, and the Ash-Greninja you get in the special demo version.

I don't think the next game will be a RBY remake (unless they want to really mess with the timeline, even more than Anabel's appearance did). It'll be a sequel set in Kanto, RBY2 in a way. Since the release of the Gen VII games coincided with the 20 year anniversary, it seems fitting to me.

-Economic nationalism

-Anti-corruption

These are, to a tee, the stances of the Reform Party, though Trump may be more focused on cutting taxes than balancing the budget.

While Trump has taken a socially conservative stance on some issues, he's an open supporter of the LGBT community and was pro-choice for much of his life, leaving many to conclude these stances are only to appease the evangelical voters. The Reform Party does not take stances on social issues, instead urging its candidates to vote their conscience. 

He also has the same business background as the Reform Party's famous candidate, Ross Perot, and he is also a populist.

Trump's a businessman. Was his candidacy just a hostile takeover of GOP by Reform Party elements?
