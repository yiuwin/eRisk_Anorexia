	<TEXT> I'm not sure, I'm pretty new to gardening. I usually water after I get back from work as it's still light out. I'm not a morning person. I'm getting a few bugs, but the vegetables seem to be doing ok. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, 

Just wanted to tell you that you're not alone. I was raised a Muslim by a very religious family. I went through the same struggles you may be going though. Trying to make sense of it, wondering why I was gay. What my family would think if they found out. 

It's taken a long time, but I'm now 31, i have a partner, we live together, and my mum loves her. So does my sister and my brother. My father has never met her. My aunt and uncle refuse to acknowledge her. So prepare for some people to really hate it. I don't think you can keep it from them forever. However, some people will surprise you. They'll show you that they love you for you, and always will. 

Start seeking out a support network, even if it's online. People you can talk to about things when they get hard. I can PM you my email address if you like.

Whatever you do, don't hate yourself. You're not a terrible person, and you're not a sinner. People may want you to believe that you are, or that being gay is to "get past the test god has given you", but live your life for yourself, and you'll do ok. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, I have lots and lots of boxes of clothes, (t shirts, jeans) all in relatively good condition and good brands. Where's the best place to donate to? I also have some PS3 games, random household things and books.

Everything is in good condition, just been in storage and I just don't fit these clothes anymore (too many burgers). I don't want it to just go to landfill, and I don't want it to go to some anti gay/anti refugee type group, unless I have no other choice. 

I had a garage sale already, this is what's leftover. Just want to clear out my garage so I can put something in there, like a pool table, or like, a car.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She's played lots of wii games, and also fantasy games. So I might look into that genre. She sometimes likes to backseat drive when I play the witcher, but walks out of the room if it gets too violent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone suggested Goat Simulator and I thought that was a joke, until I googled it. So I watched the trailer, and one of the first scenes is the goat being dragged under a car, so I may give that one a miss. 

I'll check out civilization though! Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What is a great video game for adults that doesn't have shooting, death and isn't a car or sports game? (x-post AskReddit) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I also posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5cd1t3/what_is_a_great_video_game_for_adults_that_doesnt/)

Basically my partner has PTSD and I'd like to buy games that don't bring on flashbacks (too much visual death, and people being run over by cars). Also trying to avoid guns if possible.

I own a PS4, but I'm happy to buy another console, or get a gaming PC if needed. Willing to spend whatever really. I want to get lots of games for a huge christmas gift. People have suggested Portal which I  have bought. I got simcity too.

Any suggestions would be great, thanks!

Edit: Everyone in this community has been amazing with suggestions. Thank you all so much. It looks like I'll need to invest in a gaming PC and a steam account. So can anyone suggest where I should start for that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep we've had these discussions and she's pointed out rings to me when we walk past shops, but they're always varied. We've both expressed that we are in this for the long run. Her family all know I'm head over heels for her, and I want to marry her.

We've lived together for a year, so we have had convos about marriage. Technically, it's still not legal here, so I'm not sure if she wants to wait for that.

I could just ask her everything but I would like to keep an element of surprise to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nearly 2 years. I think something more traditional. Diamonds is what's done I guess, maybe even something antique. I want to get something unique. Her hands are small, so I don't need to get something massive. The ring I reckon I can figure out by shopping around, I just want to really sweep her off her feet with the proposal. </TEXT>
