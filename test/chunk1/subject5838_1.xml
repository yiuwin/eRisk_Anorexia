	<TEXT> Very well!  They are dishwasher safe (top shelf), though I would recommend hand washing them.  On every order I've had, I include that it's guaranteed 100% and if anything should happen, I'd be happy to replace.  I haven't had any replacements aside from 1 broken wine glass last Christmas, which since then I've packaged much, much better. :-)

Edit: Shown are scotch glasses, but I'm going to be listing ninja shot glasses later this week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While some of these made me chuckle, there's a HUGE market for stamped metal jewelry and personalized stuff.  I see sellers every other day on the front page for either stamped gardening spoons (okay, 'tis the season), or around mother's day/christmas with personalized stamped children's names or family names or pet collars--just a suggestion to have this be a teeny part of your potential empire.  Best of luck to you! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who has started up a number of etsy shops, I know what it's like to try to get that initial "bump" to get things going.  If anyone on here would like to trade [from this shop](http://www.ragepaints.etsy.com) or [this shop](http://www.coloradosports.etsy.com), I would be happy to walk you through it.  Like I said, willing to trade decals and vinyl for whatever, usually I send trades to my sisters who live a few states away as little gifts to pop up in the mail. :-)

Custom requests also welcome, the standard size I do is 3x4" for $5. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do trades to build sales/feedback and have future customers trust your shop.  Lowering your prices is last on the list - do search ads, join teams, and promote - there are so many factors contributing to the number of sales you have.  Try to figure out which needs to be altered before compromising your pricing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! Absolutely, I'd be interested in an item exchange.  To trade, you both checkout with each others' items, and mark it as "paid" once it's received.  [Here](http://www.etsy.com/help/article/295) are some of Etsy's guidelines. They frown upon users who don't follow the regs, but it's not like it's that heavily policed.  I don't think they do a decent enough job with the trade rules on there.  When you both check out as "other," you have assurance that you'll be sent an item, and if something were to ever happen (I've done dozens of trades and everything has worked out so far, fingers crossed), you could take that up with Etsy to resolve.  Worst comes to worse, you leave a negative feedback on another seller's page, and they'll likely come around and fix it, because buyers so heavily rely on this %.  When you trade, you get 1 feedback for the item sold, and 1 feedback as a buyer as well.  (Assuming it's just 1 item.)  Hope this helps, write me if you have other questions! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all, my [shop](http://www.ragepaints.etsy.com) (and now my full time job   living!) are a direct result of being exposed to Reddit.  This is the first of my four shops, the rest of which I'll post later, when they're more developed.  I'm happy to see a new sub that seems like it's going to steer away from the monotony of r/etsy.

Please note, I'd be happy to trade (particularly decals) with other etsy users.  When new shops are beginning, feedback by trade is a wonderful way to boost credibility of your shop   build trust with potential customers.  Good luck, all!  Happy to be here. </TEXT>

In German I can't say "strasse" and I just put a hard, American "r" in there.
In Spanish (I'm lucky that I can roll my "r"s), but a lot of friends of mine just use a "d" in place of it.  Ex *perro*-*pedo* </TEXT>

Instead of having to put down like $200 at a casino to have decent leverage, we can just have a friendly game where you can buy back in only if you want to.  Or we can just hang out and drink.  Maybe we'll have a separate board game table for those who are less enthused about poker or are out early.

	<TITLE> Looking for a local softball league! </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm just one person (therefore not likely to source a team), and I've only been here for about 8 months.  I just finished my basketball season and kickball's about to start soon, but I'm really interested in joining a softball league.  I'd be happy to play 16" or regular softball, not too picky, it can be laid back or semi-competitive.  If anyone could point me in the direction of a team that needs a player, that would be truly appreciated!  I should mention I'm a girl. Coed or women's is a go.

Note: I have been asking around friends/rec centers </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How I realized I am not keto material. [Request] What do I do now? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [this](http://imgur.com/0gnzYrd), a picture of my kitchen countertop, can do all the talking for me.

I've been passively following r/keto, without having read the rules much.  I assumed the carb avoidance just applied for breads/grains, etc., stuff that "felt" thicker and substantial that would prevent fat from burning.  I know fruits have plenty of natural sugars but hadn't realized, before starting to use myfitnesspal (which is amazing, by the way), that I would consume 98% of my daily allowance...and be betrayed by my, before-now, trusty go-to snack.

My question is this.  I love the keto updates, and they keep me motivated, even if I don't participate as wholly as all of you seem to.  **Does anyone have suggestions for similar threads?**  I've been subscribed to r/loseit, r/eatcheapandhealthy, r/ketoreceipes and a few others, but a lot of what I see every day comes from here.

The other day when I saw someone had cheated by eating a banana, I felt like I don't belong here. :( Kudos to all of you, though!!! And thank you for the motivation! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Long story short, I relapse every.single.weekend.  I've been back and forth with the same 5 lbs for months.  It's damn near impossible to not go out with friends to a restaurant, to be social, or to go out drinking.  The past 2 times I've had Diet Cokes while everyone else gets shitty, which is fine, but boring.

How can I avoid the weekend gain with everyone boozing and eating constantly around me?  I don't want to be the black sheep but I want to stay focused!

Additionally, thanks r/loseit, for all the pics   stories!  I very much enjoy being subscribed to this sub, even though I don't contribute much. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello fellow Etsy redditors! My little sister has been diagnosed with anorexia (90lb/5'4") and I want to help her on her road to recovery by having baked goods show up periodically in the mail. I've done a series of staggered trades with other folks on Etsy for various items in my shop and built a good relationship with a few other users, but I thought I'd give r/Etsy a whirl and see if anyone here would be interested in anything in either shop [here](http://www.ragepaints.etsy.com) or [here](http://www.oakwoodleaves.etsy.com). The best part about trading through Etsy is that cost is minimal, and it's easy to ensure that you receive the incoming item in your trade by using "Other" as payment and leaving each other feedback. I used trades frequently early on with my setup of my second shop (Oakwood Leaves) to boost feedback and credibility within the Etsy community.

Another wonderful part of trading baked goods is that if you pick something from my inventory, it's easy to do an even trade by just baking X amount of cookies/brownies/whathaveyou you feel is a fair trade.

Thanks for reading! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What is the best way to keep my husband motivated? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Both my husband and I have started following r/loseit and it's awesome to see the progress everyone has made.  My question is not only pertaining to him but others around me, what is the best reinforcement for weight loss?  We've been continually eating healthy and I try to compliment.  However, weight has never been really mentioned in our relationship.  He's a bigger guy (6'3"/300-325?) but I've never much said anything about it because I don't care (he's active) and I'm very attracted to him physically anyway.  I don't want to draw attention to the fact that I noticed that he's lost a significant amount (he won't step on a scale still) because that means I have to acknowledge that there was that weight to lose, but he's probably lost 20-30 pounds, if I had to guess.

What should I do - just butt out because he's doing great?  I want him to keep it up, and show him that I'm proud of him, but I don't want to get in the way.

Also note: We are extremely open with each other in communication for every issue imaginable except this one - as I guess it's a little sensitive! </TEXT>

Secondly, I need to find out if it has a 6pin pci-e graphics card power adaptor?  I heard that most computers have them, but not sure where to look for that info either.

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

This is a long shot, but here goes! In the next month or two, I plan up on picking up my life and moving to Germany (Nordlich) or Switzerland (Zuerich/Bern). What I need to find before I go is a place to stay for a few weeks (maybe a month) in one of these places, on someones couch, while I look for a job. Id be more than willing to help pay for groceries or part of the rent. I speak English, German, and Spanish as well as very basic French. Im friendly and Im very clean and organized, and I like to go out exploring as well, whether it be the countryside or to parties (oder soll ich Partys sagen). Prefer to stay with girl/s. Would definitely have to skype beforehand. I don't anticipate a long stay - as I have a good CV and will be looking for a job all day every day until I find one and can stay (and find my own place) for good!

Also note: I already have my CV/cover letters translated and a lot of the job search done, its just a matter of moving. </TEXT>

I don't really need a lot (I'm satisfied with my 2 gig ram and 250 gig HDD netbook) BUT I want to get a computer that I will eventually share with my guy, and I want to make sure it has a good graphics card and whatever he needs for gaming. He usually plays SC and a few other older games like Diablo 2. What should I be looking for in terms of capabilities.........? Brand? I kind of want to stay away from Dell/HP.
The only thing I have my heart set on right now is dual 22" monitors but that's a minor detail. I need help with info about a graphics card or a video card and how much ram he'd need.
Thank you!

	<TEXT> I love making care packages and I love getting care packages. (Who doesn't?)  When I was abroad, I would send things home to people such as a little book (in the local language), candy, postcards, or other little trinkets I found fun and cultural, along with a letter.  

What I'm wondering is if someone would like to be sort of pen-pals and send each other things.  I'm from the US (Chicago) so naturally it would be neat to do this with someone from outside the US, but it might be cool to partner with someone from the coasts or something too.

Anyone interested? </TEXT>
