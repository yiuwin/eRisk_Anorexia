	<TEXT> Couldn't they do this with cortisol as well? Depression usually results in people having a larger amount of spiked cortisol during a stressful event, which then doesn't decrease as efficiently afterwards, compared to a person without depression.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the Citric Acid cycle, (the biological process that extracts energy from pyruvate to power metabolic processes in a majority of neural cells and other body parts) one of the steps involves adding a phosphate to the second carbon of a certain molecule, and then removing a phosphate in the third carbon of that same molecule that was already there to donate to the second carbon of a different (but structurally identical) molecule, so that molecule will then donate it's carbon 3 phosphate to the second carbon of another identical molecule, which then loses it's third carbon phosphate to donate to the C2 of another molecule and so on and so forth. 


So, there is this cyclic pattern of phosphates being donated and being lost to each sequential, identical molecule. 


But also, kind of like your typical chicken and the egg model, the big question that still remains is how did the first phosphate get donated, if there was no molecule before it that was identical to it that could have given it an extra phosphate *to* donate? WHERE DID THAT EXTRA C2 PHOSPHATE COME FROM??


Kinda makes you think about how awesome your body is, and how much we still don't know from a molecular standpoint.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn, I know exactly how you feel. :(


I don't take any medication or anything but I'm realizing that I really should be  because these bouts of irritability get really bad. 



Mine seems to be random too. Like one minute I'm okay and seemingly happy and the next minute, the irritability starts then I'm really depressed and the world just seems extremely sucky and there's no point to anything and I don't want any contact or interaction with anything or anyone, or I'm maniac and everything everyone does or says just pisses me off to no end and I just want to lash out against them.


I know exactly how you feel about how if everything isn't perfect it just makes you want to explode. If there is a tiny little detail in my day that didn't make sense or didn't turn out the way I wanted, my mind just keeps coming back to it and I want to just want to punch it all away.


The worst part is, I tend to lash out against the one person who actually cares about me when this is happening, because he's the only one who's around and trying to cheer me up or figure out what's wrong. 


But him asking me whats wrong or trying to cheer me up just makes it worse and I get more irritable and lash out some more and he's  stuck struggling to desperately fix it and I'm getting angrier as he's genuinely trying to make it better, but he doesn't realize that nothing he can do or say can make it better, and it just turns into this big icky mess where at the end of it all,  I just don't want to exist anymore  :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that's great! And very respectable and shows that you care about the well being of your children! But my question is, why does OP hate only black Americans, as if they are the only race who are capable of acting trashy or ghetto or uneducated??


Why do people automatically associate ghetto or trashy behavior with blacks in the U.S.?


These kinds of assumptions cause prejudices which can spout ignorance and racism, all of which people have fought long and hard to try to minimize 50-60 years ago! 


To me, these kinds of generalizations just lead us to function backwards as a society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can be done anytime you want.

I'm not looking to be persuaded by you or anyone else.


I'm simply trying to understand why someone would hate a race so much based on fallacies that every other race has and will continue to exhibit.


What's going on is simple. OP is racist, because he believes in this profound association between the black American identity and negative generalizations. Really sad!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, he wrote that he straight up "hates black Americans", so excuse me for...misreading, I guess??


Nowhere does he say that he hates the stereotypes of black Americans so much that he refuses to consider himself black. If he worded it that way, it would be a bit more understandable.


He also doesn't seem to be defending his point by saying that he hates the stereotypes surrounding the black American persona and that is the reason why he refuses to associate himself to them.


Nope! Instead he's embellishing this notion that *yes*, black Americans are whatever stereotypes society has perpetuated, and *yes*, people of other races are superior to them in many regards.


Read some of his comments, and tell me that he doesn't support the negative generalization of black Americans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't understand what the point of this post and all of your other hateful comments were for.


You just said you hate all black American people, making yourself a self-proclaimed racist, and now you're saying you wouldn't care if your child dated a black American, as long as they were successful? 

Well, I hope you know that there are successful and unsuccessful people of every race. Why did you feel you needed to make a distinction between the unsuccessful black American people from the other unsuccessful people of other races? Why do you hate these people more so than any other people who are unsuccessful?


It's clear you have made a strong, negative, association towards black Americans, and that is where your hatred for them is derived. 


But to feel that way about all black Americans, until they prove to you that they are worthy in your eyes, is a very ignorant, simplistic and dangerous viewpoint. And it does make you a racist. 


TL;DR: There are good and bad people of every race. Why hate one race over another? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But the whole point of this post of yours was to declare that you hate black Americans and you don't want to associate yourself with them because you believe they're all ghetto, entitled, scoundrels. 


So it would appear as though you would care whether or not your child dated a black American, considering you hold such strong, negative prejudices against them as a whole. 


Anyways, that's your problem. You have issues you need to sort out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh my goodness. You are the most ignorant, hate filled, overly simplistic person to walk the earth.

And it sickens me that some of the people here are supporting your fucked up view. 


When is it okay to be so negative and generalize about an entire race of people? Just because you are the same race and come from a different country, you think you can be a little racist prick?


Grow up and stop trying to make yourself seem better than a group of people based on your own personal experiences. 


If you don't like to associate yourself with black Americans, fine don't. But stop trying to spread and support the negative image that you have in your mind about black Americans to other people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you SURE those aren't just really old pictures, and she's recently lost a buncha weight?? If you like everything else about her, but her weight, why don't you try encouraging her to exercise and eat healthier. You can make it fun, like have a time where you both workout or something.


 It's a shame that you feel emotionally attached to her, and like everything about her but the size issue. As for the makeup, you should know makeup can completely change how a person looks like, and if you can't stand looking at her without her makeup, well then that's just a shame, and maybe it's best to discontinue things before she gets too invested in you.
