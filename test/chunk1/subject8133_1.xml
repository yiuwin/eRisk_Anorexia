	<TEXT> I ended up reading 11.22.63. Brilliant, kinda sad to see it end and I loved the little tie in to Derry. I was reading it around the anniversary of JFK so there was a lot of docos and stuff on TV so watching that and going back to the book and seeing him mention certain events was great.
He really did his research for 11.22.63 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like the title says, just finished the monstrosity IT and am a little undecided on what to read next. I've only read Misery, The long walk and IT. I'm leaning towards The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon or 11.22.63.
Suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ITAP of my 9year old Autistic son </TITLE>

This is my 9 year old son. He was diagnosed with Autism when he was 3, so you can imagine he is quite the character.
On this day I had intended to do some seascape photography and I took the family as I sometimes do, usually they go one way to search for shells and other treasures and I go the other to do my thing.
I noticed him standing on a hill watching the ocean on the left and the sun setting to his right, and he just seemed to be transfixed in that spot, he was somewhere else entirely. This is pretty common behaviour for him. He can lose himself in a moment at any given time and I often wonder what he is feeling/thinking. I am not much of a portrait photographer but I think for the first time I really caught the essence of him.
Later when I showed him the picture I asked him what he was doing standing in that spot for so long. He replied "I went to my own place" </TEXT>
