Az is what I got called at school so for me it fits perfectly! I have tried many times to think of a new name and I know friends who have but they can never find a new one! Patient Nathan is pretty good though!

	<TEXT> I always tend to keep some of my money for emergencies..

1) If I see a spot I want to settle to buy a settler. 
2) If I need a building to be able to get a wonder. 
3) If I need to up my army quickly because i'm attacking/getting attacked. 
4) Upgrading my land caravans to sea caravans to get more income. 


These are probably the ways I spend gold, I also forgot to mention spending 500 here and there on City States to get luxury resources is really helpful! 

I know this game is highly situational so I hope I helped somewhat!

	<TEXT> The way I play is that I tend to build a city which is fairy production/military based and the others behind it are less defensive but make more gold etc. 

I recent game i'm playing I had a strategic settle and trained the majority of my units through this one city with a barracks and walls built to ensure safety. 

Also I can't stress how important checking the diplomacy tab on the top right of the screen. It let's you see the GDP, who's the the 'pointiest sticks' etc. It's the best tool in the game imo. 

Just keep playing and you'll get used to it!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why should you have a break? I view Mary J as I view alcohol. Everything in moderation. I live in the UK so it's still illegal here so I tend to do it with friends as a social aspect to get people talking. 

You never hear people saying, i'm having a break from alcohol so why have a break from weed? If you don't think it's a problem in your life (and I doubt it is) then why stop it? If you can enjoy it responsibly and not get high all the time you can still have all the perks you have found (fitter body, girlfriend, etc) and still smoke. 

I lived with two people who smoked everyday and it affected their lives to the point that they became recluses. I saw this and my life has taken the turn similarly to yours. Don't stress about using it, it comes and goes. Just embrace it when you want to! 

I smoke perhaps 2-3 times a week and still feel high and enjoy all the effects! Smoking too much lessens the effects and makes it less enjoyable I feel! Hope I helped bro!

	<TEXT> I believe the same as you, I am fairly new Buddhist been reading into it for the past 10-12 months and I see myself getting married and having children.

I think you are correct when you say that people can be attached to Dharma itself definitely. 

I think you have to take what the Buddha says with a pinch of salt as like you rightly said, we are not the Buddha and we live in very different circumstances to what he lived in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a beautiful way to view relationships, but they are still indeed attachments to some degree. The way I would interpret it would be the same way this person has interpreted it. 

I understand that grief will arise by means of separation from the partner or by death but even having admirable friends (kalynamitta) would do the same would it not? 

You just need to know in your head that nothing in certain, that change is inevitable and that people you become close with will pass away or will lose contact with you. Always keep that in your mind and you can have relationships without the grief I believe. 

I think this is where Buddhism comes into it's own light here, you can read it as you like! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't mean to sound big headed but I normally play with a random civ on a random map. It's the only way I feel I can play civ fairly. I normally play on emperor as well. 

If you find out the skills of the civ you've been given you should be able to win by using the strengths of your civs. 

I mean i've started so many games just to get wiped out by turn 150 by Shaka or Atilla. It's just the game though, which makes it great! I would post some screenshots but I tend to play civ over a couple of days! 

Try it though, random civ, random map, standard map size, and a comfortable difficulty. It's a true test! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say checking the demographics tab on the top right then looking at which civ has the highest literacy level. This means this civ has progressed furthest on the tech tree. Putting your spy when you first get them on this civ may give you better technologies than putting them on someone lower. 

I also try to get them stealing technologies early so the spy can level up earlier. Gaining levels early on in the game can really stop civs spying on your main. 

Someone please correct me if i'm wrong but that's my techniques! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am by no needs of an expert in these types of things and my feelings are with you through and through. 

My only advice would be to be there for her. I wouldn't say making her see the way of Buddhsim will work. I understand Buddhism as something you come to realise yourself and no matter how much you try to help someone understand, it won't help unless they want to understand. 

As for the notes regarding her wanting to take her life, let her know what is good in life and why she should stay. Talk to her about it. Perhaps her emotions are pent up inside and the only way she can release them is by putting them on paper. 

What I said may not have helped but I wish you and your mother well and I hope that the situation improves. Stay strong my friend.

After looking over them, I thought that I wouldn't be a 'good' buddhist not adhering to all of the precepts but it's nice how it's seen as a 'practise' not a club. Thanks for your answer again, helped a lot!

I've tried to look for Buddhist groups where I live but there doesn't seem to be much going on unfortunately!

Thanks for the books, i'll have a look at them and hopefully it'll give me some more insight into Buddhism!  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello everyone, 

I've been reading about Buddhism for a couple of weeks now and i'm coming to understand it and think it's for me. I have taken some books out from my university library yet i've had trouble understanding these due to the complex language used. This is due to them being rather academic texts!

I'm looking for other means to access information about Buddhism. Could anyone point me in the direction of somewhere useful whether it be a book or internet resource that enabled you to understand Buddhism fully. 

I've been reading about the precepts and i'm confused about the fact Buddhist's aren't vegetarian. One of the precepts takes into consideration killing. Isn't eating meat killing an animal? 

Many thanks
