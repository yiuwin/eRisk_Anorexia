	<TEXT> The character of CJ has a very good arc: from Press Secretary to Chief of Staff. She also carried a few episodes on her own (The Long Goodbye and Access). Not saying she should be that highly ranked but I think her importance to the story across the 7 seasons needs to be considered. 

Overall I agree with others who've already posted. The list is rather odd and many characters are ranked either way too high to way too low. 

Edit: spelling and grammar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Likely none of the actors who played her relatives before were available. So they wrote this storyline about her family not being supportive and used her recovering addict issue as an excuse/reason. A bit of a stretch as far as I'm concerned but whatever (note I stopped watching Private Practice before her character appeared so I know less of her backstory). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think the people who post here are exactly a representative sample of all the people currently living in homes, whether that be apartments or condos who cannot control when the air conditioning is turned on. I live in one of those buildings and have been suffering with 30 degrees C for the past week or so.

I think it's time for the city to re-consider the dates for when the heat should be on. A quick examination of the temperature rates for the past couple of years probably indicates May has been a lot warmer than previously. Maybe this will pass or maybe it's permanent. I don't know how many years of data we need before we change the date. But it should at least be considered. </TEXT>

It was fascinating to see an image you're familiar with, watch it morph through its various phases that you don't immediately recognize then all of a sudden it takes shape and you know exactly what building/intersection it represents. I thought the St. Lawrence Market and the Flatiron building were especially well done. Would have loved to have seen the Wheat Sheaf Tavern over the years.

I noticed in the credits it was made in 2008. I wonder if this is the first time it's being shared publicly?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've wondered about what exactly happened to Zoey physically and mentally when she was kidnapped. I do recall her having facial injuries and a broken arm (shoulder?). It was clearly stated at the hospital after her release that she was not sexually assaulted. They did make some reference to PTSD during her Fourth of July celebration appearance at the White House and some carry-through on her healing when she went to stay at the farm with her mother. However, I would have thought the mental part (did the kidnappers verbally abuse her?, what impact did the physical injuries have on her psychologically?) might make someone scarred for life. It's never mentioned in later seasons so we have to assume she recovers completely. Or they just wanted to drop the storyline. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm the exception. I loved season 2. It's probably my favourite. I think that's because I grew up in a city with strong unions, a dock industry as well as other manufacturing plants that suffered like in Baltimore. In addition, the dock workers reminded me of people I grew up with. Blue collar folks trying their best. For me watching it was like putting on an old, comfortable pair of shoes. 

I actually disliked season 4 because I had no interest in the Baltimore school system or following a storyline that focused so much on children. 

I recognize I'm in the minority but to each their own. </TEXT>

In one of the early episodes point Josh asks Donna whether he has a desk yet (unless that's a flashback I'm recalling). Also Charlie is interviewed early on and I don't think the president would go 7 or 8 months without a body man.

Divorces take different times for different reasons depending on how complex the separation of assets are, whether any issues are contested or even how long it takes to sign the final papers. Some people sit on this last step for months or even longer. Unless the other party is pushing it nothing will happen. Also the lawyers' schedules can be a factor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks everyone for your responses.

This is my second re-watch and right now I'm just at the beginning of Season 4. 

If I recall correctly there's a scene in the very last episode where they flash forward (??) to a discussion with Bartlet, CJ, Charlie, I think Will Bailey and Kate Harper. I can't recall if Josh or Toby are there but I think there's a discussion with Charlie about Zoey. I know they get back together and I think it ends that way but there's definitely some plot holes over the seasons.

Another thread here has already discussed storyline issues with Charlie's education. I still find it fascinating that they never developed the character of Charlie's sister given the importance she played in his motivation for why he was looking for a job in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think Zoey Bartlet appears in Season 3. When she returns in Season 4 she's dating that French guy, Jean Paul. When did Zoey break up with Charlie?

Also I don't think Danny Concannon appears in Season 3 either. I know he went on assignment but was his absence acknowledged at the beginning of Season 3? He just reappears in Season 4.

Toby and his wife Andy attempt to conceive a child through IVF. I believe this is first introduced via flashbacks (Season 3?). Were they still married at the time of the flashback? How much time passed after they got divorced before she got pregnant (did they knowingly attempt to conceive while they were separated/divorced)? I don't get the purpose of this storyline other than to set up the investigation with Andy.

Thanks for any feedback. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it does seem fair. Interesting that it's never been implemented (to the best of my knowledge). Perhaps it is too expensive for clothes manufacturers to apply these multi-level pricing schemes within each product line?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Based on that logic everyone who buys size small of a shirt, sweater or pair of pants that is priced exactly the same for medium and large, which clearly use more material to make should pay less. For example, $5.00 for size small underwear, $6.00 for medium and $7.00 for large. 

Why should smaller people subsidize the clothes for larger people? </TEXT>

"The Act, which would have granted Ireland its own parliament similar in function to Canadas, was the product of a long constitutional struggle for Home Rule by Irish nationalists."

I thought things like this only happened in movies and on TV.

	<TEXT> Thank you for your response. As I understand your explanation this would imply that if you spent most of your time writing over reading or watching tv it would be easier to write. Is that what you meant? Like a muscle that gets used more works better/faster? If so, I'm not sure this explanation is correct. I spend more time writing than I do reading or watching tv yet it always requires so much more effort to write. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was watching recorded show on PVR when it happened. After the alarm and on-screen message I lost my sound. Had to rewind and put on the CC to follow the show when I pressed exit to remove the message. I couldn't even read it; something from the OPP? 

I'm not sure this is the best way to make these types of announcements. Do they have permission from the CRTC to interrupt the cable signal? AFAIK there was no warning they would be using this type of system, which makes it more of an annoyance than a service. </TEXT>
