Maybe, just maybe if we would have retained two of his top targets, then he would have stayed. I just don't get the logic. When you have a franchise QB, you do everything you can to surround him with weapons and build around him. Why is that so hard for this organization to understand? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you're suggesting we play a 4-3-3, correct? I think that would be best considering our current options. Move Ozil to the wing, and play Xhaka, Ox, and Ramsey/Coq/Elneny (whichever one has their head out of their ass at any given time). This would help us to control the midfield, something we haven't been able to do recently.  </TEXT>

I'm just sick of the spineless performances, I'm sick of our players not being physically as strong as our opponents, I'm sick of our players getting perpetually injured, and I'm sick of bottling it every fucking year.

I hope we finish outside the top 4 and I hope Spurs finish above us because maybe the board will finally realize that there's a fucking problem with how things are going. It's not good enough. I don't care how bad that sounds, but we need a change.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. Colt McCoy is a backup for a reason. What has he done in his career to suggest that he could win us games? Maybe if we had a good run game and a great defense, but we have neither of the two. We have a top passing offense, and we need a top QB for that to be executed. Colt McCoy won a fluke game at Dallas a few years ago, so everyone thinks he'd be able to start at QB and succeed, but I don't have faith in him. </TEXT>

Article basically says that the Bears aren't going to tag him and he'll be hitting the open market. Do you think our front office may be keeping an eye on him, and maybe that's why Jackson and Garon haven't been offered anything? 

Yes this is a shitpost, but I think one of the reasons that Garon and Jackson haven't been offered anything are because of the other options that will be available. I think even though our defense is shit and needs improved the most, the focus will still probably be on the offense. Whether it's Jeffery or some other guy, I feel like at this point we're letting both walk and signing someone new. Jeffery would be a good addition if he can get his act together.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why do you think that? What has he shown in the past two years to suggest that he's first team quality? We should sell him while he's still worth something in my opinion. If he continues on this path his value will decline each year we hold onto him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see a lot of negativity about Mustafi, but remember how good he was up until around January. He didn't lose a game with us until January. It's not a coincidence, he's a good CB. He's been great in my eyes, bar the last month or so.

Xhaka has been alright I suppose. I expected more from him as a distributor. I was hoping he'd be able to play similarly to santi in that area of the game, but he hasn't created a whole lot. Still not sure how I feel about him.

Lucas has been good almost every time he's played. I think he needs to be in the first team. I think he could be something we need because he's much more direct than Iwobi is and I think he will contribute to the goals that have been lacking recently. 

Holding seems like he has a bright future. I like how composed on the ball he is. His defensive work is decent, and I could see him becoming one of the better CB's in England eventually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We'd need a running game and a good defense to win with either of those QB's, something we don't have and probably won't have next year. So no. We need to stick with Kirk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A win is a win in my book. It wasn't a great game but did it really need to be? 2-0 is perfectly fine with me. Didn't think anyone played particularly well but all that matters is the scoreline at the end of the game. 

Sutton also played quite well. Their play didn't look like a non-league team at some points. Gotta give them some credit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes it is Bayern, but they have not been amazing recently. But of course we make them look so much better. I don't get why we don't pursue the ball, it just doesn't make any sense to me. Jesus fuck I hate this. Hopefully our next manager will actually have some common fucking sense when it comes to pressing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we should sell one of Monreal or Gibbs and go for a top left back, like Jose Gaya, Ricardo Rodriguez, maybe even Alex Sandro. 

I think we may already have the option in our team, but a good box to box midfielder would be key as well, but I want to see Ox in the role for a while to see if he might be what we're missing. From what I've seen of him there so far, he seems like a viable option. Partner him or Wilshere up with Xhaka and I think that could be a solid midfield. 

We need someone who poses a scoring threat other than Alexis, which again I think we already have with the rotation of attackers we have. If one isn't playing well, then another steps in and is ready to play. We have the likes of Walcott, Iwobi, Welbeck, and Perez, who can all step in and put in a shift.

What we really need is a manager. Someone who has the winning mentality and can inspire the players to do the same. Look what Conte has done with Chelsea, we don't even need that drastic of a mentality change, we just need to get over the tipping point. I like Allegri considering that Juve is a very mentally strong team.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But since they've been here they've shown they are world class and I think could fit into just about any XI at this point. Both would certainly fit into PSG who can offer more money and titles for them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thrashing Aston Villa in the FA Cup final was amazing. I also really liked seeing us manage to dig ourselves out of the hole Arsene created by not taking CL group stage matches as seriously as he should have last season, especially beating Bayern as well as Girouds hat trick against olympiakos. The annihilation of Man United last season was great as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd argue that both do at the moment. When you can't complete passes and give the ball away all the time that's down to the players for not executing, but the fact that we aren't dangerous in the box is definitely the tactics </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we should drastically change the team for the rest of the season. This current XI has no passion whatsoever. None. We don't have the mentality to go and get the fucking ball and score. Massive changes need to happen. We can't win the title now so why not try some new things out </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chelsea players pursue the ball and close down. When they are defending, they want the ball back, and for some reason we don't do the same. Our players are content to sit back and do nothing. I hate it. We need a mindset change. I'm not sure how it will happen, but it has to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't understand how we struggle to beat Burnley, completely dismantle Southampton, and then lose at home to a team that hasn't won a game in 7. I just don't understand. 

Could have made great progress in the table with a win, the fucking state of this team just hurts to watch. Just horrible today.  </TEXT>
