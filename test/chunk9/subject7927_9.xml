I always check the link in reddit to see if it was already posted.. Nothing came up under this link. So I thought for once I got lucky!
I wouldn't repost something knowing it was already posted!
It actually makes me so annoyed when I see things re posted and people are like  drooling over it ... and in my head I'm like wtf I saw this a month ago... </TEXT>

I had to read the comments to confirm this was actually drawn. 

Now I see it in the fingers...  But I still don't believe it isn't a photo.
This is seriously amazing ! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work in childcare aswell. This is a huuuuuuuge deal .. at my centre the would have gotten in huge shit for it. A serious occurrence would have been reported. A documentation would have been posted for all parents and staff to read. This is insane. I do a head count every time we leave and go to a new location. I also do it once in a while when we are in a location for more then 30 minutes. Even just for my own sanity!!!  

Just the fact that the supervisor kept it from you she should have garton in shit for it. !!!!! 


The discount thing is annoying. If it wasn't for that i would be so pissed off. 


But again these things happen yes that's true. But to keep it from you!!! That's what is pissing me off the most.

Sorry for my rant. I just can't believe that.. well I can. It's just messed up </TEXT>
