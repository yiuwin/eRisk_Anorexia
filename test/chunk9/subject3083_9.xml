	<TEXT> I'm so fucking sad . I binged today but it's not even just about that 

I feel like I have realised that I can't stand the person I am. I hate myself.

It's so much more than that . I guess I am just considering my worth and contemplating the idea that I'm just not worth it . 

I don't deserve this beautiful world I think I may be considering tapping out. </TEXT>
