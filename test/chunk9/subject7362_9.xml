	<TEXT>  I suppose it's probable androids don't have an internal monologue because their brains work so differently. But even if a telepath can't understand an android's thoughts outright, it seems that they might still sense their motivations and intentions on a more abstract level.

yes, an android is an automaton made (in this case) by a human to appear to human senses (vision, sound, touch) as if it was human. being human, soong probably didn't put any thought into how data, lore, and juliana would manifest to other senses that are impossible for him to experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That's an interesting way to think.
 
Thank you

 So if sexual harassment cases and rape cases were split down the middle, would it make it ok then?

nope, harassment and rape are never ok

 If guys were harassed more than girls, would calling someone a dick be outrageous?

but that never, ever happens 

 What do you mean by consent of the target? Do we have to get consent to yell something at someone?

If someone is going to tell thousands of people what to do with my genitals I would prefer they run it by me first

 Who do you think hears that guy and thinks "golly, I guess rape is now ok?" That seems ridiculous. Why do you think that?

I think someone might hear it and think "this is how we treat women". this is by far the most important point here. Nothing else I've said is even remotely as important as this.
 
 FHRITP is not even suggesting rape and it's obviously not suggesting murder. To compare it to yelling HHFAT is in poor taste.

I was using HHFAT (something I made up) as an analog. if you can't follow the comparison we're obviously on totally different pages. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well we live in a culture where one of the two most common genders is a victim of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape much more than the other. And FHRITP happens much more frequently to that gender. And it explicitly refers to the genitalia of that gender, and could be perceived to be referring to the genitalia of that individual person. And it is a declarative statement intended to be heard by thousands of people and happens without the consent or foreknowledge of the target. It certainly perpetuates rape culture, and under some circumstances could be perceived as incitement to rape. What if instead of FHRITP it was HHFAT (Hang Him/Her From A Tree) and people shouted it at black people on live television? Yes, it's an "outrageous thing to yell in public", but it's much worse than that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think getting the cops involved because someone shouted a joke with obscenities at you is a bit much.

I don't know. It always targets a certain demographic and it generally takes advantage of a power differential (anonymity can be a powerful weapon when trying to publicly humiliate someone, although this bozo didn't seem to get away with it). As such I'd say it's at least harassment and possibly sexual harassment, although I'm no legal expert by any means. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd repeat what the others have said: There aren't a lot of jump scares, but there is tons of gore. And I'll add something: There's a fair bit of psychological horror, like knowing there is an impending death, or getting really attached to a favourite character and suddenly they get violently and unexpectedly killed. My first watch, a binge of the first three seasons, left me feeling somewhat traumatized.

	<TEXT> I don't think "longer" is the proper term to use, since both sets are infinite and never ending. I think the term that is used is "stronger", as in certain infinite sets are stronger than others. One infinity can be stronger than another by including certain properties/quantities that the the other has no analog for. </TEXT>
