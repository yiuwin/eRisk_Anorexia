	<TEXT> I feel horrible for doing this...
A couple of buddies and I were at a house party late one night. I turn to one of my friends and say, "we should take some of those dried mushrooms on top of the fridge, put them in a ziplock, and convince the next person who walks in that they're magical.
My buddy Jeff walks in and my other friend, Zack, says "hey, we got some shrooms if you wanna trip." Jeff, of course, says yes. So we divide up the bag between the 3 of us (we figured us eating them too would really sell the lie) and chow down. I throw all of mine into my mouth, begin chewing, and immediately regret it. I sprint over to the sink and spit up everything in my mouth and begin to gag into a trash can. From behind, I overhear Jeff say, "what are you doing man?! Those are still good!!" He walks his way over to the cabinet, grabs a hotdog bun, and scoops everything out of the sink into the hotdog bun. Eats it.
My buddy Zack and I have tears in our eyes from holding back the laughter. After Jeff gags down my puke, he looks into of the fridge, has a curious look on his face then says, "those weren't real, were they?" Rotfl doesn't do it justice. I couldn't breath I was laughing so hard. 

I look back on it now and regret it. It was a terrible thing for me to do. BUT! The good news: Jeff and I became best friends after that. He is the best man at my wedding coming up in June.  </TEXT>
