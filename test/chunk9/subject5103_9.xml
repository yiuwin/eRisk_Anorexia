	<TITLE> How do I navigate creating the legal mumbo-jumbo for a start up? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-01 19:48:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not looking for "talk to a lawyer" or "use legal zoom" advice. My co-founders and I will probably look into both. I am more curious about what types of legal protections/disclaimers/documents other people have used or found not useful. I don't want to just hand over a bunch of money to a lawyer for something I don't need...

In case this helps - more specifically - the company we are starting will provide sales organizations with more quality 1st meetings/leads/opportunities. So we will be selling to mostly sub 1000 employee companies with decent-sized sales teams.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been in sales for nearly 10 years now. I just learned MEDDIC at my most recentl job (6mos) and it has completely changed my (sales) life.

The underlying principle is that you can apply MEDDIC to any opportunity you are working at anytime and you'll be able to clearly understand what you already know and what you still need to gather... and this allows you to make each subsequent call/meeting/demo/event more productive and targeted and with a purpose. </TEXT>
