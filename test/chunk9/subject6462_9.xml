	<TEXT> UGH YES TO THIS. I have the exact same problem. If I gain even a fraction of a pound, I spend the rest of my day stewing in self-hatred. But if I lose? It's like my brain decides that means it's time to binge. 

So please just know you're not alone. It's fucking hard and as much as I want to stop weighing myself daily I'm so scared that if I do I'll instantly gain.  </TEXT>

This weekend wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be. I fasted until dinner time (easy to pull off as I was hungover/tired and not hungry), and ate Poke bowls for dinner both nights. We also walked around a lot so I'm hoping I burned off at least some of what I ate.  </TEXT>
