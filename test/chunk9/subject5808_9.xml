	<TEXT> Hey ya'll. Bit of a question.

So I'm trying to get into cooking my own dinners but I always face the issue of overbuying when cooking for one. I don't have any room in the fridge at home as it belongs to my housemate and is at capacity. I've resorted to just eating out but I want to start saving some dollars and eating a bit healthier.

So what kind of options do you guys suggest for a person cooking for one with no food being able to be stored /  wasted.  </TEXT>
