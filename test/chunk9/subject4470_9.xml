	<TEXT> Toss the strips in a little Franks Red Hot (with a little butter melted in, of course) and you got a simple variation. Sub bleu cheese dressing or just some crumbles on top of ranch and you've got a tasty buffalo chicken taco. Truth be told: I usually have this in sandwich form, though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the video. Kinda confused, though, as to how it says anything relevant.

And many people watched their content and liked it enough to subscribe. Why would they decide this? I mean, wouldn't this just be seen as further enabling these criminal actions to occur? I surmise that most of the subscribers would say they did not condone the content within the videos. But yet, they watched anyways.   And now that the tables have somewhat turned, another faction of people are getting off on seeing these people get what's coming to them. People are dumb.

But these reactions that people are having are absurd. It's the same volatile reactions that people had when Chris Hanson was doing his thing.

This is not any different than what happens to all sorts of children every single day, but just because it's all of a sudden it's hyped on youtube, its now like some sort of new thing?

I mean come on. A shit ton of assholes made these morons popular on YouTube. That should be what is talked about. That is the problem. Idiots watching idiots breed idiots. 

Now just because this shit is visible people are all up on their high horses.  </TEXT>

Seriously..she just refuses. It can be pretty frustrating trying to show her tech stuff. Helps with my patience, though, I guess.

Maybe some apps are better than others? I can pause without any lag, right from my lockscreen. There is a lag  when seeking though. Everything has their pros and cons and for me being able to use my phone as an all-in-one and eliminate all those stupid remotes is pretty sweet.

E: So, I thought to google the boob for fun and damn...Between an NSFW image of him being the first image and several little snippets about him, he's actually got quite the name for himself outside of this place, thanks to this place. [Even *Forbes* has written about him](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fernandoalfonso/2016/06/01/cashing-in-karma-how-a-former-landscape-architect-turned-his-reddit-fame-into-a-career/#73fe05cc128a) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I may have an opportunity to visit Rome here in a few months, and of the many amazing famous landmarks that they have, the Victor is one that strikes me as kinda bleh. Something about it compared to all the much, much older stuff seems rather contrived.

Don't get me wrong, though, if I do indeed visit (I'd probably be stupid to pass up this opportunity), I'd still love to visit the monument.

	<TEXT> Does seem to be a natural sort of progression to start getting a little more experimental with their sounds. Which is pretty common with a ton of rock bands. Since Paramore has always leaned a bit on the poppier side of rock, I feel like this newest single reminded me of what No Doubt began to transform itself into towards the end. Like synth-wise, and the overall abundance of it, anyways. </TEXT>
