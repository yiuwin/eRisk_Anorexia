	<TEXT> Well said ,while they incorporate less government in their manifesto ,in actuality they enjoy the biggest benefits a state could offer .While they wax lyrical about privatisation of publicly owned enterprises  ,they run towards state when the commercially owned banks collapse .While they talk about alleviation of property ,they dole out tax cuts and credits to big corporate behemoths.
It's the sad story of almost any establishment anywhere in the world . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you love your wife and truly care for her ,then her giving away these flowers to her mother doesn't matter at all .Your intention was to make her happy and to show your love for her ,she acknowledged this but her way of appreciation was gifting it to her mum ( I'm assuming here that she's quite close to her mum and wanted to give her the best gift that she could possibly get ).While it'd be wise on her part to discuss it with you before taking such step,she might have got reasons of her own for doing so.At some point in time ,you can discuss this matter with her in a light manner ( I hope she'll appreciate your views) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you overanalyse/overthink common situations and then feel bad about it .Its usually a symptom of anxiety .Your confidence should not be contingent upon replies of other people .They could be busy ,forgetful or just lazy ,so please don't assume that they are ignoring you or annoyed with you .In your life's,you'll also face many rude and annoying people ,who will try to undermine your confidence on purpose ,what will you do then ?

	<TEXT> You are a generous ,sympathetic and loving person who is very sensitive in nature and facing some kind of inner turmoil .
You have an artistic bent of mind ,you love music ,books ,paintings and prefer indoor activity to outdoors .Your mind and your heart are struggling with each other ,as there is some kind of internal chaos .You are easily hurt and feel things deeply .You are emotional but don't show it .Its mostly your heart that dictates your decision though you often feel indecisive .
You have a sharp mind ,but prone to anxiety and depression .You have a good willpower as well ,but you are in search of something .
You are very cautious and you are wary of commitments in the matters of heart because you think that you'll be hurt if deeply involved .You trust few people and there is also some kind of a family conflict. </TEXT>
