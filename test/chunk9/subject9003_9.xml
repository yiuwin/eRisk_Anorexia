	<TEXT> This. Your base will look a lot like base for road racing but as you get closer to racing you will cut out a lot of hours and focus on quality. You focus more on VO2 max and Neuromuscular stuff than a roadie would. 10-15 hours a week is pretty average.

Some local pros and olympians that I know even do eight hour weeks when they are racing every weekend </TEXT>

On speedy days, I look at numbers in conjunction with how I feel. It's important to know your body. Your HR might be low because your legs are tired or weak. It might be high because you drank too much last night.

I never look at the numbers in a race. I would think that I was on the verge of blowing up just by looking at the numbers and slow down. It's also more fun to race by feel. </TEXT>

I was around 3.5 w/kg for 20' last August. I'm at 4.6 w/kg for 20' now. 

For seven of the last eight months, I was 90% of the time. Now, I'm riding my bike anywhere from 8 to 12 hours a week and running a stead 3 hours. My w/kg went up because I am newbie. Sure, I do hill reps, tempo sessions, and intervals. But, I do it because it's fun. If you are new, just ride your bike and have fun. You'll get faster.

If you are not new, go over to /r/velo and dig around for advice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Ah, totally new information! I just checked out Leadville and it's much higher elevated, had no idea! Seems like you know what you're talking about, and you've got the Colorado flag haha! I'm still doing my research in terms of destinations for altitude training, and what all is in Colorado to offer. You would recommend staying away from Boulder though? Would you mind elaborating a bit if you had time? Not saying you are wrong, I'm just curious as to why, to learn a bit more!
 

Go visit Boulder before you get a place there. It's a small city and a pretty cool one at that. If you like cool funky cities, then it might be your thing. There is a lot of homeless people, trustifarians, and generally self-absorbed people. You can find cool/genuine people in Boulder but you'll have to weed out the others. 

I think the small towns in Colorado are generally more enjoyable than the large ones. Leadville is definitely a good one. Also, as c6cycling said, Boulder is not very high at all. Currently people say you should sleep high and train low. I sleep at 8,500' and train around 6,500 most of the time. I still think there is an advantage to touch on the high altitude stuff once in a while. So, in the summer I'll hit 12k-14k ft on my long runs or long mtb rides. Also, don't be afraid to get dirty! Bring a MTB! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-03-16 00:51:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've just started training and I'm riding the road and stationary bike in the gym. I've noticed that there is a big difference in my HR.


Last week I did this on the **road**:

Going up Mount Lemmon, Arizona: 157bpm for ~1'50"

Going down: 167 for ~40"

My tempo range is about 155-175 bpm. Going up felt like easy tempo and going down felt like a moderate tempo. My perceived efforts map up with my HR zones

On the **trainer**:

Perceived high tempo/low thresh trainer ride: 144bpm for 40"

Perceived FTP intervals: 4x10" Averaging 160bpm


Why is my HR so low on the trainer? I haven't cycled consistently since early August but I have been running. I have been doing about 70 mpw and 8k ft of climbing the last couple months.

I've got a race I'm preparing for in late May. What should I be doing? Do I need to do cycling specific strength training? Is this a fair comparison to begin with? </TEXT>

We evaded homework by unanimously convincing her that she never assigned it. 

We all skipped class a couple of times and convinced her that she told us to meet in the computer lab. 

One time we all skipped class except for Dan. Dan forgot and ruined it. Fucking Dan

We made signs with the responses to each others verbal exams. She would face away from us and the test taker would face us. 


We locked her in a walk in closet while she was playing the guitar. 


We locked her outside of the classroom. 


We locked the classroom so we couldn't have class that day.

	<TEXT> I was in your position a year ago. This is what I did.

1. Find out what size bike fits you best. 

2. Look on craigslist for bikes that are in your size and price range. 

3. Do research on the bikes that are available. 

4. Contact the owners of the bikes that interest you. 

5. Before you check out the bike, learn how to inspect a bike for wear. You can google search this but it will come down to the cranks, the cassette, chain, wheel true, and tires. 

Some people are fanatical about one bike frame over the other but a beginner probably won't be able to appreciate the nuances of nicer or more popular frames.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree that one should start on a full sus bike. I agree that they are more comfortable, especially in the *Rocky* Mountains. Starting on a hard tails forces you to improve your bike handling. 


I live in Durango and we have rock gardens on the smoothest of trails. When I first started, I was painfully slow. On strava I was at the bottom of the leaderboards. Today, just a couple of months after first stepping on a mtb, I rode Ranked in the top 20% of riders on the Dry Fork descent. I'm still riding a hardtail but I improved very quickly. I have a friend who also improved quickly on a hardtail. I have seen and ridden with a lot of new riders on full sus bikes. They usually lack the handling skills that will make you a better rider. 

I'm sure that a full suspension will be a lot of fun once I get to ride one but I don't think I would have truly appreciated how nice it was if I started with it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Phil's world is in Cortez but a good idea. 

In D-Town you can dick around in a couple mountain parks. 

The Horse Gulch trail system is a lot of fun but a little rocky. Check out the trails Snake Charmer and Anasazi descent 

-Overend mountain park, named after our local legend Ned Overed, has lots of fun flowy trails. Check out Snake Charmer!

-Animas City Mountain and Dalla mountain park are kind of one trail system. Do an Animas loop and link it up with Sailing Hawks if you like climbing. Bonus, stop and watch some pros boulder in Sailing Hawks. 

-Twin Buttes is a newer park that I have yet to explore but I hear great things about it!

-The Colorado trail (CT) offers so many awesome loops or shuttles. For a quick loop ride up the CT until you hit the dry fork and ride that into town. For a bigger loop, you can ride up the junction creek Forrest service road to High Point and ride the CT down to its start. Lastly, shuttle a car up to Kennebec and you have an epic ride on the CT down to town. 

-My favorite loop is a Haflin loop it's 20 miles and 3,000 vert. You climb Mount Baldy to Missionary Ridge and descend the beautiful Haflin Creek trail. 


There are so many more amazing rides but this will get you started. Check out Durango Outdoor's website for more information </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Skip the central Colorado stuff and come to the southwest. Phil's World, all the parks around Durango, Molas Pass to Cascade Creek, the Colorado trail, Moab are all filled with world class riding. In central Colorado you might get some cool downhill stuff but it's nothing too different than what you might find at a ski resort in the East coast. 


Trail riding in the southwest is unique and world class </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had my lbs install a BB and the cranks a couple months ago. After ~400 miles I noticed a clicking noise in the BB area. There was play in the drive side crank. I brought it back to the LBS to check it out. They found that the BB had no grease and that the BB shell was too big for the BB. They claimed that the shell would get bigger if I kept riding it, especially without grease. 


They greased the BB and said the BB fit into the frame better but there was still some play. Their solution was to use green loctite to secure it in place. 


Fast forward 300 miles and the noise and movement  is back. Is the frame a goner now? They installed the BB. So, are they at fault? Thanks for any help </TEXT>
