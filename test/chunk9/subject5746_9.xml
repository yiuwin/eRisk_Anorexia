	<TEXT> Sigh, before you reply again, please just read. My issue isn't with charging, it's that they at least appear to be charging a flat fee for the right to climb regardless of services used or not used that is revenue generating.   
My point was, and you'd get this if you actually read my original comment at any point, was that they should definitely **BE ABLE TO CHARGE FOR COSTS INCURRED**, but I dislike the idea of them charging a flat fee, again regardless of actual costs, much less them claiming the right of gatekeeper based on skill or any other criteria they might have (including, as you mentioned above stopping there from being "too many" climbers) unilaterally. </TEXT>

If there are costs involved, such as for base camps, rescues, and garbage pickup, then charge for those    

...

The fee, if any, just for the right to ascend should be solely for unavoidable and shared costs, such as garbage pickup and base camps.   

By just for the right to ascend, I meant above and beyond fees for services used, such as base camps, and thus I continue with:     

Any services above and beyond that should be charged on an as/if used basis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This guy is an absolute idiot, but I find it very uncomfortable that a government can take a natural wonder like Everest and enforce a fee for its use. If there are costs involved, such as for base camps, rescues, and garbage pickup, then charge for those, but charging a prohibitively large fee, with a qualification check, solely on the basis of the right to climb strikes me as going too far. The fee, if any, just for the right to ascend should be solely for unavoidable and shared costs, such as garbage pickup and base camps. Any services above and beyond that should be charged on an as/if used basis.  

In terms of protecting Everest from inexperienced and unprepared climbers, I take the very strong point of view that if idiots want to kill themselves, they should be allowed to. People haven't stopped trying to climb mountains because people die doing it and they aren't going to stop now regardless of whether Nepal actively tries to lower the number of deaths or not. </TEXT>

I'll resign myself to at least accepting, albeit not agreeing, with the rest of your comment, but I have to challenge one point. It's bit too late for the BBC to start caring about wasting licensing fees, and if they do care, then axing Torchwood, or going after any other individual program for that matter, is probably the wrong target. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Am I the only person not looking forward to this movie? Maybe it's partially that I know the history, but this strikes me as a movie that is going to be 3/4 random slaughter with a few intertwined main character stories thrown in with near death experiences for the main characters while their friends/cohorts die all around them. Towards the end there will be a turnaround where the characters coming to the rescue pick up the surviving characters, including the major characters we now know about both on the rescuers' and the soldiers' sides, and it will end with a text piece, or perhaps a voiceover about heroism.   

It's not just knowing the history though, I enjoyed Saving Private Ryan and plenty of other pseudo-historical, plus several much more historical, large movies. </TEXT>

IMO this just shows how screwed up universities' claims towards student and faculty IP are. It's fair that the university should get something if their equipment, paid time, and/or IP owned by the university is used. Much of of the time the agreements that faculty or students either are forced to sign or are defacto held to as policy (even if not individually/specifically signed to, such as part of a code of conduct) are ridiculous and extortionate. </TEXT>

It's also because consumers want to buy large chickens, or large pieces of chicken, from their grocery stores and restaurants. It has become an expectation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMO reputable coin companies don't pull shit like this. I have heard anectdotally that other companies raise their prices based on availability and demand, and I don't doubt that they due, within reason, but I have yet to see, or be mentioned here, an actual example of Provident, APMEX, or one of the other major sellers **doubling** the price of a round, especially a single round in the middle of a series, and I doubt there is one.    
Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but the fact that they charged twice the price of the previous rounds in series, for no other reason than because they could, is IMO the icing on the cake that makes this pretty damn despicable. It also makes the people who paid that price suckers who overpaid (as is their right, of course).    
If something, anything, such as the mintage, had changed then it might be a different story, but this can't be excused as anything but greed and hubris. Hopefully enough people agree that it will bite BGASC in the ass, although the fact that most people here are "silver whores" (another commenter's term, not mine) does not give me hope that they'll be hurt by this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ordered from SGB because they weren't trying to gouge me and I waited (BGASC was the cheapest initially, but their price was still ridiculous). Free shipping was definitely a factor in me choosing to buy more now, but I bought more than I would have otherwise, even with the free shipping, to reward them (and because I'm a silver addict).   

I'll give silver dealers a lot of leeway and a lot of slack when it comes to honest mistakes or issues, but this was nakedly taking advantage of the fact that they had a period where they were the exclusivivity to charge well above what would otherwise be "fair," in effect in-line with the price the previous prices in the set sold for. I hold no I'll will to people who paid that price, other than chuckling at how much they overpaid. I do however hold it against the seller and this was unethical on their part after a reasonable expectation of price existed from the previous rounds. That being said, you are wrong, they could be much lower than any competitor and they'll still never get a cent of my money, and in addition I will publicly denounce them as a shady and unscrupulous seller to anyone who will listen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Accidentally re-posted this behind you (now deleted), but this makes me so happy. Hopefully more people held out than gave in and bought at the extortion price those assholes were charging.   

I plan on emailing Silver Gold Bull and thanking them for carrying it, as well as noting that I specifically bought more product to thank them (and admittedly to get free shipping). I'm tempted to also email BGASC to tel them to go fuck themselves and point them to the threads here noting that not only have they lost me as a customer for life, they've probably lost quite a few other people as well because of their price gouging antics. </TEXT>

There are enough people in Parliament, and the public, that see the monarchy as necessary, if not good, for for the stability and reputation it brings to the UK, and of course the not inconsiderable tourism revenue it brings in. Add in a bunch of suddenly destitute royals (the immediate royal family would be OK, but some of the outliers might be hurt) and it would be absolutely nuts. </TEXT>
