	<TEXT> Yeah, but how many songwriters does it take to make another junky track that I post on youtube and get 17 views?

One, baby. That's right. Just one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The person walking toward the chairs, but unable to ever get closer, transforms something that's initially serene into a much more interesting and symbolic image.

Maybe every one of us staring at this on a screen in a stuffy office, or depressing urban apartment, is that person trying to get there... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was never one to commemorate every anniversary of her passing, but during the long months that immediately followed I remember imagining what my life would be like ten years out. "Once I get to ten years," I told myself, "then I will have permission to be happy again."

And the truth is, I am for the most part. It actually started a few years back, probably around year 7, that my healing from the trauma seemed to take a huge jump. When I could allow myself to think about it--even talk about it--without falling into that vortex. 

I just found this sub and thought it would be worth sharing a small piece of my story and offering some encouragement that it gets better. It once felt like the sun would never shine again in my life, but it has. And we're not alone in these journeys we're on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I keep hearing more and more great things about that camera, and the evidence is right here. Kicking myself for recently buying a 70D when I could've had a mirrorless camera with a full sensor for a similar price.

Thanks for posting. Really enjoyed the video. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is really good, but for my tastes I prefer a more photo-realistic attention to detail.

	<TEXT> NFW - 4 CV Outs!!!

Now I just need to figure out what a "CV out" means, and how to use them, and then pick me up one of these bad boys. Or... maybe I'll just stick with a regular old Sub 37 which still does more than I need. </TEXT>

So many quotable lines from this move. Another (which I will butcher): "But if you screw up even this much you'll be flying cargo planes full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my favorite romance film of all time. I think its initial impact was muted by the fact that it was wrongly marketed as a chick-flick or some other sort of lighter fare. And Ethan Hawke wasn't taken seriously enough as an artist.

In fact, I consider this to be Linklater's masterpiece, even above Boyhood. His style as a director, and the improvisational abilities of Hawke and Delpy, is what produced such natural and hyper-realistic performances. </TEXT>
