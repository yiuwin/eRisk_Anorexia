They're so delusional that they think everyone against Trump is out to get them and that the MSM is brainwashing people into thinking Trump is the enemy because they have a "globalist" agenda. It's sad really.  </TEXT>

Yeahhhh... I'm gonna have to see actual proof to that claim.

"Posting stupid pictures with fake captions to circlejerk about"
You mean memes? So I suppose all subs that use memes are circlejerks, huh?

	<TEXT> 1. The hivemind that you're a part of assumes so.

2. [Hate examples from r/the_Donald over 132 days - compiled by tcw1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/5bp4a3/i_have_been_collecting_examples_of_hatred_from/)

Also, looking at your post history, you sure do love going into these anti-Trump subs to start arguments. It shows a lot about the type of supporters Trump has.

	<TEXT> They probably show these types of posts to potential recruits as an example of the West's hatred towards Islam. They don't realise that by alienating a whole group of people, you're making them more susceptible to radicalization. </TEXT>
