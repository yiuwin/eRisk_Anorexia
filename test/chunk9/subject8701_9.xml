I absolutely *love* "The Caves of Androzani", which is the 5th Doctor's last story. Should be easy to find. 

"Genesis of the Daleks" is good too as it is the first time you get to see Davros. 

Also check out "The Five Doctors"

If you can (and they used to be on YouTube), watch at least the very first episodes of the show, if you have not already. They are surprisingly good.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tend to avoid Doctor Who fans like the plague. Most don't seem to realise that the show existed before Christopher Eccelston, and nowadays it seems to be all about 'shipping' characters with one another.

I struggle to see how Olivia Colman would work, though. Peter Capaldi had, obviously, been in Torchwood and in Doctor Who. It was hard enough passing off the fact that the Doctor just managed to turn into somebody who he has encountered twice in his history. Olivia Colman has already been in Doctor Who, and I don't think they should go down the same route twice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can vet them to a point, I agree. There is no way in which you can 100% guarantee somebody is not lying. However, many of the stories are based upon multiple sources. You will find very few which rely on just a single source unless that source is INCREDIBLY reputable.

For example; it is likely that the Comey story from a couple of days ago (or maybe it was yesterday?) was actually leaked by Comey. The journalists would have known it was Comey speaking to them. Would you really need to vet any more than that? The guy is not exactly a liar. 

I would say more sources in the mainstream media are accurate. Companies don't thrive by making up lies (except Fox News, for some very odd reason) </TEXT>

Huffington Post may be a little bit different due to the way they work. I have never written for them. I know that some of the stories are just put up without any editorial control, but I don't think that happens on the news side of things. Other major websites (New York Times etc.) will put sources through multiple checks. </TEXT>

Veganism is a mental illness. Sadly, you can't really evolve out of a mental illness, others will pop up. You have to learn what causes veganism to begin with. I don't think it is an inherited disease. It may not even be a genetic condition.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some vegan told me:

"Don't drink milk, would you still drink from your mother's breast"

So, according to her, you love milk because you love your mother's boobs.

If you love eggs, you also love to eat period (her words, not mine) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I mean, I know what terrorism is.

I would not say that this meets the definition of terrorism. What was their political aim in attacking these people? It was just senseless violence. I think in order to be terrorism, you need to have a specific agenda in place. If you didn't, you would have to start labelling everything as terrorism. You would need to label all fights at protests as terrorism etc. 

Sometimes it is best not to define something as terrorism as it becomes easier to bring charges. This is why many people who are arrested (at least in the UK) in the middle of doing something are not charged with terrorism, they are charged with other offences e.g. murder, intent to kill etc. </TEXT>

That makes them peaceful protestors.

I can easily email somebody samples when they ask. About 4 people in 5 years have found me through my website. 

I don't have time to keep my site up to date, so I keep it 'empty' and get people to email me instead.

I could be throwing away work, I don't know. However, my days seem to be very full. I feel a website kept 'out of date' would do more harm than good to me.  </TEXT>
