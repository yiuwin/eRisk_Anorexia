	<TEXT> I think about the random dreams I have of people that I don't know well, or someone I met once. So naturally, I'd wouldn't tell them about it. If only they knew the weird dreams that I have featuring them. Makes me wonder if I've been in a dream of someone else that barely knows me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, i find it a bit misleading. The star rating isn't just a general health rating, it rates it between other items that are similar to it and fall into one of the 6 categories they have set up. So milo will be rated "healthier" than other chocolate flavor mixes like Cadbury or nesquik.

	<TEXT> I can give you perspective as a partner who is with someone who is a widow.

My girlfriend had a girlfriend who died 3 years ago (she was 24, died suddenly after being hit by a car). We've been together for about a year and a half. She is always conscious about how I feel about it. Honestly, I love hearing about her late partner. She gets upset now and then when things remind her of her late partner, but I never want her to hold the feelings inside, or feel like she needs to hide her love for her. I've accepted that she will always love her, and that's ok. My partner has PTSD from the accident, so everyday is a challenge, but I will always support her, no matter what. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mainly notice it in the rnb/rap/hip-hop genre but also in pop music. I understand, to an extent, if they're singing out the producers name because most people won't know that, but why their own name? Is there a purpose to this?

Edit: Some examples are Jason Derulo, Lady Gaga, Akon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On Fridays, my team at the office goes out to lunch. I usually bring in food from home so I can control what I'm eating, but I make an exception on Friday. I still try order the healthiest thing on the menu, but usually it'll be something a little bit higher in calories than what I'd normally eat. So that's my "cheat" for the week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try putting your details into a tdee (total daily energy expenditure) at https://mytdee.com

It should tell you how many calories to lose weight, to maintain etc and what goal you want (lose fat, gain muscle). This is how I started with my weight loss journey. Worked out what number I needed to eat under to lose weight and used my fitness pal to make sure I stayed under it by logging my food. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are some really cool sites that deliver fresh meals (depending where you are). Its really good if you're really really tempted at the supermarket. Do this for a few weeks if you can. Then start learning how to create these meals on your own. Online order your groceries so you're not tempted yet. I only go to the supermarket if I'm desperate and I try and get in an hour. I hate how they have designed the shops so you have to go through heaps of crap food to get a few things. </TEXT>
