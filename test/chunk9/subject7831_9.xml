	<TEXT> Would you praise someone for losing a bunch of weight even though it was stupid of them to over eat and get fat in the first place?
Same thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See that's the thing. It does bother me when people do associate it with stoner culture. Like it or not, for the less educated it is a part of "stoner culture" to an extent because there are the people who don't understand what it actually is so they turn it into something just about weed. Which I agree is bullshit. But you can't erase the fact that it has worked it's way into being a part of that culture through lack of knowledge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really bothers me when people buy clothes or accessories or whatever that have marijuana leaves on them. If I lived in Colorado or Washington or something, it wouldn't bug me. But thing is, I live somewhere that I know people still getting felonies for it's possession. It drives me nuts when my friends where stuff like that. I feel like it's just asking for trouble with cops. Like.. you're instantly singled out as someone to watch. Just irritates me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having a rough day. Last night sucked. I FINALLY got some sleep and had horrible nightmares again. At about 4am I texted my dealer to see if I could come pick up. He didn't respond until this morning. By then I was talking a bit with someone and had some things to do for distraction. Didn't ever text him back. Still going on day 6 today. Really dragging my feet about getting ready for work. Just not looking forward to getting bitched at all day. Struggling. I don't know. Things are just rough. I get to take my dog to the groomers tomorrow. Which I know is a stupid thing to be excited about. But I've had him since sophomore year of high school. He's the fucking shit. I love the hell out of him. But the apartment I'm at won't let me keep him here so he lives with my parents until my contract is up. It's stupid and silly I know. But I miss him like crazy. I'm super excited to get to see him for a while tomorrow. I have some big things happening right now that are kind of getting me down. So I'm trying to hold on to stupid little things like being able to hang out with my dog. Hope everyone is staying strong and feeling the love.


EDIT: Side note: Now that I'm at least trying to stay off everything, I actually have a little money to take my puppy to the groomers. That feels good. It's the little things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah!! I loved that one!! The picture doesn't even do it justice. It was when my friend who does my hair was still in school so it didn't come out quite like we were planning. It ended up being full on hot pink. But I freaking loved it. It was a super good summer color. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Thinking of getting a cover-up tattoo. Any advice? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> When I was younger I struggled with cutting and self harm for a few years. As a result I have some pretty gnarly scars on my thigh. Quite a few actually. Like.. close to a hundred that just haven't faded or anything yet. I don't mind them really. I'm not proud of them or what they came from. But it's a part of my past and I accept that. But I can't go a single day wearing shorts that I don't get asked about them. Random strangers will come up and ask me what happened. It gets a little old after a while. I'm very seriously considering getting a tattoo to do a little bit of cover up. Just wondering if anyone has had any success with that sort of thing. Does the ink hold differently over scars or anything like that? Any thoughts or advice? Thanks!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never thought about it that bluntly before. That scares me to death. I read that and just kind of broke down. I'm so scared. I shouldn't have be this afraid for my own personal safety. I'm not even 19 yet.  It's so fucked up that I let my life get to this point. I know I'm being awful and pathetic right now. Fuckin whiney bitch. ha. But.. I just can't keep living like this. I'm scared all the time. But I don't know what to do. I feel myself starting to panic even just thinking about him. I don't know if I'm more scared of what he'll do to me if I keep letting this happen or of what he'll do to me if I actually go through with pressing charges. Even just what's happened since I very first went and filed a police report and started finding out what I'd have to do to get  a restraining order has me ready to drop everything. I know I sound like a stupid dumbass girl, broken record. And I know it's stupid. I just don't know what's going to happen and scares me so badly. I don't know why that hit me so hard. Sorry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really worried about pressing charges. I don't really understand fully everything that it would entail. Trying to get a restraining order has proven to be more of a pain in the ass than I was expecting.  I just worry about what he'd do when he found out I was pressing charges.. Maybe that's stupid and pathetic of me. But I'm terrified of him and what he would do to me. And like.. I don't want to be the bitch that ruins everything for him by doing that. I worry about whether or not word would get out that I was pressing charges. I live in a super small town. I don't really want the whole world knowing ya know? I'm embarrassed by it. I'm embarrassed I let it happen. And then another part of me really worries no one would believe me anyway. I don't know. It's just more complicated that I care for. I feel like I'm not equipped to deal with it right now. But I know I have to figure SOMETHING out or things will just get worse. I just don't know how or what yet. Thank you for replying. It helps me a lot. Much love. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been to a few NA meetings but I've never really had the guts to actually say anything while I'm there. It just scares me. And embarrasses me. I just can't get over the fact that I KNOW people have been through worse than I have and probably handled it much better. I don't want to be that whiney bitch complaining about everything you  know? I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing with him when it comes to the police and shit. I filed an incident report the last time he left bruises about 2 weeks ago. So that's on record if I decide to press charges. I'm working on a restraining order right now. I don't know i I could handle pressing charges. I don't know if I could do all that drama. And I really don't want to be the bitch that ruins his life by pinning him with rape charges or something ya know? But thank you so much for responding. It means a lot to me and helps a ton to know there are people out there who aren't total assholes and want to help me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know there's a shelter/abuse prevention agency in my area. I just like... I don't know. I have reservations about contacting them. I don't know what I'd say or do or what they'd want me to say or do. And then there's like this voice in my head telling me I don't need to and it would be stupid of me to contact them because there are so many people who've been in worse situations that need their help. I don't know. It just makes me nervous. And I live in a really small town. I'm nervous about word getting out if I go there. Which I guess is kind of stupid. It's not like it's a big secret that he roughed me up. He'd do it at school sometimes when we were in high school. I'm sure people knew. I wasn't as good as making up lies about bruises and shit as I thought I was I'm sure. But no one ever said anything to me or him or anyone else about it. I'm a little embarrassed to tell people it happened and went to the extent it did. I'm embarrassed that I let it happen. I worry people will think  less of me. Or just tell me it's no big deal. Or not believe me. I don't know if I could handle any of those things.

I really struggle asking for help sometimes. It's just not the way I was brought up. We were kind of taught in my house that any struggles or whatever needed to be handled behind closed doors. People didn't need to be involved in our lives. My mom had cancer when I was younger and I remember her telling people she was just fine and declining offers to help with meals or help out with me and my 5 siblings. I knew we kind of needed the help with her in the hospital all the time. But we were taught that you just kind of have to toughen up and face what life throws at you without bringing anyone else down. I worry about that. I don't want to hurt anyone or bother them by telling them I'm struggling. But I don't know. I just feel like I've hit a brick wall. I'm not even 19. I'm young. I know that. I know I have so much time to figure shit out. But I just don't feel like I know how to do it right now. I just feel really stuck and really scared. I'm so scared all the time. I don't even know what of half the time. I'm realizing no matter how hard I try, I might not be able to work through everything by myself. I just don't know how to go about asking for the help I need.

Thank you so much for you support. I really, really appreciate it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know I've been so shitty about this whole recovery thing. I'm on board, then I drop off, then I'm back on, etc. But even with some extended absences everyone on this sub has been so supportive and I appreciate that more than you'll ever know.

I'm having a really rough time right now. I have a lot of things going on. I'm trying to open up about some things and work through some shit. I'm just really struggling and feeling really alone and weak. I hate that I feel like I can't take care of myself and do everything all on my own. But I don't feel like I can right now. This was the only place I could think where I wouldn't be made fun of for breaking down and asking for help.

Thanks for being awesome. Keep your heads up. Much love.

	<TEXT> I'm really, really scared. Every time I see him I just feel like a little kid again. I'm almost 19 (not that that's old. I know I'm young.) but he makes me feel like that 15 year old girl who was getting her ass kicked every other day. All I want to do is make a call and get enough to just numb this out and make it all go away. I don't know if I can actually go through with any legal shit against him because it means I'd have to actually talk about it and think about it and face it head on. I don't know if I'm strong enough to do that. Especially sober. </TEXT>
