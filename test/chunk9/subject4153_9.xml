	<TEXT> That's a fair criticism, though it's not the type of more illustration that demands a strong, clear light source and really suffers by having a more diffused, bounced, "everything is getting about the same amount of light" look. But, it also wouldn't be a bad thing if the light direction was more apparent and readable, that's something worth keeping in mind and striving for. 

Ha, looking at it again for the reply, just so darn cute and entertaining. I've always loved dense drawings like this with lots of details you catching when you come back. This would be such a good style for a children's book or a "Where's Waldo"-type scan and find book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really think that's the definition, and certainly not the definition in the usual sense of the word rhyming. I think most people would expect a multisyllabic word to be rhymed with on all syllables, not just the last. or at least much closer on each syllable. I'm not a lyricist, so I don't know if slant rhyme is quite the right term to bring up, but the "pur-" part in purple needs to be approximated a lot more than it would be with multi-, princi-, or tri-. All of these vowel sounds are in complete opposition to the sound pur- makes. 

Using your very loose criteria, you could also say that elevator rhymes with router or water prosecutor.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should be very proud, I think it's wonderful! The  illustration alone is great and charming as hell without any color, but the colors are so vibrant and well applied. The pipes feel round, I really like the shadows in the water. Everything feels like it's "in place", which is something I've struggled with while learning, giving things weight and form and having the appearance of resting on  other elements. </TEXT>

Instead you could interchange almost all of these episodes with any other at any point in the show's timeline. I thought this was a chance finally for them to disregard their own rules and some genuine changes could happen and add some finality to the show. I was excited when it looked like Alice might actually leave her job in "Bianca Toro"..but nah, status quo by the end.

	<TEXT> Very welcome, it was a quick, fun project. For these types of silhouette images, it's pretty simple. I use Photoshop, but it's something that could easily be done in a free program like [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) or [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/). Open the original, low-res image in the program, resize to what you want your final image to be...or even bigger, doesn't hurt to go really big and then shrink down if needed when you're done...and then you trace over the low-res image on a new layer. 

I like using the Pen tool in Photoshop as it creates a vector shape which can be continuously adjusted and stretched and resized without becoming pixelated or distorted. But if you aren't familiar with creating vector shapes, as long as you're working on a big canvas, you could just as easily use the regular ol' Brush tool and paint over low-res image. Either route, it's just a little patience and paying attention to details...in the end the image will turn out just as well. 

So now you have the real world equivalent of a painted white silhouette on a transparency. Add another layer underneath of this to create the red background. And then another on top of the red and below the silhouette to create the blood splatter or whatever other texture you might want. I have a bunch of blood splatter and grunge brushes in Photoshop that kinda behave like stamps, so I can just pop down a bunch of splatter effects with dark red or black and then erase a bit or adjust the layer transparency until it looks how i want.

I don't know how familiar you are with creating graphics in general so this might be overkill or still vague, but it's a starting point. The gist is just to trace it in a graphics program on a separate layer after resizing it to a much larger canvas. You can look up tutorials on using the Pen tool or finding grungy brushes to get deeper into recreating it the exact way I did. Hope that helps some! </TEXT>

Snap a picture of your empty "set" without any figures, the setup your figures without moving the camera or changing your lights. When you're editing you can put the clean plate on the base layer and your staged photos on a higher layer. Then you can literally erase the stands and anything else from your top layers and reveal the empty background on the layer below.

If you're careful about watching out for shadows and making sure the stands are positioned in the best places, the work should be very quick and easy. </TEXT>

I may even go back and try to see how much I can add to it in that respect. I think there's the opportunity for a few more details on what's already dried, even with my cheap, stubborn paper.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hopefully that all made sense. It's like you're making a pebbled, abstract texture that works well with watercolor...interesting, organic-looking, diffused shapes that sometimes blend gradually with their neighbors and sometimes keep harder edges. And that pattern just happens to look a whole lot like a hamburger patty.

This is on 4x6" paper, the burger by itself is about 4" tall.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks very much!

The patty is one of those things I find pretty easy to make taking advantage of watercolor's natural characteristics. It's a lighter brown wash first and then lots of dabbing with dark brown and black. Sometimes wet on wet, but at least always with a very wet brush so the paint spots had lots of water to disperse in and help create the texture. Continue this with more and more black in the right places to help create the look of contours and shadows. It's probably like...five or six passes of adding texture like this, drying in between. After I'm pretty happy with the texture and it looks like it has form, I'll do a couple really light washes of orange or red to "revive" it a bit, all the speckling(at least how I do it) usually makes it a little dull and gray. Finally, the lighter spots on the left side of the burger or highlights made with a gel pen and then painted over lightly with brown to kill the white some and blend the gel where I don't want a bright, tight edged dot.

For the bun, I actually just painted around the highlights. I'm using really cheap paper and it doesn't blot or scrub very well at all so it was safer to do this. They're big enough and soft edged enough that it wasn't too much of a challenge to do it like this. Painted yellow/brown wash down first. Blended the highlights a little with just a wet brush. Added a really wet, darker brown wash on the right and blend it out towards the left. Worked on adding the texture along the bottom of the bun with some lighter brown. Once I was pretty happy with the shading, I added a couple of light washes of bright yellow, like the same pigment used for the cheese, over the whole bun-highlights and all-to make it look hot and buttery.

It probably **would** be a lot easier and smoother looking to do the being mostly in one go with wet on wet and pick up the highlights with paper towel. I've decided to paint a burger a month as a kinda benchmark for myself...I'll have to try that method on next month's. </TEXT>

[Overall, I thought the ending...](#s "covered what it needed to, just with more mundane, less flashy/sinister/supernatural machinations. Lisa's grief turned into a kind of mental illness and that can kinda, maybe in a "too convenient" way, brush away some plot holes and weirdness. My biggest pet peeve was how the people who visited her became near instant converts and started acting differently. Because they seemed to act so suddenly odd only for the sake of the novel's mystery, when really nothing happened to them and they didn't have a reason to be so strange around friends or coworkers. They had no reason not to explain everything.")

	<TEXT> I just read both books in the last week and that might be for the best. I liked both books, but they certainly are a bit different than a lot of fiction, they're more like accounts of real, obscure stories in that they meander and frustrate and don't tie things up neatly like you often expect fiction to. Real life is mysterious and unknowable and unsatisfying enough, you kinda want a made-up story to provide you with some closure.

Wolf in White Van is definitely even more ultimately about the characters and not the plot. There were multiple threads that opened up that I thought the story was going to go down only for it to really go down none at all. So if Harvester frustrated you with that lack of a strong, traditional plot to travel down...Wolf will almost certainly make you pull your hair out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple weeks ago, I made a [shadow box paper cutout project like this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/38/23/f1/3823f13761932f411eb4692da01e1378.jpg) and I looked into the paper cutters afterwards thinking about how easier it would've been and how much more detailed the images could've been if I didn't have to do it by hand.

I also like to make boardgame inserts out of 2mm presentation board and wondered if these might be able to help with that as well. I really enjoy designing the inserts but the execution can get tedious and sometimes frustrating. Again, not being limited to what I can do by hand would really open up a lot of possibilities for useful inserts. But in my bit of research, I think 2mm might be pushing the limits of any consumer machine in this tier.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, Same Old Kid was such a great example of consciously crafting a slightly new sound and voice. And it hits a perfect tone of a little more serious during the name transition but still staying funny. Froggy Fresh in general has a slightly different vibe than Krispy Kreme to me without becoming a wholly new character, and that's impressive. 

I'm personally not a huge rap fan and love the mix of music and comedy Tyler crafted, so I'm a bit biased. I wouldn't be terribly interested in a serious effort, but if he wanted to he certainly has the chops.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess...but everyone pretty much discovered Tyler Cassidy by investigating further into Krispy Kreme, not the other way around. Something about Krispy caught on with more people in less time. He tried the serious rap game and ultimately clearly had more fun and success discovering the comedic side of things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Zero shade intended. I'm very impressed by the collection and the display, I wish there was an album so we could see close-ups and identify exactly who all is in there. 

I have no doubt there are collectors with more, and I have no doubt none have ever described their collection as humble. The only reason anyone is giving you quasi-grief is because in an instance where no adjectives would've sufficed, you used the most exact opposite you could've and it comes off pretty humorous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the point is, it's something these companies that have done a hundred projects should need to expect...and yet still don't. It's mind-boggling.

And for your second point, they absolutely do not need to rely on Kickstarter. Some boardgame companies, and many others I'm sure, have helped created this perception where we should believe that no product can ever be created they were for decades and decades...you know, where a company used investors and in-house money and had to take risks to produce items and hope to eventually turn a profit. Nowadays, why ever bother doing this when you have thousands of people storming your gates to give you a million dollars in interest-free loans, like it was a privilege to do so. 

Don't get me wrong, I still Kickstart games, but it has to be a more special package from a smaller company or individual better fits the spirit of Kickstarter. These million dollar projects that fund in an hour from companies taking advantage of the system just seem gross to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My watercolor lessons are usually YouTube videos, and one of my favorite channels is Steve Mitchell's Mind of Watercolor. He has spent a few videos painting various birds in one of his journals and I really liked that idea of creating a themed journal. But before I steal that idea and potentially ruin a $20+ book, I'm practicing on single pages in my $2 Hobby Lobby books.

I'm still trying to find a balance between the pen work and the watercolor. I'm more confident drawing so right now I'm usually happier with these "coloring book" type approaches, but I don't want to be so that if you could lift away the ink lines you would just see dull, flat patches of color. I don't want the ink to do all the detail and value work. I like this level of pen detail fairly well, not a whole lot of hatching serving as a substitute for watercolor shading. </TEXT>

It's pretty fun once you get through the pain and you can almost predict what the watercolor might want to do half the time! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is incredible. As someone at any level, it's  stunning...but especially as a beginner, it's mind-boggling to look at this and try to imagine the work process to get such great results. The level of detail and vividness is wonderful, but it's not too sterile or overworked and still has the texture and tell-tale watercolor qualities you wouldn't want to obscure entirely. </TEXT>

I currently have mine set-up in kinda "alternate universe" poses...Venus with her arms in tact, David dynamically swinging the sling.
