	<TEXT> This is what I hate so much. The "all things wrong with white males" articles and just the society norm of making fun of guys penis sizes or height. And even when they brag about rejecting guys. Most of the time its girls that do that and they have 0 context for it from a guys point of view and would flip their shit if a guy made fun of even their weight(which is something they can actually change). This modern society has taught people to hate on white males and love every minority/female. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say a big part of it is that our modern society teaches/expects males to suppress their negative/sad feelings. Guys are told to "be strong" and not cry or talk to people about emotions. Its something I'd love to see change. I see girl crying in public and three dudes run over to her asking what's wrong and asking if she's okay, they have someone there to help them. A guy does the same thing and he gets weird looks and uncomfortable responses.Most of the time guys are expected to be rocks emotionally and this leads to guys letting the sadness/negativity overtake them and have no outlet for it all other than suicide.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're fairly common actually. Hundreds of people commit suicide every day and their bodies end up everywhere. You normally just don't hear about it because its usually some middle class white male. There's no implication in that though so nobody is going to care.

So only bits and pieces of it are legitimate? or It's only legit when its used to push one side of the story? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> of course this was left out of the quote above you but this part of the NYT article seems to imply that there was no foul play at all.

 The police were investigating how she ended up in the river, and it was not clear how long Judge Abdus-Salaam, who lived nearby in Harlem, had been missing. There were no signs of trauma on her body, the police said. She was fully clothed.

 A law enforcement official said investigators had found no signs of criminality. Her husband identified her body. </TEXT>

The fact that this is being instantly equated to a hate crime because of her race is unsettling.

	<TITLE> Former Blink-182 singer/guitarist Tom Delonge to help government release info about UFO's and extra terrestrial lifeforms we have encountered. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-27 11:29:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Tom Delonge has been talking about releasing information regarding our governments contact with extra terrestrial life and cover ups with their approval/permission as private companies are now going into space so NASA will not be able to control what these private companies see in space. This apparently has helped urge the government to put a plan in place to start informing the population on what has been going on with the help of delonge because he will be making movies (not the one he is directing right now) to help reach the widest audience with information. $100 million budget movies with international releases.

This all seemed like a lot of talk but in the recent Wikileaks dump there was proof that podesta and delonge were talking about their "sensitive subject". http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/read-tom-delonges-leaked-e-mail-to-hillary-clinton-about-ufos-w444283 This confirms that delonge isn't making stuff up.

	<TEXT> I think its okay to have a preference. Like not wanting to date black women or not wanting to date a short guy. But there is a point where it turns into discrimination. When you're talking to someone who is out of your preference but is a perfect 10/10 minus that one preference but you just refuse to date them because of that one preference. I feel like at that point its just discrimination and saying "I have a preference" is the way to get out of discriminating someone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly kinda always felt the same what when I watched him. I've watched him on three different occasions and have gotten a very "meh" reaction out of his performances. Nothing too great. Average looking to me. He seems to be hyped up as the next best American keeper though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Putting your knee down before you pick up a rolling ball is a very very basic goalkeeping skill. Not something you'd expect a National team quality keeper to have a lapse on. I know its a mistake and it happens to everyone but that's a very big mistake. I've honestly always thought he's looked pretty average when I've watched him but I guess everybody else thinks otherwise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just because McMath was dominant with a good defense in front of him doenst make him a better goalkeeper. He also didn't get a full mls season in so I find him hard to compare anyways. I would certainly not say Irwin is better. Even everyone on the mls subreddit agree that frei is overrated. He makes one great save in the mls cup and suddenly he is the best of the best. Bendik lost his job to konopka because he had a rough time coming back from an injury with TFC and ultimately got in a bad mind set and needed a change of scenery. Look at how good he did in TFC before all of that went down. One effy season doesnt automatic negate all his previous accolades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. Theyve taken away pretty much all the main features and gamemodes from the game. There was an entire story mode that they got rid of. It was like a full fledged game that just needed multiplayer. Now its a completely empty game and most of the online maps are boring versions of the old maps. They still dont even have all the maps ported and its been almost 10 months. They havnt put most of the stuff back in and I have yet to hear anything about the soccer gamemode that they showcased at E3. At this point im convinced they just took our money and ran. They need to hand this off to new devs. These current devs have no sort of timeline or respect to their own set release dates. They were supposed to have a complete game by the end of 2016(their own word) and now almost three months in to the next year and we havnt heard anything. What a fucking disaster. </TEXT>

Maybe you should stop cherry picking things to read that confirm your bias.

	<TEXT> Even if all of this comes out to be 100% true, it is no where near "the biggest breaking story this decade." All this proves is that Trumps administration talked to another country's Intel officials.....that's not illegal. If the contents of these calls come out to be highly illegal than that's a different story but I don't think you can call Trump talking to a country's Intel officials a massive ground breaking thing on its own. I think this just might be fueling some confirmation bias you have about Trump. </TEXT>
