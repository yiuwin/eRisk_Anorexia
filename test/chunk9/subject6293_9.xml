	<TEXT> There will be a second button. 


Only those who pressed the first button (excluding the filthy purples of course) will get a chance to press again. 


Participants will then receive two flairs, further dividing the factions. A third button will appear, forbidding purple2s from pressing, and so on, until it is just a battle among the elite. From there, a winner shall be crowned.

	<TEXT> I saw this forest this spring at my city's bonsai society's showcase. I talked to the women who this belongs to. This specific forest was once part of a much larger group of bonsai trees, but the owner abandoned the forest. They worked really hard to rescue it, and their efforts paid off. This forest does take massive amounts of maintenance, but the way she described it made it seem therapeutic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know some roms allow you to decrease the transition speed down to 0.25x. I prefer to have mine off completely. 

Since you switch apps a lot I would recommend adding the "[last app](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1fpuc7/the_killer_feature_of_aokp_for_me_that_nobody/)" button to your navigation bar. It's incredibly convenient. I don't think there are xposed modules for that though. 

If you choose to try a rom I would recommend Slim Rom. </TEXT>
