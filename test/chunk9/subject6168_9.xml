	<TEXT> You can definitely go head to head with a giant. If you see their giant appear behind on their side, prep your golem, his slower deploy and speed will cause the fight to happen on your side. Murder the giant with your golem support troops while your golem tanks theirs. Your golem will out last their giant and depending how fast you kill the giant you'll have a massive golem (or golemite) supported push. This works best with inferno dragon, but a LJ, mini p, any fast giant slayer will work. Try skarmy, they can't all be zapped if you surround a giant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much for this write up. I was using another quick cycle mortar deck last week, it had a decent win rate but your deck is much more fun thanks to the miner. It gives it a little more flexibility and the opportunity to catch someone off guard on a counter. I also had to finish someone off with log miner chip twice lol

How critical is the level 2 miner? My rocket is level 9, would you recommend that over a level 1 miner for ladder play? So far I've dominated 2 tournaments with miner.

I'd love to see high ladder replays! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't build a deck around log. You sub it in for something and benefit from good elixir trades. For example in my 3M deck it's my only spell. I was using fireball, but subbed it out for log and I don't miss FB at all. I use ice wizard, fire spirits and 3M to handle anything in the air.

Another deck would be a hog rocket log combo, that again has maybe fire spirits, ice spirit or ice wiz to handle air, specifically minion horde. Try it out and see what works and what doesn't. It's biggest downfall is the inability to handle minion hordes, but the utility it brings over zap is amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats on your achievement. What are your thoughts on replacing skeletons with either stabby gobs or log? I'm huge fan of log and its many users. I feel like it could do well. It seems like the skeletons primary function is to just be a cheap cycle. Also my stabby gobs are 11 while skeletons are level 8. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they should just allow xbow to attack air and reduce its air range like in CoC. Leave the ground interaction the same. This would also give hound decks the ability to counter xbow siege by tanking the shots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And vice versa x bow will be at the mercy of air decks since they're probably going to become very popular. I think all it needs is the ability at attack air but at a shortened range. Similar to how it works in CoC </TEXT>
