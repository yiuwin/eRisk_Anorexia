	<TEXT> Yeah no problem! Let's see, when I tried sublingual it was my first time messing with Hbwr and I heard about how bad the stomach cramps/nasusa was suppose to be so I tried my hardest not to swallow anything at all. 

The second time I tried it I decided to just flat out chew and swallow 3 seeds. The nasusa/stomach discomfort came way before any of the effects (took 2 hours to get visuals) and it was pretty annoying at just 3 seeds. I didn't need to puke persay, but it didn't feel good at all and subtracted from the experience. 

Now the third time I did it, I look online and saw that people use that over the counter nasusa medicine (dramamine) 30ish mins before taking the seeds to reduce the nasusa. So I tried it and it definitely works. I still felt a little discomfort but it wasnt distracting from the experience at all. 

So I recommend taking some with some dramamine to help with the nausea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It could work. I've tried sublingual (crushed them up with a hammer and put the crushed up seed under my tongue for like 20mins then spit them out) and I still felt effects, though they weren't as strong as just eating them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man I can't trip with sober people anymore. Besides tripping with another friend that's also tripping is so much better. It's like you are communicating telepathicly with them. 

We could be looking off into space just thinking about something and we would both realize afterwards that we were thinking about the same thing. It's weird but sooo awesome and you can't have that experience with sober people. You just 'get' each other when your duo tripping. Never tripped with 3 or more though. Would like to, only with really close friends.  </TEXT>
