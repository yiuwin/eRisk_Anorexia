	<TEXT> The Spanish Armada. Everybody should have answered with this. 

Worthy of note, but not really mentioned very often (at least, I only recently learned about it, and I've read about the Armada more times than I can count since I was a young child), is that the English developed an Armada of their own to go after Spain, shortly after the 1588 Spanish Armada, and was devastated largely as a result of stormy conditions.

	<TEXT> I would have to go with Gaius Marius and his reforms, perhaps also Sulla. The Roman Republic lost a couple major battles against the Germans, almost totally annihilating the army, but then Marius came along and reformed the way the Roman military operated and ended up winning great battles against even greater odds.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue.

Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks under Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453. That is, roughly 40 years prior to the discovery of the New World. 

Watch your arithmetic, sonny. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sir Thomas North was a contemporary of William Shakespeare and was a translator of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, which is generally said to have been the primary source for the play Julius Caesar, performed in 1599. One year later, the more renowned Philemon Holland published his translation of Plutarch. 

Rome was the heart of the Catholic Church, so it was a well-known location, but I would be surprised if there were more than a handful of people in the original audiences who could spot the mistakes or deviations Shakespeare opted to make in his play. The lower classes were traditionally a few generations behind the upper classes in the 1800s when it came to literary developments and such stuff, so throwing the clock back to the year 1600, it seems likely that the peasants would not be very informed about a topic which had just really opened up to the most informed during the Renaissance. Indeed, most families were illiterate and, in the 1700s, if they owned any book, it was the Bible. Considering that this was prior to the King James translation of the Bible, wherein Rome is mentioned frequently in the New Testament, it seems unlikely that they would have known much about Rome at all. The Clergy, on the other hand, should (but indeed probably didn't always) have known at least as much about Rome as the Bible reveals.

Talking about the theme resonating with the people, you should consider reading Caesar and Cleopatra by George Bernard Shaw. His plays very often were directly analogous to contemporary events, designed specifically to resonate with the audience. It is worth noting, as well, that Shaw considered Shakespeare's Julius Caesar to be abysmal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Moral of the story: don't go around with massive quantities of drugs, no matter their legal status, in your pockets :P

The 2C-B is iffy; I know it is illegal here in Canada. If nothing in your possession is technically illegal, I can't imagine them being able to take it to trial. Just keep insisting that you broke no laws; or, better yet, ask them to state which law you broke. Habeas corpus, mate. </TEXT>
