	<TEXT> My grandpa had alzheimer's and ultimately ended up passing away from it. He was always joking around and was pretty foul mouthed. He moved in with my parents so they could take care of him for about a year before his death. We were pretty close and I remember about 5 months before he died, I walked in to the kitchen to see him putting his shoes in the microwave, I said grandpa... what are you doing? He looked at me and with a complete stone cold face said "nothing what the fuck are you doing." I couldn't help but laugh and at his funeral I randomly thought of that moment and started laughing really hard in front of my whole family, not only that but I couldn't stop laughing. Everyone was staring at me, but I know that my grandpa would have been laughing with me if he could have. </TEXT>
