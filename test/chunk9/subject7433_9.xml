	<TEXT> When I was about 9 I was coming home from school, and when we got home we saw an undressed package sitting in our mailbox. So Dad decided to open the package, and inside were drugs. LOTS of drugs. So we rushed to the car (putting the package in center console of the car (so that my siblings (7 5 at the time) wouldn't touch/play with them) and drove to the police station. We explained to the officers at the station that we came home and found these in the mailbox and they took them away for testing. 

Scary thing was this took place in a family neighborhood in Australia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey,


I am a 15 year old from Australia and I have two weeks of school holidays coming up, and I want to dedicate that time to learning Japanese.

So I was wondering what you would reccomend I learn in that time, from knowing zero Japanese?


Thanks


-Joshua

	<TEXT> I hate when people on the train talk about a certain topic on the phone like they know everything. For example: I was on the train from Box Hill a few weeks back and there was a girl in here late teens/early twenties and she was on the phone talking about Testra (Australian phone company) and she was saying something about people going over there data limits on their phones and she was saying that you get a text asking if you want to buy extra data, which is completely false. What happens is you automatically get charged $10 for an extra gig of data. Ugggggh she was so annoying.

Sorry for ranting :( </TEXT>
