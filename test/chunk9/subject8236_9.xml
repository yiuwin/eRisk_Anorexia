	<TEXT> Just booked couple of days back tickets for my Dad. Tried the senior citizen thing. No tickets were available. So, had to do normal booking. I guess they have a very limited seats for it and dont give discount to any or every sr. citizen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Breakfast, just get cereal and buy milk. I don't think anyone ever gets bored of it + there's enough variety in the market that you could do this for weeks/months. Get oats otherwise. It's cheaper and healthier alternative. Along with fruits. How do you eat 1 burger for lunch? I'd be all hungry and cranky throughout the day. If you are getting a burger, try n check if you have subway around. Healthier alternative and is also similarly priced (sub of the day). You can ask them to fill it up with veggies if you like. Make dal or sambar or just some gravy for dinner with roti. If you can't make roti, just get ready to eat ones. If you look around, I'm sure you'll find some resto that does home delivery fee of cost or minimal price. That seems to be cheaper option than swiggy n stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd take irritating heat to sweaty heat any day. As long as I've got a bottle of water with me while I'm out. I'm in Chennai right now. I don't even have to move to start sweating. Heat + humidity is crazy in the afternoon. If I'm out for work in the afternoon, by the time I reach the destination it looks like I took a shower with cloths on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We will be the pioneers in it. Other countries can follow if they want to.  Let's play national anthem in the middle of the road and if ppl don't stop their vehicle and stand up, I'll report them to police. I'll do it especially when a minister is around. Play national anthem 24x7 on a loud speaker when a judge or minister is around. Let's see how long they stand.  </TEXT>
