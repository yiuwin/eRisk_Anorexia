	<TEXT> That is kinda the same situation I was in. Only it hurt me really badly. I let them be together, didn't tell her anything. They were on and off together for 2 years, now they split up. I used this to tell her what I feel. It felt so good to get out all of my thoughts. It was a relief. I still love her and would do anything for her. I would suggest you to tell her what you feel when you get a good chanse, it might turn up good for ya. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Human emotions are bitch man. I can clearly see how you feel, I have basicly the same problem, only I can never get to even kiss the girl i want so badly. One thing that i learned from this is that you should not let yourself roll deeply in that feeling, you should crawl your way out of it. And this is hypocrite of me as I'm constantly doing the opposite.

*I don't know how to spell hipocryte. And maybe few other words... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to get her out of my head, but I just can't. The problem is that we always had something weirdly special thing between us, we both like eachother more than friends do. I just couldn't hold it in any more and I told her everything from my heart. She just came out from a long relationship and does not want any commitment. 

Thanks for replying! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well thanks! I mean, I'm new here and this is my first comment reply. I know it's not great and maybe off topic, but i felt the urge to write something while i had the inspiration and i didn't look over it too much. English is not my mother language so it should have some mistakes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As the days slowly wears off, I just as slow start to feel numb, the bruise in me starts to feel cold. I feel how heavy the thoughts are rushing in, on my weak shoulders i grow mold. I break myself every time her voice starts rushing in my head:

"They are so tiny mom! I let them play beneath my feet. They are like my children and i am the queen!"

Oh, how she loved the Sun! So she tried to pick up it's traces, and they came in thousand shapes and sizes all flashing so vividly before my eyes. I can't get them together, I can't go around them, I would just sit with her and watch as they turn to gold, as the golden giant fades behind a distant hill. All those marks she calls her children, her tiny heroes of setting star, they still remind me every evening how she loved the Sun. 

That was my daughter, the child of the Sun. </TEXT>
