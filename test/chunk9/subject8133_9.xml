	<TEXT> Hiya, thanks for message. I'm quite inexperience as far as legion dungeons go, I don't want to burden you with my woeful dps at the moment, but I'm keen if you have the patience :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! I play both Alliance and Horde. But I only have a max level Rogue on alliance at the moment who is only sitting at ilvl 830 and like I said I havent even done a normal dungeon yet :/ so I'm super inexperienced! My dps would probably be too low for your M+ group? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would love this, I still haven't seen the inside of any Legion dungeon or raid, due to toxic experiences in the past with pug groups and that has built up some anxiety. Anyone with anxiety knows that whatever it is that is causing the feeling, you tend to steer clear of it. Which sucks because I really want to see the content. Unfortunately I'm US-Caelestrasz so I gather this idea wont work for me?
Anyway my Battletag is  Parabol#1503 if any patient people out there want to group up for stuff!

	<TEXT> Something is shorting out, usually it's the atomizer but since you said you tried another one and are still getting the same error. Make sure all your connections are clean from the mod to the tank. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I vape in my man cave and my smoke detector is just outside the door in another room, it goes off if I chain vape. I went and bought a second fan for the room and that seems to clear the fog fairly quickly.
Also shower caps work.
Just remember to take it off when you're asleep or when you leave. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Going from mouth to lung  direct lung </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-27 02:51:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've always been a mouth to lunger. Recently I bought the Smok Alien mod with baby beast and upon doing so realised my days of mouth to lung were over. The airflow is just not tight enough.

I was comfortable at 6mg doing mouth to lung for years and noticed when changing to direct lung I had to drop my nic as it was a little harsh, so I went down to 3mg. Doing direct lung at first was not comfortable at all, I didnt like it. Then for 3 days I was nauseous and dizzy,really bad. Ive had nicotine buzz before but this was terrible, I thought I had a virus and it didnt even occur to me it was nic sickness because I'd already dropped my level. Anyway I'm on 1mg now and thats all I can handle. Pretty cool really. Ive been vaping 6 years next month and started on 18mg, wont be long till I'm 0mg. 

Anyway just a lesson for anyone going from MTL DL. Drop your nic at the same time. </TEXT>
