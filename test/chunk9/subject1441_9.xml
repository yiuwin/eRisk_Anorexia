	<TEXT> My anorexia was/ is comorbid with my OCD. Especially from a health OCD perspective. I became very concerned about nutrients and avoiding weight gain to minimize poor health effects. The ED was diagnosed and treated first. Putting some weight back on actually lessened the compulsions and anxiety around food. Pretty much weight restored now and some of the obsessions about food are still there but they really have gone down. I don't have to eat certain things in certain ways anymore. Currently, I'm working on my other health related anxieties. Feel free to message me if you want to talk/ have other questions. I'm pretty open.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came back from a trip where I allowed myself to enjoy things that scare me (bread, chocolate, etc). I could feel myself getting flabby. (This is probably just my brain but it's still disturbing). But now that I'm home, I'm having a hard time. I eat and I feel insanely guilty. It's unpleasant and also scary because if I were to relapse, I'm done. Fucking done. The recovery process is hard. 

So basically I don't know what to do. I had like 800 calories of chocolate today (not bingey, it was a fancy desert) and I feel like absolute shit. I want to download my fitness pal again to try to control myself. I want to stop taking my Prozac. Fuck. Why is this happening again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the reminder. I don't want to remember the trip where I maintained a perfect diet and exercise regime and a perfect body. I want to remember having fun with my family and seeing new places. 

I've thrown out all my scales so that won't be an issue luckily. And I made an appointment with my therapist Monday to help ensure that I transition back into the routine I had before the trip.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been eating so well. Trying things I've been scared of for over a year and trying to just generally enjoy the trip. It started out fine and I was able to handle it. Now I'm getting towards the end of the trip (2 weeks) and I can feel and see it collecting on my stomach. I don't like it at all. I can go through all the rational thought processes (it's not really noticeable, after starvation, regained weight goes to the stomach, etc). But at the end of the day, it still bothers me. I know rationally it's probably not much if any weight any ways because we've been active and moving the whole trip. 

Anyway, my problem is that my ED wants me to go back to restricting when I get home. But I can't. Because if I relapse, I think I'm done. Getting better to this point was the hardest thing I have ever done and I don't think I could do it again. 

I'm just frustrated. And tired of this shit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not what you want to hear, but I really don't think running that race is safe for you. I'm sure it's really disappointing I have put in all that time and effort to train, but now is not the time for a race for you. Eating disorders are diseases and they suck. I'm glad you are getting help at residential. There will be plenty of time for races afterwards when you are healthy and can enjoy it completely for the right reason. Seeing you run a race while so sick would hurt your family. 

No judgement, though, because I've totally been there. The exercise addiction part of my ED was the hardest to break.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone reacts and metabolizes different meds differently. I might suggest talking to psych again and getting it switched. I actually experienced the opposite when I started fluoxetine. It leveled out pretty quickly through to a happy normal so to speak. Given you've had 2 months with little improvement, you might want to look into switching on to a different med or changing the dose. My side effects were worse at lower doses and got better (and decreased symptoms) as I made my way up in dosage.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a touch of this too. Part of my OCD is being convinced I am actually a horrible person who secretly wants to hurt everyone and destroy lives. I'm constantly checking my emotions to make sure I'm feeling the right thing at the right time. And overcompensating to prove my good intentions. So what you are feeling is very much in line with OCD symptoms. And you're not alone!

Finding a good therapist has been helpful for me. Right now I'm working on thought desensitization so basically when I get a bad thought stuck in my mind, I'm supposed to say it outlays a bunch of times really fast/ in a weird voice because it makes the concept more abstract. It's less believable in a weird voice and out loud. The goal is that this will eventually translate to what goes on in my head. I feel ridiculous even though it's just me alone in my car doing this, but it honestly helps. At least in the moment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I for sure have days where it flares up. Usually it has to do with uncertainty and anxiety in another part of my life and my brain tries to control it with "making sure" I don't get develop chronic diseases like diabetes or heart disease or whatever (which is what my OCD is mostly about). I'm sure there are other things that trigger flare ups for me, but I'm still early in the process of learning how to handle my OCD, so it's still hard for me to say. Just wanted to let you know, that from my perspective anyway, it's really normal to have good days and bad days for symptoms.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man, the being pulled different directions sucks. I had to be treated for anorexia first because it's hard to make progress in ERP when underweight as it made me really mentally unstable. As far as trauma goes, I can't speak specifically since I don't have any real serious trauma, but some of my friends from treatment have had success doing both at the same time. They found that their OCD is to control the thoughts and feelings the trauma brings up. 

I'm sorry to hear you are having trouble finding a provider. That makes me so mad at this country. Ugh, the mental health insurance coverage in this country is deplorable. I've had luck with ERP just taking it one step at a time. It's a bitch to fight through and just feels overwhelming at times. I spent yesterday crying on my drive to over a fear of diabetes from bread, but it does eventually pass. Just know that and keep pushing. I'm super lucky in that I have an amazing mom, group of friends, and -most of all- therapist. 

If you ever need to talk, I'm always willing to listen.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I bore witness to the greatest petty revenge of my life at the major hospital pharmacy I work in. 

The pharmacy techs pull the drugs. The more advanced techs (called checkers) have to check the work to ensure patient safety. They make sure each pill is the called for dose and the packaging is intact with a good expiration date Their job is made easier when whole, intact sleeves or boxes are used for high volume drugs like Senna or Tylenol. 

One of the techs was pulling drugs. The bitchy checker kept going after her for not ordering the drugs in the specific way she desired. No other checker has this requirement. The tech got tired of being bitched at so when 200 Tylenol popped up, instead of pulling out 2 boxes, she found 200 loose Tylenol which forced the checker to scrutinize each individual pill. She stopped attacking the tech after that. 

EDIT: TL;DR-- supervisor was nit picky to the extreme, was forced to carefully examine 200 individual capsules of Tylenol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a nasty exercise compulsion. Honestly, what broke it for me was being physically prevented from exercising for a while. I was in IP for 8 days back in November and they didn't allow any exercise at all. While I was there, I met with a PT who specializes in exercise compulsions to come up with a safe exercise plan (mainly don't do cardio alone, stick to weight lifting until weight restored). 

If you have OCD with your Ed like I do, having a structured plan really helped. Because I enjoy working out and always have, but having a plan with planned days off really helps. And a day off doesn't have to mean lying around all day- you can still walk or toss a ball with friends or something.  </TEXT>
