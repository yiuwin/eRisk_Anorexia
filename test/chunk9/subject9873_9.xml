	<TEXT> Unfortunately, the vocals seem to be very quiet and overpowered in this track, so it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to isolate the vocals. I'd say the only way you'll get them is by finding the official studio acapella, and since that doesn't seem to be a very popular song finding it is unlikely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anybody have them? I know they likely exist somewhere as Quantic sampled the drums from Soul Thing in [Time Is the Enemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvUeo5sagkA) (they appear at around 0:22 in the video I linked) but he made that song in 2001, so if the stems were on the internet back then they're probably long gone. If anybody has them though, that would be great. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A better option if you're getting an engagement ring would be Moissanite. It sparkles more, and costs a fraction of the price.

An example of this would be this moissanite ring here which is $1,030 at its cheapest and $1,835 at its most expensive.

https://www.moissaniteco.com/round-forever-brilliant-split-shank-halo-engagement-ring-p-14940.html?action=add_product number_of_uploads=0 zenid=f8c65c228bb092ddeafc5c4876244b29

Now here's a similar diamond ring by Kay, which is damn near $10,000

http://www.kay.com/en/kaystore/r6-rings-101488--1/neil-lane-engagement-ring-1-3-8-ct-tw-oval-cut-14k-white-gold/101488/101488.101495



It's pretty obvious that the diamond ring is a scam and moissanite is better AND cheaper. </TEXT>
