The only way we actually march on the DMZ is if they bomb a country in a first strike and kill civilians or blow up a lot of stuff, then we have to convince China not to attack SK or the US or Japan, then we go into NK.

Yeah, exactly

you're talking about fictional bullshit.

The irony... the Federal Reserve and their ability to hold a nation's money supply over that nation's head, force inflation, printing less money, raise interest rates and subsequently the citizens' prime rates, mortgage rate, credit card, car loan, markets rate, messing with the stock market, and thinking that might force world leaders under that type of control into acting in a way the ones with the control want them to is not fiction, in fact it's not even a conspiracy.

Have you not noticed they've been running the exact same stories over and over again in different wording now because they ran dry on having anything to report about Trump Russia? They've been trying with all their might for 4 months to pin something on Trump and there's nothing. Look at all the technology we have with that new Wikileaks dump, everything Russia tries to do could be seen by the CIA from a mile away.

Also you called me out without actually having any counterpoint besides creating your own big conspiracy with even less of a foundation than the central banking control </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well have fun trying to find out, they don't actually tell you. Who runs the show is whoever sits on the Board of each of the banks that make up the 12 regional banks in the US. All that they'll list names of is the [Chairman and the Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/) they're just people on committees, housekeepers, not actually the people who sit on the board of all the banks that make it up who hold the influence

Here's a quote from the guy who signed the bill that created the Federal Reserve 

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7sr2DspCZig/maxresdefault.jpg

Look further into the Federal Reserve stuff if you want, it's quite interesting and not really tinfoil-ish because once you have a good feel for it it becomes pretty obvious what a garbage system it is.

Remember when we went into that random war with Iraq over "WMDs"
 
Between October 15, 2003 and January 15, 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority issued new Iraqi dinar coins and notes, with the notes printed using modern anti-forgery techniques, to create a single unified currency that is used throughout all of Iraq and will also make money more convenient to use in peoples everyday lives. Old banknotes were exchanged for new at a one-to-one rate, except for the Swiss dinars, which were exchanged at a rate of 150 new dinars for one Swiss dinar. The Central Bank of Iraq was established as Iraqs **independent** central bank by the Central Bank of Iraq Law of March 6, 2004.

Central banks are specifically designed to trap nations in debt spirals from which they can never possibly escape.  In 2015, the debt to GDP ratio for the entire planet was up to an all-time high record of 286 percent.  Humanity is being enslaved by a perpetual debt machine, but most people are not even aware that it is happening.

	<TEXT> Globalism is a completely logical and obvious endgame though when you have shit loads of money and run banks in multiple countries. If you're a ridiculously rich person with a bunch of ridiculously rich friends and you want to get even richer with much less trouble and unpredictable events to deal with, the best way to do that is to start moving the world towards a single currency and break down individual nations' sovereignty so you don't have to deal with their rules and regulations, exchange rates, restrictions, rulers who don't want to cooperate with you etc. How is it clear Trump is owned by rich Russians when they can't seem to pin a shred of evidence on him or his alleged ties to Russia? 

Even if Russian bankers are corrupt, the point is that they're Russian, they're not English dudes who own stock in 79 other countries and want to acquire more as they go. There is actual oversight on the Russian Federation Bank and Putin actually gets to appoint the leader and control what gets done, completely different from how our Federal Reserve works which is totally out of our hands and we have no control over it, if those private bankers want a raise for themselves, they just raise rates and the whole country scrambles at their will. I'm not saying Russia is not corrupt, just saying it doesn't cow tow to what a bunch of guys running private companies feel like doing, it's controlled  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've looked into this theory but I'm not quite there yet at believing it. One of the reasons Putin is so hated by the west is that he kicked out foreign banking cartels from his country in 2013-14 and banned them from doing business there. He is the only remaining force left that has not succumbed to the globalism agenda, even China is clearly in on it. It's pretty funny though, 'globalist' used to be some sort of tin foil hat thing, even I thought it was, but all of a sudden there are a bunch of rich people speaking 100% openly about it and they're even trying to convince people "it's the only way to stop from destroying ourselves." Like Bill Gates' recent quote. Peter Thiel talked about it in a speech, Soros has radio interviews admitting it, David Rockefeller fully admits it and is proud of it in his *Memoirs* book. Farage,  Trump, Le Pen, and Wilders are all openly admitting that is what has actually been happening to the world and has affected Europe the most during the past 10 years.

Funnily enough, Syria is also one of the several countries that Assad won't allow banking cartels to set up a private central bank in his country. A couple weeks ago when Obama was caught having his DOJ funnel money out to leftist activist groups -- one of these groups is located in Israel and is trying to oust Netanyahu from office. Did AJ really shill for Giuliani directly? I know he does shill for Trump and to an annoying degree.

A couple things don't line up for me, one is the fact that they're doing all this stuff in my first post and they are currently trying to shut out InfoWars from all social media platforms, and Google's ad company cut them out of advertising costing them (what AJ claims to be) $3million in yearly revenue. If the plan was to use a fake gatekeeper like Alex Jones to reverse psychology the globalism agenda into effect using the people that don't want it and tricking them into unknowingly favoring it, why try so hard to censor InfoWars? Why not just quietly let it go to reach more people?

Also, another thing that doesn't make sense is the fact that Robert Mercer is the guy that practically pulled Trump out from the grave he was almost in and catapulted him to the White House in a stunning upset victory. Mercer is a far right Breitbart benefactor who supports Brexit, Wilders, Le Pen, and is hated deeply by George Soros / Warren Buffet / a few others because his firm outperforms all of theirs by a lot and he's new money.  He even runs a small news media company called CNS News where all they do is call out and bash the mainstream left wing news sources.

Right now I really think Trump is something none of them expected whatsoever and they're all completely and totally furious at the fact that he won and they didn't get 4 more years of kickbacks and shady deals from the White House, lost an election where their candidate outspent the winner by 5 times, and seemingly wants to set back every single move they've been making since GWB to drain the country and put it into a massive financial crisis whereby they present the "solution" which is to consolidate countries and form a single currency / single central bank / single governmental body.

I am still looking out and watching cautiously to see if that really is the plan, I'm not 100% with it yet but every move Trump makes has to be carefully examined to see what is on the underside of it. </TEXT>

Trust in the media in general is [very low right now](http://m.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/january_2017/cable_news_viewers_still_turn_to_fox_first) and CNN has significantly less viewers considering them trustworthy than both MSNBC and FOX News.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is her right to do it (I see some people saying she should be brought up on harassment charges, I totally disagree as that is very unconstitutional and wrong IMO, harassment would be more like her following him all the way down the street to his car and then getting in her car and following him around town yelling at him for 2 hours), but it's just the fact that it was totally baseless, unnecessarily hostile, belligerent, and totally unproductive behavior. Imagine if she had approached him in a mature and civilized way, asked him if he would be willing to answer a few questions she has, and then she poses some very assertive, direct, clear-cut questions about what she wants to talk about. He would've most likely given her much more thoughtful, drawn out, and productive answers that could lead to some good discussion between both parties.

All in all, there's nothing wrong with a citizen showing concern and wanting to hold our politicians / associates accountable using her first amendment right, but there's a right and a wrong way to do it, and this was the wrong way because it led to absolutely nothing productive or good or worthwhile for either party involved, nor did it lead to any type of interesting footage that viewers like us could draw from to have a dialogue about. There should be no consequences that happen to her IMO but the main point is it just led to nothing and was hostile, pointless, and totally not worthwhile. </TEXT>

This is very sad to hear and he was a cool / funny dude on cytube and discord. He didn't post that often on here I don't think. RIP ...  if you're addicted to opiates... PLEASE GET OFF!!!!

Remember, these tweets are making reference to a guy who the author tried knocking off of the full-time list and down to per diem basis, "a couple times a week", in Opie's failed attempt to do a full Machiavelli takeover on the morning show and complete the final steps at his dumb "reinvention" that no one was interested in, finally sending the last remaining little bits of O A spirit straight down the drain and pretending they never even happened. The only thing left in his way was the co-host who actually had the sheer audacity to make some minor attempts at satisfying the fanbase by keeping bits of what O A was on the Anthony-less radio show, a show that all the fans were only even still listening to because O A is what it used to be. Opie would be the greatest parody satire type character ever created if only he was actually a parody and not genuinely this person with no awareness to it whatsoever </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's really going to burn his biscuits is he's done so little publicity that when anyone searches his name on Google, from here on out there will be a list of threads and Twitter mentions all about this. If you were a publicist or a casting director for a project, the biggest red flag would be the blatantly obvious attempt he made to drum up the outrage machine and attach his name to a story. 

He'd be like hiring a bad publicity time bomb, there is that risk of him not liking a decision the director makes or not getting his way, having his screen time cut out etc. and in response he'd try to sabotage the project by making up or embellishing a controversial story for his own publicity and for revenge on your project. Total deal breaker

It's more like a scouting report that would be sent to a SJW Facebook group saying "I was almost able to get him on this and this but there wasn't enough to latch onto here and here, we could go with the 'audience will take it the wrong way' angle, but there just won't be enough buzz for something like that" 

THere's barely any review of the actual material in it that isn't directly focused on if a joke can be seen as offensive or not. Parody is a good word, I hope at some point this type of "journalism" just keeps feeding off of its own culture and the oneupsmanship they do gets it to the point where everyone on the outside of it can't relate at all anymore and the whole thing caves in </TEXT>

Before Breuer plunged so far into corny Dad-dom he hit the point of no return he was actually somewhat liked/respected by O A fans and some of the stories he told on the show were good listens, although it's not like they were totally free from criticism or it was a complete lovefest across the board for him, he still got shit from some people

2. It's not at all and the thread title is supposed to be extra heavy on the sarcasm... from everything I've read on here since [this appeared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlPsD_oYm38) he's gone from marginally respected to nearly a universal laughing stock. He nearly redeemed himself by shutting Opester down when Opie asked him to be his afternoon cohost. I do know there's still some pretty long term fans that still post here and some that just lurk, this one might interest those people. Someone on YouTube brought up Breuer today on that video with Opie's XFL 30 for 30 blunder and said he wanted to hear these. I am running clean out of full-on archives to make for all the different shows from over the 10 Satellite years, /u/CCred95 has the full show O A and R F archive covered, but I do have some ideas for stuff to add, like an AFRO Show archive from WNEW to the last one they did some time at XM, and some other stuff too. 

3. That's why I wanted to start doing this Archive.org thing most of this stuff was all hosted on someone's home server hosting a FTP - spreadtheonavirus.com which also used to have a 24/7 XM stream for years and years. According to the dates on their FTP people had been uploading things to it as early as 2001 and they still were up to 2016, but it kept sporadically going offline more and more as time went on, and now it's been dead for a couple months straight every time I remember to check it. (It was up for like a day and a half last week then gone again) He also no longer checks his Twitter account. A huge massive collection of audio could've been gone forever and never listened to again by anyone, my unchecked OCDtism couldn't handle this. At least now it has another 10 or so more years of life before it's completely forgotten and never listened to by anyone again. </TEXT>

If you forgive Breuer for that Dad Rock stuff, which would be asking too much from just about anybody, it could be alright. If you don't hold Dad Rock stuff against the guy and liked him before maybe you even remember this show or would be interested to hear it

Credits/thanks to ILuvDogShit @ SpreadTheOnAVirus for hosting these things for half a decade on a FTP and even thanks to /u/SpaceEdge since they have that BMT title format with your name on it. Yo ho ho! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah same here... maybe it's more interesting if you actually live in NYC and have seen these people around while walking by or going there, but I don't really understand the fandom that seems to be in the comment sections of his videos, I get watching it as a fly on the wall type of thing to see weird stuff but to get invested enough to start favoring certain people over others etc.... hard to tell if people are doing it ironically like they're all living memes or they genuinely follow the whole story line and cast of characters. It's easy to forget this channel but once back in I could get hooked for 1 hour+

These 2 are what got some curiosity going last time. Free Hugs Nazi vs. Jeremy then Jeremy recaps his experience going to jail while Free Hugs Nazi has a splended time yelling taunts at him in the background

	<TEXT> I stumbled on this guy's channel one day about a month or so ago and it was one of the strangest corners of the internet I've seen in awhile that isn't fetish based or completely grotesque. I still don't really understand it at all. 

The gist I got from things after watching a few videos is that there is one guy, the camera guy, who runs a blog + this channel, he goes down and records hours of footage day after day of Union Square Park where a rag tag bunch of actual real autistics, homeless people, hippies, jobless skateboarders, hipsters, and other welfare recipients hang out every single day. 

There has developed some type of community like a bizarro Tim Berton adaption of Misfit Island from Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, where theres a core group of regular park goers who all know each other well, see each other daily, have some kind of bond, different people within the group dislike some others and have friendships with others, there's a whole complicated web of alliances and feuds between them. Every now and then some extra characters show up like random Jewish missionaries, a guy with a voice impediment who wears a suit and yells at various autistics threatening to call their moms on the phone.. I saw a crackhead who was also a bodybuilder in one.. then there is sometype of ongoing warfare involving "Free Hugs" which is actually a scheme that the autistics use to coerce people into giving them a "donation" after giving a free hug out which has led to the arrest of one of them (black) on assault charges on a female minor(?). There's fights, ballbusting, happy moments, angry moments, chaos, mob mentality, in other words, what you are seeing here is a near-perfect real life personified version of the subreddit as if it took place in real life.

Strangest of all this guy who records all this has this dedicated cult following for his channel and blog, who watch and comment on all of these videos as if this was an ongoing movie, the fans pick different park squatters like they're their favorite characters in a movie or TV show, support them, criticize them, root for them or shit talk them, idolize them, I've even seen some of the park regulars show up in YouTube comments to argue with people and shit talk the commentators right back. The entire thing is an internet black hole that offers absolutely nothing of value for anybody, but once engrossed the urge to dig deeper into it is too much to resist </TEXT>

Example: http://imgur.com/gSpK3HL

Does anyone happen to know what addon/extension this is? Looks pretty cool, I'd be interested to try it out </TEXT>

Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiTT28uVvp0 (Uploading / Processing on YouTube now)


Part 2 Rundown

Sam Hyde and Venti (the one periscoping) return to the scene at night. After a few minutes, Venti rests on the street and talks to her friend for awhile -- recommend skipping through that part as nothing happens.

Chant Wars resume afterwards and near the end of the video the police set up street barricades and the museum staff comes out and tells the crowd they need to form a line and take turns. 

At the very end of the video, Sam Hyde has a message for Shia Labeouf "You're not a real artist"

	<TEXT> Opie's phone interview with Charlie Ebersol

###Backstory

Opie and Anthony were the hosts of the XFL Pregame Show in the early 2000s. During the past few weeks/months, Opie (and I think Anthony too) have each addressed the fact that they were not invited to appear in the new 30 for 30: The XFL special, an organization they both worked closely with during their time at WNEW, and the first (and last?) nationwide TV show they were featured regularly in.

Charlie Ebersol, son of Dick Ebersol and producer of the XFL 30 for 30 calls in to promote the special and sets the record straight on Opie (and Anthony's) mysterious absence from the XFL special. 

Much to Opie's chagrin, he realizes why he "never got the invite" and it had nothing to do with ESPN not sending him one. The interview ends with a familiar Opie move, and Opie goes digging to find out what went wrong with his invite.

	<TEXT> The interview doesn't seem to be a big hit around here, I thought it was decent and somewhat entertaining but nothing too special. Although I think Jim must've gotten wind of some of the criticism people had about his last interview with Mullen. Instead of having Jimshells broken, seems like he tried harder this time. it's so obvious within the first 5-10 minutes how much different his mood and engagement to the interview is, focused the conversation on Mullen, asking questions, more excitable tone, seems more into it... of course one could easily argue the opinion that it still sucked either way. At least it's refreshing imo to have a host who listens to feedback from fans and actually tries to improve in the next interview.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely think Sam does too but he doesn't seem to want to outright admit it. Sam has made these subtle mentions and let off a bunch of tells that "he heard" or "he saw" --- and then just insert any obscure clip or 'news' that was posted here a few days or the night before after one of those phrases in quotes, live on the show. Or he makes little comments that 'people were saying' and then goes on to rephrase posts from here in a way that seems like he reads entire threads, he'll list a few things he 'heard people say' and all of them will be things that were posted by different people in the same thread a day or several days beforehand. It happens fast in a matter of seconds and it's hard to notice but it's happened a handful of times. I looked at his Twitter mentions a couple times and nobody is on there reporting things to him or sending clips to him. I'd give a strong 75% certainty that Sam is a regular visitor to the sub and keeps up with things that are posted / go on here </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting stuff, I was starting to wonder what the deal was with it but figured his tour and preparing for/shooting his special was taking up most of his time. It all makes sense, luckily I didn't give a dime to that so I have no concern about whether or not it gets finished or what the timeframe is </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't been to any other subreddits for any extended period of time in months and months. I still have mod on some other subreddits and I check the queue here and there but as far as participating in other subs, I go in, click a thread, read a comment chain where everyone is building off of a cute little pun with each response they write, talk myself down from throwing my computer out of the window, then go as far away from that thread and subreddit as I possibly can </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah neither I just have it so might as well share. It's been on my archive for awhile but only 200 views on that so many might not have gotten to hear them. Most of these came from the Data DVDs an old uploader from BiteMyTorrent mailed me last spring, some from the ~~now offline~~ (looks like it's back up actually!) SpreadTheOnAVirus FTP </TEXT>

I would love nothing more than seeing him get banned from both, my only problem is we won't be able to witness his temper tantrum afterwards cause he'll be fully shut down. However... just knowing how pissed off he'll be, flipping out and ranting to his wife about how the SJW libturds are trying to censor him is rewarding enough </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah that was horse shit. That was one of the first times on the new show that they made a random celebrity into an actual good interview

Here is the interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUjr4ABWGY

* EDIT: They uploaded the full interview to OnDemand, there was only about 10 more seconds in it. [Here is the last bit](http://streamable.com/dofe6) </TEXT>
