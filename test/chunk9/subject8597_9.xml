	<TEXT> That new AMC in Manhattan is pretty swanky. Much in common with the Warren out east. 

Maybe this new thing will tank and I can make a quick buy and turn it into my house... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I know what you mean. I saw a black and red Pebble 2 for 27 bucks brand new on Amazon last week and waited til payday only to find it gone.

I started my collection last month, and hope to keep snagging cheapies like this over the next few paychecks and assembling a full set. Aiming for 200 total. </TEXT>

Shoulda done it, Homie.

Check Groupon. I see the same watch all over there labeled Women's Pebble Watch. 40 plus shipping. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also recently got a fresh OG pebble, and afterwards was ripped off to a Woot sale and bought a time for 40 bucks.
It's awesome. Much snappier than the OG model, plus the color screen really does make the watch feel more 'premium', and it's more reasonably sized for someone with smaller wrists.

Great price at 40 bucks, but I bet in 6 months time the same watch can be had for half... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably is subjective. Try this place out sometime, I bet you can find a million reasons to yearn for a noose around here.

Besides, the fuzz once told me I can't smoke a bowl without penn time involved, now I can hop down to the corner shop and pick of a shit ton of dabs and high five the same fuzz on the way out the door.

	<TEXT> No more a waste of time than for you to view the POS today.

I was in this sub during Airdates, hating then. No reason to drop the act just because the show's off. There are plenty of you guys who think it's cool. Lots of opportunity to troll. Plus, this community is absolutely the easiest community to piss off. 

So sensitive, that months after a successfully troll, I have dickheads like you coming in here, asking for more.., </TEXT>

Sometimes, I mess with later seasons, but the pre-Potter era is all that really matters to me.

Seasons 4+ are awesome, but to me a different show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ya, so morning came. Ran an update, and now it's working. 

Pretty cool little gadget for 2 bucks and some change.

eBay gave me a 15 dollar coupon for a fubar'd order and I  found this thing shipped for 17.50. 

Now I'm thinking about a round Time...

	<TEXT> This this just came in the mail today. eBay. Looks untouched, but doesn't seem to want to turn on. It's been doing nothing but this for five hours. No combination of buttons held seems to make a difference, though for the first half or or so, it went between this screen and a Pebble logo and back and forth...

Think, maybe I got a dud? </TEXT>
