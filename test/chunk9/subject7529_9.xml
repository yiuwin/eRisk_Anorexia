	<TEXT> What... the... hell?

Breastfeeding is not natural?

What...? That's the whole point of women having breasts, like...  Yeah sure, men can feed children with artificial methods, but holy crap, I don't even know how to begin with this.

Men and women are not equal, and I don't see us being so in the near future, our bodies are different, and our minds are too, to a certain degree. We can never have absolute equality, what we can have however, is equality of opportunities, a woman wants to be an engineer? Yeah sure, go for it, do your best.

Regarding what you say in your post, and not the video, I want to make something clear: Looks matter, they just do. Looks will usually give you a first impression of someone, and that will influence in your relationship with them, without being the most important factor. We all deserve to be loved and love someone back.

But if I was given a choice to date a beautiful 20 something women and a fat ugly, 50 year old lady, I would chose none and go back to watching Con Air for the fifty-third time. Now if you know some lady who appreciates this masterpiece... that would be a blast of a date. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I don't. If you really want to go full Descartes mode, let's say that there is a thing I define as 1 and another thing I call adittion, which will give me a result based on two elements, no matter the order they are arranged, these are two concepts I just created and have no other meaning.

0 is a element that when added with another element, will always give the other element as a result.

2 is defined as the addition of a 1 and another 1. 3 will be 1+2, 4 will be 1+3, because 1+3=4 and 3=1+2, I can say that 1+2+1=4, or 1+1+1+1=4, and because 1+1=2, 2+2=4. And so on until number 10.

Now, we are using a decimal system (there are others, like second/minutes/hours, which are sexagesimal, or kind of, but this is ours), so if a number is in the left of the other one, it counts the amount of times we have addead a 9 to a 1 in the postion at the right.

All of the natural numbers are defined like this. 2, as a concept, is nothing "by itself", its just something we humans have created out of nowhere to define the addition of a 1 with another 1. It just happens to be that number 2 and additions are pretty damm usefull for us, so most of us use them and we make sure to explain how they work to others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that a study tried to manipulate data means nothing in comparison to the millions of objective studies done right. 

https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/

https://www.wunderground.com/climate/SeaIce.asp

And so many more.

But of course, if you search a bit more you can find lots of conspiracy crap like this one, on both sides, the one's denying it, and the one's warning about it:

https://www.intellihub.com/geoengineering-deliberate-melting-arctic/

How can you tell the diference?

I trust NASA, I trust Greenpeace, because they have the resources to gather data. Generally, the more data and links they give you, the better, if they also use outer unrelated sources and compare data, thats a ton of bonus points. In fact, the last link I put does have lots of data from various sources, but it never stops to explain how those justify their conclusion, it just throws random facts and then expects you to link them.

The problem, as you pointed, is that most people are forced to "trust", that they haven't personally collected the data and proved that climate change is real. Luckily, there isn't a single study that proves that climate change is not real with data that I can contrast with other studies. If you have some time and REALLY want to be sure, take some newspaper with a weather section and compare the temperature across the years, make a graph with the year mean and see for yourself. It also helps that I did work in a project to prove climate change, so it is a lot easier for me. </TEXT>

If they keep in denial I ignore them and tell myself they probably won't hurt anyone, same with creationists.

Now, with climate change negationists and people who use "natural renedies" instead of modern medicine I get really mad. I try to bombard them with data, and if doesn't work, show them how whoever told them so is taking benefit from It. My last resource is pastafarism or "Ad absurdum". The more you disolve something, the stronger its effects (Homeopathy), wow, then every glass of water has a million times the effect of the dinosaur poop disolved in it centuries ago. </TEXT>

My mother and grandmother have to disagree with that!

They were raised as a catholic and decided to live accordingly to their faith. That we were all created equal and always have to try to act honestly, be helpful and respect everyone, even if we disagree with them.

"But If they had been born in Saud Arabia..." But they weren't, I was raised as a catholic and am now a happy agnostic, and both of them are completely fine with it.

As I'm typing this my mother is asking me to tell you that religion is much more than rituals and a thousand year old book, It can be a moral compass to help you understand yourself and others.

I never felt that way, but I can understand that other people do, even if they weren't thaught so. </TEXT>

Making excuses for him and trying to live with the abuse is the most common reaction, but It will escalate. It will get worse, It WILL. It fucking always does.

He is a fucking piece of garbage, and everytime you give him something, he will want more, It never stops, It only gets worse until some day he kills you.

I can understand that you make excuses for the bruisers and the abuse, despite being a guy, I have been there. But the man you love will kill you and be absolutely okey with it. This is not a theory, I dont need to personally know him, its a statistical fact. Its only a matter of time, he will arrive drunk or whatever and stab you with a knife, and there isn't any "good time" that can compensate for that.

Fuck off, run, ask for help to family, friends, your hairdresser, someone, but you need emotional support and someone to rely on, and nobody on the Internet can give you that. He will try to isolate you, he probably started doing so long ago, thats why you have to avoid all contact with him, just get out, NOW or youll be dragged deeper in this spiral and drown, It is a matter of live or death. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Still in college, so I dont really know how things go in more profesional enviroments. I worked in a lab for 3 months with other students, 6 guys and 2 girls. We were told to work in pairs, and one of us refused to work with a girl because he "didn't want to be the only one working", I wanted to say something but everyone remained silent, so I shut my mouth and felt like shit.

I ended up working with him, guess who had to do 90% of the work.

Anyways, next week, we had to work with some rare products. The most common ones are stored in low shelves, because you have to use them all the time, while the top shelves are for the rarest. I told him to take it, while I prepared a dry-disolution, which means that it cant be exposed to humid air, so is stored with nytrogen, extracting It is easy but takes quite some time.

So suddenly he comes and says that he is too short to take that product, and I answer that I need some time to finish, and to use a chair or something. Then Ana (one of 2 girls) steps in and says that she can take it... If he says "please".

We didn't develop any groundbreaking semiconductor like we intended, but I discovered that a human face can go from almost white to tomato red in half a second. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gil'dar, "the Shamed".

For a orc, nothing is more important than strength, and since childhood they are trained in the arts of war. Gil'dar was a prodigy among equalls, his sheer power and bravery unmatched. His future was to become the greatest warchief in Orc history and die a glorious death.

However, the kid had other plans. He rejected the ideology of his father, and tried to hide his unparaleled skill. But in the heat of combat, he raged, he burned with rage, and always lost to his nature.

He tried to lurk in the darkness, become a shadow, to hide from the world, but his stealth skills were not the finest, even when compared to orc standards. His father beat him down over and over to make a warrior of him, show him the joy of battle, but could never put his son in "the right" tracks. The only thing his son ever learned was that every living being has the right to die a honorable death.

However, at the age of 18, he was given a chance to change. His father was found dead in his bed, with a brutal yet clean cut in his throat, a job of the Dark Brotherhood.

Gil'dar saw his destiny in front of him, and scaped from his hometown to join the Dark Brotherhood and become the greatest assasin of all time.

On his way, he discovered a skirmish between the Imperials and the Stormcloaks. He hid in some bushes to watch unnoticed, but he started to cheer the skill of a certain Stormcloaks warrior, who seemed some kind of warchief, he was spotted by the imperials and held prisoner.

In combat, he always tries to be sneaky and kill his victims without them knowing what's after them, but his stealth is terrible, and he keeps forgetting to wear assasin boots, instead of his heavy iron ones, so he is always forced to finish things in hand to hand combat.

His name is feared, even among the hard to impress guards of Skyrim, but never for the reasons he wants. </TEXT>

The more heroes you have the better. You will always encounter a boss or event where your teams aren't the most suited ones. It's alright to fail a boss, If you learn from the experience and think of a better strategy.

Keep working on It, and in no time you will achieve victory! (laughs maniacally) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, sorry for trying to bring peace and order to this harsh land, you filthy traitor. Real men fight in fair duels, not using magic like that coward who commands you did, but I guess you cant expect more from savage brutes. Also Talos smells bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Heroes, by Joe Abercrombie.

A story about a battle, with a lot of cool narrative tricks, like that part where the battle is narrated in first person, and each time the narrator dies, we jump into the perspective of his assasin, over, and over, and... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a guy I can tell you that he probably felt It was a personal attack to him, not by you, but your "friends", how would you feel with him if he told you that another woman asked him to have sex? 

Of course, It wouldnt be his fault, but its hard to be calmed in this situations. Talk with him about it and try to explain your situation, he will probably be more comprehensive now that some time has passed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gateway, by Frederic Pohl.

Its a sci-fi book with one of the most fucked up protagonists I have ever seen, half of the book is him going to therapy to solve his many issues, without much sucess. 

The other half is about the mindset of explorer, the men and women that get into the worst conditions, with the constant risk of death, and a minimum chance of discovering something and making a fortune. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, she was a Nord living in a small village with a passion for carpentry, she wasn't the most skilled, but she still put her hearth in every piece she crafted. She was happily married to a man called Torbrun, who worked in a mill. One day, she went to the woods to find some oak for her pieces, she spend the whole afternoon but couldn't find a single one, she returned to the village by the sunset, only to find out It had been destroyed in a battle between the imperials and the stormcloaks who were still fighting, she ran to the mill to try find her husband, but someone had set It on fire.

She heard screams coming from the inside, apparently, the roof had collapsed and blocked the only door. She tried to open a way with her axe, but she was exhausted after wandering in the forest for hours, and couldn't even scratch the door. As everything she loved burned down, she swore to take revenge, no matter what it cost.

So basically she is a Nord in light Armour, dual wielding axes, and is mad at both the imperials and the Stormcloaks. No main questline, no dragonborn crap, no guilds, just constant soldier chopping. Only put perks in one handed combat, light Armour and smithing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, have been playing the game for the last 3 years +500 hours, no mods, no dlc, I like Vanilla that much. Since my second character I have been always roleplaying, I would make up unnecesarily complex backstories for my characters, give them personality, and follow It until the last consequences, no matter how messed up, Elija the Psyco Carpenter, you won't be forgotten.

And this whole friggin time I thought I was a weirdo and never told anyone because I thought that It seemed really stupid, only to find out a fuckton of people in this subreddit who also love roleplaying. 

Thank you for existing guys. </TEXT>
