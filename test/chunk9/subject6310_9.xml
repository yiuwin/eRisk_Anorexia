	<TITLE> I'm looking for an anime where it's a romance between older sister and younger brother. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-27 14:04:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As stated above is the main basis so anything that involves that would be welcome, but now specifics and preferences. The ages of either of them can not be any younger than high school age 15+. Nothing of too much of an extreme age gap, few years would be best (remember its older sister, not brother) it would help if they lived together, but not required. The relationship would be the main focus of the show, the more progress the better but not a necessity. please anime not manga. Blood or step doesn't matter.
I would also like it to be set during the last 2 decades, and if it mainly centered around a high school for location.
Please and thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Advances in all aspects of technology inspired by war.
- his rocket experiments with the early v2 resulted in advancing research which helped the space race. Which further impacted us with what we have achieved with that technology. 
-advances in computing created by allies.

The findings from the [cruelty to pow prisoners and human experimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation#Freezing_experiments) are still used today as a basis for some medical stuff to treat people today (though grateful might be controversal), since no one is going to repeat the tests and the results are there. Better to use them and not let their suffering go to waste or to leave it as using the findings would somehow condone their actions. (star trek does an episode about this) Unfortunately recent research are finding the data to be obsolete or not as accurate.   

he did pull germany out of their crippling economy but then kinda went and started ww2.

I'm sure there are more but my knowledge is only from documentries so this could easily be wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1: really liked it, it wasn't the best tv show i've watched but I couldn't stop watching it. binged it in like 3 days.

2: I got a real 'lost' vibe from the show. (the lost tv show) mostly when I realised that they didnt answer alot of questions or didn't go back.

3: I missed the arctic but an island was the next best choice, I was expecting season 2 to be like the movie taken where allan goes looking for julia for the whole season so I liked the direction it took.

4:season 2, what the fuck? like the show became less 'scary and more wtf' meaning babies in jars,toothless sisters,dead bodies as dinner guests,incest..etc

5: I wished they explored more of ilaria corp and the origins of the immortals.

6: all through seas 2 and 2 was it just me but when ever some one is alone or looking for someone else the character finds nothing and and turns around and pop the danger thing is there, it became so much I just started laughing when the boy was taken, lol no eyed.

7: I wished they wrapped up the loose ends or had another season :( </TEXT>

If the guy is underaged and raped he still has to pay child support if the baby is born. The man will even have to leave school and get a job to pay if so, even if the man was against the child in the first place because the moneys for the child not the mother.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A music video where all the lyrics are in different fonts like logos and are all on screen. The words are all blacked out until it is needed and it lights up. An x is always lighting up on the beat in the bottom right corner. I watched the behind the scenes and it was all practical, the guys hit switches to light the boxes with the words on cue with the vocals. I dont remember the song only a couple of words like dream was in the top left and was frequent. And waiting ,please help me I already asked this question in another sub by mistake!! </TEXT>
