	<TEXT> I lost my faith in a similar way. Best friend committed suicide a couple days before Christmas, leaving behind a young wife with no friends or family in the area, who was due to give birth any day now. I realized that there is no sensible way that this is part of some kind of plan. Nothing good comes out of it, just grieving family and friends. God is a selfish sadistic asshole if these are his plans </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The scene in Full Metal Jacket where Private Pyle gets beat with soap and he's crying in the silence while private Joker is covering his ears trying to drown him out. The look on his face is what gets me, sadness, regret and fear, but mostly regret  </TEXT>
