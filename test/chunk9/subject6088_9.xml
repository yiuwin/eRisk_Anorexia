	<TEXT> Yeah well you have to buy that apartment too. So it's not effort free. I don't think it's such a big deal but that's what people think. 

Personally I wouldn't *mind* doing it, but sitting at $80M right now I'm not that motivated to do heists again anyway.

	<TEXT> The reason shark cards exist is for the casual player who can't afford grinding time. They just buy a card and get instant access to expensive items. 

If you are casual AND you can't afford charm cards, that's your own problem. R* isn't obligated or motivated to make a game for people who have no money and no time to pay for or play their game. That makes no sense.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not how it's supposed to work. If you process it in your iFruit, when you log back into the game and get into your car, you're supposed to get a notification that tells you to bring your car to LSC. 

when you do, it gives one option to select the purchase of your new plate. There is no other menu. If it click ok you're done and it kicks your car out. 

If you're able to go to the menu and select plates, it didn't work right.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the small warehouse. It's 16 crates (6 sourcing trips) and a delivery trip to make $240,000. And right now -- until May 15 -- that's $300,000 gross.

Net of 4x 3-crate trips and 2x 2-crate trips is $84,000 investment for $240,000 returns. Meaning net profit of $156,000 with 6 trips. If you don't mind making more trips and taking your time, you can do single-crate trips and net  $208,000

It's not the worst. It can be tedious but not more or less tedious than sourcing and selling cars over and over, either.

My method is super straight forward.

 Be in Buzzard, start Takeover. 

 Fly straight into the hangar making sure your weapons do not lock on until you're close (locking on triggers the cops)

 Blast the people in the hangar, usually two missions kills everyone. Sometimes it takes a 3rd missile. 

 skid to a halt and let the Buzzard grab the case as your come in hot. 

 fly away.  </TEXT>

It only appears closer because the radar's center is at the bottom of the phone screen. So that dot down at the bottom that suddenly seems really close, is not close. It's just nearer to the center because of the screen's offset. 

So only pay attention to the dot that is ahead of you, and if THAT dot is close to your radar's center, then that means the vehicle is close.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About a year or so ago, I took a break from GTAO because a buddy was trying to get me into Destiny. It was a hard battle for him cuz I was *REALLY* into gta. But eventually I began playing Destiny and after some people I met in-game took me through a couple of raids, I got hooked. I tabled GTAO before the MC DLC came out, right around the ill-gotten gains dlc. 

I started playing Destiny single player a lot at first but then got really into the Raids. Eventually I began playing the role of Sherpa for randoms and started taking new players through the raids and showing them where to go, what to do, and introducing them to the game mechanics that are unique in each raid. In these sessions, it's normal for players to die repeatedly and having to restart was expected. 

When I wasn't playing Sherpa for new players, I'd just join raid groups and blow through them every week before the weekly reset. Every once in a while on these raid groups of experienced players, you'd always get a guy who was vouching for a new player. "He's never done it but he's good at it. It won't be hard" they'd implore. Ok fine so I'm a group of six, we'd have 5 experienced guys and one n00b. 

In these situations I really wouldn't have that much patience. If the noob messed up and died more than a handful of times I'd bounce. Sorry fellas. I didn't sign on today to play Sherpa. I thought we were just trying to get through this quickly. 

I can imagine the frustration of these types of failures when it's Pac Standard and all you want to do is finish it but you're stuck because the noob is a friend of a friend. 

That must've really sucked. Sorry, bro.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-05-11 03:23:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was happily delivering a full large warehouse of special crates in a peaceful solo-public lobby. It was the three-Brickade mission that involves only one delivery each, with use of the Trafficky app. 

I deliver the first two and while in transit with the third, I see a notification on my screen in the lower left. "So-and-so killed so-and-so"

Oh crap. The lobby is filling up! I hope I make it to my destination without getting wrecked. 

Checking the map it looks like everyone is nowhere near downtown (where I'm headed.) I make it to my destination unmolested and because 13 people flooded into my lobby I got a total of $3,135,750 instead of the usual $2,220,000 or even the $2,775,000 for the 25% bonus event!

That's one time I was glad the lobby filled up last-minute! (It must be nice being those CEO friendly lobby dudes if this is what they see all the time!) </TEXT>

That's not bad. 6-missions plus delivery for $216,000 is pretty competitive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The weight distribution was kinda flawed with the engine, transmission and the like being behind the driver, leaving little weight to push the front tires down.
So, in a turn the tires could easily lose grip causing the terrible oversteer.

A mid-engine setup that provides a 50/50 weight distribution is not "flawed." It's actually ideal. 

Also, even if you were losing grip in the front tires in a turn, that wouldn't cause oversteer. That would result in understeer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Easiest way:

PS4 menu  settings  internet setting  set up internet connection  choose custom instead of easy

Select all default settings by hitting X

When you get to MTU settings, change it from default 1500 to either 800 or 900. I use 900 but both work. 

Hit X to accept and back out to game. No need to test internet settings unless you want to. 

Super reliable, always solo. It usually stays solo for 6-7 or 8 hours before anyone joins. It's less ironclad if you invite a friend, although I find that if you stay away from your friend (like if you do CEO work in the city and he's in Blaine County doing MC work) it will still last a long time before anyone else joins.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems plausible. But the bonus event for crates SHOWS the crate value as you're building your collection. The bonus price is accounted for. 

I would assume any bonuses would also be listed in the coke sales on the OpenRoad program at your lockup. No?

But I still got the $420,000 for full delivery. The game even said "failed" to deliver and JLT called to console me. 

Anyone know what the deal is? </TEXT>

I drive it in and park it near the doorway. Everyone ignores you until you throw a punch or hold L1 (targeting) 

Now that everyone is trying to fight you, go back up the steps to the exit and lure them there. 

Get to a safe distance and trigger it. 

It might not kill everyone but the fire will kill some more. Now you can either grab the supplies which has been dropped or fight one or two survivors who are carrying it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This depends on what you mean by "worth it"

*Is it the highest $/minute earner?* No. 

*Will you make your investment back quickly?* Depends on how much you play, but I say yes. And probably in three or four day's play time. 

*will you actually profit a meaningful amount? Like in order to start buying super cars and other cool stuff?* yes and no. Ideally if you have a coke business, you're also running it with other MC businesses or CEO work. If you do combine businesses, you will start making more money than you know what to do with. I mean if you play 4-5 hours a day, you will start making around a million dollars every day. 

I have CEO car warehouse; small medium and large crate warehouses; a coke, meth, weed, and counterfeit business. No forgery biz. I heard it's unprofitable. 

Yesterday I played for about 4-5 hours sourcing and delivering various things that were at various stages of capacity. I also went AFK for a good while during NBA playoffs and ended up making $1.7-$1.8M before turning off the PlayStation. 

You have to start investing in these businesses in order to start making money. There's no quick cash solution and there's no way around it. Just get your feet wet and start hustling. The money will come and it will hit you hard. I will even get to the point where you'd rather shut down a business and cut off the cash for a bit because there are too many things to think about. That's sort of where I am right now haha

Edit: I should also add that -- to me -- it's way more fun than CEO work. It also makes more sense lore-wise. Why would a big CEO tycoon drive a trash truck to deliver drugs? The head of a biker gang who has chemists under his employment producing meth while he goes to fetch more supplies? That makes more sense. And occasionally he has to kill some cops and a narc who's about to rat out his coke business. To me that's all way more fun than the CEO grind. Seriously, fuck that 3-crate sourcing mission with the crashed plane up in Malibu. </TEXT>

But this stat reads as $0. Also I'm pretty sure I've received cash from shared money after jobs before too. But the stat that reads "received from others" also reads $0.

	<TEXT> I don't buy 3 at a time as that takes a large chunk out your profits.

You need to evaluate this as $/minute not dollar per returns. Yes, $2000 per crate x8 is only $16,000. But if you do $6000 per two crates, you only need to do it 4 times and spend $24,000. 

8 trips versus 4 trips means you can sell TWO sets of 8 in the time you normally sell only one set.

So if you like selling 8-crates at a time, that's $48,000 invested in $160,000 earnings in the same amount of time as $16,000 for $80,000. 

You net $122,000 doing two-crates-at-a-time in the same amount of trips as $64,000 for one-crate purchases.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually jump in the titan or whatever plane so the destination checkpoints show up on the map. Then I hop out and get in a Hydra and do a quick reconnaissance run near those checkpoints to check for and clear any enemies. Then I come back to fly the Titan or whatever. There's plenty of time to do that.

Your other option if you encounter enemies, is to land the plane and fight them. Then continue the drops. 

Last resort, abort the mission by disconnecting your internet (or closing the app abruptly, making sure the game does not have time to save) and then resupply your missing crates (you'll just lose three) and try again, hoping for a different mission.  </TEXT>

 go back to game and find your duplicate car on the street and your new money in your wallet.
