	<TEXT> I'd prefer a global electoral college. /s

More seriously, it's likely that countries would send already-elected legislators who were part of economic committees. Also, it would have to vary by country, since not all member states are democracies. The point is, there won't be a global popular election, but the process will be much more democratic than what exists now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not something I expect will gain a lot of support, but hear me out. IFIs and intergovernmental trade organizations such as these are the most powerful institutions in the world today. The IMF has the ability to control which governments survive and which collapse by deciding whether or not to make a loan to a country with a crashing economy. The WTO determines how easily developing countries can get access to medicines produced in the West. Taken together, these organizations arguably have more power than any country or corporation.

My view is that these institutions have become something of a weak world government that is highly undemocratic and usually unaccountable. In the World Bank, only 8 out of 189 members have direct representation on the Executive Board. The board "elects" a President, but the vote is weighted so that the US has by far the most deciding power. Oh, and the President must be an American.

As you can expect, newer and poorer member states are at a disadvantage. The organizations are rarely held accountable when they screw over these countries, since they barely have any representation. But even if you're an American, you can't really say the World Bank represents your views. You vote for a President, who assigns a Treasury Secretary, who joins a board, which votes for the World Bank President. The whole process is convoluted and opaque.

I'm not an anti-globalist. I do understand the importance of these organizations in maintaining international financial stability. But at the same time I feel like nobody sees how much power and how little accountability they have. The people who lead these institutions aren't subject to the same checks and open scrutiny that elected politicians have, even though politicians have much less power. My solution is that IFI leadership should be directly elected by the people. This might seem awkward, but it wouldn't be completely unprecedented: the ASEAN and Benelux economic groups already have elected parliaments. Maybe they would be a good model to follow. I'm open to other options. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The cost to an individual company wouldn't necessarily be net neutral. The biggest polluters (i.e. the airline industry) would definitely take a hit from the carbon tax, and the lower corporate tax rate would not fully compensate. Minor polluters would benefit. By revenue-neutral I meant that there is no increase in the overall tax rate for the economy at large. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In this scenario, a carbon tax is placed on all businesses, but the corporate tax rate is lowered so the new system is revenue-neutral. Are any of the typical downsides of a carbon tax, such as higher energy costs, still a problem? I assume energy would still be more expensive, but it should be offset by a decline in the cost of goods across the board. And at the same time, you're reducing carbon emissions. </TEXT>
