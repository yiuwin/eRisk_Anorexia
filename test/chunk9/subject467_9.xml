	<TEXT> I was more referring to things like cheese as an example. When Americans talk about cheese its usually in reference to a particular brand. Brands do exist over here too but you're more likely to talk about a *type* of cheese (chedder, brie, roquefort, etc) from a particular area. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's fascinating. I come from a French/British background of cooking and a lot of the recipes i see on here seem really strange to me, (powders and branded products rather than fresh ingredients and farm produce). I'd love to do a cooking tour of the states at some point, the food culture seems so much more evangelical over there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We moved into an ex-council flat at the beginning of December, signed a tenancy agreement, everything seems to check out our end.

However - we've since opened a few letters (out of a large deluge) that have come to the flat addressed to the landlord. 

He owes a lot of money: almost 100,000 in wrongly paid housing/council tax benefit and a bit extra to banks etc. I'm a bit wary of raising this with anyone in case we are moved out of the property which we cant afford to happen at the moment. 

The whole thing makes me feel a bit uneasy at the moment though so I'm not sure what the best course of action is. On the one hand we shouldn't have opened any letters (so technically we still don't know about all this), but on the other this could have serious impact on our living situation. </TEXT>

Tomorrow I'll be moving to near Hoxton station and was wondering if there is anything similar in the surrounding area? I used to be a chef so these types of market are 10 times better than the supermarket and usually half the price! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Video editing. I worked at a production house on documentaries out of university where I was an edit assistant. They gave me a shot editing promos and trailers and it turns out I was really fast and precise. Producers who would edit with me though I'd been in the field for years. 

It can be really demoralising though when you have no interest in what you're cutting. To have a good end product you have to get super invested in the material which could be literally anything. I've edited things from Jewish bikers to Web am models, Moronic reality TV to daytime "documentaries" about dogs. 

Now I animate motion graphics for the highest bidder. More pretty pictures, less hours and hours of sifting through dull footage.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We just found a 3 bed sharer with a really similar budget to you. we will be paying 560pm each without bills in hoxton

Ultimately your budget determines what you get, obviously everyone wants to live somewhere lovely and in a great location but the reality is tradeoffs. for instance, a lot of places are this price because they don't have a living room which works for some people. Personally i wanted a living room and a nice location so i traded off the quality of the place (shabby upholstry and kinda dirty) for a brilliant location and big rooms.

My advice is to just get out and looking at places to get an idea of what your budget can afford. Put aside 100 each per month for bills and be real with yourself, its not worth struggling every month just to afford a marginally nicer place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually much prefer the Original. There's a little too much going on which is easy to do when you're layering up for an effect like this. 

Take a look at your blurring too, the DOF is very strong for a start but more importantly the motion blur doesn't make sense - if the wheel is spinning then the car will be moving, so if the camera is following the car then the road should be blurred.

I would suggest working to more reference images which are useful as a jumping off point when trying to create a more stylized image. Its tempting to blur things and hide imperfections but remember - you can always undo! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In all honesty exercise is your friend. But unless its **something you enjoy** doing then it will just be a chore and you'll give up after a couple of sessions.

Some people enjoy going to the gym but personally I've never been able to go for more than a few weeks straight before getting bored. Swimming, cycling and rock climbing however and i can almost go every day because i **look forward to it** so much. If its a chore you simply wont go.

**Find something you enjoy** and do it a couple of days a week. Not only will you notice less of a belly within a few weeks, if you keep going you'll start to get really fit and notice yourself getting better at the sport.

Food is important too but its just down to calory intake really, eat less calories than you burn and you'll lose weight. </TEXT>

We've been playing a lot of: Speedrunners, Legend of Dungeon, Worms, Sonic all stars racing Transformed, Spelunky. 

It would be great to find some more, either coop or with a tense competitive multiplayer! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its an aesthetic thing. In the same way as a photographer tries to get rid of imperfections like grain, blur and aberration it is necessary with 3d renders to add this stuff back in to make it all sit together nicely.

A bit like when vinyl in its heyday people would try to get the cleanest sound possible, now with lossless digital production we try and add back in the warmth and feel of a vinyl pressing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Living and working in central London I cycle around 100 miles a week through the city. I see a lot of people with [masks on which i can only assume are for emmisions](http://www.cyclesurgery.com/pws/UniqueProductKey.ice?ProductID=MS17XX gclid=CLfCj6ya9bkCFYdc3godyEIAVQ).

Only that looking through the descriptions they seem to be no more than dust masks to protect against particles the size of pollen and such, which would surely be much bigger than emissions from cars and buses.

Does anyone have any experience with these? Given the amount of time stuck behind London buses and cabs it seems like a good idea to try and breathe easy!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually cycle in that area a lot, its a hilly haven in the South of Britain where usually there isn't much in the way of elevation.

The locals are probably just a bit butt-hurt, they are really classic picturesque villages around there (gomshall and peaslake especially) and they do get taken over on the weekends by roadies and mountain bikers. The thing is, we also bring a hell of lot of money to the villages.

Out of the hundreds of cyclists that frequent there are bound to be a percentage that don't give a crap so much, but that can easily be said of the motorists too. Lots of weekend racers in their Mazdas and MGs bombing around the lanes. Generally a cyclist likes to decide when its safe for a car to pass for this reason and don't take kindly to being forced onto the verge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand what you're saying but the theme has been to dilute these movies somehow. The classics are so because they have some kind of magic that usually gets lost in a remake. 

"the day the earth stood still" is a good example. In my opinion the remake wasn't ball achingly terrible but it wasn't very good either. It was just another action flick and lost out on a lot of what made the original so memorable. It still made a lot of money but is ultimately forgotten and perhaps therefore pointless?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will probably be buried now but i find this really interesting:

My cousin speaks four languages and is absolutely fluent in both French and English. She says that she thinks in whatever language she's speaking and can flip between the two without a moments hesitation. (I've seen her do it too and it's incredible, especially when we were 10!) 

What I find more interesting though is that she says each language is good at specific different things. There are some situations where English just doesn't have a phrase or word for and vice versa. A good common example is what translates to: "the call of the void" which is that feeling you get when standing on the edge of something high up or a train platform telling you it could be so easy just to jump. 

Also to note I stayed with a Dutch friend of mine for a week not long ago and he said having been talking primarily to me he had begun to think and even dream in English. Again he found it frustrating but more because his vocabulary is obviously smaller so he can't articulate his thoughts as sussinctly as when thinking in Dutch! 

This got me thinking, can vocabulary be linked directly at all to intelligence?  </TEXT>
