	<TEXT> He said "golden-maned", which leads me to believe he means golden hair. 

If he had said golden head or golden helmet, I'd absolutely agree.

Also, Adam Warlock is known to be in a chrysalis. Richard Rider is not.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you 100%. I think Dave Chappelle phrased it best when he said "the *historically* disenfranchised". 

Now that politics and racial identity have become a bigger part of the conversation, guys like this are realizing their opinion doesn't matter as much or they're not the center of attention anymore and he feels disenfranchised.

Yet him, and guys like him, can't wrap their head around the fact that minorities have historically felt this way, it's nothing new for them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't go outside in the winter? B.S. I'm Canadian and go outside in the winter everyday and did it at school as a kid for recess and half of lunch time. If it is cloudy, you still get UVB exposure, it's just reduced so stay outside for 30 mins[...]

Yeah you know, just stand in the freezing cold temperatures as those clouds bathe you in Vitamin D. Or I dunno....drink milk which people have been doing forever.

Eggs and milk are two very shitty things that we shouldnt eat but it just became the norm out of nowhere.

They have necessary vitamins and were an easy way to supplement lack of meat from hunting or a poor crop. It really wasn't out of nowhere at all.

	<TEXT> Rules put every player on an even playing field. So a player who doesn't RP as well won't necessarily be outdone by one who RP's very well simply because the more experienced player can describe his kill or his actions better.

A new player may run across the deck of a ship, whereas a more experienced player may say "I quickly climb the nearest rope and swing across to the other side of the ship, plunging my sword into the nearest enemy". 

My point is, rules make it so both players meet in the middle. At least that's how I've always felt. </TEXT>

I feel like such a killjoy when I tell people I think the last few books aren't very good. I generally just keep it to myself to not be an ass.

I also imagine a lot of people merge the show and the books in their heads and treat it all as one thing which makes poorly thought out books seem so much better. </TEXT>

As much as I enjoy ASOIAF, there's much better fantasy out there for sure. I could barely get through the last book. It felt so convoluted. It was like trudging through a literary swamp.

I never understand the people who don't go try some more fantasy. There's so much of it in all different types and sub genres. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it seems to be a common theme that the create of a super hero necessitates the creation of challengers and such.

One common theme used in Batman comics is that all his villains exist almost purely because of him. Basically he dressed as a bat to get to the mafia, then others began copying him with themes and such. 

It's a cool concept imo.  </TEXT>

Although I don't genuinely know what TSAs powers are, I bet they could just call over a police officer while keeping you in some administrative hold or something.

Translation: I didn't know this sub existed for two years, so obviously it didn't matter until this very moment. 

To most anyone, a conspiracy theorist is a pretty open minded individual.

This just isn't true. It always reminds me of the phrase (and this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFO6ZhUW38w)), "If you open your mind too much, your brain will fall out."  </TEXT>
