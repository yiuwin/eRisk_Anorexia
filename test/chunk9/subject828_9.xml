	<TEXT> What I think most people's problems are with him, and what I love how he plays, is how pretty much all his moves can somehow be chained to one another in different ways. Instead of the same old spam chains from other heroes, his is different every time and so it's hard to predict. Very cool and more reactionary. Shinobi is kind of the same way it seems. Makes fights super fast and brutal. I hope they redo the original heroes in the same manner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's just like Shugoki's charged heavy. The indicator starts waaaay off when it's building up. And Cent's is only unblockable as a finisher, but can be from any direction. Just wait for the flash! I always fuck up parrying Zerk's because of their weird timing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I was having trouble with it too. It needs to be fast. Fast as in you need to hit it while the parry animation is still going because what he does goes off of that anim. </TEXT>
