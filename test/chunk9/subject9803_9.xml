	<TEXT> I think you need to be careful when equating Arcadium with actual gaming culture and Lexington having a gaming scene. I love Arcadium as much as the next guy, I drop Atleast 5 bucks into the arcades when I go. But I'd say 90% or more of the crowd is just there because it's a cool hip bar and MAY play a game if they get drunk. Theyre not they're to be gamers or watch a smash tourney (though that'd be sweet) they're there to be hang out and drink craft beers in a hipster bar. I think it's possible to have a real gamer bar, but the issue will be the cost. Arcadium's arcades are basically free (a quarter a pop) so Depending on what I play I can pay about a dollar for an hour of gaming. if I had to pay an hourly fee (say 10 bucks an hour, and say I'm there for 4 hours) dropping 40 bucks seems like a lot to play some video games, shit o could basically buy the game for that. So I guess what I'm saying is be realistic about your pricing and understand it'll take some time before you can build up a scene.... but if you get some Smash or street fighter or marvel vs capcon tournaments going.... I'll probably swing by.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to preface this by saying i know absolutely nothing about structural engineering or construction.... 

I drive by it every day, and always looks in. Yes, they have put up the bottom of the wall, but for a project the size of this, i'm amazed i've never seen more than 10 people (usually less) working in the pit. I'm sure theres time/ saftey things that you need to pour cement, allow for prep, for drying, etc, but theres no way that it takes a professional crew 6 months to put up an 8 foot tall cement wall. If they wanted to actually get this done, they'd have soooo many more people in there working around the clock, but IMO, the work that Webb is having his men do is just enough so that he can say, "look at what i've accomplished, you can't fill this in, but really if you want to finish on schedual...i do need some more money"

TLDR: Webb is doing just enough not to lose the project, but just as little as he can until he gets more money.... in case, nothing will really change.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My opinion trying to look at it from an unbiased standpoint...

Stafford and the lions were beastly in the first half, and then looked really rough in the second
Luck and the Colts were really shakey in the first, but looked beastly in the Second.
So its one of those, "even though the colts lost, they looked better than the lions in the end of the game, so people will say the lions looked like the same old lions and the colts looked good, just need to start stronger" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So antidotal, but when I was a bartender at a loud packed bar, I'd make a mental que of the people in "line" ei, who was there the longest- who just got there, and serve them in that order. If it was your turn, and your in the middle of a conversation with a group behind you and I have to yell at you to get your attention to get your order, I'm probably just moving onto the next person. Call me an asshole all you want, but I'm trying to get as many people their drinks in as short of a time as possible, Not just you, so you adding more time to serve you not only loses me money (less sales =less tips) but it slows the progression of the que, which makes people annoyed  

Also sorry you've been here for 15 minutes.... But you came to a packed bar on Thursday, Friday or Saturday night, what you expect. 

Call it dumb all you want, but bar etiquette is a thing, and imo, following some simple rules can help your experience </TEXT>

I've experienced shitty bartenders, I don't think they were using any personal prejudges against me, some people are just shitty bartenders. could they have been racist... possibly. could they just suck.... probably.  

.... maybe you just aren't great at getting the bartenders attention.

	<TEXT> So all those lines that are the misc lines left over as a result of carving are called chatter, some people like it, some don't (i'm in the 2nd camp) so what i do to save myself a lot of time and headache, is if i'm going to have a lot of negative space around my boarders or in the middle of my image where i don't want any chatter, i'll just cut off that piece of the block.

Like here, i wanted a clean boarder, so i just cut off everything else.

	<TEXT> Thanks, 

So about the saltiness. This is just my personal opinion, but I feel like I've seen a lot of print mess ups that people think "look interesting" and when I started I kinda liked those imperfections too, but the more you print, and the more you see newer printmakers make those same imperfections the more you start to think that it's more of a "they don't know what they're doing" rather than "they're trying to get it to look like that.

That being said, if you like that look, don't let me stop you. I'm by no means any authority of print. 

Keep up the good work man. Also if you have yet, you might wanna check out jenni Schmid.

	<TEXT> didn't take many process photos of this one, but this is the print about a day and a half into working on it, excuse the IG tilt shift: https://www.instagram.com/p/BIQjZKUBHxy/?taken-by=toddherzberg

this isn't this print but its what the process of carving looks like:
https://www.instagram.com/p/yV2DwDDowM/?taken-by=toddherzberg

Basically you're carving out all the areas you want to stay white. After the print is carved you roll over it with a brayer which is like a large rolling pin covered in ink, all the areas you've carved are below the surface, and so they don't get ink on them. after you've rolled it up, you put it on a press, put the paper on top of that, then run it through the press, which pushes the the paper against the inky block transfering the reversed image onto the paper. then you repeat that over and over.

	<TEXT> Had the JDI and Columbia... Honestly I felt like the Columbia was kinda meh, huge burger, but flavor was basic. The JDI was  Really good, like my favorite so far outa 5 burgers, though I will say your lack of bourbon flavor comment was spot on.

 Granted I went to JDI on Monday at 11 (before the lunch rush) and went to Columbia 20 minutes before close (shame on me). So I'm sure that could figure in on things as well as personal taste/ preference  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like someone else mentioned, If I'm transferring something I just do a chalk/ charcoal rubbing..... but if you want to get a pretty exact digital transfer, (if I recall how I did it) I'd use a basic Xerox copier print out your image, and tape it to the block, take a second sheet of paper spray it with acetone (so the whole thing is damp, quickly put it on the block, put some news print on that run it thru dat press. And BOOM transfer..... I think that's how I did it once.... But now that I think of it, dunno if acetone would be great for Lino. </TEXT>

I was/ am part of an ongoing discussion about curved foods, what counts as curved foods and what doesn't, so I figured I'd make a quick print to memorialize that convo.

	<TEXT> So this was basically just a test print to see if i could accurately register a silkscreen and relief print accurately . long story short, i carved the Key (the relief print), made a registration sheet for it, printed it, scanned that print into photoshop, did the backround, broke it into CMY (left out the black layer). when i printed the silkscreen, i registered it with that original relief print, so that the silk screen would line up with that block. Then after the Silkscreen was printed, then i went back to the block and printed that on top of everything. and it think it turned out pretty decently, minus a pretty slight registration issue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now i hate going to any shopping center in October to hear christmas but....... i'd say shooting fireworks off on July 2nd (the Saturday of independence day weekend) is a horrible analogy. thats like saying, "WTF why are they playing christmas music on December 23?! they already have Christmas and Christmas Eve, seriously thats all they really need!" 

My dog hates fireworks as much as the next, but dealing with a freaked out dog kinda what you have to expect as a dog owner come Independence day

	<TEXT> depending on the size of your blocks, I'd get the pack of (3) 24"x36" Battleship grey lino from dick blick, and cut it down from there. its basically $20 a sheet, and if you buy something else for 40 bucks, you'll get free shipping.

	<TEXT> So i don't really fully cleaning my blocks I feel like throwing too many solvents/ whatever on the blocks slowly degrades them, so what i'll do is run the block thru the press with newsprint (without inking up the block each time) until the block print is basically just an embossment with a little bit of color. this will get most of the ink off the block, then sometimes i'll take a rag and rub the block a bit to get some more of the remaining ink off the block, but thats not really needed. 

one issue if you don't clean the block at all is the ink can clump up/ dry weird, and when you go to print it again, some areas might ink up splotchy... atleast thats whats happened to me.

	<TEXT> its hard to explain really briefly and coherently, to this will be a bit of a tangent.... to me the ski masks embody as sense of poverty/ desperation/ shame which is where i feel a lot of people in my generation are, we've been told we've been given everything, yet we achieve less than our parents (kinda). My father graduated HS, got a job at GM and was upper middle class by 20. those opportunities are no longer available, yet we're held to those unattainable standards.

The series is titled "Adulting" and this was my artist statement for it:


There are milestones in people's lives that make a moment of understanding, becoming a legal adult, graduating college, being able to rent a car, being accepted to higher education. It is at these moments, when we are young that we expect to be gifted the deeper understanding we believe "grown ups" to have. Now have gone through all of these milestones I find myself realizing the myth of the grown up to be just that, a myth.

Within my work uncanny characters populate a world that exists in a realm of understanding somewhere between childhood and adulthood, fantasy and reality, naivety and understanding. Working with narrative motifs within this limbo, I explore ideas such as life and death, the banality of everyday life, and spirituality but each theme is expressed through a lens of adolescence.
