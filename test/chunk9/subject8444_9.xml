	<TEXT> Isn't this just like the Joke about "a guy walks into a bar and see a jar full of $10 bills. He asks the bartender what the jar for?

Bartender replies that if he complete three tasks he can take all the money in the jar, but he has to cough up $10 first, before he hears the tasks.

The guy gives the bartender the $10, and ask what are the task. Bartender replies first you have to chug a bottle of tequila, second there is a Rottweiler with a toothache, you have to remove a tooth from the Rottweiler in the back yard, and finally you have to make the 80yr old, who has never come before, orgasm.

The guy grand the bottle of tequila and cigs it all in one gulp. He then goes to the backyard. The patrons all hear the dog growl and bark, and the guy yell. There is a yelp and then silence. 

All the patron looks at each other thinking who would have to go retrieve the body. Right then the door slams open and the guy slurs "where the old lady with the toothache?" Or something like it from last week? </TEXT>
