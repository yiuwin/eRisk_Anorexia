/Jon is actually the OLDEST ACTIVE channel on all of YouTube! The 49 in front of me are all -actually- dead. 

Anyway, that's awesome that you liked my Google+ rant that much! I actually kind of hate that video myself, haha. Poor quality, and poorly-constructed argument. Not my best, but one of my more visible. Picked up a LOT of Twitter followers from that :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It makes sense that you lose views because that's not what your channel exploded with. 

But... I didn't. The channel's *best* three years was the period AFTER Microwave's retirement. Like, I get the point people are making - but NOBODY understands my audience / analytics / career better than me. And by offering advice, you are implying your level of understanding is somehow parallel to my own (whether intentional or not) - and it's something I see as disrespectful and ignorant. 

To be clear, that's the royal 'you' - not speaking to you directly :) </TEXT>

Actually, I saw a nice up-tick in traffic in the three years following Microwave's retirement. 2011-2013 were my best years. As for motivation? Do it for joy and money - and Microwave wasn't providing either. "Movie Night" was WAY more profitable, and much more challenging, creatively. Also gave me time to focus on other shows, too.

As for movie reviews? Might as well just watch my newest from last night, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-ybJ6QquJU - it could use the viewership, haha. Leave a comment, let me know what you think - I still read 'em all :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  it was just a bad idea to completely change your channel's content

And yet, no one complained when I switched from comedy sketches to microwave content. Funny, huh? Jogwheel is, and *always has been* a VARIETY channel. Currently, it's home to five separate shows. When Microwave was running, three or four. When FOX canceled Arrested Development no one accused them of "completely changing" their content - because that doesn't make any fucking sense.

As for your other suggestions? It just proves how misinformed you are - because I already have "separate channels" and I already tried the 'slowed down' schedule as well.

Again. **Thank you for the insight, but I did not ask for it.** </TEXT>

Ding ding ding. But, to your earlier advice, you may not have been implying it was easy, but the fact that you brought it up at all seems to imply that I need to hear it. As if I wasn't already aware of how YouTube works, etc. That's all.

As for Emile - he's an enigma. He has cultivated a VERY particular and loyal fanbase, and has stuck laser-focused to a very particular niche without any wavering. I couldn't do that. I'd be bored and unchallenged.

And, AGAIN, "*you have to find out what algorithm they are currently using and tune your channel to it.*" is MUCH easier said than done.

	<TEXT> Oh, hahahaha. If it only it were that easy! YouTube's algorithms (OneChannel, WatchTime) have crippled my channel's ability to deliver content to those 845,000 subs. Doesn't matter if we came back with some huge Microwave-reunion special, it'd top out at like 20,000 views (which would be way above average these days) - but that's it.

Only way my content gets above 3% viewership anymore is if it gets traction off-site, like Reddit. 

For what it's worth though, I really felt like "Don't Eat The Spam" was my next "unique and interesting" show. It returns with s3 this month, but I don't expect much success. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's been chatter about 'revamping' it since before we announced its retirement. Comes entirely down to resources, and Jory's willingness (he's always been very reluctant to go back to that well). 

As for "The World According To Jon" - the internet has ruined that show for me. Interactions not too dissimilar from this thread have completely killed any desire I have to share my opinion on anything controversial anymore, so I rarely do. That said, I did just do a video on the healthcare bill failure last week, which came out pretty well I thought. </TEXT>

There's no way that formula would be sustainable for that long. It was getting repetitive after 2 years, let alone 10. In the years since its retirement, I've had several videos 'go viral' - none were "Microwave". Despite Reddit's rose-colored glasses, that show just never grabbed large outside audiences (or profit). 

But moreover, TMS still exists - it wasn't deleted. There's 370+ episodes the "kids" of 2017 can, and still do watch it all the time :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jory wanted to retire the show before it became "stale". I pushed for two more seasons (9 and 10), and then we agreed to end it on a high note. The show was tough to produce, expensive, and not creatively fulfilling. And, perhaps most importantly - kept getting flagged / age-restricted by YouTube. And since no sponsor ever wanted to touch the show, it wasn't ever very profitable. And contrary to Reddit's rose-colored glasses, it never went 'viral', either - it took MANY years to build our modest, devoted audience. Moving on seemed like a good move.

I'm glad I tried other things - the years following were by far my most successful. We had a great four years though! 10 year anniversary is coming up soon! </TEXT>

And fewer still realize that it was actually Jory who wanted to end Microwave, not me. He wanted to retire after 8 seasons, I pushed for 2 more. Ultimately, we both agreed it was the right decision. </TEXT>
