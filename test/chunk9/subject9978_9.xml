	<TEXT> While it's hard to tell with all of the changes and the slightly different angle from the other side of the street, this appears to be the exact spot for this photo: https://www.google.com/maps/@38.1011354,-122.255753,3a,75y,95.4h,85.45t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJ9G-MX7kc8kBbyzPWzg_4A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 

Thanks for the help. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help me locate - Photo of a street taken around 1940 in California, USA </TITLE>

	<TEXT> This photo was likely taken around 1940 somewhere in California, USA by my grandparents.  They lived in Vallejo at the time, working in the Naval shipyards, so it might be Vallejo or elsewhere in the Bay area.  I also know they sometimes went down to Los Angeles, so possibly there.  It would be great to pinpoint it for a historic/modern comparison of the street.  My initial searches for some of the businesses with signs didn't come up with anything concrete.  Thanks for any assistance.

	<TEXT> Thanks for the blog post.  Any notes on the data transform you did for GEDCOM to Excel/CSV?  Boiling down a GEDCOM of a couple hundred thousand lines looks like it might take a good bit of work.   </TEXT>
