	<DATE> 2017-03-19 14:50:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have Corsair GS800 Power Supply which I purchased December of 2012 with a 5 year warranty from the online shop. However the company went insolvent and bankrupt so I cant make use of it anymore and Corsair has only a three year warranty for that model on their website which sucks because they know this Power Supply has a lot of problems.

It makes an insanly loud noise when playing games, its not the coilwhine:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjC2YTUsNVg (This is not my video, but it is this buzzing noise except its louder and longer like it doesnt pause like it does in the video which is really annoying)

Edit: Here another video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2GRoZaibMU

So now I need a new Power Supply for my computer but I am wondering: Do I need even 800W? I would appreciaty any help I can get. Thank you so much. Here is m build:


* Windows 10 Pro 64-bit
* ASRock Z77 Extreme3 (CPUSocket)
* Intel Core i5 3570K @ 3.40GHz (Cooling: NZXT Kraken x42)
* 2x 8,00GB Single-Channel DDR3 @ 800MHz = 16 GB
* ATI Radeon RX 480 Graphics (MSI) 8GB
* 1TB SATA
* 250GB SSD 

    
**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

100 Euros (the less the better)

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

Germany

	<TEXT> yeah almost 2 months ago, I got a fin prescription exactly one year ago. I wish I would have started sooner but I took 2 pills last year and started imagining sides (after 2 pills lol i know) because I read only negative horror side effect stories and not even one positive fin comment.

But then I realised this drug probably helped so many people and even if I get sides (which I didnt after 2 months except some watery semen and just a bit lower libido which is not bad IMO) I think my hair is more important </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reviews are pretty good too:

**[Uproxx: Love Returns For Another Uncomfortable, Rewarding Season](http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/love-netflix-season-2-review/)**
 Season twos also a bit more emotionally balanced between the two leads. Mickey is always going to be the more complicated figure  and Jacobs continues to impress with her vulnerability and emotional candor in the role  but there were times last year when Love seemed to be treating Gus as a sympathetic, if neurotic, man getting dragged into an emotional abyss by a woman hes too good for. Late in that season, we started to get signs that Gus is no day at the beach, either  that he can be incredibly judgmental and co-dependent, and that hes largely to blame for the sorry state of his professional and romantic lives. Season two smartly pulls even more on that thread, as Mickey begins to question Guss behavior as her sobriety cheerleader, and Gus has to confront the many flaws hidden beneath the nice guy armor he wears so proudly. The equation has moved from wondering why he puts up with her to wondering if either of them is healthy for the other. Its a smarter, better combination, and the second season is much stronger all around.    


**[Vulture: I like the show Love and sometimes Im not sure why.](http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/love-netflix-season-two-review.html)**

 The thing is, Im kind of a sucker for Sad in California Comedies, even when I can spot their flaws. I appreciate that these people are messy and unpredictable, unlike those in the rom-coms of yore. The fact that they have so much goddamned leisure time to obsess over their messiness while making astute pop-cultural observations serves as a sort of escapism for me. (Who are these people with Saturdays and Sunday Fundays that can be completely improvised? I envy them!) </TEXT>
