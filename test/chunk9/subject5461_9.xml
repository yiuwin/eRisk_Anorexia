	<TEXT> It could have benefited from a more solid script so they weren't improvising for a fair bit, but yeah Ghostbusters was fine overall. And yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and say it, it was definitely more interesting and worth my time than it would have been with a male cast. Look, a Ghostbusters reboot was a bad idea from the word go, because the original only caught fire the way it did because of a very specific set of cultural circumstances in its own time that couldn't be replicated in any other time period. It was lightning in a bottle, but at least the all-female cast has a certain relevance today, where a lot of girls could benefit from seeing positively empowered women in STEM-related fields. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trainwreck was doing that trendy "stealth-drama" thing where it was actually surprisingly heavy considering how it was marketed as a lighthearted comedy (see also: OITNB) but it didn't quite fit the format as well, and as a result the tone was all over the place and I couldn't get invested.

	<TEXT> That is demonstrably untrue, you can absolutely blame society for your particular view of beauty, but not in the way you may think. If you take a look at classic artwork, it's clear that in the old days the ideal feminine beauty from which most artists took their inspiration was very pale and also rather curvaceous. These were characteristics that suggested nobility or aristocracy, as it could be assumed women like that weren't working the fields and could afford the extra food. It wasn't until after the Industrial Revolution and the rise of a middle class that vacations-as-pasttimes and personal trainers became more expensive than shitty fast food, and as a result the rich folks became more slim and more tan, and our standard of beauty did a 180. If you transported, say, Jessica Alba to the Middle Ages, she'd be seen by the people as a pitiable commoner. In other words, what a society considers "beautiful" tends to hang quite a bit on how much money they have. It's incidentally also why knights always seem to be rescuing princesses instead of just any hot chick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wastes is the hardest Barb dungeon, but it's really not anywhere near as difficult as people make it out to be. The monsters all have very long wind-ups and so telegraph their attacks pretty broadly and can be easily stun-locked, which is why the first recommendation is to equip Sprint - Gangway and Ground Stomp - Wrenching Smash. If you keep Sprint up as much as possible (BK set's Fury generation helps immensely) you'll just keep bowling enemies over and they'll never touch you.

Resist the temptation to whirl everywhere you go, because the dust devils will kill off mobs that you might have Rended. Run in normally (using Sprint when you get close to anything, natch), kill off stragglers, and look for a promising cluster of enemies. Pop Sprint, run into the middle of the group, Ground Stomp them all in close, and use Rend - Ravage (the rune that increases the radius), then whirlwind their lights out. With enough DPS they'll be dead before they're even out of the stun. Repeat until you complete the first objective, then consider yourself free to go H.A.M. on everything else in the dungeon.

The dungeon itself is very large and will almost definitely require backtracking, so be sure to equip Furious Charge and have In-Geom in the cube so you can cover distance very quickly. You don't have to worry about the elites' Plagued affix as it's not Physical damage, but the pools will still kill you as quickly as anything else. The swinging pendulum blades *are* physical and will end the dungeon, so be careful of that. Also, I'm not sure if it's a glitch or not but the last time I played it there was a little room in the back that doesn't show up on the minimap. Just be sure to clear that out real fast before moving on.

Finally, be patient. Don't mind taking a few practice runs to get the sequence down pat. If you keep Sprint up then the physical damage becomes a complete non-issue, and Rending enough enemies is just a matter of Ground Stomping the right group. Once you beat Objective 1 you are free to whirl to your heart's content. Your biggest enemy is your own willingness to stick it out to completion, and I get that. But I can personally vouch that it's only difficult enough to be truly satisfying when you beat it :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Within the lore, it's much faster to replace a clip (that receives the majority of the waste heat) than it is to sit and wait for an overheated weapon to be usable again. The clips allow for a more consistent rate of fire on average.

I'll grant you, I wish they'd explored the idea a little more and tweaked the mechanics a bit. For example, if the "capacity" of the magazine is an approximation of how much heat it can store before it needs to discharge, why do individual rounds transfer from clip to clip? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sucker Punch was... interesting. In a nutshell, it was satirizing that particular trope of comic books, fantasy art, and anime where overly fetishized heroines fight in basically two handkerchiefs worth of clothing, with the so-called male gaze theoretically excused by how supposedly "empowered" the protagonists are. In context, those warrior princess/fetish doll action scenes from all the trailers (and presumably what a lot of the audience came to see) were really just a metaphor for the main character doing a striptease for a group of boorish, disgusting monsters... if you caught the implication of that statement, then you just learned exactly why the movie is literally a sucker punch to its own audience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started with a Crusader because Akkhan's set is really interesting for a season start since it works nicely with whatever random crap you find while gearing up. Aside from that, my argument is that it boils down to what you want to accomplish. Both have excellent speedfarming variants, and pushing high GR's depends a great deal on your playstyle. Crusaders can go farther solo but don't have much of a place in group play (Hammerdins are excellent AoE but tend to lag out the game). Demon Hunters make excellent additions to a 4-player team as boss killers, but can't go as far on their own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Wizard really is the Mary Sue of Diablo this season. Best speedfarmer, best DB farmer, best solo progression, arguably best RG killer. At this point they may as well give her strong group healing and crowdpull just so she can be the best support too.

No, I'm not bitter ;)

Edit: *strong healing, auto"correct" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Porque no las dos? I'll have at least two season characters by the end just to knock out two of the conquests. Actually probably three because I'm starting with the Sader and the idea of running the Roland set dungeon again intimidates the hell out of me.

As for which to start with, the starter sets for both classes are versatile and flexible with a wide range of whatever random support items you stumble across in that initial push to your first build, but Akkhan's edges out Marauders for speed so I'm going with Crusader first and starting a DH a bit later. In the end it will all depend on what you have more fun with, though :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd imagine it works like bounty caches. If you complete a T6 bounty and get a cache, then exit the game, start a T13 game, and open that cache, you will receive a T6 bounty's worth of rewards. If you've already received the Gift, the reward is already built in and won't increase just because your circumstances changed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The entire hypothesis is based on a 2002 article by Dwayne McDuffie, who was trying to illustrate a point that it would be patently absurd to hold TV, or any other media, up to the same rigid standard of continuity that comic books have. 

The St. Elsewhere writers weren't really guilty of anything besides failing to realize the internet would be a thing in a few decades and would latch on to their otherwise just kinda silly conclusion and turn it into a 7-car pileup of absurdity. </TEXT>

Beer + Tang. They played it off in the show as a wacky idiosyncrasy but, having tried it it's actually fucking delicious if you use those squirt bottles they have now instead of powder. It works especially well in beers where you would normally add a piece of citrus anyway, but most shitty domestic beers can be made actually tolerable with a sweet, sharp burst of orange flavor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look up Klinefelter syndrome. There are people who are, speaking strictly from a biological perspective, XXY. They are almost invariably male in sex but often produce certain feminine characteristics like enlarged breasts and reduced muscle mass, though they are subtle in some and more pronounced in others.

It turns out that even sex as a chromosomal delineation isn't necessarily binary. It's all very complicated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Developed nations get most of their money from a healthy, well-educated, and productive workforce (as opposed to, say, an important natural resource). So it's in the government's best interest to facilitate a certain standard of its people's welfare because that translates into higher production and a better economic situation. They may not have your best interests in mind, but sometimes your best interests just happen to line up with theirs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Off the top of my head: Illusory Boots are nice, Leoric's Crown, Nemesis Bracers, Oculus Ring, Pride of Cassius (with the max possible roll on Ignore Pain duration). You'll want to roll for cooldown, attack speed, crit chance (not damage), and resource cost, among other defensive stats.

For weapons you have a few options. Istvan's Blades are standard, but those little bastards are rare so some alternatives are the BK set (for Fury generation) or Pig Sticker + Stormshield (for Sword and Board)

Popular cubed items include Solanium (not as mandatory as it was before it was nerfed a couple of seasons back), Chilanik's Chain (similarly optional), and Band of Might (downright mandatory)

All of this stuff is open to lots of other options, this is just what worked for me. </TEXT>
