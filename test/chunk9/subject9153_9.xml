	<TEXT> Yeah I kinda feel like I'm using trash if my cards Super for 100k or less

On the other hand, I'm enjoying seeing bigger numbers, it truly feels like DBZ. 

With double SSJ4 and dupe system my Gogeta hits for a million and I remember when it was just 300k... feels good

But yeah SRs are useless now, I remember being excited for them hitting over 50k </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mono STR became really good with Goku but it still has no tanks and it shows.

I can't beat the SSJ4 Goku event because I waste most of my items against AGL SSJ3 Goku, even with 213k health.

Meanwhile my Villains team clears the event on easy mode.

I kinda feel like I should have given those Elder Kais to Rose and not Goku, to beat the hardest events Villains is the way to go </TEXT>

I used to use him ONLY because of his greatly lowers atk ability. I didn't consider him a real hard-hitter, but he was still one of the most useful units

Now he's one of the best hitters linking with all TURs for some damage, has a chance to become great ape while still being a good card AND still lowers atk </TEXT>

	<TEXT> HOLY RA GUYS 

I just want to note something, I got my PHY Ultra Trunks the lvl 5 DOUBLE ATTACK skill and...

IT STACKS. It sounds kinda obvious, but the second attack has a high chance of being a SA, and it already happened 3 times during my fight against Merged Zamasu

So you use Trunks SA, and he immediatly does another one. So you could possibly get up to 6 bonuses, if the double-attack happened every turn.

At the very least, that skill makes Trunks possibly dish out a lot of damage on one turn, the same would go for Ultimate Gohan.

I think it's relevant to say this since he is PHY, both of them have double-attack as the "free" level 5 skill. Most people won't have dupes so this is an advantage he has over other characters. </TEXT>

I started to play JP yesterday and tried to reroll a bit but only got crap from the banner.

Rerolled until I got yellow Kakashi and then did a multi http://imgur.com/a/HrgNV


Now I can have a team of 3 kakashis, could be 4, (there's a free 4* one) but I have to leave out one. Banner units have a really high cost

	<TEXT> Janemba is so good he's a staple in my mono STR team.

Until STR Perfect Cell, he's the best partner for Omega Shenron, and even with him I would run both probably.

Those 2 linked are my favorite thing, Janemba boosts Omega up to 91k ATK with BBB if there is SS3 GT Goku or Trunks on the same turn, and with Omega's attack reduction Janemba will tank anything

Also, I'm now commited to giving him all my elder kais, since I unlocked the lower right path with my only dupe but he's only SA 2. Gotta go full retard on him </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Arale would want to play with him because he looks bored, just like Boros could see Saitama like a badass, she'll see him with a cartoony bored face just like we do, and if he's in a good mood that day he'll accept without knowing what she meant.

Next he knows, she is throwing him around like a ragdoll until he is forced to get serious. Arale still laughs it off asking about those funny faces he does when serious.

I don't see him punching her but he'll play with her using his best moves and she'll keep up, both will finally be happy because they are both using their powers against someone equally strong.

They'll probably jump to other planets for fun until Arale runs out of gas and he wonders if Genos could get this strong.

The chapter ends with Saitama telling the story to King while they play videogames, he says something like "Oh man, I sure hope to find someone else who can beat me", King quickly wins and Saitama starts throwing a tantrum ignoring that King is his true rival

	<TEXT> It was brilliant, in a Hitler kind of way, it is inspiring for people who are feeling down and looking for something to get pumped up.

It's hard for some to appreciate it now because you already know how it ended, but his ideas are actually shared by a LOT of young guys, I know it reached me.

Of course, he was an idiot, if you investigate him you know he was socially retarded, but you can identify with the sentiment.

It is about isolation despite your best efforts, and stuck up girls who just won't give you a chance. That's very common even if it sounds cringy. There needs to be some kind of retribution, but he went a little too far with it, that's all.

He created a masterpiece and then betrayed it, because he didn't even kill those stuck-up bitches he hated so much or the jocks, he was aimlessly firing and killed people who had nothing to do with it.

It was a bad execution, but you can separate his deeds from the manuscript and just appreciate the text.

It's so motivating reading about his pain, you just know those are sincere feelings from the bottom of his heart. It just echoes into a lot of us, those were some fine views he had. Except that he was more about getting laid than actually getting a girlfriend, but I can overlook that and imagine he wanted a gf. </TEXT>

It doesn't defeat the purpose I think, it's just 1 per month and you still need to farm orbs, you're not getting a huge boost BUT you can at least participate in the system.

	<TEXT> If my analysis is correct, Eis should be a mono-int (maybe villain) staple and extremely overpowered for a free unit.

You can farm his dupes, so he's able to learn any skill, not a problem. His passive is to reduce -20% attack EACH TIME HE ATTACKS, NOT JUST ON SUPER.

You could easily max his double-attack skill and he'd be almost consistently reducing 40% attack to a target, as long as his passive works twice the same turn.

I don't know how high the chance is, but I remember someone saying that with a level 5 dodge his Buuhan was dodging pretty often.

To it, of course, you can add that Eis would be getting +3000 in every stat, so that leaves him at Janemba tier with farmable super.

This is too good in theory, only problem is getting all them orbs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A better comparison would be the God leaders.

When they came out, Bandai started creating Dokkan fests assuming that you had at least 70% ATK/DEF/HP and 3 ki. 

You could stomp previous content so it got harder.

Now Bandai may assume that your characters have +5000 stats, attack multiple times per turn, are super effective vs anyone and can dodge.

And things will get ugly if they assume that </TEXT>
