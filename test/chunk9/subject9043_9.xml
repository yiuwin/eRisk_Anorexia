	<TEXT> A lot of the territorial changes were made due to ethnicity or past holds. The fish-hook you refer to is Alsace Lorraine, which the Germans took of France in 1871. Another example is Transylvania, which was given to Romania because of a large Romanian speaking population. A lot of it was to give independence to states under what Woodrow Wilson called 'self determination', so the birth of an Independent Poland, which had ceased to be at the end of the 18th century and as well for other nations.
Other reasons for the breakup was to prevent European hegemony that wasn't part of the Entente, to ensure world peace under the League of Nations, thus the dissolution of AH and the Ottomans.
Hope this helped, any other questions, just ask. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why shouldn't I be proud of the way I am? It doesn't have to be your achievement if you want to be proud about something. 
Sure I get irked at the stereotype that we are all flamboyant and wear nothing but rainbow coloured shirts and can't go three minutes without sticking something in our butt, but that's a stereotype created by prejudices and Pride Parades are a way of displaying the individuality of us.
It's a way of showing we're equal and just like you. Homophobia is still an big issue all over the world and the cooperation and friendship at these parades help end these kind of issues.
But that's just my view. If you're bothered to read this, give me your opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right we're in for a story.
Spain PU's and then integrates France. Netherlands and allies cause Spain and Spanish France to explode into the mess you see before you. Rebels everywhere. Now Britain had lost Calais to France before the PU, but then lost a War and was forced to
release France in Calais alone. French rebels in Spain lead to Spanish France being ceded to Calais France. This is the outcome. </TEXT>
