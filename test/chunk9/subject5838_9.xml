	<TEXT> It's okay to send a friendly reminder or two, I do it all the time with Amazon.  If I get a notification like that and I'm not at a computer, I won't do it.  But if I get one later and I happen to be, then I do!  And if people don't want to..they just ignore it. :) Hope this helps, good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, you have great pics.  Good photography is a great start (and necessity) for any successful shop.  I would suggest that the high views and low sales is a result of not yet having 'established' your business on Etsy.  Your first few sales are VITAL.  Don't be upset if you don't make money on these - actually, it may be beneficial to gift or severely reduce your margin *just to get feedback*.  Your future customers want to know that they're buying a reliable product - and the best way to earn their trust is by the word of other consumers.  You may even consider having your facebook customer checkout through etsy (if they're fam/friends) using a coupon or "other" method of payment just so they can leave you feedback.  View it as a marketing expense.  Your sales should begin to pickup from there.  Good luck!

	<TEXT> Hi ladies,
We had a great turnout last night at diebolt and (temporarily) owned the shit out of the trivia night.  *Let's not talk about the 3 subsequent rounds.*  What I want to know is, what are your suggestions for future meetups?  Things to do?  Different places to go?  (more central)?  The only reason I've been picking areas on the north side are to make it more convenient to me because I have to commit to being there (ha) but if anyone wants to take the reigns, heyyoo!! :)  Another question - should we make more admins for the facebook group?  As in, everyone?  I want this to be as welcoming as possible and I kinda fell ass-backwards into this modding thing.  Looking forward to your suggestions!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed, I don't think it's cheating either.  I used to turn in assignments in French 101 that were proofread by native speakers.  I would write terribly, as expected for a beginner.  When I would go through them, I would learn why what I wrote was wrong, and fix it.  My teacher always raised an eyebrow because I turned in flawless written work, but she probably doubted some French speaker would waste their time writing "My name is xxx. I like the color red. The weather is nice." etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last year, I made 2 submissions to r/picrequests and printed 'em up.  [Original](http://imgur.com/jLuZieN) and [After](http://imgur.com/bXuirCQ).  Another [original](http://imgur.com/TNlRuJR) and [After #1](http://i.imgur.com/hIe5VCE.jpg) and [After #2](http://i.imgur.com/M1onjQ8.jpg).

It was the hit of both family parties.  Thank you for that.  These pics are for the best parents that I know.  Their kids are so wonderful.  Anyway, I was hoping that someone could change [this image of my nephew](http://i.imgur.com/sppL82c.jpg) to look like the pic of [Putin shirtless on a horse](http://beforeitsnews.com/contributor/upload/5385/images/Putin_Horse.jpg_w300h298.jpg).


Secondarily, I kind of want to do something of a Superhero theme with [this image](http://i.imgur.com/ZlJ7TsP.jpg) or a Breaking Bad theme with [both boys](http://i.imgur.com/wP05EXI.jpg).  Thanks [r/picrequests](http://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests), even if I receive no responses, I very much appreciate the laughs you gave my family last year! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Alright ladies. The time has come. I have switched jobs and now have a little wiggle room for planning (and attending) social events.  Here's the plan for the next get together:


Date: Tues, Dec. 2.  I don't want to fuck with T-giving week.

Time: 6pm

Where: [Odyssey Beerwerks](http://www.odysseybeerwerks.com/), 5535 W 56th Ave #107, Arvada, CO 80002

Who:  YOU!  Come out and meet some fellow ladies of Denver whether you're new to the city or you've lived here your whole life, it doesn't matter.

Food: Currently asking about a food truck.


I will take it upon myself to show up a little early to grab a spot and I'll let the hosts know what the hell we're doing. See y'all there at 6p. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doing my due diligence of posting, as a couple people are in the midst of travels/airplaning/in transit to Denver.

Who: Anyone and everyone. (This is all ages!)

What: Board games, card games, alcohol and more games. 

Where: [Strange Craft](http://strangecraft.com/) at 1330 Zuni St.

When: Wed, Nov 12th, from 6:00pm until they make us leave.

Why: Catan, Munchkin, Ticket to Ride, Flux, Dominion, and any other fun games you want to bring. If you need more convincing: meeting new people and tasty beer!
First-timer Info: Maybe you're in town visiting, maybe you just recently moved here and wanna meet new people, or maybe you've been seeing this posted week after week and finally decided to come; whatever your reason for showing up your first time, WELCOME! Seriously, we're glad to have new people show up, more people means more players and more players means we get to play more games, something we all love. Don't sweat it if you don't know any boardgames besides monopoly either, we love teaching our awesome games to people. So feel free to show up, and when you do, walk right up to any group playing games and introduce yourself, ask questions about whats being played and get involved! See ya tonight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. The comments here make 5'11" seem small.  So I don't write much, but I relate to so many of the posts because I'm called *tall* every god damned day.

..I also often wear heels to boost me up to 6'3".  So maybe the comments are warranted.  Ha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi ladies!  Just wanted to let you know that despite this community being a little inactive, I am planning to schedule a ladies meetup mid-November.  

Other things worth mentioning:
r/denver has a hiking group [on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1457346744519652/)

r/denver also has its game group [on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/rDenverGameNight/)

I'm posting those two because I can vouch for them.  Game nights are the shit, there's never any pressure on the newbies (or women) and for the most part, the regulars are going above and beyond to be welcoming.  I'm usually there too (Mallory) or our other mod [u/deviatednorm](http://www.reddit.com/user/deviatednorm)

Have a pleasant Thursday and hope to see some of your lovely faces soon! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there! You are correct!  This is from their shop.  When I bought directly from them, I sold on Etsy (they are aware, I asked permission before purchasing).  They raised their prices significantly so I want another vendor for a different, similar product.  *I know that my marketshare does not overlap with theirs at all and I have no intention to directly compete.*  That would be rude and they're a very nice couple.  There are other shops that do weed soaps.  They do not have exclusivity on this product.  I want to capitalize on the growing culture and nature of the product, like many others. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In case the other post wasn't interpreted as intended, in all seriousness, [r/denverwomen](http://www.reddit.com/r/denverwomen) was created in order to create a safe environment for ladies to express their thoughts or needs and find similarly minded ladies in the city.  It stands to reason that most redditors are men, but we want to show that our proud city does have a group of internet women that would enjoy the company of fellow ladies.  This is our 2nd meetup, and we don't want to scare off anyone who shows by having a random dude chilling in the background. Thanks for understanding. :) </TEXT>
