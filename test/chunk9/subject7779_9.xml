I do have PS4, n3DS XL and plan on purchasing Switch around 2018 depending on the game library. As of now, the only games that I wanna play for Switch are Splatoon 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought my Sony Xperia C5 Ultra last November 2015. Two weeks ago I accidentally dropped my phone and it landed on it's side and hit the metal part of my table stand. Now looks like this. http://imgur.com/EYLjthx

I went to a Sony Xperia store and told me that it would take around 9k to replace the whole LCD. Went to Greenhills Theater Mall and told me that it would cost at 3k. I know it's cheaper in Greenhills but the part is not original and may not even stand very long. Is it worth to buy a new one instead? My target phone now is Huawei GR5 (2017). I'm not in a rush to buying a new one since I'm used to that black sludge on my phone.

	<TEXT> I agree! When I was in my high school days, I really wanted both brands to merge. When RAW vs Smackdown happened I got happy seeing both roster going at it. Then as weeks go by my interest goes down then eventually stopped watching.

Then one day mid 2016, I saw WWE on my Facebook feed streaming their pre-shows. When I saw the second brand split I got more curious and decided to start watching wrestling again. Up to this day I'm still impressed that WWE made the right decision on their brand split. It's a 50-50 win both fans and wrestlers since they are also given a chance to showcase their talent.

I really hope they do one crossover in an annual basis like what they did for Survivor Series 2016.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I accidentally dropped my phone and it landed on the metal part of my table stand on the side part of the phone. Now it has this *black smudge* on its LCD. I went to the store where I bought it and they told me the estimate of the LCD replacement would be around 9k. However, they did suggest that I should go directly to the service center in Pasig to have them check it out and they may have a different price for it.

My phone BTW is Sony Xperia C5 Ultra. I bought it last November 2015. If the repair price is still big, I consider buying a new one. I'm thinking between Huawei and Xiaomi. Although if you guys have any suggestions please do tell me. My budget for a new one is less than 15k. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a 'Tales of' veteran since Tales of Destiny 2 PS1 (which turns out to be Tales of Eternia). Tales of Berseria is a huge improvement comparing to Tales of Zestiria. Although Tales of Vesperia (Xbox 360) is still my number 1. 

Lore wise, Tales of Berseria is a prequel to Tales of Zestiria but 1000 years apart. I did not play Tales of Zestiria because I did not like the battle mechanic and I've read from /r/Tales that it's not that good. Just watch Tales of Zestiria anime then play Tales of Berseria. </TEXT>

Don't get me wrong, the song is good especially when I heard it for the first time but if it's being played more then two to three times in a daily basis nakakasawa LOL! Ito na ata yung kapalit ng All of Me and Thinking Out Loud.

	<TEXT> 3DS owner here! Well previously 2DS but upgraded now to New 3DS XL! It's fun! Games that I have right now are Pokemon Y, Pokemon Omega Ruby, Pokemon Sun, Mario Kart 7, and Super Smash Brothers for 3DS. Also when Nintendo eShop accepts Philippine based Credit Card I got a digital copy of Dr. Mario Miracle Cure and Donkey Kong Country 2 for nostalgia purposes.

Also there are plenty of 3DS Streetpass meetup around Metro Manila. Usually once or twice every week there are 3DS group who gets together and play all day. Check out Pinoy 3DS in FB for more info. Fortunately there is a group near from where I live. Made new friends and learned more about competitive Pokemon Battle back in 2014. I still do it but I'm distracted to my PS4 LOL! </TEXT>

Final Fantasy IX is still my favorite of all the Final Fantasies that I played but honestly, I still have no idea on how Sir Fratley had an amnesia when during the his departure from Burmecia.

 Did Vivi die? 

Yes he did. Black Mages in FFIX only have limited life span as it was explained when you arrived in the Black Mage Village.

 How did Zidane come back?

To be honest, I also had no idea how he did survive from the crazed Iifa tree. Well my theory is maybe Kuja may have something to do with it since they're the only ones in the core of the tree. Kuja was dying and maybe thought of spending his remaining life to somehow save Zidane.  </TEXT>
