	<TEXT> As for the Mckayla Maroney story, I honestly don't know what the big deal is, like why is it that she is obligated to act accordingly to what a good role model for little girl does? 

Also if these young girls who supposedly look up to her grow up to take pictures of their bodies  themselves when they are legal adults, then so what? Is that such a big deal? Like she is an incredibly good looking woman who is confident in herself and has agency over her own body, why is that a bad image? These ideas about modesty are so outdated and boring, they just need to die, nobody is going to benefit of the shaming of young women.  </TEXT>

Like why insist on making baseless claims when you can just say that you don't like him? It is perfectly okay to just say "I don't listen to his music" and move on

Why insist on make a claim that you have admitted to not knowing enough about? So no I don't know, because you're making zero sense... because him being a shitbag isn't valid criticism of anything but his actions, it might be off putting and a reason you don't wanna listen to him, but it is not a solid argument about his musicianship.  </TEXT>

Like this one? And what is the issue here, showing up uninvited or the number of people who does it? Because it seems like this is a case of "it is only wrong when other people do it". 

From what I understand this sub is about people who pretend to know a lot about metal, even though they allegedly don't... and if you want to do that then that is fine, but that doesn't make it not shit talking.
I am not saying you are bad people, but this sub this doesn't exactly reek of positivity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man this PWR BTTM thing is getting crazy, I don't think I've ever seen a band fall this hard this quickly, now they've been dropped by Polyvinyl and their music is getting removed from iTunes and Spotify... like I don't think I have ever seen this much of an reaction to rape allegations ever. I wonder why it took of too such an extent this time, because usually it at least takes more than a week for all of this to go down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In December 1793, he was arrested and was taken to Luxembourg Prison in Paris. While in prison, he continued to work on The Age of Reason (179394). Future President James Monroe used his diplomatic connections to get Paine released in November 1794. He became notorious because of his pamphlets The Age of Reason, in which he advocated deism, promoted reason and free thought, and argued against institutionalized religion in general and Christian doctrine in particular. He also published the pamphlet Agrarian Justice (1797), discussing the origins of property, and introduced the concept of a guaranteed minimum income. In 1802, he returned to the U.S. where he died on June 8, 1809. Only six people attended his funeral as he had been ostracized for his ridicule of Christianity.

Just googled him, he seemed like an interesting dude, although ahead of his time.
