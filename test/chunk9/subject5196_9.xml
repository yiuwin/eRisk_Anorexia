Relevant part: 
 The White House response is that hes not going to release his tax returns, said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, during an appearance on ABCS This Week with George Stephanopoulos. We litigated this all through the election.

People didnt care, Conway added. They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are  are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like. </TEXT>

Third pen: packed. Fourth: left side full, right side very sparsely populated. The sixth is pretty hard to tell from the flat perspective, but looks about as full as it does in the overhead picture.

	<TEXT> I enjoyed their election night coverage.  The panel commentary as the night went on gave me some encouragement.  I can't remember the gentlemen's name, now, the one that went on that really epic rant towards the end of the evening, but that was a really special moment for me, when I realized that some people were not going to keep their mouths shut and were still going to try to keep the sanity in news.  

My problem with CNN is just the speculation on unfolding events (something all 24-hour news channels are guilty of), and the insane use of graphics (though I admit most of the time, I'm a fiend for those).  

I'll try to pay more attention in the coming months/years and see what I can get out of it.  I try to be a local news watcher when at all possible, and read as much as I can online (where I can fact-check fairly easily). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm just getting started with all of this. This week I decided to kick myself into gear using Tofugu's "30 Days of Becoming A Better Japanese Learner" to try to formulate better habits. 

In conjunction with that, I've tested a few new study methods, including learning, fully learning, 4 new Kanji a day. It's not a lot, but it's a quick start. I've never been good about learning everything about a kanji in all my years of study, so I'm backtracking now to fix that. 

I'm also using Tofugu's 4500 sentences book to work harder on studying translation. 

Next Week I will be more firmly implementing these efforts as daily routine. My goal is to learn 20 kanji soundly, write on Lang-8 4 times, and get 30 more sentences translated. I'm also reteaching myself radicals as a warm-up, and plan to finish that memrize deck by week's end.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Finished this evening, and boy... Did this book make me feel some things. 

Combined with watching When Harry Met Sally on NYE (long explanation), I came to the very strong realization that I'm finally ready to start a family. It was the Happiness Machine that did me in, but the stuff that followed about memories and growing old just shook me up in a way that's hard to describe. 

I've never really had a book make me feel something in this way. It's crazy. I love it. Thank you all so much for the recommendation and votes!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, now I remember what happened.  During the commercial break, while he was getting booed, he stopped reading the list and started off listing reasons why Chicago sucked, which really got the crowd going, it was pretty fun, then when they returned from break, he picked up the list at the end as though he'd gone through the whole thing.  

I was 10 years old when I went to this and it was pretty much right before my parents got divorced, so it's kind of this cool bittersweetesque memory.  Made me really happy to see the video, though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Has Jericho always been a fan of lists?  I didn't know he had a thing going right now, but it piqued a memory I had of the only WCW show I went to, back when I was a kid.  I knew one of the wrestlers read off a list of all of the things that sucked about Chicago, or something like that.  Anyways, I went to find the event to see if it was Jericho, because that was who I remembered it being, and sure enough, he was on that card at least.  

Jesus, that was in 1998. </TEXT>

From Amazon: 
When Babbitt was first published in 1922, fans gleefully hailed its scathing portrait of a crass, materialistic nation; critics denounced it as an unfair skewering of the American businessman. Sparking heated literary debate, Babbitt became a controversial classic, securing Sinclair Lewiss place as one of Americas preeminent social commentators.

Businessman George F. Babbitt loves the latest appliances, brand names, and the Republican Party. In fact, he loves being a solid citizen even more than he loves his wife. But Babbitt comes to resent the middle-class trappings he has worked so hard to acquire. Realizing that his life is devoid of meaning, he grows determined to transcend his trivial existence and search for greater purpose. Raising thought-provoking questions while yielding hilarious consequences, and just as relevant today as ever, Babbitts quest for meaning forces us to confront the Babbitt in ourselvesand ponder what it truly means to be an American. </TEXT>

I thought maybe I'd start taking the train since it takes the same amount of time to get home via train (1 hour, 15 minutes), but because it also takes that long to GET to work in the morning, it's simply miserable.  </TEXT>
