I got fed up one day with the shitty songs blaring on speakers when I forgot to bring my noise-cancelling earphones in and decided to plug my ipod in.

Best decision ever made, as everybody appreciated my song choices of [SYNTHWAVE   TRAP](https://soundcloud.com/swapnil-jain-94).

	<TEXT> Most Indian masala movies have similar convoluted plotlines with some exception these days with Independent movie-makers getting some spotlight in last few years in Bollywood.

But, I would think that Quentin is a lover of good cinema and the lead actor of this movie, Kamal Hassan is one of the best actors in India.

His movie [Pushpak](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251355/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_64) is one of my favorites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this just happened,

I was riding my scooter @ slow cruising speed down the main street of nearby colony(one of the biggest residential colony in Asia) with an empty road in front of me as it's pretty late in the evening.

It's a narrow road with a divider in middle with room for only bus sized vehicle to pass at a time on one side, so the smaller vehicles like my scooter are forced to stock to left side of road.

Now, this white hatchback appears from nowhere and starts honking at me for no goddamn reason at all.

Clearly he had room to pass through. But, the cunt of a fatherless driver decides to ram me as I was preparing to give him more room to pass through. 

It was a minute nudge on my plastic bumper, but I felt it.

I was furious as I saw cigarette smoking middle-aged pedo-look having blob sitting in the driver seat signaling me to move out of the way through my rear view.

I was about to stop my scooter and confront him, then I remembered my mom's words to never talk to a greasy old stranger on a dark isolated part of town, and also that revenge is dish best serve hot..

So, I decided what a sane person would do in that situation and have him tailgate my ass for the whole 10 kilometres of the road with no exit in sight(small roads, smaller exits).

Finally my street came up and I turned for my hood entrance, whilst giving him the finger.

The whole ordeal lasted half an hour with some stops along the way where I stopped abruptly so he could get out of his car profusely sweating and shouting obscene remarks about ending my existence as I repeatedly drove away while he struggled to get back in his mini car to begin chasing me again.

**TL;DR** Asshole driver honks at me and ram my scooter, I let him tailgate me for what he must have felt like eternity while playing goose chase with him. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So this just happened,

I was riding my scooter @ slow cruising speed down the main street of nearby colony(one of the biggest residential colony in Asia) with an empty road in front of me as it's pretty late in the evening.

It's a narrow road with a divider in middle with room for only bus sized vehicle to pass at a time on one side, so the smaller vehicles like my scooter are forced to stock to left side of road.

Now, this white hatchback appears from nowhere and starts honking at me for no goddamn reason at all.

Clearly he had room to pass through. But, the cunt of a fatherless driver decides to ram me as I was preparing to give him more room to pass through. 

It was a minute nudge on my plastic bumper, but I felt it.

I was furious as I saw cigarette smoking middle-aged pedo-look having blob sitting in the driver seat signaling me to move out of the way through my rear view.

I was about to stop my scooter and confront him, then I remembered my mom's words to never talk to a greasy old stranger on a dark isolated part of town, and also that revenge is dish best serve hot..

So, I decided what a sane person would do in that situation and have him tailgate my ass for the whole 10 kilometres of the road with no exit in sight(small roads, smaller exits).

Finally my street came up and I turned for my hood entrance, whilst giving him the finger.

The whole ordeal lasted half an hour with some stops along the way where I stopped abruptly so he could get out of his car profusely sweating and shouting obscene remarks about ending my existence as I repeatedly drove away while he struggled to get back in his mini car to begin chasing me again.

**TL;DR** Asshole driver honks at me and ram my scooter, I let him tailgate me for what he must have felt like eternity while playing goose chase with him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After tucking their three-year-old child Sammy in for bed one night, his parents heard sobbing coming from his room. Rushing back in, they found him crying hysterically.

He managed to tell them that he had swallowed a penny and he was sure he was going to die.

No amount of talking was helping. His father, in an attempt to calm him down, palmed a penny from his pocket and pretended to pull it from Sammy's ear. Sammy was delighted.

In a flash, he snatched it from his father's hand, swallowed it, then cheerfully demanded, "Do it again, Daddy, do it again!!!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in Jaipur, India and it's already starting to reach temperatures upto 38 degrees this week only.

April, may and June are hardest to cope with.

My house is south facing with sun hitting front, sides and roof from dawn till dusk.

It gets pretty hot indoors and I'm thinking if putting gravel on the roof this month and also doing a coat of white paint on side walls of the house.

Will it help?
