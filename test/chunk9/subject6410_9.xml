	<TEXT> Agreed entirely. Yavin was  super interesting because it introduced a lot of us to the concept of very ancient cultures in a very futuristic universe (appealing to the inner historian within me as well as the scifi fan). I think ive never felt more immersed in the Star Wars universe than when i sent Kyle through the academy's training grounds. A lot of people like you and I probably felt ourselves becoming knights when we finally force pulled that lightsaber out of the cage at the end of the mission.

While it is disappointing that the Yavin academy is no longer canon, i do appreciate that in Rogue 1, Jedha is almost an exact copy of the Valley of the Jedi. It feels promising that the producers of future star wars content will bring us plenty of ancient jedi lore in future (and hopefully expand that of Yavin). As for Luke, i suspect his "mobile academy" will take us to places like Yavin and perhaps other exciting locations too.

	<TITLE> Did the followers of Mithras, Sol Invictus, Serapis and other late Greco-Roman deities surpass those of the traditional gods in numbers prior to the time of Constantine? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> [This wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism) gives an excellent overview of how newer religious and philosophical movements increased in popularity within the Roman empire from the 1st century onwards but doesnt really mention to what extent. Do we know if by the time of the 4th century, worship of the traditional Greek/Roman pantheon was nearly extinct? Or was practicing these new forms of religion merely seen as an extension of traditional paganism (eg Mithras or Sol invictus just seen as another Olympian)?

Tldr version: was Zeus and co still "popular" gods before Christianity became the dominant religion?

	<TEXT> Some possibilities include:

* Die prior to the battle of Yavin. 
* Die before or during the OT period (between the battle of Yavin and the battle of Endor.
* Survive past the battle of Endor.
* Survive past the battle of Jakku but die prior to the time of Bloodline or TFA. (this would be roughly similar to the events in Legends)
* Survive past the time of TFA


Personally, i would like to see him survive till after the battle of Jakku but im not sure exactly what his role would be within the First Order. What do you think? is it a good idea to have  Thrawn active in the time of a cold war between the FO and the NR? or is Thrawn better suited in a setting where the FO (or Empire) is in direct conflict with the NR?

	<TEXT> Some Greek philosophers could be considered atheist to the extent that they rejected the only known gods in Greek society. Some could include Socrates, Diagoras and Philodemus. Look them up for further details.

Interestingly, according to wikipedia, the term "atheist" was applied to Christians who rejected the Roman gods. Perhaps its worth noting that when looking through sources for evidence of "atheists" in the past, one should not be mislead by applying the modern meaning to the word.

	<TITLE> Are there any good books which cover how the Roman Republic conquered and absorbed the Hellenistic kingdoms? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi all
Im trying to paint myself a picture on how the Romans invaded and absorbed the kingdoms and states of the Greek world. Till now, ive had to resort to multiple books about general hellenistic history where the topic is discussed but not to the extent that i would like.

The way the Romans came to rule the Hellenistic world was a gradual process that took place over 2 centuries and in pieces. It would be nice to have a book which traced this gradual process from start to finish and which includes all the various people, factions and alliances involved.

So can anyone recommend a good book on this topic? 
cheers  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think its pretty obvious its Luke. I would say that the title "the last Jedi" is in reference to him being the last of the old Jedi. His future students will be the "first of the new".

There is little doubt in my mind that Luke will survive through episode 8 and 9. You cannot have a Skywalker saga without an actual Skywalker and if we are to see any continuity in the story between the OT and the ST, we will see Luke make an effort to re-establish the order as per Yoda's instructions

	<TEXT> Correct but the knights of ren are like 7 or so individuals.. I don't think having 7 lightsabers will reduce the amount of impact they have in the film.  Remember Grievous is one character and he had 4!

	<TEXT> I tried the Imperial Shuttle one... it did not go too well.
Half way through the instructions and i broke one of the pieces by bending it too much. Tried to super glue it back on but that made it worse though.

So when i mean well done that you made this, i really mean it. Good job!

	<TEXT> In my opinion Rogue One is far superior as a movie than the Force Awakens. 
What i think it did better than TFA was the Space battles, the Jedi lore, the lightsaber scenes and the new planets. These are typically what i look forward to in SW films.

TFA  no doubt had better character development than R1 but i think is only a minor complaint considering that all the main characters die at the end of the film. </TEXT>
