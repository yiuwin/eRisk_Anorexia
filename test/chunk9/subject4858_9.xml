	<TEXT> Thanks for the info. I have a great CPA but he doesn't do stuff like this, and says he doesn't know one who does. However, I do have a couple contacts who might be of value. Thanks for the info! Our business has grown like crazy the last year, and it generated quite a bit of cash, but we also spent a ton on big chunks of inventory and upgrades etc that took a bite out of our profits, so maybe I should re-think this year's strategy and try for valuation in a year </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good point. I suspect it's not worth much, but I am curious to know what I could ask. The next question is where/how to sell, but that's another post for another day. I'll look into finding a ratio like you mentioned, thank you </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry if wrong sub. I am more curious than anything how I might know if my business has any value for selling. Would I just find a local accounting firm who does things like this? Anyone with experience? Thanks in advance! </TEXT>
