	<TEXT> Leave HER alone and move on. 
Try someone else. 
This is pointless. 
You will have a pathetic response to everything I say. 
You're like a teenage girl who thinks no one knows or understands her problems, but we've all got them. 
I have extreme social anxiety that makes talking to ANYONE a crippling experience. If there was a girl I was attracted to, talking to her was my biggest nightmare. 
I could have blamed the girl for being intimidating. 
I could have blamed my anxiety for making me inept. 
But I chose to take hold of my fears and conquer them. 
You're just a coward hiding behind fear and anxiety because of some invisible "comfort zone" that isn't even that comfortable. AND YOU KNOW IM RIGHT. 
Face your fear of rejection and better yourself. 
Go to the gym and better your body. 
Do what you can to make yourself more comfortable in your own skin.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then be alone your whole life and suffer. 
I swear you're pathetic. 
You can't complain about something while simultaneously NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. 
What's even funnier is that you think you have to be tall and attractive and have a good job to get a girl, but I am below average height, and I don't have a great job, yet I have a wonderful fianc who loves me because I took the time to get to know her and worked hard at a relationship with her. 
That's what you are missing. Relationships aren't easy. 
They don't happen in a day. You can't get frustrated and give up, because that is a true turn off for women. 
Girls want you to fight for them, just like men want their women to fight for them.

	<TEXT> Well that's her choice. 
It's not like you can just find an ugly chick and ask her and she has to say yes. 
Are you really going to give up because of rejection? 
Life is full of rejection. You have to move past it to better yourself. 
LOWER YOUR STANDARDS.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow. It's sad that you get this response so often that you have to have an auto-mod to answer people who try to talk sense into you. 
Quit blaming everyone else for your shitty life. 
Instead of rubbing infinite loads into infinite socks while you imagine having sex with a girl you could never get, go find any other girl that is of equal attraction and be nice to her. Talk to her. DONT treat her like a piece of meat. 
Men don't own women. Women can choose their mates just like we can choose. 
Just because you're ugly and people picked on you your whole life doesn't make you worthless. 
Go find love. 
Not sex. 
Love. 
Stop idolizing women who are out of everyone's league. 
LOWER YOUR FUCKING STANDARDS.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why don't you ask a nice unattractive girl on a date? 
You know that there are girls who feel the same as you right? 
The behavior that you are complaining about is the exact same behavior you are exhibiting. 
You're mad because women only like "model guys", but you only like "model girls" 
If you want to go on a date or get fucked, ask out a girl who is actually in your league. 
If you're a 3, date 3-5. 
Lower your standards and cut out all of this inferiority complex bull shit. 
I bet you could get fucked TONIGHT if you did that. 
That's all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't think I said that either... 
did you read my reply at all? 
All I was trying to say is that no one can know for sure because we can't actually communicate with dogs or animals in general. 
After raising and training over 100 cats and dogs in my childhood, I have seen that they do have emotions. They may not be the exact same as human emotions, but they are there. 
I may be wrong, but I might also be right. 
I'm willing to bet you're not going read this reply either and assume what my argument is based off of other arguments you've had in the past about this subject. (Because that's how arguments work

	<TEXT> Yea he's a great comedian and he writes really well, but every talk show interview I've seen with him, the host sets him up with a question and he does a bit from his comedy specials. That's all.
That totally breaks the illusion for me. 
Part of what makes him funny to me is that he sounds like he's just talking to the audience off the top of his head, but this shows that it's all rehearsed like crazy. 
I know that almost all comedians rehearse the hell out of their sets, but it's about the illusion. 
At least have some jokes that were specifically written for the talk show. 
Other than that tiny, tiny flaw, I love him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, if a dog eats weed, he could get really really sick. 
It depends on how much they eat and how big they are but it can happen. 
Your little doggo will look drunk and will fall all over the place. 
I thought my dog was dying but when we took him to the vet, he said "Umm, it looks like your dog has ingested marijuana."
I said "oh... uhhh maybe he ate a roach when we went to the park...." 
he retorted with "It would've had to been way more than a roach, and since you know what a roach is im assuming it was yours."
I asked him how he knew what a roach was and he let out a "eeeehhhhhhhh... you got me"
We fist bumped and then he told me to be more careful. 
TL;DR: dogs digest weed differently than humans  </TEXT>

You could have given the same bullshit advice in two sentences, instead of going on a rant. 
People post here wanting critiques because they KNOW they need to practice, but they aren't really sure what to practice or they want to know specific ways they can improve certain things. 
Not to be told that they shouldn't ask for a critique and to draw more. 
That's obvious.

Just make sure to really focus your practice on the goals you want to achieve 
Have a day where your practice isn't structured and just draw whatever you feel like

	<TEXT> Wow! Thanks so much! 
I really didn't expect that response! 
My eventual goal is to be a tattoo artist, so it feels good for someone to say I have a unique style. 
You just made my day, and you're awesome for that! 
What you said made me confident enough to start posting on here more!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, no. 
It's hair. Hair is not living. It doesn't hurt your cat to cut it. Actually most like it, specially if the cat gets clumps often. Tangles can hurt a cat pretty badly because their skin is more delicate, so shaving the cat is the better choice if brushing daily doesn't stop the tangles from forming.
