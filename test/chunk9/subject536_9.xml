	<TITLE> Some low calorie sweets you all might enjoy! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I found this stuff called "Zevia", it's a non gmo certified, zero calorie soda sweetened with Reb A (stuff from stevia leaves I think), 4g of erythritol per serving, and monk fruit! It's delicious, curbs my sweets cravings, and it's guilt free! You all should try some! Anyone else know of anything similar? Preferably without sucrulose, aspartame, sorbitol, or larger amounts of erythritol? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People who believe they have superior intelligence who automatically assume they are the smartest and most driven in the room. I guess truly smart people can pull that attitude off, but most people that arrogant just look like dipshits. I can't stand the type of people who blame their social flaws, lack of friends, and empty sex life on the fact that they are "so intelligent" that no one understands them. It's pathetic.
I hate people who expect you to always know what they are thinking when they suck at expressing what they think.
I hate people who let their anger get the best of them when they can't get their way, it's really childish to me. I think a good sign of maturity is being able to handle your emotions in a way that doesn't intimidate others. So when someone gets angry and resorts to yelling and scare tactics it pisses me off.
I hate people who try to guilt trip me. It's not gonna work, if I have sympathy for you than so be it, but trying to get my pity is just shameful.
I hate people who always make excuses and blame their fuck ups on other people/things. I hate people who take their self hatred out on others.
I hate parents who cannot for the life of them care for and nurture their children. People who are distant/emotionally constipated and unable to show affection towards their own god damn children shouldn't have kids. Kids need to know they are loved and cared for, craving social connections and a sense of belonging is apart of human nature.
People who act like emotions are stupid/invalid. It's so middle school edgy phase to me to think that showing your emotions is weak. It's like people think it's cool to be some emotionally constipated hard ass. I think if you spend your life running from your feelings or pretending they aren't there to make you sound cool, you've really got to reprioritize. people feel what they feel and there's no way to control that.
I hate people who pretend they don't gossip or judge others. Being concerned with other people is apart of life. I love gossiping, I love people, I love learning about them and trying to understand them.
I hate people who think being nice to people you hate is ""fake"". It's called being professional, not everything needs to end in personal conflict. Sometimes people just don't like each other, that doesn't mean they need to make it obvious.
Lastly I hate people who try to pity me and coddle me. It makes me feel unclean and pathetic. I can't stand it

This is way longer than I intended whoops... Sorry for any typos! I'm on mobile and also im kind of a dumbass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Story of my life :( I had been doing so good, and then I broke. I've been stuck in a b/p cycle for so long. I can even make myself vomit either, I just use a shit ton of laxatives (hah). It doesn't do me any good ether, I just hate the feeling of food in my stomach. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you were really that confident in your looks, I doubt you'd post about it on this circlejerk sub. It sounds more like you're looking for people to validate you. I'm going to assume something one of these guys said really hurt you, and you want to believe that they're the insecure one. Really, the best way to judge your attractiveness is through other peoples' reactions, they're far more likely to be objective about your appearance than you. </TEXT>
