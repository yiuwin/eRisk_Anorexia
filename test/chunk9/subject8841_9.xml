	<TITLE> What defines the American "North and South" </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Non-american here and whenever reading about history or listening to the Hamilton mixtape (classic btw) I hear the terms North and South a lot, I'm not to great on american geography but in Hamilton Virginians were referring to themselves as Southerners whilst New York was North but they don't see that far apart on the map, so is there a definitive border between North and South? Where there different borders back in the 1700 and 1800's? </TEXT>
