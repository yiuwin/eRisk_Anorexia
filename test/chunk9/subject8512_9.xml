	<TEXT> It mostly depends on how you would notate it and where the beat lies. The beaming would be different and the strong sense of an 1 would of course be placed different (sorry I'm looking for a word I can't remember right now)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try with another monitor just to be sure that it isn't the tv that is the problem (with my lg smart tv, even with game mode on I get noticeable but manageable lag) (Be sure to check what input delay the monitor you are using have at it's current setting. Anything more than 40 ms is not most often not preferable)

If it really is your system, try with different games and emulators to be sure it isn't a problem with any of those. (If it is a game problem, find another rom or  just deal with it , if it is an emulator problem, try another emulator if possible.)  

Lastly, if possible try with another controller, this is probably the least probable reason, but it could be a hardware problem, if that's the case your beat bet is probably to get a new controller. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends. 
Your five-beat (5/4) measure is divided in 1, 4+1, 3+2 or 5 or the reverses. Depending on this you can notate with five fourth-notes, a while note bound to one fourth note, and so on. 

However, you can always, no matter what time signature, fill out a bar with a whole note or a while pause if no other notes or pauses are present in the measure.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, as others already answered, most modern televisions has lot's of post processing to make tv look great, but all those bells and whistles adds some quite noticeable delay that generally only is noticeable when controlling something directly that needs timing, such as a game. Most of these televisions have something called "game-mode" though, that removes lot's of the post processing and reduces the delay significantly. Not all tv's have this option though and depending on the model it's more or less effective. Good luck though!

Edit: reading this again I'm noticing that I really like the word "though" during the evening lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is indeed possible, but without a commercial license and copyright to all the games, it's illegal (to make others pay to use it anyway).

Edit:
You would need a coin-acceptor that would work as a controller input and configure it in retroarch to be the coin button. </TEXT>

Those panels are just there to make sure the screen doesn't fall out. You can push the screen so it rotates so you can get in and do maintenance if needed.

It's not very visible in the picture but there are some holes for a pair of speakers on the front bottom panel. It's two quite old computer speakers with two elements each. Two not very big woofers, and two tweeters.

Edit: some punctuation </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope, I did the shadow temple without even knowing that it existed. Then I couldn't get in to the spirit temple (because you need the eye if truth to find it) so I had to look up a guide online and wtf, that would have made the shadow temple SO much easier! I used the laser sight on the hookshot to find all invisible walls, and the rest was trial and error, but it worked!

	<TEXT> I don't think math and piano is comparable in that way. In math you use logic to resolve and rewrite something to something easier to understand or something more useful. The piano is meant to be a took for you to extend yourself and relise your musical ideas. The biggest problem with this is that you have limited dynamics, you only have half-steps, you only have a particular timbre and you need to press down keys (presumably with your fingers) to make the mostly intended sound. So I would say, the fundamentals of the piano is what is in the way of perfectly recreating your musical ideas, and that would be:

It's physical and not a part of your mind (limited by what you are physically able to recreate). Limited dynamics. Limited timbre. Limited pitch.  </TEXT>
