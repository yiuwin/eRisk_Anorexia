	<TEXT> Maybe a dumb question, but the card says "enchant creature you control". Since it doesn't say target, can you put this on one of your creatures with shroud? Is it somewhere in the rules that Aura's always target? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a sloppy example but, here goes - put this into Jeskai Saheeli, you are on the draw:


T1 - Play a land, you have no 1 drops - 7 cards in hand


T2 - Play a land, opponent casts a creature, you either counter it or kill it - 6 cards in hand


T3 - Play a land and cast Kefnet, opponent casts a creature on their turn - 5 cards in hand


T4 - Play a land, pass. If opponent attacks you can use Kefnet's ability to draw a card and return a land - at which point you will have 7 cards in hand, and Kefnet can block. If opponent doesn't attack, draw a card on EOT.

	<TEXT>  Is the sacrifice of readability worth the effect? 


To me, yes. For Invocations, masterpieces, whatever, it is a chance to do something really creative, which they did and it really wowed me in a good way - an effect that would have been diluted if they held back. It's *because* they look so different that it had such an effect. For me the effect was positive, for others, not so.

	<TEXT> Somebody wrote this on the blog and it sums up my thoughts pretty well:


"People fear what is new and different. In my humble opinion I am happy you all pushed the boundary on them and I think they look incredible. I wouldnt want normal cards to ever look like that, but for this is the exact type of thing Masterpieces should be." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like that they took chances for the sake of pushed flavor/style. Masterpieces, Invocations, whatever are the opportunities to go all out and try crazy things. I can see the legibility factor being a thing for newer players, but I guess I just don't care.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I seriously think they did a great job. The art, borders, font choices, and layout all go awesomely with the theme of the set and they weren't afraid to think way outside the box to get there.
I'm genuinely surprised by people's negative reactions, but art is subjective - this is ignoring bandwagon folks and people having a momentary overreaction to change. </TEXT>
