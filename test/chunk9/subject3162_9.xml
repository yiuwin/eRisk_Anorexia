	<TITLE> Question about depo and pregnancy </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-27 05:18:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *Edit: I just looked at my calendar and my last injection was August 7th, which is only 82 days ago. I forgot my OBGYN started giving it to me up to two weeks early to combat the endometriosis issues. So, I'm not even past the 3 month marker yet. Should I still worry?*
I hope this okay to post here, I'm not sure where else to ask...
I'm 23 years old and have been on the depo-provera shot for 8 years now. I have endometriosis and ovarian cysts. I also haven't had a period in over 7 years now. 
As with the depo, you have the two week window of when you can get your shot and I my two week window started on the 23rd, but I can't get my shot until tomorrow. 
My fianc (of 8 years) and I had unprotected sex tonight, then it hit me, I'm due for my shot :( 
This has happened before in the past and I've never gotten pregnant, as I've never gone beyond a week of waiting to get it.
I've been in a lot of pain and having period like symptoms over the past few weeks (pregnancy tests have all come back negative) but we figured its due to the Endo. 
What are my chances of getting pregnant if I've been on it this long and it hasn't even been 13 weeks since my last injection? 
Sorry for the wall of text and rambling, I'm just a little worried now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there, it sounds like you're on the right track with getting into therapy and trying medication again. Also, the breathing techniques help me quite a bit too :) 
First off, I'm not sure how much you've read on this sub, but its preached and reiterated again and again that the only way to catch noro is by ingesting vomit or feces particles, disgusting, right? Haha. But us emets need to hear that, read it, and constantly be reminded of it during stressful situations. Just because you're around someone who is or has been ill, doesn't guarantee anything at all. Proper hand washing is a must. As long as you wash your hands before eating, touching, or putting anything in your mouth, you're good to go :) 
I always carry peppermint candies or gum to help my tummy, sipping on water also helps me. 
Have you ever heard of seabands? They hit a certain pressure point in your wrist that helps with nausea and it has actually helped me quite a few times. You can google "nausea pressure point" and it'll show you where it is :)
I worry constantly about food poisoning and in one of my recent posts here, someone told me the actual chance of getting food poisoning (they broke it all down themselves) and its 0.0008% That's an incredibly small chance to waste our time worrying about it, and once I realized that, my fear eased up quite a bit. Please don't start depriving yourself of food, as so many of us on here have and/or still do. It makes you feel worse in the long run and makes everything so much harder, it's not worth it. 
I know that when I used to smoke, without fail, I'd get nauseous, and I've been told I'm not the only one. So, its a pretty common occurrence, but maybe it was the lack of sleep, being in a car, then that overwhelming panic out of nowhere that did it. Try not to let it keep bothering you, it happened, you ended up being fine, it's over with :) Dwelling on it isn't going to help. 
I'm glad you found this sub and I hope we can all help you out! Everyone here is great and they all have some awesome advice and are incredibly supportive :) 
Edit: words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm gonna be honest with you - avoid the depo-provera shot unless you plan on being on it for quite a while. 
I had no side effects besides some weight gain (less than 10lbs. in the 8 years I've been on it) and some acne, but coming off of it? Oh boy, it's hell. I'm still on it but my OBGYN's office f*cked up on scheduling, so now I'm overdue for it and experiencing some withdrawal side effects - hot flashes, night sweats, pain so bad I'm on percocet and Norco, bleeding, diarrhea, nausea, can't eat, headache :( So much suck. 
I have endometriosis so it's great for me and other women who suffer from issues like that, but if it's just for regular contraception, I'd shy away from it and use it as a last resort.
I've never used any other type of BC but I just wanted to throw all of this out there, cause I'm in hell right now and don't see myself getting off of it anytime soon if this is what's going to happen :( 
I hope you find something that works for you! Best of luck! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am so glad you are happy I shared this! Not only was it therapeutic in a way, I really hoped it might reach even just a few people who suffer from emetophobia and let them know they're truly not alone. 
This phobia is debilitating a lot of the time and I have literally almost died from it. If my story and my courage to put it all out there helps even just one person, that makes me feel more incredible than you'll ever know.
I'm so tired of hearing all of us suffer because we're so misunderstood and even some therapists look at us like we're crazy, it needs more attention. I don't want to see anyone go through what I or 90% of the people who come to this subreddit have. 
Thank you for the kind words xo :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had mine out in 2012 and at first I thought it was my IBS, trapped gas, then a stomach bug. It hurt all the way up into my shoulder and I couldn't move cause the attacks hurt so bad. I'm not trying to frighten you at all, as you said that every case is indeed different, but I had one nasty attack that made me v* three times :( I ended up in the hospital for IV fluids and anti-nausea meds, but I also didn't have any anti-nausea meds at home during this time otherwise it probably wouldn't have been as bad. 
I had a HIDA-scan which shows the function of your gallbladder and whatnot, they run a simple saline solution (if I remember correctly, I know it's not a medicine) through an IV for the first hour , while you lay under this machine that takes pictures of it going through. For the second hour, they inject something that mimics the digestion process, as if you've just eaten. My gallbladder was dead and not functioning so I did get n* and started to get upset, but it passed very quickly. 
The surgery itself was a breeze and I was back to myself in about a week, actually. A lot of my stomach issues subsided and I felt SO much better after having it out. 
I have other health issues which cause me to get n* quite a bit, so that's the only reason I have stomach issues again. I don't regret having it removed one bit :)    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Possible trigger warning in actual article*
A few months ago a woman posted on this subreddit looking for people to interview about their emetophobia. So, I contacted her as it sounded like a chance to get the word out there about this (a lot of times debilitating) phobia. It has literally almost killed me and has ruined my life. 
I spoke with her on the phone a couple times and we corresponded a lot through e-mail, and she was so incredibly kind and actually had dealt with emetophobia herself. It felt so good to finally talk about it all, and the prospect of it maybe reaching others whom have suffered in silence for god knows how long, made me want to do it even more.
We really aren't alone and I hope this article helps someone, anyone, in any way possible. 
I just wanted to share it with everyone, cause out of all people, you guys truly understand. Don't be ashamed! We did NOT ask for this, it is very real, and most times crippling. There's no reason we should suffer in silence just because it is so misunderstood.
Much love to everyone, keep your heads held high.

	<TEXT> I guess the stigma of using pain killers has stuck with me cause I felt dirty filling my prescription for them :( My town is overrun with drug users and people whom take advantage of doctors for pain killers, so I teared up asking the doctor for something. I don't want to get the label of a drug abuser, especially from my doctors office, and be treated differently every time I go in there. 
Pain killers knock me out usually, so the pro to that is sweet, sweet sleep, but the cons being I'm too out of it to do anything productive, hahaha. My friend was actually the pharmacist who filled it and even pulled me aside to ask if I was okay cause she knows something must be going on for me to actually fill it. 
I still haven't taken one, but today has been pretty decent pain wise. It's just kinda relieving to know I have them for when it becomes unbearable again. You actually made me feel a lot better about all of it, and its nice to know I'm not crazy and this pain is totally real. 
I'm still debating on treatment options, but Lupron just absolutely terrifies me. I have such bad luck with medications and it'd be my luck that I'd get every side effect and hate myself for even trying it. Hopefully after my surgery I'll have some solid answers and be able to make a final decision. 
My gyno said he'd biopsy whatever looked abnormal and that they weren't incredibly concerned about the stripe thickness, as everything else has come back clear. So I'm trying to not drive myself crazy over it cause it's just gonna stress me out more :/ 
Thank you again for your reply, I appreciate it so much! :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for all of that! :) 
I finally fell asleep (before I could even take a pain pill actually) and got some decent rest and was feeling a bit better today. You are so right, rest and sleep are more crucial than I realized. Am I the only one that feels like absolute death if I don't get at least 6-7 hours a night? I feel like I've been hit by a truck when I don't get enough sleep. 
I'm just overwhelmed with everything right now and I'm such a hypochondriac at times (everyone in my family is as well) so surgery is freaking me out. I've had laparoscopic surgery twice, once being my gallbladder, but I'm feeling like this is my first time or something. 
My doctor is trying to convince me to go the Lupron route and I'm really trying to educate myself on what my best options are and lupron is something I'm just not comfortable trying. I've been on the depo shot for 8 years now but its obviously not doing a very good job for me anymore, so I'm at a loss right now. Plus, I'm worried about the withdraw from depo. 
I'm just hoping this surgery goes smoothly, gives me some answers, and maybe some relief. 
Thank you so much for your words and support, you guys are all so awesome :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And to be honest - I'm terrified.
I'm scared of what they may find when they go in and that I'm going to get awful news once I come to. My first lap went swimmingly, which I have a gut feeling won't happen this time. I was 18 then and I'm 23 now. 
I've been in an incredible amount of pain these past several months and between CT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, blood work, nothing can be found except for a few small cysts, a small kidney stone in each kidney, and one thing that bothers me - my endometrial stripe is 10mm thick. I've been on depo for 8 years and haven't had a real period in 7 years, so I'm not sure if that could be part of it? All I know is I'm scared of cancer. My paps have all been normal and nothing else is showing up on imaging, but that'd be my luck at this point.
I'm trying so hard to stay positive, but this pain is ruining my life right now and as much as I'm against using pain killers, I finally broke down and asked my gyno if he could give me something, and he gave me Percocet. I just got them yesterday afternoon and still haven't taken one cause I promised myself it'd never come to using narcotics, but it's looking like I'll be taking one soon, since the pain woke me up from a dead sleep and is still not easing up. 
I'm not sure why I'm posting this or what I'm asking for...advice, guidance maybe? How do all of you incredible ladies deal with this on a daily basis and still manage to even get out of bed? Even showering has been a task for me, let alone keeping up housework and taking care of my disabled mother, and I'm starting to slip into a dark place. 
Thank you so much for reading this if you did, it feels good to get it all out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No shame in that! I'm 23 and have my fathers teddy bear that I cuddle and hug when I'm panicking or in pain. There's nothing wrong with something that comforts you :) 
Maybe put on some TV or Netflix to distract you, if that ever helps you. For some reason it does for me. I also get up and walk around a little. 
Have you ever tried the pressure point in your wrist for nausea? I swear it helps for some reason. You can google "pressure point for nausea" and it'll show you where it is. Its the same thing sea bands do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, it's awesome you're reassuring yourself and staying calm :) Anxiety is such a bitch. I've been getting ridiculous waves of nausea from ovarian cysts I just found out about, but I'm trying to just breath through them and do something to take my mind off of it. I even took up knitting! Geez, I'm getting old. 
Nonetheless, I'm super proud of you and you're gonna be fine :) Thyroid meds can do all sorts of wacky stuff and I'm sure you know that if your thyroid is the least bit off, you feel awful all over. Gastro and cardiac symptoms are my first sign that I'm hyperactive again.

	<TEXT> I have IBS and endometriosis so I get legit nausea and my doctors understand that, but they do warn me of complications from overuse of them. 
I take Phenergan and prolonged use can lead to paralysis of the stomach, known as gastroparesis. Zofran can cause constipation and headaches, as well. They can also make you INCREDIBLY tired and groggy, as anti-emetics such as Phenergan are antihistamines and have sedative properties. 
I agree with everyone here though, I am incredibly attached to them and if I didn't have them, I'd have constant anxiety over it, only complicating things. 
I have taken them for years and also abused them, so I'm trying to wean myself down to only using them only if I absolutely need to. 
I chew gum constantly, which has helped. I drink a ton of water, I keep ginger ale, Pepto, emetrol, peppermint teas, and antacid tablets in my house at all times. I also use the acupuncture pressure point in my wrist a lot, it does help. 
If you get actual nausea quite a bit, you may want to go ahead and talk with your doctor about it. It could be IBS or a stomach issue that can be resolved so you're not getting nauseous as much :) But if it's bothering you that bad, just be honest and tell them nothing is helping your nausea and ask about an anti-emetic. Just PLEASE beware that it is not a fix all and that it's incredibly easy to become dependent on them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow thank you so much for your reply :) 
I actually keep telling myself the same exact thing about everyone else eating and very rarely getting sick, but you putting it into percentages, that actually kind of eased my mind even more. I never bothered to try and figure that out but that makes me feel better. 
I'm eating, but it's hard because my body isn't used to it so I do get gastrointestinal distress quite a bit, but I've got teas and probiotics that I'm going to start and try to help my digestive system get back on track.
With noro going around it's been even tougher cause it's fucking everywhere right now and my immune system sucks so bad, so I'm driving myself nuts with hand washing and sanitizing literally everything that gets touched in my house up to 10 times a day. It's probably not healthy but it makes me feel better, haha. 
I'm just tired at this point in time but I'm willing to fight for my life. It all just builds up and everyone is so frustrated with me and it hurts, I feel so alone. The only one who listens and loves me unconditionally no matter what is my big ol' Saint Bernard, who is the best cuddler, so at least I've got that :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the past couple of months my emetophobia has been unbearable. 
I'm in therapy, I see a psychiatrist, but I feel like I'm not making any progress in that aspect. I have been threatened that if I do not improve by the beginning of next year, I will be sent to an inpatient eating disorder clinic two hours away from home, possibly with a feeding tube down my nose until I reach a healthy weight. 
I forced myself to the grocery store the other night, I turned a corner to go down another aisle, and end up face to face with a woman who had an NG tube. She was blonde, frail, her eyes sunken in, and she just looked...sad. I wasn't grossed out, but I quickly turned around and tried to make it to my car before I burst out into tears - I didn't make it. I started bawling in the store, looking like an idiot, alone, scared, cause what I saw was me. I will fight tooth and nail not to be involuntarily put into a hospital and fight even harder to not have a feeding tube. 
Do I have an eating disorder? Yes. Is it textbook anorexia? NO. It is not. That is what these therapists and doctors are not understanding, I DO NOT WANT TO WEIGH 105lbs. I never thought I was fat, it's not about control, it's not my best friend, nor do I get any kind of high from it. I am just fucking scared of food. I am so alone in this battle, I'm beginning to wonder if it's even worth fighting anymore. My body is fucked, even when I do eat, it makes me sick cause my eating patterns are so screwed that my body is confused and I've damaged it. My heart is incredibly weak and doesn't work right anymore either.
I'm 23, this wasn't what I had planned for my life. This isn't what I wanted. This is never going to end and I'm going to be alone in this until the day it kills me. 
I'm not sure why I'm even writing this. I guess this is the only place that I'm ever understood and never feel alone. You guys are all awesome individuals, thank you for reminding me that maybe I'm not alone and this is real. I'm starting to truly feel crazy.

I really hope you get it figured out soon, I've been in kind of the same boat and it's so discouraging and depressing, but like someone here said, it WILL come to an end. Stay strong! :)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Endocrinologists can be a nightmare for some reason. I had hyperthyroidism and still have nodules on my thyroid and all I've gotten is the run around. 
I wish you guys the best of luck!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there any way you could be having some sort of allergic reaction? I get hot flashes and weird chills/shivers when I'm about to have diarrhea, it's kind of my warning sign before the shitstorm hits, ahaha. Pun intended. 
But for real, this stuff sucks and I'm sorry you have to deal with it but I hope you find something that helps you. Everyone here has awesome advice, anything's worth a shot when you're at the end of your rope.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has taken me a long time to try and start watching it again after starting season one, but I totally agree that it gets SOOO much better. It's so great! Why did I wait so long?!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd honestly be searching for new doctors. I have honestly been in your shoes with my concerns being pushed aside, and it's definitely frustrating, but don't give up. 
An endocrinologist would test for things like Hashimoto's thyroiditis and graves disease, a rheumatologist could check for autoimmune diseases like lupus, and like I said earlier, a gastroenterologist may be helpful in figuring out those attacks she has.

	<TEXT> I'm lactose intolerant, that much I know so I avoid dairy like the plague. I'll be having tests done soon to check for celiacs but other than that, my diet is pretty much consistent and I can't pinpoint anything directly right now. 
I'm my moms caretaker (she has sarcoidosis and is on oxygen 24/7) as we have absolutely no family and my dad passed when I was younger, so my main focus right now has been taking care of her cause we just found out she may be in congestive heart failure. I've been pushing my appointments around to make sure she comes first, but I know I need to take care of myself too, so I have everything scheduled for myself in the coming months. This isn't something I'm ignoring by any means, life has just been hectic and kinda rough.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! I was thinking the same thing about having diarrhea but then that little voice in my head was like "But wait! What if..." Haha. I'm actually feeling quite a bit better tonight and I was able to eat some ramen and crackers, plus a piece of toast.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've only read and heard about cases of it so I'm not completely sure, but if they did an MRI/CT of your brain and spinal column, I'm guessing something should have shown up. Unless you need to have an MRI with contrast to determine, I do know it's an issue with the cerebellum and there are different types of chiari. 
Like I said, I'm not a doctor but anything is worth looking into :) I really hope you figure it out soon and get to feeling better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, if her throat was bothering her it *could* be strep, sometimes it's hard to differentiate in adults whether or not it's strep. But the reason I mention it is because every time I would get strep, I would v* :( I have no idea why, but it always happened. Maybe her body reacts to stuff the same way.
Try to keep your mind occupied and as someone already said, remember how you catch stomach bugs :) Just be diligent in washing your hands.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your reply :) I really hope that's the case with me if that's what it is. I've been really good in dealing with this phobia for quite a while now but I knew this time of year was going to be hard :/  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IANAD but it's definitely within reason to have your thyroid tested, your symptoms seem to correlate with a thyroid issue. But thyroid issues are incredibly common and easy to treat nowadays so try not to worry if that happens to be your issue :)  </TEXT>
