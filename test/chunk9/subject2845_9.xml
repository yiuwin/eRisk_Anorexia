	<TITLE> American Debit card situation(s) in Europe?? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-05-30 20:48:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey travelers :) On Monday I will be going to Europe for a month to visit my boyfriend who lives in Germany. We will be travelling to at least four different countries, and I guess I was wondering what you guys thought the best way was for me to bring my money? My boyfriend keeps telling me to bring cash and he can just exchange it there, but I'm not very comfortable flying by myself with thousands of dollars on my person. He has told me that the atms over there have a large % (he says up to 30) charge for American cards. When I called my bank, on the other hand, they told me there should only be a 1% charge for the conversion. I know travelers checks are also an option but he said he didn't know where we could take them. Long story short, my cash happy boyfriend is no help! And obviously I want to lose the least amount of money as I can, seeing as with the conversion to Euro I'm already losing about .25/$1 and in the UK I'll be losing more like .5-.7 
Thank you so much in advance for the help, reddit always has the answers! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> One month in Germany and so much to do!! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend is from Freiburg, Germany. We currently live in Milwaukee Wisconsin, but now that he is finished with college he will be moving back home on May 24th. On June 3rd, I will be flying as well to visit him for a month. I am beyond excited for this experience. I am a huge history buff and have always wanted to go to Europe (literally one of the only things I've always wanted to do actually) My boyfriend is a travel expert, and has been all over the world with his family multiple times (think climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro and things of the like) so he has told me that (besides Germany) he wants me to figure out what I want to do. We already have tickets booked to London from June 10th-15th, and the following week we will be visiting his Grandparents in Munich. I guess I just wanted some advice on what we should do in these cities, or anywhere else we should go? He isn't really as historically-minded as I am, but I know that he has readied himself for some learning to happen (though he's been pushing for things like the coffee shops in Amsterdam.) I know that I want to go to Paris as well, and Freiburg isn't too far so I know that won't be much of a problem. We decided to save Italy for another trip, so I would appreciate not being reminded of what I'm missing - haha. I really just want to have an awesome time and go to places that are a little off the beaten path. This shouldn't be too hard seeing as my boyfriend knows the area well, but I thought any extra tips on reddit would be great!
Thanks! </TEXT>
