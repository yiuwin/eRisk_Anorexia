	<TEXT> found a relevant bullet point in one of the word documents: 

*6. You're sad because these should be happy times .. but you knew, long ago, when you visited his family that this young man brought along a lot of trouble ...
You had more than a glimpse of it! 
If that's who you want, that's what's in the "package" !!* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just posted for the first time the other day and it was so therapeutic that I can't wait to share more. So as I said, my fiance has a god-awful family. Even from overseas in Portugal, they have managed to make life hellish for the two of us. Ultimatums, threats, trashtalk. They have been opposed to our relationship since it began over 2.5 years ago and when we got engaged this winter, it was like a bomb of crazy dropping. 

The night we got engaged, I FaceTimed my family and best friends and shared the happy news. I was excited to share it on FB too, of course, and asked FH if there was anyone he would like to call before so they don't find out through FB. He said no because "it is a happy day and I don't want to invite any negativity in". Understanding and sharing my excitement to share the happy news with the world, he just asked me to wait until it was like 3 a.m. in Portugal so he wouldn't have to deal with it until tomorrow. 

You know where this is going.

3 a.m. Portugal time rolls around and I make the post. Likes and congratulations start rolling in! It felt amazing to be able to tell people (engagement was planned). 

FFIL calls. He is a scary man. Narcissistic Personality Disorder, textbook case. He is extremely (google-able net worth) wealthy and has a network comprised of people who enable and encourage his antics in fear of being shunned from all the perks that come along with being associated with him. The perks are plentiful and incredible, I admit. He calls, no "hello", no "how are you". 

"Is this a joke? This is not something that should be joked about."

FH's step-sister was still awake and on FB and woke up his dad. FH told him of course it's not a joke, what a stupid thing to ask. He yelled at FH about me, I am a gold digger, my family are also golddiggers somehow, he is cut off, he is "set free to the jungle" yada yada. (FH felt that this phone call needed to happen to answer the why he picked up/ didn't hang up question. I have to respect that.) 1 minute later follow up phone call: "Is she pregnant?"

The next day, my FGMIL calls him just sobbing and occasionally shrieking. Upon his translation, she just told him it was the most betrayed she's ever felt and she's never felt heartbreak so strongly. No, the phone was not on speaker, but I could still hear from the next room. My sweet FH was devastated by this, even though he knew what to expect, and when the phone call ended he was sitting, leaning against the kitchen cabinets crying. It was just heartbreaking to see. I just can't imagine my sweet grandmothers saying something so awful about the happiest part of my life. 

This sort of thing went on for a long time. FH's mom, Miserable Monica, flew over (unannounced, of course) a couple weeks later because FH went VLC with everyone. He was a shell of himself truly. 

We met with her and my parents came to try to be a buffer/mediate. My parents are like the gold-standard for parents. Incredibly supportive, loving, caring people and have treated FH like a son since the beginning. MM was so confused why we couldn't wait just one more year! FH's dad made us an irresistible offer! He would create a fake job title to give FH a work visa in the USA so he wouldn't need this green card marriage. /s

I said a lot of things about his family in anger. I called his father a vile man and I said that I am not going to support or enable toxic relationships with uncaring people. I stand behind all of this btw, but I may have had a little more venom in my tone than technically appropriate. 

Miserable Monica began sobbing and asked how I could break up a family. Good question. Clearly *I* am the one breaking up this family!

I told her I have been having a very hard time with all of this and she responded genuinely dumbfounded "What? You? How does this affect you????" and since she asked so genuinely I explained: getting engaged is supposed to be a joyous time and it is difficult to be met with such negativity from people who are meant to be congratulatory. 

She looked back at me with the most twisted face and said "you met his family before you said yes, didn't you?"

	<TEXT> he will in time. NC, I mean. I have made it abundantly clear that no child of mine will know these people and potentially experience any sort of abuse, so he knows that it is inevitable. it's going to take time is all. what i mean by he wouldn't be the man that I love is that he is not spiteful and so full of love that breaking relationships is extremely challenging for him. he is very loving and committed which is important to me as I intend to spend a lifetime with him </TEXT>

	<TEXT> oh jeez that sounds horrible! I had to get an x-ray and tests for both of those and they came back clear. If I feel this bad with just a run-of-the-mill bug, I can't imagine how those two must have felt... 

We invited everyone to the wedding hahaha even the ultimatum givers. We are kind-of just ignoring it/treating it like a big tantrum. My parents advise to just be the bigger people and I am inclined to follow their advice. Grandparents (the ones who nearly *died* at the news of the engagement) replied to the e-save the date (for all international attendees we used those) with their mailing address hahaha. 

As much as she might deserve this sickness, the next person she sees doesn't! This is a really bad one, almost feel like I should quarantine myself! Haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's very complicated. he knows objectively how bad all of this is and he is very protective when anything effects me, but he is not ready to lose all communication yet. they are his family (I know this sub has a whole faaaaamily-thing, but it'd be the same for me). his whole childhood was spent with them -- some of it good times -- and as much as I wish they could disappear *poof* he wouldn't be the man i love if he were just cool with that. he certainly has a very strained relationship with his mom at this point, but he does see her.
