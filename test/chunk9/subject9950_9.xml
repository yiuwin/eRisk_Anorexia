	<TEXT> Presumably it was emo Barry that became Savitar and Savitar is already a time remnant because Barry changed things so emo Barry wouldn't become Savitar. We still don't know what the "crisis" was that caused the red skies and Barry to disappear but presumably that will be revealed and have something to do with why and how emo Barry became Savitar.

As for why Savitar would want to kill Iris, well, isn't it obvious? Savitar considers himself a god and he became a god because Iris died. He kills Iris because killing Iris causes him to become Savitar. It's an infinite loop. </TEXT>

So, there you have it, Gunn confirms that he is going to make Solo movies for the Guardian characters after Guardians 3. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One theory that is floating around is that James Gunn wanted characters that were owned by Fox and that he only announced that he was writing Guardians of the Galaxy 3 when he knew he could write the story he wanted to write.  For instance, when Fox was at risk of losing the rights to Daredevil, Marvel let it be known that they would rather Fox gave them the rights to the Silver Surfer instead.  Shareholders at Constantin have voted NOT to go ahead with another Fantastic Four movie which begs the question as to what happens to the rights.  Guardians 3 might introduce Warlock, Galactus and the Silver Surfer.  Gunn's idea for a Groot and Rocket movie would have to wait. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> James Gunn has said that the characters introduced at the end of GotGV2 would show up in "future movies" but not necessarily GotG3.  He said he had movies mapped out "for the next decade".  He also said that GotG3 would be "the end of the story" for "this team" which implies that GotG4 would pick up with new characters.  This is probably because the Guardians characters signed a six picture deal and that includes the Avengers movies so there would be a passing of the torch so to speak.  There might even be solo movies involving the current characters.  We'll see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, they probably couldn't, for the same reason that Marvel couldn't do an X-Men TV show and they ended up making that terrible Mutant X garbage. Now they are making a TV show with Polaris, Blink and Thunderbird for Fox. If Marvel had the TV rights to the X-Men and Spider-Man then why don't we see X-Men or Spider-Man on Agents of SHIELD? If Marvel had TV rights to Daredevil, Luke Cage and Iron Fist then why didn't they do Defenders ten years ago?

The problem is that it isn't just TV and movie rights but live action and animated rights.

	<TEXT> Marvel wanted Hugh Jackman to appear in a Spider-Man movie.  Fox stepped in.  They told Hugh Jackman "Oh, sure, but you'll need a costume and we'll go find one for you to wear" and then Hugh Jackman called them up at Fox and they said "Sorry, we don't seem to be able to find the costume we were going to let you use" and Hugh Jackman missed the window for filming his cameo.  Hugh said in an interview that Fox probably were just messing with him because they didn't want Wolverine in a Spider-Man movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We know for certain that Avengers 4 is called "Gauntlet"... by Zoe Saldana.  There's also zero chance that she came up with that name by herself.  It may say on the script "Avengers 4: Based on the comic Infinity Gauntlet by Jim Starlin".  It's actually no secret that Avengers 4 will be based on Infinity Gauntlet so the title "Avengers: Infinity Gauntlet" won't be much of a spoiler.  

Oh and there's no way it is "New Avengers" because it is too soon for them to kill off all the OG Avengers.  They even promised Scarlett Johansson her own movie so, wow, she would be so pissed when she reads the script.  Chris Evans says he will be Captain America "for as long as they will have me" so it would be ironic if he checks out in Infinity War.

Besides, it doesn't make a lot of sense.  "Oh my God!" Spider-Man says.  "Thanos just killed Doctor Strange, the Vision, Scarlet Witch, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man and Captain America!  I'm going to have to assemble a stronger team!  I'm going to have to find Ant Man, the Wasp, Black Panther and the Winter Soldier!  They are our only hope of defeating Thanos!"  

Because that's how they defeat Thanos.  They shrink him down and step on him.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My guess is that Feige has made a deal with Sony to have the non-Spider-Man Spider-Man movies be in the MCU.

[1] MAY 2020

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. Yes, the actors are busy filming Infinity War but 2020 is still three years away and they are already talking about bringing back the current cast plus Adam Warlock.

[2] AUG 2020

Venom. This movie is happening whether we want it or not.

[3] NOV 2020

Doctor Strange 2. Scott Derrickson returns and introduces Nightmare and Clea. Wong has a bigger role.

[4] MAY 2021

Nova Corps. Feige said that the titles to the Phase 4 movies would be "spoilers" so presumably the Nova Corps have a big role in Avengers: Infinity War. Glenn Close returns as Irani Rael / Nova Prime. John C. Reilly returns as Rhomann Dey. Peter Serafinowicz returns as Denarian Saal. New characters include Major Victory / Vance Astro, Quasar / Wendell Vaughn, Moondragon / Heather Douglas, Martyr / Phylla-Vell and Richard Ryder. Obviously Phylla-Vell is going to be a Kree so the how and why she is working with the Nova Corp has to be explained. I would tentatively have the Russo Bros direct depending on their schedule.

[5] JULY 2021

Spider-Man Homecoming 3. Jon Watts returns for a second sequel. If Kraven the Hunter and / or Mysterio appear in Homecoming 2 then this could be a Sinister Six movie.

[6] NOVEMBER 2021

Black Panther 2. Ryan Coogler returns to direct the sequel. It will probably end up being a trilogy.

[7] MAY 2022

Black Widow. Peyton Reed is tapped to direct Black Widow. It will be a heist movie involving Roxxon. Natasha assembles a team consisting of herself, Ant Man, Wasp, Falcon, Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye. Chris Evans cameos as Steve Rogers.

[8] JULY 2022

Black Cat and Silver Sable. Presumably this is Sony's answer to the Catwoman / Harley Quinn movie.

[9] NOVEMBER 2022

Captain Marvel 2. Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck return for another movie. This assumes the first movie is a hit.

	<TEXT> I mean, it's not like he had a choice.  When Age of Ultron was announced people were confused because they were expecting Thanos in Avengers 2.  So Feige went ahead and announced nine films (including Inhumans) at one event.  He doesn't have to do that again but, for God's sake, people have already figured out that Guardians 3 is coming out in May, 2020, so announcing it officially at Comicon is the least he can do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I have noticed is that the movies and TV shows tend to have a lot of black men and Asian women but few black women or Asian men.

Black men?  Obviously Nick Fury, Black Panther, Luke Cage, Falcon, War Machine, Ben Urich, Oscar Clemons, Pop Hunter, Lawrence Wilkins, Cottonmouth, Diamondback.

Black women?  The police captain, Misty Knight, Mariah, Black Panther's bodyguards.

Asian women?  Madame Gao, Dr. Cho, Agent May, Daisy Johnson, Elektra, Colleen Wing, Jiaying.

Asian men?  Davos, Nobu, Lei Kung, Wong, discount Magneto on Agents of SHIELD.

Black women and Asian men have this problem in Hollywood where they are not considered as physically attractive as white men and women whereas black men and Asian women don't have this problem.  As a result, "diversity" favors black men and Asian women more than black women or Asian men. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, it may be that there are a lot of cable providers that don't offer Freeform so this gives people time to either change providers or request Freeform as part of their cable subscription.  I think the big question is whether or not people will go to this amount of trouble for one show.  One thing is clear: if you aren't subscribed to Freeform and the show comes out then you will either miss it or download it online and the people at ABC would rather you didn't download it online. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pitch Spider-Man Homecoming 2-4 plus Venom and Avengers 5 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-23 06:55:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The deal with Sony must be a constant headache for Feige.  He clearly has creative control over the Spider-Man Homecoming movies but now Sony has announced that they want to go ahead with Venom and Black Cat movies and that they'll do them even without Marvel's participation.  

Obviously, October, 2018 is too soon for a Venom movie.  They don't have a script or an actor or even a director attached.  The movie should be delayed to July, 2020 and Venom needs to be set up in Spider-Man Homecoming 2.

First of all, Spider-Man is going into space, presumably, in Avengers: Infinity War.  At the very least we will have aliens coming to Earth.  So Spider-Man gets exposed to the symbiote in Avengers: Infinity War.  Spider-Man is then wearing the black costume in Avengers 4.  The other Avengers convince Spider-Man that having an alien living on his body is a bad idea so they get it off of him.  

The symbiote then doesn't have a big role in Spider-Man Homecoming which is a smaller story about Spider-Man being hounded by the press and Kraven the Hunter deciding that he needs to be dealt with.  The movie then has a mid credit scene in which the symbiote merges with Eddie Brock and they become Venom.

The Venom movie then begins with Eddie Brock being a reporter at the Daily Bugle.  We meet this iteration of J Jonah Jameson for the first time.  Maybe he meets Spider-Man but Tom Holland only has to do voice work.  He doesn't like Spider-Man because Spider-Man refuses to talk to reporters.  It kind of makes sense that Spider-Mam would not want to do interviews because he has a bit of an accent.  What if somebody were to recognize his voice?

Anyway, we see the mid credit scene from Spider-Man Homecoming 2 again and Eddie Brock becomes Venom.  So now what?  He doesn't like Spider-Man but he doesn't hate Spider-Man.  Logically, he is going to want to make money as Venom so he is going to try to sell pictures of Venom to the Daily Bugle and publish interviews of Venom.

Now what?  Somebody has to find out that Eddie Brock and Venom are the same person.  Eddie loses his job at the Daily Bugle.  He attacks J Jonah Jameson as Venom but J Jonah Jamesson is saved by Spider-Man.  Again, Tom Holland only has to provide a voice over.  So then we have a lengthy Spider-Man versus Venom fight to make up for the fact that the movie is short on plot.  Venom goes to prison.  The end.

Not so fast.  The mid credit scene has Venom going to a high security facility.  Doctor Octopus, the Lizard, Electro and Sandman are already there.

Spider-Man Homecoming begins with a montage of Spider-Man fighting Doctor Octopus, the Lizard, Electro and Sandman separately intercut with scenes of their origins.  The scenes are reminiscent of Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, Amazing Spider-Man and Amazing Spider-Man 2 but with different actors.  

We then have Mysterio break into the facility housing Doctor Octopus, the Lizard, Electro, Sandman and Venom.  Mysterio then becomes the leader of the Sinister Six.  

Most of the movie then deals with Spider-Man just being Spider-Man.  Perhaps he faces the members of the Sinister Six two or three at a time as they rob banks and then he faces them all as a group in the end.  Somehow I think he is going to need help.  Maybe the Falcon, Ant Man and the Wasp can show up.  It's a question of what Avengers are readily available after Infinity War.

Anyway, the Sinister Six go to jail.  I don't know what plans that Sony has for a Sinister Six movie.  I do know that the next logical step would be to introduce Norman Osborn in Spider-Man Homecoming 4 and then have him be the big bad for Avengers 5.  Maybe the Dark Avengers can be Vulture, Beetle, Moonstone, Blizzard, Abomination, Shocker and Scorpion.  The Avengers (including Spider-Man) fight and defeat the Dark Avengers and Norman Osborn goes to jail.  Maybe the government likes Norman Osborn's idea and they try it with the Sinister Six. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Over the course of six films we will have had Green Goblin (three times), the Vulture, the Shocker, Venom, Sandman, Doctor Octopus, Electro, the Tinkerer and the Lizard.  It's too bad the continuity is such as mess.  

I hope we see Kraven and / or Mysterio in the next Spider-Man movie.  I don't want to see Venom in the Sinister Six.  I'm worried about Sony's plans for a Venom movie.  I hope they delay the Venom movie until July, 2020.  October, 2018 is too soon.  I also don't want Spider-Man Homecoming 2 (July, 2019) to exactly follow the plot of Spider-Man 3.  I'm torn.  

I'm also worried about Sony rushing to get to a Sinister Six movie.  I expect Spider-Man Homecoming 3 to feature the Sinister Six.  I hope they don't go ahead with the idea of Oscorp being behind the whole thing.  How about an opening credit sequence with Spider-Man fighting Doctor Octopus, Electro and Sandman one at a time and then have them all moved to a special facility for superpowered criminals and then Mysterio busts them out.  Come to think of it, it would make more sense for the other two villains to be Venom and Lizard because Vulture and Kraven don't really have superpowers.  

Okay.  That works. </TEXT>

"We are expanding the Spider-Man universe into the Sinister Six and Venom, so that we have Spider-Man movies every year," Pascal told Variety."

EDIT: Okay, so that article is three years old but Sony presumably still wants to put out Venom, Black Cat and Sinister Six movies.  The question is whether they can do this without diluting their brand and Marvel's brand.  Feige has probably already sent Amy a memo telling her that Venom and Black Cat will only work if they tie in with the Spider-Man movies and the MCU as a whole. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pitch Phase 4 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-22 14:05:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's 2020.  Avengers 4 and Spider-Man Homecoming have come and gone.

[1] MAY 2020

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3.  Yes, the actors are busy filming Infinity War but 2020 is still three years away and they are already talking about brininging back the current cast plus Adam Warlock.

[2] JULY 2020

Venom.  This movie is happening whether we want it or not.

[3] NOV 2020

Doctor Strange 2.  Scott Derrickson returns and introduces Nightmare and Clea.  Wong has a bigger role.  

[4] MAY 2021

Nova Corps.  Feige said that the titles to the Phase 4 movies would be "spoilers" so presumably the Nova Corps have a big role in Avengers: Infinity War.  Glenn Close returns as Irani Rael / Nova Prime.  John C. Reilly returns as Rhomann Dey.  Peter Serafinowicz returns as Denarian Saal.  New characters include Major Victory / Vance Astro, Quasar / Wendell Vaughn, Moondragon / Heather Douglas, Martyr / Phylla-Vell and Richard Ryder.  Obviously Phylla-Vell is going to be a Kree so the how and why she is working with the Nova Corp has to be explained.  I would tentatively have the Russo Bros direct depending on their schedule.

[5] JULY 2021

Spider-Man Homecoming 3.  Jon Watts returns for a second sequel.  If Kraven the Hunter and / or Mysterio appear in Homecoming 2 then this could be a Sinister Six movie.

[6] NOVEMBER 2021

Black Panther 2.  Ryan Coogler returns to direct the sequel.  It will probably end up being a trilogy.

[7] MAY 2022

Black Widow.  Peyton Reed is tapped to direct Black Widow.  It will be a heist movie involving Roxxon.  Natasha assembles a team consisting of herself, Ant Man, Wasp, Falcon, Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye.  Chris Evans cameos as Steve Rogers.

[8] JULY 2022

Black Cat and Silver Sable.  Presumably this is Sony's answer to the Catwoman / Harley Quinn movie.

[9] NOVEMBER 2022

Captain Marvel 2.  Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck return for another movie.  This assumes the first movie is a hit.

***

That's enough movies for Phase 4 so I'm now pitching Phases 4 and 5.

***

[10] MAY 2023

Spider-Man Homecoming 4.  Jon Watts is directing again and he introduces Norman Osborn as the main villain.  The movie sets up Avengers 5.

[11] JULY 2023

Avengers 5: Dark Avengers.  Russo Bros direct.  Norman Osborn assembles a team consisting of Abomination, Venom, Moonstone, Beetle, Shocker, Blizzard and Scorpion.  The current Avengers line up is Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Thor, Hulk, War Machine, Valkyrie and Doctor Strange.  Robert Downey Junior cameos as Tony Stark.

[12] NOVEMBER 2023

Doctor Strange 3.  Scott Derrickson returns in a story that has Doctor Strange fighting Baron Mordo.

[13] MAY 2024

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4.  James Gunn debuts a new Guardians team

[14] JULY 2024

Sinister Six.  Again, this would be Sony's answer to the Suicide Squad.

[15] NOVEMBER 2024

Black Panther 3.  Ryan Coogler returns to finish the trilogy.

[16] MAY 2025

Nova Corps 2.  Again, this assumes that people want yet another cosmic franchise from Marvel. 

[17] JULY 2025

Spider-Man Homecoming 5.

[18] NOVEMBER 2025

Captain Marvel 3.  Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck complete the Captain Marvel trilogy.

***

With the end of Phase 5, they need to say goodbye to the characters introduced in Phases 1-3 and continue with new characters.

***

[19] MAY 2026

Young Avengers.  Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel, Kate Bishop, Stature, Patriot, Vision.  Ms. Marvel would be introduced in a Captain Marvel movie.  Hawkeye, Black Widow, Falcon, Ant Man, Wasp, Captain Marvel and Captain America would appear as mentors.

[20] JULY 2026

Sinister Six 2.

[21] NOVEMBER 2026

Ms. Marvel.

[22] MAY 2027

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5.

[23] JULY 2027

Spider-Man Homecoming 6.

[24] NOVEMBER 2027

Nova Corps 3

***

And, finally, Phase 7.

***

[25] MAY 2028

Young Avengers 2.

[26] JULY 2028

Sinister Six 3.

[27] MAY 2029

Ms. Marvel 2.

[28] JULY 2029

Spider-Man Homecoming 7.

[31] MAY 2030

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6.

[30] JULY 2030

Young Avengers 3.

[31] NOVEMBER 2030

Ms. Marvel 3. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The movie I am looking forward to is Ant Man and the Wasp (and Hawkeye).  If it is successful then I want Marvel to go ahead with Black Widow (and Ant Man and the Wasp and Hawkeye, Falcon and Scarlet Witch).  The story writes itself: SHIELD is investigating Roxxon and they need a team they can disavow.  Officially, Ant 
Man, Hawkeye, Falcon and Scarlet Witch are still wanted because they sided with Captain America in Civil War.  Unofficially, they are working for SHIELD.  Perhaps Steve Rogers becomes Director of SHIELD and that's why he can't be on the mission. </TEXT>
