I know it doesn't make sense, but neither does does this show. 

And he did take everything from her. Her brother, almost her father, her world and love of her life. 

I think she has kidnapped Iris, kept her somewhere and has been impersonating as Iris this whole time. And at the end she will kill real Iris. Making her Savitar.

Or I guess it could be future Barry, who knows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Barry wakes up. He doesn't have powers. Finds out he's a research head at mercury labs on futuristic technology.

His mother comes to take him for lunch. He asks about his father and learns his father is in Coast city as in charge of government hospital and been having trouble visiting them since the incident. They have a nice lunch and a heart to heart. 

After lunch Barry goes to star labs and requests to see Harrison Wells. He's declined at first but he's allowed when he mentions the particle accelerator plans. 

Barry and Harrison have a conversation about the particle accelerator when suddenly they hear the sounds from the outside. And before they could react, they are intervened by slades men and caught. 

Slade enters. Tells Harrison he's killing him because he invented the anti mirakuru syrum. And now that slade has improved his formula, and  Harrison was one of few people who could crack it. So he needs to take care of few people including Harrison. Slade then kills Harrison while Barry is on the floor dizzy. 

Barry starts to forget things from original timeline. When slade leaves, Barry meets murder investigation in charge Joe West and his partner Fred Chyre. He comes to know Joe knows him as the scrowny child of his friend. He learns that they do not get along but still have orders to work together. Barry says "classic captain Patel" under his breath. When they ask Barry why he was there, he tells weird reason and leaves. 

He gets home and tells his mom he needs to visit Star city to meet a friend . She asks him why he called starling city as star city. And it's not safe there since it's not much of a city remaining. 

Which he searches and finds out about the undertaking. And how when it got impossible to contain slades men, ARGUS nuked the city. Since there's not been much left of the city once it was. 

He tells her he needs to go there and meet someone. She tells him that he needs to stay away from that city because it is dangerous and there are thugs, thieves and vigilantes there. 

And when curious, she tells him about the rumor she heard about this Vigilante called Arrow. Barry says he needs to go and leaves central city. 

In the end scene, we see Arrow following a man of slade. Then the Arrow fights him. Just when slades soldier is about to kill the Arrow, we see Malcolm interrupt and shoot slades soldier with arrows. 

The Arrow says she had it under control. End episode 1.
