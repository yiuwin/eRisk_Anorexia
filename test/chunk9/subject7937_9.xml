	<TEXT> Also one helpful step can be that search for stores in your locality or city. I've often found that the prices are, if not much, a little cheaper. 

Just do an extensive research and then buy your parts. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need help with being better at PVP. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-15 15:54:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So the other day I was at the arena. I use a greatsword build as I enjoy it the most. 

I came up against a player with a greatsword. He was very good. Better than me at least. I ended up being matched with him around 4-5 times. He always won. So I sent him a friend request on Steam and praised him for his skill. 

He gave me a suggestion of playing PVP "unlocked". Also whatever PVP videos I watch most of them the player plays unlocked. Is there a benefit to play unlocked? I tried it and naturally got rekt. 

Also I am very bad at parrying. Any tips for that too? 

Thank you for your time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very good Skeleton ! 

I feel though you should have done your first playthrough without summons. Solaire is fine but other players are sometimes too overpowered. I'm sad you missed the feeling of being stuck on a boss for 4 days and then beating it . Try summonless in NG+. </TEXT>
