	<TEXT> Reddit will not "force-subscribe" you to any subreddits other than the defaults when you created the account.

If you have [reddit gold](https://www.reddit.com/gold/about) or if you use [RES](/r/enhancement), there'll also be a checkbox - near the one to select/hide your flair - with which you can enable/disable custom CSS for individual subreddits.

 There is also a pinterest "test" post, but for some reason this and other pinterest submissions are automatically removed. (pinterest post here)

 Despite the code for both being functionally the same, only one is being removed. (neither should) My guess is it's a site-wide thing not related to AM, -or- somehow another part of the script is leaking into #5, but what is going on?

Your guess is correct. The sitewide spamfilter generally catches any links to Facebook or Pinterest (among other domains), likely because they have been or can be abused by spammers. </TEXT>

If so, how should such issues be reported?

View counts seems like an interesting addition, though I agree with others that they should be deemphasized compared to the post score.

Making "users here now" more accurate (and less open to abuse) is also good.

Making subreddit traffic pages mod-only seems like an odd choice, even if they're not totally accurate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I assume your comments were downvoted. Karma isn't 1:1 with post/comment scores, and your karma can take a while to update. [This comment of yours](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5m2faq/67_year_old_ric_flair_deadlifts_400_pounds_woooooo/dc0r087/?context=3) from 4 months ago has over 50 downvotes, so I'm guessing that's the cause of most of the negative karma. [This recent comment of yours](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/6ayax3/george_soros_2017_the_deleted_interview_that_he/dhic8fg/?context=3) was also downvoted, but you posted that after you made this thread. </TEXT>

(When I click the "multireddit of my subscriptions" link, I get this error:

 #Error 756 Too long request string

 Too long request string

...but I know that's because I'm subscribed to (way) too many. You seem to be getting a different error, which suggests that it's not because of the number of subreddits/length of the link.) </TEXT>
