	<TEXT> Here is my issue: Its the wrong solution.

Our tax system needs an overhaul, not a  tweak.  The top 10 percent of earners earned [32 percent of all income but paid 40 percent of all taxes](http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/how-much-of-a-fair-share-do-canadas-top-earners-pay-you-might-be-surprised).  They're already paying their fair share.  This is another lazy solution that misses the big issue.  Our top marginal rate is already second highest highest in the G7.  That **is not the issue**.

Tax rates for the one percent is at 29 percent as of this statistic (since increased to 33 percent), but the rate they [actually paid came out to 19.7 percent](http://www.taxfairness.ca/en/news/close-tax-loopholes-make-taxes-fairer-and-simpler).  The problems get even worse when you go in further though.  The "one percent" is a misleading term.  The cutoff is slightly above $225,000 a year.  The median one-percenter made $313,000.  So while someone making those amounts is certainly doing well, you can't throw them in with CEO's making $20 Million and act like they're the same.  The real issue comes down to more like the 0.01% (the people earning well over $5 Million a year).  They earn money from different methods that allow them to take advantage of lucrative tax loopholes (like the stock option loophole, for example).  A $300K earner still makes the vast majority of their money from their job most likely, and does not take advantage of the same loopholes.

They can also hide money in off-shore accounts, something a $300k earner is not doing, but a $5 M+ earner very possibly is.

So the problem isn't that our tax rate isn't high enough.  It's plenty high already.  Its getting the ultra-wealthy to actually pay the tax rate they're supposed to in the first place.

Charlie Angus doesn't much care about all that nuance though.  So instead of raising the top tax rate even further, while leaving the problem fully intact, lets try a different solution:

- Raise the federal income tax exemption, possibly to $15 to $18 K (I haven't done the math though).  Not only is this fair, it will dis-porportionally help low-income people the most.
- Eliminate tax loopholes for wealthy.  There is quite a few of them.  The Liberals actually had the right idea, [before they decided to drop it for some reason](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-option-deduction-tax-rate-1.4030442).
- Prosecute off-shoring aggresively.  Its likely we are losing [$6 to $8 Billion a year in tax revenue from off-shore accounts](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2016/04/04/how-offshore-tax-havens-are-costing-canada-billions-of-dollars-a-year.html). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, no one really "needs" to earn more than $100,000 a year at MOST (and even 100k is likely way too high).  That's an abritrary point.

Its about two questions: 1) Is it fair?  2) Is it effective?

I think the answer is no to both.

Just because you set a cap doesn't mean that wealth is getting re-distributed to lower incomes.  Every way I can I can see it, the capital (and the associated tax dollars) would be more likely to be redistributed to another country.  That doesn't help anyone.

I think the Scandanavian countries have shown we have proven and effective techniques to deal with income inequality that are much more reasonable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe firmly in government intervention here, but I disagree entirely with that idea.

1) The government would be seriously over-stepping its boundaries.  They can determine how much they choose to tax in taxes, but what right does a government have to tell someone how much they're allowed to earn?  But more importantly

2) That is a completely unworkable policy.  For a CEO earning $50 Million, do you think he is honestly just going to forfeit $45 Million a year?  Or is there a *very* high chance he moves him and his millions of tax dollars elsewhere?  (And the 1% payed over [20% of all income taxes](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-rich-1-tax-income-1.3301268))

For a multinational corporation, why would you put any top-end management in Canada if you can avoid it anymore?  Finding the same level of talent would now be more difficult, retaining it even harder.

	<TEXT> Ive collected a few quotes from the Wikipedia article that I feel best summarize the exploit.  Its even crazier than I could make the title sound:

He formed a plan to fly a small aeroplane to Tibet, crash-land it on the upper slopes of Everest, and walk to the summit. It was a bold plan; a solo flight halfway across the world would have been a significant undertaking for the best aviators of the day, while no mountaineer of the time would have contemplated a solo ascent of Everest  a feat which was not to be achieved until 1980. A practical problem was posed by the fact that Wilson knew nothing about either flying or mountaineering, so he set out to learn these.
His preparation for the mountaineering challenge that lay ahead was even worse than his preparation for the flight. He bought no specialist equipment and made no attempt to learn technical mountaineering skills, such as the use of an ice axe and crampons. Instead, he spent just five weeks walking around the modest hills of Snowdonia and the Lake District before he declared himself ready.[12]
Ignoring the Air Ministry's ban, Wilson finally set off on 21 May, and remarkably, and in spite of the best efforts of the British government, he succeeded in reaching India two weeks later. On his arrival in Cairo his permission to fly over Persia had been withdrawn. Undeterred he flew on to Bahrain, where he was refused permission to refuel on the orders of the British consulate, which explained as all the easterly airstrips within his aircraft's range were in Persia, he could not be allowed to continue. He was allowed to refuel when he agreed to retrace his route and return to Britain, but once airborne he turned his plane towards India. The airstrip at Gwadar, the most westerly in India, was not actually within his aircraft's range, but almost precisely at its limit; after nine hours in the air Wilson arrived with his fuel gauge reading zero.[15] Having arrived safely in India he continued across the country, but his flight ended in Lalbalu when the authorities reiterated that he would not be allowed to fly over Nepal, and impounded his plane to prevent him from trying.[14]
 Completely inexperienced in glacier travel, Wilson found the trek up the Rongbuk Glacier extremely difficult and constantly lost his bearing and had to retrace his steps. He showed his lack of experience when he found a pair of crampons at an old camp, which would have helped him tremendously, but threw them away.[18] After five days and in worsening weather he was still two miles short of Ruttledge's Camp III below the North Col. He wrote in his diary "It's the weather that's beaten me  what damned bad luck"
The next day he stayed in bed. His last diary entry was dated 31 May, and read simply "Off again, gorgeous day".[19]
 
It should also be noted that he did this in order to prove the magic of fasting and prayer to cure disease. </TEXT>

I don't really understand.  Just because its not dispatchable doesn't mean it can't, won't and isn't helping us meet our current energy needs.  So I don't find that failing to meet the dispatchable definition should exclude it.  But to each their own.

They considered all equally.  So either they didn't consider failures of coal either, or they did.  My guess is the pollution from "burn" is neglible.  If you have good evidence otherwhise I'm open to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, so since wind is not dispatchable it doesn't count?  You're excluding all wind energy since it's not dispatchable, which would make a comparison impossible.

Okay, so [here is a source for air pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_wind_power#Pollution_.26_effects_on_the_grid).

Relevant quote:

As far as total pollution costs in economic terms, in a comprehensive 2006 European study, alpine Hydropower was found to exhibit the lowest external pollution, or externality, costs of all electricity generating systems, below 0.05 c/kWh. Wind power externality costs were found to be 0.09 - 0.12c/kW, while nuclear energy had a 0.19 c/kWh value and fossil fuels generated 1.6 - 5.8 c/kWh of downstream costs.

Additional quotes:

Wind turbines when isolated from the electric grid produce negligible amounts of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, mercury and radioactive waste when in operation, unlike fossil fuel sources and nuclear energy station fuel production, respectively.

However, to your credit:

With the construction phase largely to blame, wind turbines emit slightly more particulate matter(PM), a form of air pollution, at an "exception" rate higher per unit of energy generated(kWh) than a fossil gas electricity station("NGCC"),

So while they do result in slightly higher emissions of one particular kind of pollutant, the overall effect is far lower because emissions from the rest are negligible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, that's why wind can only provide a portion of your power needs, not all of it.

And I don't much get the scrubber thing.  Wind doesn't release those pollutants, why would it need a scrubber?  And a scrubber improves the situation, but far from solves it.  It's not like you slap a scrubber on all of a sudden coal is clean and good to go.  It just makes a very dirty energy source slightly less dirty.

	<TEXT> Well, I wouldn't say its extremely clean.  It's certainly better than coal, but it also produces far more methane as well.  Certainly not as good as many alternatives.  Personally, I would prefer to use nuclear.

Just from [some research](https://psmag.com/think-biomass-not-natural-gas-14357b2a2949), it should be noted that not all biomass necessarily involves cutting down forests.  The relevant quote: "It could include agricultural waste, forest residue, municipal wastes, construction debris, organic effluent from sewage, organic compostable material now going to landfills, second-generation biofuels and some energy crops such as corn and perennial grasses grown on marginal lands." 

So it would largely depend how you sourced the biomass as well. </TEXT>

Only thing I wouldn't really agree with is saying coal declined slightly, [according to this](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_1_1) electricity production from coal has dropped by 40% in the past 10 years, I think that's pretty significant.  But I doubt we'll see the trend continue as much under Trump.

	<TEXT> I used a Wikipedia article so you could see data from a variety of sources, including the EIA.

He is claiming, without source, that the EIA is intentionally manipulating data to make cool look expensive and wind look cheap.  The EIA is a highly respected authority on this, and that accusation is ridiculous.

I was incorrect about my original assertion about coal plants, I do apologize for that one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If wind was a smart solution financially, all of the large companies, such as Dynergy, would be installing them left and right.

Ah, I got news for you.  [See here](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=25172).  Wind and solar accounted for the *majority* of installed capacity last year.  They **are** installing them left and right.

How is Dallman Unit 4 not an expansion of the Dallman Power Station?  It's the 4th unit of an existing power plant.

LCOE takes all of that into account over the lifetime of a plant.  I don't know what to say about your claim they intentionally manipulated data to make coal look expensive, thats just simply ridiculous.

The LCOE's are entirely accurate and very thorough numbers.  The only factor they don't account for is variability. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple expansion units on existing plants, but not one new plant.  I said no new plants were built.

And that is 100% false.  [Source here](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm) or [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source?wprov=sfla1) All factors considered, coal costs around $100/Mwh.  Natural gas costs $53.80 and wind $55 without subsidies.  Solar costs $64.50.  Coal is by no source the cheapest, or even close, source of new electricity in the US. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My guess is they're going to put forward Bernier most likely, get soundly defeated in the election, and then be forced to go soul searching again.  But until they drift back towards the center, I can't see them seeing a big electoral success.  

Who knows, maybe I'm totally wrong.  But regardless, it really does astound me that people try and classify Chong as a Liberal.  Honestly, if you removed the carbon tax no one would say that.  Meanwhile, other Conservative candidates advocate for giant subsidies for EVs, industry by industry regulation, and tax rebates.  Even though those are all bigger government solutions, I've never heard the Liberal label thrown at Scheer, Alexander, or O'Toole.

It seems to me much of this derives from the Conservatives deciding they were resolutely anti-Carbon pricing, for whatever reason.  Chong crossed that line. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree on Harper and Obama largely.

Obama took climate change very seriously and did his best to take action.  Harper did not.  Obama layed off the war on the drugs somewhat ( and 1st President in a long time to leave with less prisoners than when he was elected).  Harper supported the war on drugs and was tough on crime.

Obama actually supported an array of other ideas that he simply stood no chance of passing because of the Republicans (free community college for example).  Harper would have scoffed at that concept.

I actually believe Obama would defined himself as clearly to the left of Harper had he governed in a different climate. </TEXT>

Ontario's grid was badly mismanaged in a number of ways, and they benefit from natural hydro resources most places don't have and a pre-existing reliance on nuclear.  There are FAR better examples out there for low carbon electricity that have made more effective transistions.  California is one example.

Even go over to Nova Scotia, almost 20% of their electricity comes from wind alone and they have transitioned much more smoothly and kept electricity prices relatively low. </TEXT>

There is already a lot of interest in buying the truck because of substantially lower operating costs!

And I do wish that people understood the enormous indirect costs that come with conventional energy sources as well.  It may not show up directly on your electricity bill, the costs are very significant none the less and you still end up paying them. </TEXT>

If the Speaker stops a question that is ridiculous or irrelevant, the Conservatives (or any opposition party for that matter) will scream censorship until the cows come home.  Meanwhile, if they allow a partial answer (or a very long answer or the like), even though the answer was often no more unfair than the question asked, they will get the same treatment.

So instead, they opt to stay out of things entirely to avoid criticism or allegations of bias. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The upper-middle class gets probably the worst end of things though.  Even with every type of tax factored in, they [pay proportionally more than their share](http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/how-much-of-a-fair-share-do-canadas-top-earners-pay-you-might-be-surprised).  The top 10 percent of earners earn 32 percent of all income but paid 40 percent of all taxes.  It doesn't segment it any further than that, but my guess is if you could, you would find that not all of the top 10 percent of earners make the top tax bracket, so some are actually dragging that average down.  Meanwhile, my guess is if you could get separate the few ultra-wealthy Canadians out, they would get away with far lower tax rates from a variety of techniques available only to them (off-shoring for example).

But my point was more if you're going to raise taxes to pay for more social housing for example, why did only the top tax bracket rise?  Why was that one demographic responsible for all of the costs when they were already paying a higher proportion?  Why can't someone that makes $70,000 a year contribute more too?  Or, crazy thought, why can't all Canadians contribute slightly more? </TEXT>
