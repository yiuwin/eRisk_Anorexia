	<TITLE> how do I be nice to my entitled aunt?! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-07 16:12:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>         My aunt acts like an entitled brat. She has 3 kids(which I'll get to in a moment), doesn't work, and acts like the world revolves around her. Her kids are 21(younger than me), 3 and 1, yet she lets them run rampant and act crazy. She doesn't control her 3 year old and when she does it's too late. Her 21 year old acts like a bitch and is becoming exactly like my aunt, entitled and all! My aunt doesn't work and hasn't since 04, for a "shoulder injury." 
       A few weeks ago my aunt called my mother to see if I was actually sick when I couldn't drive my cousin around. Yet... you have a car, you can drive her around?! She is so unbelievably loud and obnoxious. Seems to believe the world revolves around her and such. My cousin also brings around her bf to all functions and gets so bitchy when anybody talks to him. It's pathetic. 
So... HOW DO I BE NICE?! </TEXT>
