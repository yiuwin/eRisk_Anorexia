	<TEXT> One kid brought a tumbleweed to class.  Not because of any scheduled presentation, but because she thought it was the biggest, roundest tumbleweed she'd ever saw.  Found it in a ditch on her walk to school.  Dragged it all the way down multiple carpeted hallways into a carpeted room, leaving thousands of burrs stuck along the way.  Then proceeded to try and convince a class of middle schoolers how awesome this tumbleweed was.

Admittedly, it was huge.  So was the grief over all those burrs stuck in the carpets. </TEXT>
