	<TITLE> Gift Card Balance Removed? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I recently purchased a gift card off of someone for a discounted price. It was about $100. I know this is against the TOS but it seemed too good to turn down. However, just this morning, I've been notified that the balance on this card got removed due to fraudulent activities. I'm just wondering if there's anything i could do to solve this problem cause the dealer is gone now so i can't contact him. Thanks  </TEXT>
