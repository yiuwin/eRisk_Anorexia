Blame the icon that read "Windows 10 Upgrade Advisor", instead of "...Update Advisor".

Anyhoo, I've tried, thrice, to update W10 on my laptop, but it always gets stuck at 99% for hours. Like today, I started updating around noon. By 11PM it was still 99%, as it had been since at least 7 or so.

I'm figuring the problem is the massive jump in builds. So, what's the best way to update from 10240 to 14393? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-12-09 18:03:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My old iPod Touch (4G, IIRC) ended up suffering from battery bloat, meaning I had to keep it plugged in constantly, and died wholly back in September.

When my new iPT is on AC, it shifts from "100% Charged" to "Batter Charging" for an extended period. Like, I can be texting and feeling the back getting warm because it's in "Battery Charging" mode, not "100% Charged" mode. I am aware that it does do minor discharges occasionally, but I figure they probably shouldn't be enough to cause it to heat up like it's charging from 20%, no?

To "solve" the BC issue, I unplug the cable (sometimes I have to rotate it) and plug it back in and it'll trip back to "100% Charged".

Please help. This is freaking me the hell out and I don't have another $300 (I didn't really have it in the first place, but a shout-out goes to my aunt who gave me combo late birthday/early Christmas money to recoup the cost) to replace it.

Help!
Please assist!
Ketchup! (Just a squirt?)

Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty were great movies. (Saw HL, only heard good things about ZDT)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I tend to keep my iPod Touch 6G plugged in and running off AC from my computer or my game console.

What tends to happen is it will randomly change from saying "100% charged" to "battery charging" and it will get really warm.

Is the battery defective? Is the brand new (Sept 2016, same age as iPod) cable defective? Or is it supposed to do that?

I'm asking because my previous iPod Touch 5G ended up suffering from battery bloat and couldn't hold a charge for more than a literal three minutes before dying so I'm wanting to avoid that, since I don't have the funds for yet another new iPod. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unless they're anagrams or a secret code or something, 90% of it just gibberish.

Like, at the top of K-2SO's it says:
 * FKCP KS      AH
 * WDJD        KDH
                   LZ
 * (stuff)
 * DRAK
 * "Beat back the rebels"

and over Diego "not Biggs" Luna, the fourth line reads: "ODDBOERBBQ CCDB MAS"

So, unless a group of quirky late 19th century Dutch inhabitants of South Africa are going to be hosting a cookout, it's probably just gibberish.

There are a few legitimate quotes, as people have noted as as I showed above.

TCW does take a little bit to get in to, but if you watch in chronological order, it makes it even better. Yes, it was a bit slow to start, but by the time it gets to the last eps of season one (especially the Battle of Ryloth), heartbreak starts.

	<TEXT> I more take it that, like modern missiles, proton torpedoes have thrust vectoring.

Like they said during the briefing, the 2m wide port is too small a target, "even for a computer". Luke, though, was a self-proclaimed womp-rat bulls-eyer, and they're about 2m.

So I'd Red Leader's torps missed because they missed the target because he relied on the computer.

Meanwhile, Luke's got his in, on no small account due to luck, which seems to follow the Core Team closely, but also because he didn't use the computer and manually aimed them, probably with some help from the Force. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. As far as I'm aware, all games are available digitally.
* advantage: they "pre-load" if your XBox is set to "always on"
* disdvantage: you can't get the physical goodies (statues, etc)

2. You need the disc. It installs the full game, but the disc is needed. It's probably a DRM thing or something.

3. Yes (see 2)

4. It varies based on game size and connection speed. If you're installing Halo: The Master Chief Collection (~60GB) at 10mbps, it's gonna be eons; if you install at 10,000,000mbps, it's gonna be instant. Often, though, games install certain elements (usually campaign, etc.) first, so you can start playing even when it's still installing.

5. It's permanent.

6. I get a couple weeks out of mine, if my internal calendar is right, and I game for a few hours each day, more on weekends.

And, personally, I'd recommend getting a Kinect. I love mine. It can be a bit finicky sometimes ("No, I said 'XBox, go to Netflix', not 'XBox, go to The Crew" or whatever; it's probably partly that I am not the clearest speaker), but it's handy if I want to pause and not have to wait for my controller to restart.

Also, if you know the "metadata" name of the game (e.g. Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China is "ACCGame (Shipping)") (it's the green title on the tile when your Kinect is listening), you can say "XBox, go to 'ACCGame shipping' or 'XBox, go to YouTube', 'XBox, snap Achievements', and it'll open it for you. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Rogue One theory (Spoilers only if you haven't read any press releases, seen any trailers or panels, etc) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-18 08:12:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know right now everyone is all "Snoke is Plagueis/Palpatine/Millicent" and "Jyn Erso/Jan Ors" right now, but I've had this theory for a while and haven't seen it posted her, so here goes:


My theory is that Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) is Lor San Tekka.

Evidence:

* Max von Sydow and Mads Mikkelsen are both well-known actors (MM especially after *Casino Royale*)

* Mads Mikkelsen is Danish; Max von Sydow is Swedish - both unequivocally Scandinavian

* MM will be 51 this year, MvS turned 87 - an age difference of 35-36 years, right about the same time between RO/ANH and TFA (34 years)

* from Wookieepedia:

[Lor] San Tekka was a seasoned traveler and explorer on the remote fringes of the galaxy

After the rise of the Galactic Empire and the destruction of the Jedi, San Tekka never believed the Emperor when he branded the Jedi as traitors.

and

[Erso's] knowledge of the universe led both the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic to seek him out.

Same way the FO and Resistance were after LST. (I admit, this may be a bit straw-graspy, but just go with it)

If Galen was a fully committed Imperial, would he really have leaked info to the Rebellion, which was born from the remnants of the Republic loyalists?

* Especially with the oversight of the Story Group, there has been a lot more interconnectivity between, well, everything.

* Considering how well-known MM and MvS are, and since *Star Wars* really doesn't seem like the sort to do one-off [stunt casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_casting)...


The only evidence against I can immediately come up with is "not everything is connected".

Anyway, that's my theory. Take it as you will. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just wanted to briefly share my story of when I met Barry Jenner.

I met him at my first convention, STLV 2004. Really friendly guy, especially considering my brother and I were 12 and 13 at the time, respectively. We got his autographs and, I believe, a photo with him (he was in the autograph room.)

We chatted for probably a good ten minutes. My brother and I talked with him about what rank Adm. Ross was and the pip system.

He talked with us about the backstory he created for Adm. Ross (that he had lost a kid to the Dominion).

He was a genuinely friendly guy and I'll always remember those ten minutes we got to talk with him.

I also remember that, just a few days later, I caught a few minutes of the JAG episode he was in (the one where they're trying to recover the stolen computer for the *Zumwalt*-class prototype).

RIP Barry Jenner.

Thank you. :) </TEXT>

Ant-Man director Peyton Reed has revealed that the film originally ended with Carson being apprehended by Ant-Man: "At the end of the movie he gets away and has these Cross particles, and there was a sequence where Ant-Man has an encounter with him. But then for a couple reasons, it felt like maybe we should leave those particles out there. In that original thing, he took Martin Donovan out and got the particles."

Think, though, about what Han, Finn, Chewie, etc. (the "Team") had to do to "sneak in". They had to drop out of hyperspace *in atmosphere*. Half a second too soon, they're outside the shield; half a second too late and they've plowed themselves into a planet at FTL velocities causing who-knows-what damage to space and hyperspace. Even so, they still arrived with a crash-landing.

Then, they had to cross a frozen tundra, mostly, if not wholly, on foot just to actually get into the base - a large part of which was based on luck because Finn had happened to work sanitation at the base.

Then they had to make their way through the heavily-staffed base, snag Phasma without her, or anyone, noticing and then drop the shield.

Basically, their plan was overwhelmingly dependent on blind luck.

Then, even though the shield was down, they still had the thermal oscillator to take care of. 

They had to blow it up from the inside with heavy explosives, which, even then, just barely cracked it open enough for Poe to get in.


The thing with the Death Star is that they grossly underestimated the threat of the fighters. Plus, it had the infamous fatal flaw. They, especially Tarkin, were cocky. 

 ...they're so small they're evading our turbolasers.

The DS was meant for planet-killing and anti-capital shooting matches, not fighters.

One of Tarkin's officers even warned him that they had figured out what they were trying to do and suggested evacuating. In the comics, Tagge complains about how many Supers they could've built with the resources of the DS.

If they had, instead, used a a Supers and a few SDs to occupy Alderaan, and just one Super to launch an air and ground assault on the Massassi temple, ANH probably would've turned out very differently.

Plus, who's to say they didn't have a small flotilla of SDs docked in the station? But when dealing with 30 small fighters, launching SDs is a waste of time, energy and manpower, plus, imagine trying to very, very quickly corral several thousand troops from various places across a 120km diameter sphere (a little over 900,000 cubic km) in minutes, plus power up, systems checks, etc. It probably would've been at least a few hours before the first SDs were able to launch, and, even then, SDs, like the DS, are made for slugging matches with other capitals, not anti-fighter work.

As seen in TFA Cross-Sections, the FO learned from the Empire's mistakes. Like the *Finalizer* had a primary bridge with a reduced profile, as well as point-defense turrets next to the bridge, as well as a secondary bridge located further down in the ship, near the front of the superstructure, well-defended by loads of guns.

Plus, Starkiller Base is a *fucking planet*. It would generally take either stupidity, balls, or both, to attack a fucking battle~~station~~planet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was a "Greetings, fellow kids" reference. Sorry. XD

But because Han was the closest thing to a father Rey had had in a decade or more, her pain was probably rather intense, and Leia felt that. *Bloodline* and *Life Debt* pretty much all but state that Leia's Force strength is more empathic, rather than telepathic like Luke and Rey are.

Chewie is Han's best friend, but is also a consummate professional, a soldier, and knew their line of work was dangerous. Based on basic triage rules, Finn was priority number 1 and they might need a 7-foot-tall super-strong waking carpet to help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The new XBox One S supports 4K TVs and supports HDR via HDR10.

Is HDR10 the HDR equivalent of HTML4 vs HTML5?

And, what benefits does 4K have over 1080p?

And, I guess while we're here, what advantage does 1080p have over SD?


As tech-savvy as I tend to be, when it comes to TVs and such, I'm a Baby Boomer at 25. I watch TV via "upconverted" SD (it's an SD composite, not component, output from the box in HDTV-friendly widescreen mode), probably like watching a DVD in a Blu-Ray player. And my DVD/VCR combo is input into the TV via composite as well. And, honestly, when watching an episode of a show on Netflix via Chromecast, versus watching the broadcast version, I really don't notice any difference, so you can see why 4K eludes me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From JJ Abrams:

At least, thats what it looks like. Speaking with /Film, Abrams says that it was purely his mistake that led to that interpretation:

"Had Chewbacca not been where he was, you probably wouldnt have thought of it. But because he was right there, passed by Leia, it felt almost like a slight, which was definitely not the intention.

Abrams intention was that Chewie was busy trying to get Finn help, while Rey and Leia had a connection in the Force moment:

"That was probably one of the mistakes I made in that. My thinking at the time was that Chewbacca, despite the pain he was feeling, was focused on trying to save Finn and getting him taken care of. So I tried to have Chewbacca go off with him. And [meanwhile to] focus on Rey, and then have Rey find Leia and Leia find Rey. The idea being that both of them being strong with the Force and never having met, would know about each other  that Leia would have been told about her beyond what we saw onscreen and Rey of course would have learned about Leia. And that reunion would be a meeting and a reunion all in one, and a sort of commiseration of their mutual loss" </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since December, I've been trying to figure out just how the hell you access the #2 hold and the freight loading area from the interior of the Falcon.

The #2 hold has the life support and shield generator systems, kind of important systems that, if something happens mid-flight or in combat, if you can't access them, you're screwed.

I can find no door, nor anywhere obviously a hidden door.

Directly starboard of the dejarik table is a structural wall with conduits, directly foreward is a bed, then port and aftward is the passenger section.

Unless the side of the bed nook opens or there is a secret panel in the cockpit access tunnel, I can find nothing.

Am I totally missing seeing a door/hatch? Or is it that there is no (marked) access to #2 hold from the interior of the Falcon? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About 3/4 of the way through S5 of Voyager.

Not as consistently good as DS9, but it trends towards "Better than I expected".

S1 is more hit-than-miss, S2 is more miss-than-hit, S3 is when it starts getting consistently good. S4 was really good, overall.

Even TNG had it's misses (pretty much all of S1, *Genesis*), but VOY really stabilizes in S3. It's just a matter of putting in the 40-something hours to get there. Once the Borg come in and Seven is introduced, things start picking up.

Plus, *Year of Hell*? I mean, that shit is *the* shit.

Oh. And the infamous *Threshold* isn't anywhere near as bad as it's made out to be. At least they *attempted* at something resembling an interesting plot. *Heroes and Demons* in S1 (1x12) is absolutely fucking pointless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can say with 99.9% assurance it's not.

The Borg have been in existence since at least the mid-to-late 1400s, and, by their own record, are thousands of years old.

Their home planet in the Delta Quadrant would've been the first to be assimilated. Since Altamid is deep in either the Alpha or Beta Quadrant, it can't be.

Also, as far as the tech goes, we already have a similar tech: the Internet. We can have multiple computers execute the same tasks in sync. This just applies it to bipedal AI drones of a sufficiently advanced tech level, like the Geth of *Mass Effect*.

Plus, the Borg have never been shown to be life-energy thieves. It would serve no goal in furthering their quest towards perfection.

As for the wormhole, it's just the most plausible theory, not fact. But ST does have a history of rogue wormholes, like the Barzan wormhole and the orange stripey one  made of late 1970s computer effects the 1701 got caught in in TMP.


In the ENT era (and early UFP), the Delphic Expanse was about as far out as anyone had gone (50ly, IIRC). Canonically, we don't know, but in the novels the whole of the Romulan War was fought in Earth/Coalition territory, within a few dozen ly of Earth.

So, if the Franklin ended up in a wormhole in 2164 (3 years after UFP was founded) and got flung even a mere (relatively speaking) 1000ly (~1% of the galactic diameter; IIRC, 2370s UFP is thousands of lightyears across) into A/B Quadrant away from Earth, they wouldn't be found for centuries, and if 2263 alt-UFP is just barely venturing into that neck of the woods, prime-UFP probably didn't get out there for at least another few years or decades and by then, maybe we had shields and such to effectively combat Krall and the swarm. Or, if not, a well-timed intentional warp core breach world do some nasty hurt. And if Krall was killed in the blast? Then nothing further would happen and it'd be another tragically list starship, </TEXT>
