	<TITLE> My parents told me this story about my older brother when he was little. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 13:03:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My brother is 5 years older than me, lets call him James. This happened when he was about 5-6 so if I was born, I was very young. I'm from Birmingham, UK, just in case anyway was interested. So, this was about 30 years ago now and back then my parents lived in a little flat, about 5 minutes from where they live now actually. At this time my mom was at home during the day while my dad was out working and every time he got home from work he'd knock the front door and my brother (about 5-6) would run up to the door and my dad would stick his hand into the letterbox an pull on my brothers arm pretending to be a monster and making noises, obviously without being able to see him... you see where this is going.
				
One day he gets home from work, knocks on the door and then sticks his hand in and starts pulling on my brothers arm and making noises. He then hears my mom about to open the door so he takes his hand out and as my mom opens the door he looks around like "where's James?". My mom then goes, "oh, he's been in bed all day he's sick"... 

They also told me that they way the flat is laid out there is no way he could have even got out of bed and back in without my mom seeing him as my dad said she opened the door as soon as he "let go" of his arm so my mom would have seen him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have gotten better with my inventory now :) I didn't realise I could arrange items by type in the box and combine items while in it too, makes it so much easier to see it all! 

I guess I mainly liked the IG because of the vault jump and just kind of stuck with it for a while. Apart from that I can't think of any other reason. I guess the reach is nice but I could live without it. In fighting games I do usually go for faster weapons with good reach but also something that's not going to be too weak. I'm quite open to weapon choices as long as it's not too crazy to use as a new player.

As for the armour I'm still confused with how all these stats work because there's so much to look for. When you say "you need 10 total points in a skill to activate it", I'm not quite sure what that "skill" is exactly on armour I'm looking for. Lastly, about matching armour - when I speak to "The Man" (blacksmith), and choose forge armour and go to chest I see "Velociprey Mail" and "Velociprey Vest". Can either of those chest items be worn with the rest of the Velociprey head/arms/waist/legs armour to make a full set? Is it just the name "Velociprey" that makes it all match?  </TEXT>

Also you say I'm only 10ish hours in so does it change much? Not that I want it to I just wondered how much it does as at the moment it just feels like "do this quest, now do this quest, now do this quest". </TEXT>

As for weapons and armour, I've only ever used the Insect Glaive which I find fun but I don't really use the Kinsect, shall I use another weapon? My armour just seems OK and I don't know how to get the best stuff.

**TL;DR: I need to prioritise my items/equipment and have a better understanding of what I want to aim for** </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've spent the first night playing with my first ever 4K TV on my PS4 Pro and I'm not blown away. The TV is a Samsung KU6000 model i got for 450. It looks nice and sharp but over all it just looks OK to me.

I have Horizon Zero Dawn and I'm playing with HDR on and it just sort of looks like the brightness and contrast has been changed a little. I've heard people going on about how good it looks with HDR but i honestly wouldn't know if it was on or off.

Also i feel like the TV isn't a smooth as it should be for the price I'm paying. Is this because my TV isn't good enough? Should i return it and go for something closer to the 1000 mark? And if i did would i literally go "wow, ok this is a proper 4K TV" ?...

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I play my PS4 the menu looks great and rich with colour and Horizon Zero Dawn looks amazing in game but if I press the PS4 home button while HZD is playing then the menu colour/richness gets washed out.

I've noticed it does this with the games that have HDR compatibility. Is this just how the TV handles it or is there something I'm doing wrong? </TEXT>
