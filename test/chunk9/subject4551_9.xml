	<TEXT> Given that there's a number of games during the international breaks, I'd love to hear a suggestion of when the AP final should be played. After all, the ECC final is a week after the AP regular season finishes. Then the AP semis are a week after that. I suppose you could move those forward if all four teams were available, but that may not be possible because of broadcasting agreements and whatnot... (Are their any top 14 games the same weekend?)

	<TEXT> I don't know, probably not! It just seems to me that in spirit, although I accept their "popiness" Blondie's roots - or certainly the stuff I'm familiar with - seems to be more disco than pop. 

And pop-punk, as far as I'm concerned, is a very different animal to what Blondie were - I mean, as others have said, the Ramones played pop standards, really, really quickly, and it's not hugely difficult to draw lines from them to NOFX to Offspring to Blink etc. If anything, you'd argue they were kind of more in keeping (musically) with the original punk, and it's the likes of say, At The Drive-In or Refused who are much closer to metal, arguably, than they are punk. At least to my ears.  </TEXT>
