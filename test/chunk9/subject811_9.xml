	<TEXT> Well, maybe if you'd been upfront about things we could have helped you out. Also there was a clear dedication to this sub over r/TWRP that we didn't want to get in your way. Now look at you guys! :)  

Peculiar how the rules changed about this AMA after you saw this comment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's so awesome! I'm glad you found us!  
I think they're still in the process of finding their sound so all the EP's sound a bit different. Still a great bunch of albums though. :)  
Feel free to stick around. The band likes to pop by the sub every now and then! (u/TWRPband) </TEXT>

And I have [all my CD's framed too](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2627ouWEAEcKNa.jpg:large). I guess I'm going to have to draw a new poster to accommodate for Ladyworld. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TWRP discovered NSP years ago online. They connected and became friends because of their resemblance in creating silly music. A couple years ago they finally began to collaborate when they released "Baby, NYC" and "The Hit". (I can't link them as I'm on mobile but they're not too hard to find.). 

Anyway it boils down to, they're a big group of weird friends who collaborate fairly often now. Arin has even been featured on their past two EP's!  

Also as far as I know; from now on, all backing instrumentals for NSP music will be performed by TWRP (such as Cool Patrol and the entirety of Under the Covers). TWRP owes a huge chunk of their current success to GG/NSP and I know there are a lot of fans on this sub who dig them. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there /u/AwesomeEjm!  
Please check out #3 in the sidebar for the Rules!  

 Out of courtesy of the band, do not post any music or videos that pre-date "The Device (2012)".  

This won't count as a strike since you haven't posted any material but consider it a warning.   

[For more information, here is TWRP's input on their old persona/music.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TWRP/comments/4a52au/reminder_if_you_post_any_predevice_footageaudio/d0yi13l/)  

Thanks! </TEXT>
