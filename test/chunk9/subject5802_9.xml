	<TEXT> Add the only countries in Europe that people actually watch soccer from, Germany, UK, Spain, Italy, and France and you have a nation with roughly the same population as America.  People in that nation would not watch hardly any soccer outside of the borders.  

MLS will attract those kind of players when the money is big enough and there is most certainly enough money in this country to make that happen.  Like 5/10 of the richest sports franchises are NFL/NBA teams and both of those leagues are basically American only.  MLS doesn't need European eyeballs or money to be successful because America is big and rich enough alone 

That money and population grows even higher when you count Canada, which I forgot to </TEXT>

There's 350,000,000 people in America alone, which vastly dwarfs any European nation.  MLS can do just fine with only people in America watching lmao.  This is the dumbest argument I've ever seen against MLS.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well a lot of people like myself think it's really cool and unique.  It's a lot cooler to be named the Cherokee versus the tigers, bears, etc.  The imagery that goes along with it is really cool too, not to mention a lot of people in this country claim part native heritage.  At least in east in middle Tennessee where I'm from.  

Their names have survived and lasted for centuries in the names of towns and rivers, in the southeast, so I don't see why it's not ok to continue that tradition.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Naming your team after a Native American tribe, when they fully back the name and sponsor it, isn't "doing anything."  That's respecting them and their culture.  It's not like the redskins or something like that.  Florida state has been really successful with that iconography, with the backing of the Seminole tribe.

You're looking for a controversy that isn't there.  According to polls native Americans support the redskins more than any NFL team, therefore proving the only people that give a crap about that stuff are a very small but vocal native minority and white people who suffer form white guilt  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Knowing about the NFL is different than knowing about football.  Knowing about the NFL is knowing stats and who plays where.  Knowing football is knowing scheme, strategy, and other things.  Size definitely doesn't hurt, but all I'm alluding to is that it's not the most important thing.  It's not even close.  I've seen dozens of humongous and athletic dudes come from basketball and try to play football and none of them amount to anything.  Obviously there are exceptions (jimmy graham) but it's dumb to act as if just because lebron James is big and athletic he'd be a monster NFL TE.

Also I did not play Division 3 football and I don't know or care who zack Lowe.   </TEXT>
