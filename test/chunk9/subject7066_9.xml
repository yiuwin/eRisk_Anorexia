	<TEXT> I think I actually own the whole WoT series, but I haven't gotten around to starting it yet. This is also why I asked this question. I wanted to hear others thoughts on books because I basically just re-read all the books I know and love.
Stormlight archives is another I haven't heard of until now but it's now on my list of books to check out (after I finish with the current series I am reading of course) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, if you just google MapleStory, it should be one of the first links. It's a free to play game but it's honestly more pay to win. Although you don't need to pay to have fun with it. 
It looks very childish, I think anyways, but I found it to be quite a fun game with A LOT to do in it. 
Hit me up if you decide to play it and I could probably help you out a bit in it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome! I can't wait until I read it. Seems like I'll be reading a lot of new stuff now instead of re-reading everything I know I love. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That definitely sounds like something I would enjoy! I have a bunch of book series on the go that are still in progress so that's not a big deal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never watched the show, and I tried reading them a while ago. Read the first few chapters of the first book but it didn't really catch me like a lot of other books have. Were you hooked right away or did it take a bit? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MapleStory. It's a 2d side scrolling MMORPG. I used to play it so much (been playing almost since its release 12 years ago (I think)). Now I usually only play it when I'm really stoned.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So glad I asked this question, another I haven't heard of. Is it just one book, or a series?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I may be more in to TV shows but it's still not much of a list. 
Lately I've been into The Magicians (based off a book that I thoroughly enjoyed), anything Superhero-y (The Flash, Arrow, Daredevil, Jessica Jones type stuff), Other popular shows like How I met your mother, Doctor who, Big Bang Theory. 
Actually one of my favorite tv shows is Cheers (Old but good). 
I would list more but the hard drive I had them all downloaded on to is lost and it's getting hard to think of any besides the ones of watched most recently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't mind spending up to 500 or so on a good pair of headphones and the pxc 550's have some features that I find quite awesome. (Pause on taking off, swipe gestures on side, shut off/turn on when folding/unfolding). They are the limit to what I would spend though. </TEXT>
