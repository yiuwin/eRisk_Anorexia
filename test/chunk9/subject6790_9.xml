The city needs to crack down on the crime and thugs and ensure that they loose out if they are a problem.  There's enough people on the waiting list they can go elsewhere.
I'd much rather see my tax dollars go to fix the damn housing than fix the gardiner or extend the damn TTC to Scarb Town Centre. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Reminder about High Park Cherry Blossoms </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-23 16:06:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The reckoning is upon us once more.
The High Park Cherry Blossoms are almost in full bloom.
A reminder is needed.

Tips for Trip Planning:

Walk, Bike or Take the TTC: Parking is limited! With thousands of people visiting, roadways and parking lots are often overcrowded. Walk, bike or take public transportation if possible.

Be Litter Free: Many people visit during peak bloom, which can create a lot of garbage in the park. Please pack your garbage out with you, or go litterless by bringing food and drinks in reusable containers.

Take Only Photos and Memories: Please do not climb the Sakura trees, break branches or take blooms off the trees. These activities can cause damage and stress to the trees.

Stay on the Trail: If you venture into High Parks natural areas, please stay on existing trails to avoid trampling vegetation and compacting soil. The plants and animals will thank you for it!

https://www.highparknaturecentre.com/high-park-cherry-blossom-watch/planning-your-visit/

TTC Directions:

    From High Park Subway Station, walk south to the main entrance of High Park. Take West Road south to Cherry Hill, located west of the Grenadier Restaurant.
    From the 506 College Streetcar, get off at High Park Loop. Walk south on Parkside Drive until you reach the gates at Parkside Drive and High Park Blvd. Walk west to see a small grove of Sakura trees planted near the Adventure Playground / Zoo parking lot.
    From the 508 Lakeshore Streetcar, get off at the Colborne Lodge stop.  Walk north on Colborne Lodge Drive until you reach the Grenadier Restaurant, then head west.


And above all else, respect others and the environment.
Don't just see the Cherry Blossoms.
Go see the High Park zoo.  See the new Capybara babies!
If you enjoyed your visit to High Park, make sure to donate at the zoo. </TEXT>

How's that for a morning? You go off to work, some asshole steals your suitcase, chucks it on the subway track..

You get it back...  Hope there wasn't anything too important inside.  I can just imagine the discussion with the insurance company now... </TEXT>

Then again who the hell cares since in many people's eyes we're viewed as deviant and morally wrong so it looks good to see BLMTO hijack the narrative.  Sadly.

"High Parks famed capybaras, Bonnie and Clyde, have had triplets and now you can help name them!
We dont know whether the babies are male or female yet. Not even the vets will be able to tell until they are older. So you might want to consider names that work for any cute little capybaby.

Submitted names will be added to the long list. From this list, the Friends of High Park Zoo will create a short list. Then youll be invited to vote on your favourites. The long-list deadline is May 3. Voting on the short list will start May 8.

You can also help us renovate the capybara home! Donate to our High Park Zoo fundraising campaign.. After all, the family is expanding!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ended up having the same issue.  With Seven Dwarves Mine Train.
For a wedding dinner...

Went to the dinner.  Got a message on the app as we started the meal, which is when we would have been on the ride...
Tried to explain to the server we needed to go back out again so we could use our FastPass then come back in...
They said the only FastPass they not give was for Mine Train...

So we ordered.  Watched the clock tick by.  We were late getting seated which made it even worse...
The ride was down.  We now had magic passes that could be used for any ride.

Including Mine Train.

So we watched the app until MT opened again and then...
In we went once we'd recovered from Be Our Guest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One good thing that I thought of, is get in touch with the customer service department.  They are very helpful and would be able to help with your gesture.  That way you can buy all the balloons you need and give them away without looking too weird.  Not to mention the amount of baloons you're asking for might need a weight system to keep them down.  I remember reading an IAMA about it a while back.  There's even some blog posts about doing the Balloon job at Disneyland I read about.
Make sure you get in touch with the CS for sure though.  Disney can be magical, and would want to help I'm sure of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand the need to clean up the act but what fault of the lower staff is it the decisions made by the higherups?

Could you imagine the shitshow that would ensue if every election we had, every employee at city hall got fired and had to reapply for their jobs too?

Just seems like a bad idea.  Grab your popcorn. </TEXT>
