	<TEXT> As someone who appears to be a meme king. I will say this. I personally love this sub. Whenever a "big rugby event" comes along there's is always a post that seems to sum up my thoughts in a clear concise and in many ways funny fashion.

I love a good meme and in doing have embraced this in many of my posts. However if we all as a collective decide that it has gone too far then I would happily never post one on here ever again. I think we all personally have a good sense of what is a good post and a genuine 'shitpost' and I personally know that me and glove have our rugby hats firmly on. Either way we will contribute to this sub so it depends on what you prefer.

Obligatory all hail wallapy... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Martin Johnson. 

I know he had some [pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57bljsPw3pk) [hairy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCsPN1FyqKE) [times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S3prkjtp3I) as coach but he did do some great things for England.  

Blooded a whole host of players after 2007 such as, 

Chris Ashton  
Courtney Lawes  
James Haskell  
Dylan Hartley  
Ben Foden  

Just to name a few. He did manage to win England their first six nations in 2011 and beat Australia for the first time in yonks on their patch. I think he did a pretty good job apart from a few very significant losses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About to start work but will give a basic one line answer to that.

Whenever the player grounds the ball, the kicker must attempt to kick the conversation in line from where he grounded it. The closer to the centre the easier it is for the kicker to convert and gain those extra two points from the conversion.

Edit: 6 line. </TEXT>
