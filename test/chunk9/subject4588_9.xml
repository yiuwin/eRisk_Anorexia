	<TEXT> Hi r/personalfinance, I'm u/subject4588!

I'm a 23 year-old graduate student on the west coast. I just signed a lease for my own apartment at $1525 monthly without factoring into electricity, gas, and internet. It's not the cheapest option out there, but I have had shitty experiences with roommates and I would honestly rather pay extra for living alone. Also, the place is a 3-minute walk to my campus building; this meant I could not pass it up (housing goes fast in a college town!). 

Though I don't have any substantive reason to worry, I still am concerned about how I am going to live a cost-effective life (food, discretionary, transportation). I'll be making ~28,000 annually. I've never paid this much in rent and never had to *really* live by myself, but people whom I trust tell me that living alone is worth it. And for it to be true in my case, it must be sustainable.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: To add that if there is more context that is necessary, I will provide it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just saw a commenter who insinuated that this was clearly a joke. I would counter that it isn't so clear. As a black man in academia as well, I can relate to showing *no sign* that the white person I'm talking with just said something clearly racist to me. If my experience can serve as a guide, Dr. Hill might be internally going through something completely opposite to what we see him saying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have two dates that vie for the title.

**Date One** I went to a date at a Peruvian restaurant in Jamaica, Queens (coming from Harlem so it was a trip). I dressed to the nines, and I also shaved. I arrived a bit earlier than she did. When she finally got there, the first thing she said was "Oh my god! You're [subject4588]! You look fifteen!" I replied, "You look single", and I walked out.

**Date Two** This was a couple of months ago, in San Francisco. This date had actually been going well, until we got to my immigrant history. She asked me what language I spoke at home, and I said Swahili. Without missing a beat she asked: "Is that the one with the clicks in it?"

I have now taken a vow of monastic celibacy.
