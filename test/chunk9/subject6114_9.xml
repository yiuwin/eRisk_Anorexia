	<TEXT> Let me try to speculate Pop's logic. We were playing poorly. The Rockets were hot. At that point, it was a lot like game one. In game one, Pop pulled the starters and they responded well in game 2 by coming out strong. No one was playing well. Pop felt like it was more important to light a fire and get his guys ready for game 5, which is the game we really need to have. The Rockets dictated the pace from the gate. We weren't coming back. I think how we come out in game 5 will decide if Pop made the right decision. So far Pop has been ahead of us in recognizing how this team responds to different stimuli. He's been mostly right about line ups, and he was definitely right about Tony. I'll ride with Pop on this one against the mob.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MMA, especially women's MMA, is impacted by its youth and has only recently become somewhat viable as a career path. Remember, Liz Carmouche worked full time at the front desk of her gym while she trained to fight Ronda. Ronda fought people who had full time careers outside of MMA. You simply can't say the same thing about women's tennis, which has been visible and viable for centuries. 

You'll notice in other sports the level of competition has risen over the years. The disparity between the greats and the pack has lessened. What has happened is that the pack has risen to come closer to where the bar has been set. Humans collectively get better at things over time. As a result of  those occurrences, we see less variation, less baseball players hitting .400 or basketball players putting up Wilt Chamberlain numbers. The same thing is happening with MMA. We will see less Anderson Silvas and Ronda Rouseys. Those two set a bar and now we are seeing athletes meet and surpass it in skill, physical abilities and knowledge.

The biologist Stephen Jay Gould has some good [insights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZBh2ZbEo0I).

Edit: It's like I said something controversial here. Where is the leap? Think about anything that humans have done for a long time. Now think of the things that we do worse than our ancestors did. Think of where men's MMA was in the beginning and where it is now. Hell, think of where it was four years ago and where it is now. Do you guys really think women's MMA hasn't become more skilled and polished as a whole since Ronda fought Liz Carmouche? Women have had 100's of years to get better at tennis. How many years have they had to get better at MMA? In the same way that Babe Ruth would not be a dominate player if he played today, Ronda is not dominate today. The sport is quickly evolving, and it just so happen to pass her up. We will probably be saying the same thing about people like Amanda in a few years. We are talking about simple human progress here. It's not complex; It's not a leap; and it's not arguable. Saying the media shouldn't have hyped Ronda is like saying the media shouldn't have hyped Babe Ruth. It's an utter ignorance of context. The media latches onto whatever is hot. P.S. I still love me some Sassy Mousasi.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a Spur fan who has watched nearly all of their game this year, I would not be surprised if Danny Green shot really well tonight. I decided to use my golden pick 'em on him. Smart money is on Lou. Green has been off for nearly two years, though he has the potential to shoot really well at home, especially after shooting as poorly as he did last game. What I liked was how fearless he seemed to be shooting. He tends to shoot well angry. If you got the golden pick 'ems to spare, Green is probably the one to use it on out of all of the options today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love shooting on the wing and in the corner. For my shooting guard, I prefer that they be capable of a catch and shoot, because the initial inbound, quick pass to the wing and shot before the defense can set is easy money. It seems that Curry was best when you dribble and shoot, even better when you run the defense through screens. Curry missed a lot when I would shoot off the pass. Ultimately, I decided that he slowed my offense, missed open shots, and could be sold for a quick profit during the AS promo. I made KAT and got Gordon, who makes all the shots Curry missed--the quick release, no dribble shots. I still play both of those guys and feel that I've received more than enough value out of selling Curry. Curry might be right for some. Different strokes. </TEXT>

She would basically just walk into someone until she got a hold of them, which worked because of the competition she was facing. She wasn't eating too many stiff 1-2's when she walked into the clinch before Amanda and Holly. She was going to have to eat shots from Amanda to get in, and it would have been "her getting caught early" every time. I don't really see how it plays out any other way. The disparity between them is massive. It's not like she ate a lucky shot or just got caught.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None of those guys have the ability to finish near the basket with contact like he does. The variety of shots he has, many off the glass, is impressive. He's 6'1". All of those guys are taller and more athletic. That's not to say he's not athletic. It just seems like that guy has had to work a little bit harder than everyone else. IT, though smaller, has more physical attributes than Conley. I watched most of his games at OSU. To me, his ascendancy is more impressive than Kawhi's. I wouldn't have imagined that his ceiling was this high.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He has a tendency to do that. I'm more concerned about him getting lost on coverage. Dedmon makes up for a lot of things by being athletic and active. If he winds up blowing it on switches, leaving the Rockets with open threes, you'll see him about as much as we did this series.

I don't think foul problems were the major reason Dedmon was pulled. He was playing poorly. Marc got wide open threes and had his way with him. Dedmon was pretty much gone after a minute into the third quarter of game three (i think it was game three). Marc was pretty much limited from three after that. I think Dedmon needed to sit out. It was great to see him respond with intensity when he finally got some minutes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The guy dropped 51 with the Wizards. Hell, at 40 years of age, Mike got over 40, 4 steals, and 10 rebounds. No one does that. He's had more games like that with the Wizards than anyone over 37 has (8 over 40; next is Kareem with 4). You may say, "naw, don't give me Mike. I don't want to see old Mike. Old Mike will taint all the memories I had of young Bulls Mike." I say, *no. Give me old Mike. Hell, I'd say, give me 54 year old Mike for a few games right now!* You never say no to Mike. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read **Song of Solomon** for my Intro to Fiction class last semester. It's my favorite teachers favorite book, so I had high expectations. Early on, I was put off by Morrison's tendency to obfuscate the narrative. Suspense was on her mind at all times, and it seems to me that she went overboard. Small details would be given in what I call reverse order in the aim to build suspense. As the book progressed, it was no longer possible to hide smaller details, so we were left with the big reveal, and ultimately, Milkman's coming of age. That is where I really started loving **Song of Solomon**.  

It is a very complex story that is simply told. I consider that the mark of a masterpiece.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Game three was Danny's second best scoring output of the series. He had 6 points. Other than game two, he's yet to shoot over 33% and score more than 6 points. Charles' point is that he's giving the Spurs nothing offensively. He's kind of right.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's not wrong. I disagree with what he said about LA. Now, I've been one of the biggest critics of him. The fact is he played very well last game. He was everywhere. We are not getting 40 out of him, but he has clearly been the second best player on our team for most of this series. LA will score more in a Rockets series. He's doing what we need him to do.

	<TEXT> I am about half way through **Picture This**, By Joseph Heller. It is likely going to be my least favorite book by him. Dialogue is something that Heller excels at. Dialogue is absent from most of this book. It would have been better as a collection of essays.

Edit: I was wrong. I finished **Picture This** this morning. I found myself really sinking into it shortly after the halfway mark. 

It took longer than it had with the other novels of his that I've read, but as I began to see the pieces of the literary quilt come together, I became in awe of Heller's accomplishment. He takes disparate eras in history, the Dutch golden age, ancient Athens, a bit of modern America, comments on them through a painting by Rembrandt, *Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer*, and weaves them into a narrative that elucidates his own philosophy on politics and human nature. **Picture This** is a book that takes more than a few hours after finishing to fully appreciate. I'll be ruminating on it for a while. Let me make this clear: **Catch-22** is not Joseph Heller's only great novel. </TEXT>
