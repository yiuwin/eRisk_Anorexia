	<TEXT> Great explanation, and this is why a lot of people feel that software patents are ridiculous as a lot of them is just related to how to programmatically solve an idea. 

A great example is this https://www.wired.com/2012/07/apple-patent-gui-iphone/

As you said:

 A patentable invention is a device that solves a problem, that's never been invented before (patented, described, or build by anyone), that would not be obvious to someone skilled in the relevant field.

Whereas this Apple patent could be imagined by any person with a pencil and piece of paper (there is only so many ways to display messages on a small rectangular surface).   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Some Total War questions from a total noob. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-14 18:28:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all

TW:WH is my first TW game and only got it recently. Today is the first time I really were able to sit down and start playing the game.

I read some guides and looked at some YouTube guides but I am eager to get into the action, however I am getting my but kicked by the AI even in the very start.

I read some of the back lore of the various factions and would like to start as the Empire and then work my way through all of them.

Please can I get some help and feedback on the following questions:

1. How aggressive must I be on the world map? I can capture the first settlement Grunnberg I think it is called by the second turn. After I captured this town a new enemy shows up in the woods close to my capital city. I then rush there but have to end turn as I can't move all the way to the new enemy. With the begining of turn 3 I attack this enemy but just cannot win him, he is level 5 and has a buddy with him of also about level 5 plus he brings in reinforcements... Am I to eager to attack him or will he destroy my capital by turn 4-5 if I don't kill him right away?
2. Every single battle has to fought using correct formations and attack order right? This game is completely different (which I like, I just need to get better at it) compared to Dawn of War 1 / Starcraft where you micro manage units quickly but ussually just ctrl+1 then 'a' and click on what you want dead; repeat; Now this brings me to the actual question, from tutorials I read that the empire have gun using guys and bow / xbow using guys as ranged, but the gun guys can't shoot over another unit's head right? So the gun guys need to be in front of sword and shield guys and the archers behind sword and shield guys right? How do you keep the gun guys alive then though?
3. With regards to formations, I try and arrange my units as best as possible before the battle, but when the battle start and I have for instance my sword and shield guys in the front with archers in the back selected and right click on an enemy unit all goes to shit as my two units mix up and bump into each other and I am pretty sure a lot dies from friendly fire as well. How do I force them to stay in formation and attack and not to form just one big pile up?
4. Where can one download other player's replays? I would love to see how you pro guys go about winning with the Empire especially in the first couple of rounds?
5. Is Karl Franz a good Lord to use?
6. If I like to play defensive and turtle up, is the Empire a good choice?

Thanks to taking the time to reply. </TEXT>

I would take a constant 350 ms ping any day over jumping from 260 to 999+ every 30 seconds for a couple of seconds though...

Weird thing is that both WoW and SWTOR sits at 210 ms and very rarely goes above 250 ms. I also need to connect from South Africa to Europe for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But it seems to me that in Fantasy, Chaos are more a Viking / Norse type of barbarian people who never believed in any other Gods. They just always believed in their Chaos Gods.

Where as in 40k the Chaos marines seem to be space marines who all at one point believed well in the One Emperor God, but then somewhere along the way was turned from *normal* marines to Chaos marines.

Tl;dr Fantasy Chaos units can be born as little Chaos babies but 40k Chaos units are all (apart from the demons) converted over from another religion.

Edit: All my inferred info is from only playing DoW1 + DoW2 + TW:WH plus the Ultramarines movie, very hard to get actual GW stuff where I am at. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry friend, but I have no knowledge of VMWare unfortunately.

Fedora 25 works perfectly in Virtualbox 4.1.8 though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before the VM starts go to settings and untick '3D acceleration'.  It will work with Wayland and Xorg then without any issues. I also experience no lag or video stuttering doing normal coding stuff in Fedora 25 without 3D GPU acceleration. Games may be another issue though but that is why I have the PS4. Use the best tool for the job  </TEXT>

So is it possible to see exactly which quests you did or still need to do? Especially ones that will give a permanent boost to your character like a skill point for instance?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A computer will be better at finding a counter example to some conjecture that will disprove the conjecture. Although some conjectures in the past were disproved by values so large that a computer would never be able to calculate up to there.

To really solve most conjectures requires a lot more creativity (at which computers are currently bad at) compared to computation speed (which computers are really good at). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The conjecture has not yet been proven, but it is considered to be true because it has been tested for all integer values up to 52^60.

Do you have proof of this? The largest number that can be stored in one Terabyte of storage is 1x10^12

And that is just storing the number, let alone doing any computation with it.

Isn't 5x2^60 some mathematical proof lower / upper bound? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing with time travel (in the sense of an actual person travelling back in time) is that if it is / was / would become possible, we in all likely hood would have experienced some of its symptoms by now.

The amount of energy and money needed to make this profitable rules out the idea of a lone crazy scientist building a time machine into his car.

It would be huge corporations doing this, and to make it profitable they would definitely influence history to favor them.

We just don't see any evidence that this ever happened.

Time travel and UFOs both fit squarely in the realm of science fiction for me. </TEXT>
