	<TEXT> Yeah and they do cardio at the gym too so 3x gym a day :P But yeah, the amount wasn't really the main point here as much as why they're able to work SO much more than a regular guy. Got it answered pretty much though! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yeah, so basically what I'm asking for is that the program is ppl and tells me to start by doing push, pull, rest, legs, rest. Could I do push pull legs push pull legs rest instead? I've been doing that for a while but I haven't followed any program so I was wondering if that's wrong. Sundays have always been a rest day for me and that just doesn't really fit into my schedule, so do I have to remake my schedule or..?

	<TEXT> I'm using 64 bit windows 8.1.
First of all I want to say that I've spent approx 5 hours trying out different answers from google, and they have not worked. This post might also be a long one since there's a bit back story included(not yet, if needed I'll add), but if you think it might not be necessary feel free to skip it. Thanks in advance.
Okay so I'm trying to download drivers to my wacom intuos pen-tablet. I have no problem downloading it, but when I try to run it it all goes well except that 2 times during the installation after running the exe file that's meant to install the drivers I get the 0xc000007b error, so basically ''program was unable to run properly''. I've never had this problem before, I've been using this tablet and the drivers for almost a year now and everything has worked, but now after having to factory reset my pc (This is where the backstory jumps in, if the reason matters I can tell it but it's a bit complicated) and trying to reinstall it something just goes wrong. I've tried every possible solution I've found, most of which just tell me to download a file that redownloads and installs windows programs and drivers in case some of them isn't working. The videos or forums that have had this linked have also had huge amount of ''thanks it helped'' comments, so I'd guess this is what works for most people. Not for me though. uninstalling the program and deleting every file about it that it had in the folder, I also searched up for more and found two more .exe files that were also part of it but didn't get removed during the uninstall.
tl;dr Wacom intuos driver installation doesn't work. Gives a common error (0xc000007b) but none of the solutions I've found during 4-5 hours have worked. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-03-19 16:59:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yeah so I was in a game playing cs, the game froze and I had to press the power button that turns off everything and asks that ''these are running do you want to force shutdown or cancel'' I hit cancel and once I opened steam and everything required to play I had approx 50 more fps. This got me thinking that is there any easy way of shutting down useless programs/knowing which ones are useless? Task manager doesn't help since there's a shitload of stuff and I don't know what even 10% of them are. Tried googling this aswel but found no real answers, only applications that do that for you and some weird answers regarding task manager.

Thanks and if any of you need more info to answer please let me know, I only get approx 80 fps and going from 60-80 to 130-150 is a HUGE difference.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea I remember these 2 higher ranked players and mvps, and I think atm I could hold my own against eagle ranked players, anything above is pretty much out of my league for now. The problem is that a lot of my friends have also quit cs and the ones that aren't are either global/supreme or there's not enough of us to make a 5 man.

And some other players aren't too fond with the idea of having a mg1 player in their games, no matter if I say I'm good or not :P. Which is ofc understandable. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-19 13:59:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yeah so a little backstory first. I used to be supreme/global back in the day (like 2 years ago) and quit the game due to various reasons. Kept playing one game every now and then and got placed to lower and lower rank, until finally starting the game again after getting placed to gn2 (wasn't waiting until that happened just got motivation to play again)

Now that the prime matchmaking exists and I've gotten some of my aim back it's fairly easy to win games for me, and I've ranked up to mg1 in few days, my question is, how many games does it usually take to rank up? At the moment I'm on a ~25 win streak and that has only gotten me 2 ranks from gn3 (lost a few and won a few before getting to gn3 while getting my aim and skills back), while playing against higher ranks than me? I'm also top fragging in every game (probably have been 3rd or 2nd like 3 times out of those ~25 games).

I remember that it used to take me like 5 wins in a row to rank up when I was gold nova or mg1 for the first time, not 13 or so? Took me 15 to get to lem for the first time, what's up with this? Is it normal nowadays or is there something I'm not aware of? 

Thanks for any responses. Greatly appreciated. 

Ps. Also I feel the need to say, that I'm not really complaining, just wondering because from what I remember this isn't normal. 

Edit: I also play solo only pretty much if that matters, and the few friends I've played with have all been higher ranks than me but still I've done better so I haven't been carried or anything like that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it's kinda strange how because of cycling and learning to walk differently (don't ask it's apprently super rare lol) my lower body has always been the ''strong'' part of my body. Now I'm just scared that if I don't work it as hard as I could I'll end up having a physique that's not really good for me. So lower body is really important all together to me, so I'll definitely do these. Great if they improve the same areas as squats too </TEXT>

I did find the Fallout4prefs.ini file that's also needed, but there's no fallout4.ini. There's fallout4_default.ini however, which looks pretty much what I'd assume the other one would look like (looks similiar to other .ini files i've seen), there's even the [archive] part where I'm meant to add stuff.

So yeah, any idea what's going?
