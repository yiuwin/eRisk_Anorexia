	<TEXT> At worst this is going to be an amazing learning experience for a bunch of rookies, who are going to get to play playoffs hockey against arguably the best team in the NHL. 

There's also no pressure for the Leafs. If we get swept, our collective expectations will be properly managed... this is still a rebuild! If we win even a single game, that shows tremendous growth and promise for a team that came dead last last year and is stacked with record numbers of promising rookies. </TEXT>
