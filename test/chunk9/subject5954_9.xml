	<TEXT> Brutus - Postpunk/Shoegaze band from Leuven, Belgium.

Brutus is a power trio forged in Leuven (BE) early 2014. Brutus sparked, ignited and took off instantaneous. The sparks channeled into highly energetic, but always catchy tunes. From dissonant noise rock, to brutal metal structures to almost fragile guitar sounds, Brutus covers and masters a vast array of different styles. All these influences are seamlessly blended into their own distinct sound: freaky guitar tones and pounding bass lines that are kept in check by the tightest singing female drummer we have ever encountered.
