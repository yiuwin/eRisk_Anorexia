	<TEXT>  TBH, I wouldn't even consider an adjunct as an Academic. 

Well, I produce research, publish articles, receive grants, present papers at conferences, participate in ongoing international projects, design courses, teach those courses, sit on departmental committees, conduct public outreach on the department's behalf, etc. etc. If I'm not an academic, I'm doing a damned good job at faking it. It's certainly true that I do all this while lacking the security that a full-time position provides, but I am also taking active steps to change that. In the meantime, I do the work because I enjoy it and believe in its value.

 It's essentially just a teaching gig with no real control over curriculum development.

This is not even remotely true for the position I hold, but alright.

 Also, in the humanities, that must be a real ballbreaker as one can't generate new knowledge that can be applied in other disciplines (engineering/sciences).

This isn't really the case either, though I'll admit that it's much different from what one might find in STEM disciplines or even the social sciences. Much of my work has interdisciplinary relevance for history and conflict studies, for example, and I've presented at as many history conferences as literary ones. I won't pretend that I'm reinventing the wheel, here, but there have been many opportunities for work of this sort.

Anyway, I think I responded to the OP in an unnecessarily heated way, and I'm sorry for that. Still, much of the venom on display is coming from seeing someone who has a) focused entirely on the personal emolument that the position could bring rather than upon his responsibilities and duties, and b) denounced everyone here for their dedication because he makes more money and hates liberalism(?!). This is all assuming that what he says is true, though, which I don't. I'm not sure which would be worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Neither of these things is the case, thankfully! I'm just keenly aware that new tools and platforms are being developed all the time, and that I may not hear about them very quickly because I don't always have time to talk to the people who discover and use them. Incidentally, my school does indeed make the results of our formal evaluations available to the students, but the process involved in accessing them is somewhat byzantine and many students have expressed surprise that they're allowed to see them at all.

Anyway, I'm not a fan of RMP at all for many of the reasons already outlined in this thread, but as long as it is exists it's perhaps worth keeping an eye on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No actual answers, eh. #Shocker

As for myself, I have no patience for hateful frauds -- especially when they're apparently upset over things like "safe spaces" or whatever other thing about which you're wringing your hands. Unlike you, I have spent many actual years teaching thousands of actual students, and I understand all too well the need for nuance and patience when trying to create classroom environments for people from wildly different backgrounds.

You're asking me for "introspection" when I have literally spent the last ten years interrogating and refining my own practices so that I can be more open and friendly and accommodating to students who are facing challenges that I am not. I care about them -- it's my job to do so, and also my responsibility as a human being. You have rejected both of these things, which I suppose is your right, but don't blame the rest of us for viewing you as a garbage coward for doing so.

I'm upset about your life choices because everything you've said about yourself suggests that the time you claim to have spent as an academic probably saw you *hurt people* in service of some fetishization of your own superiority. Literally nothing you've said indicates that you knew anything about your students, or about the complexities of teaching, or that you put your own ridiculous ego aside to help them. You are the absolute antithesis of a teacher. You actually make people more stupid when they listen to you.

I close by reiterating the questions you, like a coward, failed to answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point of these questions is giving the people in this sub a better sense of who you are, given that you're just turning up and making provocative claims. I'm sorry that this seems unjust or weird to you.

 I'm not sure how to answer your second question--I applied, got interviewed, got the job.

Yes, of course -- obviously this could never have involved any details worth passing along! The whole thing probably just took mere minutes, and nobody involved discussed any specifics. No application package, no campus visit, nothing. I'm sure they just hired you because they were dazzled by your magnificence.

 I researched a highly specialized topic in the soft social sciences.

"What topic did you research?"

"I researched a topic."

*Jesus*

 2:2 load at an R1. 1 grad level per year, the rest undergrad.

I'm sure you could go into all sorts of detail about this. Yes?

 Job talk was on my research and pub history, future pub plans.

"My job talk was about the things they ask about in job talks."

*HOLY SHIT*

 Teaching theory is bullshit. 

Which teaching theory is bullshit? What theorists' ideas have you specifically rejected? What are you objections? What are your arguments against it?

 Go up and talk about what you know, good students will listen. Bad students can fuck off.

MFW when a failed tenure-track prof talks so cavalierly about "bad students."

 Weighted averages for all exams.

My god, stop choking us with so much detail and specificity! We can't handle it!

 My student evaluations were quite high--forget the average but 4.x on a 5 scale.

You're lying, and the burden is on you to prove otherwise.

 I'm not sure what the point of these questions are 

The point is to expose you as the hateful fraud that you are. Even if you *were* an actual professor, I think it's pretty probable that you were an embarrassment. You certainly are now, and you aren't even in the profession.

 (I find it amusing that people thing a TT professorship is so prestigious these days that it warrants impersonation)

It's not -- but here you are, impersonating. You chose to post this thread.

 but I'm sure you'll just respond with "lol lying idiot". Fine by me; I know the truth.

You trashy coward. YOU were the one who came here, by your own choice, to make stupid provocative claims. I'm so sorry that other people have offended you by asking you questions about your stupid failed career as a person responsible for teaching things to people eager to learn. </TEXT>

That's fair -- nobody wants you to compromise your identity here. Still: 

- How long did your PhD take?
- What can you tell us about how you became a tenure-track professor? 
- What did you research? 
- What was your teaching experience and load? 
- How did your interview go, and what was your job talk about? 
- What are your thoughts on the major questions in teaching theory?
- If that last one was too hard, what was your grading approach to the classes you had to teach?
- What numerical student evaluations can you share with us, and in what category?

These are really, *really* basic questions. Please answer. </TEXT>

By the time the novel was actually published, what sort of situation might Chris have found if he returned to the Western Front after the book's final pages?

	<TEXT> I'm sorry for the hyperbolic aside in the title, but this is something pretty special. Saki has long been a favourite of mine for his wonderfully savage assaults on the respectable Edwardian upper classes, but "The Unrest-Cure" is a cut above the rest and somewhat historically ominous. It's very short, anyway, and I hope those who check it out enjoy it.

For reference, the story comes from *The Chronicles of Clovis* (1911), one of Saki's collections of short fiction. The titular character appears throughout the story without any effort at introduction, but you need know nothing about him beyond the fact that he is a trickster who would have made Loki blush.

Saki himself would be killed by a sniper's bullet at Beaumont-Hamel in November of 1916. </TEXT>

True enough, but if you ask the man in the street if he's heard of Rebecca West he'll say "what the hell are you talking about?" If you ask some basically well-read people about her, you might get recollections of *Return of the Soldier* or maybe even *Black Lamb and Grey Falcon*. That she spent her extreme early career contributing to *Blast!* and *The Exile*, of all things, is comparatively far less known, at least in my experience.

 She's great. Don't sleep on dat West and Return of the Soldier.

Agreed. I'm also hugely partial to her early essays.

Part of what inspired me to post this is that I took my undergrads through our first session on *Return of the Soldier* today, and it put me in a mood to go down this rabbit hole again. I'd really like to know what she thought (if anything) of the 1982 film adaptation of the thing, given that she did actually survive long enough to offer opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depending on the process by which your future department awards TA contracts, it very well could be significant on an employment level, but I concur with others who have emphasized that research output -- especially if you have publications or even research funding coming into your degree -- are going to be the most important thing by far.

That being said, once you've actually *finished* the PhD, having a long history of teaching success and useful material to include in your teaching portfolio can indeed be very, very important. Not every school offers the kind of teaching experience for grad students that one once might have expected, so -- especially if this is the case at whichever school you end up at -- it could be a good idea to keep this sort of thing up. On an even more basic level, once you have the degree in hand and a good research profile, you *will* need things on your CV to differentiate you from all the other applicants who have the same thing. A legacy of teaching success is not to be disdained.

**TL;DR:** Little importance to your PhD application, potentially of some importance for your PhD life, very much worth maintaining for your post-PhD career. Don't let it get in the way of your research, because that really is the most important thing at your current stage, but keep it up if you can.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that's a good standard approach, but it will also depend on just what you intend to *do* while you're there. Do you have appointments set up to meet with anyone (such as a potential supervisor) one-on-one? Will you be meeting prospective peers as well? Or will the weekend consist mostly of campus tours and impersonal presentations?

If you are going to be sitting down with persons of importance, it might be worth dressing a bit more formally. Still, there's no accounting for campus or departmental culture, and this can be hard to determine without having actually visited first. Many of my colleagues are quite comfortable meeting with people in sweats and jeans.

A final consideration will be just how long you have to be out and about. Certainly don't wear anything that you'd be uncomfortable being in all day, if that's how long it's going to take. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The last time I got some keys cut, it astounded me how quickly the machine attendant was able to do it. It made me think about locks and keys in my own period of study, and I'm curious to know if anything like a modern cutting machine existed then. Were there different processes for pin vs. lever locks? Could an effective copy be made from a clay impression, or would the machinist have needed the real thing?

I usually just research questions from my own period myself, but this is an aspect of material history that I'm finding to be something of a tough nut to crack. Any advice or leads would be appreciated. </TEXT>

Even knowing he exists puts you in a fairly elite class. Which of his works do you like the most? A *Clayhanger* fan, or something else? Most of my interest in him is predicated upon his involvement in the British home-front propaganda scene during the First World War, but his novels about that subject (*The Pretty Lady* and *Lord Raingo*) are terrific. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should have Lord of Emperors on standby, yes. This is not to say that Sarantium isn't a reasonably complete story in itself -- it's a satisfying narrative that comes to a conclusion, albeit a bit mysteriously at points. Still, Emperors picks up shortly after it leaves off, and resolves a number of things that are sort of left hanging at Sarantium's end. Emperors is also *fantastic*, and spends a lot of time with a really interesting character who is referenced passingly in a number of GGK's other books set in the same world.

I still have to read Lions! I'm glad that I've still got more of his books left to experience for the first time than not, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I never meant to be so mysterious about it!

Basically I'm working on an article about toast particularly and bread generally in twentieth-century British literature -- the kind of achingly specific article that only an internally dead academic could write. Food in literature has always fascinated me, given that almost none of the senses involved in it can translate well into text, but people can still find themselves salivating at descriptions all the same.

That, on a secondary level, is a big part of it. Beyond the academic interest, I just... really like toast. A nice, big, thick piece of egg bread or rye bread toasted with a melting knob of butter is my idea of heaven -- and reading descriptions of people eating such a thing just makes me feel happy. </TEXT>

That world is so big and travel so difficult, though, that there's never any real overlap between the stories themselves -- just a shared and enormous setting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **A Narrative**

We were strong in those days -- and we ate. Oh my, yes, we ate. We were avowed trenchermen; we were gourmands. Why, we thought that we could eat forever, then, and never tire. 

We ate of only the *best* that the Earth and her bounty had to offer, too: Wonder Bread, Cheeze Whiz, Miracle Whip, and Bologna. We knew these victuals well: they were our soul. We ate, I say to you again -- and if any stopped to ask us why, we would only laugh and eat all the more.

We loved eating. It was the joy of our days.

One day, when still we were young and strong, we were confronted with a new kind of food. They called it "Shakshuka," and it regarded us grimly from the plate. There was no explaining a dish like that. There were eggs in it, but they hadn't been soft-boiled! Where was the toast cut into strips so that we could dip into the yolk? Were we expected to eat the egg whites too? Where was the ketchup? We were told that there were plenty of tomatoes in it, but they were not sweet as those we had come to love. There were also, if you will credit it, *peppers*. And we were bidden to eat them too. How could we, though? None of it was relevant to our modern tastes.

"Mom," one of us asked; "why can't we just have a handful of gummy bears dissolved in a bowl of Mountain Dew like we did yesterday?"

"That's not very good for you," she said, dismissing all alternate opinions and insisting on her own interpretation. "Besides, just give it a try -- you might like it."

Our father made the matter worse by telling us the history of the dish, explaining how the different ingredients worked together, and describing some notable variants in preparation. He forced *his* interpretation on us as well, demanding we accept mere pedantic details as being important, and seemed not even to care about the most important thing of all: surely the chef just made it because it was supposed to be food, and would have been outraged at this overanalysis. Don't try to convince me that he chose fresh tomatoes over canned *on purpose*. A tomato is a tomato. And let us dispense at once with this notion that he chose specific amounts and kinds of paprika and cumin to add to the mixture: obviously he just put them in because they were spices, and that's that. I feel nauseous thinking about it even now.

A small thing, you might say -- but you would be wrong. From that moment onward we lost our love of eating forever, my friends and I. Nothing tasted good to us ever again, and it's probably been years now since I ate anything at all. One of my former comrades claims to have taken up eating again after trying something called a Cronut, but I've never heard of it. Still, if it resembles the rich and satisfying foods of our youth... if... *if...*

For now, though, a manifesto of sorts. If children must be given food, give them only the food that they like and which is relatable to them. Food does not need to be planned, or to include ingredients; indeed, talking about these matters ruins food entirely. All we should take into account is that the chef wanted to make food, and only if he said so; everything else is folly. 

**TL;DR:** These kids are going to be the death of me </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a fun anecdote about a WWI signaller from the memoirs of Anthony French of the 15th London, if you're interested:

 One spark of humour could set a whole column alight.

 We approached a signaller industriously repairing a broken line and a voice cried: "Some say 'Good old Signals!'" to which a second voice replied: "Others say '... old Signals!'"  The verb was irrelevant and its execution biologically absurd, but the couplet was invariable whoever might be the "good old this" or "good old that."  It was always the curious colloquial adjective "old" that preserved the affection.

 The signaller took no heed.

 "He's going up the 'line,'" someone suggested.

 "Lend 'im your button 'ook," said another.

 The signaller turned and shouted with feigned surprise,

 "Oh!  It's the bloody infantry.  What *you* doing up the line, anyway?"

 "We're looking for the GPO."

 "Lookin' for bloody trouble, you mean," said the signaller, raising a fist.

 Another voice shouted: "What did you do in the Great War, Daddy?" and from somewhere came the oft-repeated quip: "Hold your tongue, son, and polish up those medals!"...

 "Medals?" cried another; "I've spat 'em before breakfast!"

 Someone tried to sing "Give me the switch Miss for Ipswich, it's the Ipswich switch which I require," but meter and pace failed to register, so Maxwell raised his voice and set the column singing:

    *"Kitty, Kitty, isn't it a pity in the City you work so hard*

    *With your 'One, two, three four five six seven eight Gerrard?'*

    *Kitty, Kitty, isn't it a pity that you're wasting so much time*

    *With your lips close to the telephone when they might be close to mine?"*

 My last sight of the field-telephone man was of his face wreathed in smiles and his hand waving a friendly farewell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a notably better approach than relying on Google News Alerts (which can still be quite helpful, sometimes), given that there's no consistent controlling for context with them. I want to keep up to date on developments in literary modernism, for example -- new exhibits, collections, popular articles, libraries, etc. What I **get** is endless press releases about the sale of modernist furniture.

I want to keep up with every mention of Sir Douglas Haig in the news. What I **get** is every mention of some baffling (potentially Spanish?) soccer team that bears his name.

Anyway, Google Scholar is much better for at least having a more academically relevant pool of sources. Caff is right on the money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So late to this thread, but I don't care:

During the course of the First World War, the English Lt. Col. Percy Fawcett was given command of an artillery battery that had been achieving great success. They had been doing as much because of their previous commander's willingness to use novel and unorthodox methods for finding corresponding artillery targets -- the flashes of battery fire against cloud cover, the angular calculation of echoes, the reverberation of such fire through the earth, etc. All of this may sound very unusual indeed, but it was quite sound and quite successful during the war.

Lt. Col. Fawcett, however, would have *none of it*. In his ironclad, brute-facts wisdom, he told his newly-acquired battery that they were to stop these ridiculous modern affectations at once. Instead -- and here we descend into hell itself -- his batteries were only to fire on targets they could literally see with their eyes or which had been *vouchsafed to them by Lt. Col. Fawcett's OUIJA board.* This did not work very well at all, as you may imagine.

In 1925, Fawcett would disappear -- presumed dead -- while searching for the "Lost City of Z" in Brazil. No trace of him was ever found. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I also finished Hew Strachan's *The First World War* yesterday. I've heard it's the go-to overview of the war but I thought that he got lost in the weeds to much with military maneuvers which I couldn't follow due to the lack of maps. There were also a few cases where he assumed the reader had a basic level of knowledge about the war that I didn't have; I don't know if that reflects poorly on me or Strachan. Overall, it was decidedly average. 

I'm sorry to hear that! Was this the single-volume 2004 version? Or was it *The First World War Vol I: To Arms* (2001)? The single-volume version was released as a tie-in with a documentary series he oversaw, if I remember correctly, and your criticisms of it have certainly been echoed elsewhere. The *To Arms* volume is another matter entirely, though: thrice the length, ten times the detail -- and still maddeningly incomplete. He was on contract with Oxford to produce two subsequent volumes, but most of us have pretty much given up on that, at this point.

 If any one has any suggestions for other good overviews, preferably with a greater focus on politics and diplomacy, I'd love to hear some recommendations.

As to that, you'd likely have a better experience with David Stevenson's *Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy* (2004; recently re-released as a Penguin paperback under the title *1914-1918: The History of the First World War*). It is broad in scope but pleasingly focused in its approach, if that distinction makes any sense. It's very good at what it does. </TEXT>

In the meantime, when it comes to recommendations, [David Stevenson's *Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy*](https://books.google.ca/books?id=DSc9CraE4OQC) (2004) has been my go-to single-volume work on the subject for quite a while. Don't let the title fool you, though -- it has much to say about the war's military dimensions as well, and takes up this task splendidly. The book recently received a Penguin re-release as *1914-1918: The History of the First World War* -- this affordable paperback is likely to be the most accessible for anyone seeking out Stevenson's work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, now it just seems like a dismaying coincidence -- Shaw's popularity in the 1880s was mostly limited to his work as a journalist and critic in the UK, and I can conceive of no reason why someone in Quebec would have admired him sufficiently three years before his first widely successful play to name a child after him. Still, he had published quite a lot even then, and an English-speaking Canadian who was active in Socialist or otherwise reformist circles would stand a good chance of having been exposed to his work, at least.

As to the question of mutual acquaintance, the answer is "almost certainly not," punctuated by a kind of sad shrug. I can find no useful biographical information about Ingham, so I've no idea what his politics were (though I suppose we may start to develop a picture based on his published poetical works, which mostly seem to be somewhat conservative, religious and history-oriented), but it's very unlikely that Page and Shaw would have seen anything in each other to admire. 

Shaw was... well, Shaw. Page was a vigorously pro-Southern conservative who literally wrote in defense of lynching as a necessary practice to keep "the Negro" in his place, and who despised all attempts at social reform as a departure from the courtly Southern values that had once made at least half of the country great. Whether it could be made great again with a more amenable president is difficult to say, but it remains the case that he was the recipient of inordinate and somewhat baffling honours under the Wilson administration -- appointed ambassador to Rome, as I mentioned, in spite of having no government experience and speaking no Italian.

The mystery is tugging at me as well, and I regret that I've probably just ended up adding confusion rather than insight to this. I really want to know what his deal was! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As the title suggests, some students have used period-appropriate materials to recreate a section of the Western Front in an enormous dumpster. Both the interior and exterior are used to great effect -- the former for the trench itself, the latter for information cards explaining various features of it and the history involved.

This is a marvelous use of cheap materials to create an interactive and informative exhibit. If it were more easily portable it would be even better, I suppose, but it's a very neat idea as it stands. I'm hoping that the coming centenary in the United States will occasion more little projects like this. </TEXT>

Incidentally, I can't help but feel how weird this practice would be if it were carried out today -- naming my son "Jonathan Franzen Milne" or something like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm powerless to really help you, given that I'm on the road, but count me in for being curious about this highly unusual set of circumstances.

I'm sure you've looked into this already, but there was a wildly popular American novelist and diplomat named Thomas Nelson Page who was active at this time -- the American ambassador to Rome from 1913 through 1919, in fact. His novels keep coming up in discussions I've read of the reading tastes of American soldiers and civilians during the war, though, and he was terribly prolific. 

Of course, none of this would explain why a man of the 25th Canadian Infantry Battalion would have briefly taken the name of an author whose work focused more or less solely on the Southern "Lost Cause" mythos and the alleged perfidy of African Americans, so there's probably no connection at all. Still, if I encountered a soldier who briefly declared his name was "Conan Doyle" or something of the like, I'd at least have to wonder! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I understand it, every execution order had to be approved by the C-in-C. He did indeed have over 3000 of them cross his desk, during his tenure from 1915 through 1918, and he recommended that 2700 of them be commuted to imprisonment or some other punishment.

As sad as the practice was, it is worth remembering that not every such execution was just for "cowardice" -- blandly described and with no other qualifier attached. Many of those so sentenced were repeat offenders who had already been given a chance to reform, and some would have received stiff (and even fatal) sentences even in peacetime. Still, there have rightly been some very prominent post-facto investigations into circumstances now that things are not so urgent, and the movement that has called for (and achieved) posthumous pardons is to be credited for its humanitarian instinct.

In sum, while I do not believe that those calling this a unilateral monstrosity are completely correct, I am deeply sympathetic to their attempts to be sympathetic in turn to those who faced and endured the ultimate punishment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome, Dr. Truitt! This is a fascinating subject.

1. Does your research extend to less corporeal "machines" like the Arabic *zairja* or the *Ars Magna* of Ramon Lull? I've heard it said that these are sometimes viewed as early attempts (however abstract) at creating a sort of "programming language," and it intrigues me (if so) to see them cropping up around the time that the pieces of hardware you mention were being developed.

2. Do you have a personal favourite medieval automaton? Which and why, if so?

3. Much more frivolous, but: what do you think of Festo's ongoing work on authentically-motioned animal robots? [Their SmartBird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnR8fDW3Ilo) is a thing of beauty, to give but one example. </TEXT>
