	<TEXT> When you say as a group, do you mean her boyfriend should be included?

I'm by no means interested in the girl in question. We're strictly friends, good ones at that. There have been times where we start off a night as a big group, head out to a bar, her boyfriend (and a few others) leaves early but she stays and still has a good time. Would it still be weird if I set up the plans with her? How about her and another friend or two?

Thank you!

Edit: words </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a few possibilities I can think of from what I have garnered from your situation.

His parents might still be put off by you. That would be true with a lot of parents. They might *say* they're OK with you, but still bad mouth you when you're not around. It's normal.

Don't take your friend's word for it if he says you're not too clingy. I would never tell my friend he's clingy. Even though I think that 100%, I wouldn't want any hard feelings between us.

If you really think you have nothing to lose, you can just come straight out with it and ask why he never takes the initiative to hang with you. </TEXT>

I feel like a horrible person for it, but I'm on the other end of the situation. I've been friends with this guy for 7 years. The first 4 were amazing. Then (until now), it's always him who tries to set up plans.

Are you too clingy? When you talk to him, do you keep the conversation interesting? Are you a "buzzkill" sometimes? Those 3 are things my friend does on a regular basis. It makes me feel like shit when I turn him down. </TEXT>
