	<TEXT> We already got that political stuff in BvS and I don't want to go down that road of who the JL has to answer to. Civil War also did that and it would be redundant. 

They decided to make a "realistic" comic book universe - which means you can't really avoid the political ramifications of a group of superheroes saving the world from an invasion and how countries would react. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't even have to flesh out the characters. You can't do that in a 2 and a half hour film that has an invasion plot. Just work on bringing the team together, give them chemistry, moments of levity, and have a plot that makes sense. He does that, and the movie will be liked by general audiences

Yep, JL doesn't have to be an Oscar worthy movie - just a really fun blockbuster movie that doesn't insult the general audience's intelligence.

Good script, good action, good editing and good direction = Great movie.

While the DCEU doesn't have the luxury of solo movies for all it's characters - it can still be amazing if they just focus on each part meticulously.

JL will be the turning point, either it helps the DCEU or it destroys their credibility. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uh, Bay is doing something right. The way he shoots action is so iconic they made a name for it. Just because you don't like him doesn't mean he doesn't do anything well

Bay is an extremely competent filmmaker, but the Transformers franchise is utter shit. "The way he shoots" doesn't negate the quality of the end product.


I used Bay as an example to illustrate that while Sandler is a beloved comic.....he has become the ambassador of shitty comedies.

Netflix deciding to host him on their platform has nothing to do with the quality of his movies or him "doing something right", and all to do with his notoriety/B.O draw.....like Bay.

Sandler's brand of comedy has expired, and so has this meme.

Unlike other memes like "For You", "Oscar Winner" and "Zack Attack" which are innocent fun - "Muh Superman" mocks fans of the DCEU who didn't particularly like the way Superman was portrayed in BvS.

I've laughed for a long time, but I feel like this meme encapsulates the way the sub treats criticism.

You can't discuss Superman's character without somebody parroting "Muh Superman" in the comments....and it's become tiring - especially when you're discussing the movie seriously.

	<TEXT> You got the appropriate evolution. You just didn't like it.

It wasn't the appropriate evolution.

MoS ended after the BZ event, a time when the panic and fear would be at an all time high. Even at an extremely stressful time, Clark was happy.

Not only was he happy, he was confident enough to destroy the US military's drone.

THAT is Superman.

In BvS, Superman regresses - constantly doubting himself and shutting everyone out.

No one smiles when they're saving other people's lives. Not firefighters, policemen or even Good Samaritans.

Firefighters, Policemen and good samaritans all talk to the people they're saving.

They talk with them, comfort them....and smiling is an extension of that.

I seriously don't get why you can't see that smiling doesn't always denote happiness, it just shows that the person is willing to comfort somebody else in their time of need.

I was in a crash, people helped me out of the car and constantly talked with me and helped alleviate the pain I was feeling - the paramedics also did the same when they arrived.

Imagine if they hadn't said a word? They just pull me out of the car and left....

They're actually focused on doing the saving, not being a hero. 

They've already saved the person, they are no longer in danger.

 He's not going to be in a jovial mood when people are dying left and right around him. That's not Superman.

People are dying always, do you want Superman to constantly be a sad sack?

I seriously don't get your hatred for a Superman that communicates with people.

He doesn't even have to smile, [just showing concern is enough](https://youtu.be/87ZTS7Fdg90?t=119).

EDIT: [Here is a video illustrating what I'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MTXjsJXUL8). There are thousands of videos like this on the internet, showing police and firefighters talking with the victims and comforting them....even in a situation as absurd as choking on a hotdog. </TEXT>

Are you calling me simple minded?

Is it a crime to want a Superman who enjoys his work?

The "Day of the Dead" scene was going in the right direction, but it portrays his heroism in such a morose tone.

I didn't want a "jolly go lucky" Superman, just the appropriate evolution from MoS......a man who is haunted by the BZ event but enjoys his life and loves interacting with people.

	<TEXT> Yes, it will change the discussion.

If WW does horribly, **a lot** of people will give up on the DCEU. 

If WW is a critical success, people will congratulate Patty Jenkins and discussions regarding the DCEU will slightly change. 

 

If JL is a critical success, the DCEU can consider themselves absolved of all their wrong doings....this is the point where the dialogue truly shifts.

However, if JL is indeed a great movie - everybody but Snyder will be thanked.

Most people would attribute the success of JL to the new management and Geoff Johns holding the reigns.

Why?

Critics didn't like MoS, BvS (and the majority of his movies), if JL is successful - they will attribute the success to the outlier.

	<TEXT> While it would be interesting, wouldn't the existence of Doomsday essentially spell the termination of life on Krypton?

Not only can he not be killed, but the kryptonians don't have the same power/abilities as Superman.

I think they should focus on political intrigue and interesting villains like the precursor of Brainiac.

Allusions to Darkseid would be awesome as well.

That's like saying, "Michael Bay must be doing something right as the director of Transformers - since his movies make bank".

The reality of the matter is, Netflix's decision was purely business driven - using his name and notoriety to get people to watch the abominations he created (The Ridiculous 6, The Do Over, The Cobbler).

The Room is loved universally and celebrated, but you won't hear anybody saying it's a good movie.

So....I don't understand where this convo is going. </TEXT>

This was more a joke on the Himedere trope who usually get away with anything since their dad is the headmaster or is super high up.

Don't worry, I got the joke :)

I think Prison School subverted that trope well.

	<TEXT> So what was the best outcome here then? Try to buy someone else's ticket? Obviously it was a mistake to overboard the flight but then what was the right way to correct it?

They could have;

- Increased the compensation and make sure it's in cash, instead of United credit.

- Flown their employees on a different flight.

- Rented a car/bus and drive their employees (Chicago to Louisville is a 5 hour trip).

One thing I do have to clarify, is that the plane **was not overbooked**.

Issues with overbooking are usually resolved just before entering the plane.

The flight was full, there was no overbooking and therefore...United had no right to do what they did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My initial understanding was that they were getting people onto the plane who were part of the flight crew; not employees flying as passengers.

The employees they wanted to move weren't actually part of **this** flight's crew....but for another flight after they reach Louisville.

Can you point me to anything about this bit specifically because it's the one thing I've been having trouble establishing.

[Here is an article discussing this](
https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinenegroni/2017/04/12/united-flight-not-overbooked-airline-admits/#b9795062f18d)

Normally, an airline overbooks to ensure all of it's seats are filled.

However, the United flight was appropriately filled and there were no issues...until they decided to put their employees on board (a very very late decision if I might add).

Is there anything establishing whether these were people who were required to be on the flight or simply people United wanted on the flight with precedence over this guy?

- United decided to add their own employees on board (who are not apart of *this* crew but were scheduled to fly after reaching Louisville).

- They tried to buy the seats by compensating the passengers with United credit/points.

- Random passengers were told to voluntarily leave the flight.

- David Dao was one of these "randomly chosen passengers".

- He refused - problem starts.

	<TEXT> I think there were multiple reasons;

1 - His work as a doctor involved a time sensitive task that he couldn't delay.

2 - It wasn't actually overbooking, United just decided to throw people out because they wanted to get their own crew on the flight. There were many ways to get their crew to their destination (Bus or a flight on a different airline).

3 - The were not giving money as compensation but United credit....which is useless when you don't fly often. What are you going to do with 700 United dollars/points?

	<TEXT> I think Anime is at an impasse.

The Japanese movie adaptions of anime/manga lack the funding to create a satisfying enough movie for western fans and the Hollywood adaptions end up disappointing as well (most veering away from the original story's premise anyway).

I think TV adaptions might be the way of the future.

Think of a Netflix show like Marco Polo or SyFy's Expanse.....now imagine adapting anime/manga with the same budget.

Obviously it's a very dangerous gamble, but one that could help revitalise the anime industry.

The reason most movie adaptions fail to deliver is that they try to cram the story of a 12+ episode series in the span of 2-3 hours.

This has always been my dream, but I have always wanted a mecha TV show with a large budget and american writers.

An example of an anime/manga that could really work in this form is [Break Blade](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22433/Break_Blade).

One of the first mecha anime I watched, it's interesting enough to create a captivating story and bland enough to give writers leeway to adapt the story how they want to (without fans getting *that* angry).

	<TEXT> From The Dark Knight onwards, they really dial up the growl factor even during normal conversations.

I've noticed that as well, it's almost as if Nolan is parodying Batman's voice in TDK...which is extremely odd.

It becomes slightly unbearable and downright comedic in TDKR </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But twins. That's cheesy.

That's the point.

It's an extremely bad lie that's covered up by both Perry and Bruce to fix the problem of Superman's death caused.

It's almost a meta joke, Superman is Kal El acting like John to hide the fact that he's Clark Kent......and Superman.

It's the only way his fellow reporters could accept a man that looks **exactly** the same as their dead colleague.  </TEXT>
