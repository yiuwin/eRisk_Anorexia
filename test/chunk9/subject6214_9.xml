	<TEXT> I will sometimes do this if I'm alone in a room and have enemies nearby on the minimap. I'll shoot a wall to attract them to my location then I will hide and shoot them. Works a treat to attract defenders away from the cargo before running for my life to grab it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, I am a University student studying games design. Here is a level I am working on. I wondering if there was anything I could do to improve the visuals in my level. I feel it looks very flat as would just like any advice on how I could flesh it out.

TL;DR - How can I make my level look less "flat"

EDIT - Sorry for the moments when the video lags. My mouse has broken and I am unable to afford a new one at the moment. So a 1.00 mouse needed to suffice) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a heads up, Kerplunk is missing from the list ;) I'm psyched to be a part of this!

EDIT - I've had an idea for choosing a guitarist. We could possibly use /r/GreenDayCovers for this. We could have 30 second auditions for each song uploaded to YouTube, then have a strawpoll to vote on who gets the song? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have seen all the suggested reading orders but I was wondering if there were any benefits/consequences of reading them in publication order? (Almost finished my first Discworld book, The Colour of Magic, so happy I took the time to!) 

UPDATE - Thanks for the comments!! I'll read them all in publication order! :)

UPDATE 2 - I've just finished The Colour of Magic! The ending certainly  took me by surprise! I knew where Rincewind ended up as I read the blurb of The Light Fantastic when I purchased it, but the way he got there was very cool! I'm really looking forward to this series!! </TEXT>
