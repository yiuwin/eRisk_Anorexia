	<TEXT> Well look at this positively: in the exam if there's ever a question about ANT+ you can say it's outdated and suggest alternatives and as a result, show that you've done secondary research on the topic. I don't think the IB is outdated as such, and definitely not for their case study; It's rather giving you a hint about what the questions could be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did one and I'm still not sure how I've done until I get my grade for it. But I had a friend who did it on the Octopus card system in Japan and he probably made the primary data up considering we all live far from Japan but he got an A and I followed how he did his. It's not that tough but it gets boring after a while and you won't feel like writing anymore. I know people who did theirs with their full interest because they did a topic they liked in History or English Literature. Just make sure that you can maintain interest in a topic if you're doing it in ITGS. </TEXT>
