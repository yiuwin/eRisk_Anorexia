	<TEXT> Well, then you aren't going to like my answer! If you can't build a website from scratch using the basics then you aren't ready for a framework. You need to have to have a really good understanding of the basics or you will be doing yourself a disservice.

I certainly am looking to master the basics, what I came here looking for is a video or interactive tutorial showing me how to build a complete, modern website from scratch, if you can recommend a better way for me to learn what I need to apply for my first frontend dev job, i'll be happy to know about it :) 

For example, here is the stack I use on a daily basis:
React, redux, relay, graphql, a myriad of other react tools, Ramda, immutable, THREE js, d3, webpack, jest, enzyme, ava and that is just the front end.

all of this is waaaay over my head at the moment

Ill come back and link you to some resources when I get home.

very much appreciated
