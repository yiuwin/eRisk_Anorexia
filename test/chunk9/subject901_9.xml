	<TEXT> They had a Futurama team up (Just Maurice and Tress) but why do that when I you can get everyone from pretty much every cartoon? 

From memory:
Rob Paulsen - Yakko, Pinky, Rafael from old TMNT and Donatello from new, Mighty Max, voices on The Boondocks, old chained up guy in El Superbeasto, the mascot in Rick and Morty Anatomy Park and coned nipple person in Unity episode, etc.

Jess Harnell - Wakko, Captain Hero, one of the Transformers (I believe Starscream), the bear on The Cleveland Show after Seth stopped playing him, Rick and Morty Anatomy Park episode he was the other guy in the body, he is a very talented singer in Rock Sugar, 

Tress Macneille - Dot and pretty much every other woman voice in cartoons. Seriously. 

Maurice LaMarche - The Brain, Kif, Calculon, Abradolf Lincler, Orsen Wells, Im pretty sure you can hear him on Lexus commercials, etc.

These four people have been there with us every since we were kids. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They walked up to random people waiting in line. I will use their character names and not their real names to make it easier and because they were using their cartoon voices a majority of the time. Yakko shook everyone's hand. I was standing next to a red headed lady and he walked up to us and said, "Hello, red head! Hello, red hat!" As Yakko was talking to another woman, Wakko ran up behind him and was like, "Alright, give someone else a turn!" Dot and Brain weren't as interactive but just as nice. They said hi to everyone and cracked jokes. When getting the photo, it wasn't rushed like most cons. I shook all their hands, thanked them for my childhood, gave them the Pops and told them, "It's so my mom can identify you". They had never seen them in person, from their reaction. As I was done, I personally thanked Wakko. I told him I had an older brother and a younger sister. He replied, "Oh, so you know how I feel!" I giggled. Then told him I thought his band Rock Sugar was amazing. He gave me a fistbump. Ive met a few celebs at past cons. This was the best, by far. </TEXT>

Buuuuut why show Beth, Jerry, and Summer a device to where they can see alternate versions of themselves if its something he cant emotionally handle?

	<TEXT> I also got to see the Chicago Post Office (the bank with the bus going around and bursting out of), Trump Tower (Bruce's place where he looked upon Gotham...but that pic is of me flipping it off) and under the L Train (where Bruce drives the black Lamborghini). These were also great stops, but the first shot of the movie is iconic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it's fair to say Troy Baker is The Mimic. It does make sense, but he did a good job to have to follow in the footsteps of Hamill. If he did it his own way, the game would have been garbage. There are many who do say the game wasn't great, but the Red Hood flashback was amazing. </TEXT>

I just started this arch and it's pretty good. Good thing about is is the volumes start right after the next and arent really spread out. I know volume 2 picks up right after volume 1 and that one is a long read. Near 20 issues

	<TITLE> TIFU by turning a gas station bathroom into what looked like a crime scene </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-02 16:00:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was walking into a gas station and I stepped on a broken bottle. Not really ON it but it sliced the side of my toe (wearing flip flops) enough to cause a bit of bleeding. I make it inside, grab a few napkins and soak up most of the blood. After waiting my turn in line I ask the old lady behind the counter if she has a band aid because I had just stepped on glass in the parking lot. She asked me if I was wearing shoes. 
I hobble to the bathroom. On one wall and corner, I have the sink with soap dispenser. On the other wall and corner is the toilet paper dispenser. The first two minutes was me going back and forth, bleeding on the floor, trying to clean my wound enough to put a band aid on and get home to clean it up better. After several trips from sink to toilet paper, I had the bright idea to just grab a bunch of toilet paper and then lean against the sink near the soap dispenser. After finally getting enough soap on my foot, I attempt to put on the band aid and then...FWOMP! I rip the sink right out of the wall and onto the floor. It's not gushing out water, but it is no longer attached and sitting up straight. The bathroom looked like a small crime scene into which someone was violently thrown into the sink and bled all over the ground. I panicked...and left. 
I feel bad for not saying anything to the old lady working there. There was another line, longer than before, and I didn't feel like leaving more DNA at the scene of the crime. I might go back to that gas station someday and confess. I need to start wearing actual shoes again. </TEXT>
