	<TEXT> Agreed. There was not enough lavender in either of their outfits to suggest a Ro wedding. You know if he got married Mateo would be ring bearer in a lavender tux.

Edit: Actually, I'm rewatching the scene and Mateo is wearing a lavender tie... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm looking forward to some Alba/Jane time since they are both widows now /3

I can't remember which episode, but we did see Alba on Mateo Sr's birth/death day (?) lock herself in what looked like the same room Jane was in during the preview for next week. Hopefully Jane will let Alba be there for her even though Alba couldn't at the time  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you mean to respond to my comment? I only ask because I didn't say that I was afraid of the world thinking we were bigots. Lord knows it's not the first time America was viewed negatively by other countries. I was raising my concerns about state legislature that may cause some supporters of President-elect Trump to act out and terrorize others who they see as different or lesser.

But to address your comment, I don't think it's okay for our leaders to be corrupt, but I do not believe that Clinton is a criminal. She has never been convicted of a crime, and I trust that the FBI knows a lot more than I do when it comes to her actions. Again, her policies lined up best for me, so I voted for her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I respect that. Because that's exactly why I voted for Clinton. Her policy goals lined up best for me and I truly believe that her environmental goals were the best for everybody.

What I don't respect and what I'm against is the rhetoric President-elect Trump used during his campaign and how some of his user base is responding. That's something we agree on. I don't want discriminatory laws passed in the states that lead to citizens feeling like it's okay to terrorize people. That's what I'm against and to be honest, slightly afraid of. </TEXT>

I apologize if you think I was being smug. That wasn't my intention. I do feel bad for you that you immediately reject any kind of sympathy or attempt at reasoning and again I honestly hope that you stop feeling so sad.

You can think that my perceived superiority is a turnoff to others. That's okay. That's what I love about this country and what I love about you. You are exercising your right to express yourself, just as I am. Your voice and vote counts just as much as mine does. </TEXT>
