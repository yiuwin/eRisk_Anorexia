	<TEXT> I guess this is sort of a test of the new rules... I don't remember if this was in the rules before but, No extraneous objects in frame? No desk? Personally I think it's important to show that it's a drawing made in a sketchbook and that you can see sort of how big it is and in its natural environment. Also this way it's not misstaken for digital art as easily.  Anyways, I hope you like it and if it breaks the rules I guess thats that :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is really nothing to see, I just sit down with a ballpoint pen and a blank paper and start drawing. If you draw a portrait or an animal or anything like that there are techniques to do so and make it look realistic, this is another way of drawing. I have an old video of me doing that but it would gain you nothing to see it.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, Nothing inspired me to start drawing, it sort of just happened as soon as I figured out how pens worked at a very young age.  However then I just kept on drawing pretty much until I found my style. I did write about how I came up with my style and things around that in a blog a couple of years ago, I gave up on it quickly though. But I think it might answer all your questions. Part 1 and part 2 are not in a continuous order but they are named part 1 and part 2 so if you just scroll a little ;)
