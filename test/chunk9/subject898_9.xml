	<TEXT> I believe the reason they can refer to it like that without sounding like morons is because it will be done similarly to The Jungle Book, with some actual sets and filming things on camera before doing the animation. This gives them the ability to film it live action, but still make it basically a completely animated film. This made sense in Jungle Book since the kid was live action, but I'm not sure I see the point for Lion King. I'm optimistic though because Favreau is my guy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jesse Eisenberg has more than proven himself with films like The Social Network, Adventureland, Zomebieland, etc. He is definitely entertaining in the right role. Same with Miles Teller, he is innarguably a good actor, just hasnt had that many good roles yet. Also I totally disagree that you could have put anyone in Teller's role in Whiplash, he was nowhere near Simmons but he himself was still very good in the film. </TEXT>
