	<TEXT> This is what I had hoped for from No Man's Sky.  Let's look past the bugs and glitches for a second.  I've had few games where i'm genuinly excited for the next 'stage' or step or item.  I played with my friend online and we've had several moments where we'd say, 'ok, one more item and i'm off' and 3 hours later we still can't pry ourselves away.  Elder scrolls are the only other game i could think of that gave me that feeling.   If you haven't downloaded it yet, give it a try.

Oh, did I mention its only 19.99?  Double score.

(multiplayer didn't work during the trial for me, i did work once we both bought the game). </TEXT>
