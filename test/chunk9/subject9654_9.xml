	<TEXT> Yep  it's a sterotype for a reason.

In prison in australia they had to build a separate centre for pedos in  NSW  just to keep them away as they got fucked up so often.
One rock spider got  barb wire shoved up his ass  at  silverwater in the 90s.
Another guy at bathurst jail had boiling water poured into his ears and mouth untill his body shut down from shock.
They will fuck ur shit up.
real fast and real hard

Almost all criminals have family.
it's pretty much the one rule no matter what ur crime is   that u don't break.
Don't fuck with family or kids

Same goes for drug dealers.
If they find out u peddle to school kids ur gonna get necked as well.

The above posters commetns pretty true.
in the old days   they would put u in the yard.
and the guard would go for a "SMOKO"  or be "BUSY"  when he comes back in 2 mins he's either beat to shit.
or dead.

Why i tell anyone steer clear of any isp that is sub 80 a month for unlimited. the math's just doesnt work out  in ur favour.

Well no shit.
Ur paying 59 bucks for unlimited 100mbit  cut's are being made.
When it costs u 54.20 Alone just to get that service provisioned from NBNco    shits gonna break.

Ive noticeed most of the complaints seem to be anyone that's rocking on AAPT's network as they seem to stupidly do core router maintance   at 6pm on a weekday instead of at 3am on a weekend lol. </TEXT>

Im not opposed to taxes.

Im opposed to the govt telling us it needs more money for NBN rollouts to cover regional installs.
when they are the ones who take the money off them in the first place.

1. it only needs that money cause the LNP keep fucking with the budget of NBNco. 
2.Senate have tried to pass through ammendements going back to the HOR  to make sure funding shortfalls don't happen.
3.CVC charges are meant to cover this. at 12.50 per a MBit and currently  1.92 million users on the NBN  that's  hundreds of millions  so where the fuck is that going?.
4.If the "tax" was really to pay for nbn then lock it in with the legislation don't just be able to come by and take the money for whatever make ur mind up

i mean the whole idea sounds like some  cash con.
well boys.
RobotDebt didn't work.
let's take money off the NBN users as our  conservative base hates the NBN anyway  so it's no loss to us </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Problem is apparently the  tax isn't even linked to Nbn.
Nothing to stop them taking the money and using it elsewhere .

If it's really for the Nbn lock the funding to it.
This just seems like a cheap ploy cause liberal base doesn't  seem to care for the Nbn </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One plus 3t.

Easily best phone ive ever bought for the value.

Cameras pretty good.
Yeah it doesnt have band 28.
But i get 45Mbit anyway on the other 4g band's u don't need much more than that.

Great build quality  and you can grab them for 540 bucks or less if they have a sale going.
Plus that stock android feel pretty much is great.
The new one plus 5 is out in june so keen to see what they do.

V20's a pretty good phone as well.
As they say..Cheap phones are getting good,and good phones are getting cheap </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pm the dude.

He's the person that was leaking all the Centrelink shit to the press and stuff.

Most of his post's seem to line up with what's published the next day or 2 in  the guardian and abc  so ive come to trust his posts.

I really don't care about the jets personally either way.
But if they are crying that we are broke as fucking all hell for 3 years.
and see's a payment that doesn't need to be made.
or a tax cut that be removed, and don't do it. but then cut services instead fuck them.

Something about the payments not even due till  2018/19  for the first deployment phase.

Yet must pay it now as even though apparently we are broke  but  i spose in LNP eyes that's "GOOD DEBT" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The user that everyone's talking about.
And we all know who it is.

You can't have a debate with when they make a comment.
Post ZERO evidence to back the claim up.
Then leaves when get's called on it.

Then complains the next day that they are being maligned.

Much like the poster above last week claiming a certain LAbor prime minister Lied about everything.
Citations, where asked for none got given.
A debate is back and forth.
Posting a comment as fact is not a debate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah except i didn't say that did i . So why lie.
while users are posting lies and unsubstantiated crap week after week.
There should be no personal attacks. But if another user being stupid you have every right to tell them that.

Why not go pick on some lefties of in roz?

My response was if someone acting like a tool you have every right to call them on it if they still don't listen then they forgo the right to not be called a tool
