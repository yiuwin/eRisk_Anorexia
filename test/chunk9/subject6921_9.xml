	<TEXT> update: I went ahead and took it to a auto repair shop. radiator needs replaced and it needs needs front left lights. it'll cost a little over $500. I wouldnt price it more then $500, but I can't really afford to get a new one so I'm hoping this fix will help the car last atleast another year. Its kinda a gamble because theres always a chance of engine damage when a car overheats. So I'm hoping for the best </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Drinking in the Bible vs modern day christian americans </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-19 15:57:36 </DATE>

	<TEXT>  Growing up as a pastors kid I was taught alcohol was bad. It seems to be a thing in America to demonize alcohol. I know the Bible says to remain sober, but then it encourages drinking wine and other alcoholic beverages. there is a difference between drinking a beer or glass of wine and getting passed out drunk. In my opinion, demonizing alcohol causes more problems then not. Once a young adult is out of the house and is thrown into a world where its ok to drink they have no experience or examples of responsible drinking. So I'm curious what you guys think and what reasons maybe drinking is worth demonizing. As a christian who has been an acting member of a church I've been taught to reframe from drinking and even been in "trouble" from evidence that I had. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im kinda in a fix. Im a college student working a minimum wage job barely making ends meet. I drive a 1998 cavalier passed down through the family. it has over 180,000 miles. Last week I was in a minor accident and thought the only thing that needed fixed was a light, but on my way home from work it overheated. Im going to auto repair shop tomorrow to see whats up. I'm not sure I want to put another 500+ in a car that not even worth 500. Should i continue  paying to keep the thing running as long as I can or get a new (used) car. I have 2k and could make a downpayment on a car, but not sure adding 100+ to my monthly bills is realistic. Ive been told my Cavalier has a oil leak that could cost up to 1k to fix, plus there is no heater, and no radio. Id hate to put another $500-1k in this car and have the engine, transmission, etc give out... but can't really afford to get a decent car with cash and unsure about making monthly payments on a car.  </TEXT>

Im returning to college next fall. longterm goal is id like to do freelance/online work as a web developer/programmer.   If i could brush up some data entry skills could I get a job online or is this a high skilled job? thanks. I know, lots of questions.

	<TEXT> I currently looking to finish an A.S. in IT and take other certification courses at my local community college( and possible get a BS). My goal is to have a web developer or programmer job. Im currently learning using online resources. I see a lot of data entry jobs near me and some even online(which would be awesome). Question is how hard is it to get these jobs. They don't pay a lot, but they would definitely help me earn more money then minimum wage.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Moved away from friends,family </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-12 06:24:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Well technically no, I live with my sister. Its been 3 months and ive wondered if I made a mistake. I'm 24 and moved away from several long friendships and most of my family. I'm not finished with school and hope to complete where I'm at(fort worth, Tx). Financially I'm barely making it and I haven't made any connections. I want to stay, but afraid that I'm giving up meaningful relationships. Also I'm terrible at long distance friendship and I'm very introverted so it's hard for me to make new friends. My friends back home are moving out of there parents and asked if I wanted to join, but rent will be too much for me to do both and college. Im just been conflicted. Any advice? Will I be thankful if I stick it out? I like the city, but I'm concerned Ill regret leaving in the future </TEXT>
