	<TEXT> Unfortunately, only longswords have this unique strain of weapons, and there are miniseries of glaives within this set.

Mighty Glaive: Galaxy Chief

Bewitched Glaive: Receding Rust (Objectively Best), Bewitched Glaive: Blood Dance

Signature Glaive: Alleigance (Personal Favorite), Signature Glaive: Four Virtues, Signature Glaive: Fledgling (Nagi's blade)

Ethereal Glaive: Helldragon

These are all the unique longswords, as well as the only strain of weapon in the game like it. Sucks that these don't exist for the other weapons, I would have liked to see a unique javelin series. Something like "Shining Lance: Collapsing Star," or something nonsensical like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of it. No, seriously, this is a 100% completion LP. He tends to play the story in relevant chunks, so after a certain arc ends, he does a lot of sidequesting, which can go on for episodes. Make no mistake, none of this is is tedious to watch at all cuz Chugga knows how to captivate the audience, and he's pretty good mechanically. Personally, I think that I watched his LP not for the game, but for the wit, charm, and humor of the commentary accompanying it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just curious to see what people go for now. I remember back when I started, people liked to do cool armor sets, but now, I see more casual clothing/lighter wear.

	<TEXT> Also, try to find a group of people to play with online, IRL friends or Internet friends, it really doesn't matter either way, but it makes the online content in the game a lot more enjoyable, instead of just a way to get tickets when Yggralith Zero is dead. You can friend me if you want, NNID: subject416020, I play with a large group of guys that enjoy helping out newer/struggling players, and just fucking around online in general. </TEXT>
