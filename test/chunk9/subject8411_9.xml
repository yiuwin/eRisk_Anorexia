	<TEXT> Hey guys, I'm currently at Bronze V after being in Bronze II last season. And in both seasons I've had an extremely hard time climbing at all. It feels to me like I'm playing to the skill of the people that I'm around. Most games I try not to feed and I feel like my builds are good but it always seems like me or someone else feeds and we lose. I'm really frustrated and don't know what to do to improve and climb the ladder. It seems like when I go on a win streak I immediately go on a losing streak just as long. This has happened to me consistently since I started ranked. I feel like I can hold my own with my Gold/Silver friends when I play with them but the second I get into a Solo game it all goes to hell. Any advice would be awesome.

Summoner name: Chaseair

Op.gg: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=chaseair

I can also get replays of my next game if needed.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I figured I would do a comprehensive post outlining my entire (extensive) history on HCF plus some final words.


MAP 3: I joined the server, I tried super hard to hack it, realized that I couldn't. Decided to join a small two man faction with a random dude from spawn called Amnesia. We made a dirt hut and then both died. RIP, stopped playing for the map.


MAP 4: I joined the map and fucked around, I remember clearly wandering around in the wilderness when pikaoku betrayed Bank(a big freaking deal). And then promptly dying to a creeper :c. I discovered the site and subreddit and started shopping around for a faction. I found one in the form of [ShadowWalk] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hcfactions/comments/vbfr5/my_first_kill_raid_long/)

At the bottom of that post is my first attempt at getting into a faction, and no, mrme never got that massage. Anyways, I joined Shadowwalk and had an absolute BLAST! Even though I sucked at minecraft and blamed my deaths on [glitches] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hcfactions/comments/vvyvk/my_death_story/). The map ended and I logged in during EOTW and got one shotted. Yay.


MAP 5: My favorite map EVER. I got my first kill(yay!) and joined ShadowWalk again. This time I had my first somewhat fair pvp [encounter with legobrah] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hcfactions/comments/wky25/fucking_legobrah/) lol. After that I joined and didn't die very much, or so I like to think. A reason why this was the best map for me was the amount of pure fun I had [dicking around with my factionmates](http://imgur.com/a/VnrdT). I actually sorta participated in EOTW, AKA I was the first death in the Hypnotoad alliance. Yay fun times.

MAP 6: ShadowWalk again, nothing much really happened this map excpet that ShadowWalk had a KICK ASS base. I also got betrayed by braandenjames, nevr frget.


MAP 7: I decided to give leading a shot, this was the first draft map. I led Apocalypse and had a fairly decent roster. We capped the first KOTH and thats really it. We went raidable and everyone left. I joined Shotzvee's Tyrants and had lots of fun with everyone in it. Also, at one point I was the only person online and I went around and humped everyones bases. Pretty much went inactive near the end.


MAP 8: I joined only to play in the HCFCity or whatever, then left that shitshow and betrayed EagelBagels faction. Or at least tried to. I forgot that I couldn't attack him on his own land and he killed me with a bowl. I quit afterwards.


MAP 9: Didn't play for the first bit of the map. After a bit I joined ThirdLaw with TravisArmstrong, Pkeffect, and Torremth. That was quite fun and my first experience with a truly rich faction. I left near the end to play with my friend and died during EOTW in a 50v1 with Alpha.


MAP 10: Basically played solo this map, my friend tried to play with me but we went pretty inactive. Nothing much happened here.

MAP 10.5: Joined the ShadowWalk revival, had fun here but it went inactive and I left and joined Freeshot, I met lots of people there and it eventually fell apart and I dipped. Then I joined conan's 8BALL. Met loads of people I still keep in touch with today and I still remember Stabbd and austindibble having a small bitch fight every day.... ah good times.

MAP 12: Lucky7! And TastyCake! I joined a Trading faction for the first time and had no fucking clue what I was doing. PVP called me too much and I left for Lucky7. Played the rest of the map and had so much fun with all of my good friends from that faction. Probably my second favorite map.


MAP 13: Battletoads was the main and only faction I was in. Shame it went raidable after like a week. I just chilled in spawn and applied for watcher. Got it and had to wait for the next map.

MAP 14-16: Watcher maps! I had a ton of fun with all of my watcher buddies (most of which became admins). I got demoted eventually for /warning Highlife and not recording enough.

MAP 17: I played with CookieClan for the majority of the map and started to find my niche with PVP, finally had a positive K/D ratio.


MAP 18: Hopped around mostly, eventually settled down with DuckClan and further expanded my circle of friends. Eventually went inactive and took a break for a bit. 


MAP 19: Again tried to create a faction: Axis, had a thrity man roster but it was 90% full of noobs because I wanted to give them all a chance to be known. Turns out I did my job because many of them have gone on to do great things. I'm proud of you all!

MAP 20: I logged in twice this whole map I believe.

MAP 21: Also did not play this map.

MAP 22: Again barely played, had a small solo faction for the majority of the map. Actually got decently set up but got really bored and went inactive.

MAP 23: Got slightly active and tried to get into a faction, at this point I was pretty tired of MC and rarely logged on anymore, fairly boring map for me.


MAP 24: Missed SOTW, I joined GreasyGoons near the Edn of this map for Palace and EOTW, had my first good gaming rig at this point and my pvp improved alot. I had my first big palace fight and survived! 


MAP 25: Didn't participate much. Screwed around in spawn for the majority. I started some outside work for the draft map at this point also. I did the infamous rankings. I spent around a week working on them and they were met with.. mixed reviews.. But it happened!

MAP 26: The Draft Map! I led Apocalypse and I thought that finally I was gonna lead a faction that lasted until EOTW... Well... Didn't happen. We lasted around 2 weeks and then fell apart due to inactivity and stupid players. I joined Legendary and we were LOADED. And I FINALLY won my first ever EOTW with BumBoys. 

MAP 27: Have not done anything really, became a watcher again and recorded some cheaters. Everyone is inactive and HCF is gone. 

I'm sad to see it go but I guess all good things must come to an end... I t's sad but I feel myself getting emotional at the loss of this thing that's been such a massive part of my life.. I think back fondly to my noob days and am saddened that I can't go back and that others won't be able to experience the same.. But, it had to happen...

	<TEXT> It's been an amazing run guys. I'm actually getting slightly emotional at the thought of HCF closing its doors for good. Being a part of this server for 3 years has been one of the most positive experiences of my life. It's truly had an impact on my life. I want to say thank you Higlhlife and thank you to all of the people who have been amazing to play with. You all rock </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've just gotten level 30 and I've seen all the posts saying DONT PLAY RANKED. But I honestly feel like with so many matches under my belt, the tons of practice that I've put in, and overall knowledge of champions that I have. That I can compete in ranked. Am I delusional? Is the gap between normals and ranked that huge? I'm just looking for other people to have input before I jump in. Thanks! </TEXT>
