	<TEXT> My friends went camping near a lake one weekend. The rangers around there are known for dropping in to make sure they're isn't under age drinking or drug use (we live in a two college town). They can be really strict. 

So my friends decided to scavenge for fire wood, which is also against the rules, but it's late and they figured it wouldn't be an issue. It's dark as they comb through the woods looking for dead and fallen branches. Suddenly my friend sees a figure in the dark. The figure has just been standing there in the darkness, not moving. My friend calls out to the other friend that he sees someone. At that the figure moves forward as my friends shine their flashlights at it. It's a park ranger. He was just standing there in the dark watching all of them, then followed the two that were searching for wood. 

They drop their modest wood collection, startled by the stranger in the darkness.  As they shine their flashlights on the ranger they can see he's covered in spiders. Naturally, they recoil and inform him that he's covered in spiders. He replies, "They're just harmless orb spiders, they'll roll right off you."

Creepy af. It's now the source of campfire horror stories.

TLDR: park ranger covered in spiders stood silently in the darkness in the woods watching our camping group. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good video for those who have never panicked or seen someone panic. When I was 12, I panicked at my check-out dive and my reaction was to swim to the surface which isn't a good idea when you're 70ft down. Luckily I had a cool as a cucumber dive master as my partner who got me under control and breathing calmy again. 

Afterward, he stressed the importance of not shooting to the surface. I'm glad I went through it though, it made me wiser. Calm is the number one thing you want be when you're under there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for helping to explain that people who dive around sharks aren't crazy people with a death wish. Sharks are so misunderstood in the public's eye.  

Approximately 11,000 sharks are killed hourly by humans, and only about 6 humans are killed annually by sharks. Hourly vs. Annually. It's good to keep some perspective on this issue. 

Granted, if a shark is terrifying to you, that's okay. That's a healthy fear. But they're not mindless human killing machines. Not by a long shot. 

The specimen in the video is so fascinating that I'm sure everyone in and around that boat was enthralled in pure awe. And that's what sharks deserve. They deserve our respect and a little bit of awe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly, I'd like to say how beautiful your cosplay is; even if your skin was purple it would still be an excellent cosplay. I can't imagine why anyone would hassle you over the color of your skin, ESPECIALLY when it comes to Jasmine! You're coloring is perfect for her!

Secondly, what you wrote really spoke to me. I also made a Jasmine cosplay for a friend's murder mystery party, so not Comic Con level stuff. I was assigned Jasmine, or "Jasmoor" since no one wants to be sued by Disney. We originally had our choice of character however none of the girls wanted to take Jasmine, most likely due to the fact none of us wanted our bellies hanging out all night. Anyway, I am assigned Jasmine. 

Being a very pale red-head, I decided to take Jasmine's look in a different direction. I wanted the overall costume to easily be noticed as Jasmine, so I kept that pretty classic Disney-style. I knew I couldn't pull off the olive skin and black hair, so I stuck with my natural coloring and went with a [Red-headed Jasmine.](http://imgur.com/a/91Zl0)

Is it different? Yes. Did people tell me I got Jasmine wrong? Yes. But WHO CARES!? I had a blast hand making the costume, and I had a blast at the murder mystery party. It's ridiculous that people think there is a right or wrong way to cosplay, but there's not. It doesn't matter your age, skin color, hair color, body shape or cosplay budget. The point is to have fun making it, have fun wearing it and have fun sharing it.

So bully for you for standing up and defending your frankly stunning cosplay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. My town has a local arts and jazz Fest in one of our parks every year. The grounds are difficult to get through due to the way the park is designed. There are 2 footbridges you have to cross to get to the other end of the Fest. One of these bridges is about  30 ft. long and is only about 5 ft wide. It always causes a large bottleneck. 

One year, I am trying to cross this bridge, after waiting in a 5 min line to even get onto the bridge. As I get to the middle of the bridge there is a group of high schoolers just stopped in the middle of the damn bridge talking to each other. The Fest crowd seems to just maneuver around the chatty cathys one at a time bc the bridge is so narrow. Seeing this, I tell the dumb children to please move their conversation to the end of the bridge so people with wheelchairs and strollers can get by. 


One of the little piss-ants looks up at me and tells me to "fuck off." My mouth fell open. How could someone so stupid respond to a simple request with such nastiness? I smacked the kid on the top of the head and told him to shut his little shit mouth and move before I physically make them. The girls laughed ran off and the snot nosed boys went after them. 

Now my job at the Fest is to yell at people who stop on the bridge to talk, like some kind of Festival Bridge Troll. But really, common sense should have prevailed here. 

I blame the parents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. I really need my multiple attacks to be of any real use. But I would honestly take 1 attack of it meant doing any kind of real damage. Right now my longbow has 1 d6 of lighting damage which seems to be the only thing that remotely harms the skeletons. And 1 d6 is laughable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've attempted the fire arrows before but it takes a lot of time to light the each arrow, which would take away from my multiple attacks, and my GMs mentioned that it wouldn't fire the same. We never got around to it being a viable option. But I really appreciate the idea. That's what this post is all about! Ideas! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Archer Ranger fighting skeletons </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-21 00:41:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all! I'm a Ranger who has leveled up in archery and not much else. I'm currently in a dungeon with a ton of undead. Now, the undead aren't too much of a problem for me, but I do run into trouble when I fight skeletons. 

As an archer, I rely on piercing damage mostly and it's seen me through most of the campaign. However, now that I'm fighting a bunch of skellys, I'm basically worthless. I have a light mace but it is embarrassingly inadequate since most of my skills and feats lie in archery. 

I'd love to hear any suggestions you guys may have, as I am nowhere near clearing this expansive dungeon. Thanks!

Edit: I forgot to mention that we are playing with CRB only. My GMs won't allow blunted arrows. So any other ideas would be greatly appreciated. 

Huzzah to you all! </TEXT>
