	<TEXT> Honestly, I don't think it is fair to compare Saint Seiya with Bleach, Kurumada's manga was much more constant than Kubo's. Did they try to bring it back with Omega? Yes, but it didn't work, that's why they created Soul of Gold, which in my opinion only worked for nostalgia feelings. There is a manga on going, Next Dimension, and people really want to see Lost Canvas to continue its anime production, which was really good. Objectively speaking, even though I like Bleach, it lacks the strength that Saint Seiya has. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TOEFL que as universidade aplicam gratuitamente **e que servia como forma de ingresso para o CSF** era fcil, sim. Qualquer um com 3 meses de estudo se sairia razoavelmente bem a ponto de tirar uma nota que lhe permitisse no s participar, mas como ingressar em uma universidade estrangeira.

Posso estar sendo *fanboy* neste quesito, mas acredito que os **exames de Cambridge tm muito mais credibilidade** do que o TOEFL, algum que tira uma nota excelente no FCE, para mim,  mais capaz do que quem tira uma nota excelente no TOEFL. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eu recebi nos meus recomendados do youtube o vdeo de uma jovem que era aluna da USP, mas desistiu do curso de Fsica porque, supostamente, os professores eram ruins e sem didtica. Entretanto, ela tambm diz algo nas linhas "so poucas as pessoas que se formam na durao certinha do curso, essas realmente abdicam da vida social para estudar, mas perdem as melhores coisas da faculdade". So pessoas assim que eu imagino que usufruiam do Cincias sem Fronteiras, gente que acha que **faculdade  s farra**, minha me j me ensinava "primeiro o dever, depois o lazer",  bom ir para choppadas, festas e afins? Claro, mas se voc estuda em uma faculdade pblica e depois de j ter entrado faz pouco caso da vaga colocando os estudos em ltimo lugar, realmente no  de se esperar muito destes "alunos" que vo para o exterior.

No vou, tambm, falar que a culpa  s nossa, me incluo porque apesar de no ser assim j fui aluno de universidade pblica, mas **a forma que o governo tem de testar o ingls  pfia**, onde j se viu aplicar a modalidade mais simples do TOEFL sem nem mesmo uma aferio oral  cobrada como forma de saber se o aluno est apto ou no para a mobilidade internacional?

 uma lstima saber que um programa como esse, que tinha tudo para ser o motor do desenvolvimento do ensino superior brasileiro, foi por gua abaixo s porque no passou pela cabea da administrao pblica que uma prova simples como a do TOEFL fosse suficiente para que alunos daqui soubessem se virar no ingls l fora.

Para variar, **o barato saiu caro** e dessa vez a culpa no foi toda da Dilma. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you are all missing the point here, so I'll explain since I have  a degree in astrophysics from the Astrophysics Institution Database of Sydney (or A.I.D.S. for shorten) and I was a former **ass**tronaut. 

We live in a galaxy called Milky Way, if you break down to its roots you will surprisingly notice that Milky Way and the word "milk" are similar, that is not a coincidence. Following the latest trend that was already an omen for your question, which can be seen [here](https://thumbs.mic.com/ZjQ4NTRjMjhiZCMvX0xwS3lmRU1XZ2FGRWdNVjBmWG9iVGxzWVhBPS80MHgwOjIzNTN4MTE5My8xNjAweDkwMC9maWx0ZXJzOmZvcm1hdChqcGVnKTpxdWFsaXR5KDgwKS9odHRwczovL3MzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20vcG9saWN5bWljLWltYWdlcy9ybWk5d3IwcGxhMnVxNDJzaTRoeXMxa2hjd29xazhvbXk5dWZ4bXEyaDl2am1jbmRrc2t1dGdudmlyZHB5dXB3LmpwZw.jpg), you will understand why the logic from /u/TheCreatorLovesYou is perfectly done, Earth not only is a pizza, but it is also dipped in the milk(y way). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Shibas and stitches removal, how do they react? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-02 02:07:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My shiba had an entropion (an eyelids surgery) so we had him under a surgery to grant him a better well-being, his vet told me I should use some meds 3x a day until we go back there and have her remove his stitches, but the thing is, she gave me two options either I go to a vet clinic that is nearer our house and I help her remove the stitches by holding Ichi, or I go to another vet clinic which is quite far - he is not used to travel by car and gets really irritated - but she will have the "help" - I say "help" because I saw how the helper gave her a hand before - from the clinic's assistant. He 95% of the times is completely submissive in vet clinics.

So I ask a general question, being shibas the way they are how would they react by someone removing stitches from them? How did your shiba react to it? Did he behave well?

Edit: So we had his stitches removed last Saturday, he had 13 stitches but being the calm and patient creature he is when he has the Elizabethan collar he managed to remove on his own 3 - not enough to damage the tissue, so the vet had to remove 10, 9 of those were easy I even had to do anything, but the last one, it was more difficult, she could remove, but she said his own body would reject the last stitch, so for any of you looking here in the future beware that it's not because they are small they don't have strength, two people were holding him with his belly up - more stressful but quicker - and still she didn't manage to remove. 

He's recovering now, his right eye isn't very shiba like now, but at least his eyelids won't bother him anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are basing your opinion on how good a movie is just because it is related to a video game and comparing it to other movies video game related and that a "6 on IMDB" is a good score, I'm sorry but you are being just a fanboy and not critically seeing the movie as it is, **a movie**. I said the movie was bad, put it against other movies and it is still bad, now if you want to compare Assassin's Creed with Street Fighter, for instance, be my guest and call it good; but I won't, both of those are bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe you thought it was a good movie, but go check the critics, the movie was bad, it won't get a sequel, if it was as good as you said it would definitely get a second one, but that is not going to happen, at least not in the near future. Sometimes people have to learn to differentiate when a good movie is really good, and when a movie is related to something that you like.

I love the AC series, there isn't a game that I didn't enjoy, but it takes honesty to say: "the movie was bad, it could be good but it wasn't, we won't be seeing a sequel" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say so, or maybe it is what is left implicit on Skyrim. If the DB hasn't a listener, contracts can't be made, so that leads to one of the first things that Astrid tells you, that she will arrange the contracts and if by that she meant waiting people to perform the black sacrament and then by coincidence, like in Aventus' case, hear about it, the brotherhood wouldn't last long. IMO there wouldn't be rogue assassins because: 

1. If people wanted to contact the DB, the DB wouldn't send a novice for the contact, and even if it would, they would report back to their superior;
2. All of them have a high respect for Astrid, even Babette, so they wouldn't try to rip off her </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Voc acha que tem poucos? Se considerarmos os feriados nacionais que podem afetar o calendrio escolar e administrativo so 7 (desconsiderei 1/1 e 25/12), os mveis somam 5 (Carnaval - so dois dias, Quarta-feira de Cinzas, Sexta-feira Santa e Corpus Christi). at ai j temos 12 feriados para todo o Brasil, mas ainda tem os feriados estaduais e municipais.

Os estados com nenhum feriado estadual so ES e GO e o estado com mais  o AC com 5, com 45 feriados em todos os estados e uma mdia de 1.7 feriados por estado, vamos a 13 feriados.

Municpios podem declarar at 4 feriados municipais, e dependendo tambm do municpio no podem ter mais de 4 feriados em um ms, mas para fins estatsticos usemos este nmero mximo, j que no dado anterior usamos a mdia.

A soma fica 12 feriados nacionais (entre fixos e mveis), 1.7 feriados estaduais e 4 feriados municipais o que chega a 17 feriados anuais por cidade. Destes 17 feriados existe a chance de aproximadamente 30% deles carem ou na tera ou na quinta e acontece de alguns estabelecimentos, principalmente os de administrao pblica de "enforcar" as segundas anteriores ou sextas posteriores, considerando a raridade do evento, coloquemos 2 dias enforcados. Chegando a um total de 19 datas que seriam consideradas de repouso.

Podemos ver, ento, [aqui](http://www.infomoney.com.br/minhas-financas/turismo/noticia/3574024/paises-com-mais-feriados-mundo) que o Brasil passaria de 12 feriados para 19, em primeiro lugar.

Eu, particularmente, acho que o Brasil tem feriados demais, dependendo do estado, ou mesmo do municpio, que voc more, tm feriados que realmente no condizem com o total da populao, mas com apenas uma parte, no que esta parte no seja importante, mas haveria mesmo a necessidade de um feriado municipal ou estadual para tal? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eu expliquei que as matrias 6h so de matrias com 4h semanais, logo 15 semanas. Este semestre, por exemplo teremos 2 feriados na sexta, 1 na segunda e 1 na quinta; no prximo 3 na quinta, 2 na sexta (na verdade sero enforcadas), 2 na quarta e 1 na segunda. O segundo semestre  mais compreensvel, j o primeiro, no.

Pensei na possibilidade de que nas 60h/30h eles no cobrassem os "dias perdidos por realizao das provas", mas como avaliaes so obrigatrias dentro do regulamento das universidades, para mim,  bvio que elas devam fazer parte das 60h/30h. </TEXT>
