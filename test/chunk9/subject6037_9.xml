Doesn't she tell Alicia she was working two jobs?

That's my recollection as well. It's either stated in the pilot or one of the first few episodes. Of course Peter may have used that as an excuse to fire Kalinda but the actual reason may have been different (he wanted to get rid of her after sleeping with her). </TEXT>

I do like Lucca though.

I think my problem with Lucca is that they haven't really given her a backstory. As I result I don't know what her motivations are. I liked her when she was working with Alicia in the bond court. But they really haven't given the character that much depth.

	<TITLE> Loved TGW, not feeling it for TGF. Anyone else? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-28 03:46:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was a big fan of "The Good Wife". Season 5 was probably the best ever produced by a network television show. I'm having trouble getting into "The Good Fight". I think they're trying too hard by leaning on the good parts of TGW (basic scenario, characters and plot development) without being unique enough or in a way that interests me.

I thought it was fine to start the show with Diane's life in shambles similar to Alicia in TGW. I'm not sure what "value added" the Maia storyline has brought with her life also in a very bad place and in a high profile way. Seven episodes in and are we now supposed to assume Diane is basically on the road to (financial) recovery? Is Maia now the "new" Alicia with her family problems crossing over to her both her personal and work life, just when she's trying to get her career started?

In TGW I liked that Alicia's efforts to put her life back together by returning to work meant having a rivalry with Cary and having somewhat of an ally with Josh and with help from Diane. I don't see this with Maia. In fact, I think her work situation is almost too gloomy and I see little hope for her forming any bonds at her new firm outside of Diane.

In TGW I thought Kalinda was fascinating and her relationship with Alicia was interesting to watch (before that went crap...). I didn't really care for the storylines with Peter or their children but I don't think they distracted from the show too much. The comedic element of Eli's character was great as were some of the quirks of the lawyers at the firm. 

I was never a fan of Lucca. I thought she was a cheap attempt to replace Kalinda and don't really like her in TGF. To me the character doesn't bring anything to the table in either TGW or TGF. The actress is great. I just don't like the character.

I don't feel the new part of TGF (the minority firm, which is basically a re-working of the all women's firm from TGW that failed), the reliance on some of the fun "gimmicks" from TGW - the judges, Elsbeth, Chumhum are very effective, Marisa is ok but not really relevant enough.

Anyone else having similar thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought the reenactment parts were well done. I can't speak to the accuracy of what was presented as I'm not an expert in that subject matter. 

The segments that were used to further the narrative were fine when they used an academic but less credible when using people from the entertainment industry. In other words I'm more interested in hearing from the U of T professor than some actor even if the dialogue is scripted. But I guess they used entertainers for the recognition factor. 

I liked it enough to continue to watch. I think as it moves forward to time periods I'm familiar with it will be more enjoyable. </TEXT>

How is crave?

I cancelled after a few months. It's great if you haven't seen any of HBO or Showtime shows as it carries almost all of their back catalog. I've subscribed to The Movie Network for years so I'd seen everything I wanted to watch from those cable channels.

Crave has some original content like Letterkenny (recommend if you've got an offbeat sense of humour) and some filler crap. Mostly TV stuff like documentaries, standup comedy shows, things like that. Not enough to keep me interested though. </TEXT>

i just started the first episode. is this a the wire-y kind of show? 

In my opinion no. It's a show about a bunch of cops at one precinct in Montreal. There's a bit of backstory/home life provided for most of the characters. 

Unlike "The Wire" the show doesn't touch on the broader social issues within the city nor does it take any viewpoint other than the police (and some of their family members). </TEXT>

great info ... but your link goes to an online database 

Thanks. But the link I created went directly to the entry of the book on Michael Power by  Mark McGowan, when I created it. Or at least it did when I set up earlier today and when I re-entered it right now. 

So I just changed it to the URL that is generated when you click on the tweet option (http://www.virtualreferencelibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM430672 amp;R=430672), which was the exact same one that I used earlier. 

If these URLs eventually redirect to an online database then perhaps there's something wrong with how they are being generated? Do they expire? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually that statue of the Piet and the plaque is also in honour of Michael Power, first Catholic Bishop in Toronto and a very important figure in the events of the summer of 1847. 

In the previous year Power was travelling through Ireland and gained a sense of the impending famine. He wrote letters warning of the potential immigration wave and was instrumental in dealing with the bureaucracy of the Toronto city council that summer.  Without his efforts the plight of the Irish immigrants would have been much worse. 

Quoted on the plaque on the Piet, "The Right Reverend Michael Power D D first bishop of the diocese of Toronto who laid down his life for fever sicken members of his flock this monument is devoutly dedicated". Michael Power is buried in a crypt below the altar in St. Michael's Cathedral on Bond Street. 

A book on Michael Power's life was published by U of T scholar Mark McGowan:

* [Michael Power : the struggle to build the Catholic Church on the Canadian frontier] (http://www.virtualreferencelibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM430672 R=430672)

You'd be amazed at how many torontonians absolutely hate the new addition to the building. 

We hate it not only because it's visually unappealing but it's also created a lot of unusable space inside.

Quoted from article:

"They may also experience gynecomastia (development of larger than normal mammary glands in males) as seen in Alan Turing's case"

I don't consider developing breasts as "minimal".

Also I don't believe he committed suicide. That's just a narrative of convince (looked good at the time, helped avoid any praise he might have been entitled to) to avoid was really happened. It may have been an accident. It may have been murder (by a trick). We'll likely never know. 

The point is the guy was a genius, made a significant if not crucial contribution to the war effort and was vilified for being gay.

Why is it that so many episodes recently only have a couple? That's lame.

Bottle episodes are usually cheaper/faster as they can take place with a sub-set of the cast and are often in one location so no repeated set-ups or transportation. 

In the case of the last episode the cast was minimal so everyone else got a bit of a break but it was shot in different locations so more work on that end.

	<TEXT> I'm guessing that over time the writers, perhaps intentionally, started to write fewer clinically-based storylines because they're harder to write, require consultation with experts, take longer to shoot and are more expensive to create (not that the show is hurting for money). 

Once they realized this shift wasn't really hurting the ratings they're going to stick with it. I'd imagine original/long term cast members would appreciate any reduction in complex dialogue they needed to memorize and intricate procedures they'd have to perform as I'm sure it makes their day much easier and shorter.

	<TEXT> UofT as an institution I feel should also be recognized for its contributions to research. I'm not trying to take away what Banting did but he is certainly part of what makes UofT's history so prestigious in Canada.

There was a lot of controversy regarding the awarding of the Nobel for the discovery of insulin. Department head J. J. R.Macleod was named along with Banting. Best should have been the co-recipient along with Collip, who helped refine the final insulin product. Banting gave half his prize money to Best.

From what I understand when Banting and Best (and I think Collip) were subsequently awarded the patent on insulin and they sold it to U of T for one dollar. Banting established Connaught Laboratories to help with the production of insulin. Profits were used to fund research (now known as the Connaught New Researcher Award). Banting believed that scientists should not waste time applying for funding to support research and hoped that the Connaught Laboratories profits would offset this need. He bequeathed the lab to U of T to support this in perpetuity. U of T later sold Connaught ending all funding except for the aforementioned New Researcher award. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Howard's salary likely comes from what is known as "soft funding", that is its dependent upon whatever grant money PIs (who must have a PhD to hold these grants) pull in. It may fluctuate as a result.

Based on what I know I'd say the salaries listed below for pharma reps they are an underestimation (more like $200K and up with bonuses)

"According to the 2016 Pharmaceutical Sales Salary Report, the average pharmaceutical sales salary is $122,107 (Median Total $115,000). Perhaps due to the increased complexity of the product, specialty pharma reps earn significantly more. The average specialty pharma sales salary is $138,150 (Median Total $125,000)"

Edit to add some R amp;D pharma salaries (and fixed typo)

http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Industry=Pharmaceutical_Research_and_Development/Salary

I think Bernadette would likely be a senior research scientist so around $100K. I think this is an underestimation as well. </TEXT>

Odd. I thought usually the u.s. and Canada were treated as one market.

Sadly no. In Canada we receive a varying degree of what's available in the US. 

In terms of network TV we have access to all the major channels and most large film releases in our theatres but when it comes to specialty channels or streaming services we either don't have access or we don't get the same shows. 

It all boils down to licensing agreements. 

Some times I'll see a show advertised in a commercial on the History Channel or National Geographic but it doesn't air in our version of these channels in Canada.

Netflix Canada has next to nothing available in terms of content as compared to the US version. We don't have access to Hulu and the version of Amazon Prime that was just made available in December 2016 here also has a poor selection compared to what's available in the US.

Occasionally the reverse happens and we get something like, "Certain Women" beforehand but it depends on the distributor and the agreements they've made.

If you scroll down on this link of the theatre release dates for, "Personal Shopper" you'll see Canada lags behind the States.
