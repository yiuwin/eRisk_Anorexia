	<TEXT> Reposting for more exposure...

The reports came out that an Asian woman wanted to  rent a room in someone's house and when she asked about more people coming the owner said it was ok.   Then when they were about to arrive, the women "Tami" cited they couldn't stay there because "one word, Asian" also citing "That's why we have Trump". 

Let me preface this by saying this is in CA, a couple hours from LA.....

1. The Airbnb host probably had an idea that this woman was Asian to begin with when she agreed to let her stay.  Her name is Dyne Suh...Suh being a predominately Korean name. The woman "Tami" had agreed upon two people (and 2 dogs) staying in a room for $50 a night.

2.  Suh asked about two more people staying in the room.  "Tami" agreed and said this was fine.  Suh offered to pay more in exchange for two more people staying in the room.  Now Tami has again agreed to let them stay in her house.  Now it is 4 people and 2 dogs for $50/night.

3.  Suh and her group were 3 minutes from their destination when all of the sudden "Tami" decided they couldn't stay at her house.  "Tami" has not seen or spoken to Suh and the group in person.  Why all the sudden is Suh's race an issue?  This is starting to seem fishy.... there is more...

4.  Airbnb has been seeing an increased number of allegations of people renting less to minorities.  [In response to a rising number of allegations that hosts were refusing certain guests because of their race, the company launched a three-month review last year that "generally confirmed public reports that minorities struggle more than others to book a listing."](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-airbnb-discrimination-20170407-story.html).  So **last year** they started a three-month review looking into this.

I looked for this 90-day review and surprise surprise I could not find it.  There is a plethora of articles that talks about Airbnb's plan to do a [90-day "minority review"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelbycarpenter/2016/06/22/airbnb-speaks-out-on-fairness-to-black-travelers-details-90-day-company-wide-review/#2d58953a47b8) and another stating that [Airbnb is scheduled to meet with civil rights leaders in Washington, D.C., this week, to seek ideas on how the popular home-sharing service can combat discrimination.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/06/22/airbnb-civil-rights-groups-washington/86210508/).  [Chris Lehane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lehane) who is Airbnb's head of global policy called [Laura Murphy](http://www.lwmurphy.com/about.html) the civil rights advocate to look into the matter.  

Let's take a closer look at Chris Lehane....

...In 1992, Lehane was the political director of the **Clinton-Gore presidential campaign** in Maine

Christopher Stephen "Chris" Lehane (born June 2, 1967) is an American political consultant and crisis communications expert who has served as a lawyer, spokesperson and expert in opposition research for **the Clinton White House.**.....

...In 1995 Lehane authored a 332-page memo on a media "conspiracy" against the Clintons, of which only 2 and a half pages are written text; the remainder being newspaper and internet clippings. This report was the origin of the phrase **"vast right-wing conspiracy" that is often attributed to Hillary Clinton.**

...In 2007, Lehane helped create the Lincoln Brigade, an organization that defeated a Republican sponsored ballot initiative designed to change how California divides up its Electoral College votes.

So Lehane has a strong connection to the Clintons.  Let's move on.

The only speculation I can gather from Laura Murphy is that she is well respected among her peers and worked extensively with the Bush jr. and Obama administrations.  She is a civil rights activist which made her a good candidate for helping with this "report".

-I struggled to find anything about Airbnb's 90-day report.  It is not on their website nor is any result or action on Murphy's website.  You would think if the most popular room rental site had you do a investigation in the area of your expertise, you would advertise it.  **All of the articles that I found about the "upcoming review" were between June and September last year....right before the election".**

-I am sure you are all SHOCKED to know that [Airbnb endorsed Hillary Clinton last year for president](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/284644-netflix-airbnb-chief-execs-endorse-clinton).  Funny that they endorse Hillary Clinton in June, the same time that they first mentioned their review....

-Fast forward a couple months.  Here is where it starts getting weird.  [This is the video that just went viral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuZn8iVQbSc).  Note that this incident apparently took [place over President's Day](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-airbnb-discrimination-20170407-story.html).  This story just went viral....three days ago.  

Lets watch the youtube video shall we?  The video starts out with the friends and the group putting chains on their tires to combat the snow.  This was recorded presumably when it was happening by one of the members in the group.  At :13 she is being interviewed WITH PROFESSIONAL LIGHTING AND CAMERA EQUIPMENT.  So either they had professional camera equipment in the car and they decided to whip it out and start an interview, they called the media who went out during a blizzard to interview this woman and hold the story for 2 months to put out, they did the interview 2 months later and waited to put this woman in a blizzard to achieve some kind of dramatic effect, or this is all bullshit.   I call the last. (The smeared eyeliner is a nice touch).  The video goes back and forth between the shitty self-recorded cellphone video and the professionally recorded interview.

-So why would Airbnb do this?  Well first they never did their "minority report".  They paid Laura Murphy to do some groundwork for the Clinton campaign. They probably got some backlash internally for not doing this report before the election so they decided to make it seem like Trump started this racism on Airbnb.  It is the perfect way to scapegoat Trump, save face, and pay off their friend Laura Murphy.  

Please feel free to dig deeper into this.  I feel like they are trying to pull one over on us.  Don't stop the fight centipedes!

	<TEXT> Essentially Jimmy Carter banned Iranian immigrants after he royally fucked up the hostage negotiation. It was a total 'fuck you' to the Iranian government. Iranian students were thrown out of the U.S., travel was stopped, visas were denied,the whole 9 yards. It wasn't based in any reasoning besides the fact that he got manipulated and wanted retaliation.

Obamas I am a little fuzzier with. Not sure it was so much of a "ban" but a cease in visa processing for incoming Iraqis. 

I'm on mobile so I can't link proper articles, especially ones that are free from bias.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone.... I'm seriously enjoying BF1 with my friends right now and I think the game is in a good place, but could use some tweaks. We like being in vehicles together because the communication is great for them. However, it seems like other people on our team not in our squad get spawning priority over in-squad members. I also was watching a YouTube video and the guy said to spawn in your friends vehicle earlier you need to leave the squad. Can someone help clear this up for me. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Later in the debate, he spoke again of how he was going to help the African Americans, who lived in inner cities, suffering from high poverty rates, bad educational systems, and no jobs.

He said he wants to help African Americans that specifically suffer from high poverty rates, bad educational systems, and don't have jobs. Nowhere in this article did he state that all African Americans in inner cities are poor. 

If you can read take a look at this poverty map.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/research/u-s-concentrated-poverty-in-the-wake-of-the-great-recession/amp/

Poverty is concentrated in the inner cities. This study by PBS states that 70% of blacks and Latinos live in inner cities http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-03-08.htm

Even if your claim is true that he thinks all African Americans are in poverty. It's a misinterpretation of census and race data. How does that support your claim that he "dislikes black rights". I'm not seeing your correlation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are conflating the RIGHT to education, well paying jobs, healthcare etc. There is a huge problem with designating these as "rights". The United States government is then REQUIRED to give you those rights. 

Let's just go through some examples.

You have a RIGHT to healthcare. You get the flu and have to get treatment. Your local government doctor is closed after 5pm. You sue the government because your "right" to healthcare wasn't fulfilled, and win. 

You have the RIGHT to a well-paying job. Well the economy is booming, employment is 100%... Then the stock market crashes. People lose jobs, businesses, families get divorced. You need a job, but the economy doesn't have enough jobs to provide for everyone. You sue the government because you have a right to a fair-paying job, and win.

You don't study in school. You get lousy grades and you don't pay attention. Government run colleges HAVE TO ACCEPT YOU no matter what. You take out a loan for 200k and take 8 years to get your degree.  You can't get a job because you are unmotivated and lazy and can never pay those loans back. 

You honestly can't see how guaranteeing people impossible rights would be a problem? There's no possible way to guarantee every single person in the United States these things. If you didn't provide one of those things then people could sue the government left and right and they would win. The people would have to be taxed a ton to pay all these lawsuits. It's just unreasonable.
