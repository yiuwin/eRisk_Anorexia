	<TEXT> Suicidal thoughts are scary. I wish I could say that things are going to be great and that you are going through a rough patch, but I always hated getting those talks when I was feeling suicidal. It just made me feel worse for not believing them that I was somehow "just going through a bad time"

	<TEXT> Thanks for posting. Alcohol was a quick fix and helped me dissociate from my mental health problems. In the end, alcohol ended up making ALL my symptoms worse. 

I found that recovering from substance abuse and mental health problems was really challenging on my own. I opted to get support from peers and professionals. It's been a good mix for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a lot of fun in treatment. I was told to stick with the winners (the ones doing the work and serious about sobriety) and to leave all my shit there. I left a ton of mental baggage there. I told things to strangers I promised I would never tell anyone. It was HUGELY liberating.

There are people there who want to be there, who are forced to be there and who aren't sure if they want to be there. I realized early on that I could either be a "badass" who tried to fuck the rules and be defiant...or I could actually use my time there and learn something. I chose to learn something and drop my shitty attitude. I haven't drank since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I start by expressing the feelings I am having. Sometimes writing it down helps. 

During my sobriety I've gone through periods where I can help myself (using meditation, exercise, self-care, talking to peers etc)...but then there have been a couple times where I really was at the end of my rope. The level of suffering and pain I was in was NO match for a walk in the woods or a coffee with a friend. It's time like those I realize like "Whoa, Vic, something is UP and you're not gonna drag yourself out of this one"

There have been a few times within the last year where I was in so much mental pain and anguish that I just cried and cried and cried. It seemed like life was never going to get better.

So really, sometimes I can use the faculties and resources I've built...and other times I need to rely on professionals giving guidance and providing support. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I quit when I was 25. I was a bonified substance abuser and dependent on alcohol when I was 22.

In early recovery, I stuck to sober people and sober places. It wasn't boring because I was committed to attaining a new lifestyle and wasn't romanticizing the "bar life" that many people had.

I met people through AA, group therapy, and volunteering with sober organizations. I also made a lot of friends at the gym. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I couldn't stop myself from counting days, so I went with it.

I find it super helpful and interesting to count days. 

From 0-30 it felt like I could easily "get that time back" but my first try at sobriety I was in rehab and didn't want to fuck up, so I had no chance of relapsing.

31-60 days my sobriety felt more like, wow, it would take me TWO MONTHS to get back to where I am today. Might as well stay sober.

Up until 6 months I felt the same way.

After 6 months I was hit with a huge dilemma: I decided I needed to commit to long term sobriety. I realized I didn't have the resources to get this time back. Half a year is a long time.

Disclaimer: this is how my self-talk works. I worked quite hard through outpatient therapy and counselling to stop myself from self-sabotaging. I found that counting days until one year was really useful. Now I'll celebrate big milestones, like 2500 days...I'll bake a cake or something.

	<TEXT> Day counting doesn't work for some people for this reason. For me it was important to count days, because the motivation to see the increasing numbers put me in the anxiety sweet spot: not too much anxiety, and not a state of zero anxiety.  </TEXT>

I had to get into recovery by my own volition.

That being said, I was pushed a little and it did help. Should couples push each other? That's up to you and the relationship dynamic. We cannot tell you what to do here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many people have unhappy home lives, not everyone reaches for a bottle. Drinking was a choice I made to deal with life.

I found that when I got sober, I started to notice more of the family dynamics that were going on. 

My husband didn't watch me go through active addiction, but we have issues like most couples. What really helped me was learning about our 'language of love'

For example, my husband doesn't show his love for me through flowery poetry or gifts. But I never have to put gas in the car, and he loves making the home safe and comfortable for me. His language of love is acts of service. I didn't realize he was basically saying "I love you" when the car was safe, the home was clean and the roof was mended.

To overcome some of our communication issues, we've had to sit down and actually talk about what we want from each other and how to navigate how we show affection.  </TEXT>

I say "No thanks" or "I'm good thanks"

I've only been asked once why I didn't drink, and I said that drinking doesn't agree with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just sharing my story. It's the only one I can share. I didn't mean to say that you should go to inpatient, it's definitely not for everyone. 

Outpatient services are actually recommended to most people before inpatient. I was lucky that I didn't have any bills to pay or a job to go to, so inpatient was an easy choice.

You have our support here in whatever you choose to do. Even if you slip up and drink, we'll still be there. That's what we're here for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So scary eh? I was terrified. Like, what the fuck do non-drinkers do with all that time on weekends?

I approached it with levity and humour. I remember when I got out of rehab I was sitting around on a Friday night with my parents, watching Game of Thrones, thinking, "Is this my life now?"

The biggest thing I learned was that there is nothing wrong with being bored. Like, I don't have to be constantly entertained all the time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me I needed to really give myself some time and space to get better. I wasn't well enough to use outpatient services or just a support group. My body and mind were deeply entrenched in alcohol and I needed to remove myself from the insanity of my environment and commit to learning how to take care of myself.

My journey is that I went to rehab for 35 nights and then slowly introduced myself back into the world of the living. 

That being said, we all have different paths. My doctor helped me navigate the addicition treatment system and together with an addiction counsellor, we created a "treatment plan." It helped me feel focused.

	<TEXT> I was scared of relapsing too. So scared that I did SO much work on myself. So scared that I structured my entire world around being sober. Career, husband, friends, home. It all depends on my sobriety. So I created a sober network to keep me honest.

I also was told that the odds of me staying sober after a year out of rehab were less than 5%.

But telling an alcoholic that she's going to relapse had the same effect of telling me that I wasn't allowed to drink. For once my stubbornness worked for me. I stayed sober and beat the odds.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find people are quick to judge other people's sobriety, and less quick to have an actual conversation with someone about what they are struggling with and how sobriety has been hard.

There's this notion out there that recovery has to look "happy." But sometimes recovery is hard, and people have deep seated patterns that continue to follow them when they get sober. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was on one medication, Effexor, for a long time to help me "come out" of my anorexia. I actually developed "antidepressant induced mania" and thought that was what normal people felt like. I wasn't tolerating the drug well, but because I wasn't following up with my psychiatrist, I kept taking it.

I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I had had the insight you showed and asked for a second opinion AND done my part of the job in therapy: show up and be honest.

Once I got sober, I finally decided enough was enough. My addiction doctor in rehab set me up on a new medication regiment and I felt worse at first, and then better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole time reading through your post I thought to myself "That's quite a bit of insight and fantastic coping skills"

I've had a few cravings in recovery and they scare me. Because I feel like "well shit, I shouldn't be having cravings, *I am in recovery goddammit*"

In my experience, I get cravings when faced with difficult times (moving to Toronto away from my husband for a year) where I feel like my regular coping skills are going to be challenged.

It's like the old Victoria drinking brain kicks in and goes "HEY REMEMBER WHEN YOU USED TO DRINK THROUGH EVERYTHING, HEY REMEMBER THAT?"

So I deal with it by going "Yeah I do remember. Thanks. Now, fuck off"

For me when I write and talk about cravings, it reshines the light back onto the addiction. It exposes cravings for what they are in my mind: a very overvalued thought. </TEXT>
