	<TEXT> You DO NOT talk this stuff to officals. They are all Erdogan's men, either appointed because they are his loyals anyway, or bribed to be his loyals. They won't do stalinist stuff (yet) but they can sue you for stupid reasons and get you in jail. Same with police, they can arrest for their reasons as well. And be careful not to talk to any of his supporters too, they might get angry (unless you got some dudes backing lol).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe the pride is the very thing that is taking this country down. We are always taught about our great achievements in the past, and people just think of them as good old days when everything was good, leading to the back-minded state of thought which most of the turks are like. Because old turkic empires were always larger and very powerful, they believe going back to the old beliefs will make them great again.

So I just think this is all about education. You teach your children about how to make his country better, not about how his country was the greatest and still is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mustafa Kemal was the best thing to happen to Turkey for a long time, but I still think he was a bit relaxed on the ultra-religious people. He did shut down many of their places, but ultimately you have to jail (or kill) most of their skeleton crew to put an end. Or these religious groups go on forever and get more and more brainwashy soldiers under their control, suicide bombings of our day evidence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am turkish and this guy's a bad guy.

This country would be much better without religion. It would be better if we could just get rid of it as a whole, its not an old concept for us anyway. Nomads dont have (organized) religion. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is it possible to limit your vassal powers as time goes ? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> In real life, many european states were able to limit their vassals' powers to thr point the King was absolute ruler (Philippe IV the Fair seems to be a Good example.) In this game, vassals just seem to be able to revolt when they are unhappy, regardless of time and absolute crown laws don't seem to help it much (though they are supposed to limit vassals to a great extent and place more importance on bureucracy). Is there a way to progress your realm towards a more centralized state ?
