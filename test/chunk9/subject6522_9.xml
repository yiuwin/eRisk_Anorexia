	<TEXT> Same here. Lotus Flower was the only thing I've been listening from the album but later I found myself enjoying Morning Mr Magpie as well. Personal life is also pretty shit right now so a few weeks ago I gave the album another listen. Codex and Give Up The Ghost finally clicked on me but the real moment was when Separator came up. The melancholic piano and Thom's beautiful voice really connected to me. It felt like the whole album was finally making sense to me. Radiohead have done it again.  </TEXT>
