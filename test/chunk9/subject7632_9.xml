	<TEXT> It was technically a "holiday" event. Not a Christmas event. We all know that Christmas is more globally well known, but I think Niantic tries to be impartial with regards to religion etc.

That said, I wouldn't mind at all if they had most holiday events. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Discussion] If there was a real holiday or event that could promote regional Pokmon being shared globally, what might it be? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I saw many posts about whether we'll ever get to see Pokmon from other regions, but I haven't seen an actual decent idea of HOW or WHEN or WHY these Pokmon would be shared across the globe.

Can anyone think of a relevant holiday, event, tradition, etc where it might actually make sense for Niantic to take advantage of it?

It would be cool if Niantic was to allow regionals to spawn everywhere for that one event. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just can't believe that so many people are still jumping on this whole race bandwagon without any understanding or feeling towards anyone else. I don't care who's in charge or what race they are, as long as they attempt to treat everyone fairly and stop corruption. Does nobody at the top have this opinion anymore?

As soon as someone is threatened or accused of something, it becomes racism. You know why? Because almost everyone in this fucking country gets distracted by that.

Instead of kicking someone out for being a corrupt, destructive asshole, we're worried about the specific things they say to another race group and focus on that. Then one group supporting white people stands against another group supporting black people and our asshole friends just disappear into the shadows until something happens next time and they pull the same stunt again.

How about we only focus on who has been helping our country and forget about anything to do with race right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a question I always had for ANY universe, let alone Harry Potter. 

Werewolves in most interpretations, for example, would kill and partially devour a sheep or something before turning back. Do we assume that the human now has 1kg of meat in his/her tummy?

Judging by the fact that Peter Pettigrew transforms into a rat, one 20th of his size (or something like that), I'd have to say that any external consumption is considered null and void during a transformation. A 10cm long rat couldn't possibly contain a 300g steak or something that Pettigrew might have eaten before transforming.  </TEXT>

I personally have seen and caught ONE Swinub.

Only ever seen and caught 2 Magnemite and only ever seen and caught 2 Voltorb.

Apart from events, the only reason I have Pikachu at all is because of two lucky hatches.

Only ever hatched one Jynx. And one Smoochum since they were released.

I've seen a handful of Dratini and a couple Dragonite so I won't complain there, except that I still don't have one good enough to use in battle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in two minds about this.

I agree with this for more than one reason:

1) Magikarp were found in most areas in the original games because you could fish in addition to walking around. (I'd love Niantic to add a fishing mini-game or some fishing-related action that results in finding a Magikarp)

2) Gyarados requires 400 candy and if you're like me and you don't have a water biome anywhere nearby, you probably only got a Gyarados in the event and then will never get one again.

3) As you said, there aren't any other Shinies so this would give people incentive to constantly look for Magikarp until they also have a shiny.

BUT the ONE problem and the only reason I disagree:

Everyone will eventually get a shiny Magikarp and it won't be worth as much. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Idea] BAM (Reference to the POW block from the Mario Brothers games) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-03 09:56:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The item should look exactly like [the POW block](http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ld7nircVyf1qzj5ggo1_1280.gif) from [the original Mario Brothers games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bros.), but it says BAM (or whatever someone thinks is better).

I got this idea from multiple people mentioning the beserk status on this subreddit.

So this item would be a chargeable item (let's say a 4-room charge) which would bounce the entire room with something along the lines of the iconic POW block sound, then it would inflict mass damage to all but the last enemy in the room. (If all enemies are the same or have the same amount of health, one enemy would be chosen at random to be the "last remaining enemy).

Upon killing each enemy with this item, there is a high chance of the enemy dropping a coin, however, the last enemy in the room turns into a fast champion version of itself. (Yellow champion?)

If this item is used in a room that only contains one enemy, that enemy becomes the fast champion version of itself.

ALTERNATE IDEA:

Instead of the item causing mass damage to enemies, it could have a high chance to flip enemies upside down for a short period of time. (Flipped enemies would be helpless to move or attack but can still cause contact damage if relevant)

Enemies would still have a high chance of dropping coins and the last enemy would still become a fast champion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of stuff in the original Pokmon games was all luck based. Don't forget that. Yes, Niantic's take on the game works quite differently, but that's how they wanted to do it. Unfortunately, it doesn't please everyone, but I personally am still having a blast with this game and I don't think I'll stop anytime soon.

I don't mind the "restrict shiny to specific trainer" thing, but as you said, I do wish we saw it on the map. Since the speed caps came into play, I barely get to spin any Pokstops to get items, and because of this, I only catch the Pokmon I want. But this means I won't know if the ones I avoid are shiny. In the future, should I click on every single Pokmon and then exit the screen, just to check if it's shiny? I hope they change this. I hope shiny spawns even make a different sound when they spawn. Maybe the normal noise with a sparkly sound as well.

The evolution items is also something I don't particularly get. I think they should have either increased the chance of finding these items but added ALL of them (Fire Stone, Moon Stone, etc) or remove the need for any evolution items at all.

Either way, we all want to get everything in the game, but with the luck and patience aspect, it becomes easy to get frustrated. I still have one left in my Gen 1 dex: Kabutops. But thanks to this last event, I finally got Dewgong and Gyarados. I'm sure you'll get everything you need soon :)

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would personally prefer if, instead of being a delivery quest, all these quests had a start point, but they end whenever you're done with the task.

E.g. 

* Find an NPC on the map.
* "Catch 5 Pokmon in the next 24 hours and I'll give you a prize!"
* Catch the 5 Pokmon
* NPC appears in front of you to give you the prize </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, if Pokmon Go doesn't let you create a home point etc, at the very least, it should record the most common Pokstop you swipe, then that should be the area it is likely to give quests when there's nothing in your current area or if you're too far from the original quest point.

Alternatively, you should just need to deliver parcels to 3 Pokstops or something. Then it won't be as much of an issue. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Bugs] Niantic, please fix the game-breaking bugs caused by bad connections or from clicking something too far away. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I live in South Africa and we're not exactly known for our internet connection here, so very often, I end up waiting so long for a gym or a Pokmon to load that by the time it actually does load, it either bugs out (like the tiny Pokmon encounter) or it just makes the UI disappear. Either way, forcing you to restart the app.

I know there's plenty of bugs, but this one has been around for a while now and it really messes up gameplay when you can't do anything until you restart, especially when you see something you want to catch.

I completely understand the fact that this probably only occurs during bad connections, but I'd much rather receive the "Error" red bar that I used to receive before.

TL;DR: I totally understand there's going to be errors in the game but please do more to handle the error instead of allowing it to break the game or the UI :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see your logic, but I don't think that any of this is related to trading at all.

It'll definitely be awesome to receive a shiny via trading. But it wouldn't be the reason for Niantic to implement trading.

Since we're talking about trading, I know people are saying that Niantic plans to do trading as a face-to-face thing for people that you previously agreed to meet, but I think it's completely unfair. Why would I only want to trade with people in my area? That defeats the purpose of having regional Pokmon etc.

I want all the regionals. This means, even with trading, either I or the person who's trading with me will need to travel a long distance.

Plus, being in Africa, I have no regional to bargain with yet. </TEXT>
