	<TEXT> The cashier says "Hello! What can I get you?"

The boy replies "Ummm...may I please have some Jelly Tip?"

"I'm sorry, but we ran out of Jelly Tip. Is there something else you would like? Maybe chocolate?" responds the cashier.

"No thanks. Could I have some Jelly Tip?" replies the boy.

Slightly annoyed, the cashier replies "I said, we *don't* have Jelly Tip."

The boy responds "In that case I'll have some Jelly Tip."

The cashier, clearly annoyed says "Look. You're a smart boy, right? Spell the 'Berry' in 'Strawberry'."

"B - E - R - R - Y" responds the boy.

"Good...now spell the 'Nill' in Vanilla'."

"N - I - L - L" says the boy. 

"Brilliant!" speaks the cashier. "Now spell the 'fuck' in 'Jelly Tip'."

Confused, the boy responds "There's no 'Fuck' in Jelly Tip?"

"Exactly! There's no fuckin Jelly Tip!!!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The "errors" and "contradictions" I see aren't contradictions or errors persay, but it isn't inspiring. For reference, a good way of describing how I feel is [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxc20saM8DA). I do understand it is meant as a comedy song, but it raises good points. Back to the "errors" bit, I just don't see how a massive flood kills EVERYONE but Inca and Aztec and Mayan records of the time exist, let alone don't record such an event. Besides, who the fuck would want to worship a being that commits mass genocide and forces incest among a family (Yup. In the bible it implies that Noah's family commited incest.) There's a lot more I could go into but in the end, you have to decide what you believe in and I don't wanna become the sterotypical Atheist among catholics/christians/whatever that shits on religion because I'm not like that. Just a word of advice, ask yourself questions. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions. That way, we can all come to our own conclusions. (Also don't become Ken Ham.) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Bloons TD Timeline </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-06 05:01:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, Reddit. Today I am going to do the seemingly impossible: Give the Bloons series a plausible timeline. For the purposes of this timeline, I will only be incorporating the Bloons TD series (As well as Bloons Monkey City, BTD Battles and MOBILE Bloons Super Monkey). At the end of this, I will be using my timeline to construct a plausible Bloons narrative that would seem satisfying, like Matpat does with his FNaF theories. I will warn you, that this theory *is* long, but I would say that this theory is worth a read. If you dont want to read it all, then scroll down to my story, which is heavily based off my proposed timeline andwellis my description of it. If you know the bloons universe inside out, I suggest skipping to the story. If not, stick around because before we begin piecing together the timeline, I would like to point out how my evidence works. I will be using maps, towers and updates (especially in the case of BTD Battles) to work out when each event takes place.

---

To start out, I believe that Bloons Tower Defence 1, reasonably, is the first in the timeline. This can be demonstrated that there are only 5 towers (Dart Monkey, Tack Shooter, Ice Tower, Bomb Tower and Super Monkey) and 1 map, with no available difficulty. Seems simple enough, right? 

---

Next in the series, as would be expected of ***most*** franchises (cough cough fnaf), comes Bloons Tower Defence 2, with its 3 maps, and 8 bloon types. While the previous game only had 1 map (and coincidentally 1 difficulty) and 6 bloons, (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Black and White) this game comes with 2 new enemies: Lead, and Rainbow. The Peanut Butter bloon is immune to sharp objects like a dart, or a tack (like theres anything else) and pops down into 2 black bloons and the Rainbow Bloon pops down into 2 Black Bloons and 2 White bloons. I believe it would be useful to note that this is the same amount of blacks/whites a Rainbow pops down into currently (disregarding the announcement of BTD6). On top of this, there is the addition of 1 tower (3 if you count the now infamous road spikes and lesser known Monkey Glue, to slow down bloons, and pop the ones that manage to sneak through) - The Boomerang Monkey. Not only are the monkeys now becoming diverse in their skills, but they also have extra weapons to make the bloons bend to their will. The bloons, essentially, are starting to be controlled by the monkeys! 

---

Bloons Tower Defence 3, is, as expected, a direct sequel to the second game, with 8 maps, 3 difficulties independent from the tracks and 8 or 11 towers, depending on how you look at things. Aside from the old favourites from the second game, as well as the exploding pineapple, a road tower that explodes 3 seconds after placing, the spike-o-pult and the monkey beacon  the first support tower (tower that doesnt attack). This game also introduces the Ceramic Bloon, and the infamous MOAB (Massive Ordinary Air Blimp). The MOAB is the first bloon in the MOAB class, 3 more to appear in later games. Another reason is the upgrading system, while in previous games there were 2 upgrades, each on a separate path (you could get any upgrade at any time, assuming you had the funds), now there were 4 upgrades on 2 paths. This meant that you had to get 1 upgrade before you got the next one on that path. This paved the way for the bloons to become exceedingly diverse and required the monkeys to make some major changes. 

---

In BTD4, there are 16 maps. 9 of them are regular and the other 7 are premium  you need to pay in the websites currency known as NK Coins. This game also introduces a TON of upgrades and towers, as well as 3 new bloon types. Sadly, for the spike-o-pult, the tower no longer exists, instead being merged with the dart monkey. We can infer that this game then comes after the games that the spike-o-pult is its own tower. On top of this, the upgrade system is different, again, in the fact that there is only 1 path, with the 4th upgrade requiring a special rank to unlock. Ranks are unlocked through popping bloons, 1 bloon translates to 1 experience point, and these ranking systems are what allows the towers to unlock, which, again, plays into the timeline. So the new towers that were added influence the timeline MAJORLY. If these towers werent in it, then my theoretical timeline (and story) would be way, *WAY* more different. First off, we have the Mortar Monkey, which you can aim exactly where the explosion will hit, with some variation. Its third tier (which is useful for BTD5 and beyond) is Bloon Buster. I am noting this upgrade in particular because it can pop through 2 layers of bloons, while doing grouped damage. For example, it could pop a blue bloon down to nothing, while at the same time, cant pop two red bloons if one of those reds were outside of the explosion range. On the other hand, a Dart Monkey with Sharp Shots could pop two reds, even if one of them was outside the range of the DM, while it cant pop a blue bloon down to nothing with one shot. Glue gunners shoot monkey glue, which is a road item you could place down that featured in the previous instalment, now automatically shot as well as being able to be manually placed down. The Monkey Ace is the only moving tower in the game, implying that monkeys can make towers the can move and have cities (further reinforced by the maps Firecracker and Subterranean Sewers). The other towers are the Monkey Buccaneer, the only water tower, the Monkey Apprentice, also known as the Wizard, who can summon spells in conjunction with his previous spells and the Banana Farm, which ties the entire theory together. The farm gives extra cash at the end of each round and is exceedingly more useful when it is purchased earlier on. There is also the now infamous but sadly underused exploding pineapple, that adds the key mechanic of blowing up after 3 seconds. The pineapple description states Like all healthy food, pineapples explode shortly after being placed. This implies that bananas are also meant to explode. This may very well be some monkey business, though.

New bloons introduced here are the Zebra Bloon, immune to BOTH explosions and freezing, and pops to reveal 1 black and 1 white bloon, also 2 zebras are revealed instead of 2 blacks and 2 whites from a rainbowthe pink bloon, which pops down into yellows, and is slightly faster than the white, making it the fastest bloon in the game. The white and blacks now pop down into 2 pinks instead of Yellows, and the now infamous Camo (or camouflage bloon) that can only be targeted by towers that can see it, most camo detecting upgrades also grant that power to nearby towers. Its worth noting for the narrative that the towers can pop, but not target them. The final bloon added to the game is the INFAMOUS BFB  Brutal Flying Behemoth. This puppy contains 4 MOABs, each containing 4 ceramics each containing 2 rainbowsJust do the math. Thats an RBE of 1,525!!! (Look up RBE  Bloons to find out what it is, I cant explain it. Too high of a word count as-is.) In the expansion pack, taking place right after the main game (and incidentally the first bloons td game I played) there is the introduction of 2 towers, and 4 maps, the others being lost to time. Or the bloons. The 2 towers are the Dartling Gun, a Gatling Gun, except with darts, and the Spike Factory, which automatically places down Road Spikes randomly within its range. One map, however is what solidifies the absolute place in the timeline, and is why I even thought of this theory in the first place. The advanced track, known as Monkey Temple is hinted at having supreme powers in the game. We know this due to the blurb text at the bottom of the screen being a bit too unsubtle for notice. The advanced track in this expansion pack holds a strange secret. This, of course, sent the internet into a frenzy and soon enough people figured out that if you have 40 towers on the screen and $30,000 then a notification would pop up saying Do you want to activate the Monkey Temple? The temple will take a sacrifice of 40 towers and 30000 money. You will not be given a second chance. Why is this important? (Imagine Austin screaming) WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT!?!?! ILL TELL YOU WHY!!! IT LINKS TOGETHER THE ENTIRE BLOONS UNIVERSE!!!! ALL OF BTD5, BLOONS MONKEY CITY AND BTD BATTLES HINGE ON THIS ONE MOMENT!!! Now that thats out of the way, lets go to the next game in the series. 

---

Bloons Super Monkey has similar graphics to BTD4, but the gameplay is miles different. You control the super monkey, who must pop certain amounts of bloons, and a boss if necessary. You accomplish this by upgrading your monkey using blops, dropped by popped bloons. This explains how you earn cash in the BTD series. That is pretty much it. The second, and most recent bloons game, however  Bloons Super Monkey 2  holds the answers to even more mysteries. It explains the origins of the Radadactyl, a special agent in the next game in the timeline (yes, we are moving away from the traditional next game is a sequel format and delving into FNaF timeline structure.) It also explains why MOABs, BFBs and another MOAB class I will reveal the name  or acronym  of later. It also explains how the ice monkey is now so powerful, while in previous games, it was rarely ever used, it is now a key part of the BTD meta. 

---

Next in the timeline is NOT BTD5. Well, it is, but its BTD5 Deluxe. Yea. Didnt think that game would be a key part of this, did you? Think again! BTD5 (and in a wider range, deluxe) introduces 2 new towers (4 if you count deluxe and the removal of the monkey glue) with a name change to the Monkey Beacon. It is now the Monkey Village. This is a crucial step in the civilisation of the game, as now not only farms are on the battlefield, but towns! (Which is an actual upgrade). Deluxe is placed here though, not due to its agents, or its maps (although the maps play a huge part in the timeline) but the 2 exclusive (my ass) towers, the Bloonchipper and the Monkey Engineer. These guys disappearance in BTD5 is explained later, so I will cover that. The other 2 towers are the Ninja Monkey, and the Sniper Monkey. The Ninja can see camo bloons by default (more on those tweaks later) and throws a shuriken. Upgrades (which I will also talk about later) include Seeking Shuriken, Distraction, Bloonjitsu and Flash Bomb. The Sniper, on the other hand, is a tower with infinite  Yes, you heard me right  INFINITE range, with a small range patch around it which can be useful in some situationsnot this game though. It pops through 2 layers of bloon (like the bloon buster) when un-upgraded and can pop up to 18!! Thats enough for a whole ceramic to be destroyed! (Note that it pops down layers, not bloons themselves) Un-upgraded, a rainbow will pop down to 2 blacks and 2 whites. Yes. Like in BTD2 and 3.) Upgrades include Night Vision Goggles (Allows it to see camo), Semi-Automatic Rifle, and CRIPPLE MOAB. These towers shaped the rest of the bloons series. Another reason, (and oh boy! Its a biggie!) that its placed here is due to the maps. Look at the map titled Ocean Roadseem familiar? It should because its present in BTD4! Other BTD4 tracks in this game are Military Base, Pool Table and Railway Track, the latter being one of the aforementioned premium tracks from BTD4. BTD5 also introduces the Zeppelin of Mighty Gargantuaness (yes, thats how its spelled) AKA the ZOMG Pronounced either zom g or Zoh My God! (The former being how you would expect to pronounce it; the latter being made popular by bloons YouTuber Superjombombo.) This is what I was referencing in the Bloons Super Monkey Section. This bloon contains 4 BFBs so contains an RBE of 6,101!!!!! THATS INSANE!!! On top of that MOAB class, the camo bloons got a rework. Instead of a camo bloon popping into a couple of pinks, any bloon can be camo, and all bloons inside will be camo. E.G, a camo rainbow spawns, and when, say, a ninja pops it, then it will split into 2 camo zebras, then a camo black and white each and so on. Regrow bloons, however, are identified by their heart shape and if not popped quickly enough will Regrow one layer up to the spawning layer. These bloons are dangerous as if you had a summon whirlwind monkey apprentice blow backsayregen rainbows, the rainbows would pop down to blacks, whites and zebras, but EACH zebra would regrow into a rainbow and EACH black would regrow to a zebra and EACH white. These bloons, when popped will split into MORE bloons. On the upside, if you had a good enough defence, then you can make infinite cash and EXP off of it. On the downside, if you didnt have enough defences, then you would quickly get overrun and lose. When combined, these 2 effects can be disastrous. Just imagine you dedicating all your towers to MOAB class popping power and then a whole bunch of camgrow (the nickname for both) ceramics to bust through your defences, multiplying due to your apprentices.

 Next on the list is BTD5 Steam, where maps are lost, but towers are not. We even get introduced to the Heli Pilot and Monkey Sub, the latter proving that the monkeys are advanced enough to make nuclear power a thing (Austin, you may want to have a look at that). The Heli doesnt add any story to the games, at least, not that I found.

 And finally, on the list is BTD5. Yea. The FIRST BTD5 instalment is the LAST on the timeline. This is becoming FNaF. Now that I think about it, FNaF and this game have a lot in common. Fur. Robots. Murder. Say what you want but the monkeys *are* murdering the bloons. Any who, the upgrade system is ONCE AGAIN different in the BTD5 Versions. Now, there are 4 upgrades on each path. (Just gonna let you know, I will be using special notation for upgrades now. x|x means upgraded any amount of times on either side, up to 4 on one side and 2 on the other. E.G you can have 4|2 OR 2|4. A 0|0 monkey has no upgrades at all.) In this system, each tower has 8 upgrades, with a maximum of 6 being active at the same time. As stated in the brackets, you can have 4 on one side, and only 2 on the other. This happens because when you get to the third tier of one side, it will lock out the other third tier upgrade. You can still have a 2|2 monkey, but not a 3|3 or a 4|4. Now, onto why I had to explain that system.

In BTD4 Expansion, I mentioned the Temple Track. This track, I said, is the reason that BTD4 Expansion happens when it does. The reason for me bringing it up, is because the 4|x Super Monkey upgrade is the Temple of the Monkey God (TOTMG). The TOTMG, when upgraded, will sacrifice ALL towers in range and add that to its arsenal of weapons, usually it would only fire a large and powerful sun beam like the Sun God (3|x) upgrade does, however its less spread out and be able to go through more bloons. On top of that, when you upgrade to the temple, after your payment of $100,000 (What a sacrifice!) It will take the abilities of any Bomb Towers/Mortars, Apprentices, Glue Gunners, Ice Towers and any other tower. The Bomb Towers/Mortars give it a powerful MOAB destroying bomb, powerful enough to shred through an entire ZOMG (At max level), the Apprentices will give it a powerful tornado akin to a 3 or 4|x, the Ice Tower will allow it to freeze quite a few bloons nearby, this is usually made void by the sun beam, however, the glue gunner will allow it to glue TONS of bloons on the screen (glue cannot affect MOAB classes), however this is usually voided by the ice and sun beam, too, and the final tower(s) you choose will add a ring of darts around it, or blades from a blade shooter/maelstrom (x|3 and x|4 tack shooter respectively). That reminds me about abilities. Every towers (apart from the Banana Farm) x|4 upgrade is an activated ability. Which again, reminds me on how to unlock the upgrades. So, the more you use a certain tower, the more Tower XP you earn. This is different from regular XP in the way that tower XP is based on the number ofsayCannons you have on screen, and for how long. This way, it encourages you to use more Ice Towers, Villages and Cannons earlier on (even though considered terrible towers) so you have access to the Arctic Wind (3|x Ice Tower) Monkey Intelligence Bureau (x|3 Village) and MOAB Mauler (x|3 Cannon) earlier on. Now, back to the Temple. The TOTMGs power can be increased the more money you spend on towers in its radius, a common amount is $10k per tower type, however the most possible power is $30k, but the increase is marginal at best. And with thatI think we should go on to the next games in the series.

Ah, Bloons Monkey City. A resource management game. This game contains a surprising amount of lore, here. For the purposes of the theory, I will treat BMC Mobile and Flash as separate games, as Flash has some extra mechanics that Mobile doesnt have, and vice versa. So, you might assume that they take place in separate universes, right? Think again! I found evidence that everyone knows about, but didnt consider it as evidencemostly because people didnt think the timeline could actually existany who. The feature that Im talking about that solidifies FLASH as the next in the timeline is the second city, where when you reach level 5 in it, the Engineer is suddenly unlocked. This is massive. MASSIVE!!!! It proves that the flash and steam/mobile versions are in the same universe! Lets take a step back and see the new MOAB class that was added, further solidifying the place in the timeline: The DDT. DDT stands for Dark Dirigible Titan and has the Health of a MOAB, the speed of a Pink, the anti-sharpness of a lead, and the explosion resistance of a black. It is also camo. Yup. Camo. An easy way to pop it is get an x|3 village (Allows all towers within village range to pop all bloon types, except for glue to glue MOABs, sorry) with some MOAB maulers and 4|2 Ninjas. But even when you pop that tough layer, youre not out of the woods yet. You still have to face off against 4 camgrow ceramics! Steer clear! But really, thats all flash has to offer apart from MONKEY KNOWLEDGE PACKS. These cards were added in on March 12th, 2015, and they allow monkeys to become cheaper, and more powerful. This ties into the next game in the way that the cost keeps changing and the power keeps changing. But lets not get too ahead of ourselves. 

Next up is BMC Mobile, where you can unlock the sub, chipper, Heli Pilot and engineer through various special missions. Why the engineer can be unlocked in this separate way will be explained in the narrative. Essentially, there are 3 engineers in 3 cages along the track. It costs $450 to unlock them (which is the same as it would be in a normal game) and you get 1 engineer in your tower selection slot (its free). As long as you rescue 1 engineer AND survive, you will win. For the Bloonchipper, 1 wave of red bloons come to take some blueprints. If the bloons touch them, you lose 1 life. Then blue bloons, then greens, then yellows, then pinks, then alternating black and white bloons so the blacks go on the left and whites on the right, then zebras, rainbows, ceramics, and finally, 1 MOAB. For the Heli, spend $1250 to repair it, and it will fly. If the bloons reach it, you lose lives. Finally, for the sub, you have to defend against waves of bloons attempting to reach a broken 2|4 sub. If you have $20k, you can repair it and activate its special ability. The ability can one shot kill a FULL ZOMG. There are also 1|1 subs peppered around the map. The fact that these guys appear in such a broken state can only mean one thing. They were once a part of the city, before the bloons overran the tiles. The helicopter and subs were busted, and when they got wind of your plan to rescue these massive weapons, they went to destroy the evidence. Killing the monkeys, perhaps?

All of this, and I *still* havent done the upgrade system for BMC. Or even the tower mechanics. In BMC, you have a limited number of towers, and you gain more by increasing the amount of Dart Monkey Halls or Dartling Ammo Dumps (to name a couple) in your town  the more buildings you have that correspond to each tower, the more towers you have. You also need to build upgrade buildings to upgrade your towers. In Mobile, there is a different building for each tower, while in flash, some towers share (e.g. Spike Factory and Tack Shooter, Dartling Gun and Sniper). You spend city cash (separate from in-game cash) to buy buildings and upgrades, and they are then translated into the game after the elapsed time has been taken to build/research it. There is also a Monkey vs Monkey feature, where you send bloons at other cities to pillage them, and they have a chance to defend. You read that right. The MONKEYS are controlling the bloons.

On that bombshell of a revelation, it was pretty easy to come up with the idea for a timeline  let alone construct one. And we arent even at our final game in the timeline: Bloons TD Battles. BTD Battles is likely the most popular Bloons TD game, due to the free price and competitive nature (bias). In Battles, the upgrade system is ONCE AGAIN different. But not too different. You start out with 5 towers  Dart Monkey, Ninja, Tack Shooter, Bomb Shooter and the Sniper. You earn currencies called medallions, and battle score (Honour, anyone?) that are used to gain new towers. Battle score will automatically unlock towers and upgrades, and medallions are used to purchase them. When you unlock a tower, you automatically can upgrade it to 2|2 in game, no extra payments required. However, you need a certain battle score to unlock 3|3 and 4|4 upgrades (No, you cant actually have a 3|3 or 4|4. Its still like BTD5 or BMC). A new tower that doesnt appear in any other game also exists: The Covert Ops Battle Response Agent (COBRA). The COBRA has the ability to get an extra $80 at the end of the round, make it so that bloons are one layer more dangerous, camo, or regen (or a mixture if you have multiple, max Camgrow Ceramic) or steal your opponents lives. The way you earn money is a little different, too. For the record, I wont be touching defence mode or card battles, because those guys are weird. But it proves my point that the monkeys control the bloons. So, assault mode/battle arenas. In the arenas, you gamble medallions to gain double the reward (so if you pay 5 and win, you get 10, netting a profit of 5) with each arena costing more medallions (5, 20, 100, 500, 2000, 10000, 25000, 35000) but netting a higher profit (should you win). So, the income system. During the game, you are not getting 1 cash for every bloon popped. Instead, you have a set income of $250 every 6 seconds. You can increase this income by sending out bloons against your opponent, be careful, though. Some bloons make more income per send but some are spaced out, so your queue will fill out shortly. My advice (even though this is a theory, not a game guideWTF?!?!?) is to send bloons in the top row for economy, and send the spaced bloons at the bottom for rushes. Its a good idea to send some grouped Yellows on round 8 to keep them occupied. Note that pink bloons are the most efficient, as they only cost $90 per send of 3 pinks, they give you 3.6 income, and the queue empties out so fast its extremely difficult to fill. Another eco option is to go with Banana Farms as your 3rd tower (provided you are proficient in the game and are playing in higher end arenas like the Ceramic Crucible or MOAB Pit, as well as having at least 3rd tier upgrades, or rolling it as your bonus.) With banana farms, I recommend a 2|3 if you only have 3rd tiers, but a 4|2 if you have the 4th tier. You can also send MOAB rushes that will decrease your income. These rushes are Slow cooldown MOAB, unlocked on round 18, Fast CD MOABs/Slow CD BFBs on round 20, FCD BFBs/SCD ZOMGs on round 22 and a FCD ZOMG on round 24.

FINALLY! We made it to the point where we can explain the narrative of the bloons! If you read through the 4300 (IKR!) previous words and looked at all the evidence, it is about to make sense. If you didnt, heres a TL; DR (Which some of you may think needs a TL; DR!) 

The monkeys were a peaceful race, until their land was threatened by the bloons. The monkeys gathered their forces and used some spare weapons lying around in the form of darts to pop these menaces. As the bloons got more powerful, they realised they needed sharper darts and the ability to see further, but even that was insufficient. They then used some random machines they saw lying around and used those to their advantage. Conveniently, the Tack shooter used to implant Monkey tacks were useful at popping bloons, given that the tacks were also sharp. They too, however also needed to be upgraded. They found a monkey well versed in the frozen arts to stall the bloons, giving their cannons used for demolition time to destroy them without the chance of missing. However, eventually, the going got too rough and they had to call upon the Super Monkey. Even the mighty super monkey, with his laser vision and extreme range was not able to hold off the bloons for too long, but they managed long enough for the monkeys to gain extra territory. After their defeat, the monkeys decided to train another kind of offence: The Boomerang Thrower. It threw the weapon in a curved path to counter any bloons daring enough to sneak past the corners. But the bloons were clever. They coated 2 black bloons in a thick, lead shell. Currently only penetrable by an explosion. Unfortunately for the monkeys, the explosion could only work once, for the blacks inside were immune. The other kind of bloon was 2 blacks, and 2 whites with a rainbow casing, making the bloon vulnerable to explosions and freezing, but the insides immune to both. The monkeys also had a brainwave, not unknown in their ancestors, and they created glue, that slowed down bloons and made it easier for them to be popped, and road spikes, which popped any bloon foolish enough to float by. At last, with the defence of the 3 territories, the Great Monkey War was looking good for the monkeys. The monkeys gained new lands in the long gap between tower innovations, but soon the current towers were gaining strain, and a new system of upgrades, along with new towers was needed to face the terrifying new bloons. The monkeys lost 3 lands but gained 8 new ones, and so the battles continued. With the innovation of the exploding pineapple, spike-o-pult and monkey beacon, things were looking good on the battlefield. To increase the amount of popping power one tower could have, the monkeys decided to fine-tune each upgrade they made to make it *absolutely* perfect for bloon popping power, and it wasuntil the bloons made countermeasures. The bloons coated some rainbows in a hard, ceramic layer, requiring 10 hits to pop that layer and only *then* did the monkeys have access to the rubbery insides of rainbow. The monkeys, however grew accustomed to it and handled them with ease. The bloons, desperate at this point created the MOAB, to run right through the defences and destroy the civilisation that had massacred so many of its kind. But, with the Super Monkey storm the beacon called in, not even the MOAB was able enough to take revenge on the monkeys, and so they pushed. The monkeys pushed hard. They pushed to the ends of the earth. They pushed till they got to the Ocean Road, till they got to the city, where the return of many monkeys was celebrateduntil the bloons got to them. At this point, the monkeys decided to redo the upgrading system yet again. They decided it was much more cost-efficient to have a linear system, and also to incorporate the spike-o-pult into the dart monkey. They also needed new towers. As they had reached the sea, they decided to enlist the help of nearby pirates. As fellow monkeys, the pirates were also under threat from the bloons, and used their knowledge of the seas to shoot farther, for the most part, this worked. And while the monkeys were busy defending against their common enemies, 4 new threats appeared. The pink bloon was the fastest bloon in the army, capable of reaching speeds of up to 3.5 RBS (Red Bloon Speed) and so many towers missed it. Another bloon that was created was the zebra, an amalgamation of the black and white that the monkeys never expected! At least they could counter it with the Monkey Ace that they had developed. The tech required to do that and then drop pineapples helped out a lot against the whites that came out of the zebra skin. It was a very good thing that the mortars they installed, the buccaneers they found and the planes they made were all capable of popping the hidden threat, the camo bloon. The monkeys found it was easy, once you had the right upgrades but struggled to find towers that were capable of popping such a menace. On top of the camo, on top of the ceramic, on top of the MOAB, was the BFB. When the monkeys heard of a new blimp, they were concerned, at worst, but not overly worried about it. That was when they saw it. They knew they needed something specifically designed to pop the BFB layer, and then the groups of MOABS inside of them. They turned to the cannon, and constructed special missiles designed to punch holes in the blimp skins and spread across a wide area of damage. It was no longer a game to the monkeys. Their population was under threat of another danger: Overpopulation. They needed to expand where they farmed. The decision to bring farms onto the battlefield was met with a mixed response, giving the idea a test run, at first. It was a success, and the farmers decided to split their profits with the war effort, increasing the amount of cash that the war front developed. Over time, the Banana Research Facility, enhanced, triple shot spike-o-pults and lightsabres were developed, increasing the chances of a victory. But then, tragedy struck. An unknown bloon circumvented the defences, and made it to the city, and almost all locations were lost. The monkeys were pushed back to the sandy shores, the subterranean sewers, the monkey temple, and the infamous Monkeyrose Trinana. The temple, against all odds, was reactivated in a blinding flash of light and ate through the MOABs and BFBs. Then another tragedy struck. The same bloon made it through and decimated almost all of the towers. Only the super monkey, and some other weapons remained. Only this time, the bloon was identified. It was the ZOMG. Along with his lab assistant, Dr. Monkey, Super Monkey upgraded himself very far, and reclaimed Dr. Monkeys lab on Monkey Lane. Due to this extraordinary feat, Super Monkey attempted to conquer all of Monkey Lane so it would be free of the bloon menaces. 25 long battles ensued, and Super Monkey faced his old enemy one on one: The MOAB. The MOAB was not alone, however, and brought some mini MOABs with it, they were easy, once you destroyed the shield. The MOAB didnt manage to survive for long, however, and was popped into many bloons, as the ceramic layer no longer mattered in defeating the monkeys. With the downfall of the MOAB, the Ice Monkey was revived from the block of ice that he had been stuck in since the temple defeat. Ice Monkey explained that after the ZOMG made it through, he chased it back to the Frozen Fields and was attacked by a Yeti, and then went off to pop it. Ice Monkey struggled a little bit, though. His ice weapons did not seem to affect the whites or zebras, so a mix of weapons was needed. When he finally managed to face the Yeti, it turned out to be a MOAB class bloon, like some others that Super Monkey had eradicated earlier, for good. It was a very quick battle with Ice Monkey emerging victorious. Ice Monkey then returned to the lab to report of all the bloons in the Fields. Dr. Monkey revealed he had been working on a way for either monkey to call the other into battle in his place. This turned out to decimate the bloons, and so the Frozen Fields had one giant menace left. The battle was long and tough, but the giant monster was obliterated. This released the electricity fields around another monkey, who managed to follow the ZOMGs to Helium Heights, when he was ambushed by 3! Ice Monkey snorted, saying that he heard it was red bloons. Super Monkey followed Storm Monkey into Helium Heights, believing that there was more to it than met the eye. Super Monkey faced off against 3 BFBs, the Skull on the back of the ZOMG, and a deceased Radadactyl, to name a few.

Super Monkey and the others then managed to take back the Ocean Road, Pool Table, Railway, and the Monkey Military Base, as well as capturing Bloonhenge, a Banana Factory, the famous bloon White MOAB, an Archipelago and some Floating Islands, to name a few. They also managed to rescue the other towers from the bloons grasp. However, this would not last long as the Monkeys were too greedy with their land and were forced to retreat to Monkey Lane, the Park Path and others, while places like Downstream of Snake River were lost. Super Monkey, who was experiencing PTSD [(which is apparently canon now)](https://ninjakiwi.com/blog/news/173229-what-s-up-at-ninja-kiwi-05-may-2017?page=2) rallied his forces to fight with 2 other divisions rescued from the collapsing military base: the Heli Pilot and the Submarine. They held out against the bloons for a while, but eventually the Monkeys defences gave way and some towers were captured and maps were lost. Here the monkeys faced the bloons and were far less than successful, being pushed to a small corner of the land, however, 2 dart monkeys and a farm remained, allowing the monkeys to re-capture some land. Here, the monkeys discovered the substance known as bloontonium and used it to create their own bloons to attack the other sub cities of the kingdom, also reduced to lesser amounts of towers. These cities fought back, all the while expanding together. The banana land was rediscovered, causing monkeys to fight over it, while further expanding their cities. All this expansion however, caused the DDT to take notice, and they decided they had to rush through the defences of the monkeys in order to keep them at bay. Fortunately, the monkeys were strong enough to defeat them all, and the great bloon war was over. 

The monkeys, now safe from the bloon threat and able to control them, organised the most powerful cities together in a tournament of monkey versus monkey, where each city had the opportunity to send 3 kinds of monkey into battle with the option of a 4th tower being selected for them. Ground rules were established that every city would start with 50 medallions and 0 battle score, and those would be used to unlock new towers and upgrades for use within battle. While in battle, the towers would have to face a set wave of bloons and would earn income every 6 seconds based on the formula 250+r+1.7b+2.4g+3y+3.6p and so on, for each bloon sent. They also made it so that if you cant have negative income so that massive rushes would be possible, and a possible but difficult recovery. Eventually, the era of the bloons ended and bloon deployment facilities were shut down. After all of the balance changes added to the bloon handbook, the Great Monkey War against the bloons was overfor now
