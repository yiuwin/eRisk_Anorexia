	<TEXT> It's not much of an urban legend, considering that it actually happened. Several years ago, when I was just a kid in elementary school, there was a murder at my best friend at the time's next door neighbors' house. I don't remember exactly how the story went, but from what I remember, the 20-something-year-old sun came home at like 3 AM and his mom was mad and they got in a fight and he ended up stabbing her to death.

I come from a city just inland of Malibu that has an extremely low crime rate. The only crimes you really hear of out there are peoples' mansions getting broken into or some dumbass who was speeding down the canyon and crashed. So everything is fine and then BOOM--a guy stabs his mother to death. That was definitely a big shock, so a lot of people were freaked out for a while. I don't remember what the verdict of the case was, but I'm sure I'll be able to find out if any of you are interested.

**TL;DR: A guy stabbed his mom to death in the house next to my friend's.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not me but a friend. This was during last year's LA naked bike ride (or whatever the event is called). So my friend just randomly looks out her apartment window one day and there's just hundreds of people bike riding down the street...most of them completely naked.  </TEXT>
