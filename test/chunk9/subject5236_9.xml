	<TEXT> On the flip side, I was dating a girl who had recently broken up with her previous boyfriend of 2 months and would constantly bring up him and the guys before him. I ultimately broke up with her for it because she only ever talked about exes, and they weren't even long term  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a white person, my love of reading stemmed from encouragement from the good schools I went to and my solid family structure. Many poor African American kids don't have access to good education or a good home life. You can't be mad at a man for trying to help people who need that help. 

Edit: it would be racist if he was like "fuck white people and all races except blacks, only blacks deserve help" </TEXT>
