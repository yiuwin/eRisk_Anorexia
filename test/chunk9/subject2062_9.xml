	<TEXT> While this great, there is also a slight error. Germany didn't get crazy drunk. The first time Germany promised something to a dude with family problems (Austria) and got dragged into a dispute. After the dispute Germany felt betrayed and got the idea stuck in his head that he should get what "rightfully" was his.

At least that's kinda how we are taught WW1 and WW2 in Germany. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm not excited for my vacation </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I never was one to take vacations. After I started working I just could not be bothered to take the time and all to prepare a vacation. When I had to take days off from work, I live in Germany we have a guaranteed payed leave and at most companies you loose your "stored" days from the year before after march, I mostly spend the free days sitting in front of my pc.

This year however my mother and her husband gave me a great offer. Two weeks of Cuba with flight for a price that was really nice. So after a few days of thinking about it, I took the offer. The vacation starts in roughly a month. But I'm not excited or anything. I even took a scuba course with her husband so that we could dive together in Cuba. But beside the diving I don't know what I will do. I hope that I may meet people there, but as I'm shy as fuck I doubt it. So I will spend the two weeks either diving, sightseeing or nothing at all.

I know these are first world problems, but it's just annoying. Why can't I be excited for my first real vacation in years? The last time I had vacation where I was not at home or at friends was when I was 14. That's nearly half my life ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Surely she is not the most mature around, but OPs reaction to it seems to me to be way more immature than hers.

 but it's not something you tell them right before their second date with you.

It's not like she did without reason. She canceled the plan with OP and instead of lying to him, she told him the truth why she could not make it. I'm not saying that cancelling one person to go onto a date with another is the best course of actions. But if you do so and then lie about it, it gets worse tenfold. Honesty is a major part of any realtionship.


 I'm scratching my head and the only logical reason I'd want to tell a girl that is if I wanted her to leave me alone. So I guess OP has his answer?...
It's for this reason I assume she just isn't really that interested in OP.

As I said above maybe she just didn't want to lie to OP. If she really wasn't interested in him she would just cancel and not reschedule. There is so much we don't know, we neither know her nor OP really. As I said in my other comment directly to OP. If this really killed his mood for her then he should at least be honest to her about it, the same way she was to him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  sounds like she's a little immature tbh

Honestly, the polar opposite is the case in my opinion. She is being honest with OP and he is reacting immature. Instead of lying to him she straight up told him the truth why she was not able to make it. It's not like they were/are exclusive, they had one date.

OP you should just go to the date and see how it develops further. Maybe nothing comes of it, maybe you realise that there is more to it. Who knows, but saying "No way there will be a relationship with her" because of something stupid and petty like this shows me, that you seem to be immature. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So most of this story happened actually a few months ago, but today something happened that reminded me of it. I work for a small webhosting firm where we are a grand total of 5 people, where two are the bosses, two are external contractors and then me.

Anyhow, it was decided between the bosses and the sysadmin that plain IMAP, POP3, SMTP and FTP will be phased out starting April of this year. Naturally people are going crazy because even through we informed them several times over the span of a few month "suddenly" their mails or FTP are not working. Most of the time we just walk them through the steps to switch to secure TLS connection.

However this one client has a problem. He is still using Contribute from Adobe and this piece of software does not support FTPS. So we give him a program which acts as an wrapper inbetween Contribute and our servers to "teach" Contribute FTPS. For whatever reason the connection test works fine, but when you want to publish it always fails. After hours of using big G and trying different configurations both I and the customer are ready to give up.  
But before I do that I have one final idea. You can hook up a WebDAV storage as an drive in Windows and then tell Contribute to publish localy to that drive. But damn the customer has an older package which does not contain WebDAV. However I am given some leeway in such things by my bosses so I decide to unlock WebDAV for him without costs. After all he is a long running customer and was nice thorugh it all.  
After activating WebDAV for him I call him and set everything up on his computer so he can start using Contribute again. It works and customer is happy. The End or so I thought. Today as I was waiting for parcel to arrive for me, one did arrive for me. However it was not what I expected as I opened it [this beauty](http://i.imgur.com/JDcz0Zc.jpg) (for the non German speakers it's applejack from a region in Germany) greeted me. Completly confused, because I didn't remember ordering alcohol of anykind I ask one of my bosses if he knows shit about it.

 $boss: Yeah that's from this guy $customer, you remember him right? He contacted us on FB and asked if you drank alcohol. Nice, isn't he.

I sit there in stunned silence, not really knowing what to say or do. I'm used to customers thanking me, but sending something as a thanks was something new. I send the customer a mail thanking him for this kind gift and all.

P.S. Sorry if it's rambly or anything. I'm still kind of in shock about it. Also I haven't tasted it yet, because I don't dring alcohol if I have work the next day. </TEXT>

For the non German speakers it means that you are allowed to use the second lane from the right if there are other vehicles on the most right lane. There don't have to be constantly cars but occasionally is enough. The whole only applies if you are outside of city boundaries.

	<TEXT>  The left lane is for 150 kp/h+ (90mph)

That is bullshit and there is no base for it anywhere. The left lane on an Autobahn is for take over. If the speed limit is 120km/h and one over takes an other driver being slower while not going over the speed limit it's totally legal and **not** hogging anything.

Same even if you are driving 150km/h and the right lane is empty you actually have to use the right lane and not the left one. If there are three lanes you can choose between the right most and the middle one. </TEXT>

False, the first smartphone to be widley adapted was created in 1999 in Japan. Also before that there were PDAs. Blackberry started in 2004. Smartphones are not a new invention, the only thing that may be "new" is the combination of a phone with a touchscreen, but that can be argued.

As for the GPS part, I would argue that there were already phones or simmilar shaped and formed handheld devices that contained GPS. While there were huge changes in the tech landscapes from then to now, most of the core technologies were already there and used. Maybe not in the configurations we see today tough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First things first....uber is by no means a car pooling platform at least not in the traditional sense.

 They wanted 70 for a 1h ICE trip from the Frankfurt Flughafen to Cologne HbF. 70. Just think about that for a minute.

ICE is expensive if you don't plan the trip early enough. I paid in total 150 from Cologne to Berlin for both ways together. I bought the ticket a few month prior.  Also for the quoted way you could also go with an IC for 40, which takes roughly 2hrs. 

Another thing how much would you pay for a flight ticket or Fernbus? And how long would it take you?

 A while back I could take the train and visit my brother for barely 16, which wasn't cheap, but not too expensive either. That same connection now costs at least 20,20, making it at least 25% more expensive. 

From where to where? Here in NRW the price is 18,40 for a SchneFahrtTicket or 29 for a SchnerTagTicketSingle (42 for 5 person variant). This are the prices directly form the Bahn, there are different costs for different Verkehrsverbnde though and the prices of that are not made by the Bahn, but by the Verbund.

 My gf did an (typically unpaid) internship for 6 months where she needed to commute 1-1/2h per trip. Ticket costs where at the point where she needed to cut back on other things to even be able to afford the basic transportation. 

Honestly, your gf got screwed over. If she was still school, school should've covered the costs. If the was in uni normally her SemsterTicket should suffice. If she got support from the Agentur fr Arbeit they would've given her at least part it back, if the internship was part of getting a job. There are so many ways.

 Granted, if you were paying these tickets with your 2-3k job, you probably don't care. But then again, public transportation should be affordable for everyone which it is unarguably not.

I don't have a 2-3k job, I get around 1,2k per month. While the 120/month do hurt somewhat, they are still way less than a car would costs until it's payed off completly. Granted a car has it's benefits but I'm living in an area that has pretty good connections.

 ICE is basically just for "rich" people nowadays. Nobody with an average salary will pay ticket prices for those.

I disagree again as long as you plan enough ahead ICE is not expensive and sometimes even cheaper than most alternatives.

 Combine that with a hugely confusing pricing policy (why is it ok that it's price X to take the train from A to B but price Y if you take the same train from B to A? God damn these different "Verkehrsbetreiber". It's ridiculous)

Never seen that as long as the connection was the same. So if I take RE 1 to drive vom A to B and later back, I always payed the same. However sometimes it was faster to take RE2 to C and then RE 3 to A, which was more expensive, because I was crossing Verkersbnde and shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  and insanely expensive. The later making it not an option for anyone with a low income.

Weird the ones I see/hear bitching about the prices for the most part are the ones with more than enough income to pay for the tickets and often times they just take the train once every three years. I'm not saying it's cheap, but it's also not as expenisve as you make it out to be. Also prices are often times not from the Bahn direkt but by the local Verkersbund. </TEXT>

Even through the PCs are adventueres there will be days that are not taxing on anything. There are days where you walk around and nothing happens or there are days you spend in town with diplomacy.

However if you and your players want to play such a game, go ahead, but I don't think it should be part of the core or something. </TEXT>

Yes, there should be teachings about constent and such, but it should not be limited to men. Not only because it would be sexist to do so, but also because there are women out there who raped men.

You see my problem is not with the point that the best course of action would be to teach what not to do, instead of only teaching protection against said acts.

	<TITLE> [Purchasing Help][Germany] Looking vor 144Hz G-Sync Monitor for Gaming </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-24 15:39:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As the title states I'm looking for a 144Hz G-Sync monitor for mainly gaming purposes. My most played games currently are Dota 2, CS:GO, Arma 3, X-COM 2 and I'll play The Division when it comes out.

Resolution should be at least 1080p and at most 1440p as I'm not interested in 4K at the moment. Size should be 27" and G-Sync would be nice to have. At most I seek to spend 700 though a bit more is not that big of a deal.

My specs are:
i7-5820K OC'ed to 3,7GHz
MSI GTX-980TI


All I found with my little knowledge of monitors is the Acer Predator XB270HUbprz though I'm kind of hesistant as it's on the top of my price range.

As I said it's more the reason for them to play on EUW and EUE . But Russians are weird sometimes ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Up/Down is drastically faster in Sweden.

And that means what? Nothing if the signal travling time is longer. As far as I know the route from Russia to Sweden is not the short way they are apart on a map.

EDIT: To expand on this: You have a customer grade connection, servers are completly different point. Don't compare you connection to the one of a dedicated datacentre.

 Secondly, that's still, by far, under the travel time for a signal to travel to DC/NYC/Virginia like most NE servers in the US are.

Not saying that it's the only reason, but I know that it's part of the reason at least for Europe West and East, which are located in Luxembourg and Vienna.

Also from Germany I have ~100ms ping to one of the US server (I think US East) and also ~100ms to Russia. I would wager that Russia has their own routing to the US so it may actually be nearly the same ping. </TEXT>

Denmark surrendered to Germany after shipping most of their jews to Sweden and Norway.

	<TEXT> While I agree that the German cases maybe hard to understand for a non native and even native speaker, they do serve a purpose. They are intended to make the relation in the sentence clearer.

E.g. A noun in the first case "Nominativ" is the subject of the sentece, A noun in the secound case "Genitiv" is used to show possesion, objects in a sentence can be of this case, and so on.

Granted one case to rule them all is easier to speak and write but it can be harder to understand without context what is what in a sentence.

All in all I think from an outside perspective every language is kind of bullshit, because as far as I know not one follows and only and truly logical pattern.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm kind of split on the early access example. It depends on how the developers are treating the early access. There are great early access examples, where they used it to get feedback from the fans and at the same time maybe get more funds for developing.

A good example in my mind is Kerbal Spaceprogramm. It was in early access a pretty long time but from what I can tell Squad listened to their community often and has now completed a pretty nice game. Another example would be Starbound in my mind, which is still in early access, but they showing what they are working on and interacting with the community.

But most examples are sadly bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And yet, rugby players play to the whistle, even with blood pouring.

Football players used to, but are not allowed anymore. When the ref sees that you are bleeding you have to leave the field to be treated. You are not allowed on the field with an open bleeding wound. I have seen football payers with a cut leave the field get a bandage get on again and get send off again by the ref because they started beeding again.

Also one has also to consider the difference in the way the games are meant to be played. While football is not an contact free sport it's not as much build around the contact as rugby or American Football or Ice Hockey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to see it this way: They are not pussies, but they are often times playing pussy. Calling a foul in football (I refuse to call American Football just football) is harder then in American Football, because there is no replay for the refs, there are at max 5 refs in total of whom at max 3 are in a position to see a foul at all. In most leagues there are only max 2 refs to see a foul. A side ref and the main ref. I have yet to find a statistic that show how many flops that are successful against how many unpunished fouls are there. I honestly think the latter is happening more often. </TEXT>

So? In my opinion it's more than clear the he gets a bit out of it. It's not undisclosured, because it's out there in the open. Affiliate links like that are normal in the www for a pretty long time now. Many companies offer something like that. Heck even the smallish company I work at offer affiliate links to their customers and non customers if they are interested. Besides I think the video you are refering to in your first comment [is this one](https://youtu.be/qi5KsJDTiV4). Well [skip to this bit then](https://youtu.be/qi5KsJDTiV4?t=3m58s), where he talks about Lootcrate and his affiliation with them.

All in all I stay with my sentiment, you are making a way to big deal out of it. About something that is pretty normal in the www and is far from what is shown in the tweet.

However we can never be sure that Dan or anybody is telling the truth unless we would find a contract that states otherwise. For me that means in Dans case not guilty until proven otherwise. </TEXT>
