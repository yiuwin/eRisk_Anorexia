	<TEXT> I am a broke down xylophone

Made up of skin and angry bone

And in between, where parts are tender

Is what results when feelings render

I eat my anger

I starve my sad

Every pound

A memory had

The sound the tender makes drones on

I only want to hear the bone </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fellow non torso person in the house, woot woot. 

I know *exactly* what you mean. I have found one thing that helps me feel more comfortable about my shape is wearing youth tops. They just fit better than regular clothing when you have a 1" torso (lol/sobs) and don't need all the excess length that normal tops leave.

	<TEXT> I have various levels of binging. I don't keep junk food, or many ready-to-eat foods in my house so if I were to binge on anything at home, I'd just be eating a bunch of healthy boring crap that takes time to prepare and I usually just get over the urge to stuff my face rather than actually cook something lol. So I might eat three yogurts instead of one and a bunch of fruit or something like that. Not really a binge, but enough to fuck with my head.

Then there is the predetermined binge. The one where you've been fighting the urge for a week and you know it's going to happen so you just say fuck it, prepare for it mentally and try to plan the least calorie-laden way to do it while still satisfying all your urges. I have two versions of this. One, where I do it in a controlled manner and eat things that aren't safe foods for me, but still don't go over my maintenance calories, or I exercise the excess off. And two, where I *plan* to do it like a human with some semblance of self control but shit happens. Like, you get to the grocery store and some crazed demon takes over and puts all sorts of shit in your cart and the next thing you know, you are shoving donut holes into your mouth before you even get out of the parking lot because you are *so goddamn hungry* and you dgaf about calories you just need to satisfy this monster inside of you. Then three hours later, after you've purged, either voluntarily or involuntarily, and you sit there on the bathroom floor crying about what a fucking loser you are, you start to mentally calculate your damage and let's see, there was the donut holes, the birthday cake ice cream, the trail mix, the candy bars, the doritos, the spoonfuls of peanut butter and omfg kill me. These binges can easily tally up to 5,000+. Luckily those don't happen very often.

	<TEXT> I've been doing a high restriction of 1000-1200 max for the past week or so in an attempt to get back to a place where I can start running again, and to hopefully keep binge urges away. I went through a bad binge spree after a super low restriction streak and oddly enough, lost more weight during the last week of higher cal days than I did during two weeks of 500 or less days. I think because I had more energy to be more active, and plus some of the binge weight was probably water weight but still....it felt damn good to see the scale back down at 90 after feeling like I had blown everything.

Good luck! It sounds like a good plan! </TEXT>

Don't let this dude get you down! If he didn't fall for you, that's on HIM..not you! And to be entirely realistic, you could be the most gorgeous person on the planet to 99 guys, but he may be the 100th guy that goes for an entirely different look. It doesn't have to say anything about your looks or desirability, just his preferences. 

Loads of people think Brad Pitt is sexy. I don't. Lots of people think Katy Perry is beautiful. I don't. And that's okay. That doesn't mean they aren't crazy attractive, just that they aren't attractive *to me*.

I know it hurts, and it feels like a huge rejection right now so have yourself a little cry but don't let it consume you.

You hold your head high and be proud of yourself because you have worked hard, lost weight, been strong and you WILL find that person who thinks you are the brightest star in the fucking sky, darlin'. 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've only tried the cake batter flavor, but it was pretty good. Especially for the calories. It did seem to have an odd aftertaste but that could just be me and anyways, for the low calories, I'm cool with an aftertaste lol.

I can find it much easier where I live than Halo Top, too. Walmart carries it here so no more 30 minute drives for an ice cream urge, yay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in the South and the way food is cooked here grosses me out! I can only imagine how gross it would be for someone to visit who wasn't used to our ways. It's seriously so gross. Everything is butter or lard fried, sugar-fied and supersized. I swear children are born here eating Moon Pies and fried bologna sandwiches and washing it down with a pitcher of sugary af sweet tea or a 2 liter of Sundrop. Gag.

Even "healthy" food makes me suspicious unless I prep it myself. Healthy to other people is "I only used *one* stick of butter!" No thanks lol.

Oh, and welcome to the sub! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can totally relate to eating for comfort. I used to do it every time I was sad, lonely, anxious, etc. It felt like I was filling some void that I couldn't fill any other way...until the guilt overpowered the temporary relief the food provided and then I hated myself even more. I've really had to work hard to overcome the self medicating with food thing. 

I'm sorry you're having a rough time. *hugs* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happens to me far more than I'd like to admit. 

Me, at dinner time: NO. I cannot eat that *insert something really low cal* for dinner because too many calories and I really wanted to stay under this amount for the day. Have some self control, you fucking loser. *eats lettuce instead.* 

Also Me, at midnight: Omfg I am so hungry. I only ate 400 calories today I can technically have a small snack. *Measures out one serving size of ice cream that I have been craving for a month. Eats serving. Feels guilty. Cries a little. EATS WHOLE CONTAINER. Cries a lot.*

Sighhhhh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spent four hours obsessing over a meal that had, at most, 200 calories because it was going to put me over my predetermined daily allowance for the day. Ate it after much turmoil. Cried about eating it because I felt like such a weak piece of shit.

Then I proceeded to binge on sugary garbage like an insane motherfucker an hour later, while crying more but hey, it turned into the crying that makes me puke so bonus I guess. Stupid brain. Kill me lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not just you! 

I hide. I don't enter my binges on MFP either because then my failure is there staring me back in the face. I avoid everything until I can get back on track. 

Sometimes this sub is helpful for getting me out of my binge slumps but sometimes I get the whole "oh I'm not the only one" mentality which almost makes me feel like it's normal so I am less appalled at myself and it is almost enabling. So I just avoid mostly, just in case. I never know which asshole voice in my head is going to be in control. :/

I wish I could just pay someone to follow me around and slap food out of my hands lol.

	<TEXT> I've been dealing with the same thing, I hit 89 lbs and cannot seem to lose from there regardless of my intake. I've tried decreasing, tried increasing, tried being more active, etc. I said "fuck it" when I was dealing with a bad few days and ate like a cow and gained 5 lbs in like three days. Like wtf?? It takes me two weeks to lose one pound but I can gain 5 lbs in a few days? I am so disheartened. 

Basically where I'm at right now is I'm just going to try to eat a normalish amount, but still below my TDEE and not weigh myself for two weeks and see what happens. If anything, hopefully I will have more energy and can exercise more.

Hang in there! I know technically it's all about calories in/calories out, but when you get stuck at a standstill and the scale isn't showing lower after a prolonged period of time, it definitely feels like something is wrong and CICO no longer applies to you. But it does, and the scale will show it eventually.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Omg, raisin cinnamon bread is my ultimate devil. *I too have eaten an entire loaf.*

I eat keto, so carb totals for me above 25g a day are a no-no. So why I buy it in the first place is a huge mystery. The other mystery is why I think I can eat "just one piece so it fits in my macros" when I know damn well it's a binge food for me.
