	<TEXT> The clockspeed limitation. I feel, has more to do with Samsungs technology(14nm silicon process) than AMD itself. As you have probably already noticed, any of chips(the 8 core or the 4core) just don't go over 4.1GHz. Even 4.2 is obtainable at a crazy 1.5mV. The record overclock they had on Ryzen(6.9GHz?) had a pretty high vcore voltage.

So, if Samsung doesn't improve they it process, AMD week have to find a way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This review is of an OC'd 2017 1060 9Gbps card which was recently released by nvidia. 

Really expected it to outshine the 580. While it does beat it in most games, the fps difference is very small. From 2-4 fps in average fps. However, in minimum fps, the card takes a pretty bad hit at times, while the 580 holds on. 

Sadly this review didn't include frametimes or 0.1% or 1% benchmarks.  

The other section where it beats the 580 is power usage. 

The site gave it the editors choice award.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow. You found a X79 mobo?  

Off topic for a bit.  
Some ppl like to experiment with them. Apparently they support Xeon. Some xeon proc with 8c/16 T but at a throwaway price. (Since those Xeons have been previously been used in servers and then replaced by newer models) . There's a bunch of cheap high core count Xeons you can get for super cheap off ebay and pair them with the X79 mobo. While their clock speeds aren't that great, the high core count for cheap makes for a good video rendering rig or something. Just thought you should know. There's a bunch of videos on the topic on YouTube. Cheers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. Basically every ram frequency above 2400mhz is an OC. So you've to set it manually in the bios. You'll probably also have to specify the clocks. For best results and to be on the safer side check Pauls Hardware, BitWit or other such YouTube channels for Ryzen overclocking.  They always OC their RAM.

	<TEXT> If you plan on going for the Pentium G4560, you'll need to get new RAM, since it uses the newer DDR4 one. 

HDD. You can absolutely reuse this one. 

SSD : I would recommend a SSD. A small one 120/240GB one.  Where you cab store your OS and game files.  It enables everything to load much faster. But only if you can fit it into your budget. You can always add one later.  

The 1070 looks great. The 580 I recommended is actually a step below it. So that's a good choice.  

If you want to save up and buy step by step, you could always buy the 1070 first and then get the CPU, mobo and ram later. Although if you are in the US and live near a microcenter, you could get a great deal on the CPU+mobo combo. 

The FX is a good processor and if you want to save up, you can keep using it for a while.  Then later on upgrade to a 6/8 core Ryzen processor. 

Cheers mate. If you have any more questions, ask away.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will work.  But Frankly I'm a bit biased and would still recommend getting the G4560. The performance they processor gives for its price is amazing. Plus it's only a few bucks more as compared to the 6th gen 4400.

Getting your bios upgraded from a shop or a friend is much better than losing out on the processor. The hyperthreading, clock speed and overall performance make it work it.

Edit2:  that said, like someone else mentioned, you could get some parts off r/hardwareswap and save cash. Also, you could in that case get more details about the bios version if you do get your mobo there.  That said, be cautious while buying from there. While there are generally genuine people, scammers do hang out (and are usually promptly banned) . 

Another thing you could do is get deals on your parts from r/buildapcsales.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely.  They are. DDR4 RAM prices have doubled and tripled the last year. And it's being said they might go higher because of low yields. 

Btw. Here's the Ryzen post I mentioned :

	<TEXT> My bad. Thought you'd put the build you wanted rather than what you had. 

I'd say, go for a G4560 and a Gigabyte DS3 B250m mobo. 6300, while awesome in its day, has begun to show its age. 

Yes, I'm suggesting a dual core vs a 6 core. But looking at gameplay comparison from Digital Foundry, the G4560 wins against the FX 6300. 

Also it's a bit cheaper.  Best check out their comparisons on YouTube before buying.  

Second suggestion will be going for an RX 580 8GB. It'll be slightly cheaper and although a refresh is pretty good.  

Check r/buildapcsales to get some good deals. 

Would have suggested an R5 1400,but it'll bump up your budget quite a bit bit higher.

You can reuse quite a bit of stuff and even sell some to recoup costs.  Using which you can probably add an ssd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simple answer : no. It'll turn on but you won't have anything to see. 

Those ports are for the APUs they plan on releasing later. You could probably borrow someones old card and use it till you get Vega.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good build.  But not sure about the 1500X. BF1 is CPU intensive. And you'll possibly benefit from the extra cores the 1600 has if you plan on streaming in the future.  

So while overall its a good build I'd recommend going for the 1600. You can probably get one for cheap. There's a deal going on at r/buildapcsales on Ryzen processors. Maybe you can get your other parts cheaper there and save a few bucks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good rig.  Maybe half your SSD size and go for a WD Blue 1TB? or add it in addition to your current SSD? If your budget permits.

Also. Main thing actually. You can save a lot on the parts.  Check out r/buildapcsales.  Keep an eye out for the parts you want.  iirc there's a deal going on for the Ryzen processors there. You can probably snag a new R7 1700 for $289 or even lower.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The G4560 is a 7th gen Kaby Lake Pentium processor. While your mobo is made for a 6th gen one.  You'll have to either upgrade the bios using a 6th gen processor (which you can borrow from someone or get it done from a shop) or make sure it ships with the updated bios.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something's gone wrong with peek previews from the last couple beta updates. 

They are already zoomed in when you peek.  Like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/67ecbv). This is how it [looks when peeking](http://i.imgur.com/00lIeAC.jpg) (even when not dragging to zoom) . 

Tried looking in settings if this could be changed back to how it was before but couldn't.

The thing is it happens to some images. Not all. Happened completely randomly. Will get a screenshot it happens next time. </TEXT>
