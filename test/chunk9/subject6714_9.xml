I don't believe in any of them, but I can somehow see where they come from. The round earth conspiracy theory is something I simply can't wrap y head around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm on the fence regarding free will. We are certainly able to make choices, from the trivial (what am I going to cook tonight for dinner) to the more significant (should I bang this woman even if I'm married?). The question then is how much those decisions are affected by the environment (and genetics and whathaveyou).

Perhaps the answer then is that we do have free-will but it's bound to certain constraints, and that, like other traits, how much that free will can be affected by the environment will vary from person to person?

I don't know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me. A limited but well curated selection of beers. No admission fee. Beers served in half litre measures for those who prefer drinking to tasting. Good beer food. Music, only later. Preferably outdoors. Ideally, not too crowded.

Here in the Czech Rep., there are two events organised by the same people, one in May, the other in September. And they are the only two festivals I bother going. They have a few beers specially brewed for the festival, some gravity dispensed from proper wooden casks, and the organisers, who ran a brewery themselves, keep the number of breweries and beers limited pretty to stuff they like drinking themselves.  </TEXT>

A friend a couple of metres away told me to throw it to him so he could head it. I threw it a bit too high, he missed it, and the ball flew past him to the classroom's door, falling down just when the school's director was walking in. The ball didn't even touch her, just dropped at her feet. She screamed asking who it had been. I stood up, saying it had been me. She shouted at me and gave me a one day suspension.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are two that come to mind right now:

Six or seven years ago I was standing at the door of a small pub somewhere in Prague, deciding whether I should go in or not. An old man, with more than a few beers under his belt, came out of the pub and urged me to go in and to share his table. He ordered me a beer and begun talking. I couldn't understand most of what he was saying because he was slurring his words and my Czech wasn't yet that good, but I had long mastered the art of keeping conversation with drunkards and I mostly reacted to his intonation. He seemed to be happy with that. When I told him I had to leave, he insisted the beers were on him and told the owner not to take any money from me.

The other one happened 10 or so years ago. I was on my way to a client one morning, coming out of the metro (also in Prague), when I noticed a girl struggling with one of the ticket vending machines. Having been in that situation myself and knowing how confusing those machines can be for a newcomer, I offered to help her. She was Russian (I reckon) and didn't speak much English, but she accepted my assistance. She was also really, really beautiful. When I finished showing her how to buy the ticket, she looked at me in the eye, thanked me as if I had almost saved her life and gave me one of the most beautiful smiles I have ever seen in my life. And then she left. I was stunned speechless for a few seconds, in love with that woman. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good answer would be this old joke

Woman: Do you drink beer? Man: Yes.
Woman: How many beers a day?
Man: Usually about 3.
Woman: How much do you pay per beer?
Man: $5.00 which includes a tip.
Woman: And how long have you been drinking?
Man: About 20 years, I suppose.
Woman: So a beer costs $5 and you have 3 beers a day which puts your spending each month at $450. In one year, it would be approximately $5400 correct?
Man: Correct.
Woman: If in 1 year you spend $5400, not accounting for inflation, the past 20 years puts your spending at $108,000, correct?
Man: Correct.
Woman: Do you know that if you didn't drink so much beer, that money could have been put in a step-up interest savings account and after accounting for compound interest for the past 20 years, you could have now bought a Ferrari?
Man: Do you drink beer?
Woman: No.
Man: What color is your Ferrari?

Basically, people will spend the money (or at least much of it) on other stuff. Before becoming a parent, I travelled quite a bit and went out for drinks several times a week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not long ago, I read an answer here about the horrendous conditions the survivors of the concentrations/death camps were found by the Allied troops. Their numbers were in the thousands (can't remember now how many exactly). What I'd like to know is how long in average had those people spent in the camps? Had they been brought directly to the camp they were found or had they been moved from other camps? Were they given food during their detention? Were they expected to do anything for their captors or just sit there waiting to be exterminated? Are there any figures regarding survival rates (how many were brought to a given camp vs how many were found alive when the camp was liberated)? </TEXT>

If not, and with an almost quagmire in Japan, plus China (what effect could this timeline have had in the Chinese civil war that broke in full swing after WWII?), it is possible that tensions would have escalated. It is also possible that Japan would have chosen to surrender to the US/UK before the Soviets got a firm foothold in their homeland. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beer, or rather proto-beers were invented independently at several different places. My theory is that it was mostly accidental. Someone cooked a grain (or another kind of starch) for long enough to soften it and turn that starch into sugars (that's mashing process). Because wort (the "sugary soup" you get after mashing) doesn't have much of a taste, they probably flavoured it with honey, fruit, berries; whatever they had at hand. If you let that stay for a bit (sometimes it can be as little as a few hours) that mix will start fermenting either thanks to the yeast already on the fruit or honey or yeast that go there some other way (it could have [been fruit flies](https://www.wired.com/2014/10/beer-yeast-attracts-fruit-flies/)). Someone then drank that slush and liked the taste. The rest is history. One thing to bear in mind, though, those early beers would have been hardly alcoholic and probably tending to sourness (like modern Kvass).

Bread could have been similar. Check a recipe for sourdough and imagine that happening by accident.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm working on the translation of a book, in English "The Elegant God -- An Alternative Model of Existence". I accepted the job because I thought I would read something intelligent, even if I probably would agree with. 

That turned out not to be the case. It's full of bullshit of all sorts, supported by weak arguments, logical fallacies, absurd claims without any proof or even a references, stupid examples, contradictions and inconsistencies; the works. But among all that there is one thing that stands out. According to him, there is indisputable proof that the scientific claim that a relation between caloric intake and expenditure is important for survival is evidently blind. No, it's not breatharians (whom he mentions in passing as insufficiently verified reports) but the statistically significant number of people who survived the hard labour and even worse conditions of concentration camps, despite receiving only a minimum of food. According to him, those people are proof that it is possible to survive in the long-term with a caloric expenditure far exceeding the caloric intake.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I'm not wrong, the wars following the Protestant reformation (and preceding it, let's not forget the Hussite Wars) were more political than religious. Luther didn't end up like Jan Hus because he had powerful people supporting him, and after the disaster that were the Hussite Wars for the Church, few of them wanted to have another go at it. By the time the 30 year war broke, the Protestant Reformation was already in full swing, with people like the King of Sweden Gustavus Adolfus among the protestant ranks. 

I think peace would have come one way or another, the war had been devastating for much of Europe, and I doubt many rulers were willing to keep on fighting much longer, regardless of what the Church had to say about it (in fact, the Pope wasn't at all happy with the outcome of the treaty).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps I didn't make my self clear, but when I said "objective" evidence I was referring rather to things like "the Earth is a globe orbiting the Sun". 

In any case, since sensory perception is subjective (with which I agree strongly), it does depend to some extent on consensus. We all know what cat and mat look like, and if the cat was black, we would all agree on that (or at least, everyone who can see the cat); likewise if the mat was red. 

Regarding truths about morality, don't they depend more strongly on consensus, or is there something that could be called a "Universal Morality"? (sorry if I'm getting off-topic here) </TEXT>

The cat in the mat is easily falsifiable, either it is there or it's not, but what about more abstract things, can they be said to be "true" within the correspondency theory? 

In any case, I will read those links, thanks again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read Campbell's "Transformations of Myth Trough Time" almost 20 years ago and was a bit fascinated by it. Though I would have expected scholarship to have moved on since then, I'm surprised to learn that Campbell is so controversial. Why is that, if I may ask? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use my computer for work (I'm a translator), internet browsing, listening to music and watching films, basically. As pretty much everybody else, I started with Windows (well, actually, I started with DOS, but I'm quite old already). Back in 2008, I had a really old PC running Windows XP and I was very frustrated with the experience. Not because of anything inherently wrong with Windows, but because my PC wasn't up to the task any longer, but I couldn't afford buying a new one, or even upgrading the one I had (we had just moved to a new house). I had read several articles praising Ubuntu and I asked a couple of IT pros if they would recommend it, and they did, with some caveats. 

I took the chance, installed it with the intention of running a dual boot for some time, but I was very happy with it from the get-go. I had very little problem adapting to the new interface, most of the programs I used were either available or a decent enough alternative was. 

When my wife, who's even less tech-savvy than me, set up her home office, her employer at the time gave her a budget to buy a notebook, I told her to get one without OS, and we installed Ubuntu. She had hardly any problems with the new interface and, like me, has been a happy Ubuntu user since then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is that if the people in the country actually don't want that, then there's nothing to be worried about. 

Really, I don't like drinks like Coke, etc., I think they are shit, and I refuse to buy my daughter any of it, and yet I believe it is a really silly piece of legislation, the sole purpose of which is to make some legislators feel better about themselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - There's the perception that the EU has grown into this huge beaurocracy that issues pointless, and Byzantine, regulations for no other apparent reason than keeping those bureaucrats busy; the fact that many of those regulations often seem to disregard local customs for the sake of uniformity, doesn't help either. (I'm not saying I agree with that, but it is what many people think). 

- Few people know, or are interested in knowing, what the purpose of the EU Parliament is. On top of that, the media often reports on half baked proposals by obscure MEPs almost as if the were constitutional amendments.

- Local governments LOVE to blame the EU (the Dictates from Brussels, as they call them here) for any hamfisted policy they shouldn't even have considered in the first place; all while gladly grabbing those EU structural funds.The refugee situation has, of course, served to aggravate things further. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a couple of friends that are vegan or vegetarian and they keep it pretty much to themselves. In fact, I found out about one during a weekend trip in Germany, when the whole group decided to have lunch at a beer-hall. He told us he wouldn't have anything (the menu had no vegan options), just beer, but the waitress was great sport and had a massive bowl of salad prepared for him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in a phase where I hardly give any fucks about labels and categorisations (including "Craft"). I want to drink good beer (and by that, I mean beer that I like),  at a reasonable price, and don't care too much about who makes it or why. If a small, local Craft Brewery can't provide me that, I will have no problem whatsoever with giving my money to a macro brand. 

I also don't care about novelties or the flavour of the week. There's plenty of good, if not great, beers around for me to gamble on the product of a new brewery that still hasn't found their feet in terms of quality control. Unless I have a good reason, I will give them at least half year. It's similar with "gimmicky beers". Though I'm far from a purist, I think the four basic ingredients of beer already offer more than enough diversity and complexity and a pisco-barrel aged beer brewed with Guatemalan Papaya and the yeast from a rep's armpit is of very little, if any interest. This doesn't mean that I am against brewers having a bit of fun with their recipes; brewing is a business and the market is pretty competitive, if brewing a gimmick helps them get their name out there, good for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It may, and it may not. It will all depend on what a significant part of the population will do with that money. Will they keep their 9-to-5s (those who have it) or will they leave it and fulfill some dream like setting up their own business, doing voluntary work, become stay-at-home parents or take lower paying jobs but more fulfilling? And if the production of certain goods, like books, for instance, is fully automated, wouldn't that result in a lower price? (disclaimer, I've no idea how much labour affect the production cost of a book, I'm using it as only as an example that can be replaced for something more suitable) </TEXT>
