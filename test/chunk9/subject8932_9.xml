	<TEXT> Awesome game. Really enjoying it. 
Who are the OP characters?  
Ive watched some drift0r vids and he gives great in depth info on a variety of things in the game. 

As a complete noob im using Soldier 76 he seems to work really well.  What are some other great characters? 

In a couple vids there's this female character that gets into a mech machine and she looks great...

However it's taking its toll on my available gig of Internet lol. 

Is there any way I can download the broadcasts using my wifi at home so I dont waste internet streaming it whilst on the move?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got it a couple times and it's awesome, destroys enemies with ease. It's basically the AC130, but stronger.

I gotta say I'm a little dissapointed with the other kistreaks that I have. Looking forward to getting the R-C8 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everything for me is going so well. Glad I can finally run round a corner, see 3 enemies with their back to me and not get scared that I'll kill one and another will spin 180degrees to kill me.

Feels like I can finally get quad kills quite easily!! I'm actually loving it so far. Gun sounds are awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The weapon balancing is not off... IW did a phenomenal job with weapon balancing / hit detection. It's too fast though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love running the Brecci + Long Barrel + Fast Mags + Extended Mags and I have to have Scavenger and Gung-Ho.

What do you guys enjoy playing with?

I've been tempted to try out the Haymaker, anyone prefer it over the Brecci? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Andy's mom is Emily, Jessie's previous owner, from Toy Story.

Do you know any other cool/mysterious theories or links between movies in any way shape or form?

During the iconic diner scene in Pulp Fiction Mia Wallace, played by Uma Thurman, explains the plot of a TV pilot she was in. Her description of a group of female secret agents sounds oddly familiar if you've ever seen another Quentin Tarantino film called Kill Bill. Wallace says that she played a character who was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife (the description given to Thurman's character in Kill Bill). And, of course, during the Pulp Fiction scene Wallace is talking to Vincent Vega, a character who shares the last name of Mr. Blonde (a nickname given to the character Victor Vega) from Reservoir Dogs.  </TEXT>
