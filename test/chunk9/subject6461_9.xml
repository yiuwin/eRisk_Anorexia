	<TITLE> Premades are a pain to play against in ranked. What if there was a ranked queue that only solo queuers could join? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's fair to say that a group of random players are going to be at a disadvantage to a team with premades. Often this disadvantage makes the game no fun for people that queue alone, so why not make it so solo queuers could be put in a queue  with priority for games that don't have premades? </TEXT>
