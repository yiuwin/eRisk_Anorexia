	<TEXT> I tried using 2 vst amp sims so far and Ive had troubles. I just get squealing and I have two channels going at once my guitar into the direct input which is clean and the processed effect in the background and it is very low. So I have clean and distorted going on at the same time and the direct(Clean) is louder than the processed(Distorted). Someone said: The manual says "Connect a pair of headphones to the MONITOR OUTPUT 1/4" TRS jacks if you want to monitor the signal locally." That makes me worry that the headphone jack will always monitor the direct input no matter what you do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got An ART USB Computer interface/3 channel mixer and I am having difficulty's trying to hook my amp up to it to record. When I go directly into the interface with my guitar I get clean volume and the sound level shows up on the track , when I go directly into my amp and then out from my headphone jack on my amp into ch 1 input on my interface I get a lower volume and no waveform when I try to record. The device is set up right I just don't know why when I go in directly to my amp and then out into my interface its not picking up the sound on the recording program it just doesnt make sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it leaves the volume o the direct volume where I had it and I can hear the processed sound faintly in the background with squealing if I try and turn the effect up, then the volume completely goes away if I turn the gain down on my interface.
The first knob which is the gain knob controls the direct input of my guitar "the direct clean sound", the second knob ch1, ch2 , ch3, turns up the effects of amplitude but only when the first gain knob is turned up and the 3rd knob is turned up which is the Main mix volume.It starts squealing when I turn up the Main mix and The level volume and in order to even hear the guitar I have to turn up the gain knob. I have not tried to write to ART support, but what are they gonna do to help me? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot for the help. I have (hi z) On and the phantom power off. I installed the drive that came with the interface. ASIO4ALL won't mess up my interface or the driver that came with the interface "ASIO USB CODEC" that I have installed already for it? and should I uninstall the ASIO USB CODEC before I download ASIO4ALL? When I record on another program with just the interface the signal is clear and I have a clean guitar tone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I already changed the audio input to my interface but I am still getting the same problem. I changed the latency, changed the input to my interface and muted my comp microphone and it is still giving me the same issue. I changed it to my interface which is ART ASIO and I changed it to 48khz and tried 44khz cause thats what the interface said. What should my settings be for my recording tab and playback tab on my computer? I have a feeling that there is just one small thing I am doing wrong I just don't know what it is </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am having problems with amplitube and I would really like to use it. I am plugged in through a Art Usb Computer interface/ 3 channel mixer and I am getting feedback when I turn up the gain, the level and the main mix. When I turn up the gain and put on a distorted amp I can hear clean guitar and the amp distortion effect very faint in the background and it will just squeal and I hear crackling and popping. I changed the latency settings and I changed the other settings to the proper settings but its still doing it. I would really appreciate it if someone would help me, I would really like to try out some of the amps and effects. </TEXT>
