Zoos plus way too much, but they are at least vulnerable. If you stop Emeral they'll run out of steam very, very quickly. If you lock their extra, they are done for (Number 95 + Goliath does them in. You could play protect-the-Goliath). Chaos MAX is bad for them because their mons are weak. Board wipes are strong against them. Maxx "C" draws half your deck if they proceed, and if they don't, it's gg. Their monsters don't even have grave effects or float. Zoos are pretty much vulnerable to everything, except negation because they have way too many ways of summoning that Rat. The OCG backrow variant is annoying but every backrow deck is annoying; the more the backrow, the more annoying they are (looking at you Paleos). 

Of course that assumes you go first, or drew into Maxx "C". It's literally a dice roll against Zoos: go first or go bust. But at least you can win.

True King and any variation thereof are just impossible to out, even if you go first. Toad, Dolkka and Laggia are ok if there's one, but together, that kills you. Beast basically makes your power plays dead: soul charge, shrine, return, melody. Heck even Trade-in gets the chop. When I saw VFD, I seriously underestimated him. I just thought he was a slightly better DBarrier. After using him, he is just that much better than DBarrier. His 3000 atk is average (for Blue-Eyes anyway; it's the mode) but still huge for other decks, but his effect is pretty much Cold Wave on steroids for monsters. A field of those 5 guarantees a loss, and because Kings work by activating two or more effects at once, you can't even negate them. Tyranno is stupid: a book of eclipse and mirror force in one card is really bad. 

I don't think the meta is good, but I don't think it is the worst either. Certainly there are worse metas, like the Nekroz where they had the Djinn lock (really, what can they do without the Djinn lock?). Still, doesn't mean it is good.

It's still fun to play somehow. I see it as a challenge: defeat the board to win. Of course it's a hopeless challenge, but, if, by some protagonist style miracle you do win, it's an even better win.  Some metas allow for rogue decks, this one does not. Eventually a new meta will roll in, and it will allow for rogue decks while we still play Blue-Eyes. Blue-Eyes is surprisingly inventive as an archetype; there are so many different possibilities to merge the deck with other things, or to play the deck differently. 

For instance, I am currently trying out brilliant fusion shenanigans in two versions: TCG and OCG. TCG allows you to get two negates, a ritual monster or spell (I run one copy of Chaos MAX, and search chaos form. Melody does the rest) from Brilliant fusion and one of your lv 1 tuners.  OCG version bricks a bit less because I use only one Brilliant fusion, and use the predaplants instead. Then, using a hand of one tuner, Scorpio and a monster, I can pull off VFD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sage with Eyes of Blue:

*If this card is special or flip summoned, return one level 1 light-tuner from your hand to your deck. You can send this card from your field to the graveyard: If you did not target an effect monster: send an effect monster you control to the graveyard and if you do, special summon one Blue-Eyes monster from your graveyard.*

Maiden with Eyes of Blue:

*If this card is targeted for an attack: you can change the battle position of the attacker, then send one Blue-Eyes White Dragon from your hand, deck or side of the field to the graveyard. You can only use this effect of Maiden with Eyes of Blue once per turn. If this card is face-up on the field while a card effect is activated that does not target: You can send one Blue-Eyes White Dragon from your hand, deck or side of the field to the graveyard.*

	<TEXT> Hello.

Suppose I target, say, four monsters in my graveyard with soul charge, and my opponent uses cards to move one or more of my targets out of the graveyard (for example D.D Crow or Fiend Griefing). Does Soul Charge still summon the remainder of its targets?

I've checked the wikia and it says that it does, but two players so far on DB have said that it doesn't. 

So does it summon the remainder of its targets?

Thanks for answering. </TEXT>

Norden

Master Peace (pop a card version)

Bullhorn (Dridents are perfectly fine and they are easy to deal with. When you basically +4 off one summon, Drident is tough.)

Limited:

Ratpier (Useless at one, too good at two with the monster reborn Zoo)

Oviraptor

Diagram

Ghost Ash and Cherry Blossoms

Magical Meltdown (just for fun. Also, a semi-limit is kind of pointless because of terra)

Terrortop (way too many plays off that)

All the DRulers,even the babies.(because Blue-Eyes likes them, and 3 is too much to be good.)

Pot of Desires (Pot of Greed 2.0. and Pot was limited from the getgo)

Stratos (why is this still there? I mean 3 is too powerful, but at least 1 is good)

Harpie's Feather Duster 

Solemn Judgment

V.F.D (Effect doesn't warranty a ban. A limit should be enough to calm it down)


Semi-Limited:


Construct

Void Feast

Moralltach

Dark Armed Dragon

Maxx "C"

Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon (So long up there.)

Unlimited:

Victory Dragon (why is this even on the banlist? Just rule it illegal like the others)

Super rejuvenation

Ulti-Cannahawk (There's either something that I can't see with this card or it's just a stupid limit)

	<TEXT> The deck has difficulty making rank 4 which is precisely why I run Rat. In fact, Rat is essential.
In general, Rat is never going to be Normal Summoned. Instead, I summon him off Barrage or Terrortop. Then, I can use Bull to get Rat and Whiptail, normal summon Whiptail, and overlay for Emeral. The Emeral then uses its effect by detaching Whiptail. I overlay Tigermortar over Bull, and use Mortar to reattach Whiptail, and then overlay for Drident. 

That way, the field ends up with a Drident that banishes whatever it battles, an Emeral, and a Blue-Eyes, at the very least.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno. It doesn't brick as often as you'd expect. Besides, I've already explained the logic behind those cards. If it was a 40-card deck, then maybe, but it is meant to be 60. 

Also, I've been trying ratios for a year now, at least for the dragons. Felgrand and Arkbrave barely brick because you'll rarely draw them. More often than not, they are either in your grave turn 1, or you win by turn 5. Master is absolutely essential at two. At one I get him way less often than I'd like to. Two not only helps me get him, it also helps resolve his effect twice. And in this deck, the twice can come very often indeed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello. 

Ever had some really funny rage quits happen to you?

A good one was when I played a Darklord Burn OTK. Got to go first, and I open with the Windwitch engine. I end up with Crystal Wing. 
Guy draws through half his deck, getting rid of his hand and brings out Reficule. On my turn he uses Gift Card, Paths of Destiny and Tri-and-Guess. Exactly 8000 damage. Except ... he declared synchros for Tri-and-Guess.

Thing is, I was using a Zoodiac deck with the windwitch engine, which meant that my extra deck had only two synchros: Winter Bell and Crystal Wing. Which I had already summoned, so I had no synchros left, and he had one. He ragequit immediately. (As an aside, I always see darklord burners using one of each kind of extra deck monster, why is that? Can't you use just one kind?) </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-05-01 08:38:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello.

I made a Blue-Eyes Zoodiac deck. I got the idea when I saw that Zoos easily do a turn one lv 8 Grandsoil thanks to Bullhorn. 

Then I realised that Grandsoil is not searchable by Bullhorn, so instead I decided replace him with Emeral.
It's 60 cards just because as a principle, I always use 60 cards. 
Anyways, here it is:

**Monsters(32)**

* Blue-Eyes White Dragon (3) 


Obvious. Our lord and saviour and a true engine of destruction


* Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon(3) 


It's Blue-Eyes. He's very good for R8nk plays.


* Dragon Spirit of White (2) 


Cosmic Cyclone had a buff. Also useful because I never have enough BEWD in the deck.


* Sage with Eyes of Blue(3) 


* Maiden with Eyes of Blue(3) 


* Master with Eyes of Blue(3) 


Sage is standard. Master is useful from the graveyard or with sage: use sage, search master, get sage in grave somehow, summon master, recover sage, target with sage. You get Blue-Eyes on field, and a Master in grave. Maiden is basically a faster White Stone of Ancients. Also goes well with the field, and summons Crystal Wing. Besides, she is very useful for Blue-Eyes because she summons from anywhere, and I always run out of Blue-Eyes in my deck or graveyard. 


* White Stone of Ancients (3) 


Discard fodder. Summons Blue-Eyes from deck. Free +1. It's good. 


* Arkbrave Dragon(2) 


Makes Dark Matter Dragon go from good to great. Also, helps with the Dragon Shrines and Foolish Burial if I have no targets for Stone. I use two because I can use him for Dragon Shrine. 



* Amorphage Goliath (1) 



Summoned off Arkbrave and Dark Matter. Locking the opponent out of their Extra Deck is extremely powerful. More so when they have to deal with free destruction and 3k attackers. 



* Felgrand Dragon (1) 



If my opponent's deck is not extra centred, or if I want free plussing, I use him over Goliath. He can raise his attack as well as get rid of a monster, while bringing my own back. 




* Maxx "C"(1) 


Stops every single play my opponent makes, or gives me half my deck to counter them.



* Zoodiac Ratpier(2) 


The soul of Zoodiacs.



* Zoodiac Whiptail(2) 


Search target for Bullhorn. She also gives some attack for Drident if I want to OTK.



* Speedroid Terrortop(3) 



* Speedroid Taketomborg(1) 



Work in pairs to pull out Ratpier via Invoker.


**Spells(23)**

* Dragon Shrine(2) 


Foolish Burial x 2. Its great for setting up the graveyard. 

* Foolish Burial(1) 


Sets up graveyard. Useful for sending Master as well. 

* Mausoleum of White(2) 


It's seriously useful. If I have this and Sage in hand, then I can get a Crystal Wing. Otherwise, targeting Maiden, setting up the graveyard and increasing attack are a few other useful options.

* Raigeki(1) 


Lots of OTK potential. Why not use it well?

* Return of the Dragon Lords(3) 


Really useful. Deadly when combined with Goliath because he can avoid destruction. Makes the deck a lot less susceptible to field wipes. 


* Soul Charge(1) 


If I use this with a good graveyard, it's basically over already.


* The Melody of Awakening Dragon(3) 


Adds Alternative to the hand and provides a discard outlet. 

* Trade-In(3) 

Its a lv 8 deck. Trade-in adds draw power. 

* Twin Twisters.(2) 

Discard outlet and good for backrow. If I have stone in my hand, I can use this on my opponent's EP, destroy two cards, then banish a third off Spirit off Stone. 

* Where arf thou(2) 

It's good for searching out whatever Eyes of Blue I need. Usually Sage for a Blue-Eyes or 2. 2k damage doesn't mean much when I'm destroying you anyway. 

* Zoodiac Barrage(3) 

Good for bringing Ratpier while preserving the normal. 

**Traps(5)**

* Jar of Avarice(1) 

Recycles Ratpier, and the other Zoodiacs and Emeral. It's really filler, because I don't know what else to put. My Zoos don't need the recycling that bad.

* Solemn Strike(2) 
* Solemn Warning(1) 

Good traps that are staples

* Zoodiac Combo. 

If I ever need to summon Rat manually, I send this to the grave. More or less filler. 

**Extra Deck(15)**

* Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon 

* Black Rose Moonlight Dragon 

* Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon(2)

* Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon 


Graveyard negation is strong. The two synchroes are situation dependent. If I want protection, need revival, or simply want to tag Spirit out, I go for Azure. If I need disruption or I want Crystal wing, I go for Moonlight. 

Basically to get Crystal: Summon Sage while Mausoleum is on field. Add Maiden, summon her with the field, and target her with the field. Summon a Blue-Eyes, tune for Spirit, use its effect to bring Moonlight out, then tune for Crystal. 

Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn or Ancient Fairy Dragon is better suited for Crystal than Moonlight, but I want disruption and Extra deck is tight. 

* Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon

* Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon

* Number 95: Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon


A trio of cards: go into Tachy, pop a card with Armor then send 3 dragons off Dark Matter. He's too good. I use him to send Stone, Arkbrave and Goliath/Felgrand. That way I pretty much +2 while locking my opponent's extra deck, or I +2 or more with Felgrand. 
Also I don't use Cipher because my opponent may not have an XYZ and I like my battle phase. I am open to swapping them though

* Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy


Too good. By the time my opponent reads his name and effect, his turn will end. 

But jokes aside, I don't really like him all that much. Spell negation is strong, but he offers no protection. I'd rather have Felgrand or Heliopolis out. That way either I disrupt my opponent while protecting a monster or I OTK. Still, spell negation is not too bad. 

* M-X Saber Invoker

* Zoodiac Boarbow


* Zoodiac Broadbull


* Zoodiac Tigermortar


* Zoodiac Drident


* Daigusto Emeral


Zoodiac part of the extra. Basically use Rat to summon Boar, then summon Broadbull. Use Broadbull to summon Rat and add Whiptail. Normal Whiptail, go to Emeral with Rat. Use Emeral to summon a Blue-Eyes by detaching Whiptail. 
Then overlay Broadbull for Tigermortar. Use Tigermortar for Whiptail, summon Drident. 


Overlay that Blue-eyes with any other lv 8 (most likely Alternative), then go into Dark Matter. You end up with a field of 4 mons: one offering free destruction, one offering 4k atk, one that's just plain OP, and one that locks the extra deck. 


I play online so costs aren't a problem. Any suggestions, apart cutting out maidens and cutting to 40 cards are welcome.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Boiling point of solutions </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello. 

I'm trying to find databases that give the boiling points of solutions. 

More specifically, I'm trying to compare the increase in boiling point elevation for water solutions of Group I chloride salts. Essentially, some of the salt (from LiCl to FrCl) is dissolved in water, and I want to know how the boiling point of the solution will change if I dissolved, say LiCl instead of FrCl. 
However, I need experimental data for this. Does anyone know where I could find data on the boiling point of solutions?

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He definitely was compared to Lloyd George and Wilson.

The Treaty was too harsh, but at the same time it was not harsh enough. If it had been enforced, then there wouldn't have been remilitarisation. The Lebensraum wouldn't have occurred. If it had been less harsh, then it is likely that the Germans wouldn't have gone to war again.

	<TEXT> WWII started because the treaty was a mix. If the treaty had been a lot harsher, more importantly, if it had been enforced, then WWII would have not started. 

On the other hand, it is also likely that if the treaty was not harsh, then there wouldn't have been conditions that gave rise to extremism. The Weimar republic was initially hated, and it did have inherent problems in its structure, but Stresemann did rebuild Germany. Had the treaty been less harsh, it's likely that the Germans would have seen the republic in a better light (not a good one, at least at first, but better than they actually did). The Great Depression destroyed Germany, but it would have had less of an impact if Germany had had more domestic chances to recover. 

The reason there was no war after WWII was because the treaty was enforced this time. They also allowed better communication, and had both the USSR and USA this time round. The UN is also a lot more efficient than the LON ever was. 

The Treaty of Versailles failed because it was incomplete. It's like crossing a road: either you do it or you don't. If you cross midway and then hesitate, you die.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There were many problems in the formation of the Treaty. On one side there's an idealist in Wilson, and on the other there's a bloodthirsty, disillusioned leader in Clemenceau. 

USA never had much damage in the war, and even then, Wilson was forward thinking. He knew that if the treaty was so harsh, there would be a WWII, and he wanted to avoid precisely that. However, his position was weakened at the Treaty, because USA had nothing to lose. Furthermore, domestic leaders wanted to keep it this way because they saw Europe as stupid enough to start another war (they weren't wrong). Between Clemenceau, his own health problems, and congress, he lost hope, made too many concessions. He never recovered from Versailles. 

On the other hand, Clemenceau was the one the most affected by the war, because it was in his country that it took place after all. On top of that, France is just adjacent to Germany. They knew that if Germany ever had some warmongering urges, they would be the first in line; they were right. No wonder they wanted to crush Germany completely. Of course, creating such an environment creates and promotes to power extremist leaders like Hitler. But Clemenceau really wanted his revenge. He did get it: the workforce in Germany was gone, Germany went from being one of the biggest industrial countries in the world to absolutely nothing, they were stripped of their land, humiliated, defenceless. They didn't even get to listen to their own treaty. Incidentally, there is an official clause in the Treaty of Versailles that states that no country has the right to call any of their drinks Champagne, except France (And America because they didn't sign)

And Britain was caught in between the two. Lloyd George  wanted to punish Germany because that was what the British demanded, but he wanted to preserve Germany as a trading partner. He also knew that punishing Germany too severely would only lead to another war. Lloyd George's own quote summarises the treaty perfectly: "I think I did as well as might be expected, seated as I was between Jesus Christ and Napoleon Bonaparte"

And it's not like the treaty only screwed over Germany. It only set the gunpowder; the League of Nations was the spark. For starters, they excluded 2 major world powers so they had little power. So little they created a duopoly between France and England. They couldn't cope with Hitler's rise with their 'appeasement'.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was younger, I used to play a basic beatdown deck filled with basic monsters which had high attack. Naturally, Blue-Eyes is the star in such a deck because he has the highest attack of all normals. Since monster effects were weak back then, he stood out. 

As time went by, I met people who actually knew what the hell they were doing in the game. They introduced me to a whole host of new deck-types. Monster effects were picking up too, so the Blue-Eyes couldn't keep up. IOC reached here, and BLS and CED were monstrously powerful. So I played some chaos for a while.

The anime was still running here, and there was a God card rush. The Pyramid of Light movie came out, and Blue-Eyes Shining was revealed. I was smitten by its effects, which were pretty good and tried to run it. Of course, having a 4500 attacker in the Fusion Deck didn't hurt. I built a dragon deck that had no real theme, except that of type. It was terrible. 

I started playing online on DN, and I discovered a world I'd never known before; REDMD, the Chaos Dragon twins and the D-Rulers. It was a time of success for the Blue-Eyes, and I tried to incorporate them into my Shining deck, which of course failed miserably. I just removed everything about Shining and rebuilt a Blue-Eyes deck from scratch; it worked really well. 

After the DRulers got banned, Blue-Eyes got the shaft. I was mad that Construct was so good, and absolutely livid that Red-Eyes was getting new support which was so much better than anything Blue-Eyes had at the time. I was very happy when Construct got banned. I continued playing Blue-Eyes chaos, or Blue-Eyes disaster despite barely winning. 

I spent about six months in excitement because the DSOD was announced, which meant Blue-Eyes was getting new support. And what new support! Now I laugh at Red-Eyes like a Kaiba laughs at a Joey, because Blue-Eyes has the better support. And ironically, I pray that Construct returns so that I can play Blue-Eyes Shaddoll.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've tried Vermillion Dragon Mech. Blue-Eyes synchroes 9 easily, and Spirit is not always the best option.

It's destruction effect is useful when you are going for game, and it adds 2700 atk to an already impressive field. 

But Cloudcastle may be the superior option:

Summon sage, and a regular Blue-Eyes, tune for Spirit. Search for Stone with Sage.

Then in the opponent's turn, use Spirit's effect to bring out Azure-Eyes. Azure resurrects the Blue-Eyes in the graveyard, and then you can summon stone and tune for CloudCastle. Cloudcastle will bring back Spirit, and then you can overlay Cloudcastle with one of the two (usually Azure) to summon V.F.D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually made a deck just to annoy people. 

It basically ran 39 traps. Mirror force and it's variants, and Trap hole and it's variants. It ran the Solemn cards, and also ran the Horn cards, but you probably could replace a few things if there is no banlist. 

The last card was a Maiden With Eyes of Blue. It's funny how people refuse to attack her in fear of Our Lord and Saviour appearing, when you don't even have something to summon. And then when they finally decide to attack her, they find out you had no Blue-Eyes all along.

	<TEXT> In the same vein as Vampire Lord, any of the virus cards, except Eradicator Epidemic. 

So many things float when destroyed that the viruses basically become instant Gold Sarcophagi for the opponent. Especially Crush Card Virus, which was devastating back in the day, but has now become worse than useless post-errata. 

Full force and Devastation Virus can still accomplish something, but they still are quite bad. Metalfoes, Kozmos, True Kings, Lightsworns ... so many archetypes or cards love being destroyed so much they do it themselves. The viruses are just accelerating their deck.

Only Eradicator Epidemic remains playable, and even then, it's slowly losing playability because of floating spells and traps.  </TEXT>

Sage is good because he searches for any of the other With Eyes of Blue, plus any Ancient stone, or some tech stuff.

Opponent has 2 backrow: two Fiendish. Has 2 Judgment Dragons as well. I think he had 2800 LP or so.

I draw and topdeck Trade-in. I activate Trade-in, and draw just what I needed: Silver's cry, and D.D.R. I summon Redox, banishing the Blue-Eyes, and Tempest. I use Tidal's effect to add Mythic Water Dragon. I tune Redox with the Stone, adding a Blue-Eyes to my hand in the process, to make Scrap Dragon. I set D.D.R, and use Scrap's effect on it. Opponent chains Fiendish. I summon Mythic Water, and overlay to summon Dragluon. I activate it's effect to steal Judgment Dragon, But I'm hit by another Fiendish. 


Free of backrow, I use D.D.R to bring back my Blue-Eyes, discarding the Blue-Eyes I got via Stone. Then I use Silver's cry to resurrect that same Blue-Eyes. I overlay the two for Thunder End Dragon, use it's effect and attack for game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, raigeki is unbanned because it's effect had less of an impact at the time. It was released with Shaddolls, Nekroz and Burning Abyss. Two float well, and Nekroz was so consistent it would just do the same thing all over again next turn. Pends like Qlis laugh in the face of Raigeki. Plus, so many cards have in-built can't destroy/immune to spell/traps etc, that Raigeki is no more a guaranteed field wipe. 

It's still very powerful though. It baits negation, and in most decks is an OTK enabler. It's just that whatever it does doesn't necessarily warrant the banning. We've got 4 Dark Holes in TCG (Dark hole itself, and Kaiju Slumber), plus Raigeki and we don't see board wipes everywhere anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ps: I think Dragon's bind and Dragunity Darkspear switched locations. 

The main point in yugioh is to keep more cards than your opponent. The more cards you lose, the closer you come to losing. LP are less decisive than the number of cards both of you have, which is generally the number of cards in your hand and on your field. Graveyard effects can mess this up from time to time though. If you have 100 LP vs 8000 LP, but you have 4 cards vs 1, you'll likely win, especially with Dragons who can drop 8000 damage like it's nobodies business. On the other hand, if you have 0 cards, 8000 LP vs 100 LP, 4 cards, you'll likely lose. Also, note that the number of cards your opponent has is important. 4 cards from you vs 10 cards for the opponent is not easy. But if you and your opponent are sufficiently close in number of cards, the difference matters less. 8 cards vs 10 cards is not so different from 10 vs 10 cards. 

Keeping this in mind, there are a few cards that are either horrible or subpar in the deck:

Gandora the Dragon of Destruction. The effect may be powerful, but it's not worth the cost. To summon Gandora, you'll need to tribute 2 monsters. It's very difficult to find two monsters to tribute. Plus, for Gandora to attack and win, you'll need to banish a lot of cards or lower your opponent's LP a lot. In either case, if you are able to meet these criteria, you probably never needed Gandora's effect in the first place. Plus what if you tribute summon Gandora, and get hit by something like {{effect veiler}} or {{solemn strike}}? You've lost two monsters or more for nothing, and this can be game deciding. 

Gravi-Crush Dragon is pretty useless considering you have no continuous spell in the deck.

It's unlikely that you'll have Horus Servant and a Horus Dragon out together. The Servant is useless alone. 

Horus the Black Flame lv4 is kinda useless. 1600 is too low to do much, and battle destruction is quite slow. Horus lv6 is okish, but it's pretty bad in today's environment as well. If you had lv8, perhaps Horus lv6 would be worth keeping, because locking your opponent's spells is very powerful, but nonetheless, they really increase the chances of bad draws. They aren't something that go in any deck, they need a deck of their own to work well. 

Koumori and Luster Dragon are bad. Normals with low attack are not really worth running, unless you are using Hieratic dragons. The latter summon normal Dragons from the deck or graveyard when tributed, but reduce their attack to zero. 

Krystal Dragon requires battle destruction to work, which is too slow and anyway I don't see why adding a lv 8 Dragon is useful. Sure, you gain more cards, but then again, you'd rather have your dragons in the graveyard than in the hand, so if anything the effect is detrimental. 

Lord of D. gives nice protection, but suffers from the same problems as Horus's Servant.

Mirage Dragon is interesting. It's effect is decent, but there is probably something you could run over this. Besides, most decks in general don't run battle traps. Depends on your local environment though. I'd side it if I were you and wanted to keep it, but again there is most likely something better that you could use. 

Radius is not really that great. It works if you were running rank 8s, but you aren't, and even then, you could find something better. 

Napalm Dragonius has absolutely no purpose in here. 600 LP is too little to turn the tides, you can't get his second effect, not being able to use your own effects is terrible and not worth the burn, and he does nothing else for you.

Spear Dragon is not bad, but there are better things out there. The Dragon Dwelling in the Cave is also severely outclassed. 

Tiger Dragon is not completely useless, but the aim of your deck shouldn't be tribute summoning. I'd remove it. 

Vice Dragon is decent. You could actually keep it, but if you run out of space, you could easily cut it. 

A Wingbeat is a nice card with a very powerful effect. In fact {{Heavy Storm}} is considered to be one of the most powerful cards in the game. The problem is that it is situational; you can't pay the cost easily. Red-Eyes Darkness (REDMD) could special summon the monster back, but again, that's very situational. Perhaps you could keep one and test around with it. 

Mythic Tree Dragon has no purpose in this deck, unless you run some decent water monsters. Mythic Water Dragon is the best, but you'd need to run Rank 8s as well. 

Berserker soul needs its own deck to work. I mean you could pull it off in casual matches, but if it's a local tournament, you'd be better off without. 

Equip cards are considered to be bad in general, because if you lose the monster you lose the equip as well, so your opponent gets rid of two cards for the price of one. Black Pendant's 500 atk boost is not really significant. Same goes for Dragon Treasure. Mountain's boost is also insignificant. 

Monster Reincarnation is not that good, because you lose two cards (Reincarnation and the discard), and you gain only one (The monster). Again, your dragons are better off in the grave than in the hand. 

People don't tend to play monsters in defence anymore, so Shield Crush is not that good. 


Swords of Revealing Light is a stall card. Stalling is not great anymore, because it means that you were in a losing position if you had to stall. In those three turns, your opponent could simply build their field, and kill you. Besides, with the amount of available destruction nowadays, your opponent chooses when to end Swords, not you. 

The Flute of Summoning Dragon has to go if Lord of D. goes. Besides, even if you keep Lord of D., it will be very rare that you end up with both cards. 

Barely anyone tribute summons anymore, so Blast Held by a Tribute is useless. 

Castle of Dragon Souls is rather decent, but you could find better options. Really, the card is best used to banish {{Eclipse Wyvern}}, but you don't have the card in the deck. If you have space you could keep the card though. 

Cemetery bomb works best with a deck around it, otherwise you ain't inflicting much damage. 

Dragon's Bind is kind of lackluster. You need a Dragon on field to activate this, and in the end you might not mess up your opponent's plays. Also suffers from equip spell syndrome in that if you lose the dragon, you lose this as well. 

Lineage of destruction is also lackluster. Doesn't really work with the lack of lv 8s. Even then, that spot is better used. 

Tragedy is not really good. Better use other cards in its place. Similar argument against Tyrant Wing. 

Chaos Chimera Dragon is way too hard to summon, and it's effect is not even good. Since it's in the extra deck, you could keep it as filler since it won't stop you anyway. 


In a dragon deck, there are different ways of proceeding. The best dragon deck right now is a blue-eyes deck, but it's expensive and is based on a dragon, rather than being about dragons. 

Chaos dragons is an interesting deck that combines light and dark dragons, has powerful effects and large otk potential but poor recovery. The deck uses {{Lightpulsar Dragon}}, {{Darkflare Dragon}}, {{Chaos Sorcerer}} and {{Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning}} as chaos monsters. Eclipse Wyvern searches out REDMD or Dark armed Dragon. The deck generally uses Lightsworns to mill. Between {{Solar Recharge}}, {{Allure of Darkness}}, and the occasional {{Trade-in}}, the deck is very fast. You already seem to have a skeleton for it with the mix of light and darks, so you might want to try that. 

{{Dragon's Shrine}} and {{Dragon's Ravine}} are great cards for setting up your graveyard. {{Return of the Dragon Lords}} could work if you use level 7 or 8 dragon-types. {{Arkbrave Dragon}} and the Felgrand archetype work well with that.

	<TEXT> I'd rather keep cards the way they were before, and if need be, release a similar card with less broken effects. Having a banlist would become pointless if we just errata'd cards, and would also ruin the card's image. 

For instance, Ptolemaius was stupid, but the original idea was taken and applied to create the Dark Tellarknight whose name I can never remember. The nerf was probably a bit overboard, but it keeps the image of Ptolemaius intact, but allows him to be played anyway, in a sense.

Pot of Desires is another example. They took Pot of Greed, which is considered by many to be one of the most broken cards in yugioh, if not the most broken, and made a less powerful version. They sort of errata'd pot of greed, while keeping its image intact. Now while you still get a +1, you need to banish at the very least a sixth of your deck. 

Also, retro formats take a big hit. What if you are playing in a Goat Control format? Sure, you probably have copies of the cards lying around pre-errata, but cards have a finite lifetime, you have a finite lifetime, and the game does not. It's a retro format; it will exist well after your death, and people will be playing it, people who buy their first set of cards, with the new effects. It's likely the old effects will be documented somewhere, so you could refer to them during the game, but it's a big hassle. It's much easier (and more lucrative) for Konami to just break a branch off a broken card. 

Sometimes, cards get powercreeped so they may come off the banlist. BLS is an example.

Finally, Competitive yugioh has a history. Changing the effects of cards would be, in my eyes, obfuscating this history. You see Crush Card Virus in past formats, you see how people actually hated to be hit by it. Then you see current Crush Card and wonder how the hell people ever feared this card when it's pretty much a minus 5 for the one who used it (monster effects+ crush card + lost monster). While it's true that newer cards will make older ones look weak (like summoning 2800 atk and saying that's huge when decks can drop 2 3ks, 1 4k and one 2.5k monsters in one turn), changing the effect is different altogether.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've got different builds of the Blue-Eyes. I've been working with the card for years now. My main build is a Kaiju/Blue-Eyes/Infinity, which is where I use the Mausoleum. It's a 60 card deck because I tried I don't know how many 40 card variants, and they all did significantly worse than this. All of them without fail bricked every duel out of two. This one bricks rarely for some reason. I don't know how come a large deck works better than a small one, but this one works much better. 

I'm currently trying out a Galaxy-Eyes/Infinity/Blue-Eyes with the Goliath combo. Return of the Dragon Lords + Goliath + Dark Matter + Infinity = no chance. It's a very nice build that tries to turbo out 2 Blue-Eyes in one turn. Maiden is a goddess in this deck. I'm very fond of the Sage+Maiden combo. Gets you two Blue-Eyes in one go. In my experience, Maiden speeds up the deck, not slows it down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very busted indeed, if you put it that way. Then again, this one is a lot harder to get on the field. Once it does though, there's no going back. While it's harder to get on the field than Towers, it's not like its that hard to do with sage + maiden into Twin Burst. And Melody + Trade-in _ what ever else draws in Blue-Eyes makes it rather easy to get in hand. 

It's an extremely unfair card, and I'll be the first to admit it. It's definitely more busted than the above comparison makes it seem to be. The card is meant to be this powerful however, but Konami shouldn't make it. As much as it would boost Blue-Eyes into the stratosphere, it would pretty much ruin the whole game. I'm fooling around with this card design.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see. That's an interesting way of running crystal wing. Normally I use the field spell plus sage. Depending on your hand or field, you can search ancient stone or maiden with sage. normal one of the two, and tune into spirit. Use spirit to summon a level 7 and tune that with the remaining tuner.
If it's an empty field, you search Maiden, use the field spell on her and summon a Blue-Eyes. If you have melody or alternative in your hand, SS Alternative, search stone, NS stone and tune again. This gives you a blue-Eyes at the end of the turn plus an alternative for you next turn by banishing stone. 

Because extra deck space is really tight, Blackrose Moonlight is the goto card for me. I'll try the Ancient Fairy combo though. Sounds interesting. Thanks.

	<TEXT> Invoked Blue-Eyes decks sound interesting. I've tried my hand at one (basically a splash of Aleister, the field spell and the fusion, in a ratio of (2:3:2)) but found it to be much less powerful than my Blue-Eyes/Infinity/Godzilla deck. Always ran out of steam early.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's true. A classic board would be Dark Matter, Radiant and Goliath with Stone and Alternative and Return in grave. That means that you have to deal with Radiant without your extra deck, and even if you do, by some miracle, manage to get rid of it, you'd have to deal with at the very least a 2750 atk, 3000 atk with effect destruction and 4000 atk field. The chances of you winning is nigh. 

Of course, I'm just fooling around with this card design. It's way, way too broken to be ever made (Let's just hope that there will not be a day where this is not broken). If this card was actually made, full power DRulers, full power DAD, full power Nekroz, would be like playing normal monster beatdown against this. 

One can always imagine though. I would be very happy if a toned down version of this was made. 

The point about common handtraps in Blue-Eyes is interesting. I haven't used many in my best build, which is a Blue-Eyes Kaiju deck. Only used Maxx "C", and only one at that (when it was semi-limited). I tried effect veiler, but found that it wasn't really doing much. Ghost Ogre in side though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The negate the summon effect could be baited out with a lot of difficulty. You either get to negate the summon or a spell or a trap. 

The negate one card on the field effect is not a quick effect. That would have been just too powerful. Currently the card is really weak, better keep it that way ^(/s)

But under ideal conditions Lightning could get rid of it. Only under ideal conditions. R4nk spam could get rid of it. Two Lightnings and it's bye-bye to Radiant. Heraldic could do that. Raidraptors too. Probably ABC and others as well. You can't negate both Lightnings's summons at once. You'd need God's hand to get rid of it though, and even if you did, you'd have to invest 5+ cards in doing so while your opponent invested something like 3 cards, likely with a prime graveyard.  </TEXT>
