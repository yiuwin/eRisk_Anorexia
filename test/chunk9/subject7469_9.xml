	<TEXT> That is amazing, but it does sound familiar to me that we (sydney) just keep having the same issues coming up again and again, if we want a true global city we need to address our public transport issues here. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Totalwarhammer: Free DLC not downloadable? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-27 00:44:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok this seems to be a weird redirect issue.

I recently got the humble bundle and am enjoying warhammer total war.

I go to download the free dlc's from the steam page and it launches the game.

If I am in game on the main menu, it will prompt me to add DLC's which is fine, I go to add them and it opens up  a steam browser window which asks if I have steam installed to DL the dlc's. 

Clicking on the "steam is installed" button seems to do a whole bunch of nothing.

What the fuck is happening here?

Also, which paid DLC's are worth buying in your opinion? </TEXT>
