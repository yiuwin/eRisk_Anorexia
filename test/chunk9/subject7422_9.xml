	<TEXT> I've heard that poor air quality and mold can lead to nightmares. Any recent flooding or plumbing issues at home? If they occur anywhere she sleeps then you could possibly rule that out, but if they only happen while she's at her house then I would check into that. And you might say if she has this problem wouldn't everyone else in the house have it too? Not necessarily, everyone's biology is different. What effects her might not effect everyone else. </TEXT>
