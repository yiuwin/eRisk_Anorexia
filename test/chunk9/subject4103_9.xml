	<TEXT> Would not surprise me one iota. The concept of marriage has in popular parlance become such a diluted and misaligned caricature of itself that we practically need to invent a new word to describe actual marriage. Of course, considering that we're still using the same definition of marriage that has been in use since modern English was a thing, if you ask me it's the rest of the world that should find a new word for their state-recognized emotional/sexual relationships. But the modern world is nominalist at its core and thinks that concepts like marriage are not objective but rather have whatever definition we give them, so I don't see this working. Future historical studies will have to clarify what older cultures actually meant when their records mention "marriage", but I suppose that's been the case for plenty of other things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't move the goalposts. Your line of argument was that since being gay is something people are born with (which is still not known), that God must have made them that way and therefore it's good. I provided counterexamples to that by naming things that people are born with that are clearly not good. Whether something is a trait a person is born with has no bearing on whether it is a good trait. The "born this way" defense was always a red herring. People are disordered, and have disordered impulses. This applies to everyone, but for some reason people want special passes for their own favorite sinful tendencies, whatever they are. Sin does not depend on the amount of mental distress or physical harm an action causes - that is the belief of modern secular humanism and bears no resemblance to Christianity. Pedophilia when acted upon may cause more emotional distress to the parties involved, but homosexual sex is also gravely sinful, even if nobody is "harmed" in a secular sense.

Pope Francis said "Who am I to judge?" as part of a greater statement about possible homosexuals in the clergy. He prefaced it by saying that as long as they were following God (i.e. living out their celibate vocation) then there was no problem. There was no reference to homosexual sex or pretend marriage anywhere. You can pretend he's just towing the line, but literally every statement he has made on the topic has been in line with the Church's teaching. Those "brave men and women" you speak of are simply called heretics, and their heresy will die as all heresies have done. The Church will remain, and new heretics with new ideas will come forth.

Jesus taught love, but not tolerance, nor mere "acceptance". Jesus taught that marriage was between a man and a woman. He went so far as to say that the very existence of male and female is the reason for marriage, echoing the words in Genesis. Love is not about simply letting people act however they want and do whatever makes them feel good. Love is about willing the good of the other. That means bringing them closer to God, which often involves a cross and a denial of self, just as Jesus promised us. Heaven is very exclusive - you can't get in carrying even a small shred of sin. Jesus doesn't want anyone to stay where they are - He wants to enter our hearts and transform us into the perfect people we were meant to be. Hell, on the other hand, is very inclusive. The devil wants everyone to stay where they are and not change a thing. Don't forget that Jesus is also God, who is seen throughout the rest of the Bible and in the history of the Church. What the Church teaches is what Jesus teaches. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If God didn't want people to have sex with children, why did He make some people pedophiles?

If God didn't want us to beat each other to death, why did He make some people with violent tendencies?

If God wanted the heart to pump blood, why did He make some people with a weak heart or a heart with only three chambers which can't do that?

You seem to have missed Christianity 101. We are a broken and fallen people living in a broken and fallen world. Not all of our natural impulses and inclinations are good. We have a tendency towards sin. We are sinners in need of a Savior, who is Jesus Christ. That is the foundation of Christianity, and the Catholic Church. It's not some social club for people who want to feel good about themselves and make the world more materially comfortable for those in it. We are to do good and avoid evil, and often that means suppressing our natural inclinations in favor of what is right and just, and not just what makes ourselves or others feel good.

And by the way, Pope Francis is not on your side here:

"as for proposals to place unions between homosexual persons on the same level as marriage, there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to Gods plan for marriage and family.

It is unacceptable that local Churches should be subjected to pressure in this matter and that international bodies should make financial aid to poor countries dependent on the introduction of laws to establish marriage between persons of the same sex (AL 250-251).

"Christian marriage, as a reflection of the union between Christ and his Church, is fully realized in the union between a man and a woman who give themselves to each other in a free, faithful and exclusive love, who belong to each other until death and are open to the transmission of life, and are consecrated by the sacrament, which grants them the grace to become a domestic church and a leaven of new life for society (AL 292).

As a Cardinal in response to Argentina's plan to incorporate gay "marriage" into law, he wrote: In the coming weeks, the Argentine people will face a situation whose outcome can seriously harm the familyAt stake is the identity and survival of the family: father, mother and children. At stake are the lives of many children who will be discriminated against in advance, and deprived of their human development given by a father and a mother and willed by God. At stake is the total rejection of Gods law engraved in our hearts...Let us not be naive: this is not simply a political struggle, but it is an attempt to destroy Gods plan. It is not just a bill (a mere instrument) but a move of the father of lies who seeks to confuse and deceive the children of God.

	<TEXT> The stance of the Church isn't medieval, it's Eternal. Sex is intended for the Union of a married man and woman ordered toward procreation. Anything contrary to this, be it homosexual activity, premarital sex, contraception, is gravely immoral. Marriage is a structure meant to safeguard this unique relationship. If people did not procreate via male/female couplings, marriage would look very different than it does, or wouldn't exist at all. In a species that reproduced asexually, for example, there would be absolutely no need to give a marriage relationship any special designation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tolerance is the position of those at a disadvantage. When public opinion was still heavily swayed against homosexual relationships, they were only asking for tolerance. Now that the majority is on their side, and history/progress/whatever "has spoken", it's those who live by religious convictions that have to ask for tolerance. In reality, we know we should do good and not tolerate evil. We just disagree about what those are. Everyone wants the law to reflect their own moral values, be they Catholic or secular humanist. True freedom of religion was always a legal fiction, since there will always be a religion with beliefs or practices that go against the culture. For a few hundred years, we were able to get away with it since people's beliefs were similar enough overall, and the differences could kind of be passively ignored. Now, however, the differences between progressive secular thought and traditional religious teachings are so fundamental and massive that they will always be legally in conflict and irreconcilable. Considering that the culture and the law behind it has been increasingly secular/progressive and shows no signs of stopping, we should be prepared for everything from ridicule to legal action for living out our beliefs, unless we confine them to a single building for one hour a week. If we're even granted that privilege. </TEXT>

Edit after reading the article: it seems that as usual, the majority of the allegations come from 40 or 50 years ago. It's practically impossible to determine the truth or falsehood of any claims at this point. Local dioceses we bleeding money over this and about to declare bankruptcy, so the allegations come pouring in.

	<TEXT> Okay, no. This is the sort of thing that makes people misunderstand and hate the Catholic Church. This child is not a monster, but an image of God like the rest of humanity. Unfortunately, in this case they seem to have a false perception of their own sexual identity as male or female, and internally identify more with the other sex. This is an issue of fallen nature, but it does not make the child a monster any more than a false belief that he or she is a tree, or a teapot, or the Queen of England. The thinking is certainly disordered and must be addressed properly and not encouraged, but none of that makes the child a monster any more than the rest of us are with our fallen natures and concupiscence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, I was just making sure I wasn't giving bad information. I've never seen a Church teaching that states we absolutely must incorporate societal gender norms so long as we are not intending to present ourselves as the opposite sex, but I was curious if such a thing existed. And she's really less of a friend and more of an adopted little sister, considering our ages. Once she's grown into an adult she'd probably make a cool friend to have though. As for the anorexia, luckily she was receptive to help and went to a day center for recovery Monday through Friday for a few months. Had to take time off school, but I'm very glad she was getting help. She was still seeing a therapist when she left, though I'm not sure if she still is. Her parents don't have much money and I'm not sure if their insurance covered it. She wants to be healthy though, which is a big help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been wondering, with all of this hither and yon about transgender, genderqueer, agender, etc. etc. if we had any hard and fast rules about the way we deal with each sex and how they ought to present themselves. I know someone, for example, who has been struggling with her femininity since many traditionally feminine things don't resonate with her. She doesn't like pink, enjoys wearing shirts and ties, typically prefers pants to dresses, etc. I'm pretty sure that she doesn't think of herself as trans, since she does like some stereotypically girly things like makeup, pretty clothes, and some dresses (like Victorian style), and has never indicated any belief that she's actually a male, but more that she has trouble seeing herself as wholly female. She goes back and forth with what she likes depending on her mood. I basically told her that none of that stuff has any impact on whether she's male or female, but rather just societally imposed norms that may statistically be more likely to be associated with one sex. Whether she likes typical girl things or typical boy things doesn't affect that she's a girl.

What I'm wondering is whether we have a clear delineation between essential and accidental qualities of males and females. I told her that it only really matters for issues having to do with reproduction and the family. For example, sex, marriage, and a child having a mother and a father. It seems like that's what's essential, and other parts are accidental which could change based on the individual. I'm hoping I'm giving her the right advice. She also is attracted to both sexes, which I think muddies the gender waters a bit for her. She accepts the Church's teachings on sex and marriage for now, but it seems very tenuous and mostly based on not wanting to abandon the Church. She also doesn't think she'll ever want children. All that being said, she's still very young at only 16, so she's still got a lot about herself to figure out. She has some body image issues to work out as well, including battling anorexia.

I'm just wondering how to best encourage her with embracing her femininity while still staying true to herself and the wonderful person that God made her. Is there an optimal balance bewteen essential qualities of the sexes and societal norms that we should try to maintain? Does anyone have any advice for this type of case? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The worst (and by that I mean most horrifying, not most logically unsound) arguments I see are the ones that either acknowledge the fetus is a human or dismiss it as irrelevant. These usually revolve around the principle of bodily autonomy. While a person does have the right to bodily autonomy, up to a certain point, this right can be superseded by something greater. A person could be quarantined against their will, for example, if they had a deadly contagious disease, even though they are blameless. I also notice that the typical person who uses bodily autonomy as an argument for access to abortion also believes in mandatory vaccinations.

If preserving your bodily autonomy requires you to kill an innocent human being, you do not have that right. Murder (in the moral sense not the useless legal one) is always impermissible under any and all circumstances. Not to preserve your bodily autonomy, not to preserve your life, not to preserve the world from destruction. Evil can never be done to achieve a good end.

This line of argument also assumes that a mother owes nothing more to her child than any random person off the street. Given how the human organism reproduces and gestates, a fetus absolutely has the right to its mother's womb and nutrients for the duration of the pregnancy. People like to talk about rights and not responsibilities. A mother has the responsibility to care for her child (a father also has a responsibility to care for the mother and unborn child during the pregnancy, and subsequently after the birth, but that's not what's being discussed). Whether or not the mother intended on conceiving, either through rape or a misunderstanding on the purpose of sex, they still owe their child care. Luckily we live in a world where people will step in after birth to fill this void if the parents are unable to provide it, but the natural course is for parents to provide it.

 A child has a right to their natural mother and father, and this should only be superseded in extreme circumstances, and never at the expense of the child's life. As of now, only the natural mother can provide a suitable environment for gestation, so they are morally required to do so. Not all duties and obligations are ones we obtain voluntarily. Sometimes they are thrust upon us unbidden, but we are no less bound to them. Unfortunately we live in a society that values personal freedom and choice above virtue, and people aren't willing to make universally binding moral declarations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the other responders so far aren't directly addressing OP's question. Clearly Mary did have a choice to assent to God's will or to resist it (unless you're a Calvinist), but what OP is asking is whether or not she could have prevented the Incarnation if she had denied God's will instead of accepting it. Or, to put it a more crude way, would God have forcibly impregnated Mary with Jesus if she did not want Him to?

I think that this is an interesting question, since by resisting God's will she would have no longer been without sin, and thus an unsuitable vessel for the Incarnation. At the same time, God's perfect foreknowledge means that He knew that she would be perpetually sinless and would thus assent. So yes, if Mary had said no, the Incarnation would not have happened, but if she were going to say no then God wouldn't have asked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They didn't have a word for gay marriage in the same way that they didn't have a word for four-sided triangles, in that they both describe something that doesn't exist. Marriage wasn't about "two people who wuv each other vewwy much and want to have a party to show everyone", but rather a real ontological relationship between a man and a woman for the purpose of having and raising children. Being "in love" could have been part of the package, but it was by no means a necessity. 

There are also several parts of the Old Testament where the debauchery of nations is expressed by how they exchange natural passions for unnatural ones, and then go on to say that the men were having relations with men and the women with women. This sort of behavior is used to describe when a nation fell away from God and followed their own appetites. Paul was likely specifically calling out instances like male temple prostitutes, since that was what was prevalent in his era, but the Jews already knew that sex outside of a marriage was wrong and didn't need to be told. It wasn't part of the new revelation of Christ, but something assumed so blatantly obvious that it didn't need restating. 

So whether they had a word for a gay person, I don't know, because it's not important. What is important is the behavior. And extra-marital sexual activity has always been condemned. Pretending two men or two women are married doesn't make it real, and doesn't change the sinfulness of the acts. </TEXT>
