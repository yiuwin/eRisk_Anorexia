	<TEXT> I am not sure that it's from Cutthroat Island. I saw the trailer and found none of the scenes from the clip. Thanks though :) What about the Le Chuck character? It looks like it might be from some music clip. Too bad they didn't make a Monkey Island movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean its very popular series among adventure gamers. Why companies are ignoring us for almost 10 years now? Almost every LucasArts adventure has a remake by now and there are still no sign of Curse of the Monkey Island remake. I would love to play another adventure of Guybrush Threepwood mighty pirate (TM). Disney please give the IP rights to Ron Gilbert or Double Fine. Pretty please... with sugar on top (TM) :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good for you. I regret buying it. Played only one game and never touched it again. Civ 5 is much more entertaining. It has better pace and is definitely more polished. Also the graphics suck. Hopefully it will get better with the expansions.  </TEXT>
