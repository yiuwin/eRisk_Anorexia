	<TEXT> 1. Bipolar 2, Borderline Personality Disorder

2. 20

3. School -- well, not really. Pretending to school while stalling the drop out. :(

4. Taking my medication consistently, managing the aftermath of an emotional experience (particularly sad things), little-to-no communication with a doctor, I hate everything.

5. Sometimes I think that Bipolar doesn't have anything on me and that I can superman my way through it. Then I realize I'm just hypomanic and I need to calm the fuck down. So, a lot. 

6. Crippling depression, heightened anxiety when I cycle (about 3 weeks to a month, generally), a series of good things happening can turn me into a euphoric energizer bunny that makes shitty decisions to reverse those good things that happened. 

7. Have a regulated sleep schedule, get into regular therapy sessions, join a formal support group, take another look at my medication and its effectiveness. Generally.. being responsible and proactive.

8. I have a pretty good support system. I have great friends, whom also experience similar disorders and mental issues. My father (who is also bipolar 2) is a great resource for help. 

9. See number 8: Friend and Father. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn, this is rough. I'm sorry!

1.  I would suggest not texting as much and talking via phone calls. It might sound kind of weird to only communicate with phone calls at first, but it is much more effective, and what is the point of communication that is only ineffective and makes you upset (ergo hurting the relationship)?

2.  Therapy. :)

3. *Communication*. Work on communicating effectively **especially** when you are in an freaking out and all over the place. Take a few minutes to figure out your thoughts, breathe, figure things out. Stay calm when you are talking. Effective communication is a great thing that takes lots off work, but it sounds like you have a nice guy there is who willing to work through it.

tl;dr  
Way less texting, therapy :), with work slowly but surely communication gets better.

	<TEXT> I normally cycle around a month of depression followed by a short hypomanic stage. It's pretty hard for me to cycle up just by random everyday events, but I can cycle down into depression nearly instantly. 

Edit: To answer the question, a good nights sleep can help me recover from depression immensely. So does eating healthy and exercising. All three of those things help quickly, but have WAY less problems if I stay consistent with all three.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lots of times band shirts can be for both boys and girls. When I lived with my parents I could pass off getting girls bad t-shirts. The sleeves are shorter, and it fits in a much more feminine way. Bright colors are always a good thing to look for as well.

It can be a little harder for Jeans. I wear skinny jeans so it is pretty easy for me to just wear girl skinny jeans instead of guys without much of a problem. The biggest thing you want to look for are jeans that aren't very baggy. 

If you ever need anything or want to talk, feel free to PM. I think it is very brave for you to do this at such a young age! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are all SUPER proud of you for starting to figure yourself out at such a young age. It's really sad that parents and other older people won't let us be who we want to be. 

Here is my advice: Start trying to wear bracelets and stuff like that. They don't have to be girly, just start wearing some accessories. It is a LOT easier for parents to let you get kinda sparkly bracelets and stuff after you've worn masculine jewelry for a while. It's kind of easing them into it, you know? 

Lots of times parents will freak out and think it is something that they are doing wrong, so they want you to be like all of the other boys. They just love you and want the best for you. Keep on being you, and remember, 

YOU ARE PERFECT JUST THE WAY YOU ARE, NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS!! :)  </TEXT>
