	<TEXT> How cold is it there? Is there a draft coming through the window? I wouldn't say they look completely dead...having killed enough of my wife's plants while she's out of town I've become better at spotting these things.   
I'd find a new spot or maybe put a towel at base of window to stop any draft and then start watering them once every day. Maybe a little life left in them yet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You most definitely can. It's been a long time since I was in the Bahamas but we had no trouble finding it. More recently I've visited New Orleans, Montreal, Dallas and New York. Every trip I've been able to find some my first day there. Waiters and bartenders are the best to talk to.   
  
Maybe repost with a question more directed at people living in or having just visited the Bahamas. They might be able to  point you in the right direction.  </TEXT>

Some drivers just don't want to deal with that hassle and the ride gets terminated on their end. There may be some sort of repercussion on the UBER end for denying rides, I don't know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I only knew about him until after he died and that's probably a good thing  
  
So you've had a whole 24 hours to come to the conclusion that he is a mean person. 
This argument isn't very good.   Try actually looking at videos of his, appreciate that this humor was coming at a very different time in history and try not get worked up about entertainment that you personally don't like. Andrew Dice Clay is "mean". Rickles was a talented comedian.

	<TEXT> No. Hannity is criticizing Obama for saying that the US should be involved in Syria. Which contradicted the GOP stance at the time. He was also criticizing Obama for playing Golf. This was several years ago.   The irony is that Trump has spent a lot more time playing golf than Obama ever did and has now launched attacks in Syria.   That's the context.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From my personal experiences with Muslim communities, the whole Dog thing is a little convoluted. There are teachings in the more strict Islam communities that see dogs as dirty animals and should not be kept. However there are several reasons why you would need a dog (protection of land/property, herding sheep, companionship) which does not conflict with the teachings of Islam. I've known Muslims who owned dogs and treated them like family and others who want no contact with dogs.

	<TEXT> I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal  
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual  
A step-by-step booklet for you to get  
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back  
Rule Number Uno, never let no one know  
How much dough you hold cause you know  
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially  
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up  
Number 2, never let 'em know your next move  
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?  
Take it from your highness  
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips  
Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy  
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up  
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck  
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up  
Number 4, I know you heard this before  
Never get high on your own supply  
Number 5, never sell no ~~crack~~ weed where you rest at  
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce!  
Number 6, that goddamn credit? Dead it  
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!  
7, this rule is so underrated  
Keep your family and business completely separated  
Money and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch  
Find yourself in serious shit  
Number 8, never keep no weight on you!  
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too  
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me,  
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police  
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen  
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'  
Number 10, a strong word called consignment  
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen  
If you ain't got the clientele, say "hell no!"  
'Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow  
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up  
If not, 24 years on the wake up  
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up  
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed  
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks  
She sniffed a whole half of cake up  
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up  
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Show me one thing Hillary Clinton has said or done regarding politics since Trump's inauguration. I won't hold my breath since she's been pretty much incognito since then. Funny that you'd suggest she 
go off into the woods  
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/16/has-hillary-clinton-100-days-since-lost-free-world-donald-trump/  

since that is about the only news story I can find about the woman since the election.   
  
The difference wasn' that mitt Romney had the good sense to go away. It's that Obama had the good sense not to follow him. What happened there was actual democracy. Campaign, Debate, Win election, then move on to governing. Trump doesn't know how to govern, so he instead reverts to the campaigning party which is fun and you get to throw shit at everyone and anyone who disagrees with you because there's something to be won and something to be lost.   
I'm sorry but finding reasons to compare Trump to Hillary at this stage is pointless. It just doesn't matter.   
  
Trump supporters have forgotten that now that he's been elected and is the president that he is subject to criticism and rightly so! That's the job. You should be happy your candidtate won but that doesn't mean he gets a free pass. Now is the time to be hounding on him to make sure he fulfills all of his promises and doesn't destroy the country. You guys should be all over him like flies on shit for what he's currently doing which is playing you (us) all like fools.   
  
I'd be delighted to give up reading or caring about opinion polls on them. But they're not holding up their end of the bargain.  
  
What bargain did you strike with Hillary? Did you get it in writing.  Stop reading fucking opinion polls about Hillary Clinton and then you won't have to read about Hillary Clinton.  </TEXT>

What exactly is she being judged for? I haven't heard much from her since she lost the election. Why do we still need to do approval ratings for her? I don't remember anybody talking about Mitt Romney's approval ratings in March 2012. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the US we Admissions people would be very hands on with our students and guide them through the whole process from A-Z. Counseling kids on majors, minors, campus vs on-campus living was such a natural part of my job that I assumed everywhere was the same.

I think this illustrates the overall conclusion ITT that foreign colleges and universities aren't viewing their potential students as customers to be swayed into buying their brand of education, unlike the US system where the colleges are trying to win prospective students over.

	<TEXT> Yea that's an effective but sometimes tedious way to get around. My major gripe is with people who insist on left turns out of parking lots across 3 lanes of traffic. Dallas is built on the idea of U-turns so why they don't just take a right and make a U-turn 100 yards down. I do this and I see people still waiting to get out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think the absence of nuclear weapons means they aren't a world power. They are arguably the most influential Muslim country in the world. The mere geographical location of Turkey makes them a major player in world politics.   
So can they extend influence world wide? Yes absolutely. They've taken a huge role in dealing with Syrica, Iran and Russia. Any of the decision they make regionally will impact the world in a whole.   
  
I'm not Turkish. I'm not trying to get karma, just pointing out that Turkey is in fact a major world player.  </TEXT>
