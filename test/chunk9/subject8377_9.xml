	<TEXT> Oh that's awesome! There are 'plenty' of allied health jobs in QLD and WA, only problem is my partner has a sponsorship from Pfizer in Sydney (I think it was Pfizer?) and has to work for them for 5 years after he graduates. Not many jobs rural for a biomedical engineer :(  But eh, nursing isn't so bad. Not my passion, and I will have to go back to uni for advancement, but it pays the bills and I can work wherever I want and not shove bulk billing forms in disadvantaged people's faces. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, artificial serotonin can have side effects, but I meant the mechanism is essentially like fixing up a vitamin deficiency. People have this notion that psych meds mean you are crazy, that they are a sign of shame and crazy or that they even make you crazy. With a good psych the whole concept is like taking a vitamin </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't a PhD project, it looks like an honours project or master's pilot study. If you finished the test you would find that at the end it asks for demographic information like where you are from. 

The questions are not loaded. They are actual statements and beliefs that some people hold. And yes they are cliches. That is literally the point of the study - they are analysing these stereotypes and cliches. That's their job and that's what their research in the past has done. Also, they aren't homophobic, they are presenting homophobic and sexist ideas that are common in the LGBT community as well as straight community stereotypes of us. They are asking us if agree or disagree with the statements. In other words, if you think the statements are bullshit, say so! THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SSRIs are natural. We make serotonin, but we can become serotonin deficient. It is essentially like taking a multivitamin.

I have actually been strapped to a gurney and force fed medication in a hospital. Because I was dying and I was psychotic. If it wasn't for the doctors and nurses there I would be dead at 18. Now I've completed an honours and a Masters degree and work as an OR nurse and speech pathologist. 

Doctors are qualified in helping you. If you don't want help and want to be paranoid, then fine. But you already have a record and if you refuse treatment, it will show that you refused treatment which will reflect much worse than if you sought treatment, which will only kill a large number of employment opportunities </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What people also seem to forget is that despite the high interest rate, it was far easier to pay off a home at that time because wages began to quickly rise and interest rates quickly fell. My step family bought a house with a 15% interest rate and we're told it will take around 25 years to pay off. They did it in 7 years because that interest rate came down and the wages increased dramatically during that time. We have stagnated in terms of wages and housing prices just keep rising. Relying on interest rates to determine if the market is worth tapping into is a fallacy if you are going to spend a disproportionately huge amount of money on a property.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes deceit isn't intentional. Sometimes people are so worried about being a certain way they can't see that you will still accept them. Unfortunately, we are still at a place where being not-straight can be life altering in a bad way. Let him come out in his own time, he might even be straight, but pushing him, and telling him that his perfectly legitimate fears of coming out are unacceptable is unfair. 

Honestly, none of what you said in your post is at all an indication of him being gay. Until he tells you, you can't know, and just have to deal with him telling you he is straight. If he ever comes out as otherwise, react however you please as it is perfectly legitimate to act out when we feel our trust has been violated or we are lied to, but still. Relationships are built on trust, and if you can't trust his word, then well... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the 'new' comes from how they have conceptualised it and are using a well known theory, but are showing it in mathematical notation. 

While I haven't read the full journal article, this is a lot like computational psychology - there is a fully documented trend, and as a result there are particular theories. To test these theories, simple formula are created to explain the theories and evidence mathematical such that if we were to run a simulation of the phenomenon it will show what is happening in the data and what certain manipulations of particular modifiers can do, but also to simulate evidence based predictions where we can manipulate modifiers.  </TEXT>

At this point, I think you're the one who is nitpicking making a big deal out of something that involves such a minor change which could improve his chances of not only getting this through peer review, but also to make interesting, informed correlations.

	<TEXT> The program at UNSW is also triple accredited like QUT - EQUIS, AACSB and of course, Australian accreditation. I didn't study business or commerce there so I can't comment on the quality of the program. But UNSW has a thing called the Co-Op program which is essentially an internship program that you can sign up for, they also have a tonne of careers fairs and industry training programs. I am fairly certain there is also industry experience provided as part of the course. 

Very few people I ran into didn't study business or commerce at UNSW lol. I can say that the student admin and student services are great and that lecturers and professors are very approachable and helpful. There is quite a culture about assisting students and making everyone comfortable so they can do well. This I feel is one of the most important factors for deciding upon a university - if the university doesn't make you feel valued or doesn't try their best to provide quality services or to help you, then really you wasted your money. There are tonnes of universities out there, and at the end of the day they really all offer the same degree especially from the sample of universities you suggested. They are all good, but they do all have varying levels of student satisfaction and student support services. 

But be warned. UNSW has stairs. And it has lots of them. ;) Also, while ANU is a good choice, it ranks highly because of science, which isn't what you are interested in. UNSW ranks highly because of business/commerce and engineering.  To make it easier for you, just click [here](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2016/business-management-studies) and sort by region (Australia) :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone with a psych degree from a top 10 university in the field, dreams literally mean bullshit. They can be twisted amalgamations of your memories and your feelings, but they aren't trying to tell you anything and they typically are not indicative of anything you don't already know. This concept of the subconscious is really exaggerated. In fact, it is actually debatable whether a subconscious mind even exists and rather we simply exhibit different levels of consciousness from the same modality of consciousness. The topic of consciousness is interesting, but faces the problem of being extremely difficult to measure - rather scientifically we treat subconscious either as relying solely on the limbic and prelimbic system or as a background consciousness which has limbic activity (instinct, mood, satiety etc). This is why subconscious is associated with hypnosis and marketing as it supposedly appeals to our basic needs which implicitly makes us interested in a product. Then again, there is also more research arguing a counter to that.

But dreams are bullshit.  </TEXT>

I do not know recall what this is called (my last psych class was 3 years ago after all), but it is similar to H-OCD and I will not be surprised if maybe you have anxiety. You may not necessarily tick all the boxes for a diagnosis, but the feelings you have may eventually lead to it. Mental illness and conflict is progressive after all. Best wishes. 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It wasn't too bad. You need 8-10 sessions, potentially less if you do electrolysis but the session times take longer. It does hurt, it's equivalent to being stung by something really hot and pointy, but the pain lasts as quickly as it comes and goes away pretty much immediately. The only downside to laser is you have to shave between sessions, which is hard to do, so electrolysis is probably a better option and I would have gone that route had I known better.

I get you. I really do. Though I look more Asian. I got my butt hair lasered off as a courtesy since I like getting my ass eaten. But the whole lack of facial hair and body hair...it's what guys who date Asians are expecting. I kind of wish I hate the body hair so people would stop assuming I'm femme or submissive and treat me like a regular guy rather than someone seemingly inferior. 

As for your butt hair...well there isn't a whole lot of porn with guy's with hairy butt's. After all, guys on Grindr are looking for that pornstar experience </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have yet to meet a minority 'throw themselves' at a white guy. If they do, they must be in the far minorities, and I am saying this as a POC. Although I will say that people have asked me why I married a white guy and they probably are thinking I'm with him because he's white and he has a fetish for Asians. Which isn't true. He was the first white guy I dated, I primarily dated black and Indian guys and gravitate towards them on Grindr, but am open to screwing anyone who can hold a conversation. 

I think it's a stereotype that POC want to date whites. Because I'm seeing more POC dating each other. Hooking up on the other hand may be different because they never hooked up with a white guy but want to. I also find it interesting that if POC want to date white people they are 'throwing themselves at them' but what about all the white people with no blacks on their profiles, are they doing the same? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And, as someone who's studying a field based in science, being able to critically think and use skepticism to weed out the facts is incredibly important. Please exercise that muscle!

I agree, as someone with a science degree. However, what is sad is that a lot of critical thinking has been removed in curriculum for courses like engineering and business/commerce. Essays in my opinion are fundamental in every discipline, especially independent essays where students need to source their own material for a topic. So imagine my surprise when my friends in engineering complain about a 1000 word essay where the only thing they need to reference is the same textbook and provided sources, while I'm sat there writing 3000+ word essays checking journal impact factors and looking up the academics to check for unsavoury associations for sources I found on my own. This was considered normal and quite easy for us psychology and neuroscience kids, but the engineers struggled and I can guarantee none of them left their degree with an appreciation for honest research and evidence, but rather that essays were stupid and so was using google scholar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love men with dark skin. I'm currently fanning myself over Sam Okyere. 

I will say though that in general, yes being POC will lead to less dates mostly because of the negative stereotypes in media (emasculation of Asian men and the 'all blacks are thugs' for example) and because we are constantly told societally that white is good and the rest is bad - that only white people can be regular, normal folk. 

I could write a thesis on my Grindr if I wanted to. I'm half Asian, but I look more Asian than Russian. When I tell people I'm half they say shit like I'm now 50% fuckable or 'oh that's why you're hot!'. But if they just thought I was only Asian I get the whole "You're hot, for an Asian." or the "You're too Asian for me. Sorry." or "I don't fuck guys with small dicks."...and no I never sent them a dick pic...

Dating sites and apps are meat markets and the people on there are so picky that systematic racism takes over. You'd have better luck in real life

	<TEXT> Sure. But the definition of drag is to turn a male body into a female body. Perhaps the definition has changed with time, but this is why so many transwomen turn to drag for comfort. When cis women infiltrate this space, it's almost like an ignorance to the concept of transformation and gender politics. 

Maybe it's just because I've talked to many transwomen who feel a little hurt by the idea of bioqueens, but I get where they are coming from. I also get that anyone can do drag and have it be legitimate, but I think drag, with it's roots in fighting cisgenderedness and LGBT issues, should be reserved to be capitalised and celebrated for those who aren't ciswomen. Or maybe I'm old fashioned and dumb and need to update my thinking. Who the fuck knows! </TEXT>

Drag has its roots in the LGBT community and was lead by gay men and transwomen. To take away from that is taking away from what drag is - transformation into a woman.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly! I think gay men do also put a lot of pressure on themselves to be 'normal' and normal is that hyper masculine guy who doesn't like fashion and loves sports. There is like this fear of being put into this box when you come out where everything you do from this point forward is because you are gay and not because you are a normal guy. Which is sad. For example, I'm a professionally trained ballet dancer. Been doing it since I was 3, when people find out they think I developed that hobby because I'm gay, same goes for me playing the violin and I can't like nice clothes without it being because I'm gay. Literally anything that isn't hyper-masculine that I do, is reduced to me being gay and not me being a human being with you know, tastes. But then the fact I regularly hit the gym is now a gay fact of mine and even mundane things like enjoying cooking and getting regular hair cuts. 

We still have a long way to go as a society to really break down stereotypes and just let people be people. It's suffocating to force others to show they aren't just a label and that they really are normal like everyone else </TEXT>

With that pornstar - his problem isn't that he said he has a preference. It is that he made a sweeping statement saying that all people who were not white were unattractive. A better, and more honest phrasing would be that he hasn't come across a POC he has been attracted to and that he happens to be attracted to white guys more so.  </TEXT>
