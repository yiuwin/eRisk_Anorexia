	<TITLE> Rudy Gobert's Last 10 Games: 19.3 PPG, 14.2 RPG, 3.9 BPG, 2 APG </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Rudy's performance this year has been incredible. He is the motor and heart of this Utah Jazz team and seems to get better and better every game. 

Having watched a lot of Rudy play over the last 2 years, I never would have imagined he could put up these types of numbers over a 10 game span. 

Last year, Rudy's hands were terrible - he couldn't hold onto the ball to save his life. This year, I think most fans have forgotten how terrible his hands were, which is a testament to how much he has worked to improve his game.

 ****Edit:**** I forgot to mention that Rudy has been doing this on 69% shooting.

	<TEXT> Hey r/travel

I just discovered a website that lets you know about error fares and cheap flights called [Pomelo](https://www.pomelotravel.com/flightalerts), so I thought I would share with you all! 

They are similar to Secret Flying, but they send you emails of cheap flights near you. They have paid options, but I just signed up for the free option because I am cheap (which is why I was on this site in the first place). I thought this might help someone out there find a cheap flight and go somewhere they might not have been able to otherwise! 

They are also doing a ticket giveaway right now for 2 free tickets to either Europe or Hawaii, so if you want a chance to win tickets, you can do that as well. 

Keep on traveling.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all,

Is it possible to mass export account info from multiple Facebook ads manager accounts? 

I have multiple ad accounts under my business manager and I want to export all the data together instead of individually downloading it for each ad account. It would be a big time saver.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We spend a lot of time talking about the terrible actions of Trump, but I find very few comments that talk about actions we can take to make the changes we want to see. Our words have to be backed up by action.

What are some realistic actions that we can take within our own neighborhoods and communities to start the grassroots movement and make our country the place it should be?

I want to see a collective Reddit brainstorming session on this. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Scriptural Literalism In The Church </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just finished listening to a podcast talking about biblical literalism given by a retired Episcopal Bishop and found it fascinating. 

This topic has been on my mind the last couple of months and as I read through the Bible, particularly the Old Testament, I wonder how much of it is meant to be literal and how much of it is meant to be an interpretive portrayal to help us understand God's love for us. 

I am just curious what peoples thoughts are on the scriptures literalism vs. being an allegory to help us understand points of doctrine. </TEXT>
