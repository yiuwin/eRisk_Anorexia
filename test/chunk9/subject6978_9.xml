	<TEXT> Story time.

Last week I was standing outside the store I work at organizing a few things. Guy passed by, we looked at each other. I kept doing my thing. Guy went to ice cream shop next door, got some ice cream. He then walked by the store again, heading to the direction he came from before, and we smiled at each other. I turned around and walked a few steps back to go into the store and then looked behind me. He was looking back too, we smiled at each other again. Less than a minute later I walked back out to continue the work I was doing outside, and he was walking again towards me, this time he came up and we talked and exchanged numbers. 

We webt out twice since. So far we've had a very good and special connection, the kind I haven't felt in my life. We talked for hours. I'm happy we looked at each other in the eyes  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First time I post here

The good:

-went back to the gym after around a month and a half of a break since being "diagnosed" and bradicardia that finally stopped. Doing weights again feels good! Also some cardio

-upped my calories to about 1400-1500

-hunger signals are back! This is so weird. I hadn't felt hunger in weeks

-enjoying the kik group very much


The bad: 
- I still skip meals sometimes when "given the option" (example: at work and I don't eat lunch there or when I get home)

-I started enjoying cardio for the first time... Probably because I feel I'm purging the extra calories I've been adding.

-I would like to get off my meds. Prozac and something for anxiety at night

The ugly: 
-since I've been feeling better from eating more lately, my family and some people tell me I look better and healthier. I associate it with being fat. It makes me feel like I'm gaining weight and I want to glue my mouth shut and never eat again. But now I'm back to being hungry which is supposed to be a good thing, and now I'm a hungry cow who eats 1500 calories and I feel fat and bloated and ugly and I want to restrict so badly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thankfully my entire family is involved and they all make sure I'm eating enough. I upped my intake a lot in the past two weeks. Today I ended up going to the gym and doing some basic things and I felt perfectly OK actually so I'm pretty happy about that. I will try my best to fuel my body. I want to be OK and I'm really trying hard. Hopefully with all the people I have around me I can manage to get out of it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This! Exactly the reason I want to lift. I'm a perfectionist in nature so if I get into lifting agaib I will want to do it right and see progress, which would make me eat again. Also when I got into it first time it really slowed down my ED things  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My anorexia isn't so bad. Some might even say its not anorexia. Bmi is 18.5 in my lowest, and I never fully stopped eating like many people do. I just had that issue with the heart rate but now its OK.

Basically I didn't discuss what kind of exercise with my doctor, but she knows that I used to lift and we talked about going back to the gym. She just said to take it slow. 

I wish my team was an actual team I could rely on for more regular check ins but its not. My family however is very much involved. My mom is a doctor and she agrees that I might benefit from going back to exercise

Fortunately I was NEVER the type to exercise as a way of purging and burning calories or torturing myself. Opposite rather. It always made me feel better and like I deserve a chance at a healthy life. When I had to stop working out it really made me go downhill... So I think emotionally and mentally it'll be good for me even if I have to take it slow

Thank you for your honesty and sharing your experience with me </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right. 

My calorie intake right now is between 1200-1450. My short term goal is just to be active again because it is good for me mentally. Long term, I'd say I want to feel healthy and energetic again.

Technically I'm in treatment. It's not the best kind of treatment but its my only option as of now. I see a psychiatrist who prescribed Prozac to me, but she's not there for talks. I also see a nutritionist who made me a plan. She wants me to gain weight. I manage to only do a few of the things she said.

The thing with my ED is that I didn't hit so low. My bmi is 18.5.  Barely underweight. The only issue I had was with the heart rate. But now I'm eating more and it is solved. I think if I feel hungry from lifting it actually might ease me into eating more, because I wouldn't feel so guilty and I would feel like I deserve food.

I really appreciate you taking the time to write and comment. Believe me you helped me with perspective </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Request: help figuring out a gym routine after eating disorder </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-19 17:07:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was diagnosed around a month ago with anorexia nervosa and was forced to stop all exercise because of very low heart beat. I started my recovery and now I got cleared to exercise again! I'm so happy because it helps me with stress and depression.

Before my eating disorder escalated, I was at around 111lbs (5" 2) and I was squatting like 70 lbs and deadlift like 80lbs, bench press 45 lbs. I'm sure I won't be able to lift so much now. It's been a month since I've worked out and now I weigh 103lbs and I lost quite a bit of muscle mass and I can tell I got weak.

So I just need help figuring out what kind of lifting program to go for. I feel like I'm pretty much a beginner again. I think it might be best to go for a full body routine 3 times a week. 

What should I do? Any advice would be very much appreciated. Whether you have experience or not, I'd still like to hear thoughts on a good basic program to gain my strength back for a month or two.

TL:DR: lost weight and muscle mass after ED escalated, want to get back to lifting but need help figuring out a routine. </TEXT>

You are right about lifting and the gym. My problem is that the ED keeps saying gaining muscle is ugly...... I need to snap out of that 
My biggest motivation is college. I will finally start my degree mid October and I MUST be well by then. Thank you for all the reminders.
My lack of hunger is due to a lot of disgust, and fear that I will enjoy the food and want to eat a lot (even though I never had a binge) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are SO right about exercise. I was actually lifting until about two weeks ago, I kind of stopped because it's been so hard for me lately with the low calories, the extreme summer heat we've been having and also longer hours at work. But the rational person in me knew I could faint while working out so I didn't. I do agree with you that it's amazing for depression, and also really helps motivate to eat! I love lifting, and I know I need to eat healthy to sustain it and progress.

Friday was a better day for me. I actually was at work still fasting and had to climb a very high ladder to take down a heavy lamp and I almost fell, I was so lightheaded and weak I couldn't do it without help. After that incident I told myself, OK subject6978, if you want to keep wyour job and also survive life you need to eat. So I ate. I actually ended the day at 1100 calories which I hadn't for around a week now! That was good. I focused on getting healthy, unprocessed, "safe" foods I cooked and measured and counted myself. I know counting is still ED behavior but for now it helps me reach higher calorie goals since I can't trust myself with portion sizes

I have to admit that at night while in bed, I had the typical ED inner dialogue... Guilt, fat shaming, planning another "successful" fast... Looking in the mirror and just being disgusted. I tried really hard to snap out of it. I hope I'll manage.

Thank you, even writing this helps me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I constantly tell myself that I'm OK and I can decide when to stop restringing whenever I want, but now I can clearly see that I can't, and its just the ED talking, pretending it'll let me go and stop hurting me. I understand now that this is a part of having a disorder, a weird denial that on the one hand is positive because it gets you motivated to recover, and kick the ED in the ass, but on the other hand, stalls recovery because you're not aware of how bad you're doing.

I actually don't have a treatment plan yet. I went on Tuesday to an eating disorder clinic where I met the psychiatrist and also a nutritionist and I filled up a whole bunch of different questionnaires that I guess were there to have a more accurate diagnosis. I'm supposed to get a call from the clinic soon, to see how we proceed. I'm actually super anxious, they haven't called and its Friday afternoon... So they won't be calling now for a few days with the weekend. I'm really curious to see how we go about my recovery. 

The psychiatrist already suggested I take antidepressants but I refused that day. My family are all still trying to convince me to take them, since it can improve my emotional state and also reduce the panic I have of gaining weight, and maybe I could follow the nutrition guidelines better with their help. I'm still considering. Any thoughts on the subject?

Any help is appreciated, thank you very much for taking the time to respond </TEXT>
