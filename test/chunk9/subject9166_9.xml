	<TEXT> A similar thing happened in the second season of the Indian version of this show. The question was "What hair cut do Navy recruits have to wear?" and the options were in that case, genuinely confusing. "Crew Cut" was the correct answer but the other options were like "Navy Cut" and 2 more similar hairstyles.

The guy used all his lifelines. He called his son, who said he didn't know. He 50-50'd it, and then used the audience choice. I shit you not, the audience answered wrong. The dude went with it and well...bye bye. Apparently the jackasses had actually been polling the audience. I had always thought it was a guaranteed answer.

After that season they made sure the audience poll never returned a wrong answer. Also added a lifeline which guaranteed you the right one. Can't find the YouTube link to it, sorry guys :( </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys. Wanna buy Moto E3 power which is 7,999 but apparently Amazon and Flipkart hate us bhaiyas so we can't have deliveries over 5000 rupees. Any way to get by this rule? Do any other etailers have it in stock? I couldn't find any from a cursory google search. I live in Lucknow, if that helps. Gonna go out in a couple of days to check if any brick and mortar stores have it. Thanks for the help!

EDIT: My problem is solved. Apparently my friends living on the other side of the city can get it delivered. No idea why my address is invalid but you know what, I'm not curious enough. Thank you, /u/A_Dhobi_Reader and /u/slayersc23 for helping out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those aren't instances of wands connecting, just your usual action movie energy beam on energy beam duel.
I say that because this energy beam warfare is just in the movies. 
Wands connecting has a pronounced effect, like we see in the graveyard with Harry and Voldemort. Voldemort could NOT have mortally hurt Harry, his wand wouldn't allow it, no matter how hard he tried. And the connection started revealing his wand's kill history.

That was the only instance in the movies of wands connecting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The travelling by boat question does have good reasons that aren't theories:

1) Apparating over long distances increases chances of splinching aka not all your body gets transported. Think Ron in DHP1.

2) Newt was basically smuggling a magic zoo in. Muggles were easier to fool than magical customs I expect. JKR tweeted this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kimi No Na Wa or Your Name, by Makoto Shinkai. It's already earned an absurd amount of money and a spot in the Oscar for Animation considerations.

I've only seen one Makoto Shinkai movie before this, 5 Centimeters Per Second and Your Name does bear some echoes of it. Your Name is really beautiful. At first the plot kind of seems generic but that changes very soon. Loved the movie, really. I need to binge all of Shinkai's works soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to go with Spider-Man 2. So they know what an -actual- superhero movie looks like, instead of by-the-formula Marvel flicks and whatever the fuck DC is doing. 

Love that movie. Honest, good movie about Peter choosing to make personal sacrifices that no one asked him to make just to help people out. My favourite superhero movie to date. Inspires me even now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw the movie last year. I'm Indian and the movie moved me intensely. Kinda surprised to find out it was supposedly liked among neo-Nazis. Didn't the movie damn the entire culture of hate? I think people missed the movie's message. 

On a sidenote, never knew the Terminator 2 kid could act so well. He shouldve done more movies. </TEXT>

Went to an ATM in front of CMS Gomti Nagar at 10.20 pm and withdrew 1900 in notes of x100. 

Apparently some ATMs have been restocked for the night, might as well check them out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always wondered how pretty [Noor Jahaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur_Jahan) actually was. So beautiful apparently that the Mughal Prince fell in love with her even though she was a married woman. She eventually rose to almost control the empire in his stead. There's a hell of a one night stand if I ever knew one.

Fun fact: It was her niece Mumtaz Mahal for whom the Taj Mahal was built.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same with me. And it kills me to not be able to say it. I know my mum needs to hear it. I know she'll be gone soon and I need to get it out and tell her but I feel like Neo when Smith just makes his mouth disappear. 

NGL it's my parent's fault though :/ Coulda been a little more expressive with their love and made me more so too. </TEXT>
