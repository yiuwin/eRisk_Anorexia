	<TEXT> Yeah, for sure. The first time I tried reading it (a year or two ago?) I was under the assumption that it'd be less character-driven. Now that I have a more accurate representation of the book, it's much easier to appreciate and simpler to get immersed into. Which also made things really uncomfortable as they ever-so-slowly spiraled out of control.

	<TEXT> Oh. I was thinking something along the lines of them being right in the middle of the uncanny valley, but if it's plot related, I look forward to finding out why! 

Simmons has done a really great job on the Bikura. Either they're supposed to be subtly and increasingly more creepy or it was just inadvertent, both possibilities are really cool.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Bikura in Hyperion... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Having gained more of an interest in scifi as of late, I've been re-reading Hyperion (made it to someplace during Kassad's story last time before getting distracted with something else). 

This might just be me but the character arc of Father Dure is very... unsettling. I've read a bit of horror and a bunch of things over on r/creepy, but nothing has been quite as scary as the Bikura and their tendencies, so to say. Did anyone else get a similar feeling? And if so, why? Because I have yet to figure it out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Staying in Victoria (from Toronto) because of school, though I do make frequent trips to Van. This sounds pretty fun!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as I hope you're right, what makes you think it's monthly till the end of the year and only a couple-month hiatus? It's been quite the opposite for the past way-to-long.

	<TEXT> If memory serves me right, Miura has some of the more general plot-points planned out beforehand but he fills in the details as he goes along. For example, he knew he wanted Guts to be angry and impassioned with hate, so he went with it. The Band of the Hawk and the romantic plot with Casca weren't planned, rather,  they were a sort of whimsical inclusion which fit the original hate-filled protagonist theme well. 

Miura just happens to be exceptionally good at this writing style. That's not to say that it's flawless; the first panel in Berserk which shows Guts sex'ing a demon is *very* out of character for him given the backstory which was subsequently developed. 

And someone else has already pointed this out but the examples you've used aren't foreshadowing. [This, on the other hand](http://imgur.com/wIUAZ6E), would likely be considered an example.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would hate to get rid of a vast majority of my books but ones which I've lugged around with me would be Tigana by GGK and The Name of the Wind by Rothfuss. 

Recently moved to the other side of the country for school. Brought Tigana just because of how much I love the book. Brought Name of the Wind because it helped me get close to my romantic interest. Most other things are still just sitting at home haha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair enough. I found that insanely high as well. Looking at just the on-sale price it's still a really good deal.
