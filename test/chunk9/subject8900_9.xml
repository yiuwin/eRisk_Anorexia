	<TEXT> i really understand and most of all respect the sense of community, when is well understood and free, of course. I mean, as any social group the sense of belonging is quite reconforting. I personally don't need any church to now right from wrong or to act in consequence, also I consider there are many things within the Christian Church that are wrong. The Bible itself is heavily redacted, and you can see how they left out Thomas' Gospel because it didn't fit their narrative, when, in my opinion, is the most beautiful of them all. Still, I could talk about this for hours, I find it very interesting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I truly don't understand that someone studies the Bible and still believes that the message make any sense. I can understand feith and I have nothing to say about someone who truly believes and can't help it as I can't help not to believe. I also study the Bible and though I think is quite an interesting piece of literature and a fascinating sociological document, the contradictions are too extensive for me to be able to get a clear message. Sometimes I debate with believers and Bible experts and still don't get it. They usually argument that sometimes is literal and sometimes is a hidden message under the scriptures. I mean, if I was really a believer I would literally believe in everything the Bible says, and if so, most of the Bible is inaccurate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Historically, Jesus could had been saved by the Jewish Sanhedrin, specifically when Poncius Pilate (Judea's governator) ask them if they wanted to liberate Jesus or Barrabas, a known thief. The Sanhedrin chose Jesus, and Poncius Pilate didn't quite understood the choice and so he said. The problem was basically that Jesus represented a menace for the Jewish, they considered him a revolutionary, because his teachings advised that the Jewish religion was getting corrupt (as for example he advocated for more justice toward the woman, who were heavily discriminated at that time). The romans didn't care too much for Judea at that time, it was a distance province without much political weight in the central administration, but for the Sanhedrin, it started to get dangerous as more and more people followed Jesus. Is interesting that Jesus didn't declare that he was God's son until he was almost 31 years old, and even then, he was pressured to do it, and didn't open admitted so. The first time he did it was to Herodes, and it was because Herodes said: "You claim that you are God's son", and Jesus answered: "Is you who are saying that, not me". So, in a sense, he had to die because he was a revolutionary and this was to destabilizing for the Sanhedrin.

	<TEXT> Wow, this has been super helpful, thank you very much. One question, I've just bought [this](http://ordinaries.com/product/rdn-niacinamide-10pct-zinc-1pct-30ml) but I think is not as effective as what you mention (I found several articles about what you mention and it seems to be effective only together). The Olay cream is very expensive, is there any cheaper option that you are aware of? 

Again, thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello,
I've been dealing with PIH for a few months. I have been using Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid since last summer but I've just run out and I don't know if buying it again or if I should purchase another type of exfoliator. Do you have any advice? I have very oily skin, acne prone and I'm Spanish, so mediterranean, olive skin.
I would really appreciate some advise, thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dermatologist prescribed me [this](http://www.isdin.com/eng/products/isdinceutics/k-ox-eyes-eng), she told me that vitamin k is very effective for dark circles and they seem to be clearer after 1 week. For the bags, when I wake up with them, I use a gel eye mask (the one you put on the freezer) for a a couple of minutes.

Edit: I also use vaseline over the eye cream to retain moisture, it was an advise a redditor gave me. </TEXT>
