	<TEXT> To start the discussion, here's a quick summary of my piece:

John D. Rockefeller was a controversial industrialist, most infamous for monopolizing the oil industry. But lumping him in with the other "robber barons" of the era does not suffice; Rockefeller was also a groundbreaking philanthropist. In my essay, I try to reconcile these two conflicting views. I argue that Rockefeller was probably a constructive force, but that this was a chance outcome that could easily have gone the other way.

	<TEXT> Downvoted. Speed reading is bullshit, for one simple reason: the purpose of reading is NOT to *process* as many words as possible, it's to actually *understand* something that someone else has written.

Of course you can "read" at 800+ WPM if you want to, in the same way that you can listen to a sped-up recording of someone talking, and make out all the words correctly.
But doing that makes you spend all your cognitive efforts on *parsing words*, as opposed to actually trying to follow the narrative. As other commenters have duly pointed out, speed reading kills comprehension.

Besides, reading by itself is fast anyway. When I'm trying to read, 90% of my time is spent thinking about the last paragraph, maybe looking up a word I didn't know, or making a note about something. If I were to double the speed at which I actually processed words, I'd save only a very small amount of time (5%). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Billy was a bright young chap, but not so bright that he was black-haired. He was a darker-brown-hair-than-most-but-not-all kind of guy, perfectly respectable, not intimidating.

One day, much to his surprise, Billy got laid off from work. A couple of weeks of moping around in the house and doing nothing ensued, but eventually he decided to pull himself together. He started by cleaning. While he was scrubbing the floors, he accidentally spilled some bleach on his head. After carefully washing it out, he realized his hair had become a shade lighter: he'd gotten a blonde strand. 

At first he was embarrassed. Then it dawned on him, and he promptly covered his hair in bleach, and washed it out. Solid blonde. He bleached it again. Lighter yet. After a few more cycles, he'd gone to platinum blonde and beyond: his hair was white as snow. 

He walked outside. Neighbors gave him odd looks. He got into his car, and a passer-by yelled "are you sure you should be driving?" Billy's plan worked: the rest of the world perceived him as a complete imbecile, perhaps the dumbest man alive. He applied for all possible disability grants, needing only to point to his head as evidence of being totally unfit to take care of himself. He even went on TV, marketing himself as the dumbest man on the planet. It was easy to keep up the act; he didn't even have to talk. He could be drunk in public, and nobody could tell! 

Life for Billy was great at first, but the novelty wore off. The fame became less appealing when Billy realized that all his "fans" looked down on him. There was little he could do about this without coming out as a liar, an idea which gave Billy great anxiety. Similarly, Billy was unable to enjoy his gained material wealth in any meaningful way that wouldn't blow his cover.  The terrible secret that he was hiding confined him to loneliness. He thought he was a smart man pretending to be a great fool, but it gradually dawned on him that he was not smart enough to extricate himself from his life-consuming act. Billy had unwittingly, through a lack of foresight, committed an inescapable folly. Every day he dyed his hair white, and so he couldn't see the effect his great mistake was having: his real, natural hair color slowly got lighter, month by month...  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Extremely Fine Ballpoint Pen </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-25 12:38:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been looking for a particular ballpoint pen for a while, and I wonder if you can help me out. Essentially, it looked like a regular Bic Cristal Stic, except that it had an extremely fine point. 

Unfortunately I've lost the pen, but [**here is a picture**](http://i.imgur.com/h3fCCV5.jpg) illustrating the fineness of the point: in red is the pen in question. In blue is a [Bic Cristal Stic 1.0mm point](http://a.co/0qVW1rE ), which [according to Bic](http://www.bicworld.com/en/products/details/7/cristal) writes at a line width of 0.4mm, so judging by the relative line thickness of the red pen, it appears to write at a line thickness of about 0.2-0.25mm. 

Note that I am very specifically looking for a/any *ballpoint* pen of this thickness. 

It is easy to find equivalently thin *rollerball* pens, but they're not satisfactory. Rollerballs usually use a liquid/"jetstream" ink, which gives it a nice smoothness, but the ink usually comes out quite thick. The problem with this is that when you're writing on thin paper, e.g. annotating paperback books, the ink from a rollerball/fine-line pen comes out so heavily that it is always visible from the other side of the page, which can be very distracting when trying to read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I looked into this further. You're entirely correct that Edifier speakers are available on amazon.cn for roughly half-price. I tried ordering some speakers via amazon.cn to a US address, but it wouldn't let me. Evidently some other smart cookie has thought of this already, so the folks at amazon are preventing it.

You could solve this by using a remailing service (ship to an address in China, they then ship it to you in the US) but that seems like a hassle, and it's probably going to be more expensive than the potential savings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could it be that Jetski action scenes are simply indicative of a director who doesn't know what they're doing? Any experienced director will have had the exact same thoughts as you -- Jetski shootouts are both boring and unrealistic -- and consequently leaves them out. Consequently, only total blowhards put Jetski action scenes into their movies, and it's no surprise that such movies are generally poorly rated. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Avoiding Head Injuries: Protective Headgear </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-12 08:53:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm in my early 20s. I figure-skated for a few winter seasons in the past, but now haven't for a few years. The reason why I stopped skating was because one winter, during maybe a hundred hours of skating, I fell and hit my head three times. There are two things that suck about falling on your head:

1. Cuts, bruises, etc. For example, if you fall on your chin, the skin there is thin and cuts and scars easily.
2. Traumatic head injuries. Smacking your head on ice and getting a concussion is no joke.

Now that I'm thinking about starting skating again, I'm worried about head injuries. Any non-expert who skates regularly is going to hit their head some times, it's inevitable. Hitting your head on ice comes with the risk of a concussion, which can be quite dangerous. Though it's a low chance, if you do skate regularly enough, it's going to happen. I want to avoid that.

Consequently, I've thought about wearing a helmet and using some kind of chin guard if I'm going to start skating again. Chin protectors are no big deal -- you can hide them under a scarf. The real trouble is that wearing a helmet on ice would make me look like a dork, so I've been hesitant, and looking for subtler options.

I'm curious about how other people are solving this problem. Do you skate with protective headgear? What do you use? I've found a few options:

- [Ribcap](http://www.ribcap.ch/en/shop/) sells thick hats with protective padding.
- [Crasche](http://crasche.com/products) sells hats that are not quite helmets, but offer some protection.
- [Ice Halo](http://www.icehalo.com/) has developed a kind of thick headband to absorb falls, which they also sell integrated into some hats ([example](http://www.icehalo.com/product-details.php?id=267)).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is really insightful. I think it's true that the initial artistic acclaim usually comes from having some particular, unusual perspective combined with technical skill, but as the artist becomes successful, that perspective fades. (Why?) Instead, the artist starts focusing more on the *abstract* questions that are necessarily raised by extensive interactions with their medium. </TEXT>

Wait a moment, this actually kind of makes sense so far. Does anyone who know the franchise better than I want to comment on this?

Above all, it suggests to me:

- Heiman will not last
- Cartman will undergo one hell of a fall from his current position, but he'll remain with the Danish (Empire). Maybe he'll become some kind of PC pedant? That could actually be very funny. Imagine Cartman, the same jerk as ever, but this time on the other side: rigorously policing people's microaggressions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Contrarian opinion: so what? I'm glad to see Matt and Trey experimenting with the format of the show. They have to experiment to keep the show interesting, not just for the us the viewers, but also for themselves. 

Matt and Trey have been making this show for literally twenty years. They're nearly on three hundred episodes, and they've [alluded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You're_Getting_Old) to being tired of making SP on many occasions. They've said that they'll keep making SP until it gets cancelled, but that doesn't mean that they're not going to experiment with the show in unforeseen ways. In fact, if they anticipate the show to get cancelled at some point, they're more strongly incentivized to experiment with it and really take it to its limits.

There are lots of hints along these lines. Matt and Trey are definitely trying out all kinds of directions, and seeing what sticks, seeing what's interesting. One of the most significant developments from this was Randy becoming a major character, which gave the show a great breath of fresh air. 

Think about all the ways in which the new season is different from before. The thematic changes really started in Season 18/19:  

- Continuity across many episodes. Season-long arcs. In the past, episodes were lonestanding. M T are exploring longer, crazier, more convoluted plots. I don't think this is a bad thing. The season arcs are excellent for binge-watching.
- Kenny is gone. Matt and Trey have given interviews about how they're sick of Kenny. ...and now there's no more Kenny. 
- Gerald becomes a major character (similar to the evolution of Randy), but as a villain. 
- There are no more classroom scenes longer than a few seconds.
- The show is hardly about the group adventures of Kyle, Stan, Eric, and Kenny anymore. When's the last time you saw the four of them stand at their iconic bus stop?
- PC Principal changed the character of the show.
- Old background characters, whose interactions previously accounted for much of the humor, have been retired. Jimbo, Ned, Principal Victoria, Officer Barbrady, the Mayor, etc. etc. are all long-gone, and are rarely briefly seen again. 
- There's far less violence than in earlier seasons.
- Cartman has a girlfriend?!?!

Overall, I'm not concerned by current changes. South Park is Comedy Central's evergreen, and a mildly controversial change in format isn't going to change anything before they re-sign for Season 24 onwards. There have been weak seasons before; whatever. South Park's traditional format is also probably creatively unsustainable for M T, so I'm glad to see them experiment with other directions for the show. This is most likely for the best. For the record, I've also quite enjoyed Season 20 so far.  </TEXT>
