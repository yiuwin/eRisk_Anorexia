	<TEXT>  But here, I step on a limb and say that this is the right moment for people who don't currently attend plays to rediscover them, whether in New York or at home. Why? Prestige television.

For a long time, most people's day-to-day exposure to comedy and drama came largely in the form of television. (Film, too, but not for nearly as many hours.) And even the best television was made for *broadcast*, with the limitations that brings with it. It was designed to appeal to a large, moderately engaged audience that needed to be able to miss an episode or two without completely losing track of the show. That's perhaps why the best words we have to describe good and interesting television are borrowed from other forms. We describe it as "cinematic" or even "literary," because those are the words we have often used to connote art that doesn't need to be for everyone at times when television needed to be.

Where there's truth to the idea of a television "golden age" (ask me over a cup of coffee or a whiskey ginger someday), it's in the fact that cable and streaming outlets have allowed shows to flourish when they appeal to more deeply invested but smaller audiences. This is what I have called in the past [The Age Of Enthusiasm](http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2013/12/20/255723936/love-in-the-time-of-hollering-the-age-of-enthusiasm). It has also encouraged the proliferation of shows that are more idiosyncratic, personal, and experimental than television was before. Now, drama and comedy enthusiasts have daily exposure to stuff that's weird and complicated and formally experimental. They are a good, prepared audience for interesting plays in a way that I, as a teenager in the late 1980s, was not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like MetaCritic quite a bit, honestly. Easy-to-find review links, but compared to RT their surveying of critics' opinions is just so much simpler and straightforward, and I like/can understand their methodology more.

It only includes single season reviews, first of all, and simply assigns a single 0-100 score to each review. RT's model seems* to include episode scores in their show/season ratings (which I have a problem with), and has percentage scores *and* average ratings (another methodology issue: how are those avg. rtgs calculated?).

*They need a better methodology explainer

Just going to the RT homepage right now, 4 of the 6 shows listed ("MOST POPULAR TV ON RT") have 100% scores: *The Missing*, *Into the Badlands*, *American Crime*, *The Good Fight*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He didn't specify, which is why I felt the need to try to. As long as we're specifying "get rolling" as the show becoming its best self, that's fine. But I would say most people who watched the show in full were hooked far earlier than at a 30-plus episode mark, which I suppose is my point.

But the usual disclaimer: not all shows are for all people. If you're not liking it within a handful of episodes frankly, you probably shouldn't be watching it (your time is too valuable), and probably won't like it later on, either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Fargo* gave two episodes for review this season (which is still probably around 105 min. or so in total runtime). That's about the minimum you'll see. Sometimes it's two, sometimes it's the whole season, sometimes it's 7 of 8, usually it's somewhere in the middle, like 4 or 5 episodes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I watch both, and I think The Americans will age better than The Leftovers.

That's fair. I might go in the other direction, though. I think *The Leftovers* highs are higher than *The Americans*', and I think TL S1 will end up being viewed just as much if not more a quirky cult favorite (it certainly has its fans, me included) than a relative creative stumble. I think S1's fault, as much as it has one, is preference-based: it's unrelentingly dark, which puts off a lot of folks. 

As for not feeling the emotional beats on re-watch, I just gotta disagree there. Why do you say that? TV shows *are* emotion. Plot, mysteries -- they're just delivery systems for emotion, both big and small. That's why I watch shows.

They're different shows, though, both phenomenal. I just prefer *The Leftovers*, and don't imagine that changing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Metacritic rates season (pre-)reviews from critics, which are based on the allotted number of episodes networks give them for pre-review. (*The Leftovers* gave critics 7 of the 8 this season). That's when seasons are reviewed, primarily, because that's when people want them. Maybe that's changing slightly with time-shifted viewing patterns, but by-and-large people seem to want to know if a show is good around the time it premieres, and the way the TV media industrial complex (coverage, reviews, etc.) reflects as much. If you want to assign blame anywhere, assign it there and not with Metacritic.

You're often not getting reviews of entire seasons, sure, but you *are* getting reviews of multiple hours of content -- much more content than an entire movie or album, for instance -- and sometimes the majority of a season. That's enough for me. Today, if a show doesn't hook me within a few episodes I'm out. Episodes matter. My time matters. Would you watch two meh/bad movies just to get to its third, good one? edit: typo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh idk, forget the era names; that'll be sorted out later. I guess what I'm getting at: it doesn't feel totally fair to compare apples-for-apples, by virtue of being in the same era, *The Leftovers* and *The Americans* with shows like *The Sopranos* and *The Wire*, the latter of whom spawned so much of what TV is today, including those former two. You had the originals, and then you had the prolific Too Much TV era entrants riffing on them. Maybe that means they should be in the same era; maybe the Too Much TV business aspect should primarily explain a delimiter; who knows.

	<TEXT> Your bar for "get rolling" must be extremely high. If any show takes 3 seasons to get *good* it's not remotely worth your time, and *Mad Men* is good from damn near jump street. People wouldn't make it through 2-3 seasons of it -- to get to your answer -- if that were the case. Sure, it may improve over its first few seasons, as many or most good shows will, so if "get rolling" means becoming one of the all-time greats, I can see the 30-plus episode mark qualifying, but it's entertaining and a *really* good show from Season 1. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's so hard to compare shows like those three. So much of what TV is today is built on the shoulders of *The Sopranos* and *Mad Men*. *The Leftovers* only became *The Leftovers* after it took *Sopranos* and *The Wire* classes.

After watching *The Sopranos* for the first time around the new year I can safely say that, purely as entertainment, *The Leftovers* is the better show. But that's not really fair; these shows don't exist in a vacuum. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't the only "meh" Fargo opinion out there BTW. Variety's critic [hasn't been over the moon about it](http://variety.com/2017/tv/reviews/fargo-season-3-review-fx-ewan-mcgregor-carrie-coon-1202028861/). I think the author is correct in pointing out, however, that *Fargo* may be *the* current show you're not allowed to not love, which may even be the more interesting story here:

 And with shows like *Fargo*, theres even more of an illusion than normal that theres a right opinion about it, as if not loving it isnt an option. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  ...theres something ultimately academic about the way it unfolds, substituting heart for precision, artfully composed montages over bleeding hearts, distancing irony over embracing pathos. And that can get you pretty far, especially when done with the skill and visual bravado this show deploys. But it cant take you all the way.

This critique rings true for me, for instance. As great as the show can be in many respects, to me it has felt a bit too cold and removed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Here is [WGN's] full statement:

After three years of investing in marquee, brand-defining dramas, WGN America has successfully expanded its audience, its reach, and its presence in the minds of viewers. In our next phase, we intend to expand our original and unique content to continue growing our relevance and appeal to the widest possible audience. To achieve this, we will be reallocating our resources to a more diverse programming strategy and to new structures, enabling us to expand both the quantity and breadth of content aired by WGN America. This move is designed to deliver even more value to our advertising and distribution partners. To free up the resources to reach this goal, we will unfortunately not be renewing Outsiders. We are grateful to our production partners at Sony Pictures Television and the terrifically talented people who made the show possible.
