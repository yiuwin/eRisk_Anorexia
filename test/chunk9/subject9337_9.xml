	<TEXT> I seriously feel for very short people.  I hate when people argue, "oh but it all balances out because short people have smaller appetites than taller people!"  Yeah bull fucking shit.  Even if there was a difference in appetite it's basically negligible given how EASY it is to consume massive amounts of calories in small amounts of food.  If all of our appetites were perfectly aligned with our bodies then no one would ever struggle with weight!  arrrugghh </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was going to respond with "if you figure it out let me know" and then saw that the first two comments started with exactly that, lol!

I could have written your post.  My only hope is that when I gain control of some other aspects of my life I can maybe slowly begin to let go of this need to starve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only thing that really motivates me anymore is any sort of upcoming event where I have to be around people.  Or even just "I'm seeing so and so in 2 days and don't want to look like a bloated slob."  

In one of my previous bouts of "recovery" people would happily mention that I put on weight and it destroyed me.  So now I'm paranoid and think people will notice if I gain even a pound and start "congratulating" me for getting healthier.  :| </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Growing up I was aware that my mother was mildly obsessed with weight.  She went to these meetings every week where she would have to weigh in and the day before the meeting she wouldn't eat anything.  

When I was about 16 I went on my first "diet" and she gave me this really old food logging booklet.  I will have to see if I can find it, I probably still have it somewhere.  We would have ice cream after dinner and then go on a long walk to "walk off our dessert."  

Honestly looking back on it it didn't seem very extreme.  I was never really body shamed even when I was larger.  I remember once my mom told me that my (much younger) sister was crying because she wanted to be thin like me.  My sister and I were both normal weights at the time so I was pretty confused.  :/

Pretty sure my actual eating disorder was triggered by sexual abuse much later on in my life, but it's interesting revisiting the vague childhood memories and wondering if it was just waiting dormant all along. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last weekend, I binged 2 days, easily 1500 over my TDEE both days.  I weighed myself like 2 days later and saw no gain.  It DID however, get things um, moving, in the bathroom for a bit so to speak. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Believe me, I know it's not perfect.  I fucking hate "thinspo," and I think the sticky every week reporting weights is a little creepy (but I guess I can understand people wanting to do that even for maintenance or recovery).  I think the harm reduction posts, of which there are MANY, are so important.  People do crazy stupid things in their ignorance.  Also hearing the countless stories of the consequences of harmful behavior can also be helpful.  Eating disorders bring a level of isolation that almost impossible to explain to anyone on the outside.  It's great just to be able to talk and have people just understand.  If you find this place made you worse then you should just leave.  No need to assume everyone else will reach the same fate and try to bring everything down as an act of heroism, guilt, or both. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you think you are atoning for your sins or something by doing this?  What a power trip.  It's very obvious that many users use this sub to give and receive emotional support.  Also do not try to speak for all of us "actual anorexics," thanks.  Good luck on trying to control the internet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think sometimes things like this can happen to someone and then they will change for a short while.  They feel bad for a bit and try to be better but inevitably slip back into their old character flaws.  I see Marnie do this a lot throughout the series actually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live somewhere where it's sunny pretty much all year long and reaches 110 F in the summer.  I wasn't even that big, I got up to maybe a 27-28 BMI, but I still remember the way my skin would stick to itself everywhere.  Sticky sweaty skin folding, and wanting to wear full coverage outfits even in the the heat to minimize the skin to skin contact and also because I was insecure and wanted my body covered up.  This of course just caused me to overheat further.  I remember going to beach at my highest weight and being completely winded and drained after 5 minutes of walking in the sand.  That was kind of my wake up call. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can understand this as someone who used to use fast food for comfort/fun daily.  30 pounds crept up on me slowly over the course of about three years.  When I decided to lose the weight and cut down to 1200 and realized I couldn't have fast food that much without being hungry, it was hard.  Over time, going to the gym replaced binging on fast food once a day for comfort, because I started feeling great after a workout.  Those first few weeks though...I'll never forget how I CRIED about wanting frozen yogurt so badly one night but I had already hit my calorie limit for the day.  I wasn't good at budgeting my calories or planning my meal times right away.  I was very hungry and worried I would have to feel like that all the time.

It's also hard when you first start out because you don't feel/see the reward right away.  I imagine that's why a lot of people give up.  The whole simple not easy thing I suppose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah yes let's be aware of eating disorders by not so subtly telling people affected with EDs to just stop their disordered behaviors.  That always helps and never backfires. :)   </TEXT>
