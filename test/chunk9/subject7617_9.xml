	<TEXT> I'm thinking of a million options (leaning towards Princess Leia's theme right now but who knows) and it's hard to think of just how long (or short) it will have to be. I am getting married in a 1920s park ave mansion, and the aisle is NOT long, not like a big church or anything. [This is the room we're getting married in](http://www.pratthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wed-2.jpg). Obviously im not running down the aisle haha but... im really wondering realistically how much time i should be thinking of. For those with short aisles, how long did/are you planning your song to be? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not advice so much as a commiserating. Projects are dying down, i have plenty of leads but they either aren't as serious about hiring someone as they first seem, or in a recent instance, see my proposal and decide they don't have that much to allocate to a social media strategy and management... sometimes it's tough because people think that social media is "easy" and "Anyone can do it" so they dont know how to justify the cost of hiring outside.

Point is, im also in a dryspell, or stuck taking low paying work, which is really antithetical when im trying to increase my wages. I have 7 years of experience, im worth it, right?! Everyone tells me how impressive my portfolio is...no one wants to pay me for my experience.

Ugh. I feel you dude. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't believe we're 200 days away. Time flies and we only were engaged in February! We've got all of our major vendors done, photographer, dj, caterer, florist, venue, officiant, and just got rehearsal dinner booked. We have some small items, like guestbook, signs, frames for the memorial table, cake toppers that are on the way. My dress was bought but won't be here until September. Save the dates are out, invitations will be ordered as soon as Mint.com has another sale. Working on getting the ladies to order/try on sample bridesmaid dresses! A lot of the things on my checklist are smaller things...decor items, thinking about time line, and then eventually we'll be thinking about seating charts soon!

Whew! So much! What are you guys up to in planning? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How Fabulous Did You/Are You Dressing for Rehearsal Dinner? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-01 21:53:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> FMIL has been finalizing rehearsal dinner booking and it got me thinking about what i want to wear (i know, its so far out but you know, ive got the time to think about it haha). A part of me wants to wear something amazeballs, but im wondering if wearing like...full length dress or something would be too over the top. Ive also eyed like, sequined Adrianna Papell cocktail dresses as well, thinking maybe thats less in your face. But at the same time... im only a bride once and want to sort of use it as an excuse to be fabulous. What are you all wearing? For context, i live in NYC and our rehearsal dinner is at a restaurant in the theater district, so im not concerned about it not fitting the venue, but just don't want to be dressed to the nines if its going to seem weird to others. I dunno what im talking about haha, maybe im just slightly introverted. ANYWAY TL;DR what are you wearing for your rehearsal dinner and is it simple or over the top fab? Would love to see! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This might be TMI as it's fun tummy medical stuff, so if that makes you squeamish, you've been warned! I have IBS-D, was diagnosed with it almost 5 years ago, after ruling out crohns, celiacs, and a bunch of other things. It has been better now that I work freelance from home, and there's less stress. It's very much stress induced! So, im concerned about my wedding day. It's still 6.5 months away and it's all i can think about, running to the bathroom during the ceremony or something! I do take imodium when i dont feel well and id prepare to do it the night before, but even sometimes i still get sick despite taking it. Any other ladies in the same boat, or who have gotten married despite having any chronic GI illness? I need some tips or reassurance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was HELLA nervous when i joined my first gym. I was HELLA nervous again joining my newest gym! And then AGAIN when i started lifting. the nerves are super normal, but you'll never do anything if you don't just fight them! My weight section is awesome, dudes don't say a damn thing to me, or even look at me. We are all just doing our own routine, save for when someone asks another to spot them. I also see women there a couple times a week, and that makes me feel more comfy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see a lot of people here whose weddings aren't until late this year who are already ordering invitations, or discussing sending them out. But i also see conflicting info that you should send them out until 8-10 weeks prior. Im just curious, when are you all sending out invitations, or when did you? We just sent out save the dates, but i wasnt planning on sending invitations out until september. </TEXT>

I just want to be healthier in my 30s.  5'2, 116ish, putting on muscle but struggling to lose fat. Help me and be my buddy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mens Warehouse fucked up my FH shirt on a rental...twice. He got it for a wedding he was in as an usher, and the day before the sleeves of the shirt, pants and jackets were hilariously long, despite the measurements they took. The morning of, they rushed him a new suit. Jacket   pants fit...the shirt made him look like a pirate. The sleeves were huge, not just in length but in girth. I came separate from him on a shuttle, and had to bring him a regular ol white button down for him to slip into the bathroom and change into pre-ceremony, he was so embarrassed. Never again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here was my personal interpretation. So, I thought about this [BHLDN dress](http://imgur.com/8fI0nPB) for a bit. Looked great on, very dreamy. But my venue is [this place](http://www.pratthouse.com/wedding/), and it's got a very 1920s, classic New York mansion vibe. And we're having an evening wedding. I ultimately chose [this dress](http://imgur.com/T0EjJJy) (which i was drawn to even BEFORE the BHLDN dress) because it "Fit the venue" but also, because it fit the time of day and the style of dress we're asking of our guests (formal). Not to say the BHLDN dress WASN'T formal, it just felt more "Whimsical outdoor ceremony" to me. Both choices are lovely, i just feel more confident on the one i chose fitting everything overall! </TEXT>

I LOVE this subreddit. I just did a youtube rant (yeah im on youtube) about hating wedding forums and specifically about how they think honeyfunds are tacky (im firmly in the stop judging peoples wedding choices camp) and stated that this was the only place future brides should go.  </TEXT>

My best friend hired a wedding planner; just the thought of planning the wedding stressed her out, she and her now wife proscratinated a bunch, and realized they needed someone to basically get shit done for them. Me? People call me the most organized planner they know; naturally i want to plan EVERYTHING and im enjoying every moment of it! but i know thats not for everyone. I am still hiring a day of coordinator (more like, month of, as she'll be taking over things about 3-4 weeks out) so i can stop worrying when the time comes. </TEXT>
