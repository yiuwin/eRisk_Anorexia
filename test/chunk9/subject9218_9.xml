	<TEXT> I 100% understand why people think this book romanticized suicide. I had a rough time in 8th grade, and that happened to be the year that my teacher suggested this book to me. I went into it with an open and objective mind, but even now I can't help but feel a strong negative emotion in regards to it. It didn't make me feel understood. It actually made me feel less understood. Now, that was in 8th grade, years ago, so maybe my memory faded and I'm just remembering incorrectly.

But the tv series did NOTHING better. They cast a pretty girl who simply didn't fit her character at all. Every other girl in the show was deliberately less attractive, not to mention needlessly diversified.

But the drama surrounding her death is PATHETIC. The way in my opinion that suicide is most glorified by this show is the way it makes it seem that all you have to do to get back at the people who hurt you, is to kill yourself and leave irrefutable evidence lying around so that someone can pick it up and reveal it all. You might as well have just made a damn Facebook post. It completely cheapens suicide in real circumstances. What people don't realize is that someone depressed and suicidal, they're not just gonna see this show as being some 'awareness' thing. A majority of people watched it for the entertainment and learned nothing. But when there's these undertones of "Hey, you can make them hurt too. All you gotta do is ruin their lives by killing your self and blaming it on them", suicidal people SEE that. They mark it in a little notebook in the back of their head and they come back to it later, relishing the idea of getting anyone back that might have hurt them. But another thing that this show does is perpetuates the idea that there HAS to be a reason for suicide. People don't understand that sometimes people have chemical imbalances in their brain or they go through a part of their life where they have unhealthy behaviors that create a seed of self doubt and blooms into suicide. 

It's great that they're trying to say something, but this show has as many flaws as it does things correct. I fear that people will watch this knowing it's goal and then they'll think they know everything about suicide and then they'll ignore other very REAL indicators to that behavior just because it wasn't a part of Hannah's character.
