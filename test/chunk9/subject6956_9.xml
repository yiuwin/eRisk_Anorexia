	<TEXT> If I got too deep into my ED, it would be really hard to accept help from anyone. I don't really know. In my mind, I feel like I would be able to stop restricting and start maintaining my weight once I got down to a weight where I felt comfortable at. I *really* hope I don't go off the deep end and keep trying to lose weight. Hopefully I find the strength to stop once I'm satisfied...*if* I'm satisfied.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought them at Costco - Chipotle Black Bean Burgers. Personally I like the ones by Morningstar Farms better - they're only 110 calories each vs the 200 calorie Costco ones. I just wanted to finish up the Costco ones before buying the other ones ha.

If she knew I was relapsing, she'd probably distance herself from me because she feels like our relationship would end, or I would get sick and go back to treatment (which would ultimately end our relationship). Honestly it depends on where she is in her recovery. If she's totally dedicated to recovery and thriving, she would stay with me and help me get better. But if not, she would have to let go of me, which I don't blame her for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This routine is what I used to do prior to going to treatment. Now I'm living with my SO who is also recovering from an ED which makes things much more challenging. I would love to go back to this routine but it's difficult with my lifestyle. 

I would cut off liquids at 8pm just to make sure I didn't have any extra water weight for my morning weigh-ins. Logically, cutting liquids off at 8pm isn't very rational since I was taking a diuretic anyways. But it fueled my ED ha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I eat things that are low calorie without *looking* low calorie. My new go to meal is a big bowl of broccoli and a black bean burger patty with 2 egg whites on top. It's 264 calories while looking like a lot more. 

What's setting me off is that I feel like, despite the 2 meals I eat around her, I have to eat small snacks (string cheese, skinny pop) to *show* her I'm not going off the deep end. I don't know. Today might end up being a fasting day because I have class at 4pm and I might just stay at the library late, pack a meal to go and tell her I ate it at the library. I feel like such a lying piece of shit though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you restrict, what does a typical day look like for you?

When I was relapsing last year, and starting getting to newer low weights, I found that having a strict routine, compared to not knowing what I was doing day to day, helped me the most. When I felt the best, I would:

 Wake up in the morning, pee (and go #2 if it was physically possible for me to), get naked and weigh myself.

 Have my morning cup or two of coffee.

 Go ride my horse.

 Come home and have a thin sliced bagel with 2 tbsp of low fat cream cheese.

 More coffee. 

 Fuck around until 5pm or so then shower. 

 Have 4 egg whites with 2 vegetarian sausage patties. 

 Take a diuretic and Miralax mixed with some Sparkling Ice Water at 7pm. 

 Cut off all liquids by 8pm. 

 Go to bed by 10pm. 

I always found that having a good routine where I knew exactly what I was eating made me feel so much better (physically, mentally, emotionally) than leaving it up to chance and hunger cues. I found that eating when I wasn't hungry was way better than waiting until huger set in. Plus, my hunger cues were practically depleted a month prior to going to treatment. 

When I didn't have a strict routine, I would wake up thinking: "Am I going to IF today?" or "Am I just going to fast all together today?" or "Am I doing Keto today?" etc. I dropped keto completely, did intermittent fasting without really intending to, and made every Monday my fast day. Sometimes Tuesday would also become a fast day if I hadn't lost any weight according to my Tuesday morning weigh-in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I'm the same way. Rationally I know I would be miserable without my gf. I love her and I want to marry her, but my ED brain is tricking me into thinking I don't need her. I have considered that once our lease is up in September, we could live separately. Especially considering she has a ridiculous amount of stuff and isn't the tidiest person. But I'm an insecure piece of shit and I'd constantly think she's cheating on me or something if we didn't live together. 

And yeah hey how are you doing? I haven't been very active on this sub since I got out of treatment and it's hard to be on a proED sub around my gf . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been restricting again. Part of it is because I can't stand my post-recovery body and another part of it is being super triggered ever since starting school again this week. The last time I was on campus, I was starved, miserable...but at the same time beautiful and thin so my mind is racing in a billion different directions. 

My current restricting is pretty high cal (for me at least), like 600-800 calories a day. My SO is also recovering from an eating disorder but she eats normally as of now. I'm really happy she's able to eat what she wants and (seemingly) not care about her body, but I just cannot do that anymore. My SO knows I'm on a "diet" but I don't think she knows how "little" I'm actually eating. I told her I'm eating 1,200 calories a day, which is fine for my height, and she doesn't bat an eye because she doesn't know I'm often eating half of that.

She's currently unemployed so she's almost always at home and it's annoying because for some reason, I have this need to eat more than I *want* to eat because I guess I feel the need to prove to her that I'm not in the beginning stages of a relapse? I don't know how to describe it. There have been days where she would be out of the house all day until like 9 or 10pm and I could fast all day and not think about food. She was out of town for 4 days last week and I fasted for 2 of those days. It was not an issue. But now that she's always home, I feel like I have to eat to keep a sense of normalcy? 

I'm sorry if this is vague and confusing, I really don't know how to explain it.

Another part of me, probably triggered by my ED, is that I kind of don't care about our relationship at all anymore. I guess it's my ED telling me "if she weren't around you could restrict/fast all you want", so I'm convincing myself that this relationship isn't important to me anymore in hopes that one day I can have my ED back and ONLY my ED. It's so sad. I love her but I love my ED.

	<TEXT> So I had upper body day on Thursday. It's now Sunday and my triceps are still super sore. I didn't eat on Wednesday or Thursday. Friday I had 390 calories and yesterday I had 300 calories. I haven't lifted or worked out since Thursday because Friday and Saturday I rode my horse and since I'm restricting pretty low, I needed to conserve my energy for horse riding on Friday and Saturday since I have a competition today.

Before I relapsed last year I was dieting (1200-1400 calories/day) and lifting, but DOMS would go away within 36 hours. 

Any tips for shortening the period of soreness? Should I try upping my protein/calories overall? Looking back at it now, I totally should have had a protein shake after lifting on Thursday but I didn't want to break my fast. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As some of you may know, I went to residential treatment for my anorexia in June. While there, the dietitians and staff explained that anorexia/restricting/starving yourself damages your metabolism (as in makes it slower) and if you try to go back to restriction post-recovery/weight restoration, you won't lose weight/you will GAIN weight. They said that your body won't trust you and will hold on to your weight or whatever because it is scared it will be starved of calories and nutrients again. So basically, they told us about starvation mode, which I've read to be a myth prior to going to treatment.

Does this carry any validity? Is it fat logic? Or were they just trying to scare me out of restricting upon being discharged? 

Edit: Thank you all for your answers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes but with a mood stabilizer instead. I was put on Lamictal when I was 13 going on 14 for some epileptic episodes I had been having and it depleted my appetite for a good 3 months, which spiraled into anorexia. Prior to starting the Lamictal, I had been engaging in ED behaviors (I started restricting here and there, counting calories, etc) but I'd say the Lamictal is what triggered a full on eating disorder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello all. My SO is out of town for a few days so I've taken it upon myself to fast as much as I can to "detox" from the holidays (and all the weight I gained at treatment). I didn't eat yesterday and I'm not planning on eating today, however I may have 1/2 cup soy milk with a scoop of protein powder after I lift this morning. 

(I don't know if anyone here remembers but) I ride horses and I have a lesson tomorrow afternoon, so I need some carbs to get me going through my lesson or I would be putting myself and/or my horse in danger. 

Any ideas as to what type of carb would be best to break my short fast with? I was thinking a granola bar or something but that releases so quickly and has so much added sugar. I'd prefer something I don't have to cook or do too much prep with.

Thanks! </TEXT>

She's Indian and she grew up very wealthy but her parents limited what she could and could not eat due to religious beliefs. When she was a kid, it got to a point where she would eat several cream puffs all day every day because she hated what her parents forced her to eat or not eat. So I guess she never wanted to force that upon her own child. My mom has also always been a yo-yo dieter which explains a lot regarding my eating disorder.

Restricting and lifting, I got some 'newbie gains'

Before I relapsed earlier this year I was dieting (like 1200-1400 calories a day) and lifting and saw newb gains even with that so I'm excited to see what'll happen with an even lower intake. 

Get as much protein as you can within your calorie limit, and I really mean as much protein as you can.

When I restrict I usually live off protein-enriched foods (greek yoghurt, egg whites, nuts, string cheese, etc) with the exception of a 100 calorie granola bar for energy before I ride my horse so I don't die from fatigue and get myself bucked off or injure my horse in the process ha...

You have to be careful. Weights can be dangerous, obviously. Not eating enough can obviously make you dizzy, lethargic, etc. 

Even when I would eat "normally" lifting was exhausting (squatting 60lbs) but I think I'll stay away from the squat rack and use dumbbells at lower weights since I'll be so low energy. Maybe I'll be able to do more reps with lower weights.

Another thing I experienced, which I've heard some others have to, is restricting and lifting heavy results in you being absolutely RAVENOUS.

My SO and I usually go to the gym (in our apartment complex) at around 11pm because there's never anyone else there at that time. When we come home, we have some sort of protein (she has cottage cheese and usually I have a protein shake) then we go to bed. Though I'm restricting I'm going to be sure to fit in a protein shake on the days I lift. Hopefully that'll prevent me from getting too hungry before going to bed. I never wake up hungry and I do hope things stay that way when I go back to lifting.

Thank you so much for all your feedback! I really appreciate it!

Cardio is out of the question because I know I won't have the energy to do more than 10 min a day of that, and I love lifting.

Is there any benefit to restricting + lifting? Some people who are aware of my ED "past" try to talk me off the ledge by saying I'll lose muscle and get flabbier if I lift without eating enough. I honestly don't know if that's fat logic or the truth or just trying to scare me out of restricting again. Have any of you who have restricted (0-500 cal/day) seen results by lifting like 3x a week? </TEXT>

I want help but I don't.

Only a medical professional can diagnose you but two points from your post really raise the idea that you definitely have ED tendencies, at the least! Body checking excessively is definitely something "normal people" don't do. And the part about wanting help but not wanting help really hits so close to home for me. That's exactly how I felt a few weeks before I went to treatment for my ED. Like, I wanted help because, at the time, living with my eating disorder was destroying so much about my life. But at the same time, the thought of having to eat 3 meals and 3 snacks a day in treatment made me want to die. Eating disorders are always such a catch 22, a double edged sword. 

Even if you're not ready to recover, have you thought about seeing a therapist just to have someone to talk to? Unless there are extreme circumstances, I really don't think any therapist will *force* you to completely recover. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My SO (who also has an ED) has been out of the house all day, much to my dismay. She was supposed to finish her block of chores today since our apartment is a mess and I finished my chores yesterday and the day before. She's decided to spend all day with her aunt and uncle, which really pissed me off, because originally she wasn't supposed to go over there today period (she gets paid to do medical billing for them). Then, she said she was going to be there for 1-2 hours. Now she's had dinner with them and is sitting in a theatre about to watch a movie with them. 

Anyways, she says she needed to spend time with them/be away from me because her therapy session this morning was heavy and she didn't want to be in a bad mood around me since we've been fighting a lot. She decided to wait over half the day before dropping this on me. So, as you can imagine, I'm pissed for a multitude of reasons. 

But there is a silver lining to this: I get to not eat! I've staged the apartment to look like I had eaten - a frying pan is in the drying rack, an empty Ensure bottle is in the recycling bin...I've even put a clean plate and utensils in the dishwasher. I feel like a terrible person because I'm doing so much to lie to my girlfriend that I've eaten. But then part of me feels OK about it because (I feel like) she was kind of selfish with her actions today. And then another part of me that has that high from restricting/fasting back. I haven't felt this good since before I went to treatment. 

Anyways, I just felt like sharing that with someone. Shitty day turned out to be not so bad. </TEXT>

Strange enough, while I was in residential treatment for my ED this summer, I was able to have the psych there prescribe me 10mg Adderall XR. The psych was going to bump me up to 20mg XR but I discharged before they could do that and my psych at home won't even prescribe me the 10mg :( Unfortunately, I can't comment on the Adderall regarding my appetite since I took it while I was eating 3 meals and 3 snacks daily in treatment. But anyways, Vyvanse is pretty damn effective. Hopefully your psych will start you off at 5 or 10mg to see your tolerance because 20mg was way too much to start at for me, at least.

	<TEXT> I posted a little while ago how I met my current girlfriend when I was in residential treatment. She (used to) mostly restrict with a bit of bingeing and purging. Well, her bingeing wasn't necessarily eating mass quantities of food, it was like eating lots of unhealthy foods in normal quantities, but frequently. E.g. having a donut for breakfast, McDonald's for lunch, pizza for dinner. 

Anyways, I have been restricting quite a bit since Monday. My maintenance (according to the dietician at residential treatment) is around 2200 because of my high activity level. Since Monday, I've been eating sub 800 calories. Still a lot, but way less than I've been eating since like, June. 

I get so worried that I might be triggering her. Despite my restriction, she has still been eating adequately. But it makes her sad that I don't eat. She says she misses being able to cook nice breakfasts for me, going on our late night ice cream runs, etc. But honestly? Part of that disgusts me. I don't want to eat donuts or french fries or ice cream (aside from Halo Top haha) anymore. I'm sick of it all. 

Why am I such a fucking hypocrite? I would NEVER want her doing what I'm doing but I can't stop myself from fucking submitting to my eating disorder. Last night she begged me to drink some Ensure since I didn't have dinner. But I couldn't. I just couldn't. I wanted to, for her, but I couldn't get myself to drink it. I feel so bad. 

Another reason why I'm a horrible person - I cannot WAIT until she goes back to work so I can restrict in peace. I won't have to be around her all day while she eats a piece of cheesecake or a bowl of Ramen. I won't have to be so sedentary just sitting on the couch with her most of the day watching movies and shows. I can do what I want. 

Ugh. 

I also have these intrusive thoughts that I could break up with her at any moment. I could break up with her, she'd move out, then I wouldn't have anyone to recover for. I would be in the same predicament I was in in June when I was relapsing so hard, with no reason to get better. But then I'd lose the love of my life because of my fucking eating disorder. It breaks my heart that I even *think* about breaking up with her just so I can stave myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before I went to treatment I was down roughly 20 pounds before I absolutely had to buy new clothes. It was summertime so none of my shorts would stay up properly and my tops were all so baggy they almost made me look bigger than I was, and not to mention, I looked like a hobo. I didn't spend *much* on new clothes. I bought 2 new pairs of shorts, a bunch of Mossimo v-necks from Target and these adorable $10 skater dresses from H M. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think people with ED's who read it would definitely be triggered. I mean, I get triggered to lose weight, continue ED behaviors and restrict more just by browsing /r/loseit or /r/xxfitness. Almost anyone with a predisposition to eating disorders would be triggered. IMO Wintergirls is the most realistic depiction of an ED that I've ever read. Every word I read, it was like the author was describing me. For me, it wasn't a "how to guide". It was just hella triggering to read more and more about it. Kinda like how if someone is smoking a cigarette around me, I'm more likely to want one/give in to smoking one. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So as some of you may know, I went to residential treatment in June. I had to restore some weight and I've gained even more after being discharged. I'm absolutely disgusted with my body, I don't feel like I'm in *my* body (if that makes any sense), yada yada yada, I could go on. 

I don't know how much I weigh but I know I'm nowhere near my highest weight ever. But I've gained weight in SUCH strange places. Even at my highest weight I never had fat in certain places, but I do now. For example, strange thigh and back fat I never had before. 

Has this happened to any of you who've had to be weight restored? Is there any science behind this or am I just being crazy?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Follow up to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/proED/comments/54yxut/im_backkind_of_recoveryrelated_delete_if_not/) post. 

I'm not restricting heavily or anything like that. So far I've had 429 calories and will probably add another ~300 for dinner with my girlfriend. So roughly 750 (800 tops) today. Right now, it's unbelievable that I used to eat 0-500 on a daily basis. I guess my body is just *so* used to being nourished and eating 6 times a day since June. 

Part of me really hates myself and feels guilty for restricting because I spent so much time and effort and money recovering, only to be back with an eating disorder mindset. And I met the love of my life while in treatment and I would never want her doing what I'm doing right now. I would never want her to go back to her eating disorder. I have these horrible intrusive thoughts that I could break up with her at anytime if I *really* wanted to, and go back to my eating disorder. Go back to eating nothing with no consequences. 

Sigh. Right now, I do have a consequence for getting "too sick" - I could possibly lose my girlfriend. Hopefully that reminder keeps me from going off the deep end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to treatment because I was sick of being sick. I guess on and off during recovery I've missed my eating disorder, but now my ED urges are higher than ever. On and off I *do* have appreciation for my recovery body - mainly because of the affirmations from my girlfriend. She loves my body and that helps me love my body. My partner went to treatment because she was also sick of being sick. She was restricting heavily prior to treatment but has a history of bingeing and purging. 

If my girlfriend were to slide into a relapse, I would still be there for her and try to help her as much as possible. I wouldn't appreciate the lying. I would much rather her straight up tell me "I skipped breakfast and lunch" (for example) rather than lie about it. I would never scold her for engaging in behaviors. I would appreciate her honesty and try to help her. I would stay with her if she was trying to get better. If she was dedicated to NOT getting better, then I would have to end the relationship. 

These are great questions you've asked! It's given me a lot of insight. Thank you! </TEXT>

Horseback riding is going well. I actually have a competition next weekend! I'm finding riding SO much easier now that I'm eating and healthy and strong. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want to go back to my pre-recovery weight via ED behaviors and once I get to that weight, I would like to maintain. Would I love to be able to lose weight the healthy way? For sure. But I don't know if that's possible since my ED voice is SO loud right now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if anyone here remembers me, but I posted a lot from the end of March to the end of May. In the beginning of June, I went to residential treatment for my anorexia and I was away for 6 weeks.  I had to leave a few weeks early because of my insurance. While there, I got better. I gained weight, was mentally healthier and...I fell in love. I know - it sounds horrible - to meet and fall in love with someone who you were in TREATMENT with. Anyways, she moved in with me after she got out of treatment (20 days after I did) and we are living a healthy, pro-recovery lifestyle together. 

Anyways, I'm posting here because I guess I really really miss my eating disorder. I want it back. I hate my recovery body. I miss being obsessed with my weight and calories and getting tinier and more beautiful every day. 

I could easily go back to restriction at anytime. The only thing holding me back is my wonderful girlfriend. Right now, I know I'm going to marry this girl. But I know if I go back to my eating disorder, that fate *may* change. I don't want to lose her and I know relapsing will most likely guarantee I lose her. She's told me if I relapsed and went to treatment again, she would stay with me. Even if I relapsed and went to treatment again and she stayed with me, maybe I wouldn't be losing the relationship but I'd be losing precious time with her.

Part of me feels like I won't end up in treatment again even if I did relapse, because I feel like I *could* stop restricting once I got down to my pre-treatment weight, because for once in my life I have something worth staying healthy for. Someone worth staying healthy for and stopping my behaviors. 

I don't know. She hasn't gone back to work since being back from treatment and I took the semester off. In my mind, I'm going to go back to restricting once she's back at work. I don't think I want recovery anymore. 

Again, sorry if this is too recovery-ish. If it is, mods, you can delete this post. I didn't know who else to talk to about this and I remember this community being very supportive and warm. I grew SO close to so many of you in the spring.

	<TEXT> Can I just say how fed up I am with vanity sizing? I went to Target yesterday and found a few dresses on clearance that I thought were cute. I tried on a size S - too big. So then I tried on an XS thinking it would fit perfectly and I was so excited about it because it was a cute dress that was like 40% off. Guess what? It was too big. Seriously? I'm not even underweight - there is no reason an XS should be too big on me. Does Target just not expect small people to shop at their store? 

On another note, where do you guys shop? IIRC H M runs a bit small so I think I'm going to shop there this week or next. I'm happy I've lost weight but all my clothes look baggy and ridiculous on me. What stores DON'T use vanity sizing/are true to size?

	<TEXT> A mix of fasting and restricting works best for me. 

Every Monday I fast. 

On inactive days I intermittently fast - my cut off time for eating is 6:30/7pm and I won't eat again until 3pm. So that's roughly 20 hours fasting with a 4 hour eating window. This is awesome for me because I have a low calorie meal at the beginning of a the 4 hour eating period, and a small snack towards the end. That way I hardly ever go to bed hungry. 

On active days, my limit is 500. I honestly get too scared to reach 500 though. I was active yesterday and I had 370 calories.  </TEXT>

So this is some rib/collarbone/*slight* hip bone progress. I woke up at a plateau this morning despite riding and eating less than 400 calories yesterday, so I'm fasting today! I definitely look bloated in these pictures. After I rode yesterday I went to the gas station and bought a 32 oz diet coke so that's probably why I'm so bloated and why I plateaued today.

	<TEXT> Yo we're almost stats twins. I usually lose 3-4 pounds per week eating 0-500 calories per day. 1-2 times per week I coffee fast. However I will say that now my weight is getting lower, the rate of loss is much slower (more like 2.5-3 pounds per week). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I logged as much as I could - like proper meals from chain restaurants. But alcohol and aimless snacking were things I could not log. And I know what you mean about it being scary - like "what if I don't go back to restricting?" thoughts crossed my mind a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much for this 3 yeah the other day, on Thursday after I ate with barn friends, I was happy that I wasn't letting my disorder win. But now I guess it's remorse and I know it's my ED brain telling me that. On the bright side I don't have a show for a while, so this experience can at least prepare me for my next show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to be able to wear exclusively kid's sizes. I'm short, and there are already *some* larger kid's clothes I can fit into, but I want to wear almost only kid's clothes. Not only will it save me money, but I'll have that satisfaction of not being able to fit into normal stores. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just an update after my horse show weekend. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-16 21:10:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So as some of you know I had a horse show this weekend. I also went out with friends on Wednesday and ate and drank. So Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday I ate...quite a bit. Not over my TDEE, but still, way more than I'm used to. I also got my period on Saturday so as of today I'm up 4 pounds :( I'm assuming most of this is water weight and I'm taking my period into consideration as well. 

The show went really well. My horse was a good boy and we got some good ribbons. I had about 700 calories yesterday, which is 200 more than I my max. Today I'm fasting and I'll probably fast tomorrow as well. Hopefully that'll help flush some of the weight I gained since Wednesday. Basically I'm planning a 60 hour water and coffee fast. I've missed this sub! I know I've only been away for a few days but you guys are really special to me. Anyways, I'll be back here a lot since the semester has ended and I have 0 plans for the summer :P

My plan for the summer is as follows: Fast every Monday, 300 limit on inactive days and 500 limit on active days (which is 5 days a week). I'm really hoping to get down to my goal weight of 85 by the time school starts in August :3

I honestly feel really miserable and disgusted with myself. On Thursday or Friday I had posted how I didn't feel guilty after eating with some barn friends, because I know I need to fuel myself to ride. But now I feel awful. I almost regret doing the show. Gah.

Hope you all had a lovely weekend 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm the same way babe. Before I relapsed, I exercised *all* the time. Cardio, lifting and horse riding. But with restricting, all I care to do is ride my horse. Probably because I have so little energy when I restrict, whatever energy I *do* have goes towards my huge ass animal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha yeah I'm done showing on Saturday, so back to restricting on Sunday. It's just important for me to have that reminder that it's OK to be normal-ish for a few days, especially when my life literally depends on it. I'm just really happy that I don't feel guilty after today.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I ate way over my calories today and I surprisingly feel pretty okay about it. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As some of you may know from my previous posts, I have a horse show this weekend. Today all the horses went to the show grounds and we practiced and set up and stuff. All I had prior to arriving was a Fiber One bar. I wasn't planning on eating anything else besides a veggie burger when I got home, but people from my barn decided to get lunch. I could have said I wasn't hungry and skipped out, but I'm trying to make friends at my barn (I'm newish there) so I tagged along. I had a chicken wrap and a smoothie. 

Looking back at it, I could have done without the smoothie and I could have had the chicken wrap made as a bowl, omitting the tortilla. What's done is done and there's nothing I can do about it. My calories are at 1511 for today which is still under my TDEE. I'm trying to remind myself that I was *super* physically active today with all the riding I did (ended up riding 1 extra horse!) and all the walking I did around the show grounds. 

I have a feeling that the rest of the weekend will be like this - going out to eat with barn friends. And that's okay. In the past when I'd relapse, I would still eat socially, at horse shows, etc., and restrict on normal days. I think I need to get back to that point even though I'm not ready to fully recover. Last night after drinking and eating a little bit with friends, I felt super guilty. But today I didn't feel guilty. I guess because I know I need to be properly fueled to ride and compete. I'm glad I'm not letting my eating disorder win. I'm glad I'm not picking my eating disorder over my horse 3

I had planned to eat a breakfast sandwich @ 320 calories an hour before competing each day, but I think I'm going to swap that for a 140 calorie Fiber One bar since it's likely that we'll all be going out to eat every day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah!!! I'm really proud of myself for actually seeing my friends and *actually* eating something normal for once. I can't avoid social interaction forever. Being depressed is bad enough, I need to remind myself that it's OK to see my friends and eat a little bit every now and then, even if I restrict the rest of the time. I've had 16 oz of water for every 8 oz cocktail I had, plus a full bottle of water as soon as I got home so I think I'm good for tonight! I'll definitely be drinking a LOT tomorrow considering I'm riding and it's going to be like 90 degrees. I shouldn't feel *too* bad about all the calories today considering I had a riding lesson today and I will be active literally all weekend ha. I think my biggest issue is feeling bloated right now. But it'll pass. Have a good night, love. Thanks for your support as always 3 </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I went out with my two best friends tonight. I had 3 cocktails, 1.5 slices of pizza and some fries. This is all in addition to the 524 calories of safe food I already had. I'd estimate today's grand total to be 1500, which is less than my TDEE but 3x more than I'm used to eating. Really, it wasn't large quantities, but I had been restricting for 23 days straight so you can only imagine the shock my body is in right now. Holy hell. Someone please remind me that the next time I have something social planned, I increase my calories slightly for a few days beforehand so my body doesn't fucking freak out. I can still feel my hip bones but my ribs don't look nearly as bony as they usually do. I know this will go away within a day but I'm kinda sad that I won't be going to sleep tonight feeling bony. 

Anyways, there is one silver lining. I've been extremely "clogged up" for ~5 days now. If eating and drinking tonight doesn't help me, then I honestly don't know what will. I was going to allow myself to eat up to 800 calories tomorrow, Friday and Saturday because of my horse show but I think I'm going to stick to 500 a day like usual to make up for the disgusting calories I ate and drank tonight. I feel horribly guilty. Sigh. Have a good night guys 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly social food situations. Like, I'm going out for drinks with my friends tonight. If they order an appetizer for the table, it'll be really hard for me to say no. Not because I'm *dying* to eat whatever it is they ordered, but because it's part of the social experience and I don't want to look weird. This is why I've been avoiding socializing all together for the last month and a half. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People are already commenting on "how thin" I've become. Lol yeah I'm not close to being "thin". They tell me how great I look and I smile and nod and say thank you. But inside I kind of hate it because no one knows the hell I've gone through to lose weight. It's almost like, I want to be skinny but I don't want anyone else to know lol. Whenever someone complimented me, I kind of wanted to ask them for help because eating disorders are hell. Oh well. I guess people gushing over my body is better than recovery, right? My GW 100 then 85. If they think I'm thin now I'm worried what they'll say when I'm *actually* thin.  </TEXT>
