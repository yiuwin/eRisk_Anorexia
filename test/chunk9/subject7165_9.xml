	<TEXT> If want to read philosophy, I don't recommend The Prince and The Art of War as your first works. In my history of political philosophy class, I remember our professor saying that Machiavelli doesn't really fit in the development of philosophical thought. He is a new branch rather than a continuation of an older philosophical branch of discourse. You an argue that Machiavelli follows the discourse branch of Cicero, but then that would fall into the category of Statehood and Leadership and not really philosophy.

If you want a good introduction to philosophy work, I suggest reading The Republic by Plato. It talks about everything from purpose of philosophy, idea of justice, nature of reality, idea of a perfect state (along with its army and citizens), etc. My personal favorite is Hannah Arendt. Her ideas are complicated and deep, but her writing style simple and she does a great job of simplifying complex ideas. Since you mentioned, The Prince and Art of War so I'm assuming you like philosophical books that discuss warfare, violence, and statehood etc. I suggest Origins of Totalitarianism and/or On Revolution by Hannah Arendt

If you really want to read The Prince, you must read Discourses on Livy after. You can't really say that you've read the prince and know how Machiavelli thinks if you haven't read Discourses. Some scholars argue that The Prince is a satire book which does not teach us how to sieze and stay in power, but rather it is a warning for the public to be critical of those in power. He wrote the book after he was tortured by the Medeci famiy and for some reason the book is dedicated to them. I would be very pissed if someone tortured me because their rival family thought I was good at public administration so they appointed me to a good position. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In case you don't know what it is, **[Book depository](https://www.bookdepository.com/)** is an international online shop wherein you can purchase books and have them shipped to your country location. The last time I checked they also ship to the Philippines, and allegedly it should take [10-14 business days] (https://www.bookdepository.com/help/topic/HelpId/2/When-will-my-order-arrive). Shipping is still free. 

I plan to order some books but I'm worried that it will not arrive. I am not sure about the courier they use, but I am worried that they will use Philpost. We all know how terrible Philpost is, and I still have 8 letters and packages that haven't arrived after half a year(2 weeks my ass). 

I want to know if anyone has tried it out (or interested in trying it out) and please tell me your experiences and thoughts about it.

Thanks! :)  </TEXT>
