	<TEXT> "I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me, and they ask me. They say, 'What's your MMR'? And I tell them, look, we know what my MMR is. We've had almost seven years of the worst kind of patches you can imagine. Oh, my God, I can't believe it. Gankings and farmings of the pos1s the pos2s and the pos3s. It's terrible. It's just terrible. Look, if you want to know what my MMR is, do you want to know what my MMR is? I'll tell you. First of all ranked matchmaking, by the way, I love ranked. It's probably my favorite lobby, no it is my favorite lobby. You know what, it's probably more like the number three but with a couple of twos behind it. A couple. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of twos. Except for 2GD, now he's a two that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy, but he's like 'F I R E D', on and on, like that. He's like an ass! You know what I mean? He's like an ass. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these asses, and we can fire them and lobby to bring them back and fire them. SHANGHAI them even. Did you know that? We can shanghai them OR productionvalue them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at lobbying than me. You wouldn't believe it. So, we're gonna have the best MMR, believe me."  </TEXT>

Colour and favourite become color and favorite.

Aesthetic and oestrogen become esthetic and estrogen.

Programme becomes program, doughnut becomes donut.

There's nothing wrong with being simplified, really, American English does make more sense.

	<TEXT> r/dota2 and its related subreddits are infested with childishly condescending pricks as it is now (without MMR transparency). With MMR transparency, every serious discussion will turn into "hey you, I have a higher MMR so listen closely as to why you're wrong".

For the record, having a high MMR in dota doesn't necessarily mean the person has something sensible to say. It is entirely possible that an immature (biologically speaking) trashtalking 10yo is 5-6k MMR while a respectable adult who already has all their shit together in life is barely 2k MMR. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I'm not saying that North Korea are definitely failing as much as the media tells us, I doubt that they would hide how powerful their weapons are. Countries have nuclear weapons as a form of threat and/or deterrence; it's basically saying "leave me alone and you'll be fine". As much as North Korea is better off without it's current government, I doubt they're comical evil masterminds who dream to develop superweapons for global domination. They just want the US out of their affairs. </TEXT>

They're not brain dead, they deliberately say that to stir shit among the enemy team. Either that or it's just salty taunting along the lines of "I'm leading so much that you'd use an RP just to get me." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good dota player shouldn't need these "statistics" to know how well they did in the game. Having your suggestion would only potentially cause players who played badly in a game to tell themselves "woo I have the most/highestwhateverin this match! Looks like I was doing well after all".

	<TEXT> Pretty mundane but a friend and I once had to lift a trolley full of very heavy equipment which was a challenge even for two persons. Another friend walked by and casually said, "actually, there isn't a need for two persons to carry this..." I didn't even finish listening to what he had to say because I was already giggling in my heart knowing that it's bullshit. The both of us promptly stood aside and asked him to demonstrate. He then attempted to lift the trolley but it didn't move an inch off the ground while he let out a weak "ugh.. ugh.." and at that instant we burst out laughing. The funny thing isn't him failing but the fact that he thought he could do it and then ended up exactly as we imagined. It also helped that he looks and behaves pretty feminine.  </TEXT>
