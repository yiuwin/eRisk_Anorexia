	<TEXT> Yeah, the selection of the president is undemocratic. Because in 1 out of 20 elections, the person who did not get the most votes won.  
This was due to an undemocratic system that favors geographical locations over people. That system was in place to placate the states that had slaves, but wanted their political clout to include large numbers of people who were not recognized as people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quite well.  
People would be free to vote third party if they felt like it, meaning new third parties that are better suited for the times can rise and displace the old ones.    
Rather than the current system where if you attempt to go third party, you just ensure the person you like least gets voted into office. </TEXT>

Now it's rock/paper/scissors until one side wins 10 in a row.

	<TEXT> Mainly because  humans don't eat like most other animals.  
The stuff animals eat usually has water in it.  
It could be blood from flesh or juices contained in leafs or fruit.  
Humans eat alot of dried, preserved, salted and/or cooked food, that doesn't have that much water in it.  
  
Secondary to this is the fact humans sweat more than other animals. We're adapted for running down prey by having an more effective means of eliminating heat through sweat, it also means we lose more water that way. </TEXT>

If the chemical gets stuck, the scientist know that that kind of DNA is there.  
Scientist can see what gets stuck and where.
These methods are called Genetic Markers.

Everyone has different DNA, most of it is the same, but scientist know which kinds usually vary from person to person and which kinds of chemicals stick to those kinds of DNA.  
   
So they'll run the process, see what pattern is formed by the stuck chemicals.  
If they see half of a person's pattern in your pattern, then most likely that person is either your parent or child.  
If they have the patterns for both parents they can compare them with the child and see very clearly if they are the real parents or not. </TEXT>

That being said, this is not the right way to do this.  
For the correct way, consider Carl Sagan's Cosmos. There was an episode where he talked climate change, at that point science wasn't sure if it was going to be global warming or global cooling, so he talked about both.  
Fast forward a few decades, the global cooling thing was not censored out, rather at the end a now much older Sagan recorded a segment a basically saying "Yeah, it's confirmed it was Global Warming, now we know!"  
Nye should have done something similar, "Here are the basic for non-binary sexes and some of the choice, gender != sex ,etc ,etc, now we know!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fallout is a game series spanning decades, it used to be 2d isometric but went full 3d with another company for Fallout 3.  
Avatar is an American animated series that made extensive use of Anime techniques.  
Both are great series and highly recommended.  
Though the Fallout series is long running enough to have more or less completely changed hands Fallout 3 and 4 being significantly different than 1 and 2 in setting and some cases tone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fallout is set in a post apocalyptic future. The style of the game was delibrately designed to mimic a 1950's science fiction serial. Combining the slightly goofy feel with some bleak modern sensibilities.  
It takes place after a nuclear war between China and America wiped almost everything out. Some of the population survived by taking shelter in underground bomb shelter communities called Vaults. In most cases you play as a former resident.  
  
Avatar: the Last Airbender is set in another world based mainly on various Asian cultures. In this setting some people have the power to control one of the 4 elements: Water, Earth, Fire, Air. However one person called The Avatar is able to control ALL of them. When he dies, he is reincarnated in another person and can communicate with all his past lives.  
Avatar: The Last Airbender setting was a mainly medieval Asian setting with some steam punk elements.  
Avatar: The Legend of Korra followed the next incarnation of the Avatar and started with a 1920's shanghai feel, but by the third season had a full on late 1930's WW2 feel, complete with a Magical Female Hitler.   
  
This crossover idea continues the Avatar setting to the future, and then nukes it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fallout and Avatar: the Last Airbender.  
Avatar has already gone Diesel Punk with Legend of Korra.  
Keep the retro-future aesthetic from Fallout, add in martial arts and an Asian inspired spiritual aspect.  
Maybe have one of the previous Avatars go crazy and start the whole war, the rest of the Avatar spirits are trying to suppress that one, adding an internal struggle to the current incarnation as he explores the wasteland.

	<TEXT> George RR Martin is one of the few people who can use prophecy correctly.  
One character receives a prophecy:  
three treasons will you know... once for blood and once for gold and once for love..  
  
And then spends the rest of the series thinking... "is that guy going to betray me for blood, gold or love? That other guy who has already betrayed me, was it the blood, gold or love? Was it even a treason?"   
Cue the paranoia.   </TEXT>
