I don't have any articles cued up right now but I have heard of several cases of people developing DM1 as adults after a bad flu or something and I have a good friend who developed DM1 in her early 20s after a bad case of mono.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Type 1 diabetics often lose weight before being diagnosed because they aren't producing any meaningful amount of insulin so they are not storing or using any of the carbohydrates that they are taking in.

Type 2 diabetics can make insulin but they don't respond to it as well so their blood sugars are elevated but they are still using some of the carbohydrates that they are taking in, so they probably won't drop weight.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree about the one sided conversations thing. I also have anorexia and anxiety with a history of depression and it really bothers me that I know so little about the people who I see so regularly (therapist, dietician, doctor) or the people who took care of me for months a a time when I was in the hospital or residential. 

I completely get that providers need to set boundaries butI try to make a point to chit chat with my patients whenever I have time and they seem interested because I always wished that someone would tell me about their hobby or pets when I tried to steer the conversation away from me and my 'ish'.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so both of them work to reduce pain and fever but ibuprofen (Advil) is an NSAID (non steroidal anti inflammatory) so it will also reduce swelling which makes it more effective for things like sprains and muscle strains where a lot of the pain is caused by inflammation. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) doesn't do jack for inflammation

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil) both work by blocking COX enzymes in the brain which inhibits the production of some prostaglandins. Prostaglandins do a lot of good, helpful things but some cause pain and inflammation after cellular injury by a whole bunch of mechanisms sat the site of injury and in the peripheral nervous system (and a bit in the central nervous system) and they act on the hypothalamus (body thermostat) to raise body temperature which is what causes someone to spike a fever.  

Ibuprofen is a nonselective COX inhibitor which means it blocks the production of prostaglandins that act in the peripheral and central nervous systems to cause pain, fever and inflammation (yay!) BUT it also blocks the production of prostaglandins that protect the stomach lining which is why taking a lot of ibuprofen can lead to ulcers and even normal doses can cause stomach upset in some people. 

Tylenol doesn't do much for the prostaglandins that act in the peripheral nervous system so it doesn't really do anything to reduce inflammation (which is what causes a lot of pain at the site of injuries) but it works in the central nervous system and effectively reduces fever and the sensation of pain that isn't caused by swelling. Also it can majorly fuck up your liver if you take too much so beware. 

I probably got something wrong (please correct me) but yeah.

	<TEXT> Thank you!

Honestly, I like to think that I am reasonably self aware of my limits and I fully acknowledge that there is an insane amount of information that I do not know and many skills/pearls that will only come with time and clinical experience. I do enjoy reading and researching topics that may be beyond my scope but that is because I'm a nerd and I have no delusions that as a 19 year old sophomore in college I have any use for this information beyond personal enrichment and sometimes getting a deeper understanding of things I am learning in lectures. 

I asked this question more out of curiosity because I find it interesting to hear what people do and don't enjoy doing in their day to day practice.  </TEXT>

I'm biracial and almost none of my black cousins know how to swim even though they are upper middle class and have the time, money and facilities to learn. They mostly cite not wanting to damage their hair as the reason but it still strikes me as odd that these people who take Caribbean vacations and live in country club neighborhoods with pools never felt the need to spring for a few swimming lessons.

	<TEXT> Really struggling with my eating disorder and it is starting to scare me that I can't seem to break myself out of this cycle. 

I feel so out of control with my symptom use and I don't know what to do; my team thinks that I need inpatient (which isn't an option) but I'm stuck in this cycle of restricting, purging and occasionally bingeing which I've never dealt with before now. In the end it all comes down to my fear of gaining weight; I don't think that I need to and ultimately I know that this fear is what is driving my behavior. My team thinks that I need to gain and even if that is true I just don't feel like I'm in a place to make that happen and in the grand scheme of things I don't think it should be at the top of my treatment priorities. I know that my symptom use is a major problem but I'm really struggling to feel a sense of urgency because I feel like my body is still able to cope which i know is so incredibly stupid.

I had therapy and a dietician appointment yesterday and they were both like we don't know what to do with you and I'm trying to get in my full meal plan today but its not even morning snack time yet and I just feel fat and overwhelmed and I can't see why I need to do this. 

I'm just so frustrated and done with myself; I hate the way that I'm living but I don't want to gain weight and I feel like I'm "too fat" to justify as eating the amount that they want me to. </TEXT>

I'm really lucky that I got almost a full academic scholarship to school that includes housing so my parents are willing/able to cover most of my books and fees that aren't covered by the scholarship, but I decided not to work during the school year so right now I'm living off of what I saved by working full time all summer and spending almost nothing. 

It is completely doable since I only have to worry about day to day expenses (copays on therapist/doctor/dietician visits and meds, groceries, gas for my car) and all of the big expenses like insurance and tuition are covered I just have to be thrifty and make sure I keep track of where my money is going because when you have $40 a week (on average) little expenditures can add up.  </TEXT>

I'm sure that plenty of people could stand to lose 10 or 15 pounds but the overwhelming majority of my classmates, instructors and nurses I see on my rotations appear to be in the healthy weight range and there is a pretty large number of us who are into fitness (marathons, lifting etc.) and healthy eating 

Nurse administrators are another story though.  </TEXT>

I'm not going to pretend that I'm poor or have any idea what it is really like to struggle financially but as a college student who doesn't work during the school year I have to keep myself to a pretty tight budget during the school year and I eat pretty well on the cheap. I do have a car and access to a pretty decent sized refrigerator and freezer but I save a lot of money by sticking to my cheap essentials and only buying things when they are on sale (I stock up when I can get a good price). 

Sure, its  a bit repetitive but I don't mind eating the same thing for most meals if it allows me to have money to spend on other nonessential things (and gas. I am very grateful that my parents got me a car as my graduation gift/reward for getting a full academic scholarship but good grief I can't afford to only get 20mpg) </TEXT>

I also don't like that they seem to want the entire world to change to accommodate the neurosis of people with eating disorders. Yes, people should be considerate but as someone with an eating disorder, I see it as my problem not something that everyone else needs to be protecting me from. People with eating disorders are a pretty small portion of the population so while things like nutrition labels on menus may challenge some of us they either help or do nothing for the vast majority of the population so we should be the ones learning to cope.
