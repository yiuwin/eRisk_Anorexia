	<TEXT> True, I agree with you completely on the points you made on the ARG. 

Don't want to sound like I'm defending Blizz either, because I don't fully agree with how this ARG has developed. I'm more shocked at the people who act like Blizzard haven't thought this out or haven't thought about how they wanted the ARG to develop. Yeah, it hasn't worked out well for the fans or the game's publicity but I think they planned it to be the way it has been, and are continuing down this path regardless of what the press or fans say. I don't know if I'm expressing what I want to say in the right way, but I hope you get what I mean lol.  </TEXT>

Not to say they want it to feel shitty, but I think they know they're only giving us tidbits and doing it on purpose, and to some degree stringing it out so they can announce her at Blizzcon. Pretty standard marketing and keeps people talking about the game.  </TEXT>

A (shitty) ARG that gradually gives us nothing but false hype in the lead up to BlizzCon announcement.

Affair:Dorado burst Bank We received a photo of the security department bank Dorado, where the two criminals who broke during the protests appear. Look at these two funny Can you believe it? I remember seeing them at the time of the crime. Apparently they have been working with hackers or dead, there must be some clue that we can continue. Angel M. Burciaga Physical Security Specialist

**EDIT: Better translation from a native speaker below!**



We've received a photo from the Security Department of the Dorado Bank, where the two criminals that broke in during the protests appear. Look at these fools, can you believe that? I remember seeing them at the time of the crime. It seems that they've been working with the hackers or Los Muertos, there was to be some clue we can track.


**UPDATE:** /u/inuit88 has pointed out that the 11:04 plastered all over the photo might be a reference to the opening ceremony date for Blizzcon, when some people believe Sombra will be revealed/released.


**UPDATE #2:** The same photo has been found at Dorado http://i.imgur.com/2xdc0xi.jpg

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I understand this would probably take ages to implement, and would be a considerable amount of work, but I think it would be so cool to have alternate versions of existing maps in place to provide some variety. Wouldn't work with all maps but with some it would be cool.

Imagine:

* Nepal during a snowstorm
 
* Night time Eichenwalde, with oil lanterns and open fires

* Hanamura at dusk

* A Monsoon in Numabni

* Voskaya at sunrise


Any other ideas? Personally would love to see this, although I know the changes are pretty slim.  </TEXT>
