	<TEXT> I think i am over him now, it's just that my current experience with a guy the erm..just not as great. Though my ex and i were classmate for more than a year, sitting next to each other, so maybe comparing him to the new guy isn't that fair.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe not movie related but the **Legion** series handles superpowers in such creative ways. They're all very subtle, never clearly mentioned on screen, and the audiences themselves can work it out by the hints given throughout the episodes. I wish superheroes movie would take more risk and demonstrate a little bit creativity with their heroes's power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it's so freaking common in our community that most of us no longer want to hear about it. But imo, high frequency of these "incidents" does not mean people aren't deeply affected by them. So for today, share your story, how old was you when it happened, how long did it last, are you guys still friends now ? </TEXT>
