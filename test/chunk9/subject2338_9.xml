	<TEXT> Allowing Anorexia to take 6 years of my life,and since I'm not ready for recovery,I'll likely give up more years of my life to this fucking disorder.

I hate that I allowed myself to get this skinny,I hate that I can't get better,I hate that I've given up SO much just to be skinny,and I hate that I'm not ready or willing to begin recovery yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been in an inpatient program,intensive outpatient program,and a few other programs as well. 


Inpatient is the most extreme,usually "last resort",that can last anywhere from a few weeks to months. Mine lasted a few weeks,which unfortunately wasn't long enough.


One of the outpatient programs I did was seeing a psychologist 3 times a week,and a medical doctor to monitor my weight 2 times a week,and then a nutritionist every other week.


Another outpatient program I did was with a medical doctor who used to work at a major eating disorder facility in Arizona,where I would visit him twice a week,and each session he would ask me questions,pose challenges for me,and give me "homework" to work on.


Inpatient for me was $50,000 for a 3 week program,albeit a damn fancy program,but that is an INSANE amount of money,and insurance companies are not quick to jump for anorexic patients. As soon as you make any progress,they stop covering you,and oftentimes girls are forced to leave programs too soon,and relapse immediately.


My advice from a seasoned anorexic: GET HELP NOW. No matter what. I have given up so much,over 6 years of my life to this fucking monster of a disorder,and I'm at the point where I feel like I can never recover. Please,please,please reach out for help. It breaks my heart to see girls going through this hell,and I don't want anyone else to lose 6 years of their lives like I have.

Please get help. I can't stress that enough. If there is anything that I can do to help,please let me know. I have a lot of experience with eating disorders,inpatient programs,and I want to help you in any way that I can.
Good luck honey!!

EDIT:I reread your posting,and you mentioned money was a concern. If you can find a medical doctor in your insurance circle(or whatever they call it), who has experience with eating disorders,that may be enough. At one point I was seeing a medical doctor who had very little experience with eating disorders,but she took me on anyways,and she was very helpful. They are options! I have also heard of online communities with medical doctors and psychologists who can walk you through recovery as well,but those tend to be more helpful for bulimic patients rather than anorexic patients,but that's an idea as well!

	<TEXT> Sex with a HUGE guy is not fun. 
It hurts,and feels like your cervix is being stabbed. OUCHHHH.
I prefer an average guy any day.
I've been with a kinda small guy,which did make things less enjoyable for me,but definitely didn't ruin my night. You just make things work! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My 20(M)Ex and I(F,19) are hooking up and acting like a couple again. Can this end well? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Alright,so my ex and I were together for two years. We dated through the end of our Jr. year of high school,and eventually moved to college together.

We broke up this past January after her snooped into an old Reddit account of mine,and found things that I had written that made him mad. I never cheated or anything like that,but for whatever reason,he got mad and we broke up. As a couple we didn't fight much,didn't argue or yell,but our breakup was very,very messy,and didn't end well at all.

We didn't talk after the break up,for 2 months,and then we met up during Spring Break and talked. We ended up hooking up several times that week,and since then,we've hooked up a few times again. We talk like we used to talk. We giggle together,he calls me with questions or concerns,and we chat on a weekly basis on the phone,for a least an hour or so. We're basically acting like a couple again. Can this end well,or are we being stupid?

We both know that this isn't the smartest decision,at least by most peoples' standards,but when we're hanging out again,it just feels so normal and natural. So,are my Ex and I setting ourselves up for a mess again,or is this just normal couple behavior? Thanks!

TLDR: My ex and I are hooking up,and acting like a couple again,without labeling anything,or calling ourselves exclusive. Is this a mess waiting to happen? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're both from Montana,so she definitely didn't know any one who graduated or even attended FIDM. 

I remember one thing she specifically didn't like about FIDM was how non of credits would transfer either. If I'm correct(and I may be wrong) the degrees are incredibly specific,and wouldn't be recognized at other schools,if she wanted to transfer. She did look into the scholarships,but bottom line it's a for profit school. They care more about making money,sometimes more than education. I'm currently at college in Montana,and getting ahold of my sister during her finals is tough,but I'm waiting to hear back from her to get more info for you. I would honestly suggest a more broad business program for your sister,than what FIDM offers. </TEXT>
