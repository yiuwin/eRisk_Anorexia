	<TEXT> I hope you realize that its not simply because he's Korean that I don't care. It just bothers me that because of a gimmick he gets so much "interest" and the OP going out of his/hers way trying to convince us he's a legitimate artist. 

I don't know it just bothers me, even if he is a good musician (which I doubt). </TEXT>

Well I still think I am right, and it just goes to show how dumb most of MMA fans are if they are getting excited about every little tweet and tidbit for years. I still think that until the end of the weigh ins a fight is irrelevant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read LOTR before Narnia, and with that it made it impossible for me to enjoy Narnia, it just seemed so lazy and childish. Later on in my early teens I watched a documentary about the life of C.S. Lewis, it didn't help, like at all. He was somehow annoying as an atheist and as a Christian, though I liked he's interactions with Tolkien. 

What also didn't help is that most of people in my childhood that liked Narnia books/movies were into any cheesy fantasy as long as its fantasy. You know crap like Eragon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dragon Age:Inqusition "Game of The Year" 

Seriously, if there is a proof of how irrelevant and bad game press is its DA:I! Its basically an MMO, or at least all the shitty parts of an MMO and single-player. All you do is fetch quests in generic fantasy land, I mean seriously, the aesthetic design of this game is so unimaginative, so dull, so "been there, done that", I just wonder did the designers of this game have any pride? This game would have looked dull to me if it were released before Origins. 

Most of the characters are basically Bioware cliches, annoying or forgetable. The main villain is "HUR DUR I AM GONNA RULE THE WORLD!!!", and there are some seriously cringe inducing moments. 

SPOILERS:
I quite the game after a mission in which you travel to the Fade a dream world ruled by various entities. You get into the part of the Nightmare demon, which has the most pathetic taunts, like a 5 year old, apparently to scare your party members. Then there is Justinia, to this date, the most annoying voice actor I have ever had the misfortune of hearing. 

Dragon Age is definitely dead to me now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have traveled a lot between two European countries, one of them in Scandinavia and one of them in Balkans. 

So obviously I have never meet somebody whom you could call even remotely a "fanatic Trump supporter" though I meet and know A LOT of people that favored Trump, much more than Hillary.

Strangely, in Scandinavia I have never had a direct contact with rabid SJWs but they were there.

Anyway, I used to work at a night club in Scandinavia with a very diverse staff, and let me tell you something, all of us, fucking all of us hated Muslim customers. They were rude, misogynistic, racist, violent, criminal... About 90% of problems we had it was because of them. When we raised the entrance price they stopped coming, and I cannot even describe how much of a relief that was among the stuff. Police didn't come every night, we didn't need the security guys all the time, we just had much less stress all around.

At first I didn't want to use the term "Muslim" but then I realized, yes all of these people shared one thing in common: Islam. They were Turks, Kurds, Syrians, Albanians, Arabs, Persians and all of them shared very similar traits, which confused me. Even our own Muslim staff hated them. Of course not all Muslim customers were assholes, but unfortunately too many of them were. 

The scariest thing about all that was that they were 2nd or even 3d generation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am kind off into MMA and a lot of top tier coaches have the attitude that they would prefer that you know nothing when you want to be trained by them instead of having a bad or mediocre teacher. Because then they have to waste time deconstruct you a base level and start over. 

I think its the same with History, I wouldn't even recommend Extra History as a starter pack, because their cherry pick what they want and they constantly attempt to create a "narrative" or a story out of history. Besides, most of the stories they tell are basic school book stuff, so if you can't be bothered with reading an entry of a wikipedia article, maybe you shouldn't pretend you are interested in history.

I do like thing they do, and that's humor, the first episode of the first crusade series was hilarious,  but even that seems like they toned down so they can have these serious dramatic stories.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me make clear that I have no issue with this Mario game specifically, because its obviously for children. And actually a lot of games have difficulty modes which also I have usually no problem with. Though most of the time, the dificulty the game was meant for is around normal-hard, I have even played some games which the developers designed around Master difficulty but were forced to create other modes because the publisher pressured them. The developers didn't like that, because they didn't want the players to have a wrong or diluted experience of the game and to play the game unbalanced.

But DS specifically makes the point that there is no Easy mode but there is no Hard mode too, you should be playing the game the way it was designed, and it isn't about "git gud". Dark Souls gameplay is essential to experiencing that world and its atmosphere, you are supposed to feel weak and helpless, you are supposed to question, think etc...  But then you are supposed to grow confident, wise, cunning and even cynical, as you grow as a player and as your character grows more powerful. The developer do not want you to miss out on a great game with an easy mode. And in all honesty, DS games aren't that hard, but not only that they DO HAVE AN EASY MODE, its called summoning! You can summon people to help you out, that drastically changes the difficulty. 

Once again, you can just use cheat engine or some trainers to finish the game with ease, you will see how shitty that feels. </TEXT>

Not every game has to be for everybody, why is that such a radical notion? Why would you insult your own dignity and play DS on easy mode? What will you get out of that, a true DS experience you certainly won't.

If its so important for you to win a game, just download a fucking trainer or whatever they are called, press one button to win and be done with it.  </TEXT>

As for the other group, the people that left because of the movie.

	<TEXT> Since the time I was in high school and some of the people I knew started going out in a gym, I was confused by this. 

Very quickly I started thinking of steroids as the bad stuff that is a magical chemical that gives you muscles and is for cheaters. Naturally when people mentioned taking "protein powder" and creatine I thought they were also some "bad" substances. Then it was made clear to me that they aren't and when I asked why were "steroids" bad, I didn't understood the answer. 

Later on I got the impression that even on steroids you have to eat conventional food more and practice more, but that you have a lot of potential health hazards, but it was too vague. I also noticed that some people can afford much better food then other, so wasn't that unfair advantage too? 

Fast forward to now, I still have trouble understanding why is something illegal in sports and why is something not. Like I just don't get it. Why is caffeine fine or a certain amount of testosterone. Some people say certain substances or certain amounts of some substances are a health hazard, well in a lot of sports there are all kinds of injury and completely clean athletes have health issues after retiring because their bodies have trouble adapting to a new life style (Heart and lungs usually). So sports are a fucking health hazard anyway. My other point would be, is somebody forcing them? I think not, and if they are stupid enough to use to them for short term gain, then let them and the consequences of that will be a good example for future generations. 

Most convincing argument at least for fighting I got was from coach Zahabi, its basically that some of these PEDs make you stronger and faster at such a rate that the development of your technique suffers incrementally, as why would you bother with developing technique if you can just force your way through. But I think that would be irrelevant if everyone would be on the juice. 

Obviously some substances (or practices, like that thing where you freeze your blood) help you do sport, but why are some banned and some not? I also suspect not all banned ones are bad for your health if you use them in moderation. I mean obviously athletes are gonna use everything they do be better, so what makes this arbitrary line drawn? Why should I care what gave Belfort the ability to spin heel kick, I was fucking entertained.  </TEXT>

The most annoying myth about pirates is that accent, I mean what would even start such a stupid myth is beyond me, who got the bright idea that a group of people of various backgrounds have the same exact accent just because of their profession? 


I also cannot help but remember, this one stupid anime show called "One Piece", where the main character wants to be the "Greatest Pirate of All Time" in typical anime fashion. However I do not recall that he or he's crew ever, like ever do any pirating. They just fight gimmick bad guys.  </TEXT>
