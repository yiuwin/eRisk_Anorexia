	<TEXT> That's really just selection bias. MMOs fail over time; you just don't remember all the ones that failed a very long time ago. Moreover, very old MMOs often have lower hardware requirements, which lowers the cost of continuing to support them.

WoW is really only still around because of its ridiculous user base. There's strong social effects in MMOs; once the MMO falls below a certain level, it is very hard to maintain population without an unsustainable content release schedule. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The law applies equally to everyone. If you think it should be okay to kill other people for their political views, then you must think it is okay to kill you for your political views. If you disagree, then really all you're saying is "the rules don't apply to me", which means you aren't signing the common social contract necessary for participation within a civilized society - which means said civilized society is justified in killing you in order to protect itself and those within.

Civilization is a choice, and the rules of civilization must apply equally to all, otherwise there's little incentive to participate in it and a great deal of incentive not to do so.

Civilizations have a monopoly on violence - you have no right to use violence against people outside of the boundaries of the law, which establish that personal violence can only be used in self-defense. You can't just use violence against someone because you don't like their political views, however noxious they might be, because that would make it okay for people to attack other people for their political views.

I mean, let's face reality here - if your point of view is that you want to exterminate these people, aren't they *correct* in wanting to exterminate *you*? </TEXT>

This isn't an anti-immigration thing.

The people arrested were people associated with American gangs involved in smuggling people, weapons, drugs, and other things across the border.

That a number of them were illegal immigrants is hardly surprising (after all, it isn't like people who are dragging sex slaves into the US for Mexican drug cartels exactly care about immigration law), but the idea that it is somehow outrageous that most of the people arrested were citizens is nonsensical. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone who is ranting about how ICE is horrible - you didn't read the article. This headline is a huge attempt to mislead you.

ICE stands for *Immigrations and* **Customs** *Enforcement*.

The operation in question was *not* primarily directed at illegal immigrants, it is part of an anti-organized crime/anti-gang initiative:

 Project New Dawn, a part of ICEs Operation Community Shield program that targeted street gangs between March 26 and May 6, led to the arrests of 1,378 people nationwide who authorities say are involved in transnational criminal activity, including drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, human smuggling and sex trafficking, murder and racketeering.

It isn't really surprising that most of the people involved weren't illegal immigrants; they were targeting gangs within the United States. While obviously this did include some illegal immigrants (unsurprisingly, people connected to Mexican drug cartels don't really care much about immigration laws - if you're dragging in sex slaves from Mexico to the US, you probably aren't someone with a lot of respect for border controls), it wasn't really directed primarily at illegal immigrants.

This was done by the National Gang Unit, which is a part of ICE. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Comparing to 1970 is incredibly misleading - Allende was a total economic disaster for the country, which is what caused the Junta to emerge in the first place. It would have never been successful if Allende wasn't such a clusterfuck. Allende was in charge of the country until late 1973, and Pinochet didn't fully assume control of the country until a year later.

Under Allende, there was runaway inflation - about 140%/year. The GDP fell sharply due to his various measures, including protectionism (which crippled foreign trade and investment), as well as his dispute with the US government.

Things were already a disaster by the time the Chicago Boys went to work, and successive governments have continued the reforms through to the present day. They have clearly paid off - Chile is one of the richest countries in South America.

The World Bank has said that about 60% of the improvement with the economic situation of poor Chileans is due to the implementation of these economic policies, with the other 40% being due to poverty-alleviation things put into place in the 1990s.

The economic policies of Chile opened it up to trade, which paid off a great deal in the long term, because it increased both trade and external capital investment into the country.

Capitalism also lead to the re-introduction of democracy. The privitization of a lot of industry in the country after the Banking Crisis of 1982 lead to a big economic boom and decentralized the power of the government. Without the government being in control of a lot of things, as it had been under Allende and the early part of the Junta, freedom could flourish a lot more and the government had a lot less power to crack down on and repress the people. The end result was the return of democracy to the country as the central government lost power.

The reforms came in three major phases - the second phase began in the mid 1980s, after the crisis of 1982, when the government finally divested itself of a lot of its holdings (in 1982, it actually held as much or more of the country's industry than it did under Allende, to similar ill effect).

1982 is [cherry-picking;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_Chile#/media/File:Economic_growth_of_Chile.PNG) it was a very bad year for Chile. But you can see that the years under Allende were bad, while after 1975, 1982 was the one bad year.

Pinochet was in charge of Chile until 1990.

Incidentally, inequality is meaningless. Making everyone poor is much worse than having some people be poor and some people be rich. In the former, everyone is badly off; in the latter, only some people are badly off. The cause of the inequality is that a lot of people have gotten a lot richer, not that the poor have gotten poorer. Capitalism was good for the people, and indeed, as the World Bank noted, over half of the improvement in the lot of poor people in the country was the result of the economic reforms. </TEXT>

I've seen it. It is actually really hard for the other team to defend against, both because they lose a lot of their front-line protection and because it means you have to stop their payload AND their minion line AND them from taking boss...

	<TEXT> I don't think it is normally all that snow-bally in the usual sense of the word but if you end up down by two it seems really hard to come back. I think I've won every game where my team was up by 2 payloads at any point during the game.

While you might say that this is true of any map, the constant payload spawning on Hanamura means that there's a sort of rate of speed at which you can accumulate "points", so if your team has two payloads out and the other has none and has two points instead, they gain a payload while you don't, which puts them even further ahead (at least potentially) and it is really hard to do three things at once as a team.

 In the meantime, I have heard two legitimate concerns: Payloads take too long to start moving back, and do so too slowly, making it hard to not lose once you have 1 core health left and the enemy has two payloads out. I'd like to see a change here where if the enemy team has 1 core health left you can't have another payload spawn.

I disagree. This helps push the game to its natural conclusion - it ends games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is a rather poor review of the map. I also feel like it misses a few critical points.

For one thing, I find that the boss is generally best seized at the very end, when the next shot will kill. This puts immense pressure on the other team, as if you grab the boss, you win instantly, not giving them time to respawn while you wait for your payload to get to its destination. A single won teamfight can get you the boss, which can end the game instantly.

It also depends on the present game-state and what characters are being played. If you play really strong pushers, ramming down their towers/keeps is powerful, but if you don't have a huge opening/aren't playing characters who are strong at pushing forts, taking the boss instead of pushing down at a keep you won't necessarily be able to take before the other side respawns can create additional pressure, as any sort of advantage on hits on their base make a huge difference. Also, if you already have taken their front forts, taking keeps can pull you more out of position/make you vulnerable in some ways.

In fact, that's the real secret of Hanamura - anything you do to get ahead puts the other team on the back foot in a real way because of the regular spawn rate of the payloads. If you can stop them from pushing a payload when a payload should respawn, and doesn't because they've already got two out, you have an advantage. If you knock down a fort more than them, you have an advantage. If you can grab the boss, you have an advantage. If you manage to knock down a keep, you gain an enormous advantage.

I think a lot of people obsess over the middle of the map, and it *is* important, but knocking down forts is actually really important on that map because gaining a shot advantage often puts the other side into a very difficult situation where they can't just trade payloads with you, they *have* to stop your payloads, which makes it harder for them to push their own.

A lot of their suggestions are outright bad. Starting the payload on the opposite side is bad because it creates worse gameplay, something a game designer would immediately notice. You want to have to push into enemy territory because it makes pushing the payload harder the further you push it. Increasing the core health would drag out the games; games being short is good. Likewise, decreasing the number of payloads would just make everything into a huge team fight, instead of the frenetic, all-over-the-map thing going on now which is actually what makes it unique-feeling.

I feel like the biggest problem with the map is the mercenary camps. In particular, I don't feel like the turret and spy camps are all that interesting to take (the healing camps a bit more so). While if you have bribe-type skills you can pull some nice stuff off, they just don't feel like taking them creates much pressure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sort of?

It is worth remembering that you have 2-3 altars spawning at the same time in a lot of cases. When that happens, you're looking at 2-3 shots. 2 shots, even with even towers, is 20% of health, and 3 shots is 30%. If you have tower advantage, it is even more.

Using "40% more" is kind of misleading. While it is true, in this case the most relevant thing is "shots to kill". Hanamura is no more than 7 shots to kill; Towers of Doom generally is 8-10 shots.

Hanamura's real difference is that rather than contesting over a common objective which, after winning it, you gain a benefit, both sides have their payloads spawn simultaneously, which makes it harder to defend. In Towers of Doom, if you trade altars, that's going to take close to 20 altars for the game to end, which is close to 10 altar spawns. Hanamura will end by the 8th payload spawn, because you will have 2 payloads out on the map, and no more than 1 health left on the towers, plus the boss to kill - there's just too many ways to win the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "You have the right to your own opinions. You don't have the right to your own facts."

 - Daniel Patrick Moynihan

What makes people delusional is not disagreeing with opinions. It is disagreeing with factual reality. If you start making stuff up, start insulting the other person instead of attacking their arguments, if you get upset when people cite facts and data which contradicts your position... yeah, you're either dishonest or delusional.

I may not agree with someone who suggests that the correct thing to do is to deregulate the entire economy, or abolish all government health care and ban health insurance in order to drive down prices, but as long as they actually agree on *facts*, then I don't think they're delusional. I might think that they're mistaken, and believe that they are drawing the wrong conclusions from the data, or that they are weighing their ideological stances too heavily in their considerations...

But when you are incapable of recognizing the factual reality around you, you are either delusional or desperately dishonest. Or mistaken about the factual reality (i.e. you are unaware of things), but if someone actually sources stuff at you, that's no longer actually an excuse. Doubly so when it is about an issue you apparently feel strongly about. I have a bumper sticker stuck to my wall next to my computer - don't hold strong opinions about things you don't understand.

If you hold a strong opinion about something you don't understand - something you lack a basic grounding in - you aren't behaving rationally.

When you actually just outright argue against things I'm not arguing, that's either a sign of a strawman argument (dishonesty) or that you are literally incapable of reading text on a screen in front of you and are instead creating things in your head (this would be delusion - you are no longer capable of perceiving reality).

Given how incensed you appeared to be, I assumed you were simply delusional. I suppose you might just be a liar, though.

Incidentally, thank you for conceding that I was right about everything by insulting me instead of actually addressing any point I brought up. It was a kind of transparent misdirection from someone who knows they have lost an argument, so I'd just like to thank you for admitting you were wrong about everything and that all you had left was trying to come up with some way to insult me and divert attention from that fact.

Just like your hero Mr. Trump. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I specifically called you an alt-righter and you can't handle that.

You're factually incorrect. Accusing someone who is a supporter of the ACLU, who voted for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, who supports cost controls on health care providers, who is generally opposed to many forms of tribalism, who has long been a supporter of civil rights (including gay marriage, something I voted for all the way back in *2004*, while many Redditors were too young to vote at all), of being a member of the alt-right is simply nonsensical.

 You post long pointless posts that all amount to nothing as if we can't see right through you. "blacks are violent thugs" "transgenders are mentally ill"

The problem is that you can't. You're completely incapable of even recognizing reality. It is the Dunning-Kruger effect at work.

You are yourself *deeply* bigoted. You think that if black people on average commit more crimes than white people on a per-capita basis (or even just in general), that racism is justified. As this is an empirical fact, you therefore go into denial mode about it.

The reality is that you can both acknowledge that reality and say that racism is bad. It isn't contradictory at all.

If you cannot deal with that, then there is something wrong with you. There is a sickness deep within you.

 In the real world people don't talk like you.

You must not spend a lot of time talking to academics, then.

Though of course typing is a different medium from speech, so there are certain important differences.

It was nice of you to concede this argument to me, though. By insulting me and claiming I am a member of (insert random hated group here), you have admitted that you have absolutely nothing of value to say whatsoever and that my statements must therefore be correct, as all you have left is calling a card-carrying member of the ACLU a Nazi. "Don't listen to this guy, he's evil!" is only something you say when the person is right.

After all, if they're wrong, it is easy to say "This person is wrong because of (insert fact here)." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is always hilarious to me how some people on the far left claim I'm a member of the alt-right, while the alt-right gets upset about how I'm some sort of "liberal loonie".

I voted for Hillary Clinton in both 2008 and 2016 and am a supporter of the ACLU. I'm center-left economically and am quite liberal.

As such, you are completely wrong about everything and should probably rethink your ability to actually understand the world, because you clearly aren't capable of drawing correct conclusions from observation.

You aren't living anywhere even remotely close to reality if you think I'm a member of the alt-right.

But I suppose, just like the alt-right, you think that anyone who disagrees with you must be a member of the exact opposite side of the political spectrum.

Ah, tribalism.

Ironically, you're quite a lot like Donald Trump and Ben Garrison. You may have different politics, but the underlying mentality that facts that contradict you are fake news?

You aren't so different, in the end.

If you think that human dignity is dependent on whether or not someone is mentally ill (as you and u/libertyisneverwrong believe) then there's something pretty profoundly wrong with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "You're a fan of a TV show? You must be mentally ill!"

Wow, you don't even know what a mental illness is. No wonder you don't understand.

I'd recommend looking up the definition of a mental illness before you ever argue about this sort of thing again.

Then again, I suppose it is the Dunning-Kruger effect in action - you cannot even recognize your own incompetence.

 You're a fucking brony and you think you have the place to tell transgender people that they're mentally ill and should just stop because muh "'"'facts'"'"?

I never said that transgender people should just stop because of facts. In fact, I never said anything about transgender people changing their behavior WRT being transgendered.

This is an indication of delusional behavior, given that you believe I said things that I clearly didn't, even though they're obviously visible on the very same screen you were typing them on. This is not a symptom of gender dysphoria; while people with gender dysphoria may be troubled by their gender identity not matching their physical identity, they are not delusional.

This is a problem which is quite separate from anything else you might be suffering from. I would recommend seeking out help, because you aren't even perceiving the real world around you; your brain is making stuff up that isn't there.

Fun fact: I actually roomed last year with a transgender individual at a brony convention, and I am friends with a couple of transgendered individuals. I chat with them fairly often and hang out periodically.

People are people. Having mental illnesses doesn't change that. I have friends with mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, and various phobias. It doesn't mean that I look down on them or see them as subhuman and cannot interact with them as though they were my peers.

You see people with mental illnesses as being subhuman. Your entire attitude shows that, including trying to brand me as mentally ill as if it were an insult. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Do you have support for those native American numbers because that on its face seems like ridiculous apologetics.

The US Census Bureau. It is an estimate; only about 25,000 deaths were actually counted, but it is doubled because we assume that they were undercounted by about half.

It isn't "ridiculous apologetics"; you have to realize that there weren't all that many Native Americans to begin with in the US. While Mesoamerica was densely populated, North America was not. Most deaths were caused by disease, not warfare, and even the larger battles with the Native Americans generally only involved a few thousand people to begin with. Consider that the [Creek War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War) only resulted in about 1,500 Native American deaths and the [Second Seminole War
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Seminole_War) only resulted in about twice that many, and those were two of the largest. Things like the [Bannock War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannock_War) only resulted in a dozen deaths.

Even the infamous Trail of Tears only killed about 4,000 people.

I'm sorry, but you have been systematically lied to.

In fact, the very fact that you don't recognize how reasonable that number is, instantly, means you should probably strongly question the people who have been feeding you your beliefs and everything else they fed you.

 Not by any reasonable history. The British straight up removed food shipments to famine struck areas in India and Bangladesh because of they hadn't it would disrupt there global trading system. Almost all modern historians hold that the British projected against minor famines but greatly increased the frequency and negative effects of major famines.

There isn't any historical consensus on it, I'm afraid. You've just been lied to by people who are trying to manipulate you into believing otherwise.

I am aware of this because I bothered to look it up. There are continued ongoing disputes over this stuff.

The reality is it will probably never be settled because it is impossible to simulate what India would have been like without colonialism.

It isn't that there's a dispute that shitty agricultural practices were in part responsible for the famines. The argument is over the blame that the British bear for it all. There's a difference between forced starvation and primitive infrastructure and technology and logistics and market failures. For instance, 5.5 million starved to death in Madras, but it was a natural famine. They believed that the market would solve the problem; it didn't and a lot of people starved.

But is that really the British's "fault"? It is very likely that a lot of people would have starved to death even in the absence of the British, as it was a natural famine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You aren't talking about statistics, you are talking about interpretations

Really?

How are these "interpretations"?

 Here's another challenging idea that might make some people uncomfortable in, say, a criminology class: blacks commit somewhat north of 50% of homicides in the United States. Or police officers aren't more likely to kill a black person than a white person in similar circumstances, according to several studies on the matter.

 Or you could go to a biology class, where evolution challenges your idea of how life was created by (insert religion here). Or physics, for that matter, that suggests that the history of the universe doesn't even resemble the religious explanations for how the universe came to be.

 There's a lot of ideas that can upset people. Even a math class might use an example to illustrate some principle, like determining the correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide and CO2 levels, or between gun ownership rates and homicide rates, that might challenge your beliefs about global warming or gun violence (there's a strong correlation between CO2 and temperature; there's no correlation between gun ownership and homicide rates on a state by state level).

That's data and statistical correlations.

And that is what upset you.

*Everything* about transgender people is interpretation. The idea that they even exist is interpretation, because there's nothing really objectively observable about people's gender identity. It is something subjective that we have to ask people about to get an answer on. I can't just stick a needle in your arm and say "Well, this person identifies as female".

And trans people lobby heavily against being seen as mentally ill because they are biased against the mentally ill. Being mentally ill does not make you a bad person.

Most of psychology is interpretation of subjective data. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  As America embraced christian ideology in its exterminations of the Indians.

This is one of those myths, I'm afraid. The US only killed about 50,000 Native Americans in the end; it was mostly a program of ethnic cleansing rather than genocide, and some of it was just regular old war. The Native Americans killed about 20,000 whites, after all, between battles and massacres.

 It how the UK embraced its capitalism in its starving of Ireland, India, Bangladesh.

Only about a million people died in Ireland. Not all of them were due to British policy. Pol Pot killed more people than that.

The argument WRT India is problematic because the British did a lot to *prevent* famines and to make their effects less bad. The argument that people were being deliberately starved en masse by the British doesn't really hold up.

 Both killed much much much more people than the Khmer Rouge

50,000 Native Americans is a lot less than 1.5-3 million Cambodians, and many of the Native American deaths were part of battles between states rather than genocidal actions.

It is difficult to point the finger at the British for a larger number WRT the countries listed as well; indeed, there is little consensus on how responsible the British even were for the famines, though generally more blame falls on them for Ireland.

 So I definately think it's worthwhile to point out Polpot was overthrown and his atrocious government documented by the Vietnamese communists.

Nah. It's just reverse cargo culting, and transparent at that. </TEXT>

 Castro

 Thomas Sankara

He showed ethnic favoritism towards groups he was a member of, and was a noted major human rights' violator. You know, torture, murder, extrajudicial executions - all the fun stuff.

	<TEXT> Wow. Your mental barriers are so strong you can't even see straight. You couldn't even respond to what I said and instead attacked strawmen. Maybe you should re-read what I said (also, note that I did not say that everything I said was absolutely correct, simply that they were things that could be brought up as counterevidence, which simply are not at times).

Gender dysphoria is a mental illness. Being transgender, in and of itself, is not a mental illness, but the distress caused by being transgender is one. Mental illness is defined by something being wrong with you; if you self-identify as the opposite gender from your birth but that causes you no distress, there's nothing wrong with you. This is why homosexuality got delisted as a mental illness, because homosexuality itself does not cause distress. Likewise with being transgender.

However, whether being transgender is actually any more physically meaningful than being, say, otherkin, has never been empirically demonstrated. The thing about crime stats is absolutely true; MtF transgender people commit crimes at a rate consistent with being male, not female.

I would bet money that you support people receiving treatment for gender dysphoria, such as hormonal therapy and surgery. If you genuinely believe that there's nothing wrong with them, then how can you possibly support treating their condition? This is an internally contradictory position.

That black people in the US commit a disproportionate amount of crime, including violent crime (indeed, especially violent crimes such as homicide and robbery) is incontrovertible. [The FBI statistics,](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43) [National Crime Victimization Survey stats,](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp tid=9) and local crime maps (like [this](http://heyjackass.com/2017-deadliest-hoods/) and [this](https://www.thetrace.org/2015/12/gun-deaths-interactive-map-2015/)) show it pretty unequivocally.

It is precisely because blacks are disproportionately likely to commit said crimes that blacks are disproportionately likely to be *victims* of said crimes; most crime is committed against members of the same race due to reasons of simple proximity (i.e. most whites commit crimes against other whites, most blacks commit crimes against other blacks).

It also amuses me that you objected to my points that would upset leftists, but you didn't object to my points about the things that the people on the right would object to. Indeed, you completely ignored the fact that I brought up global warming, evolution, and creationism at all.

Now isn't that interesting?

Your brain is desperately trying to prevent you from accumulating data which contradicts your deeply-held beliefs. You are *terrified* of absolutely true facts being presented to people, and believe that they must be wrong.

 It isn't useful to teach people "maybe black people are just more violent" because all that will do is spread misinformation and upset them.

It doesn't spread misinformation. That black communities have a larger crime problem than white communities is empirically true and it creates a lot of problems within those communities. It is why black people disproportionately are victims of crime - because fellow members of their communities victimize them.

It is convenient how a fact which upsets people will lead them to "wrong conclusions" (i.e. ideas you don't like) should be censored, but things which lead them to ideas you like should be presented even if they make people uncomfortable.

I will also note that only horrible people think that blacks committing crimes at a higher rate than whites justifies racism. It doesn't.

Transgendered people being mentally ill does not justify discrimination against them or being jerks to them, either.

But you seem to believe that people being taught these facts would justify these things.

That makes you more similar to bigots than I am.

People have sometimes accused me of being robotic or detached because I can look at stuff like that and not care. But the reality is that emotional detachment allows you to look at things objectively. People are people; statistical trends only tell you that the dice are biased, they don't tell you about any individual person. </TEXT>

The CIA supported the Khemer Rouge when they lost power because they were using them to destabilize the Vietnamese, just as the Chinese had used the Vietnamese in a proxy war against the US.

Yes, stripping people of capital and leaving them to die (which was something that Mao and Stalin did) is indeed equivalent to murder.

Indeed, stealing everything that people have is very evil. And of course, they murdered large numbers of people they didn't like based on their class, being intellectuals, ect.

 Many forms of marxism do not advocate a violent revolution.

All forms of Marxism advocate for violent revolution. Violence isn't just about killing people by stabbing them with pitchforks. Violence is the unlawful exercise of physical force or intimidation by the exhibition of such force. But even if you make it lawful, it is viewed as inherently unlawful if it violates people's inherent human rights (which includes property rights, the right to self defense, ect.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mao and Stalin - the two most democidal of communist leaders - did not primarily kill people via execution, but via mass starvation, social disruption, and internal (often involuntary) displacement. I mean, they executed a lot of people, or had them killed by various groups inside their countries, but the picture is larger than that.

Thus, in order to determine how many people they killed, you have to both determine the number of excess deaths, as well as the number of excess deaths which were directly attributable to their policies.

This gives pretty variable numbers, depending on how you count things. The "consensus" number for Stalin is about 20 million, but some counts go as high as 60 million. Mao's numbers are about twice Stalin's, ranging from 40-78 million.

The argument that this comes from miscounting deaths caused by Nazis is simply false. While I could see someone making that mistake, the mainstream estimates are not based on such stupid errors. Rather, they're fuzzy because the actual number of deaths is fuzzy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  1) Why do you think Marxists endorse Stalin?

Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, the Kims - these people were/are all Marxists and derivations of Marxism. It isn't about "endorsing" them, it is that the philosophy leads to atrocities because of its inherent nature.

 2) Inaccurate numbers. Saying that, Stalin was an ass.

The consensus number on the number of people Stalin killed via various forms of democide is about 20 million. The number of direct executions was only about 1.5 million or so, but his repressive, authoritarian policies killed a lot more people. Mao killed about twice as many people. Different people have different estimates because of different claims about death rates and the level of responsibility that the leaders in question held. Hitler's death toll is generally given around 12 million, including ~5.4 million Jews.

 3) As the dude said below, capitalism does kill if it works. Inequality and unemployment are necessary. Colonialism and imperialism was built on capitalism.

Actually, this is complete nonsense with absolutely no relationship with reality whatsoever. Sorry!

Inequality has nothing to do with capitalism. Inequality has to do with reality.

People are not equal. This is an objectively true fact; people are not all the same and do not have equal abilities. IRL, how many master artists who are also world famous novelists who also can create new drugs, program in every programming language, build rockets, design factories, and do everything else are there? None. People tend to be specialized. And moreover, most people can't do *any* of those things.

The reality is that the natural state of humanity is extreme poverty, and it is only via the creation and accumulation of capital that you escape poverty. This is why civilizations which create lots of capital are more successful than those which do not, and are wealthier and more productive than those which don't. This is easily observed in real life.

Different people, even within advanced societies, have different productivity levels. And this creates inequality, because people are inherently unequal. They just aren't the same.

Colonialism? Again, it has nothing to do with capitalism; colonialism predates the existence of capitalism by millennia, and civilizations across the spectrum of economic systems engaged in various colonialist and pseudo-colonialist practices.

The idea that inequality and unemployment are *necessary* to capitalism is also false. Capitalism doesn't care about either. You can have a capitalist society with zero unemployment and zero inequality. In real life, we don't see those things because both are results of empirical properties of reality, but there's nothing integral to capitalism which requires them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Marxism is only adhered to by monsters, seeing as it is a philosophy which centers around the destruction of capitalists.

In fact, it is more focused on that than Nazism is focused on the Jews; while Nazism was incredibly anti-semetic, the reality was that it was a philosophy of homogenization, nationalization, nationalism, and racial purity. The Nazis exterminated all those they considered defective - not only the Jews, but also Poles, Russians, Roma, homosexuals, and many other groups. Indeed, the Nazis killed about as many non-Jewish Poles as they killed Jewish Poles, something a lot of people forget, and overall, somewhat less than half of Hitler's victims were Jews.

There was more to Nazism than just hatred of Jews. Indeed, you cannot really create a state around the hatred of Jews; what does hatred of Jews have to do with territorial expansion or nationalization of certain industries or militarism? Not a whole lot.

Conversely, the destruction of capitalists is integral to socialist ideology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a straw-man argument. Insulting people is generically rude behavior and has nothing to do with calling you a tranny freak. They could call you a jackass or stupid or a Nazi or anything else, and it would be no different.

Here's the challenging idea that would make you uncomfortable: transgendered people are suffering from a mental illness, and when looked at via extrinsic metrics such as crime rates, appear to be more like their birth gender than their chosen one in aggregate, suggesting that their perception of their gender does not match their measurable behavior in various important ways.

Obviously, this isn't something which would likely be brought up in, say, a physics class. It is completely irrelevant there. But if you're in a psychology or gender studies class, is that not relevant?

Here's another challenging idea that might make some people uncomfortable in, say, a criminology class: blacks commit somewhat north of 50% of homicides in the United States. Or police officers aren't more likely to kill a black person than a white person in similar circumstances, according to several studies on the matter.

Or you could go to a biology class, where evolution challenges your idea of how life was created by (insert religion here). Or physics, for that matter, that suggests that the history of the universe doesn't even resemble the religious explanations for how the universe came to be.

Or you could go to an economics class, where pretty much everyone gets upset by at least ONE implication of economics.

The list goes on, but you get the picture.

There's a lot of ideas that can upset people. Even a math class might use an example to illustrate some principle, like determining the correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide and CO2 levels, or between gun ownership rates and homicide rates, that might challenge your beliefs about global warming or gun violence (there's a strong correlation between CO2 and temperature; there's no correlation between gun ownership and homicide rates on a state by state level). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The entire ideology is based around a false framing narrative of history, the idea that all of history is driven by class conflict. Moreover, it centers around the idea that the capitalists are robbing the hard work of the working class.

Why do you think that socialists killed 100+ million people in the 20th century? Why do you think that democide was so common in socialist societies?

It isn't coincidental. It is because the philosophy is inherently violent, promotes violence, and attempts to legitimize violence against those they hate, their perceived oppressors. </TEXT>

Then you're wrong.

 While technically the people being shut out have a right to speak their opinion, the people protesting are completely within their rights as well. So in my opinion, I don't think it is a good idea for college students politically but if thats how they want it I see no reason to complain.

The problem goes deeper than that, unfortunately. It isn't just about the protests, it is about what is spawning the protests and the toxic ideas of the far left. Some entire disciplines are full of insanity at this point at all too many universities.

 Not to mention the fact that these stories are often over exaggerated and pushed to make it seem like all schools are like this when in reality it barely ever happens.

Okay. How many conservative teachers are there at universities these days compared to historically?

This is especially bad in some departments, like English, gender studies, ect.

 the political and economic theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, later developed by their followers to form the basis for the theory and practice of communism.

Marxists killed more people than Nazis did (indeed, Stalin and Mao each killed more people than Hitler did), and what Pol Pot and the Khemer Rouge did to Cambodia was proportionally worse than what the Nazis did.

Marxists are horrible people. Marxism and its various derivations is a horrible, long since discredited philosophy/religion substitute. It is no better than Nazism.

Marxism calls for the extermination of capitalists, intellectuals, and many other groups. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a pacifist. Not in the least bit. So the fact that you are tilting off on that tangent already means you don't understand me in the least bit.

To be a civilized person, you must be capable of having a civilized conversation with someone you disagree with. If you feel like you have to attack someone because you are losing the argument, it means your argument is garbage. That's just the reality of it.

Marxists are uniformly evil. 100% of them. They are just as bad if not worse than the Nazis. There are rather more of them. If we are going to exterminate people with odious views, we should start with them, as they are the most numerous. Are you okay with that? If not, why not?

But where do you stop? Indeed, how do you even define an odious political view? Is it simply one which is in opposition to your own? If so, then the Nazis are justified in exterminating *their* enemies, and you lose all moral high ground.

Indeed, the very idea of political pogroms is a very Nazi-like thing to do (or Communist, or (insert authoritarian ideology here)-ist).

When Pol Pot agrees with you, that's often a sign you should *strongly* reconsider your position. While Hitler ate sugar, the specific basic idea that made people like Hitler horrible was the idea that attacking people who disagreed with his ideology/weren't part of his "in-group" was acceptable.

The fact that you are *literally* advancing that exact same basic argument - the very thing that made people like Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, ect. so monstrous - is a very, very bad sign indeed. Indeed, I've never met a single person who advanced this argument who was a good person.

And yet, every one of them perceives themselves as a good person. Funny how that works.

Ironic how they justify it in the same way, too - how their "opponents" who are "oh so evil" and are for "pacifism" are conveniently peaceful and disagree with the idea of the use of violence over political issues, and how it is oh so convenient for their opponents not to believe in violence.

And yet, these people are consistently the worst people in the world.

Indeed, how can you even define bad people? I mean, the most *basic* societal definition of a bad person is basically "someone who resorts to violence when they can't get their way by civilized means."

If we're going to exterminate the bad people, *why shouldn't we start with you*? </TEXT>

But the reality is that the issue being depicted here isn't entirely wrong. The problem of the illiberal, intolerant far left on college campuses is a real one.

So yes, I'm jumping in and saying that, because when you don't recognize that is what is being complained about, it means you're entirely missing the point. 100%.

The idea that this is about "normalization" is what is wrong with your entire mindset. The fact that you think this is about normalization of Nazis means you're missing the entire point of what is being complained about.

Here's the problem:

 So you just came to this thread, and projected whatever irrelevant feelings you have onto it.

That person who is doing that? That's *you*. You don't understand what is being complained about, so you're jumping in and shouting about normalization of Nazis. It isn't about that.

Also, punching people is simply inappropriate unless they are actually being violent. There's a reason why assault and battery are illegal. People have the right to advocate for their political views, even odious ones like Marxism and Fascism. It isn't legal to even punch *actual* Nazis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You really shouldn't cite Cracked as a source; they're... well, not one.

The original conception of a safe space is basically a place people can retreat to - a cooldown room or similar thing. They're meant to be quiet, low-key places. They aren't "places to plan". They certainly aren't classrooms. They're unchallenging spaces intended to let people who are stressed out to sit around in a quiet place in relative isolation so that they can recouperate.

A good example of this is something you see at Brony conventions - often you'll see a quiet space set aside somewhere in the convention space so that if someone is overwhelmed by all the noise and activity at the con, they have a quiet, isolated place to retreat to.

The safe spaces that people get upset about aren't these, and are *very much* anti-free speech things. The idea of a classroom being a safe space is insane and asinine - a classroom is not an unchallenging environment. A classroom should introduce people to new ideas, including ones they are potentially uncomfortable with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It quickly gets to be less of a "hey, surprise!" and more of a "let's be suspicious of all the things" and another step towards murderhoboism.

Nah. Nothing to do with it. Why would it? Murderhobos don't care. Really, I've not noticed any correlation, really.

 Could you give an example of another published game with as many trickery-type monsters that isn't a D D re-hash? Because I can't.

There are entire settings based around hiding from the general population and conspiracies. It is a huge thing in White Wolf games. I'm pretty sure Hunter is entirely based around hunting monsters who are hiding amongst the general populace.

 And that hasn't been my experience.

 *Lists a bunch of examples of exactly what I said*

Yeah, sorry to break it to you, but you listed off evidence for what I said. Murderhobo players are going to tend to play D D because D D allows for a decent murderhobo experience. Other games tend to be worse for it due to worse balance, though I've heard of murderhobo VtM games.

 The death of 4e was not "didn't get teamwork". The death of 4e was a bunch of edition wars on the internet because D D had the gall to kill off a few of the sacred cows that they've kept around and actually work to make a good RPG instead of a good D D game.

Nah. It was D D through and through. It was no more of a change from 3rd than 3rd was from 2nd.

The actual cause was a combination of bad licensing for 3.x as well as the fact that, yes, it required teamwork. In fact, that was by far the biggest problem I saw with people playing 4th edition - unlike most RPGs, it absolutely required teamwork. In most games, you can get away with ignoring what your teammates are doing a lot of the time. In 4th edition, not so much.

On top of that, it made the roles a lot more mechanically distinct - leaders were good at healing and buffing, defenders were good at tanking, strikers were good at dishing out damage, and controllers had powerful debuffs and battle control effects.

Many people did not understand this very well, especially the controller role. People who never understood the real power of the wizard in 3.x didn't get the 4th edition wizard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But you also said that you don't read reviews at launch

No, I said I don't buy games at launch, I wait. I sometimes will read reviews after a game gets launched, but I won't buy a game until it goes on sale months down the line.

 I explained why that is completely inaccurate. Go back and read through this discussion, and then come back with an original thought.

Nah. You explained why it is perfectly accurate, you're just upset at the characterization. There's literally no other point than to be misleading.

 3) because developers value those metacritic scores, if major reviewers are disrupting those scores, they will take the relatively minimal steps needed to stop the reviewers from doing so, and return to the standard practice of giving reviewers 1-2 weeks with a game before launch.

Nah, Metacritic will just stop using those scores. Why would they allow them to abuse the system in that way?

They wouldn't. They aren't stupid. Metacritic is a service to consumers, not to game reviewers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then you're reading shitty sources. The controversy over g is about the same as the controversy over global warming - it is ideological, not based in data. [The Wikipedia article makes note of its practical validity,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)#Practical_validity) and if you read things put out by psychometricians about it - stuff like *Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns* and *Mainstream Science on Intelligence* - groups like the APA note that *g* and *IQ* are widely seen as real and reliable and opposition to them is a distinctly minority view. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Ivy Leagues aren't *that* special. I know some folks who went to them and to other places; the quality of education at Harvard isn't any better than it is at, say, Vanderbilt, and it may actually be somewhat worse.

The biggest thing about Ivy League schools is connections and prestige. Not that they don't have great teachers (they do, though it depends on the program; some of the teachers at the Ivy League schools *are* nuts) but the difference between #1 and #20 in terms of teaching quality isn't that large.

But connections and prestige, there's quite a difference in some cases. Though really, Stanford is quite prestigious, CalTech is as well, ect.

It really depends on what you're doing.

Harvey Mudd isn't like, *not* prestigious, but it isn't any better in that regard than the Ivies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If reviews do not matter to you, then why do you seem so obsessed over when reviewers get their review copies?

I never said reviews don't matter. I said *individual reviewing sources* don't matter. I don't trust *anyone*. I read a number of reviews if I'm thinking about buying from a variety of sources, looking at scores from across the spectrum, particularly the lower ones, as they're the most likely to call out issues.

 But they explicitly TELL the consumer why they are doing that, and to ignore it if they actually want an accurate result. 

Why would you post an inaccurate score at all?

The only purpose is to mislead people. There's literally no other point.

There is just no defense.

 And again, it has nothing to do with "butthurt," it's about the developer not giving them the tools to do the job that the customers want them to do. This is not some petty insult, it is impeding their work on our behalf.

There's literally only two possibilities here:

1) Everyone ignores the scores, making it worthless.

2) Some people believe the scores, meaning that the reviewers are deliberately misleading people.

There are literally no other options here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The huge hard-on that D D has for trickery and deceit. That little old man that is harmless? Nope, actually an Ogre Magi. That treasure cheast? Mimic. That door? Crazy mimic monster. The nice lady helping you out? Hag.

The Hag and Ogre Magi things are mythic archetypes; it is hardly surprising that they're present in D D.

The mimic is straight up Gygax being evil.

The purpose of such things is surprise value. Most women you meet aren't hags; most little old men aren't ogre magi; most treasure chests aren't mimics. Running into the odd monster that isn't what it seems mixes things up, and also adds a bit of extra tension at times.

 Yes I'm aware these sorts of things exists in other games, but they are tremendously common in D D, noticeably more so than a lot of other games.

Not really. I see them in other games pretty frequently, even homebrew stuff. I played in one game where there was a running joke that our employers were always the bad guys; it was close to 50:50.

 Then you can start to get into the rules-heavy attempt at empowering players that 3.5 did, but that's a whole other conversation.

3.x's design goals were different from previous editions' design goals. 2nd edition was really very much about creating a certain high fantasy feel for the world via the mechanics, and played heavily on archetypes, while 3.x was much more focused on the heroes being awesome and customizable. 4th edition was focused on trying to set up exciting encounters and battles, and making for a more tactical game which heavily encouraged teamwork by both friend and foe.

 I've been playing TTRPGs for over 20 years, and I've invested huge amounts of time into making D D work. I've played 4 different editions, plus as dozen or more other games in varying degrees of investment.

And I have as well. Heck, I've even played and created homebrew systems.

 But when you compare something like 2e AD D and something like Dungeon World, you have wildly different degrees of antagonistic and competitive behavior inherent in the game.

I've found that people who tend to be antagonistic in one system tend to be antagonistic in all systems. The main differences I've found between systems is who is playing, not the system itself.

If you look at something like 4th edition, it is a highly *cooperative* experience by design; in fact, I don't think I've ever played another RPG which as heavily incentivized teamwork as 4th edition did. Likewise, its encounter design lent itself heavily to creating a challenging-but-balanced system as the DM, and making players feel smart as they picked apart encounters.

The thing is, though, I've found that regardless of those systemic incentives, players who were prone to ignore their teammates were prone to do the same in 4th edition. I can't imagine that it would do anything to dissuade railroading DMs, though it might disempower them somewhat (as it was much more obvious in 4th edition when things were wrong).

Those people tended not to particularly enjoy 4th edition, though - which meant that, in the long run, a lot of those players were turned off by it because they didn't "get" it. </TEXT>

Reckless driving. The guy was negligent in running over the body (a driver who was paying attention wouldn't have hit it). That said, they couldn't prove vehicular manslaughter because the motorcyclist may have already been dead at that point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason for the broader range, other than allowing more people to play together, is that 1000 SR in that range means about as much as 500 SR does in the higher-end games. This isn't really surprising; skill at the game follows a Pareto distribution, where ability scales much more sharply as you reach the top end of the distribution. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, Nixon definitely would have been impeached; impeding a federal investigation is a high crime or misdemeanor. That's why he resigned; he had no chance of surviving a vote.

He was a great president in some ways, but very badly flawed in others.

It is hard to beat the best presidents (the Roosevelts, Jefferson, Washington, and Lincoln), though he might have fallen within the next echelon (Truman, Kennedy, Eisenhower, Wilson, Jackson, Polk, LBJ). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [You're wrong.](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jsc/2011/858425/)

What raises risk of malignant melanoma is not simply straightforward exposure to UV, but rather, as [WHO notes](http://www.who.int/uv/faq/uvhealtfac/en/index2.html):

 The causes of malignant melanoma are not fully understood. Exposure during childhood is thought to be more important than exposure later in life. Tumour development may be linked to occasional exposure to short periods of intense sunlight, such as at weekends or on holiday. The higher incidence of malignant melanoma in indoor workers compared to outdoor workers supports that notion.

The FDA agrees with that assessment:

 "Melanoma incidence has consistently been associated with intense, intermittent sun exposure as opposed to chronic sun exposure such as that received by some outdoor workers."

Tanning beds are bad for this exact reason - intense, intermittent exposure to UV is the worst thing for your skin. </TEXT>
