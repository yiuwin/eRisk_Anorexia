	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's been almost a year and a half since I was violated and I just have no idea what to do. I can't handle it. I cry all the time, I have flashbacks, I can't handle being near other women (I've scared of them since the assault, and it's a pain because I'm a woman myself so everyone assumes I'll be more comfortable with them), it destroyed my relationship because I kept bothering my boyfriend with it and he left, I can't go to school because of it, I have no self esteem, I hate my body, it's not even *my* body, I can't handle sitting without my arms crossed over my chest, I cry every time I have to change my clothes or shower, I can't see doctors anymore, and I just want to feel better but it feels like I never will. I feel like it's my fault it happened because I didn't protect myself and I feel so much pain living in this body that's been made impure and dirty.

Is there anything I do to feel better? Please help me.  </TEXT>

I think rational anti-rape stuff is very important to be spoken though, and this doesn't seem like it's irrational SJW propaganda- it's just some badasses standing up to some dipshits. People need to keep speaking out against sexual violence, sexism (both misogyny and misandry), domestic abuse (by and against both genders), etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So what does he think about the violent taking of men when done off public grounds? Does he not realize that that would mean somebody could just walk into his own house and rape him with no repercussions? I mean I realize he's obviously very unintelligent because he believes that one's gender could make them inferior (there is literally no logic in any sexism, misogyny or misandry) but does he not even realize that that ridiculous idea wouldn't "teach women to lock their doors and be careful who they go home with" but that it would open men up to being raped in their own homes too? Or is he so stupid he thinks only women can get raped and rape can only be done by men?

No one should be dismissed just because statistically it's less common. All ignoring these issues does is make it easier for females to get away with it and harder for victims to get help.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, I have an honest question. How can a man support a group of people who do things like protest the building of men's shelters, advocate the myth that all sexual crimes are done by men to women, protest paternal rights, and then do little things like drink from mugs that say "male tears" knowing damn well if you drank from a mug saying "female tears" they'd call you a misogynist pig rapist? Or that they'd call you a misogynist pig rapist if you even speak to them in a tone they don't like or if you sit with you're knees apart on a bus? 

I'm a woman and I can't even get behind them because of how misandrist they are. 

Feminist was such a good thing when it started out, when women actually *were* oppressed (I'm talking about in first-world countries, I know there are oppressed women, but it's not the ones here in America crying about "man-spreading" and "rape culture" and complaint about it online are *not* helping the child brides and women who get beaten if they leave the house without a man) but now it's just a hypocrites movement that has become what it was made to stop- it is hate movement full of sexism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having an eating disorder. It is not at all like it is portrayed in the media. It is not being afraid of chocolate and ice cream and eating only 1/4 cup of salad and nuts every 3 days.  

It's not always a desperate fight with yourself. It's always not sad. It's not always full of anger. Its different for everyone who experiences it. And to some...*It's fun*. 

Yep.

It feels so fucking amazing to get to eat 4000 calories of whatever the fuck you want and purge it all away and be losing several pounds a month. 

It feels amazing to wake up from a fast, dizzy and floaty and high.

It feels amazing to be constantly receiving compliments and stares and such.

It feels amazing to feel so superior and perfect and so much better than everyone else. 

Sometime it's just counting calories of whatever food you like, eating anything but within moderation. 

Sometimes it's a hobby.

Sometimes it *is* just about losing weight. It's not always caused a trauma or a need for control or perfectionism. Sometimes it's just a quick way to drop a ton of weight. 

Oh, and sometimes it is a choice. Sure as hell was for me.  


And the bitch of it is...*recovery* is the part that sucks. Recovery is not happy and hopeful and it doesn't feel like taking your life back. It feels like losing everything you worked so hard to achieve, the destruction of an important part of your identit you, the lose of a friend. Getting better is what makes it hard. Having an eating disorder is amazing. Being forced to recover is traumatic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a court of law, absolutely there needs to be proof. But I feel like if you're just telling someone because you need to talk about it and need support *then* it's rude to ask for proof. Like if a friend tried to confide in you that they were violated and you ask them to prove it  you're an asshole, but in court, that's the only way to go: proof and evidence.

They (judges and juries and such) can't just blindly believe the victim- that's not fair. People are at times accused of rapes they didn't commit, rapes that didn't even happen, and those people should not suffer just because of an unrealistic ideal of always being believed.

	<TEXT> I had really severe chest pain for about three days (right up under my ribs on the right side and behind my right breast) most painful when breathing. It would make me dizzy, it would make me cry, it would hurt so bad I'd get nauseous and it was aggravated by exercising and laying down and I had a bad cough and pus from my tonsils and I would wake up in the night unable to breathe. It just suddenly went away though. Very relieving. I guess it must have been harmless because I'm fine and the symptoms are gone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I considered actually answering truthfully, telling her that I actually had been molested, just for the shock value and so maybe she'd feel bad about it and not bother me about children anymore but it's not something I like to admit in person. I'm not sure if in her mind that would make my choice acceptable. Maybe it would just affirm her apparent idea that not wanting kids = broken. One reason I can think of as to why molestation would make somebody not want kids would be because of the fact that you would would have to spend several hours, maybe even days (sole labors last like 48 hours right?) with your legs spread wide open as doctors and nurses look at you in ways that may be reminiscent of the trauma. And it would make receiving prenatal care stressful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the only way it might effect my choice is that I know if the child were female I wouldn't be able to bond with it. I think if I really wanted to have kids I could work around the trauma...see a male OBGYN for the prenatal stuff, do a home-birth to avoid the fear I would feel if I ended up being handled by female nurses in a hospital, and I could give the child the good early life I didn't get. I could experience childhood as it should be from a second-person perspective, but I don't think that would be worth it. I have so many reasons to not want to. 

That's why I think it's not a factor. I think I could get around the problems that would arise because of it (except the part about how if it was a daughter I'd never have any sort of bond with it, but I just now thought of that). 

And I'd already decided I didn't want kids before the really bad event occurred, that one that really upsets me. 

And it doesn't seem like you're raining on my parade, just discussing and making observations(: </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love crooked teeth. Crooked teeth are cute and sexy and natural and fun. I have *no* interest or admiration of manufactured pack-mentality perfection. This is why I am so resentful over being forced into braces at the age of 12 and made to stay in them for the 3 years that followed, and now at 16 I *thought* everything would be ok- I could just not wear my retainers and they would drift back to cuteness. I am now ugly forever. My face looks plain and unremarkable. The very worst part is that I can't even just not wear my retainer because the orthodontist *permanently glued* a metal wire to the back of my front teeth to make sure they can't move. It is painful and uncomfortable and I have to hold my mouth in an uncomfortable way to keep my tongue from being made to bleed by it. Even more frustrating is I cannot drive due to an anxiety disorder and vision problems, and because I live in a very back-woods, small town...we have *no* public transportation, so I can't get a job and work for the money needed to have the wire removed. But *I* shouldn't even be the one to have to pay for it. It should be the responsibility of the people who forced me to get an unwanted, unnecessary cosmetic procedure that only made me ugly. I will never be cute again. I will always be in physical pain. I am always so on edge because of non-relate issues and this just pushes me even farther. I am in so much distress over this and no one even cares, it doesn't matter that I'm uncomfortable and unhappy with it because "*ohhhhh but literally everyone needs to look exactly the same!! Why would you ever want a unique smile!?*"

Well guess what? I don't smile anymore. I am too ashamed of what my teeth look like now and in too much discomfort. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am so fucking *infuriated* by the thought process of some people when they find out I don't want kids. Some of the things they say and the conclusions they come to are just ridiculous and hurtful and straight-up stupid. Why can't they just accept that not everyone wants the same things as them? There is not tragic reason as to why...I just don't. 

I hate how many conversations go like this-

Judgy Condescending Close-Minded Individual with a Superiority Complex- "Ohhh Angel, what are you going to name your kids?"

Me- "I'm not going to have any"

JCCMIWASC- "OH MY GOD ARE YOU INFIRTLE!?!"

Me- "No."

JCCMIWASC- "Then what's  *wrong* with you?" *horrified expression*

Nothing. I just hate babies and children. They are gross and they take all your time and they decimate your life. All you can be is a parent then. And, oh yeah, *I just don't want to*.

Super-Conservative- "What!?! Why don't you want to hold Snexfleighke??"

Me- "I don't want her to throw up on me or drool on me or touch me or really be near me at all..."

SC- *smug smirk* "Well what are you going to do when you have your own kids?"

Me- "I'm not."

SC- "But don't you want to get married? You'll be alone forever. No man will want to marry a woman who doesn't like kids."

Why would I want to marry someone who would only want me for the purpose of pushing out babies? Maybe I would prefer a husband or wife who would want me because they enjoy spending time with me and care for the person I am, not just for a person who has a fertile body and the ability to reproduce?


And the icing on the offensive and inconsiderate cake:

Baby Crazy Mombie- "The greatest joy of being a woman is motherhood"

Me- "I don't want children. There are so many other joys in life."

BCM- "Why don't you want children!? Were you molested or something!?"

Yes actually, I was, but that has no bearing on whether or not I want to reproduce- and spoiler alert...I DON'T. Thanks for reminding me though, and I do so appreciate the implication that I *must* be *damaged* to come to such a sad and selfish choice to not reproduce /s

Why do these people think that there has to be something wrong to cause somebody to not want children? Why do they think those who are childfree will be lonely? Why do they assume that the only reason someone could *possobly* have to not reproduce must be a trauma?

It is just a lifestyle choice. There is no reason more than that I do not want to.

Having a smooth, hairless body makes me feel sexy and feminine and if I don't remove my underarm and pubic hair not only will I feel ugly, I'll feel like I'm not clean. Removing my arm hair and leg hair is purely for aesthetics though.  </TEXT>

The fact  hat there are single dads who are good to their children proves that not all men are monsters, and the fact that there are mothers who molest their children proves that some women are monsters.  </TEXT>
