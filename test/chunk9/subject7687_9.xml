	<TITLE> Hey guys, I'm finally moving out!! And I need any and all advice on how to make it less intense from all of you who have had the guts to do it? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm so nervous!! My bf and I finally signed our lease, paid the deposit/first month's rent and have the keys for our new place. He'll be out of town for the next few weeks, so I've been slowly buying things and moving things into this eerily quiet and empty place that I need to get used to calling "home". 


I still can't believe it's ours...I'm so happy I could die! :'). I get to decorate it how I like and pick out pieces of furniture, and I was even thinking about starting our own little garden! It just feels so right. That being said, with all of the excitement, of course, comes much anxiety when you come from a conservative Muslim family and do anything against their traditions/values. 


I have to say the most encouraging thing has been reading all of the stories of you brave women (and men) moving out and on with your lives. You're all truly inspirational! I am so indebted to so many of you and your courageous stories of your hardships and overcoming them and the constant updates :) You guys are truly awesome. 


Anyways, I was wondering if any of you could give me some extremely needed advice about this whole process, dealing with parents (especially a scary mother who is prone to violent outbursts).

I am actually extremely worried about our safety, especially if my family finds out where I'm living. I know for sure my mom will go ballistic and find me at work or school and try to follow back home. I just don't know what to do because laws don't really matter to her and she's said in numerous occasions that she'd rather have me dead than in a situation like this and would gladly go to jail if it meant she didn't have a daughter who did this.  


I am honestly scared, because she has a very violent past and can be very dangerous when she gets emotionally worked up. And I know for a fact even if I did get a restraining order or anything she simply would not care about the law and go ahead if she wanted to hurt me because her family/community would look at her as a better mother than if she would have allowed me to live.


Any advice from anyone who went through anything similar (with a crazy family and moving out) or about moving out in general?  Much appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As of now, I'm ambitious. I work with a bunch of people who are extremely passionate about becoming doctors, scientists, researchers. Seeing them work their ass off pulls me forward. I want a strong career. I want to be someone. I want to discover things. I want to go to bed every night feeling totally mentally and physically exhausted, but knowing I worked my ass off that day and tried my best in everything.



It wasn't until recently I realized you want the opposite of that. You dont mind working a job that just pays the bills and would feel no dissatisfaction with being stuck in one position for the rest of your life. You are complacent about many things, and it is reflective on your life style, where I have to beg you to eat healthier and exercise more. I don't even know what you are passionate about, besides eating and sleeping. You constantly complain about the unfairness of the world, and yet do nothing to bring about change or justice.
I am jealous of you. Because you are happy about the most simplest of things. You are satisfied with a life that's only purpose is to move on another day.


I don't think I'm better than you. And I don't think you're better than me. But Iguess I finally know what it means to be in different stages of life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems to be a course of action that some very desperate women take so they can at least act out their emotional and mental frustrations. I can only imagine how mentally disturbed I would be if I was living in a Muslim country with men all around me ordering me about, and me having to listen to their orders, and double standards without a way to safely rebel. Being subconsciously taught that women are inherently evil (the majority of hell is comprised of women), and stupider, and having to constantly watch my back to make sure people don't talk smack about my reputation, my family's reputation, my daughter's reputation, etc.  I'm surprised women over there don't do it more often.


I wonder why it is men don't seem to get "possessed" like this as often? Maybe because when life gets too stressing for men in Islamic countries, they can always just go home and take it out on their wives and children...and then that woman, who feels powerless is driven to do things like this to release her stress. Just a theory, but a very sad thought, nonetheless. 


If these women aren't paid actresses, then I feel really bad for them. They are obviously not "possessed". But it does seem like it's a way for some of them to vent out their frustrations and life stressors in a more "acceptable" way than admitting something is wrong or seeing someone for help, whilst staying within the confines of what is deemed more socially acceptable.


**Edit**


Also in some of these cultures there seems to be more empathy for a woman who is "possessed" than one who sees a doctor for depression or some other mental disorder. My father used to  beat my mother. Then she started acting out like this whenever my dad read Qur'an. After she started doing these crazy "possessed" things, he was much more gentler with her and never raised a hand at her again...He just reads her Qur'an when she starts "acting out" and is pretty patient with her ever since she started acting possessed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dude. I know exactly how you feel.  I've been told that I was "possessed" ever since I was an infant. It got really bad when I was a teenager like you too. It's complete nonsense. 


 I was also diagnosed with hypomania and depression a few years back. The only thing my mom can say is that "the devil is making me miserable and dragging you down to hell" and "god is torturing you because you are bad/don't pray". So I guess god and the devil are both torturing me at the same time. Does that make them on the same team??


She also always acts frightened whenever I come nearby and  says "bismillah!" all startled like. It's such complete lunacy. They don't see what THEY are doing and how it's negatively impacting us. I really hope you don't let it get to you. You only have a few more years (until you're 18) and I hope you're able to get out of that place! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ramadan is like the ultimate bully. It takes away your food, your energy, your happiness, makes you feel weak and powerless and makes you do a bunch of stuff you don't want to do (extra prayers, more religiousness) so that you don't get in trouble. Like a good bully, it gets people to do what it wants by instilling fear in them. 


Also, it makes me want to curl up and cry. 


Who ever though a month of starving yourself so that you can't do anything productive with your day was a good idea for a holiday?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A doctor's note won't be much help, because my parents think that my eating disorder is a choice and that I'm just being spoiled when I don't eat. Even if I got a doctor's note, they would me hold me in the utmost contempt for not fasting, because they are firm believers in the sanctity of fasting. My mother even suggested that my ex-fianc fast, even though he was diabetic. 


I don't really blame them. as they're your average Muslim family and were raised to not believe in mental illness. Just illnesses of the faith. My mom's solution to everything is to just pray. 


I've been planning on moving out for a few weeks now, but unfortunately, those plans have been falling off. :( I live in the U.S. I can't eat snacks or anything when I feel faint during the day, because my mom is very diligent in watching everyone during this time. She accuses everyone of having broken their fast and keeps her eyes peeled for any eating behaviors. 

So I'm just basically forced to be bed ridden during this month. With the exception of using every bit of my energy for tawareeh prayer, which I think is even tougher than the fasting itself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone. I have an eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. 


Anorexia means that throughout the year I struggle with trying to maintain a proper body weight. This began as a kid from teasing from mostly my mom and feeling as though I had no control over what happened in my life.


Basically I have issues with food restriction, calorie counting and purging behaviors. In a typical day, I don't eat very much, and when I do, I try everything I can to "get rid" of that food or the calories in that food. 


Throughout the year, I can usually stay at a relatively "normal" weight (read: A weight that allows me to run through the daily motions of life without feeling too sick/fatigued). But then comes. Ramadan. 


Ramadan kind of screws everything up. Because it is an anorexic's dream, and a recovering anorexic's nightmare. 



I'm sure many of you have experienced this. Not eating all day usually sucks the most in the morning and afternoon, but then as time passes, your stomach shrinks, and the signals telling you that you're hungry and you need to eat go away. 


This typically exacerbates my eating disorder behaviors, because I am forced to not eat all day, which is an anorexics dream come true. By the end of the day, when it is time to eat, I simply cannot eat because 1. I have no desire to because of the hunger signals fading out and my stomach shrinking and 2. my eating disorder is screaming at me to just not eat, and hold off for another day. 


My body feels like it's slowly deteriorating during Ramadan. 


By the end of this dreaded month, I'm a bag of bones and have to spend the next 11 months trying to recover from an even more intense case of anorexia and trying to prepare myself to survive yet another Ramadan.


I think I hate this month.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to add to the many graduation horror stories many of us have experienced; my mom slapped me in front of everyone during my high school graduation. We were walking to the building of the graduation ceremony. She was mad because I asked her to lower her voice while she yelled at me about something. 


It was really embarrassing because there were herds of people I had classes with walking by and she just stopped in the middle of it all and screamed at me and gave me a slap. 


Now I'm graduating college in 2 years. Would I like my mother to be present and celebrate in my accomplishments? Yes. Am I sure she will be a nice mom during that time? No. 


I guess time will only tell when it comes down to my decision of deciding to walk or not. My brother actually almost didn't walk because he was afraid of the way she would act, and surprisingly when faced with the threat that she might not be invited, she behaved herself. 


I know it's hard to have an open discussion with difficult parents, but take her aside when she's in a good mood, and really try to communicate with her about going to events when she's involved. Make it more about you and how you feel about it, so she doesn't feel like you're attacking her. 


Good luck, and don't feel bad not inviting a meanie to potentially ruin your day of fun. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, CONGRATULATIONS!! And you can do it!! I know its scary right now, and you're hesitating and wondering if its the right thing because they're bombarding you with messages and phone calls and guilt tripping you with illnesses. Don't fall into that trap... The SAME exact thing happened to me when I tried leaving the first time. They'll try anyway they can to get you back for the first few days. Make sure they have NO way of finding you.


After they've tried every possible way of getting you back, and weren't able to, they might chill a little, and want to compromise. They might say, "ok, were just worried about you and love you and if you come back we'll let you do this and this, just come back home because we want to make sure you're safe, and its wrong for you to be there with so and so..." whatever you do, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM. That was my mistake, and I regret it with every passing hour. Be strong, and stick to your convictions. Look at all the wonderful opportunities you'llbow have :)


Life was made to be lived. Don't look back, and please for the love of all things STAY SAFE. A Little word of advice, if your parents paid for your phone bill, or your account was with them, I'd change. It. ASAP. They definitely have ways to track your phone's location if it under one of their accounts (my mom did this).


I'm so very proud of you. If you need someone to talk to, or if it gets overwhelming and you need to vent, I've been through something identical and I'm here for you :)

Also, dont feel bad about the whole "this person got sick " nonesense. When I tried leaving last time, they told me my grandma was in the hospital, my father's blood pressure shot through the roof, and my mom was dying. Sure it's probably a stressful situation for them, but they are overdramatizing and using theatrics to guilt you into coming back. When I was stupid enough to go back, I found out my grandma was planning out a wedding, my entire family was doing fine health wise, and my mom had just lost a little weight, which, quite frankly she needed to.


Also, I wouldn't mention the whole not Muslim thing right now if I were you. If they needed a boost or reason to harm you or honor kill you, that would be it. For your own safety, I wouldn't tell them until things cool down and they accept your decision, that might take a few years, or possibly be never. </TEXT>
