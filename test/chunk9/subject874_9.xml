	<TEXT> I have it and love it. The traditional masks never got a good seal on my face, and it really makes life much easier for a beginner snorkeler like myself. I have never had any water get in the air pipe, and I could even have a pretty strong 5 o'clock shadow and still keep the seal on my face. It is possible to dive a little with it, but it adds resistance with all the air it keeps inside. The most annoying thing about it was that it distorts the view a bit and makes distances hard to judge. I plan to get a more "advanced" mask someday, but this takes all the pain out of snorkeling! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently switched from in-office to remote, and I work for a consulting firm with clients mostly in other states anyway. I was able to keep the 165k salary (minus travel expenses) provided my work quality remains high, but the cost of living didn't really change when I moved so no real advantage there. Here is my personal pro/con list for the short time I've been remote:
Pro:

1. I was able to move to Hawaii (Kona) from California (Orange County). Ocean view from my home office!

2. I can be around my family more often (wife and 2 young kids)

3. Save money/time commuting, eat healthier and cheaper at home

4. Less interruptions from co-workers

5. I can use my own computers when the company equipment just isn't up to the task

6. Play my music without headphones

Con:

1. I'm giving up some management opportunities (but I'm actually not very interested in that at this company). 

2. I have to fly back to the office about 6 times a year for a week at a time, and those flights/cars/meals are deducted from my pre-tax pay at the end of the year (I have no idea if that's normal). It does discourage me from coming out, so it doesn't make a ton of sense, but I believe they will probably make it up to me with a higher bonus if I do well.

3. I calculated that I can make up that pay cut from #2 with an extra 30 minutes of billable time per day, but I'm finding it hard to work the longer hours when my family is just in the other room.

4. There is added pressure to "prove" that you are contributing to the company. I create an all-day appointment in my work calendar (which is shared) every day I work with the goals for that day at the top and then update with the results at the end of the day.

5. I feel like I'm not learning as much, but at this point I'm pretty much an expert on the tools/language we mainly use so at this job I don't worry about that too much.

6. I expect I'll have to move back to the mainland if I switch jobs, so I'm tied to this company for now. I have very high job security, but job satisfaction is at maybe 75%. Considering I can live in Hawaii with a high salary, it makes up for the other 25%.

7. The time difference means I have to start pretty early each day (6-7 AM depending on daylight savings). I'm not really a morning person, but I'm off at 2-3 PM most days so plenty of daylight for the beach.

edit - formatting... gotta figure that out someday </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Glad to hear it, I was thinking about you during our family Christmas festivities, but I have no idea what you look like, or even if you are a guy or a girl. I'm moving right now so I find myself sitting down going through old papers and reminiscing about life when I was single and could do anything I wanted. I'm married now with kids, so my chances to go do something spontaneously are basically 0, but I do have the most adorable kiddos (and doggo) plus a wife who I dearly love as well.

We are actually moving to Hawaii, which is exciting, but shipping all our stuff there, selling a car, renting out our house, and not taking any time off from work have culminated in an absolutely crazy week of errands and no sleep! All this hassle better be worth it... </TEXT>
