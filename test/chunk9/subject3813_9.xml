	<TEXT> We have a large dog, and I am afraid that if we kept them in the house he would try to play with them and accidentally injure them. Thank you for the advice

	<TITLE> Help! Brand new bunnies escaped last night </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My family adopted two three month old lionhead rabbits yesterday. Apparently between last night and this morning they both managed to escape! There were no tears or holes in the outdoor cage, but maybe they squeezed through the wire? We've left their cage open, put food out for them, set a live trap with treats, checked under places they could be (under the shed, in the garden, ect), and asked the neighbors if they've seen them. No sign of them so far, but I am trying to be hopeful. They don't know us or the cage yet because we only just got them yesterday. What else can we do? Please help, everyone is quite devastated. :/ 

edit: Bunny number one(Buttons) is home safe and sound! She was eating food in her shelter. Poor thing was wet and terrified but she is safe! She is resting quietly in the house until we can be sure they can't get out again.  No sign of her sister Butterscotch but we are very hopeful she will come home to find her sister. It looks like they were able to squeeze through the wire.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, thank you so much for taking the time to write such a detailed and helpful reply! Stony Brook is my number one choice, if I can get in. That was actually really reassuring to me, my grades aren't stellar(3.2) but I do have extracurricular activities and shadowing experience. Best of luck to you as well!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Where to find statistics on acceptance into accelerated BSN programs? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been searching high and low for statistics on who get accepted into the accelerated BSN programs (specifically Stony Brook, Hunter, Lehman and Suny Downstate). They're obviously competitive, but exactly how competitive are they? What GPA does an applicant need, what percentage get accepted, ect, ect. If anyone could point me to a website with that information that would be wonderful! Thanks in advance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good point about the research, that really does seem important. Im currently at a state school and don't really know what I want to do after graduation. No research experience, but I'm working on finding a lab that will take me.

	<TEXT> *Obviously talk to a tattoo artist, they will know more than random internet people*

I have a tattoo that covers scars on my leg, it worked very well. (http://i.imgur.com/p3F6M.jpg)
The scars are now covered, but there were several. All about four years old, white and raised. The tattoo is 8 months old, no trouble with fading. With the pain factor, I didn't notice a difference. Try to find an artist that has experience covering scars. Done well, tattoos can cover lots of scars. Done wrong, it can highlight them. Do you have an idea tattoo you want to cover it with? 

Generally speaking, it will look better if you get a tattoo that works with the scars, rather than just blacking them out. Here(http://guycodeblog.mtv.com/2012/11/15/tattoos-incorporating-scars/) are some good examples of such tattoos. Here(http://www.tattoomafia.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=trees.pageDetails p=838-49-1135) are some more. This(http://dragonflyink.com/custom-tattooing/scar-tattooing/frequently-asked-questions-about-tattooing-over-scars/) is a simple QA about tattooing over scars. Here(http://www.ultimatetattoofinder.com/Can-a-tattoo-cover-a-scar.html) are some things to conider before getting it done. It might help to talk to a dermatologist about if the scars are truly done healing before talking to a tattoo artist. 

Best of luck to you </TEXT>
