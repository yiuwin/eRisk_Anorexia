	<TEXT> I 100% agree. Especially the security guard who tried to take my phone. I was appalled. I can see taking it from a student if they are in class taking a test and won't stop using it or are being an extreme nuisance about it, but I was answering a text in the hall. Like, what the fuck? Even if I was a student... that one ticked me off.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get stopped in the halls during class and yelled at. I have people yell "where is your teacher?!" When I'm sitting right there at the teacher's desk. I've had a security guard try and take my phone. I've gotten multiple threats to tow my car for parking in the faculty parking lot. 

The kids are constantly trying to find out if I party or smoke weed. 

I'm a high school substitute teacher and I'm 29. (I sub at multiple high schools so security/other teachers don't always recognize me)

EDIT: I want to add that I love my job and most of the time I don't get yelled at, I just have gotten yelled at before, for being in the halls during class time before or for sitting at the teachers desk or parking in the faculty lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a substitute teacher. I love it. I know a lot of people hate it but I would do it the rest of my life if it paid well, but it doesn't. Every time a kid walks through the door and sees me they get excited. Imagine making 120-240 kids happy every day! 

I have gotten to know the kids at the main high school I sub at pretty well. I help them with their work and even get to teach sometimes. They ask me for advice, most of them adore me, I get to know about their lives and struggles and offer encouragement. I care about them so much. 

I don't have to give them grades or teach them a bunch of crap just so they can pass a standardized test. When I get to teach I get to do it my way and there is no resentment from them because I don't have to flunk them or get them in trouble. I can just teach and listen and help with zero responsibility or consequences. 

But... I can't keep living on this sort of wage so at the end of the month I'm taking my teaching certification. 

After that, I will crack the whip when I have to and I will get them in trouble if I have to, and I will flunk them when I have to... and I'll still care because I want to. I'm a good sub but those things make a good teacher and I want to be the best that I can for them because I want to see them succeed. 

And I'll teach standardized tests because the district will make me:  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't my story, I read it in Reddit years ago and laughed my ass off.

This guy goes to the gym. Now the gym had previously had one of those water fountains was made specifically for refilling water-bottles quickly (something like this http://www.elkay.com/lzs8wssp#3 ) but it had broken so all they had was the standard water fountain.

Anyway, after his workout he goes to get a drink of water and there is a black dude filling up his water bottle at the standard fountain. The guy has to wait a while for this guy to finish filling up his water bottle and makes small talk by saying "you know, there used to be a separate water fountain for you guys"

The dude turns around and gives him the DIRTIEST look and walks away. Only then did he realize what he had said. 

I'm paraphrasing because it's been ages since I read it but that was the general gist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom changes religions every few years, each time she becomes bat-shit devout. 

Last time she converted to Judaism and went on a fruitless hunt to PROVE she was Jewish by blood. She dug deep enough and found a few last names in our family history that MIGHT be Jewish. Even if they were, it would only make her like 1% Jewish, but for her, that's enough to feel special. Whatever. She's harmless. 

Now she has switched from believing In God, to believing in aliens instead. I mean, sure I think there's life out there somewhere, but like everything else, she's REALLY into it. She thinks our civilization came from aliens and that we worshipped them as gods and that they are still watching over us and will come back when they feel we are ready. 

At dinner last week, my mom mentioned visiting her mother (my grandmother) and how she told my mom that she thought her relatives had paperwork from when they lived in Germany specifically stating they were NOT Jewish during WWII. According to my mom, this proves she's Jewish because they were "hiding" the fact that they were Jewish. 

I responded to this by saying "do the aliens care if you're Jewish mom?!". Now everyone thinks I'm mean...\_()_/  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ex husband cheated on me seven times. I was young though and I had a bad childhood which caused self esteem issues. We also had a kid (I still have her but he is uninterested in being a parent now so it's no longer a 'we' thing) 

First time I found out, the girl my ex was cheating on me with, called me to try and fight me for him. After that I was suspicious of everything he did so Over the course of 4 years I was constantly catching him by invading his privacy and never trusting him. I do not like what I became with him.

Going through his email, phone, Facebook. Twice he put an nice new picture in his Facebook and I ran it through google and found the same picture on dating web pages. It was toxic and horrific. I was an idiot for staying so long.

Once I went on a trip with my mom for four days and he threw a house party. All his friends on his Facebook kept calling him the "beast slayer" so I went through his phone and found out they were teasing him for screwing a really large girl in our bed. (As someone who has been fat in the past, I feel sick that they called her that, and I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just explaining the story.)

One time I'm made a fake dating profile on the same site I saw his at and chatted with him for like a week and got him to admit he was married. Then I said "I don't want to be a home wrecker if you've never cheated before" and got him to go on and on about all the times he had cheated on "his wife" in the past to try and convince this fake girl I was posing as, to sleep with him because he had already good and fucked up our relationship. Classy right? That's when I found out he had fucked my best friend/ college roommate, cause he bragged about it to me thinking I was some random internet girl.

Once I came home from work early and found him fucking my ex girlfriend. She was super drunk so I drove her home. She had been hanging around outside of our apartment looking for me because she was still hung up on me, so he let her in and ended up fucking her. She had been in and out of mental hospitals around that time, so I was mad at her, but it was pretty much all his fault because she was clinically insane and I had gone no contact with her two years prior (before I met my husband) because of it. 

My current husband is wonderful. He got repeatedly cheated on by his ex wife too. He and I have reeeeeallly great communication and understanding and have a 100% open policy with each other's electronics/phones/emails, but have never had to use it because we are so transparent. It was the only way either of us could learn to trust again.  </TEXT>

I say "first" because I had one in college for about 9 months (small tank, no filter or heater, I was young and stupid) and my cat ended up eating him. That was 8-9 years ago and I got this one from a Walmart in a whim over two years ago. 

First I had him in a small tank and then after 6 months I started reading up on why his fins were shredding. Ended up slowly getting him a good setup, though I never cycled the tank. I didn't know about that at first. Anyway, he's super healthy and happy I hope.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My husband is ten years older than me. (I'm 29 and he is 39, we met when we were 24 and 34). All of his previous girlfriends have been younger than him (between 4-7 years) so it's definitely a pattern.

For starters, I sought him out. I feel like just as many women seek older men as older men seek younger women. This might be unpopular to say in this sub, but I needed someone who could handle my baggage with me.

My ex husband and I met at 18 and I got knocked up at 19. I continued to mature, finished college, worked my tail off and he just wanted to keep smoking weed and playing video games all day and wanted me to support him (I have no issues with weed and video games but that was all he was about). After we divorced I dated another guy around my age and he was sweet but (although he denied it over and over) was NOT ready to be a step-dad. 

After him I decided to aim for a higher age bracket for a guy who was already a dad and knew what it involved. That's not to say I just picked someone to father my kid, but once you have one (and want a serious relationship) you HAVE to factor in that the guy you are dating will play some sort of role in your kid's life.

We fell head over heels for each other and things are wonderful. He is mature where it counts (goals, responsibility, financial planning, common sense) and immature in ways I like (sense of humor, playfulness, what he does in his leisure time). 

I think if you factor out physical reasons like looks, a lot of men seek younger women because there is a higher chance of them finding someone they mesh well with in the younger age group. Same for women seeking older men. Age really is just a number, you just up your chances of finding what you want when you aim for a certain demographic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to lose weight because if you are fat no good man will ever love you. She said it often.

Might not seem that bad but I didn't lose the weight until I was 25 and by then I had had two extremely abusive relationships that utterly wrecked me as a human being. I took them because I thought I needed to take any 'love' someone would give me because that was all I could get because I was fat. I also developed an eating disorder that put me in  the hospital where doctors said they thought I might die and had to have emergency surgery. 

I met my now husband while I was still fat and I lost the weight (140 lbs) while with him. (In a healthy way) He is wonderful but I only found him after I decided I was worth a good man at any size.

My mother was not a horrible person. I love her and she has grown a lot since I was a kid. Still, be careful what you say to your kids. It can really fuck then up.

I only watched a co-worker mess with someone's food once in my entire career.

They came in the next day and requested his ex's section so they could be all lovey-dovey in her face and run her like a dog. The manager let it happened because she had no sack. Soooo ex gf licked her toast and I saw her do it and honestly, she had my blessing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who has worked over a decade in the service industry, here's what runs through my head when someone comes in seconds before closing (stores, restaurants whatever)

"Uggg really?"
"Man, I wanted to go home on time"
"That person is rude or never worked in the service industry"
"Maybe they didn't know we are closing?"
Or, if they are old
"Maybe he/she is too old to care"

NEVER have I said anything to them about it. We were not closed yet, and as much as it sucks, it's my JOB to stay open until closing, at which point I can deny service (and maybe feel childishly snarky when I get to turn people away)

NEVER is it alright to degrade someone for any reason, race, gender, class, ANY reason. Yes, the guy may have been pissed about what happened but make no mistake, he's a racist asshole and there is no reason for him to behave that way and he should be fired. My advice? If the supervisor didn't take you seriously, go higher up. Call corporate. This is not cool.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> High school substitute here. 

If you are in high school this meme is not for you. It's different for different districts, but there is a point where you can be late enough that it counts as an absence. Check with your teacher/district when that cutoff is. 

Also, *some* schools in my district want subs to turn in the physical roster within the first 15 min of class while others let me hold onto it until the last 10-15 min of class (it's up to the individual school what their policy is) so if you are more than 15 min late at those schools, but still under the "so late you are absent" cutoff, chances are I marked you absent and there is no way for me to get into the roster system to change it.  </TEXT>

I was telephone tech support for directv and we had to have the script open, customers info, the known issues page, the order page, the technician's schedules open for that area, the package tracker tool, the DTV web page, company email and several others open at once. 

They made us do that because the internet at work was so slow that the calls would take too long if we made the customers wait for us to open and load a page. After doing that I got used to having a lot of tabs open at home. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a 3.0 in college and now a 4.0 in grad school. Honestly? My anxiety got much worse and that is what did it. 

I don't procrastinate anymore. I will sit there and worry about getting a project done over and over until I do it. I think doing that long enough eventually lead me to realize that if I got stuff done as soon as it was assigned then I didn't have to worry about it anymore.  It's slowly bleeding into other parts of my life.

For instance, I had a huge (massive) "to do" list that I needed to get done and I had both today and tomorrow to do it. I woke up really early this morning and worked on it until late in the evening and got everything done in one day except the dishes from the two weeks' worth of meal prep I did today. I'm exhausted and I'm laying in bed but I can't sleep because I *know* the dishes need to be done and it's driving me crazy to the point where I most likely won't be able to sleep and will end up getting up to do them shortly.

I feel like a wheel that keeps spinning faster and faster and eventually I'm going to shoot off in a million different directions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm terrible at keeping up friendships. Whenever I make a new friend at work or in grad school I think "great, it's only a matter of time before this lovely person resents me for what they perceive as me ignoring them."

I have three jobs, a kid, a house to run, a husband who works more than I do, a rigorous workout schedule, graduate school and severe depression (the working out helps combat the depression and if I don't do it I'm nearly nonfunctional.)

I have no TIME for you and even on the off chance I have a free evening I want to spend it in bed with my husband and watch Netflix and hide from the world.

My best friend lives on the opposite side of the country and we talk extensively on Facebook and through texts. We met in high school and then she moved far away. It's the PERFECT relationship. I've seen her twice in the last five years and the last two times she was in town (because her parents live here) we didn't even meet up. It was wonderful.  </TEXT>

My point is they purposefully hide it in the hope that the customer will miss is so they can screw them. That's shitty and unethical business. Illegal? No. And I know plenty of businesses do it but it doesn't make it right. 

There are several DTV people on here who are arguing that they were very up front with their customers and that's great but as far as I could tell from my end that was the exception and not the rule.  </TEXT>

You aren't the one who had to talk to the single mothers who couldn't pay the bill once it doubled and canceled the service only to have a 400$ fee auto-withdrawn from her account so she couldn't feed her kids that month and told her "sorry bitch, it was on page 38 sub section C foot-note 7 that says we can basically rob you blind."

	<TEXT> DirecTV locks you in a 2 year contract and after one year all the "new customer discounts" fall off and you are stuck paying more than double what you were quoted. If you cancel your service early they can charge you hundreds of dollars and they use any card you have ever used to pay your bill to auto-charge it to your account without even asking you. It's in your contract when you sign it in the fine print that you are allowing them to do this.

EDIT: to all the people saying you should read everything you sign, yes you are correct. Now ask yourself if you read every word of every thing you ever agreed to. I'm talking about every hospital "sign here" form, every updated terms and services on Facebook, all the conditions listed when you update a device or download an app. Companies make contracts long, hard to understand and hide things just so they can fuck customers over and that's legal, but it's wrong.  </TEXT>

I'm noticing a trend at times on Reddit that when someone is telling a story there's always one asshole who has to take the unrepresented person's side. 

Like, someone might tell a story about their terrible mother who beat them and someone will be like "she wasn't beating you she was trying to raise a good child." Even though NONE of the story-tellers story indicated that. They can't just take the OP's word for it, they have to argue on behalf of a person who isn't there, for the other side that they haven't heard. I don't know, maybe because they identify with the perp and are projecting? 

"My husband used to cheat on me so I dumped him."
"What if he was suffering from depression?!"
"He wasn't." 
"How can you possibly know?!"
"I lived with him for ten years."
"YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM"

I worried about it for years before I finally got it taken care of. It worried me to death though. Please don't do what I did. Just go to a doctor and have them take care of it. It's nothing to be ashamed of, shit happens. Even if you are sexually active, I think doctors have to be discrete about stuff like this. (I think.

	<TEXT> I'll be 29 in February so I hope that counts.

I'm a high school substitute and many of my students  are 18 and I've been hit on multiple times. It's cute, but in no way shape or form am I tempted to engage, even if I was single. One, because I'd lose my job but also because there is no desire at all. They come off as children to me. They pretty much are. 

Yes, some kids are more mature than others but the amount I didn't know at 18 that I knew by 25 could fill several books.most of it has to do with life experience not stupidity. 18 year olds are so impossibly naive. Sure there are exceptions but I honestly wouldn't even entertain the idea of dating one long enough to find out if they were one. 

To top it all off, I personally prefer older men. My husband is 39. I'd even date older than that if I were single. Although I prefer older men, I can totally understand why, say, a 50 year old woman would date a 30 year old man. The older you get the less maturity difference there is between the years. I met my husband when I was 24 and he was 34 and things were great. They wouldn't have been if I was 18 and he was 28. I was a completely different person then. I had so much growing up to do.  </TEXT>

NO

I'm the cool girl OP. Although I would be uncomfortable with my husband going to a strip club, I would not consider it cheating, just an opportunity to tell him to stop doing that. 

Seeing one stripper in particular??! Following her around?!?! In constant contact with her?! And she dances naked on his lap? Hun, that's not "going to a strip club" that's "in some sort of weird relationship with a stripper." 

I'm the cool girl. I wouldn't put up with this. You are not breaching on "cool girl" status you are in "doormat territory." 

I don't tell people to break up. I don't know him or you. On top of that, if you have been acting cool about all this up until now, he might have deluded himself into thinking his actions are alright. You need to sit him down and tell him to cut all ties and don't go to strip clubs anymore (it obviously bothers you and he obviously is incapable of knowing how to behave with strippers) and if he continues, tell him you are gone. Don't let him treat you like a doormat. Your wishes and happiness are just as important as his.  

Tell him he needs to stop or you are gone. Period. Full stop. At least that's what I would do. That or just leave now, but once again I don't know you guys so that's at your discretion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every new relationship has that exciting exhilarating bubbly butterfly feeling. That eventually goes away and leads into much deeper, calmer, real love. The strong kind. The long lasting kind. 

You can break up with your current guy because you don't feel the heart-racing infatuation anymore and chase the new guy that makes you feel that way, but rest assured that if you stay with "new guy" long enough, that feeling will fade too and you'll keep bouncing around forever chasing infatuation. If that's what makes you happy, fine, but don't cheat on people. Leave who you are with before you hop to the next quick-fix fluff. Also, be a peach and let every guy you date from now on know that you are shallow and are going to move on as soon as the butterflies go away, that way they can decide if they want to waste their time on you or not. 

Some people just are not that deep and that's okay. I personally think you should leave your current bf. not because you'd be happier but because he deserves better than someone who has *already* cheated on him. 

If your life plan includes eventually settling down with a man you love for the long term, then you have some serious growing up to do. I'm trying not to come down on you too hard because you already know what you are doing is wrong but it's hard because... you KNOW what you are doing is WRONG. As someone who got divorced because my husband was a serial cheater, you have no CLUE how much your selfish actions are going to destroy him sooo.... yeah. You are selfish and he deserves better. 

You are not gods gift to men and your current boyfriends life is worse off having known you and you need to face that and own up to what that says about you. Then if it bothers you, change. Human beings are pack animals. On top of that we are sentient. You don't just hack your way through life only considering what you want and what is best for you, you be a god damn human being with a heart. You know, unless you are a sociopath.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's silly. You are addicted if your practices are adversely effecting your life. It takes an adverse effect for people to try to stop anyway. I think most people could stop for 2-4 weeks but don't feel the need to try and stop because, why? Why when it's perfectly natural and harmless? And it is harmless for 99% of people. If you had to stop because it had consequences in your life it's no reason to feel superior to other people who are not addicted and not wrecking their lives over it in the first place. 

It's like a recovered alcoholic judging people who can have a glass of wine at dinner without going crazy and ending up in jail.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was working as a waitress and one of the head cook's best friends used to come in all the time and hit on me. I ignored him though because I was married.

My husband had cheated on me several times with several different women, but I was 19 at the time and he had not cheated in a while, so I thought everything was going to turn out alright. (Yes I was an idiot.) 

Well one day I discover that hubby is cheating again. I call him on it and he shrugs it off like "so what?". He didn't seem to see why it hurt me *so much*. Another thing that bothered me (although much less) was how these women could possibly sleep with a guy who they knew was married. 

Well I marched off to work and got the cook's best friend's number and called him. He told me to come over at "x" time in the middle of the day and that I had to leave by "x" time. It seemed odd but whatever. I went over and noticed kid's toys all over the living room. Also pictures of him and some girl. He told me it was his sister and her kid. 

Anyway I fucked him and then went directly home and told my husband. He was devastated, which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted him to see how much it hurt. 

Went to work the next day and felt odd about the picture of the girl and the kid's toys and asked the cook if his friend was married. He was. 

So I was the other woman *and* cheated on my husband with the express intent of hurting him. Sure the guy lied to me and said it was his sister but in retrospect if I had even stopped to *think* for two seconds I could have figured out he was lying. Before that I never would have believed I would have done something like that. My husband was the only guy I had ever slept with before that. 

Obviously I'm divorced now but it still bothers me that I can't say I've never cheated on anyone because of that one hate-filled emotionally-driven incident. Before and after I have always wanted to think I was better than that. I'm almost 30 now and it still irks me.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although I agree that there are people (like you) who don't watch porn, and I believe that you don't and should not be downvoted, I disagree with your guess as to why you are being downvoted. 

Not watching porn is a preference. It is not an accomplishment. There is nothing wrong with watching porn. If you had to "quit" watching porn the way some people need to quit doing things they are addicted to, then you obviously had a problem. That doesn't mean other people can't use it responsibly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Relationships are built on trust. Period. 

You either trust him or you don't. He cheated on you and you decided to stay so you either make a commitment to trust him and do it, or you dump him. Cheating can kill a relationship in more than one way. Either someone cheats and it's over and the relationship dies quickly OR someone cheats and you never trust them again and the relationship dies a slow and painful death. Relationships cannot live without trust. Period. 

The only way this will work is if you forgive him 100% and trust him completely again. That's hard to do though considering he already proved to be untrustworthy. I personally couldn't do it. I took the long rout and tried to work it out with my (now) ex husband and just ended up wasting more time torturing our relationship to death. My current husband did the same thing with his cheating ex wife. Both of us would have dumped them the instant we found out they were cheating if we could do it all over again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want you to know that I do not know anything about your culture so you are getting the perspective of an average American girl. 

"I agreed and told myself eventually she will change." 

This is where you went wrong. ^

The point of a relationship is to find someone who matches you, not to find someone you like and then change them so that they match you. Even if she decides to "let you change her" she will resent you for forcing her to be someone she is not. 

It seems like you guys are on a completely different page. You mention you drank sparkling juice on the roof so I get the impression that you don't drink alcohol and she does. You don't smoke weed and she does. 

Although I think she did act selfishly, leaving you double parked and all, she might feel like you are selfish too because you are expecting her to act like someone she is not and try to change her. 

She hangs out with those friends because those are the people she is comfortable with and wants to be around. She might not be exactly like them but people tend to hang around others who are like them. 

You had a crush on her for a long time and she is beautiful, so you might be seeing her as what you want her to be rather than who she really is. Try and open your eyes. Is she acting and treating you really how you want someone you are dating act and treat you? You don't sound happy and it has only been three dates. Usually people don't fight that early that are compatible. You two Might be wrong for each other. Maybe not, I don't know, but it honestly does not look good. 

See her for who she really is and not who you want her to be and then decide if that is someone you can love. Just the way she is. Sounds to me though that you guys are completely different people and it is not fair to try and change her. Take her for who she is or don't date her. If she hands or with people you think are druggie idiots, she might be a druggie idiot. (I'm not calling her an idiot or a druggie but she sounds like she acts just like her friends that you hate.)

I realize you guys already broke up but even if you had not, it seems like it was doomed to fail. Try and cheer yourself up by knowing it most likely ever would have worked.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand where you are coming from. I think it's hard to tell when comedians (and many other entertainers) are being serious/real and when they are telling a story.

It reminds me of when Eminem was sued because people thought he was doing all the things he rapped about. Maybe he did do some of it, maybe he didn't. It's hard to tell when people who tell stories for entertainment or shock value are being genuine or not. I don't think being a shock value comedian who talks about this stuff necessarily excludes her from being a feminist but that's just my two cents. 

In my opinion, as controversial and vulgar as she is, she's walking in entertainer territory previously off limits to women (not that she's the first to do it by any stretch but she's still an anomaly). To me that makes her some kind of a trail blazer. Not all feminists are feminists in the same way or in a way we might agree with. Just my opinion. I see where you are coming from.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm merely noting the disparity between people all out hating her for shit like this and then not giving two fucks when a man does it. And men are not "doing it in the past" there are male comedians who are making jokes like this right fucking now that are getting none of the same level of "outrage". 

And yes, I think that if done properly in comedy, most things can be joked about. Comedy is a tool and a coping mechanism that brings a little relief about serious things in a dark world. It's a social commentary and a parody of itself at most times.  </TEXT>
