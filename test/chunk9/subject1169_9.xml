	<TEXT> Yes I do periodize my training, but right now I'm still following a simple linear progression because I have still a lot of newbie gains to seize. I have mentioned my current workout program in this post http://imgur.com/a/UpdzW. The only thing I do is ramp up the volume from week to week and increase the weights. Next mesocycle I will follow n-suns 531 mainly for strength purposes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know that a higher bf % probably would help my growing, but right now I don't know if the distress this will cause would be worth it. I am just going to continue my lean bulk. Yes I have gyno, but thankfully it is slowly decreasing so I don't worry about it all ;) thanks dude! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your kind response. I did not know at all to me what was happening when I was 13, 14, or even 15. I still can't really understand how it all happened. I don't believe it was my own fault, but I do feel sad sometimes about the pain it has caused to my parents. It's weird. It felt like I wasn't conscious at all, it was like I was dreaming. I think that the mental disorder and the underfeeding combined made me into a numb machine. 

I am really excited to start n-suns 531! You stay strong too man. Better yet, get even stronger! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could be, but tat is a one year transformation, from 2015 to 2016. I think if you compare the picture from 2015 to the pictures of my current physique you see a big difference. Maybe it's not much to you but I feel so much happier with my body than I felt back then.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You mean the after pictures from 2016 right? A lot of people have commented on it, but I did not photoshop it. I do realize it looks weird but the other pics don't.  </TEXT>
