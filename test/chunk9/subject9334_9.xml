	<TEXT> Lived in York during my time at university.  Trying to find something in the city walls is possible but it will also reflect in the price. Look at the areas outside of the walls, Acomb, Heworth, Clifton etc. All these areas have links to bus routes that can get you into town. 

York is a very bicycle friendly town so I suggest looking into getting a bike, very useful!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LPT. If you want a tattoo, think about it for a month. It's something that stays on your skin for life, (unless you remove the limb). Don't be an idiot and get something you regret.
