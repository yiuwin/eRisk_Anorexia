Wat. Marx was from a wealthy family, as were many other communist leaders. It's almost exclusively the petit-bourgeoisie who are socialist these days, too, not the poor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Politicians care too much about national prestige and waving our dick around. It's absurd, imo, to seriously hurt the Russian people this way because they annexed a bit of land whose people seem to support them. It's really no business of ours and just antagonizes Russia, who we should be seeking cooperation with.

Tillerson seems like a typical neocon to me. Diplomacy should be the first resort, not sanctions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This spat over Crimea is one of the most meaningless dick-measuring competititons I've ever seen. 

Firstly, the sanctions are totally ineffective. All they do is hurt the Russian people, who are innocent of the actions of their government. In a democracy sanctions can create pressure on the government to change, but what are the Russians going to do? Vote out Putin? Nonsense.

Secondly, Crimea is largely Russian and Russia has some legitimate claims there. 

I think a better course of action would be to organize a second referendum, with international observers, and have both sides agree to respect its results.

This is helping *nobody*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  the corporatists are trying to gain "legitimacy" points by paying ideological lip service to NARAL and identity politics, instead of being true to their actual ideals of being pro-labor

This has been true since at least 1968, when Bobby Kennedy vs Hubert Humphrey vs Gene McCarthy laid the fault-lines of the modern Democratic party: identity politics vs unions vs libertines.

It hasn't always been this clear, but it's always been the struggle in the Democratic Party. </TEXT>

The purpose of the state is to defend people from other people (i.e. from interpersonal and large-scale violence) and to ensure that contracts are enforced (for example, if someone refuses to fulfill their obligation to pay for food they purchased, they are punished).

It does not exist to punish ideological enemies, you fucking lunatic.
