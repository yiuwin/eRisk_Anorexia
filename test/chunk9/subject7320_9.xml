	<TEXT> I support Hillary, but I think it would be a bit naive to say that shilling isn't going on.  I personally feel that's basically what reddit is.  Just vote bots and counter vote bots.  If you look at the donald it's the same bullshit.  I would love to see data on the regular contributors.

	<TEXT> Anyone casually paying attention to the news has at least heard the word "Aleppo".  Not saying you have to know the name of the rebels 3rd from the top commander's middle name, but Aleppo is probably something you want to have saved in your wheelhouse.  It just shows a complete disconnect from current events.

	<TEXT> I think it would still come out to a car being worth it, because you'd need to factor in time you are losing going to and from the rental place.  In anything, time is always the most valuable, even if you are doing nothing because doing nothing can be more beneficial than constantly going back to a car dealership.  I think my ultimate point is it would be way to difficult for one person to figure this out.  And can definitely not be dumbed down to an arithmetic equation.  Would need to generate a lot of random data and figure out the constraints for each data point.  Looks interesting, but I doubt anyone cares enough to figure out what likely has an obvious answer.   </TEXT>

The main problem is people thinking we are talking about a ts classification.  Sure it was stupid but it's run of the mill stupid and my time is the dos showed that this is frustratingly common.   This situation does not exist in vacuum.   Calling for one persons head is a bit a stretch, but the idiots pushing this garbage know that people will react in a typical manner.

	<TEXT> I had neighbors that had two kids that no one could tell me who the fuck the parents were.  The kids were nice, one was 6 and the other 10.  Everyone night you could smell pot and cigarette smoke coming out the windows and there was loud aggressive rap music constantly playing.  There was a revolving group of around 12 tenants (none actually payed rent) and most were drug dealers and a couple were trannie prostitutes.  Fights were regular and so was domestic violence.  Child services seemed to not really give and shit and the police were useless.  I eventually got them by bugging the wards councilman and going through housing court.  

All I could think about was how fucked up it was that these kids will change from nice kids to shitty kids by the time they are 12 or 14.  When I lived in Louisiana, I would see the same thing happen to white kids in the trailor parks or deep rural areas.  The major difference there was steroids. </TEXT>

A potion of the BLM movement in my area is unfortunately easily susceptible to race-baiting (not unlike every single person commenting in this thread), but there are also people that are active in the community.  Community development leaders, block club organizers, and guess what *gasp* most of them are white.  

I do personally think BLM is a shit show and unorganized, but I separate myself from this casual hivemind bullshit where you can see a video and then there are 200 arm chair philosophers who start talking out of their ass.  Not everyone in here is racist or even wrong, but if I were to say everyone in here commenting were a scourge on reddit, that would be the same as what nearly everyone commenting is doing.  And make no mistake, when most of you guys say BLM, you mean black people.  Don't fucking kid yourself.  </TEXT>

RP is non-existant but sometimes done sarcastically
There's no one that would probably take any sort of payment

Basically you level to 90 (which is pretty quick) and you multiclass and get your spread ready for the labyrinth which is 13 gates you get through and you are cut off from the world (It is uniquely challenging but all agree it is coded wonderfully and most miss being in it when they get out because of the unique gear).  When you finish you transform into one of the 4 ancient races (each AR has for subclasses that are uniquely powerful) and then you level up 180 to make it Hero, that's when you can start taking on the harder content or fight for control in one of the three war zones.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Age of Chaos aoc.pandapub.com port 4000.  Heavily modded circle mud.  Been around since 96 I believe?  There are four monk classes actually: spring, autumn, summer, and winter.  Two major differences among the 4 monk classes which are which tattoos they can get and what spells/skills they get.
Notable skills, but not a complete list by any means:
Spring: Access to the haste tattoo, gets the absorb spell (can absorb incoming spells and sometimes regens mana from them), harmony (a druid heal that is arguebly one of the best heals in the game)
Summer: Almost all tattoos are extremely heavy on damage, access to the reflection spell (like absorb but has a chance to reflect the spell back at the caster), wall of fire (extremely annoying pvp spell)
Autumn: I think these tattoos suck but luckily they are optional, there is one that gives an extra 1/2 attack, gets the clone spell (awesome spell, basically you get a clone of yourself to group with which is very useful), get the reflection and slow spell and also mimic which allows you mimic spell that someone else can cast if they are in the room.  Arguebly gets the best spells
Winter: I've never played winter so I can't comment on the usefulness of their tattoos, the body one looks kind of overpowered (-60 armor class, +4 hitroll, endure element), gets ward which is basically a timeout and no one can do anything about it.  I think only assholes play winter.

As with all classes they get access to two ancient knowledges through questing.  Whirlwind kick (the only non magical AoE in the game and you can use it while blind which is hilarious when you win a pvp match with it).  Fists of fury:  this is actually brand new and replaced the old one that no one used so I have no idea what it does.  I think it's just a giant buff to damage, hitroll, mana, and there a chance on hit to do some extra damage thingy.

The mud is in a lull as it always is in the summer and when fall kicks off people will trickle in.  Really you will find that you need no one in the game once you get going.  I've been playing off and on for 20 years and there are still zones I don't know. </TEXT>

So meltdown is a bit misleading but that's what everyone called it.  For quite awhile he was just straight up denying it, quoting irrelevant numbers.  He did raise his voice a couple times, I'm not sure if it's in this video.  For context of how awesome this:  1.  Rove was sure they had bought an election. 2. Virtually ever outlet had called the election already before his irrational rationalizations.  It's rare you get get to watch an epiphany as it happens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't like this particular show but I was listening to it today and I thought it was one of the more fair ones.  They were very fair to 3rd parties and you Guys are quoting out of context.  Not only that but you guys have latched on to a candidate that has never succeeded at anything and are surprised when people are critical of the Green Party.  

What i was hoping they would have said is that 3rd party would have a chance if their platform wasn't so alien.  Who the fuck puts anti vaccination on their platform? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Snowden, yes.  I don't care for Assange.  He's never done anything without plastering his name everywhere and adding a bit of drama and fanfare.  He does this to be famous.  Also it's pretty clear he is not neutral at all.  Releasing the info at this time, instead of literally any other time, was a political move and a risky one for him.  He stands to lose credibility when the dust settles.  

He is not some hero, just middleman for someone else's political maneuverings and he is sacrficing the credibility of an association the world needs in general. </TEXT>

Sure there are some who purchase homes the couldn't possibly afford but that is a personal choice.

I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish in this conversation.  It was your responsibility as a staff nco to make sure your subordinates were taking advantage of everything owed to them.  Which was a considerable amount.  Breaks my heart every time a young marine got out and pissed away his her time. </TEXT>
