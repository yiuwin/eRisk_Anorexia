	<TEXT> She publicly posted it on her blog before she was on TV in front of millions of people. If you went and started a blog, you wouldn't be expecting to have more than like ten people ever see it, and especially when the topic is this sensitive, it's just disrespectful to go hunting for something like this. It's like when people posted that article Zeke had about being transgender. Is it wrong? No. Is it creepy and invasive? Yes, absolutely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was kinda a bad move to tell Tai the plan like that so easily, it's like no one is even considering that there might be an idol (much less 3) in play. That being said, Aubry is clearly in the majority now only without the target that players like Cirie or Andrea have. Is that a good or bad thing? We'll find out I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the final 6, Andrea and Cirie have been voted out. Troyzan has immunity. Aubry, Tai, and Michaela planned to vote for Brad, while Brad, Troyzan, and Sarah were torn between voting Michaela and Aubry. Sarah steals the vote of Aubry. Everyone votes. 

Jeff returns with the urn. Tai stands up and says, "Jeff..." Aubry gives him puppy dog eyes and says, "I think it's split between me and you. Play it for whoever your gut tells you to." Tai walks up to Jeff, hands him the idol, and says, "this for Michaela." He returns to his seat. Sarah says, "Jeff, I have the legacy advantage, which gives me immunity at the final 6." 

Everyone looks around disoriented. Debbie claps on the jury, while Hali looks off in the distance, wishing she were making art out of cyclone remains. Jeff says, "anyone else?" Tai hesitates. the camera sits on his face glancing around nervously for an uncomfortably long period of time while the music swells. Finally, he says, "Jeff." Jeff gives a shocked look to the camera. Sarah holds her breath. Tai approaches Jeff. Aubry says, "Please Tai." Tai looks back and says, "They not vote for you. That what my gut say." Tai hands Jeff the idol and says, "This one for me." then returns to his seat. 

Jeff says, "Wow! So to recap, no votes for Tai, Michaela, or Sarah will count. I'll read the vote--" 

Before he can finish, Troyzan bounces up, saying, "Actually Jeff, I've got a trick up my sleeve too." He reaches in his bag for the idol, but can't find it, before realizing that he stuffed it in his underwear. He pulls it out and the camera shows Zeke with an enlightened facial expression, realizing that was why he always had such a big bulge. Troyzan hands the idol to Jeff, saying, "This one's for Brad," 

Jeff, just dumbfounded at this point, sarcastically asks, "Anyone else?" Jeff says, "I'll read the votes." Everyone tenses up in anticipation of whose idol was played correctly.

"First vote: Brad. Does not count."

Everyone deflates, Ozzy rolls his eyes on the jury.

"Brad. Does not count.

"Brad. Does not count.

Brad mouths, "Thank you Monica!" Tai rubs his arm nervously.

As Jeff reads the third vote, Tai, and Aubry sit on the edge of their seats. Michaela files her nails with a stick.

"Michaela."

Half the jury's jaw drops, while the other half sit looking disappointed. Aubry gasps, then smirks. Tai looks to her, then to Michaela, then to Brad in surprise. Michaela says, "Bye felicia."

"Michaela.

"Sixth and final vote...Michaela. We have a tie."

Tai looks around confused, then realizes what Jeff meant. Cut to commercial.

The show returns from commercial as the camera shows a wide shot of the tribal council set.

"We have a tie." Jeff reiterates. "As per the new rules, we will not revote. Normally, everyone would get a chance to come to a unanimous decision, but both people who got votes are immune, so instead we'll go straight to rocks."

Everyone looks at Aubry and Aubry looks around confused. "I'm the only one that can draw a rock though?" she says. Jeff looks at his flow chart, then back at Aubry. With a shrug he says, "Well, I guess that makes Aubry the 15th person eliminated and the 8th member of our jury. Aubry, bring me your torch."

Sierra looks around confused, while a fly lands on Ozzy. He doesn't notice. Aubry has her torch snuffed, and exits, while Jeff addresses the remaining contestants one final time: "Now that was a game-changing Tribal Council. Who knows where things will head from here, grab your torches and head back to camp, good night." </TEXT>

It's funny, I used to say the stuff you're saying, when I first started college. I'd be like, "the point of college isn't learning, it's to get a degree! I can learn anything I want to on the internet."

Well, now I graduate in two days and what I've realized is that it isn't nearly as easy to learn about a topic thoroughly on the internet. The purpose of college is to learn from professionals whose job it is to teach. Yes, you can learn from other places, but not as thoroughly or with not as much quality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're thinking about the issue too simplistically. Yes, most employers have started requiring a bachelor's degree and a college education is expected of students; but the reason employers require one in the first place is because it's an easy way to tell if someone has the skills and knowledge necessary for the job. It's not like employers just require a degree for the sake of having a degree, but rather a degree to them is an easy way to filter out who has learned and who hasn't. Yet, because of this, a lot of students, as evidenced by all the nasty replies I'm getting, have lost sight of the importance of a college degree and *only* get it because employers want it, therefore missing the point why employers wanted it in the first place and not getting the full value out of their degree. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree completely. I don't think I'll ever stop watching survivor, but it is starting to lose its magic the more it focuses on strategy. Strategy gets repetitive, strategy becomes predictable, strategy loses its luster after watching enough big moves, but interpersonal drama, what this show was founded on, and what made seasons like KR so good, will never get old. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're missing the point of empathy though. Empathy is feeling what the other person is feeling regardless if you've had that experience. For example, if someone's parent dies of cancer, you can still empathize with them even if your parents are healthy, by drawing upon similar experiences, such as the time your mom got pneumonia and you thought she was going to die or the time your elementary school teacher died from a stroke. Empathy isn't about having the same exact experience, it's about being able to feel what other people feel, and with some imagination that is always possible. </TEXT>
