	<TEXT> The only NASA Venus lander to make it to the surface was not actually designed to land, [it was an atmospheric probe that somehow managed to survive its passage through the Venusian atmosphere and land on the surface intact where it operated for about 45 minutes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Venus_Multiprobe) NASA has had a [back-burner project for years working on designing a long duration Venus rover.](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050192311.pdf). It [recently had success in designing integrated circuts that can last over 1000 hours of operation in a venus like atmospheric condition at temperatures akin to those on venus.](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-glenn-demonstrates-electronics-for-longer-venus-surface-missions) While Russia had a handful of landers operate succesfully at the surface, no nation has ever had a Venus rover do so before and i imagine that getting funding for such a rover is the ultimate goal of the pro-Venus cadre of NASA scientists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Given that the ISRO has consistantly delayed testing on their manned spacecraft, the [ISRO Orbital Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISRO_Orbital_Vehicle), and that the GSLV Mark III that they plan to use as a launch vehicle for it has yet to fly an orbital flight, I seriously doubt that we shall see an Indian space station any time soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NASA hasn't released much info about  the proposals submitted, but has said that among them are a Titan lander (  [hopefully its the submarine proposal for exploring Titan's seas!](https://youtu.be/Ruiq9GAEZEc)  ), a mission to sample the water plumes of Saturn's moon Enceladus, and a Saturn atmospheric probe are among the proposals submitted. There has been much speculation that NASA will choose a Venus lander or orbiter since various Venus mission proposals have been sidelined in the past rounds of mission selection for various NASA programs. Also a Trojan asteroid tour was originally put on high priority for New Frontiers 4, but that seems unlikely now that a Trojan tour mission has already been selected as part of the Discovery program. My money is on the Enceladus plume sample mission though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah well, i hoped for the best lol. It looks like they are following the AoT path then, if this light novel is successful, expect a whole slew of them (and perhaps some spinoff manga as well). From the links you provided, it looks like Miura at least did the illustrations for the book, so maybe there will be something of value in that. I do remember one of you giving some hopeful thoughts to the illustrations as well in the podcast too lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hadn't seen that Natalie.Mu piece mentioned anywhere before, but i would say that your criticism is more valid because of the ambiguity surrounding Miura's role in its creation then. 
I would be supportive of a novel (co-written by Miura) about Gaiseric, so long as it didn't reveal his interaction with the godhand or how (i assume) he became the SkullKnight. A novel, for example, focused on his early days of conquering would not really touch all that much i assume on the main story that Berserk follows and his role within the story. It would seem to me that Miura's publisher wants Berserk to try to have the same market breadth that Attack on Titan has. Attack on Titan has had considerable financial success with spin-off works like light novels and side-story mangas. These secondary AoT works are not written (or co-written) by the creator of AoT. If thats the model that Berserk is following, i'm signifigantly less enthused about this Berserk light novel or any others. However, i still would be more than enthused if it were actually co-authored by Miura.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Miura is listed as a co-author, generally creators of series like Berserk do not list themselves as co-authors of  works if they are not heavily involved with the creation of such works. I imagine that Miura  was literally a co-author of the book if he was willing to list himself as such on its cover. </TEXT>
