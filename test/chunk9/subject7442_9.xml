	<TEXT> Been a long time lurker but thinking about getting a serious pair of raw demin. I currently have a pair of Gap Japanese Selvedge Raw demin and I think they're a good starter but I am considering upgrading. I was thinking about a pair of APC petite new standards? Would those even be a good beginner pair? Any comments about those would be greatly appreciated. I'm a true size 30 so should I size down one? </TEXT>
