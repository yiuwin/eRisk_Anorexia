	<TEXT> I had a friend in high school that was a genius.  He had an almost perfect score on both the SAT and ACT.  He was also a 4.0 student, volunteered for multiple charities, and participated in multiple extra-curricular activities.  He applied for Stanford, and was rejected.

Two other people from the same class applied to Stanford. They had decent grades and a little above average SAT and ACT scores.  They both applied to Stanford, and were personally flown from Alaska and given a personal tour.

Difference between the two examples?  First guy was white and the other two people were Alaskan Native.

	<TEXT> I was arrested but not charged a few years ago.  Long story short I had ripped a door off its hinges and cracked a door frame. When the two female officers arrived I was calm and collected and willingly let them arrest me.  As I put my arms behind my back I flexed my arms because it was uncomfortable.  When I made that motion both officers tensed noticeably.  I was confused and then realized, unless they used their guns their was absolutely no way the two of them could detain me if I struggled.  

I understand why you want mixed gender police forces, but you have to make sure you keep high physical standards and maybe consider sending at least one of each gender on calls with potentially violent men. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had it both ways.  Agile development with a good scrum master can produce a great product.  But it has to be structured and have realistic deadlines.

I've also had managers that said, "We had the deadline moved up a month so now we are going to use Agile development to go faster."

No, no, that's not how any of this works. </TEXT>
