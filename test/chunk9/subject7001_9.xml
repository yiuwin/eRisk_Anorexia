	<TEXT> I bought a 3ds from a friend and I just completed the 3ds.guide with it. It is still logged in to his Nintendo network ID and I want to link my own Nintendo network id. When I go to format system memory it says it will delete all downloaded software and save data. If I do this will I loose what I just set up with the guide? </TEXT>
