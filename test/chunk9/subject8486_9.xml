"The complaint that it is difficult to do business due to widespread local corruption is more a smokescreen, I would argue, to justify questionable business practices, such as extravagant gifts and hiring relatives of senior government officials, than a reasonable criticism of the FCPA. 

If you claim everyone else is doing it, and therefore you had to go along, that makes it easier to justify engaging in conduct that has crossed the line into the unethical, and perhaps even illegal." </TEXT>

A professor of education psychology looks at the French approach to food and pleasure. "The education of taste means teaching children to appreciate and savor the wide variety of flavors in the world and to eat properly at the table. In my eight months conducting research on French parenting in Paris, I found that the education of taste begins very early in families and is reinforced in daycare centers, where even two-year-olds are served formal, yet relaxed, four-course lunches with an appetizer, main course, cheese plate and dessert." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would also look at Natick and Needham - two more western suburbs that are primarily single family homes but have some apartments.  Think along Rt. 9.

Note that there really are PLENTY of young professionals in Boston, and you fit that demographic.  You don't fit the demographic of r/boston, which really does skew to collage, post-college, and urban.

One of the stereotypical patterns of Boston is that when people have kids, they move from these urban areas into the suburbs which have much better schools - but have much more expensive home prices.  So many rentals in the suburbs are 3BRs that are geared towards families that want the schools.  1BRs are rarer but less in demand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 'Grizzly bear researcher and PhD candidate Sarah Elmeligi, working out of Banff National Park, says she has witnessed all kinds of unexpected social behavior among grizzliesincluding play dates. In one case, she observed two females, each with three cubs, together in a grassy open area by the mouth of creek. Its not like the moms are sitting back and drinking tea and watching their kids on the monkey bars, she says, but they did hang out on multiple occasions. In part, it likely provided safety from males who can kill cubs during mating season, but, Elmeligi says, It really demonstrates that grizzly bears are so much more social than we give them credit for and that there are occasions where theyre not just simply tolerating each other because theres a lot of food around, but there are actually occasions where they are spending time together.'

First, to protect slavery by giving each state the power to regulate the domestic institutions within its borders. This was an enticing carrot for the slave states: stay in the Union and you can keep slavery. Second, to dispossess Congress of the power to abolish or interfere with slavery. And third, to make itself unamendable by providing that no amendment shall be made to the Constitution that would undo the Corwin Amendment.... In his first inaugural address Lincoln declared that he had no objection to the Corwin Amendment, nor that it be made forever unamendable.' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Blocked javascript/css is not about blocking the files from loading, but about those files putting up roadblocks to the page rendering.  When a javascript or css file is loaded in the header, the browser waits for that file before going on to other things, slowing down the page.  You want to avoid that.  Here are some tips from Google on how to deal with the issue: https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/BlockingJS

	<TEXT> It's straight-out terrible when it feels like you're exploiting Veterans to make money: "Commemorating the 61st anniversary of D-Day. Have you tried our D-licious burgers?"

A simple image with an innocous message about honoring the Greatest Generation or bravery will probably do well in soliciting likes.  If you have a father or grandfather who you could honor (thus bringing your own personality into it), it would probably do really well.

Offering a special discount to Veterans might work, but be careful that it comes across as you doing something special for them and not you taking advantage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Pharisees and Sadducees weren't heretics - they were different strains of practice and emphasis within Judaism.  The Essenes were a heretical sect who went off to live by the Dead Sea.

The Jews handled heresy without a pope much the same way as they do now: leaders would condemn it and preach against it and try excommunicating the followers. But Judaism was much less codified then than it is now.  Read the prophets for numerous accounts of the people deviating from the received truth and being chastised for it. There is no evidence of them handing over heretics to the civil authorities (outside of the Gospels). </TEXT>
