	<TEXT> Wtf! Called the police? Nope! I would have gotten out of the car opened the door and thrown her on her ass as soon as she told me she wasn't getting out. That is his car and he can say if you can or can't ride. What an entitled cunt. Another example of a millennial who thinks the world owes them something and they are special.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny you said that. After Dr. King was killed the black communities started rioting across the nation. Which I never really understood. MLK preached change through peace and protest that didn't end in violence. Strange how they just turned on his teachings and went the violent route after his death. Anyways I digress. Didn't president Carter make black history month to help quell the riots? I am really asking out of curiosity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. I work for the government and never see those ethnic groups celebrated, but when February rolls around I see a table set up for people to come by and learn some shit you can learn in school. People dress in what they think is native wear,  and have luncheons to celebrate. I don't see that ever happen for any other ethnic group.  </TEXT>
