	<TEXT> A cool idea! I do have some tips that I think would help you obtain the look you are trying to achieve. Since fairies are not real, I am going off the image that comes to mind when I think of a fairy.

First off, the things I like. The nose highlight! it really makes it look dainty and gives a nice glow. Your freckles are gorgeous and fit the fairy them, so I'd say don't try to cover them up.  

The lipstick is too frosted and gets lost in with the rest of your skin. I think a nude or light pink gloss would add a bit of color without taking attention away from your eyes.

The brows are also a little too bold for a fairy's. Fairies are wispy, airy; they flutter around and are weightless. Using less brow product and letting some individual hairs show will help. That doesn't mean don't do them at all, just go for a more natural look.

The eyeshadow is cool, but the yellow should be kept on your lid or lid to crease only as to minimize visual clutter. It will have more impact that way.  The eyeliner wing also is very dramatic, thick, and angled. This is really good for some looks, but doesn't really fit in with this one.

I hope this helps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I put on white instead of nude eyeliner on my waterline.  I just haven't gotten around to buying any more, and white looks cool-not natural, but it does make your eyes look bigger. Since I don't wear natural makeup anyways I don't care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are super pretty, I ADORE the freckles! I would make the brows more feathery (brush out the powder/gel just a bit), and add some more depth by darkening the crease shades (though that is my personal style, i don't go as natural as you lol).

My biggest CC would to add a light color on the waterline, would reslly pull the look together </TEXT>

 **Kat Von D High Voltage Primer**

**Marc Jacobs Gel Liner** in black as a base for the shadow

**Kat Von D's Shade and Light Eye Palette**. Used the chocolate brown for a transition shade, and a matte black to deepen the black. Some of the lightest shade under my brow

	<TEXT> finally, someone who doesn't snub undertow. i adore that album. 

1 2. Undertow and Lateralus (tied) It's like apples to oranges...IMMENSELY different, but I love both. undertow appeals to my love of grunge, Lateralus really transports you to a different place.

3. nima: Many of my favorite songs are on here, but I honestly am not a fan of the nihilistic theme, especially on the title song.

4. 10,000 Days: Great work as usual, but too many filler songs. Rosetta Stoned is a banger though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't buy much high-end makeup that I regret, but I do regret a lot of my NYX stuff. Some of it is great, so that's why I continue to buy the brand. Sadly, a lot absolutely sucks...

* **NYX Liquid Suede in Vintage:** Just way too purple-toned, much more than it appeared in the tube. Smudges a lot and the paddle-applicator sucks. I also can't get over the sticky texture and bad smell.

* **NYX felt tip liner:** Oh god, worst pigmentation and ran out day one I used it. Stick with anything else...I was really looking forward to an affordable one, too.

* **NYX Wonder Pencil:** Don't bother using this on your waterline if you want it to stay more than 10 minutes. It comes off easily, has an overly-firm texture, and doesn't blend well either.

* **NYX Tres Jolie Liner:** It is good quality gel liner itself, but the sharpener doesn't sharper. I honestly just broke the tip every time I tried to use it, no matter at what angle or pressure. Therefore, I either put the product onto another eyeliner tip or don't use it at all.
