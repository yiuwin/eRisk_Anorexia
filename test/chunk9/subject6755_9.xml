	<TEXT> Hi, I am using google docs as a sign up sheet but would like to have the document set up so it cannot be edited until a certain time. How would I go about setting this trigger? Thank you!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love how Leafy doesn't acknowledge any of Ethan's points and proceeds to only attack him. It's obvious he's flustered about Ethan's logical arguments and cannot defend his own process.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Fastest way to record and upload videos to file sharing site, such as Box </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I am a private violin teacher who has recorded lessons with students and burned them onto CDs in the past, but would like to switch to digitizing lesson videos. What would be the fastest way to record and upload video to an online sharing site? Specifications are:
-Using a Mac
-Very fast internet speed (~70 mbs download, ~50 mbs upload)
-Videos would be around an hour long
-Would prefer if video transfer would take no more than 10 minutes (time between lessons)
-Good quality video (720p)

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The video has a lot of hilarious, unrelated Japanese:

0:05: Taking the first 5 letters of the Japanese alphabet, hiragana, and swapping them around.

0:39 (1): Moon

0:39 (2): Earth

0:39 (3): Space Ship

0:40 (1): Soccer

0:40 (2): Sun

0:40 (3): Cat

0:41 (1): Idiot (baka). It is written in hirgana, when it is commonly written in katakana.

0:41 (2): Dog

0:43 (1): Space Ship (poor). Bad Japanese usage, where the correct form is shown earlier in the video. This form uses the formal distinction for a seafaring ship, and not used for a "space" ship. 

0:43 (2)-0:44: /Japanese I don't know

0:45-0:46: /Translate with Google words </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is everyone hating on the singers? Interesting harmonies, and in the end only are there to add a lyrical element to the epic instrumentation. If anything, the simplicity and crispness of their singing are just right (except the very end). </TEXT>

Just watched this TED talk, which explains the whole process very well

	<TEXT> It's not even the fact that she moves so much that irritates me, but that moving so much will drastically change her bow's contact with the violin and thus will tremendously diminish her sound. It's as if she's trying to sound bad.   </TEXT>
