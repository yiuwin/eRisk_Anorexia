	<TEXT> The difference is that my Mum actually adhered to this, and it has helped me immensely in my life now.

If you know you've mucked up, my Mum has always maintained that she will help me whatever, and do her darndest to make the punishment as low as possible. Now living in boarding college environment, it has been exactly the same with the pastoral management, especially our Deputy Headmaster Pastoral, who happens to be ex military, a former welfare officer at the rank of WO2. He maintains that he will also support us in any problem that we might have and do his damndest to make the punishment as low as possible because we owned up, but that we would never get off scot-free, because he said he doesn't believe in that. </TEXT>

I like it, but there is much in it that doesn't give what we really wanted. So yes, I'd like an Empire Total War 2.

What I would really like in a game is the diplomatic system of a decent EU4 play through, but with the combat system from a good Total War title. Might be too much to ask for though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think Rey will be a Skywalker. It will be a twist none of us will see coming, I'm sure.

That being said, I would love it if she was a Kenobi.

I also like the theory that Mace Windu survived Revenge of the Sith. It seems completely improbable, but I can dream. I feel like Samuel L Jackson would eventually convince them to get him back in the franchise.

Another I like is that the bearded dude in Return of the Jedi is Captain Rex, and somehow he managed to cure the fast aging caused by the fact that he's a clone and fought with the rebellion.

Most of the Snoke theories I don't like.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright! Edexcel history, I can help with this.

Figures - ballpark is generally fine. There are some you need to know fully, but in most cases you are fine with ballparking it.

Be good on your dates. Month and year is pretty much essential. Day helps too. For instance, off the top of my head, the Reichstag fire was on 27th February 1933. Total reparations: 6.6 billion.

Also, work on exam techniques and know exactly what the examiner is looking for. Be articulate in your writing if you want good SPAG marks. Its always great if you correctly use a word that the examiner is probably going to have to look up.

Things like that you need to know. I can PM you my discord ID if you want. I'm in year 12 and didn't drop a UMS in history last year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From browsing this sub recently I have got the impression that many people think that nick and Judy will become romantically involved at some point in the near (canon) future.

In my head, this doesn't seem like it would be a great place for the story to go. Throughout the film it seems evident that their relationship is built on trust and is purely a friendly relationship. I feel as if there would be biological 'things' ingrained in the different species that sort of stops any sort of sexual attraction. You can relate that to real life: interspecies friendships are not unheard of, but they are always purely friendships.

Have I got the right idea here, or is it just the wishful thinking of a minority? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I have heard, there is almost no need to have any formal power of attorney documents for medical reasons, just a signed declaration from the person giving away power of attorney and a signature from a doctor saying that he or she has mental capacity to make that decision. There isn't anywhere near as much red tape as the UK system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hence why I put life limiting in there. If it is something relatively minor that's really only an inconvenience, then fine. But if it is something that would warrant round the clock care and/or extended stays in hospital, then it is fundamentally unethical. My mother works in children's continuing care, and she often tells me of how the NHS has to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds to look after children who would be lucky to see their 16th birthday. In a time when budgets are being slashed left, right and center, there must be better places the money could be spent that would better benefit society as a whole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This kind of kid is one who has been allowed to get away with stuff.

Friday I had the pleasure of looking after my two nephews. Now, if it is just myself, my younger sister and my dad, they are as good as gold.

As soon as my brother in law (their Dad) is around, all hell breaks loose because he absolutely panders to their whims. You can't hit a kid for misbehaving and then expect them to not dish out the same crap to their peers. He doesn't know how to dish out a proper punishment and stick by his decision.
It pisses me off to no end because someone with that attitude should never have had a kid, let alone two. Kids need boundaries, there needs to be a line and they need to know when they've crossed it, and the punishment for crossing it needs to be enforced and not dropped out on 30 minutes after you give it too them.

Sorry about that, needed to blow off some steam. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can shed some light on what it's like to have to do this. The summer before last we adopted a rescue Springer spaniel. Immediately we began to see issues. The only time he seemed to be happy was when he was in a small confined space and when he was outside he was almost completely uncontrollable. To begin with, for the first few days, we thought that this was completely understandable, given that he's a new dog in a new environment. Until he went for another dog, as in on its back, going for the jugular. My dad hauled him off him, and that was it. He went back the same day, and it soon came to light that we had been misinformed about the dog's background. He'd been trained to run as a gun dog and be a working Springer, not as a family pet, so one could see that the fault was not ours.

I'd be interested to hear what you think. </TEXT>
