My Best Buy in Canada always have Steelbook even in the afternoon, loads of them for release dates.

I've graduated high school nearly the top of my class averaging so far over my four years what would calculate close to a 4.0 gpa on the 4 point scale (my schooling system does it on a 6 point scale). Ive almost never studied for a single exam and never have to because of my memory; answering the commonly asked question "how I stayed in challenger for 3-4 seasons and can maintain success in school".

**Madame Gao's** faction of the Hand purpose is to spread the Steel Serpent heroin that resembled the Shou-Lao, also perhaps to invade K'un Lun. 


**Bakuto's** faction of the Hand purpose is to infiltrate the corporations around the world at the highest level, to train soldiers and to capture the Iron Fist. 

Also to note that there seem to be 1 entity controlling all the Hand factions behind the scene as well. Madame Gao made a reference to that.  </TEXT>
