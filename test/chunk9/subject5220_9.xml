	<TEXT> On the plus side, we are both fortunate to not only have had disc world shared with us by Terry, he wrote a whole massive pile of disc world books too.

But whilst there's nothing like starting a book for the first time, rereading old books is like meeting up with old friends - always a pleasure.

	<TEXT> Glad it's been a help to you! the constant hiding can be stressful in itself

I'm fine with my scars around friends, but not work colleagues, or family (no-one in my family knows - at least that I know of). Fine in winter, but wearing long sleeves all through the summer when visiting gets a bit uncomfortable :-| No problem with them seeing tats though :-)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, that's good to know - thanks for sharing :-) Will be interesting to see what some of the local artists say. I can almost see why some scars might not tattoo well - they appear to have an almost shiny appearance from the scarring; I'm glad yours didn't have that problem. 

Next step is to find an artist!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, will certainly be going along to see some local artists. From what i've been reading (which is help for me), it can be beneficial to go along to them with a theme, rather than ask for an exact replica of a pic I have. Happy to be lead by them, and as you say they can design something to minimise the visibilty of scars. Ta :-)  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Scar covering - lots of scars, varied depth / mixing styles </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-10 00:28:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My forearms are [covered in scars](http://imgur.com/gallery/7uioF/new), most minor, few deeper ones, all 10+ years old now. I've been thinking about tattoos on my shoulders lately, but like the idea of sleeves and wandered what effect these scars may have - would they make fine detail unsuitable, and instead be best covered with blocky designs? 

A second question, when mulling over designs in my mind, I alternate between fantasy (celtic\mythological\nature), and futuristic (geometric, clean, angular lines); as I can't decide I'm thinking of focusing on one theme per arm. I know it's a very personal exression anyway, but just wanted to get feedback\thoughts from folks who have maybe done something similar - I'm kinda drawn to having one theme and sticking with it, and then I end up perpetually unable to decide one way or the other. 

BTW, I've seen a few questions on tattoos and scars when I searched, but many of these have the photos removed now (the posts being several years old), so thought I'd start a new Q, but feel free to link to a previous Q\A if useful. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

Not one of the scientific source supplied mention their product. This reeks of scam to me, in the same way as diet loss pills (which incidentally, often come with a get out clause of 'may help lose weight when used as part of an overall calorie controlled diet'

In short, as per other responses, look to more tried and trusted methods of weightloss.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is super helpful, thanks so much for taking the time to comprehensively answer my questions (including some I didn't realise I had!). 

I do have a spare licence of Office 2013, so will have a full version of OneNote to put on there. Good to know about that, and yes hopefully that issue will be fixed soon about which version of OneNote gets launched. 

Also I was tentatively considering the Surface 3 purely from a price point. Whilst the 10" isn't ideal, the drawing delay you mention would be a real problem, so really good to know about that. 

Sounds the solution you mention of using the native reader and the underlining\adding notes to PDFs would work well for me. I do have an Adobe Creative Cloud licence on my desktop. Not sure if it would allow me to have the full version of Acrobat DC installed on different computer to the rest of my apps, but not a show stopper. 

It does sound like you have very similar usage to what I'm expecting - enthused to hear how easy it is to use both PDFs\OneNote together so easily; I've had exactly the same issue with firing up the desktop PC, landscape monitors, mouse navigation, so can really see the advantage of the touchscreen\pen to help with this. 

I'm definitely getting one now, at any rate - thanks again for your extremely helpful writeup :-)  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pre-purchase (SP3 i5) questions </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-05 19:00:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I currently use an iPad 2, along with an i5 ultrabook, mainly for studying (notes taking assignment writing, interactive online classes), and had a couple of questions I'm hoping an SP3 owner could answer. 

* Using the drawing within OneNote do you have access to commands like snap, to draw joined straight lines easily, or is it mainly freehand drawing?
* Is it possible to add notes, or highlight text, in PDFs? I've seen one tutorial video where it seemed that the user was just screenshotting a PDF page, pasting into OneNote and then editing. I'd really like the digital equivalent of highlighting key points, or adding notes, to a printed textbook. As my study books are all available in PDF, I guess this would need to be done through Reader. Just wondered if anyone currently does this. 

Thanks in advance! 

Btw, my reasons for upgrading are that I rarely use my laptop currently as have a desktop at home, and so would sell my laptop to part fund an SP3. I'd also benefit from the larger (12" vs 10") screensize over my iPad for reading textbooks with.  </TEXT>
