	<TEXT> Here's the thing, no one here is going to tell you to do it, but many of us did not smoke before we started vaping.   
  
For me, I had no previous addictions, maybe caffeine if you would even count that. I would would occasionally go to hookah bars with friends.
  
  
I vape 0 nicotine juices, let me tell you some of my pros and cons, maybe it will help you decide. 
  

Pros:   
 Fun new hobby - making coils, making juices, sharing recipes, etc  
 I can actually delay hunger if  i chain vape  
 Any flavor, literally no calories  
 An odd effect I've noticed is that after a heavy gym session and i'm out of breath it helps me catch my breath again more quickly?  
 I have not noticed any negative respiratory difference so far in almost 2 years of vaping  
 Instantly clears my stuffy nose for a short bit
  
  
Cons:  
 High initial start up cost and devices tend to have a very short warranty!  
 Continuous spending on juice and coils, you have to learn to make your own stuff if you really want to save money    
 The above mentioned con takes some time away  
 Will damage the lungs, however, the amount of damage it actually does is still pending study. Some studies say it might not  hurt at  all while others might say that they can be worse than cigarettes if used incorrectly. The only thing we know for sure is that it is insanely low compared to actual cigarettes.  
 I think the actual addiction comes from wanting a shiny new mod, or the next fancy new atomizer, well for me anyway  
 I generally do not have addictive traits, I stopped vaping for about 4 weeks now and have 0 'need' to vape. I'm not quitting i'm just waiting for my juice to steep.  
 Batteries can be extremely dangerous  
 You can actually get headaches from juices that use tons of flavor additives, kind of like when you're stuck in a room where there is a ton of fragrance and you breathe it in for a long time.

	<TEXT> Well first world problems and third world problems are common things people talk about, but when I saw someone link 4th world problems somewhere I thought as any normal person would, 'what the heck is that?' 

I didn't get it but I soon realized that it did not stop at 4th world problems, but kept  increasing to 999 and beyond; each even more strange than the previous.

	<TEXT> It's tricky to do, but I use the rebuildable section of my zephyrus and cut the wick very short, so that the juice will have a wide opening to go through. 

However the disadvantage to this is I cannot take a hit longer than ~6 seconds because it will get too hot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends. E-liquid is made with 4 things; VG, PG, Nicotine, flavor.  You will tend to see bottles marked with a % ratio for VG and PG (for example 75/25). Starter kits like your aspire vape pen will tend to have trouble with e liquids that are HIGH in VG, because VG makes the e liquid thick. This will give your tank trouble because the thickness may cause a blockage and not reach the coil causing a burning or "Dry" hit. If you do use a high VG e liquid then you will have to wait a bit for it to re-saturate.    

  
I recommend getting e-liquid with a ratio of 65% VG or less.  </TEXT>

 Did the store push this device on you? Because if they did this is the kind of shit that /r/vaping and /r/electronic_cigarette would go nuts about and try to get that store shut down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's what I think would happen if stuck @ .15 assuming mech mod or broken regulated.
  
  
It fires until the cotton gets dry, then it starts burning cotton.  

Cotton Catches on fire.   

If you don't catch it there from the smell or burning yourself, hopefully your coil stays intact and doesn't fall apart from the heat and discharges constantly until the battery dies permanently.  Probably won't vent.  

If the coil does not stay intact and falls apart inside the atty there's no telling what could happen. It could go really bad or nothing could happen. It's possible that your coil raises in ohms causing the battery to discharge slower @ less amps.  

Or if it turns out bad, you get a short, battery vents, your bag goes up in flames, probably won't "blow up" unless your mod's vent holes suck or the bag really traps those vented gasses together really well.
