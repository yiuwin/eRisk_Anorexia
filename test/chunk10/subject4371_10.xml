	<TEXT> Thanks. I went to school at Pratt Institute, but I wouldn't say I learned to paint in this manner from my time there. This specific painting came from following a method I found on the blog of [Douglas Flynt](http://douglasflynt.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2010-06-13T14:12:00-07:00 max-results=7 start=17 by-date=false) . Although I can't find the specific entry he talks about it, here is my post on the process of it: [my old blog](http://aritargownik.blogspot.com/2011/12/still-life-made-using-form-modeling.html) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This did occur to me, and I agree with you. Still, my knee jerk reaction with regards to reading the card title, then looking at the image, was that the Alpha version summed it up best/cleanest. This seems to be the trend for the older art vs the newer art in general - such as in the example of Fling.  </TEXT>

My first reaction was, "man, that's messed up" (what is happening to the drowned guy), then I saw Gideon and his reaction. Basically, it tells a story well and the colors are nice too. I didn't think about any of the stuff you mentioned, that's just me though.  </TEXT>
