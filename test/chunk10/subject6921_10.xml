	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Im asking because I'm in my early twenty's and I'm completely absorbed to the news for the last 1-2 years. From Trump to Iran, Russia, China, NK, etc. everything seems a little out of control and more dangerous then when i was a kid. So my question is, has it always been this out of control and I'm just started to really pay attention or is real crazy stuff happening? Like the threat of another major war seems around the corner. This question is really for those who are older then me and those that are history buffs. I hope this post fits the subreddit.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> should i buy this high mileage Civic </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This guy will sell a 4 door 2008 Honda Civic LX for $2500, buut it has 216k miles on it. Other then that its in great condition.He claims to have every maintenance record and seems like a guy who takes care of his car. He said he has done all scheduled maintenance. it has new tires, brakes, and a tune up. Im concerned about the mileage though, I don't want a car thats going to have some very expensive problems soon. I know the guy threw a friend and trust him and I know it has so many miles is because of his work. Should i pass or check it out?
edit: my budget is 3k

	<TITLE> My macbook pro 2012 vs newer laptops </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-03 16:28:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> so I bought my Macbook pro 2012 from Apple refurbished with 8gb ssd i7. I remember i spent about $1,300  for it in 2013 and It stills runs great. I'm looking at the the new Microsoft surface laptop thinking, why is it so expensive? Why 5 years later are the same specs about the same price? Im not currently in need of a replacement until my computer can no longer keep up. If i did want a new laptop i'd consider going PC because I'm not a huge fan of the direction Apple is going with their Macbook pros. I know i bought refurbished so it was cheaper, but the cost of laptops for the specs doesn't seem to have changed to much in the last 5 years? Am I assuming wrong? what other alternative are their for something that would match or out-perform my laptop? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Money advice for a broke college student </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-25 02:58:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So i moved out of my parents house months ago. moved from Florida to Texas and I've been living with my sister. Im already applied to a community college to finish my associates and there are a lot of good universities around if I finish here(DFW). So Im working a minimum wage job barely making ends meet then my car breaks down and the engine is toast. already put $600 for a new radiator and its a not even worth that much if I sold the car. Now my sister is talking of moving back home for health reasons. I have a friend in the area(DFW) that is looking for a roommate if she leaves, but now that I'm without a car I don't know what to do. I can't really afford to buy a car even if i do payments unless I get a second job and I'm already working full time. Then how am I supposed to make time for college? Im really want to stay, but if i go home to my parents Im free to do full-time school and make monthly car payments.  Im 24 and really just want to be out of the house. Anyone have any advice? thank you. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Had an accident last week (my fault) that busted my left front lights. Didn't think much of it since everything else looked fine, so I was just going to order new lights and replace them. Turns out on my way home from work When I slowed down to pull into my apartment complex i saw smoke coming from my hood. Took it to the shop the next day and they told me I needed a new radiator. I don't know how long the car was overheated because my temperature gauge isn't accurate(and hardly works). I decided to replace the radiator hoping the engine was fine. Picked it up and drove it home and everything was fine. But yesterday i started it and the whole car was shaking/vibrating pretty hard then it started to smoke out of the exhaust. Turned it on today and the same thing. It looks mostly white. first question: is it safe to drive to the mechanic? 2nd question: is this most likely going to be and expensive fix? The car isn't even worth $500 and Im not willing to spend 500 to thousands of dollars to repair it. I just spent about $600 hoping it would fix it. Btw If its not obvious I don't really know much about cars.  thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> E-Bike conversion kit. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-23 16:28:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm down a car and need to start commuting via my bike(I'm a broke college student). distance isn't that far (5 miles), but it can get up to 110 degrees in the summer and 30 degrees in the winter. Instead of spending 1k+ id rather just get a conversion kit. Im not so savy tho, so i'd like it to be something easier to put together. Does anyone know any good conversion kits for $500 or less? </TEXT>
