	<TITLE> WW2 Newspaper Headlines </TITLE>

	<TEXT> While cleaning out my aunt's garage, I stumbled upon these old WW2 papers that were tucked away in the corner. 


There are some major days in history recorded on these papers and I  thought the people here might like to see them. 


Most of the papers are dated towards the end of the war, and include the news of Hitler's death (though they weren't entirely sure if it was true or under what circumstances), FDR's passing away, the end of WW2, the Battle of the Bulge, the invasion of Berlin, Himmler's capture   suicide, and more. 

Feel free to take a look! Hope you enjoy this as much as I do!

	<TEXT> I am fine with this. The Church  Boy Scouts of America. They don't do scouting in much of the world. 

If people want to be a part of scouts, they can register with a local troop. Nobody is saying that they can't participate in scouting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am sorry you are so angry about a legitimate question I have. It just seems strange that it isn't talked about more considering how clearly it is discussed in the scriptures.

	<TITLE> The Word of Wisdom   Meat </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-15 06:23:50 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I was reading through the word of wisdom last night and had a question pop into my mind. 

When it comes to the Word of Wisdom, we usually talk about alcohol, drugs, coffee, and tea, but there seems to be a section that we often skip over (and I am not sure why). 

The section says:

10 And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man--
11 Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving.
12 Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly;
13 And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine. 

I wonder why we don't tend to follow these words as closely as we follow the rest of the Word of Wisdom. 

To me it sounds like meat is supposed to be used sparingly, and then sparingly is defined as times of winter, cold, and famine. 

As I haven't ever lived in a time of famine, it seems that I am breaking the Word of Wisdom and by all accounts eat too much meat. 

I am wondering how you have incorporated this into your lives and also ask why this isn't discussed more in church?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am shocked this has gotten so much attention. In the end, does it really matter? We should just be happy that people want to take the sacrament.

My ward only uses gluten free bread and I barely notice the difference. </TEXT>
