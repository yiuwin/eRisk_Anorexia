	<TEXT> One of the reasons I love them. Pretty sure they give away a guitar at every show. I know they did when I saw them and I've seen multiple videos when they do it. This one stood out for me though :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! :) hopefully over the summer I'll be able to get more work done on it. Possibly rework some of the levels in an updated version. I've got 3 months off from Uni after next week. 

I'm glad you enjoyed it! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I created all the assets apart from the sound effects :) Everything else was created by myself. Admittedly given the 12 week time scale I could have done a lot more. I found myself struggling to stay on track. I could have easily doubled the content. However I felt the levels were becoming bland and I was struggling to make them feel interesting. 

Thanks for your review! I'll definitely work on the audio. I'm glad you enjoyed it! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the detailed review!! I'll definitely look into the points you have made. I did struggle with making the levels seem interesting. I felt at point the gameplay was getting bland so I decided to mix it up a little with the rocket and sub. I feel like I'd hindered myself from the start with the movement mechanics. If I was to make this game again I'd definitely add some variety in the jump, for example, the longer you hold the higher/further you can jump. 

Thanks again for your review! I'm very glad you enjoyed it!! :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have made a few small prototypes in the past but this is my first full game. I have been working on it for the past 12 weeks as part of a University submission. The unit was to develop my portfolio so this is my game. Here are some details about it:

2D Platformer

Depleting Health while moving

Traditional Storyline

I hope you like it! I'd love some feedback!

	<TEXT> Hello, my dad has accidently thrown out my Wacom pen thinking it was a pen that did not work. I was about to order the pen I needed for my tablet, (LP190K, I believe this is the correct pen for tablet which has a model number of CTH-690AK-S) 

I was just getting to the checkout when I noticed that there is no option for the county to be the United Kingdom or England. I can't seem to find their UK store anywhere? 

Thanks in advance :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I'm hoping for...is for DICE (or for EA to allow DICE) to add ALL battlefront maps to Battlefront II. Then each iteration of the game would simply add a new era while still allowing all previous eras to be playable. This would also reduce the decrease in player Base that BF1 will see upon release of BFII.  </TEXT>
