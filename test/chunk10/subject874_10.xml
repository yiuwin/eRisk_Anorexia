	<TEXT> It's mostly a matter of opinion, but I cite the following:
* No one's skin is as white as white fabric, so it contrasts and can make skin look darker, you do need a tiny bit of a tan for it to work. Don't expect dramatic improvement.
* As a photographer, I notice that a camera's light meter will overexpose a person's skin when they are wearing darker colors , making them look whiter, and skin will be underexposed when wearing lighter colors, making them look darker. This only applies in portraits where the subject takes up much of the frame.

Her: "I start up the computer, but it goes right into safari with a gray screen and Pat's (her husband) name"

Me: "Are you saying someone else is logged into safari, like into a different google account?"

Her: "No, it's like everything is different. I don't know what's going on."

Me: ...

Me: (I know she and her husband have similar computers) "Are you sure this is your computer, and not Pat's?"

Her:... "Oh my gosh... it's Pat's! But it was where I always keep my computer!"

Me: "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"

Her: "Do not post this on Facebook!"

Me: "OK, mom" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good tip, less decisions in the morning make everything smoother. Also - take a cool shower in the morning. Not freezing, just cold enough that it's not comfortable at first, but your body gets used to it in a short time. Getting in is not pleasant, but the rest of the morning you will feel awesome and awake. </TEXT>
