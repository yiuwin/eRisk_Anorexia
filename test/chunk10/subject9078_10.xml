	<TEXT> The leader of that country's biggest far-right party becomes their head of state. So, for example, if you want to make Macron the US president, Le Pen becomes the French president.

	<TITLE> Has Eastern Europe always been poorer than Western Europe, and if so, why? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Usually, when this question is asked, the response is that WWII and the Cold War ruined Eastern Europe, or that the agricultural and industrial revolutions began in Britain and not in Eastern Europe.

But a while ago I ran into [this interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2kf3qq/why_didnt_the_romans_conquer_poland_or_eastern/cll356f/) about the Romans in Eastern Europe:
The Romans were mostly interested in conquering areas that had a high degree of self sufficiency which could provide a tax base for them to extract from. Poland and eastern europe (as well as parts of Germany) did not have the higher level of urbanism at this time as in comparison with some Celtic Gallic settlements, which were in many ways already integrated into the Roman trade network in the case of southern Gaul.

This is interesting because it shows that the wealth divide between Eastern and Western Europe existed long before the modern era. I'm thinking the USSR isn't the reason why the non-Balkan east is poor, so from a wider historical perspective, what's the real reason? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not immediately obvious whether a certain election is realigning or not. In 2008, a lot of people thought the Sixth Party System had ended, but now, with wide Republican control of the government, there's less consensus about that. It's possible 2016 may be seen as a realigning election, with the Republicans moving away from Reagan-esque conservatism, though that's seeming less likely as Trump moves toward the center.

Ironically, Trump may end up significantly delaying the next major political shift, by showing how much worse a potential realignment would be.

	<TEXT> At the local level, it's still valuable for Republicans to court Asian Americans. In 2009, R-allied Michael Bloomberg narrowly won the New York City mayoral election, but he won the Asian American vote in a landslide, which likely delivered him the victory:

In the race for Mayor, 62% of Asian American voters favored Republican Michael Bloomberg over Democrat William Thompson. Most Asian ethnic groups--68% of Chinese Americans and 65% of Korean Americans--supported Bloomberg by a wide margin.

	<TEXT> You can have more representation for presently disenfranchised nations without a global popular vote.

I said there wouldn't be a global popular election.

Let these people be skilled technocrats, not skilled demogogues.

Okay, let's make a compromise. Under the new system, the public gets to vote, at specified time intervals, about whether the technocrats get to keep their jobs. But they don't elect the replacements. Those are appointed as in the current system. This makes the election of Trump to the IMF impossible, but at the same time holds the unelected accountable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting. I agree with most of what you said. My only worry is how you set an arbitrary line about what issues voters can or cannot have a say about. You say monetary policy is too complicated for voters to have such a direct voice in... But then what about the presidency? You would presumably need to spend a lifetime studying politics, law, and economics to become a good president, but obviously there have been some presidents that did not do this. In some ways, being able to directly elect the president is even riskier, because the Fed Chair only controls monetary policy, whereas a head of state can appoint any number of people to do anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was talking about democracy vs. technocracy, not representative vs. direct democracy. Representation is a reasonable compromise between direct democracy and technocracy, which is why I would favor it for the most powerful financial institutions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's what the IMF and the World Bank were originally designed to be, but they've taken up a lot more responsibility over the last few decades. They're not just American financial tools anymore -- they hold up the economies of poor and financially-devastated countries across the world. And with the loans they give come a long list of requirements and conditionals for government policy, which affect hundreds of millions of people.

IFIs right now are under the control of a shadowy group of people who really don't want the public to know exactly what they do. What they do is necessary, but it has to come with democratic openness and debate. And the whole world should be allowed to pitch in, because the whole world, not just the US, is affected. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The pedantic answer is that 2+2=4 only because of how mathematicians have defined the symbols, the operator, and the base 10 number system. Without those arbitrary rules, mathematical expressions are gibberish.

This is sort of why people disagree on politics. To believe in a certain ideology, you have to hold a set of core, but arbitrary, assumptions. Everything you believe is built off of that. If you don't share your friend's assumptions, his political views will sound like gibberish. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to ask, did you think about this yourself, or are you just asking the masses?

Both? I was bored.

I find it sad that whenever something becomes too technical for the people to decide, we say that the people can't decide, instead of using the situation as an opportunity to educate. Oh well. </TEXT>
