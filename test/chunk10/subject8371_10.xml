	<TEXT> There was once a young man who, in his youth, professed his desire to become a great poet.

When asked to define "Great" he said, "I want to write stuff that the whole world will read, stuff that people will react to on a truly emotional level, stuff that will make them scream, cry, no, howl in pain and anger!"

He now works for Microsoft, writing error messages. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I looked into this thinking Bill Nye The Science Guy for whatever reason. I instantly ruled it out doe to the letter differentials and the size differences. I ran it through anagram-solver.net and found...nothing. I then thought of the principle of entropy. That led me to look up who wrote the first papars on it and I decided to go back to entropy as an ancient greek probably won't be appearing on GT Live...I came across the 4 laws of entropy. The 1st law of thermodynamics, the second law, the third law and Zeroths law of thermodynamics. 

After that, I gave up because I suck at life. </TEXT>

The three of them laughed and then the second guy says, "Wow, a similar thing happened to me too! Alright, so, my family also had a family dinner last night. I wanted to ask my daughter if I can taste the PUDDING that she made, but it came out as "Can I have a taste of your PUSSY? My wife is divorcing me now." 

More laughing ensued and the first guy says "You're so lucky..." when the third guy says:

"That's nothing! We had a massive dinner yesterday. Almost my entire extended family was there. We were all sitting at the big table, and just a few minutes after we started eating I wanted to ask my wife if she can pass me the SALT, but instead I stuttered and said 'YOU RUINED MY LIFE YOU FUCKING WHORE!'"  </TEXT>
