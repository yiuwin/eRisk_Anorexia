	<TEXT> So I was referring to this quote from Sirius while they're looking at the Black family tree:

 'No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemort's orders, more likely; I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don't just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It's a lifetime of service or death.'

Sirius doesn't believe Voldemort killed him either, but his first sentence implies that others believed that Voldemort murdered him. Maybe I'm looking too far into it, but that's what I understood from it when I first read it.

You're totally correct, u/appleandwatermelonn

This is the quote you were looking for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've come to realise that when someone says they were killed by [powerful wizard], it doesn't always mean directly killed. Like Regulus Black being "killed by Voldemort" in his previous descriptions, but he was merely killed by the trap that Voldemort had set.

I do hope Krum's grandfather is a character we get to see though. And if he's not directly shown, I hope they at least make mention of it to strengthen the link between Fantastic Beasts and the rest of Harry Potter. Like how Kreacher described Regulus being killed. </TEXT>

It's fine if it registers to your account, but it should be disabled until the hatch animation occurs. It may require one new field in their Pokmon database table or a little extra code in the client side. It should be easy. </TEXT>

I initially thought it was just a random visual bug because a Growlithe still popped up and I successfully caught it during this sticky loading icon.

However, after a few minutes, Pokmon stopped spawning for an entire 5 minutes or so, even though I was under the speed limit and staying around my area's most common spawn points. I spun a Pokstop in this time and a Gym was accessible near me so I didn't just NOT have any service.

Is it possible that the speed limit was lowered even further? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, guys. First time here. Not 100% sure of the subreddit rules etc. Please go easy on me.

So I'm working on an app and I basically need to plot my current location... but also a list of home users who are requesting a service.

The user needs to know where they are and needs to see where someone has requested a service as well.

I can get these two things to work individually, but they overwrite each other when I try them together.

Any idea how I get this to work?

EDIT: Just a rough explanation would be sufficient.

EDIT: If there's a post you can refer me to, please do that :)

Reddit's search function works as well as some of my own terrible code

EDIT: Going to try a few things first. Thank you.

	<TEXT> Okay, cool... but all your suggestions are related to damage from Isaac's own tears or the environment. I guess I meant a familiar that could directly damage you with no relation to the environment or what tears you have. I'll clarify above.

I personally think what you said would be a known risk.

If you have Ipecac tears, you should know that tears will damage you.

If you break an obstacle, you should know what may happen.

And these actions can easily occur with your own upgrades (Ipecac, Dr Fetus, Leo, Thunder Thighs).

i.e. It's not the actual familiar doing something to damage you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (EDIT: Self-harming to Isaac. Not a familiar that cuts itself. :P

Also, I only refer to the list of familiars that don't harm you willingly. 

e.g. Obviously Razor Blade will harm you. So we'll already know that.)

-----

I just lost a run because Bomb Bag dropped a troll bomb on me (I think. It could have just been the room's drop).

In addition, I lost a previous run because Dark Bum spawned a spider in a Sheol room and I didn't see it against the damn black floor.

Is there a list of all familiars that could possibly damage you?

-----

EDIT:

Okay, so:

* Bumbo
* Bum Friend
* Bomb Bag
* Dark bum
* Bob's Brain (Definitely died to this before)
* BBF (Definitely died to this before too)
* Lil Delirium </TEXT>

Don't forget that if you have 10 familiars, ALL of them get doubled.

It's definitely not just 20/20.

I usually make the effort to get familiars like Charged Baby and Dry Baby because when you double them, their freeze or damage effects become really effective. </TEXT>
