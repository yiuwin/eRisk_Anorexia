	<TEXT> The Court of Owls is the beginning of the run. Most of the stories last for two volumes, like you absolute Court. Riddler's story is based in the first year of Batman. The Joker's story technically starts Batman Eternal (which is also Snyder) so you can find out why he is in his current condition but its not too important to know. All in all, yeah. Jump in as you please.

Whats your current read? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love your dedication. I actually watched the 1920s book one and the casino one. The others I actually guessed by googling "star trek ______ episode" and guessed the cowboy one. I even saw a Shakespearean one I believe?

"Where no one has gone before" was kinda of a stab at other shows and plotlines we have seen tons of times before. Every show goes to a western time, Robin Hood ripoff, or a casino. 

Either way, I agree with you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Started cigarettes: age 14

Started weed: day before I turned 15

Quit cigarettes: 21-23 (took me a while. One thing that helped was after a few days of not smoking, I hung out with my mom who smoked menthol cigarettes. The harshness of the smell of that constantly for a full day made me sick.)

I used to do a bunch of other drugs but quit those as well at around age 25. I am 32 and weed is my only vice. I barely drink. My advice: get good shit and try to use in moderation. The moderation bit is gonna be hard as well as not trying to smoke a cigarette (the smell of a Black N' Mild still gets me) but being only on weed is a lot more chill and open minded then having all that other junk in your system. If you got a hobby, get more involved in it. I make music and there is definitely a difference between getting high and doing it 
 for a long period of time then stopping for cigarette breaks constantly. 

TLDR Quit cigs 10 years ago. It was tough but things are now more fun just high.  

Good luck. </TEXT>

I honestly cannot tell you why. Its feels nostalgic in a way especially the Animaniacs. I got to take a pic with the voices from the show and they are holding up their pops.
 Maybe its because of my sister's beanie baby collection when we were kids. One of the fun things is the hunt. Its the same reason people collect puzzles or model trains or cat posters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Love that Obie Trice track. You'll recognize the very beginning as it was sampled as the start of (i believe) Without Me.

Since you are young, how much Eminem have you listened to? Have you dug deep into the rare tracks? Just wondering, with me being 32 and have owned every album one time or another, do you know of his collection or are there albums you have yet to hear? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bet it All on Black Garlic Burger. You can find black garlic at Central Market or Trader Joes. Its garlic that is fermented to the point it is soft and gooey. Its like garlic dipped in molasses. You make a mayo out of it that is amazing with fries as well as the burger. We also did the Onion Ring Around the Rosemary Burger and the Bleu is the Warmest Burger that were pretty amazing as well. </TEXT>
