	<TEXT> Remarks like that are plenty from the extreme elements in both communities. 

As for the new chief minister, I happen to live in the capital of that state, in Lucknow, and it's a Hindu majority state. While he's been fucking with stuff like beef, I can assure you that Muslims here have no fear of him or his party. 

And Pakistani policies have consisted of much more than just "being barred from criticising Islam."
Remember that in Pakistan every single minority has dwindled to almost nothing. They committed a genocide when East Pakistan failed to assimilate with West Park's culture.

	<TEXT> Outlets have said he compared Leslie Jones to Harambe in a vid where he asked a bot "What if Harambe was alive" and the bot returned a pic of Leslie Jones. 
They've written that his clothes and hair show his affinity to the alt right movement. They've taken clips from videos where he was making fun of people claiming he was a Nazi and used them to prove he is a Nazi. How is that fair, I ask you?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd be okay if they backfired. If people said he shouldn't have made those jokes, or to say those jokes were in poor taste. But WSJ and the accompanying outlets are making him out to be an alt-righter and a Nazi. 
I didn't look at his apology vids and then decide this. I'd seen the offending videos within minutes of him uploading them. As the whole story has progressed I've seen the unfair judgment he's received. 

The media HAS intentionally smeared him. He maybe deserved a reaction but not this overblown campaign against him. What do you do when the media does that? He's called them out and now he's being chided for blaming the media as if he doesn't want to take any responsibility. </TEXT>
