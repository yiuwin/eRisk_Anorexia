	<TEXT> No, that's fine, at least now I understand why the JP voices appeal to people so much. I'm not much for anime or manga (but I do like light novels a bit) so I don't really know how to pick up on the subtler parts of how Japanese express emotion, and the language, while nice to listen to, can go by a bit fast, which makes the dialogue seem a little stilted to me. And as for Metal Face, I didn't particularly dislike his Japanese voice actor, I just felt that the English one far outshone him because I could really feel the emotion in his voice, all the hatred and anger for Dunban, as well as cold-blooded derision for the rest, and it made the game that much better, which, to me, is the sign of a good voice actor. Oh well, perhaps one day I'll start liking the Japanese acting, and then I'll have a new way to enjoy the game! One XC fan to another, good discussion here! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are the Japanese voices really that good to a lot of people? Personally I found them to be a little emotionless or rushing through the dialogue, and the English voices to be much more expressive (@metal face). I'm not trying to shit on any opinions, I just want to understand why the Japanese voices appeal to people so much here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if this was said in a previous thread, but if you stick a sonic arrow to a Reinhardt barrier and he drops it, the arrow will continue flying and deal damage to Reinhardt (assuming you shot it at his hurt box obviously) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not just the spike, but he also gets a new casing for his torso, his claws become hooked at the end and are thicker, instead of ending in a point, his face gets a black lower jaw, his wings get a little longer, and his cannon gets a white panel on it reminiscent of his old face, and some new spikes. Oh and his legs get wider. There are a whole bunch of tinier details too, but I'm sure you can spot them. These are the cool details that I noticed about Metal Face on Prison Island, and I just think it's  absolutely awesome that Takahashi decided to give one of the best portrayed villains an upgrade. Faced Mechon for life! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll just give a basic rundown of the most powerful builds I know. Ether Blossom: Blossom Dance, Ghostwalker, Core Crusher, Aura Assault, Inner Search, lots of potential. This build allows you to shred pretty much anything in seconds with literally no risk at all. For Skell, you want dual diskbombs for your side arms, but make sure that the right one has mag up trait on it. This trait allows you to spam diskbombs non stop by switching constantly between the two sidearms, also you need a lailah lvl 60 skell so you can maintain infinite overdrive and be essentially unkillable. These are the two strongest builds IMO. Sorry for bad formatting (mobile) and how vague I was about each build. There's just so much optimization I could cover that I feel it would take multiple posts to cover it all. Anyway, you should be able to find the rest of what you need if you intend to follow these builds both on this sub and GameFAQ's. Happy soul-crushing grinding! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah, Effect Stasis is redundant with Supercharge since the buff disappears once you hit something, no matter what. That would be mildly concerning if Effect Stasis affected Supercharge like what you suggested. </TEXT>
