	<TEXT> I agree with this post. What do we achieve by constantly shitposting and using their shitty tactics against them? As fucked up as some their views are, they still care for this country, as much as any of us do, so this "us or them" mentality isn't going to solve anything but create more problems and deepen the division between each other. By constantly alienating them, we're making it worse than it is, their members get more and more "close-knit", and their views more and more extreme.  </TEXT>
