	<TEXT> Why would that be offensive?

A dude being turned into something he doesn't usually like, if that's too serious you can just play it as comedy.

"Oh not this shit again dammit" -Sup nigga "Shut up I'm not a nigg.. oh wait I am, DAMN" 

He already has that snarky-dissatisfied look on himself, it'd be funny seeing him do his Hero job while he's deeply uncomfortable. 

Maybe some day he'd end up learning how to rap and ducking it out with the hood, learning the value of friendship and understanding blacks more once he starts having problems with the police even if he didn't do anything bad, sorta like Spiderman.

There's LOTS of potential so I am REALLY upset about Don just calling it an insult to everybody as if it was obvious. No, it's not obvious that it's a bad idea, I can pretty much write like 10 good stories with it right now and they would sell like hot bread if they weren't taken down by some organization. </TEXT>

His "Ultimate Hairstyle" was the exact same hair he had before Elder Kai awakened his power.

Seeing him powering up just to grow a bang on Super looks ridiculous. He should have never changed hairstyle, or at least he should have kept the bang after re-growing it by training.

It reminds me of Ultra Trunks hair, he had Broly-like hair back in the Cell saga because his hair was longer after training in the HTC, while on Super it grows to that lenght just because </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's all skill at that point, since a mostly dead Suiryu has enough strenght to damage him, I say at full health he could kill him if he got those sweet combos on his face.

He's on Bakuzan's level or close to, since I'm sure he couldn't damage any part of Gouketsu's body.

But yeah, maybe a serious Bakuzan could kill him really fast. But I doubt he wasn't already serious, Bakuzan doesn't seem the type to pull back his punches like Gouketsu </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We can finally agree that Suiryu is low dragon level at last. And yes I'm saying this because he broke Bakuzan's toe.

Gouketsu was impressed and named Bakuzan a Dragon, a thing he didn't do with Choze. 

Yes, Choze could hurt Suiryu, but very few humans can just ignore damage coming from a Demon threat. Those things are strong, just remember how Puri Puri Prisoner got punched once by Sea King and was already badly injured. Bang also got stunned by that tentacle alien. There's no shame in not tanking demons Saitama style.

And Suiryu only took that much damage because he had to protect the girl from Choze's beam, in a regular fight he would have just dodged and quickly killed him the same way. 

It was a really fast fight, I think Suiryu could have killed at least 4 other Chozes one after another.

Suiryu was still sure he could take on someone stronger, it'd be a little harder but he wasn't at his limits. He knew how strong Choze was and wasn't feeling hopeless against a stronger foe. His only mistake was taking Gouketsu on, that guy is High Dragon, you'd need several S class heroes for it.

But if instead of Gouketsu the next monster had been Bakuzan, THAT would have been a real fight to push Suiryu to his limits and end up winning. 

I mean, we saw Gouketsu totally destroying Suiryu to a point where he thought the crows could eat him as food. By that pont he's already half dead... and even then he still had strenght to jump over the freaking Stadium but Bakuzan striked him down. 

AND HE SURVIVED. A Dragon threat punched him straight to the ground and he could still stand up, and then Bakuzan gives him ANOTHER BEATING intending to finally kill him but it's still not enough AND THE MADMAN SUIRYU HAS ENOUGH STRENGHT LEFT IN HIS SINGLE ARM TO BREAK BAKUZAN'S FINGER WITHOUT LEVERAGE.

After reading all that, can you seriously see a healthy Suiryu going ham on Bakuzan as if he were Gouketsu and Bakuzan surviving? No you can't, praise Suiryu

If he could break his finger with an arm, just imagine him comboing his face. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a Morde main and at least at low elo, he's my safest top, that would be his best position.

As you said, most people don't play him so they don't know his strenghts; a cocky Darius or Riven will go in and eat your whole Q combo to give you first blood.

Also, you farm with your W, so each time they get close to last hit or harass you they eat some damage from your spiky shield while you are last hitting some other minion. It's a really OP skill.                                           

Morde farms a lot, and I mean a lot, even at disavantage. You will die to ranged champions tho, so don't pick him into them. 

At my peak I beat some Teemos and Kennens but they were clearly playing them for their first time. 

But that disadvantage only matters at duels, your W can be used to farm at a distance against any champion (you see a minion low in health, send W to a close ally and re-activate it). It's slow but at least you'll be getting some gold.

Just practice some Morde and you'll see, once you start snowballing he'll make the enemy team surrender at 20. He gets big advantage of early kills. Once you get Rylai's, an R is a death sentence, it's permaslow.

And of course, you go AP Tank, not full squishy, that won't get you far.


His supposed best position is mid due to proximity to dragon, but that's a lie; most mid champions are ranged and will destroy him. You can pick him into assassins tho, easy victory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually support Suiryu being low dragon, I think he could beat Bakuzan if he was healed.

I mean, Bakuzan gave him a really strong hit (he probably intended to kill him with it) in the sky and Suiryu, who was almost dead by then, could STILL get up.

I think it could go either way, I don't see Bakuzan casually tanking Suiryu's punches like Gouketsu.

	<TEXT> I'd like a DarkSouls-esque ending, with Guts managing to kill the savior of the world, Griffith, while people oblivious to his true nature are shocked. Then everything would begin the collapse as the magic is leaving Earth and the world would be sent to an age of darkness.

Actually... what I'm describing is very similar to the ending of the Tower of Conviction arc. That was lit, I'd like it again.

I think it fits with the theme of the series. Guts killing Griffith and separating the planes, back to how it was supposed to be, saying farewell to Puck and maybe to Schierke too if she becomes an astral entity and chooses to remain in another world.

Guts would be letting mankind decide their own fates and pick up the pieces to rebuild the world; a human world.

All that fate and causality thing, I think it truly pisses Guts off and Miura has been talking about it for decades, it'd be a good ending if Guts just destroys that system. Actually, he MUST destroy it, since he is "fated" to go to hell once he dies, and I don't see Berserk ending with our hero going to suffer for all eternity. Removing the brand would be simpler, but I'd rather he gets rid of causality.

Of course, a timeskip would be needed before all that, something like 10 years, so it'd have more of an impact when the world returns to normal (since they became so accustomed to working with magical entities) 

...Or maybe Guts could end up teaming up with Griffith and slaying God, for reasons, that would be a cool ending too. </TEXT>

It's like a big family right now and it shows since we even saw him laughing in the last chapters.

	<TEXT> It's my favorite arc precisely because it feels more shounen-y, that was much needed after so many tragedies.

We finally get an "organization" of enemies, probably my favorite thing in every battle manga; a crazy Priest (I happen to love evil priests) and his executors, I mean, that's hella cool. 

Also it has the best drawings in all of berserk, at least for me, I saved a lot of pages from the Tower of Conviction.

I loved their wings and the dark setting, evil angels... torture chambers...

BUT, the most important part, is that the arc feels rewarding... I don't know how to explain it. Guts finally felt like a hero, yeah, a super hero, it was an heroic arc. Before this, he was a mercenary killing dudes in a war or fighting bloodlusted demons from hell as revenge.

Here we see Guts fighting to save people from a gray villain. Random demons don't really do it for me as villains since, well, they are demons, they are obviously evil. And Mozgus was a crazy bastard but he believed himself to be good, not even Griffith does that. I even felt bad for his death, he was trying to save people. 

After all those arcs with Guts dragging through the mud all alone with a lot of despair and feelings of revenge, we finally get to see him going "DON'T TOUCH MY CASCA" and kicking some angel ass with the power of love while everyone just stands there with their mouths open... It's an arc with a lot of hype, yeah, it's good at hyping me.

The best way to put it would be that, when he finally beats Mozgus, I was like "YES! YEES! YEEEESSSSS!!!!" overjoyed, it truly felt like he saved the day, well, at least he saved Casca's day. 

And I'll tell you, I didn't get that kind of joy when he defeated the Count or any other demon that I remember. I mean, yeah, Guts changed a lot here, now that I remember, Guts was a crazy psycho stabbing the Count while his daughter watched.

One of my happiest memories (happy memories in Berserk? See, this arc is special) would be when Guts jumps out of the tower and dives his sword right in Mozgus. Lots of bad things happened and there was no glimpse of hope, everyone was rioting and about to burn Casca as a witch. I also felt bad for the bird guy, I hoped he would join the team.

As a side note, I actually pulled out my Bleach OST to read these chapters, it paired so well. 

When Guts jumped out of the tower and fell on Mozgus I listened Ichigo's theme. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lsn2tT5yTc

Then I also listened to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GheBtkD7TQ

But what I listened to the most, before the Mozgus final fight, would be Forces II, from Berserk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZQy9a04SxA 

Forces II goes really well with everything in the Tower of Conviction arc, really. I remember those dark blobs going rampant, everyone running, the executors transforming and SkullKnight coming to save the day while "HAAAIII YAIII FORCES" plays on the background. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't get people trying to justify it by saying Goku was holding back when in the same 5 seconds they also say #17 was holding back as well.

You all gotta take a hint, by dialogue and what was shown, it is implied that #17 is close to Goku's level and could hurt him. I mean, Goku got excited in that fight, they were shown clashing punches and Toei has been hyping up #17; their intent is clear.


...And that doesn't make any sense, really. I get that they wanna make a good show and they need more non-saiyan fighters, but they aren't even trying to explain it.

If this happened back in DBZ, they'd find some explanation, even if it was bad. Maybe #17 saying "Guess what? Gero's modifications make us grow stronger with time even without training"

Nope, not even 4 months of training. This shits all over the theme of the show, training to get greater power. Some random dude (because since Cell saga, #17 may as well be a farmer with a shotgun) goes off to an island to protect animals and becomes a freaking god.

This leaves us with the question, where was #17 when Buu was destroying the world? Because this 17 could have annihilated Buu. And forget about Vegeta's rage and Super Saiyan God, #17 was the real challenge on Earth for Beerus.

It makes no sense to have someone at God level (not even at Buu's level, he was the ultimate enemy on Z) without training for it. So if some dude does 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats and runs 10 km will he be able to beat Beerus? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> EXACTLY, THIS

 "Krillin can win against Gohan by outsmarting him", if people are Ok with this, try to imagine Krillin in Super Buu's place, fighting against a serious Gohan and managing to kick him away by being smart. Or stalling Cell for some time instead of getting broken in 0,1 seconds.

That would have been just outrageous. 

Super would be better if they just gave humans some real power boost, no matter how ridiculous, something like Whis unlocking their powers or training in a better hyperbolic time chamber for 10 years. 

Just remember the Ginyu Force, the elite force that conquered the galaxy and stuff, I still don't see the humans beating them if they invaded earth. No matter what trick they tried to pull off, I mean, Recoome just broke all of Krillin's body, "the strongest human", with a single kick.

And their leader Frieza could kill the entire Ginyu force while sleeping. Then you get the androids, and Cell, and Buu... Between Mystic Gohan and Krillin there already is a gap as big as Beerus and SSJ3 Goku at the beginning of Super. 

But they aren't trying to patch up that gap, nope, just being tactical and stuff allows you to suddenly be on the level of people millions of times stronger than you. Power scaling was actually a big part even on early DB, Tao Pai Pai killed General Blue with just his tongue. 

One thing is hiding the whole fight and then landing a surprise Destructo-disc/Tri-beam Cannon/Mafuuba, as those were stated to be far beyond the user's level, but being able to actually see, dodge and tank Cell-tier enemies should be impossible to most of them.  </TEXT>

It's all about what % of power they are using, just like Cell at first was having a fair fight with Goku   Trunks until he dcided to power up </TEXT>

I can only conclude that eyes protected by nen are even harder than the rest of the body because no one ever tries poking them.

	<TITLE> Mono STR beating SSJ4 Vegeta </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-10 00:04:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> http://imgur.com/a/ehfM9

I think I broke Mono STR

By slapping a Golden Frieza and Janemba on it, you become pretty much unbeatable. It was a double Goku lead because I wanna use my heroes to their full potential.

Pretty much every phase before SSJ4 ended in 1-2 turns so I didn't take real damage. 

Now in the final phase, Goku hits around 300k without crits, that's pretty great considering the type disadvantage, and a million if he gets a crit. 

The Goku linking with Omega takes pretty much no damage from basic attacks after 2 Supers and has the chance to counter SAs to make up for the lack of sealers.

Janemba and Golden Frieza are rotating units unless absolutely necessary.

Janemba takes 30k from SAs and tanks basic hits pretty well.
 
Golden is dead weight without his passive, heroes tank better than him so you gotta play around it.

Gogeta has the right path unlocked so I have him with 5700 extra attack and I don't know how much defense, but he has 27k defense in-fight, Goku needs 2 Supers to surpass him, so he's a great tank. His attack goes up to 619k when linked with Goku and frequently crits for a million.

And Trunks is the real MVP of the team. His 25% attack AND defense really help each turn he shows up, and since it is a passive, you can keep him all the way in the third spot and it'll benefit the unit in the first position (Maybe you must have Gogeta - Golden - Trunks in that order)

Also, with Trunks, Gogeta goes all the way up to 750k base attack when supering and that's extremely awesome. I'd change him for GT SSJ3 Goku if I had him tho.

So yeah, with those 2 clutches I'd still call it Mono STR. Whatever 2 STR units you would use instead of Janemba and Golden will probably add very little and won't help you survive. When 3 units hit close to a millions you should focus on what they can't do; tank.

For the record, I could have avoided using a senzu and yenma if I played better. I ended up under 50% for less than 1000 hp so Frieza couldn't tank and I used a Yenma, then I used a Senzu even tho I could have tanked Vegeta's SA by moving Janemba to the second slot but I didn't want to break the Goku - Omega rotation (Omega ate 120k damage)

I want to remark that if it could beat the latest boss with type disadvantage, that team can probably kill anything.

Goku being STR is especially good because STR also has Gogeta, so you aren't having dead turns, you'll always be doing heavy damage to the boss even if he's AGL </TEXT>
