	<TEXT> Also made another variant that uses Card of Demise. Basically I run 3 each of Call of the Haunted, Return to the Frontlines and Oasis of Dragon Souls with Soul Charge. I draw through most of my deck using Cards of consonance, allure of darkness, trade-in and demise, and end up discarding Arcana Force XXI - Za Warudo to be revived by the aforementioned traps. 
I also use Armageddon Knight and Level Eater, so that I always have fodder for Za Warudo. 

The deck can make some pretty nice plays. Given the chance, I can summon Harbinger Dragon or Crystal Wing or True King of all Calamities. I incorporated the Blue-Eyes engine (3 Blue-Eyes, 3 Stones of Legends) to accelerate draws. Works well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is.
I was thinking of doing something like that, but instead of using merchant and soul charge, I'd use a 60-card Grass with Zombie World, Mezuki and Vampires. 
Hopefully it will work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see. Most Zoo players I end up playing against end up (or ended up ... I haven't played against Zoo after Hammerkong's release) with Emeral and Drident having at most 1300 atk, with a side of Tiger King/ random xyz monster. That can cause some hefty damage but it's not an otk. Of course, if you don't stop them right then and there, you lose by next turn.  </TEXT>

(That's the problem when you've played only Blue-Eyes since you started playing YGO: you know only one deck. On the bright side, I can teach most variants)

I'd like to learn:

 - Modern Nekroz (By "modern" I mean Nekroz beyond the Djinn Lock because I don't see what the deck does beyond that).
 - Any form of a link deck.
 - Any deck that can make good use of the Terrortop engine and the Windwitch engine together, except Invoked and Speedroid.  </TEXT>

I tweaked it a bit too, so that it focuses more on Neutron Blast and less on the Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon because each time I summoned him to attack, I would get veilered, kuribohed, fiendished or something. 
I added 3 neutron blast and removed one twister. I also removed the dark holes and the foolish for a master and the other neutron blasts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I hope Buster Blader does not become more popular. He's the ultimate Blue-Eyes counter. Nonetheless, I'm sure Blue-Eyes could do decently well as a rogue deck. Then again, in this format rogue decks aren't that good.
Yeah links could provide a good boost to Blue-Eyes. I was looking at Star Grails. They provide some interesting normal support. For instance, they have a dragon that you can banish from the graveyard to summon a normal monster from the graveyard. Looks like it was made to work with Dragon Shrine. 
I don't think a Cyverse BEWD link would be that nice. I'd rather have a dragon BEWD link to stay in-theme. At least he can benefit from Return. 

Incidentally, I've been testing the Terrortop engine in Blue-Eyes. Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy provides some good protection against Raigeki and the like, but if the opponent outs him, you are done for, whereas Dark Matter eschews protection for power plays and recovery. The Terrortop engine can help you bring both protection and power plays. Basically just summon Terrortop and overlay for Totem Bird. Totem Bird has practically the same effect as Harbinger, but it can also negate traps if need be. It's a one-time deal, but between Goliath, Dark Matter and Blue-Eyes, your opponent will have a hard time playing. I also run Leviair just in case I want to do something with the Stones </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could have sworn that it was already rogue. Then again, I don't know the meta that well. 

Tyranno is probably the most broken card recently released after Master in Pieces and True King of Youcan'tplaytoday. Raigeki on legs plus super Book of Moon is way, way too OP. And miscellaneous traps like Strike can't hit him. At least with Master you can Kaiju him. Tyranno can't even be hit by Kaijus because he'll just use his effect beforehand. 

It would be hilarious if Konami made a card called Ice Age:

If your opponent controls a dinosaur-type monster, your opponent cannot negate this card's activation. If your opponent has at least 1 dinosaur-type monster in their deck, on their field, in their hand and in their graveyard, banish face-down all dinosaur-type monsters your opponent controls, in their hand, on their field and in their graveyard. Then special summon one Furry Master Race.  </TEXT>

If I remember correctly, when xyzs came out, xyz materials were considered to be on the field, so if you detached Sangan, it would be like he was sent from the field to the graveyard.

	<TEXT> Hello.

So I'm still trying to learn links, and I was trying to come up with engines that give good links. So far I have:

Gofu the Hazy Shadow. If summoned by its own effect its a  link 3.

Tour Guide + plus Sangan. Links give the opportunity to do what xyzs did not. Summon Link 2, establish your board and search for Ash Blossoms or Maxx "C" while you're at it. 

Speedroid Terror + Take. A free link two. 

Scapegoat. That card is a link 4 all by its own.

And my personal favourite:

Predaplant engine.
Basically summoning Scorpio, then summoning Cobra, and searching for instant fusion to use it for Norden is a link 4. Or you could search for Brilliant Fusion, which can give a link 4 just as easily, going up to link 5 (does that even exist) if you send Wulf or Trick Clown.

What ideas did you have for links?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see. So your goto R8nk is Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy?
Normally I go for Dark Matter as soon as possible, because I easily lock my opponent using Goliath or Felgrand, and I have some form of recovery in Stone. Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy protects me better, but I gain a lot more advantage from Galaxy. Although, if I don't have a need for Galaxy I guess I should go into Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy more often. (Why do Wyrms exist?)
Return doesn't protect Calamities though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does. 
You could also summon Naturia Exterio, who basically locks your opponent out of their spells and traps. 

Perhaps you could run a Tarotrei engine, which is a level 9, and thus opens rank 9 plays such as True King of all Calamities with the Blue-Eyes synchros. Maybe even tech in a Chaos MAX, because you could use him with the ritual support. A field of Chaos MAX, Mounds, Exterio and Tarotrei/Calamities would be very difficult to break, and that's without factoring stuff like Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon and other good fusions. 

The deck sounds like it could have a lot of potential  </TEXT>

Kaiju  Blue-Eyes doesn't brick that often in my experience, but when it does brick, boy does it brick. Pot of Desires at least makes the deck brick less. 

The Kaiju Slumber + Return is a good play though. Personally what I like to do is have Kyoutou Waterfront on the field, most likely brought out by Ancient Fairy Dragon. Then I activate Kaiju Slumber, which nets me a minimum of 2 counters, most likely more. I take Gameciel and give the opponent Dogoran. I then summon Alternative or some other dragon to overlay with Gameciel for Cipher Dragon. I use the field to search for another Gameciel, summon him, and overlay my Cipher for Full Armour. I pop Dogoran, and go into Dark Matter. That way I can get a few negates off Gameciel while gathering resources with Dark Matter.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the very least, you might still be able to do something on the next turn, if it ever comes. If you opened Cobra and a Lonefire, you'd have nothing to play. But if you use Baobaboon, you can at least pull something off. Perhaps even draw traps or something to keep you alive till your next turn. God forbid you draw your Gem-knight without any Baobaboons. 

I guess Magical Mallet does more or less the same thing without using up the normal summon, but you go minus for that. Baobaboon is a nice choice because it self replaces and is searchable, but Vortex Trooper could work too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2 could be ideal. At the very least, drawing Baobaboon is not so much of an issue because he changes your hand, and is self-replacing. 

 3 would be okish, because you wouldn't need lonefire all the time, and if you somehow destroy it you get a free rank 3. Then again, 3 takes up a lot of space in both the deck and the extra deck, and you only want to unclog your hand. Besides, even if wanted a rank 3, the Predas do it better. 

1 might be better, but you might find yourself wanting to resolve him twice. He's searchable, so resolving him twice might not be so far fetched. And if you do get 2 on the field, so much the better. </TEXT>

Chaos MAX is a beast once it's out, but I have trouble making a good variant that doesn't brick. So far, the best variant of Chaos MAX I've used is one that techs it in rather than being centred around it. It's the Brilliant Fusion one using Yang Zings that I've outlined in the original post.

	<TEXT> Galaxy Soldier requires a light to summon by its own effect. Therefore, if I wanted to summon two in one turn, I'd have to discard two lights to do that. I'd use them for Infinity, which means that I'd go -3 in all: -1 for infinity, -1 for a soldier, and -1 for the second soldier. Furthermore, it's not that often that I'll have 2 lights I'm willing to discard, so Soldier is a bit useless then.

Galaxy Wizard lets me search any Galaxy card, unlike Soldier which brings out only monsters. I can use Wizard to search for {{Galaxy Expedition}}, which I can then use to summon my second Soldier. I need only 1 light for this, which is very doable, and I lose less cards this way, as I don't need to discard my 2nd light.
Wizard can also become lv 8 if ever I need that, so it's a normal summonable rank 8 play. IF I have Wizard and Expedition in my hand, I can not only summon Infinity, but I can also summon Dark Matter or Harbinger. It also reduces my chances of a dead draw after I summon infinity, because I don't have any galaxy cards left in my deck after I summon Wizard. 

The trade-off is that it takes up a normal summon, and there are larger chances of a dead draw before you summon Infinity, because you could draw Galaxy Expedition. Blue-Eyes doesn't need that normal summon so badly, so that's fine in most cases. Running the third Galaxy Soldier can result in dead draws, but after you summon Infinity, because you could draw the third Galaxy Soldier. However, that's arguably much better than drawing Expedition, because at least you'd already have a board established and Soldier provides a discard outlet and a monster, while Expedition is useless without the rest of the cards. Then again, you also increase your chances of dead drawing Soldier if you do not run Wizard, because how often is it that you have two lights that you are willing to discard? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Good engines/techs/hybrids for Blue-Eyes? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-13 21:02:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello.

TL;DR: What engines/techs/hybrid builds are good in Blue-Eyes?

I'm looking for ways to diversify my Blue-Eyes Decks, and as such, I'm looking for good techs, engines or hybrid builds for the Blue-Eyes. Here are some I have tried:

- Kaiju Engine (AKA Blue-Eyes Gojira)
Consists of 8 cards, which are 4 different cards run in duplicates: Gameciel, Dogoran, Kyoutou Waterfront and Interrupted Kaiju Slumber. The main idea is to use Ancient Fairy Dragon's effect to search Waterfront, accumulate Counters, and summon monsters off that. With everyone and their mother using field spells, Dragon's effect is a +1, and a 1000 extra LP. I also run one Mausoleum of White, which is invaluable for its targeting effect, graveyard set-up and double tuner summoning. Using Kyoutou Waterfront gives me a very strong negator in Gameciel, and a good monster to steal with Cipher Dragon. 

- Galaxy Soldier Engine
I run 2 galaxy soldiers, 1 Galaxy Wizard and 1 Galaxy Expedition. Doing so doesn't make me go as minus as running 3 soldiers, and I can summon infinity if I have only one light. 

- Fluffal engine. 
Very nice when it goes off, but it is very slow to set up. It also doesn't offer Blue-Eyes much other than those draws. I run 3 Bear, 3 Wings, and 3 Vendor. If anyone knows how I could improve this , it would be good.

- Rudra engine. 
Using 3 Magician of Prophecy, and 3 Rudra. Blue-Eyes has quite a few spellcasters, so the engine is not too bad. However, I'd always rather use my Spellcasters or my normal summon for something else. Again, I feel that with some tweaking, the engine could be really good. 

- Brilliant Engine. 
Now this engine is something that has a lot of potential, so much so, that I have 3 variations of it. The basic engine consists of 3 Lonefire, 1 Scorpio, 1 Cobra, 1 Lazuli and 1 Brilliant Fusion. I run 1 of everything but Lonefire because it reduces bricks by a lot. 

- The first variant requires a lv 1 tuner in hand, both predaplants on the field OR a Blue-Eyes on the field. The idea is to dump Thunder King, the Lightning Strike Kaiju off Brilliant fusion, summon your tuner and tune for Cloudcastle. Using Cloudcastle, you can revive Thunder King, and then overlay for True King of all Calamities. It's decent, but doesn't exploit Brilliant Fusion to the fullest. 

- The second variant requires a Master Peace in hand. Activate Brilliant Fusion, and tribute both the Brilliant Fusion and Seraphinite for Master Peace. He will be immune to spells and monsters that way, and you still get your free Foolish Burial, and your extra normal summon. However, I still feel that this does not do the Brilliant Fusion justice. 

- The third variant uses a very convoluted combo with Yang Zings, Trick Clown and Brilliant fusion to pull off a field with a minimum of Baxia, Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing and Jiaotu with Chiwen in the graveyard, by just having Brilliant fusion and a lv 1 tuner. Then when you use Nine Pillars, you can pop Jiaotu to go into Bi'an, summon Chiwen by its own effect and go into Herald of the Arc Light. When Herald dies, you get to search Chaos Form or Chaos MAX, and you can recycle it with Baxia, who is coincidentally a lv 8 for R8nk plays. The combo is rather strong, especially when you combine it with Infinity or the like. 
In fact, if I had Extra Deck space, I could add the Zoodiac Sub combo, because the two predaplants are left over, and could be used for an Invoker. While the deck is strong, it has to run a lot of cards you don't want to draw, and thus can result in dead draws rather often. Less often then you get to resolve the combo, but the potential for bricking badly is still there. 

- Seven Sins tech
I run Sanaphond the Sky Prison, and True king of all Calamities. When either of them run out of material, I can just overlay Pain Gainer, then Seven Sins on them. It's not bad, but I'd expect more if I have to contribute two extra deck slots. 

- Eidolon hybrid
Uses Aleister to summon Mechaba. I always lack cards in my hand for Mechaba, so I find it rather lacklustre. 

- Zoodiac hybrid. 
I run 2 Molmo, 2 Whiptail, 3 Barrage, 1 Combo, tenki, tensu, 3 terrors, and 1 taketomborg. In the Extra, I run Tigermortar, Drident, Bullhorn, Boarboar and Emeral. The basic idea is to special summon Rat, go into Boar, then Bull, and use Bull's effects to pull a Rat and a Whiptail. Whiptail overlays with Rat to summon Emeral, who can then summon a Blue-Eyes from the graveyard. It's rather decent.

- Dino hybrid.
Uses Ovi, the babies, Misc, Tyranno and Lost World. Lost World is the main focus of this deck, as it can protect Blue-Eyes while destroying a baby. Instead of going minus, I go plus if you try to destroy my Blue-Eyes. Is surprisingly decent, but that might be due to the dinos doing most of the heavy lifting here. I have a feeling it could be better if I actually knew dinos. 

- Buster Blader Hybrid
This is a nice one. It uses 3 Cradles, 2 Buster Blader (the retrain), 3 whelps, 1 Dragon Buster Destruction Sword and 2 Memories. The basic idea is to use Cradle to dump a Buster Blader and Memories to summon Buster Dragon. Then I use Memories to summon the Buster Blader fusion. I normally have spirit out at the same time, so that I can tribute it and summon Azure. Azure then protects Buster Dragon, and the fusion gains massive attack with piercing damage while preventing any monster effects from triggering. 

Any ideas of what else I could run? 
Thanks for suggestions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can only think of four relevant cards that are negate and destroy, and that too, is if the card is not in the graveyard already: Solemn Strike, Infinity, MST and Crystal Wing. 

There' so much more negation and not destroy or destroy and not negate. Ash Blossom, True King of All Calamities (who technically doesn't even negate), Nine Paths of the Yang Zing, Skill Drain, Invoked Mechaba and Gameciel all fall in the former category. Ghost Ogre, Drident, Master Peace, Bottomless Trap Hole and Twin Twisters all fall in the latter category. See? Plenty of negate but do not destroy, destroy but do not negate and very few destroy and negate



^(/s)






But seriously, it does become annoying at some point. So much negation going around is somewhat necessary though, because instead of breaking your opponent's field like we used to in ye olden days, now we must stop them from ever making their field because if they do it becomes unbreakable (Master Peace is stupid). I believe that Kaijus are more essential than ever now, because they out anything at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Predaplant engine is vastly outclassed  by Terrortop if all you want is a rank 3. Terrortop doesn't use your normal summon, is much smaller, and is a lot, lot more versatile because you can use Taketomborg for a free Clear Wing, you don't have dead draws, and is a lot harder to hit. You negate that Terrortop, the opponent has their normal summon, but if you negate that Scorpio, you lose your turn. 

The Predaplant engine is a lot better if you want a bunch of monsters at once. If you use instant fusion for instance, you can get four monsters off a normal summon (The two plants, plus norden, plus whatever you summon off norden.) I guess that's good for links, but I'm not sure because I don't know much about links.

What I do know, is that they are pretty good for Brilliant fusion. 3 Brilliants bricks, but if you run 3 Lonefire, and 1 each of the Predaplants, plus 1 brilliant, you brick less. I've tried it out in my Blue-Eyes deck, and there is one combo I particularly fond of. It basically ends with 2 negates, and Baxia, and most likely more stuff, and it only requires two cards: brilliant fusion and a lv 1 tuner. 

- Use Lonefire or Scorpio to summon Cobra, and Use Cobra to add Brilliant Fusion. 

- Use Brilliant fusion, sending Performage Trick Clown and the Gem-knight. Summon Trick off his own effect.

- Normal Summon your tuner off Seraphinite, and tune it and the Trick Clown for Denglong. Use Denglong to add Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing to your hand. 

- Use Denglong's other effect to send Jiaotu to the graveyard. Denglong is now level 2. 

- Tune Denglong and Seraphinite for  Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing. Use Denglong's effect to summon Chiwen. 

- Tune Chiwen and Yazi for Baxia. Using Baxia's effect you can shuffle two cards on the field into the deck. 

- Use Baxia's other effect on your now useless Brilliant fusion to summon Jiaotu from the graveyard. When you use Nine Pillars to negate something, you destroy Jiaotu, then use his effect to summon Bi'an, and use Chiwen's own effect to summon himself. You can then tune Bi'an and Chiwen for Herald of the Arc Light.

- When Herald uses its effect, you can add a ritual spell or ritual monster from your deck. I run 1 Chaos Form and 1 Chaos MAX for that. If Baxia is still on the field, you can use his effect to recycle the Herald. Also, Baxia is a level 8, so if you feel like it, you can overlay him with a Blue-Eyes for a Rank 8. 

- The Predaplants are leftovers on the field. If you are so inclined, you could overlay them for Invoker, summoning Ratpier, and do usual Zoodiac shenanigans. I don't run that because it takes way too much Extra Deck Space. I used to run Leviair, because Leviair could recylce my Stones, but I had to cut it out because of space.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I'd say Blue-Eyes is far from sucky, but:

1. Summon a Dogoran and a Gameciel on opposing sides of the field. Usually done through Kaiju Slumber or Kyoutou Waterfront (I run 2, because I run Mausoleum and Ancient Fairy. Plus, Kaijus are good as an out to Master Peace, who does not live up to his name at all). If it is through the latter, do not give the opponent Gameciel. And don't give them Gadarla for the matter; its effect is quickplay.

2. Somehow get two Blue-Eyes on the field, or 2 other level 8s. The easiest way is via summoning Maiden, and then using Sage or Master on her, and chaining her own effect. 

3. Overlay your Kaiju and a Blue-Eyes for Cipher Dragon. Use Cipher Dragon to Steal your opponent's Kaiju. 

4. Overlay your remaining Blue-Eyes over the stolen Kaiju for Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy. 

5. Overlay Full Armour Photon over Cipher, use his effect to pop something if you want, then overlay Dark Matter Dragon over him. 

6. Use Dark Matter Dragon's effect to send a White Stone of Ancients, Arkbrave Dragon and Amorphage Goliath to the graveyard. 

7. In your end phase, use stone to summon a Blue-Eyes, and in your opponent's standby phase, use Arkbrave Dragon to summon Amorphage Goliath. 

You end up with a field of:
                

                Hope Harbinger Dragon, which means that your opponent must sacrifice one of their spells, they can't attack Goliath, and if they destroy Dark Matter, they have to deal with a 7k attacker.
                

                Dark Matter Dragon. A 4k double attacker. 

             
                Amorphage Goliath. If your opponent has anything with a name remotely close to "Zoo", they are dead. 
                  

                Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Our Lord and Saviour. Try using Fiendish Chain now. 

That's the basic combo. You can make variations that result in a stronger field. Using Alternative for the xyz summon will let you recycle him via the Stone you sent off Dark Matter. Using a Return of the Dragon Lords means that your field can avoid destruction once. Having Galaxy Soldier in hand, and an extra light means that you can have infinity on the field as well. If your opponent doesn't rely on the extra deck, you need to get over something big, or just want to banish a monster, you can send Divine Dragon Lord Felgrand instead of Goliath. 

You can screw your opponent even more if you can summon a 3rd Blue-Eyes, and you have Glow-Up Bulb in your hand:

Normal Summon the Glow-Up Bulb, and tune it with one of the blue-eyes for Spirit Dragon. 

Tribute the Spirit Dragon for any level 8, preferably Stardust Spark Dragon to protect something this turn. 

Use Glow-Up Bulb's revival effect, and tune the bulb with the Spark Dragon for Cloudcastle. 

Use CloudCastle to summon Spirit and overlay for True King of all Calamities. 

When you this, not only can your opponent not access their extra deck, not only can they not use a spell once per turn, they can't even use monster effects. 


Bonus points of cruelty if you are able to keep that Gameciel on your field with Kyoutou Waterfront at 5 counters.   </TEXT>

If ever they are stupid enough to flip that Secret Village up, then they can't play a single Spell, while you can play all your spells.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thing is, if I run brilliant engine, it bricks. To stop it from bricking, I run the Predaplant engine, which bricks less, because the lonefire blossoms get rid of themselves, and a dead monster is always more useful than a dead spell.

Now, if I'm running the Predaplant engine, I end up having clogged monster zones. Therefore, I run a Rank 3 xyz (Leviair, because I can recycle Stones of Ancients). Thus, a Brilliant Fusion engine takes up 2 ED spaces. I can't even spare one, so much less two.

Besides, the extra normal summon is not all that necessary to me. If I'm using the double normal summon, it's because I already spent a normal summon on Scorpio. Apart from Lv 1 Light Tuners, the only normal summonable monster I run is Galaxy Wizard, so running Mausoleum already gives me that second normal, and it gives me some graveyard setup, without using up my ED. 

Sorry if this comes off like I'm ticked off or something, because I'm not. Just explaining why I can't use Brilliant fusion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No need to apologise; I should have been clearer.

Thanks for the suggestion. This one looks very promising. Actually, I could start off with synthess in hand and miccs in grave. I just summon synthess, use its effect to banish miccs, then normal summon the tuner, get synthess in the grave, and banish it for miccs. On top of that miccs is a level 5 Machine, so he gives more targets for Infinity. On top of that, he completely replaces the brilliant fusion, except for the fact that he doesn't mill a light. 

I'll try it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the suggestion.

However, after having had a look at them, they don't seem to do much if they aren't used in a deck focused around them. I was looking for something a bit more generic.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Engine to churn out a lv 4 and lv 5? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-08 10:58:29 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hello. 

Anyone knows of engines that can churn out a lv 4 and a lv 5 in one turn, without using the normal summon (or if it does, allows me to summon a lv 1 tuner somehow), and more importantly, without using the extra deck at all (unless they are pends. Extra deck space is way, way too tight). It's important that neither of them are tuners. 

The Brilliant engine does that easily: Summon Seraph (lv 5) and from the brilliant fusion, summon Wulf/Trick Clown, but ED space is really, really, limited. Anything that could pull that off, without relying on the extra deck?

Thanks for answering.

	<TEXT> It happens to me all the time. I tend to just have random stuff pop up in my head, and sometimes that makes me smile. It also happens when I'm in a really good mood. 
I actually remember that I nearly got into trouble for it. It was the last day of the school year (or close to it; I don't go on the last day generally). 

I was in class, smiling because it was nearly the end of school and I was happy. Teacher saw my smile, and proceeded to yell at me for 10 mins straight. For smiling. She spent the remainder of the class annoyed at me. It was the last class she ever had. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SI units are useful, but when you are working in physics, there is a tendency to use more practical units. For example, if you are working in relativity, you generally wouldn't use meters and seconds, but you'd rather use units such that the speed of light is exactly 1. It is not explicit, but you are doing it anyway.

Also, there are certain sets of units, called the natural units. An example of such a set is Planck units. These units use fundamental constants of nature: the speed of light (c), the Reduced Planck constant (h'), the Boltzmann constant (k_b), the Gravitational constant (G) and the Coulomb constant(1/4e) to define the Planck length, the Planck time, the Planck charge, the Planck mass and the Planck Temperature. 

For example, the Planck length is defined as (h'G/c^3). One unit of the Planck length = 1.6 x 10^(-35) m.  </TEXT>
