	<TEXT> Because just bigger battery won't cut it for me and frankly it isn't a big enough upgrade from 3. Also the fact that it looks exactly the same. 

Edit: I asked for bigger battery because it is highly likely that OP5 will have higher resolution display. So bigger battery is needed in that case for my phone to last a day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Will Switch from my OP3 for OP5 only if the battery capacity is bigger. With a higher resolution display highly likely to be on OP5, The battery has to be larger to get good SoT. New processor would definitely help a lil though. In any case, Bigger battery and Im ready to exchange my OP3 to OP5. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sissoko in the Euros* not in EPL. I still don't believe that we spent so much for him. It was kinda obvious that he wouldn't retain that level. That was pretty much like Adebayor playing for Tim Sherwood in that one steak of games where he just kept running like a mad dog. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im just confused how fast the medic guy ran in. Its like he knew what was going on. What if he just fell coz he was dehydrated or something? Probably the player was already suffering with that condition.

Edit: Oops I didn't read the implanted part. So the medic din do nufin'? </TEXT>
