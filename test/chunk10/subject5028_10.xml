	<TEXT> Well we don't know. That's the entire point of a proper investigation. Taking events at face value and making assumptions as to what they mean isn't evidence at all. Evidence would be a recorded phone call with the Russian government in which trump talks about them meddling in the election. If you have that evidence I'd love to see it. At this point there's as much "evidence " for the trump-Russia collusion as there is for PG. Which is all conclusive and fishy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It happens. The best of the best make mistakes every now and then. We just need to get over it and move on. And we should stop calling him trash just because he made mistakes  (which he made up for later in the game by making 6 saves). People are talking about how we need to replace him. Everyone just chill out, he's fine. He even made two saves later on that could have been save of the week worthy (the one where he came off his line to win a 1 v 1 and a last second palm on a ball heading to the roof of the goal). Also if we are going to start calling people bad tonight we mustn't forget that Gil missed a easy goal scoring opportunity and the defense left Joe out to dry on the last 2 goals. This could have been a 2-1 game instead of a 4-0 game. But Jesus I've never seen people turn so quickly on someone that has been integral for a team simply because of a couple mistakes(This isn't necessarily directed at you, just something I've noticed tonight from the fanbase and mls as a whole). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mediocre saves? one of them was the defense leaving him completely out to dry with him having to make a 1 v 1 save and another was him making a great save on a ball on near post. Also goalkeeping isn't just about making the saves. He came off his line perfectly every time and created some good plays with his distribution. I think you have an unrealistic standard for a goalkeeper. Keepers make mistakes too. Not saying they should go unnoticed but besides the first near post mistake and the 2nd goal that went in he was great. </TEXT>

If we are judging National Team callups on if the person makes a mistake every once in a while then Rimando, Bingham and probably Howard are all out too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue with Hamid is that he is insanely injury prone for whatever reason. I think that alone ruins his chances. Also I think they just need to find a number 1 keeper in his mid-late 20's so they can have someone to hold down the fort for a few years while they look for the new young talent they need. I just think constantly calling up mid thirty year old keepers that are proven is stupid. Call up one old keeper that is proven and then two younger new guys. That way you have someone thats really good and then backups. Maybe even one of the new guys will end up being really good. Its hard to tell whose actually good based on club performance alone sometimes.  </TEXT>

They keep calling up the same 4-5 guys that are getting really old and then are surprised when they are left with 2 younger goalkeepers after a few years.  Try calling up bendik or Melia. Try some new people. If they suck in training then dont call them back again simple as that.  Keep cycling through until you find someone thats really good.

	<TEXT> I have to agree, they live in a very nice house in a good part of LA so obviously they arent exactly short on money. I think they should put their efforts to finding a alternative income/platform to post on rather than make videos every couple of weeks complaining about YouTube. It's their site and they can do whatever they want on it. That's what you signed up for when you became a content creator on YouTube. But Ethan and Hila can afford to keep the channel going a for a while without having a crazy good income so I think they should adjust to posting somewhere that's smaller that pays content creators better(if such a thing exists) or just move to Twitch. I don't get the whole "I'm just gonna complain and hope something changes" attitude that every single big YouTuber seems to have. If every single big YouTuber that has complained about the YouTube rules all collectively decided to up and leave the site then YouTube would take a massive hit and would have to make changes to get them back but instead they all just do nothing. I just don't get it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. Being a top quality goalkeeper is about being good, and being consistently good. If you have more than 3 or 4 bad games in a row right when you're supposed to be in your prime like he is than you are running the high risk of losing your national team spot as there are at least 4 other goalkeepers at around his age dying for a spot and showing that they have the ability to play for the USMNT. I'm sorry but I think Bingham has just played himself out of his spot. </TEXT>

It seems like he's the only keeper that gets criticized a crazy amount even after performing amazing countless times.

I'm not saying Bendik is a perfect goalie but he cant seem to have any exposure on r/MLS without getting insane levels of criticism.

	<TEXT> Thanks man! This is pretty much exactly what I was looking for. More people that felt a similar way. Not just instant downvoting because I had a different opinion. I feel like a lot of the times its hard to blast some newer 311 tracks in my car with the windows down because it just gets so cheesy when SA starts rapping.  "Too late" is the best example, it's very heavy and awesome to blast on my sound system with my windows down but then when it gets to SA's rap parts that are kinda slow, it makes me feel really cheesy for some reason. A lot of his stuff I am very okay with though and I even actually love some of his songs. But for me a lot of recent stuff from him has been a major miss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. "Running" is actually also one of my favorite songs. I love his older stuff because it was just different and felt like it belonged but now when he randomly chimes in and does a slow rap it turns me off to the song. It's just too cheesy for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats more or less what I was hitting at too. I feel like its either an element that adds a lot to a song or takes away a lot from the song. I loved "too late" until his rapping part. It felt like a real heavy song and then suddenly theres like the SA rapping part which make it seem a bit less heavy to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im not sure about that. I think his rapping sounds a lot less corny. Maybe it's because I'm an east coast guy but the higher pitched rapping doesnt sit well with me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For real. I can deal with a few months of constant product merchandising with the idea that new music will be out soon but it's been almost a year since the last music we've heard and everything he releases now is new apparel and random TTS shit. He uses his AVA social media as a product plug too which imo drives new fans away. He hasnt even talked about music at all in the past year minus the "announcement" of new music for his new movie. He also keeps hinting at announcements like the new "HUGE" project which he was supposed to announce by now. He's driving his reputation into the ground while making his old fans sick of the constant merchandise plug on all his social media while also turning new fans off to his music. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That kind of rapping has a very 90's/early 2000's feel to it. I always was fine with it on the older stuff because it worked back then for the time period. Even one of my favorite songs is "Galaxy".I just cant get on board with the high pitched rapping on the new stuff like "Too late". It's one of my favorite songs ever made until the SA rapping part. Even my friends go "yikes" when it gets to that part. I know he's part of the band it he's not going away but I'm just curious to know if anybody else feels that way too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe this is just me but I am starting to get a very fake vibe from this entire vlog season so far. I feel like he has gotten insanely hypocritical as of recently and just overall seems a bit self infatuated at times. I have also noticed how almost every vlog has some type of "well now im going to do a thing with Samsung...and here's one of their products." plug. I almost feel like he is just vlogging because Samsung told him too and he wanted to get people to like beme again. Honestly, I don't feel like he really enjoys it anymore. I feel like its all just a job for him now. That's just my opinion though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's the part that bugs me the most. He almost seems to brag about it. I mean he even named the video 'SHE SCREAMED THE ENTIRE FLIGHT". And at the end of the video he just casually says "oh yea and Francine screamed for the entire flight." Like you should be apologizing profusely and explaining that you tried everything you could to stop her. Not making it sound like your prideful that nobody around you got sleep. </TEXT>
