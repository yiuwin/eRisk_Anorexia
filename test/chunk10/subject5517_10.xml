	<TEXT> What gives the unborn the right to use another human's body? There is no other situation in which another person is allowed to use another's just because they'll die without it. One cannot be forced to give blood or organs, and those are much smaller feats than allowing a human to grow inside you and wreck your body from the inside out. 

It's unethical to force a woman to carry a fetus to term, not unethical to end a life before it becomes one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You get out of there, honey. You get out, but it still hurts for a long, long time. You'll never be the same, and the sooner you stop chasing the girl you were before it happened, the sooner the pain dulls. You've got great thigns in you, they're just different things. Yeah, you aren't sweet anymore, you don't see good in the world anymore, and you don't really love anything anymore, but you find something to live for. It's this book you're writing. Yes, you write a book. You gotta keep going so you can write out the lives of these great people you make up. It helps you a lot, too. Takes your mind off things, helps you start to care again. 

You meet a new guy, too. It hurts like hell when J leaves, but you're with someone better now. Don't miss him too much. 

Also, fight like hell to get what you need. Don't drop it, bring it up every chance you can. We haven't got it yet, but you gotta fight. 

Oh, and none of your freinds care when you come back home. Don't expect them too, it makes the pain worse. Everyone moved on, so you have to, too. 

Good luck, and you can do it. 

Also, you look *great* with purple hair in a couple years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly, I wouldn't have guessed English isn't your native language. It reads really smooth overall, and maybe more importantly, it's *interesting*. Reading it over, I want to know more. I really like your style (sentance structure, word choice, ect.) 

The only thing I really notice is a few sentances seem like run-ons. Maybe separate "My hands shaking terribly on the steering wheeel, SLAM I go on the brakes" into two senttances. 

Another thing is, occasionally, the wrong form of a word is used. "Breaks" means something is falling apart, "Brakes" are what are in a car. This is the only time it even hints that English isn't your native tongue. Hell, lots of native speaks do the same thing. 

Also, thoughts don't need quotes, just italics. 

Finally, I think you find the balance of description well. It's not too vague, nor is it over done, and the concept is fascinating. I'd love to hear more, and that's an amazing quality for writing to posess.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder the streets for a while, my rush turning to worry as I wonder if maybe she doesn't want me to find her. 

Or if she's just too damn good at hiding. 

Nonetheless, I cannot shake the image of her siren grin as she retreated into the crowd from my mind. 

By now it's begun to rain, though the sun still shines, and I find myself swiping my dripping hair out of my eyes for the hundredth time.

I stop to rest against the corner of a shop and nearly jump out of my skin when I heard the husky, low voice in my ear. 

"Hey there," she croons. 

I whirl around to find myself facing Erin once more. She hangs upside-down from the eves elegant and smiling crookedly, smugly, her eyes dancing and her hair hanging down below her. 

"What took you so long?" she asks, sliding her slender fingers across my cheek before executing a nimble flip off her perch and landing beside me. 

I find myself gaping uselessly, unsure of what to say. 

She walks a slow circle around me, trailing her fingers over my chest, my shoulders, and she smirks as she notices my racing heart. 

In an instant, she's so close I can feel the heat of her body, the way she's toned so tight. A predator. 

"Come with me, Holland." She enunciates my name in a delicious, sultry purr, the syllables rolling perfectly off her tongue. I am helpless to deny her request, and unable to find my voice. 

I nod and she takes my wrist, pulling me along. She weaves through the crowd, her narrow but shapely hips swishing with a self-assured confidence I could never hope to possess and I find myself target to a few angry looks as she shoves a few people aside. 

*I can''t control her* I want to tell them. 

I have a feeling that will become a very frequent thought for me.

I watch the hurricane of a woman break into a light run until we reach the edge of Town. She ducks easily under the fence illuminated with the faint blue glow and heads into the trees. 

I follow her into the woods, the towering evergreens nearly the same shade, but infinitely less intense, as her eyes. She quickly locates a small, incredibly clear stream (much clearer and purer looking than any of the water I've ever seen within the Town. 

Unlike many others, It *had* occurred to me to just... come out here. And I had. Many times. It is beautiful and peaceful and I have no reason to fear the Feral. I can handle myself. 

*"There is no reason to leave the Town"*

I am unsure why those words pop into my head right then, the words we are told many times over as children. 

While it is not directly among the Forbidden, it is frowned upon by the Overseers (upon the Royalle's request), and that ideology is enforced by the Feral Ones that lurk in the unoccupied spaces surrounding the Towns; the vaguely human beings who refused the comforts of the New Instatement and chose to retreat into our unused lands. 

I wonder how Erin became so comfortable in this place. 

She slows to a brisk walk after a while, taking sure, determined steps over the pebbling, grassy bank, her boot's crunching accompanying the sounds of birds and other creatures. 

We travel in silence for a while before she speaks again.

"What are you?" she asks me as she brushes aside a pine branch, ducking to avoid the needles. Some of the wild strands catch one anyway and I pluck it out. 

"I'm Holland," I remind her. "I'm among the Conicious-"

"I mean what *are* you?" she presses. 

I realize she means more than my name, more than my class.  

"I... I'm an artist," I tell her. My sketches have always been a large part of who I am. 

She smiles beautifully as she spins a circle to face me. "I'm a dancer," she tells me. I am not surprised. 

"Where are we going?" I ask. 

"You'll see," she says with a smirk as she turns and run into the trees. I hurry after her, unwilling to let her leave my sight. I watch as she elegantly leaps up onto a fallen tree, running up its length and jumping off the end, catching a branch in her fall (or more of a flight, really) and swinging onto the ground on the other side of the now much wider stream. 

I steel myself as I prepare to follow her actions, breathing even and hard as I charge up the log, catch the branch... and ove-rotate, landing humiliatingly on my ass. 

She throws her head back in that musical laugh and I smirk up at her. 

"What?" she asks. 

"You look damn fine from down here, that's what."

I swear she blushes a bit before extending her hand to me, helping me up. 

It isn't long before we arrive in a sandy, rocky clearing with a few people in strange attire milling around, a few booths selling oddities and things that are most assuredly Forbidden, and an ornately arched building sitting across from us. I feel my eyes light up as I take it in. 

It is amazing. 

Erin catches my smile and grins in return, taking my hand. 

"You haven't seen the half of it yet," she tells me before guiding me through the crowd and into the building. It looks like a library of sorts, but the books are bound in leather and contain paper. I look around as she pulls me along, trying to determine what may be hidden within the thousands of volumes on the towering shelves, but Erin takes me behind one of the shelves, dropping to her knees and drawing a small knife from her boot. 

My eyes widen as she slices the tip of her finger and begins drawing a pattern in the blood. 

A moment later, a hatch on the door slides open and she stands, facing me once more. 

"Follow me, Holland." She smiles devilishly as she holds out her arms and falls backwards into the hole.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watch the lean, tall figure dashing through the crowd, her fiery hair trailing behind her as she nimbly leaps over a crate. 

"Shit!" I swear as I force myself faster. I can't lose sight of her. She's got my whole day's earnings under her arm. 

Damn pickpockets. 

I chase after her, my breathes coming in ragged gasps. I may be in good shape but she's getting away like she's a fish in the waves.

I'm about to give up in frustration when I see my chance. 

Ha. She doesn't know her way around. 

I dash through a side street and throw myself around the corner, tackling her to the ground as she rounds it. She kicks me off and tries to run but I'm on my feet too fast. I snag her around her waist and lift her up so she can't get any traction. 

"Get off me!" She screams.

"Give me my money!"

Her elbow connects with my jaw and I drop her. I've barely righted myself when her tiny fist slams into my cheek. 

I gasp and spit out a bit of blood before reaching for her arm. I catch it and twist it up behind her back. Without missing a beat, she throws her legs off the ground and slams her feet into my abdomen. I grunt in pain and drop her. A moment later her foot hits my side and I'm on the ground. 

Another swift kick catches my ribs and I cry out as I grab her ankle and pull her to the ground. I pin her down with my legs and go to secure her wrists but she reacts too fast, throwing another punch into my face. And another. And another. 

She ends the attack with a sharp knee to my chest and throws me aside, getting up to run. 

It's as our hands brush in the scuffle that I feel it. 

They always told me that it was something you couldn't describe, but that you would know it when you feel it. 

I didn't believe them, but now... that's the only explanation. 

This is my soulmate. 

And she must feel it too. 

Her blazing green eyes meet mine as she turns back to face me, and her lush lips part slightly in a silent gasp. 

My resolve is renewed and I use all my energy to catcher by her wrist in one hand, her waist in the other. 

It's no longer about getting my money back. I cannot let her get away, not know that we are tied together by the Cosmos. 

"What's your name?" I demand as I meet her eyes. 

She looks defiant, untamable. "The fuck is it you?"

"I think you know," I whisper. 

Her eyes widen a little more and I feel her breathing get faster. 

"...Erin." she answers after a moment. 

"Holland," I give her my own name. 

She nods, her pointed chin raised. "It seems we've met an odd twist."

"Indeed."

"What are we to do now?"

"Well... first I'd like my wallet back."

She laughs, a musical, whole laugh. "You'll have to take it from me then." 

With those words, she whirls out of my grasp and takes off down the street. 

I will find her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Who the hell are you?" I demand, my hands shaking around the rope that was meant to be my demise. I was plotting how to get it up around the ceiling fan with this guy suddenly stepped out of fucking *nowhere*, seemingly materializing out of the shadow of my bookcase. 

"I'm your damnation," the tall, broad-shouldered man responded, a slight smirk gracing his face. 

I feel my eyes widen and my breaths quicken. "What are you on about? Why are you in my house?" 

"Because it's my job to make sure you never leave it again," he tells me his voice dark and low. 

My breathing comes in gasps for a moment more before they slow and calm, and I find myself laughing. 

His face turns from smug to confused. He frowns slightly and one eyebrow arches. "Just *what* is so funny to you about this?" he asks, his tone icy. 

I giggle manically a moment more before holding my hand over my mouth, quieting myself. "*I'm* supposed to be my damnation. With this." I hold up the rope for demonstration. 

He looks taken aback. "*Why?*"

"Because I'm done," I say, my eyes welling with tears. "I'm just done. I haven't felt alive since I was a kid. I started dying the day my parents did. I should have died in the crash too but some sick bastard decided I needed to see a little more pain first. A little more pain disguised as a reprieve from it. He promised to stay by my side, and he did. Oh lord, did he stay by me. Suffocatingly close to make sure I never got away, couldn't run from him. All his words, his touch, his presence, things once so passionate and loving that turned toxic, breaking me down with each strike, each jab, each look at me. Like I was a cockroach instead of his 'lover.'"" I sneer the last word. 

His face turns dark and troubled, almost imperceptibly angry. "You want to *die* because of what some shitbag did?" he seems like the idea is just so damn crazy. 

"You want to kill me because..." I was ready to retort but I realized I don't know why. 

"Because some shitbag payed me," he answers with a smile. 

I take an involuntary step back. "Your a hitman?" My voice wavers. 

He takes several quick, graceful steps forward. I glare defiantly as he hooks my chin with his fingers, guiding my face up. I resist the urge to pull my head away. 

"That's right, sweetheart," he croons. His face is so close to my ear I can *feel* the words and it sends an odd shiver of excitement through me. 

*This man is going to kill me.*

And that excites me. 

That, and his warmth, his *delicious* scent, his smoldering eyes...

"Then get it over with," I snip, raising my chin a bit. 

"Hmm..." he makes a face as he thinks. "No." 

"No?" I demand, offended. "*No?*"

"No," he clarifies again. 

"Why *not*?"

"Because you've got more living to do." There is mischief in his eyes as he looks me over. 

"Says who?" I scoff

"Says me." His tone darkens.

I find myself nodding helplessly. 

"Now..." he begins, making a gesture with his finger. "Let's destroy the fucker who took the light from your eyes."

As if in a trance, I follow the tall man out the front door, strolling out into the night with a purpose I have not felt in six months and three days. 

I am going to destroy the one who ruined me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been working on a novel that is currently twenty-nine chapters long at 139 pages. It follows a couple of characters but it's in the first-person, and who that first-person is changes frequently between them.

My question is about how I don't really have any pattern as to when I switch perspective. It usually alternates by chapter but sometimes I switch within or do a couple in a row from the same perspective. 

Will that make it choppy or interrupt the flow? </TEXT>

I've been working on it a lot lately and it's been eating away at me, wondering if it's any good. My main concern is that it's just... boring and mundane, unremarkable.

	<TEXT> I eat nothing but junk food and I'm very thin. It is not what you eat. It's how much. It really infuriates me that there are people who think an ounce of chocolate will make you fat and that a pound of veggies will magically burn fat. It's just so rediculous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Half of my choice is vanity and the other half is because I'm broken...

Sometimes I think I want a baby. Sometimes I think I want to be a stay-at-home mother. But then I remember I wouldn't be able to handle it. I spend most of my day sobbing and having flashbacks (yay sexual assault! /s). I think about how I'd be looked at and touched in intimate areas by doctors and such during hours of labor. I think about how if the child was female I'd never be able to bond with it. 

And then I also think that I love my body too much to ruin it with a baby. I don't want stretch marks, loose skin, thin hair, I don't want to gain weight. I don't want my tits getting all stretched out and saggy. 

This is why I don't know what to say when people bingo me. I don't want to tell them I am broken or that I am shallow. Because that's it. I don't have some reason like "I want to dedicate myself to charity" or "I have a genetic disorder that would hurt my baby". I just don't want my body messed up and and mind is too messed up already to handle it. It sounds pathetic. And I feel like it proves them right. That there's something wrong with being childfree. But I know there isn't. It's a valid life choice. But I don't want them to think I'm just too broken to "fulfill" my life. 

*sigh*  </TEXT>

And I know the cells get replaced by the body is essentially the same. Looks the same...feels the same. It will always be known :( 

Exercise is always counterproductive to me because it makes me too hungry. 

And the yummy food is a problem because everything I like is high calorie and k want tons of it so I have to purge...

I'm working towards it it's just not possible in a healthy way for me. That's not really the problem though, the problem is that I presently hate myself and my body isn't safe and my own.  </TEXT>

And my hair grows super slow. It's gonna be at least 3 years before it's even *ok*, at least 5 before it's pretty :(  </TEXT>

I know I can't make a wish, I just really want to not be used. It's more regret. And it's not that I'm prudish and don't like sex (that's not the case, I always wanted it, just not with some pervert who was like 15 years older than me at least and most importantly was not my partner and did it to me against my will), I just wanted to always only have one person know me in that way. Only one. For my first to be my last. I guess sickly enough that is kind of going to be true, as being violated ruined any chance of me ever being able to handle that. So I'll never get to be with anyone consensually...

It feels like it's the end of me...And it really did end my love because he left me for how I was acting over it. It ruined me and made him hate me because of what I became </TEXT>

I'm short, so I've only gained 30 pounds, but it looks like 50. Also I'm completely skinny fat so while I technically have a healthy weight I look super chubby. No thigh gap. No flat stomach. In disgusting. It's a lot of why I don't feel like me anymore.

	<TEXT> He hates me now. My lover. My best friend. My everything. 

Well...a year and a half ago I was sexually assaulted. That happened while I was in an inpatient facility for eating disorders. That's when we started to lose it. I had flashbacks and hated myself and my body. I wasn't the happy, lovely, sweet girl he fell in love with anymore. I hated the world and myself and being alive.

Soon after that I was forced to live away from home with a different relative and they turned out to be abusive...beat me, creeped on me, threw away all my things, held me down and cut my hair from my waist to my chin, and isolated me from everyone. Put me on homeschool, took away all access to phones or email or anything. I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone or leave the house.

He thought I'd killed myself. I couldn't talk to anyone during the 10 months I lived with the abusers. I just disappeared.

And in that time I feel like I lost myself. I feel like I stated dying after I was violated and then the 10 months of abuse completely killed me. 

I don't feel like me anymore. I don't act like me anymore. 

I miss myself. The pretty girl with long long hair. The innocent pure girl who had never been seen without clothes on or touched beyond hugs and brushes in crowds. The sweet girl who loves everyone and everything. I one who wants to be a nurse so she can help people. 

Now I'm angry and I hate everything. I am not beautiful. I'm not pure...my body is used. Stripped and displayed and touched all over. I can't be kind anymore. I just want to be dead. 

He broke up with me because I'm gone. The real me is gone. He told me not to talk to him until I'm me again. It was such a big fight. I needed to talk about what happened. He hates that. He told me I'm insane and belong in a mental hospital. He told me he hates me. He said everyone hates me. He said I'm crazy. 

I just want to be her again. 

I feel like death is the only thing I can do. I can't ever be happy again. I'm broken...

Neither have I. It must be the cobblestones.

The vibrations and motion caused by the cobblestones made the second nun orgasm, so when the first said that she had never come that way, meaning she had never taken that route before, the second assumed she had meant she had orgasmed as well, and attributed it to the cobblestones.

The fact that they are nuns adds to it, as nuns are celibate </TEXT>

"At least I don't get allergies", I thought, as my mind wandered to thoughts of my husband with his red, dripping nose, raw from tissues, afflicted by the season. I missed him briefly, reminding myself he would be home soon enough, in three more weeks.

Moments passed and I began to drift, feeling light and content in my empty home, dreamy as my mind began to slip, a sweet sleepy haze falling over me, quieting my mind...

My peace was interrupted by the sound of a sneeze.  </TEXT>

Do you want to get molested?". The reason I could talk to the female therapist was because I was molested by a different female.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was barely a teenager and I was forced into a mental treatment center where I was sexually assaulted by one of the psychiatrists. I entered anorexic (except not really, because I just constantly crash dieted because it was fun and it made me look good. No disordered thoughts, no low self esteem, so self hate, just an over inflated ego) and socially anxious and left suicidal and broken. It's been years and I haven't gone a day without crying, I can't even handle simple things like washing my hair or changing my clothes without breaking down sobbing, I can't have normal relationships, I couldn't finish high school at a real school because of the fear of other females I've had since the assault (things like changing for gym and all of the other things where they segregated the genders so I'd be stuck with only other girls wouldn't be possible for me after it so I couldn't go back), I have constant thoughts of ending my life even all this time later, I hate every inch of my disgusting, violated body that doesn't belong to me and it kills me everyday that the sick fuck who assaulted me knows my body in such initiate ways and that that is how I lost my purity. And the worst is that my family and everyone else thinks I'm happy and fine and that going to the hospital saved me. They don't even know and they would care anyway. I died that day, all they did was ensure my body didn't die with me, for which I will always be angry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So being afraid of women since I was sexually assaulted by one means I'm a misogynist in the eyes of tumblrina "thatsproblematic". That just...that pisses me off indefinitely. That's so rude. Because I bet a great deal that if I'd been assaulted by a man and therefore was afraid of them "thatsproblematic" would be all sympathy and understanding. Fuck that bitch. I don't think women are inferior or inherently violent because of the assault- they just for make me uneasy. I realize that unease in not rational and that just because one woman was a monster does not mean they all are. I just can't seem to trust them anymore. 

But the analogy of vispider was flawless. That's just so accurate and perfectly explained.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This legitimately makes me feel afraid for my independence, security, freedom, and safety, that there people who think like this. These people want to take every single woman alive who actually thinks rationally and turn her into a brainwashed man-hating femizombie. They want to convert us all into angry, hateful, sexist, conservative, conformists with massive victim complexes and no opinions, thoughts, or ideas of our our. They want to take away my own control and authority over my own body and mind and that is terrifying.  

They've done the exact opposite of what they were supposed to follow- they are the reason I (another woman) feels afraid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gah! Ok so I slipped into binge eating for about three weeks now and obviously put on some weight from that and I'm now trying to reclaim my body but I *love* eating so I needed support and encouragement to get past this binge urge, so I log on to a site and start chatting with the person I got matched up with and expressed my frustration and wanting to binge and feeling gross and she just kept trying to talk me out of it losing weight and not binging! Like, doesn't "body positive" mean having a positive relationship with your body? In order to do that I need to like the way it looks, and I don't like my body right now. Why did she have to get so combative about my decision? Why do people try to talk others out of losing weight?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much! 

And yeah, my parents wouldn't let me get counseling even if I told them and I can't tell them why I need it and I can't get to a large town or city on my own yet as I can't drive yet and live in a really off-the-map place way off from anywhere else but I'll be able to drive soon and probably could then. 

Thank you so much for the help and resources(: </TEXT>
