	<TEXT> London is lovely - enjoy it! For what it's worth, when I was in London a few summers ago, I was there for almost 2 weeks, walked pretty much everywhere and ate maybe 2 regular sized meals per day. At the end of 2 weeks, I was only up 3 pounds and it was really just water weight because I lost it after restricting for just a few days.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As others said - dressing well and accessorizing yourself to look older, mature and elegant. Also, getting your nails done! I get a full set with gel and it definitely helps me look and feel more mature. I try to stick to neutral nudes and pinks, occasionally getting a pastel color, to look more "adult" (I'm 23 but I'm 5"1 as well so I feel your pain). Funky designs look more juvenile IMO. Also, since it's nearly summer, having a nice pedicure (I usually go for French or nudes/pinks) makes you look like you're older, put together and like you take care of yourself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The bacon I buy is 80 cals for 2 strips which really isn't that bad, because if I cook a few egg whites with it, it's a normal looking breakfast for like 150 calories. Plus it's all fat and protein so it keeps me full and doesn't bloat me up! Most pre-cooked bacons are even lower in calories. </TEXT>

2. Horseback riding because it's really the only exercise I have the energy to do when I'm restricting.

4. I honestly don't read much but when I do, it's non-fiction (biographies specifically).

	<TEXT> Oh my god yes. All the time. Last year when I was relapsing I lived alone and it was glorious. I only had safe foods in my house, there was nothing and no one to tempt me with things, I was free to weigh myself and my food as I pleased. Ughhh. 

After I was discharged from treatment last summer, I started living with my SO (who also has an ED). I have to be extra discrete about my behaviors and it's hard to get away with certain things. It sucks because I often have thoughts "If I didn't live with her, I would have lost xx pounds by now." I have these intrusive thoughts about breaking up with her just so I can be alone and lose weight again. But yeah, living with her makes me realize how I took living alone for granted.  </TEXT>

Entitled and no self awareness, taking no accountability for their own actions and not accepting that they are doing things that are wrong. It's not right and makes their illnesses worse. And then all of the self-diagnosing irks me, too, especially by teenagers. I'm not saying that these teenagers don't have issues but a lot of things they go through are just part of being a teenager, and don't necessarily mean there is a diagnosis. 

I hope this doesn't make me sound like a bitch. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tumblr is weird. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-06 19:39:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I was on tumblr a lot from 2011 until 2015 (when I deleted). I didn't follow the pro ED or thinspo community back then very much because I had a comedy blog that was really popular with ~30k followers to keep up with. But I did check up on it on occasion since I did actively restrict and relapse and engage in ED behaviors. Less than 2 weeks ago I decided to give tumblr another go. I created a blog for aesthetics, recovery related stuffy and comedy stuff. 

But then I created a secondary blog for thinspo and ED thoughts and feels because I'm not *that* dedicated to recovery. I had no idea how active the pro ED side of tumblr grew *so* much. And it's all kinda...weird? I don't know how to describe how it makes me feel. Sweetspo? Meanspo? I've explored online pro ED communities for almost 10 years now and these terms are all so new to me and somehow don't sit well with me. And then I see all these posts saying "never skip breakfast because eating breakfast speeds up your metabolism". Maybe because I spent the last year on *Reddit's* proED, but eating breakfast is such a weird concept for me? If anything eating breakfast sets myself, and many others (on this sub) up for failure. Personally, I'm better off fasting as long as I can and not eating until like 3pm or so. Even eating a piece of fruit or something for breakfast would ruin my whole day because it makes my hunger cues come back. Putting off eating does cause hunger, yeah, but it's more tolerable and the hunger cues come and go.

IDK the tumblr ED community just seems foreign to me. I guess maybe because it's a lot of teenagers who use it, the ED "advice" there is just so misinformed because these are teens who are uneducated about nutrition. There are also popular ED blogs with thousands of followers and the people who run those blogs give out the WORST nutritional advice. I mean, obviously any advice that encourages ED behaviors, but shit like that would get down voted to hell on this sub. 

Anyways, I just needed to rant. I'm just going to try to ignore all the crappy ED stuff on tumblr. </TEXT>

Although I'm almost certain when I went back on Prozac last year, it surpassed my appetite for the first two weeks. But I was already restricting a lot by that point so maybe my hunger cues were already gone. Regarding antipsychotics, literally everyone I know has gained weight on antipsychotics.

I can't really comment on weight because there were people who were bulimic of normal weight, anorexics who were underweight, atypical anorexics who were barely underweight/still normal weight, etc. But it was weird.

	<TEXT> Have people here found that they were better able to control themselves once they moved out of home?

Yes. 

Last year I relapsed so hard because it was the first time in my life I wasn't living with my parents or an SO, or had *any* sort of SO/love interest in my life. I was totally on my own. That made it **so** much easier to not eat. I remember having a full 30 day period of restricting. The only time I couldn't restrict was when my mom visited, when I went on a vacation with her and her fianc, and when I had a competition weekend. And once when I bit the bullet and decided to have dinner with my friends. 

Now that I have an SO again and am living with them, I almost regret being in a relationship. 

~cue nervous laughing that turns into crying~

I was depressed and lonely last year when I was restricting. But I'm still depressed now and at least then I was getting skinny with no interruption. I took for granted how nice it was to buy "rexic foods" (as my SO calls them) and to only have those foods in my fridge in pantry. It's hard living with your SO, having to eat certain foods when they want to eat it. Having to fucking cook spaghetti for them while you're sitting there eating egg whites and a low carb tortilla. Ugh. I can't even body check without my SO saying "can u not". It doesn't help that she also has an ED. And then last night she suggested we go to Sonic for ice cream slushes. Luckily she forgot about her "date" idea. 

The only thing I can say is that if someone invites you out to do something, and that something involves food, try your best to go. I know how hard it is to eat at a restaurant or eat anything that doesn't have the calories listed. But for your own sanity, get out of the house a few times a month and be social and try to eat. When I relapsed last year, I didn't see my friends at ALL because I didn't want to eat and it just made things worse.

	<TEXT> When I was relapsing last year, I fasted every Monday, allowed 300 calories on inactive days and 500 calories on active days (horse riding). So, on average, I was eating 370 calories a day. I was typically losing 3.5 pounds per week doing this. Sometimes a pound or so more if I did an extra fasting day or ate closer to 300 on an active day. Being short sucks. A month or so into restricting back then, I was fine eating closer to 350 every day. The most I ever ate back then was like 700 calories and that was because I had ridden 3 horses that day.

Now I just try to stay under 500 calories regardless of my activity level for the day. I'm heavier now so the energy balance is probably the same.  </TEXT>

My insurance cut me off as soon as I was at a weight which they deemed healthy, which only took like 3 weeks to reach. 6 weeks into treatment and they cut me off for good. This meant I didn't get to finish the program and I really needed a LOT more help. I *really* wanted to recover, but my insurance cutting me off because I was "healthy enough" was such a turn off. I felt like such a failure. I honestly just want to be sick enough and thin enough to be able to spend enough time in treatment to actually recover. Sigh.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, it's because when I'm thin, it's one less thing to worry about. When I'm restricting, I find that I have a lot more time on my hands because I'm not eating and I'm not socializing. That gives me more time to experiment with my hair and make up so it compliments my shrinking body. If my hair and makeup are on point, and I'm thin, then whenever someone spontaneously asks me to do something with them, I can throw whatever on and *still* look good. I won't look like a fat slob. I can fully enjoy whatever activity it is, knowing I look good doing it and not worrying about my appearance. Whether it's grocery shopping alone or going to a party. I feel confident and comfortable. Even if my hair and makeup aren't done that day, I know I'll still look decent because my body looks good in whatever I'm wearing.

Another part of it is that I'm *horrible* at expressing my emotions. So I show my emotions with my body. If I'm going through something, my small body, extreme weight loss and lack of eating show people that I'm not okay. For me, it's easier to show that physically than with words.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Weighing myself is definitely one of those doors. Once I start weighing myself, my whole life becomes about calories and the number on the scale. If I'm not weighing myself, yeah, I restrict and count calories, but it isn't *as* obsessive because I know that as long I'm at a deficit, I *will* lose. And since my SO is only going to weigh me once a week, I'm not going to obsess about calories as much since I'm not looking at my weight on a daily difference - if that makes sense. 

Thank you so much for your reply. It was really helpful! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once you start feeding your body the food it needs, your hunger cues come back. For me, it takes about a month of pretty consistent restriction for the huger cues to go away. I'm sure if you repeat what you did initially, you'd be able to get rid of the hunger cues again. And starting higher and gradually reducing your calories will help, too. I typically start at 700 and eventually 300-400 is enough.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel ya, I can be the same way sometimes. What helps me is set goals, but like, *beyond* realistic goals. Say I'm averaging @ 500 calories a day, I set my goal to be 10 pounds gone in one month. I'd definitely lose that and then some. That way I still feel like I'm working towards a goal, even though it's setting the bar kinda low.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been complaining to my SO a lot lately how I hate my body, want to fit into my dresses I bought when I was underweight before I went to treatment last year, etc. She also has an ED fyi. Anyways, she said she would support me in my weight loss goals as long as I didn't go below a certain number (118) and didn't eat less than 1000 calories a day....

So she weighed me yesterday and said "it's really not anywhere near as bad as you think" and that I could probably get down to 118-120 in a month. I honestly don't know what this means for me because she has such little knowledge about how calories work, TDEE, etc. Also she is almost half a foot taller than me so what may work for her might not be applicable for me. 

We have a scale at home and, as much as I want to know the number, I'm too scared to weigh myself even if I'm home alone (which I am right now). If I had to guess I'd say maybe I'm 135? Great. That's where I started when I relapsed last year and by this time last year, I was in the lower 120's. 

Anyways, there's now way in hell I'm going to eat max 1000 calories, nor am I going to weight 118 at the least. The most I ever eat when I'm restricting is 500. Maybe 700 if I was more active than usual. And at 118 I don't look nearly skinny enough. I need to be under 110 to be happy. Ugh. I feel like I've fucked it all up my letting her weigh me.  

Sigh. There's really no point to this post. Other than the fact I'm more motivated than ever to lose weight.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, keto ;) I never thought keto would be possible with low cal restriction but I intermittently fast most days so I have a small meal sometime in the afternoon and the last time I eat will be around 6pm or 7pm, so I don't go to bed too hungry. Plus keto is filling, so even though fats are calorie dense, I don't actually use enough to break my calorie goal for the day. I hate feeling hungry - I'd much rather be tired and lethargic than a hangry bitch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I make these relatively low-cal low-carb breakfast burritos and I've been eating them every morning since Saturday and they're just amazing. 

The tortilla is low carb and pretty large. It's 90 calories and only has 6g net carbs. These tortillas actually taste so good and don't taste like cardboard like most other low-carb tortillas/wraps do. Then I scramble 1 egg+2 egg whites. I also add 2 strips of bacon. It comes to 274 calories and fills me up for like 5 hours. 

I could eat this every day and even if I weren't restricting, I'd probably still eat it. Although I'd probably use 2 eggs instead of 1+2 egg whites because the texture of scrambled egg whites can be off putting after a while.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  if you restrict heavily and longer term, it will get to a point where even eating primarily carbs within your too-low calorie limit wont help much and you'll need to increase calories to feel better

Exactly this. When I restrict I try to eat protein and fats the most, honestly. Eggs, string cheese, yoghurt, protein shakes, etc. That way when I *really* need the energy, carbs are amazingly effective.

	<TEXT> Yep this was me last night. I was so tired because I only got 4 hours of sleep the night before (which wasn't from restricting, I just couldn't sleep) but couldn't sleep. I restricted to 410 calories yesterday and I exercised for an hour and a half. I could not sleep for a few hours and then I woke up like 3 hours later than I intended to. In my experience it goes away after a couple of weeks. And then after a month or so of consistent restriction, my hunger cues have gone away all together. It also depends on your hydration levels. I've been pretty dehydrated lately (drinking water while restricting makes me really nauseous), but whenever I do push myself to get in eat least 90 oz in a day, I find that I'm able to sleep better. </TEXT>

In the grand scheme of things, 1 meal isn't *that* bad. I mean, if you fast all day and make smart choices at your meal with friends, you won't necessarily have to go over 800 calories. 800 calories for a day is still a deficit and you'll still lose weight. If you see the scale go up the next day, it's probably just sodium/water retention. These days if I have to go out with friends or my SO to eat, I make sure my meal with them is all I eat that day and that I get at least 30 minutes of exercise beforehand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My girlfriend and I are in a good place again (yay!) so we went shopping. I have a horse riding competition next week and because I've gained hella weight after going to treatment, I needed some new show clothes. Anyways, I bought a pair of breeches that are 2 sizes bigger than I'd normally wear. Then I went to try some shirts. I first tried on a size large because, well, my thighs are bigger so duh my shirt size will be bigger, too, right? NOPE. The large looked ridiculous on me. 

While I cried in the fitting room, my girlfriend went to find me other shirts to try on. She came back with a bunch of shirts in XXS. I wanted to kill her. If a size large made me look fat, then why would an XXS make me feel or look any better? Well, somehow the XXS looks way better on me and *actually* fits me well. It's just so fucking annoying how much my thighs carry most of my weight. I hate it. 

Even when I was underweight prior to going to treatment I didn't have a thigh gap - just a keyhole gap. My upper body would look emaciated while my thighs looked so big. Ugh if I'm going to be fat, can I at least look proportionate and not ridiculous? Please.

	<TEXT> Some of you may not remember me since I haven't been posting on this sub as frequently since I got out of treatment for my ED in the summer. But I've posted before about my live-in girlfriend who also has an eating disorder. 

I've had small periods of restriction since getting out of treatment and it would always hurt my girlfriend's feelings when I did. So I would stop. But for the past month or so I've been trying to lose weight the "healthy way" to appease my girlfriend. I've been eating probably 800-1200 calories on any given day and getting exercise 5 out of 7 days a week. I don't weigh myself but my clothes are a little looser. Would I love to go back to restricting to lose weight and be bony and feel happy and in control of my life? Sure. But my girlfriend doesn't allow it. 

She's unhappy with her weight and ignores all my attempts to help her lose weight in a healthy manner, as *I've* been doing for the sake of our relationship. But she doesn't want to. She doesn't want slow weight loss. She wants to lose "40 pounds in 40 days" (let's be real, even with restriction that wouldn't happen unless she was morbidly obese, which she isn't). So, as of today, she's stopped eating. She's had a few grapes and like 3 pickles. 

This is a big slap in the face to me. What a hypocrite. I can't get myself to break up with her but I guess *both* of us restricting is going to lead to that. So basically, I should care about our relationship and not restrict, but for some reason she's allowed to restrict, not give a shit about our relationship, not care about my recovery and expect me not to restrict AND stay in this relationship?

I'm so angry and I'm so hurt and I know what I'm doing is so passive aggressive but I can't help but feel betrayed and invalidated. 

Sigh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Late to this post and I don't have a drug addiction or substance abuse problem but when I was in treatment, I met a LOT of women who had the two. For them, if they weren't doing drugs or if they were clean, they'd engage in their eating disorder. A lot of them were bulimics and/or binge eaters. And if they weren't engaging in their eating disorder, they were doing drugs. A lot of the time they would go to ED treatment and then drug rehab, or drug rehab followed by ED. A lot of them didn't know they had an ED until they went to drug rehab and were ultimately sent to ED treatment from the rehab. I noticed when they were in ED treatment, they were more dedicated to their drug rehabilitation than they were to their eating disorder rehabilitation. 

This is all anecdotal and again, I don't have a substance abuse problem so take it with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not restricting like I used to before I went to treatment, but I loved my rules from back then and miss it so much:

 Wake up, use the toilet (pee and pass a BM if possible), strip naked and weigh myself. 

 If my weight is higher or the same as the day before, I coffee fast all day/as many days as it takes for my weight to drop (usually 1 day of coffee fasting is enough and I'm allowed as much coffee as I want with a splash of creamer and a packet or two of stevia per cup)

 If my weight hasn't stalled nor is it higher and I'm INACTIVE for the day, I fast until 3pm or so and limit to 300 calories

 Whether I'm inactive or not, I stop eating at around 6pm or 7pm (I don't remember tbh)

 Cut off all liquids at 8pm, my last liquid would be some Sparkling Ice Water with a serving of Miralax and also taking a diuretic pill

 On active days, I'm allowed 500 calories but try to stay at/under 400

 I body check after every shower, and I shower at night even if I've already showered in the morning in order to pass time and do another body check

 Every Monday is a coffee fast day

 No liquid calories besides coffee </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had to gain 10 pounds while I was in treatment. 4-6 weeks after being discharged, I weighed myself and was 9 pounds heavier than I was when I left treatment - I'm sure a few of those pounds was water/food from the day weight. Plus I was fully clothed. That was at the end of August/early September. 

I know I've gained probably at least 15 pounds since then. Actually, I have no idea. I feel like I haven't been as heavy a I currently am in *years*. I don't know what to expect when I get on the scale but I know whatever the number is, I will have a mental breakdown. 

If I could restrict without weighing myself, I totally would. But I need to weigh myself because I'm obsessed with numbers and seeing the number go down will show me I *am* making progress even if I can't see/feel it on my body. 

What can I do to help reduce the emotional turmoil of getting on the scale? I feel like such garbage. I know for sure I'm going to fast for at least a day before I weigh myself to get rid of some water weight. But emotionally, is there anything else I can do to make this a less painful experience?

**Edit**: Thank you all for your suggestions! I still haven't weighed myself - still mentally preparing myself. This weight is temporary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's happened to me this past week with restricting after eating like a cow for the past ~6 months. I think it just takes some getting used to - our bodies aren't used to our blood sugar being so low and our blood sugar dropping pretty rapidly. The more you do it, the easier it gets. The month or so before I went to treatment last summer, I didn't even have hunger cues despite eating 0-300 calories a day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always found coffee to be way better at surpassing my appetite and keeping me "full" compared to diet soda and/or water. Just be careful of the coffee poops...they are pretty gross and very frequent because you're having a BM with no food in your system. But I guess the benefit of them is that you flush pretty much everything out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't been weighing myself since being discharged from treatment but before I went to treatment, I was losing a pretty linear 3-3.5 pounds per week after the flush of water weight I lost from the first 1-2 weeks of initial restricting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually say "just eating less and moving more!" with a fake giggle and it makes people shut up pretty quickly. Once a friend who is an older woman said "Why are you doing this? Are you depressed?" Maybe because of her age/wisdom she could see beyond the surface. But every time people would ask about my weight loss, I really just wanted to say "I'm dying please help me." . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm late to posting but

When I was relapsing last year and my weight would stall (even for just one day) despite restricting and weighing and measuring food meticulously, I would coffee fast for 24-36 hours. So I would have up to 5 cups of coffee with Stevia and a few tablespoons of low cal creamer in each cup and the next morning the scale would budge. Maybe try that if you're comfortable with a fast? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I...don't know. I mean, my therapist would never condone me eating 600 calories a day, or diet in any way even if it were done healthily and normally. I'm 23 and have had my ED since I was 13/14. In the past, I've always been able to stop and eat normally. But this time last year is when my most recent relapse happened and I ended up in residential treatment because I could not stop on my own. I'm just hoping it doesn't end that way again. </TEXT>
