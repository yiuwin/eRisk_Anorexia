	<TITLE> Tracy Morgan's Netflix stand-up special: Staying Alive </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-19 10:02:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Tracy Morgan's new standup special is one of the better written stand-up specials I've seen. For the most part, his delivery is on point. It seems that the traumatic event he experienced (getting hit by a Wal-mart truck on the highway) has added more insight and depth to his life, which has transferred over to his sets. He hasn't removed the crude jokes--we wouldn't want him to--but he has replaced some of them with jokes that have more soul and heart. He's not only back, he's better than ever. Watch his Netflix special! It'll get the taste of Nye out of your mouth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing pedantic about what you said--certainly not from my point of view, considering that you basically described me. I can only see people like me in the authors and musicians I enjoy. My wife, though I am lucky to have met her, is so foreign from my constitution that it's as if she were a different species. 

The one thing that gives me solace, as it may give you as well, is that we have an ability to not only connect with people in the past but to feel intensly passionate about it. When I read my heroes (Joseph Heller, Osamu Dazai, Kurt Vonnegut, Nabokov, Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Proust, and so on) I get so excited about the deep connection I feel that I want to tell everyone I see. The sadness kicks in when I realize no one cares to hear about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am only happy when I am addicted to something, and yes, being a misanthrope contributes to it. Usually my addictions are innocuous: reading, writing, playing music, and so on; however, I've certainly abused illicit drugs. For about half a year it was heroin. Luckily I was able to quit that on my own, cold turkey. I still smoke weed every day. If I wasn't doing that, I'd exchange it for some kind of anti-depressant. Since I don't believe in free will or much of mainstream psychology, I don't see how that is much of a benefit over smoking weed. Both alter what chemicals are introduced to your brain at a given time and ultimately change mood. With weed I am able to control the effects far more and still feel like myself, only happier.

 Like you said, we are more apt to be nihilist, but I don't necessarily see the problem with that. For me to believe in the institutions that the common lot puts stock into, I would have to believe the common lot was special. With our tribal-animal brains that's just not the case. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Epistle to the Spursians. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-18 14:28:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The measure of who we are is how we react when something doesnt go our way.

My dear Spursians, its been an amazing season--augmented by spending it with you guys on the sub and on discord--but before I make this sound like a eulogy or a season re-cap, let me halt the record. Its not over. I refuse to believe that the Spurs will roll over and die, not historically, nor this specific roster, and so we as fans should respond accordingly.
 
While the Warriors must play the next two games on our court, I dont want to hear anything about future roster additions or fatalist notions. This team, without Kawhi, is the team that came out and thumped the Rockets in Houston to end the series. This is the team that bounced back without their point guard, the second leading scorer in the playoffs, a legend none the less. How many people thought we would be this impressive in the playoffs? Without Aldridge playing to his potential--likely due to an undisclosed injury that has been alluded to by Pop. Without Kawhi for stretches. Lets face it, weve looked like this during the regular season only to crush teams like the Cavs and Warriors. We were poised to hand the latter another one of those beatings in game one, not just because of Kawhi. It has always been a team effort with the Spurs. And somehow, as if the past hasnt taught the world, let alone us fans, the Spurs are underdogs. *Colossal underdogs.* 


If you, like me, poured countless hours and passion on this team, why would you give up on them now? Our guys are the same. The Warriors have the skill, but do we really think they have more heart than our guys? No way. Is it cognitive dissonance? Perhaps, but the lines are blurred enough, and the stakes for us as fans low enough, that having faith in our Spurs is imperative. I adopt the Spurs ideology to the nth degree. I wont wish injuries on the other team; I dont want the easy way out; Ill believe we will win until the end; And when we win, Ill be humble. Go Spurs Go.

	<TEXT> Warriors fans support for Zaza is 100%, entirely, virtually identical in size and scope to German blind support for Hitler and the Nazis. With that being said, no one should ever threaten his family or kids. Spurs fans, from experience at games and on the Spurs sub, can be as stupid and obnoxious as anyone. I haven't seen, or come across comments on the sub saying things as terrible as the things you listed. Comments like take an irrational, disturbed mind. Those kind of people transcend sports in general and are found in every group. They are best ostracized from the groups when they insist on saying things like you listed. People like me will do that. If you show me where it's happened on the sub, I'd be interested.

Edit: and I hope the sarcasm in the first sentence is obvious. I don't think Zaza intentionally tried to injure Kawhi, so I don't think Warriors fans are responding irrationally. I mean, I was a Bruce Bowen fan for pretty much my whole childhood. I don't think either guy ever wanted to hurt the other teams player. </TEXT>

As a rule, one that I reluctantly adhere to, when a player closes out on Kawhi Leonard, it's dirty. When that player so happens to be Zaza, who we can agree, since we are not biased, probably has dead bodies in his basement, it's objectively the dirtiest thing that can occur in basketball.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fights in each division with two ranked opponents fighting each other:


* Heavyweight has four  

* Light Heavyweight has five
* Middleweight has one 
* Welterweight has three 
* Lightweight has one 
* Featherweight has three 


* Bantamweight has two  



* Flyweight has one
* Women's Bantamweight has two 
* Women's Strawweight has four 

It's a shame that Middleweight and Lightweight, likely as a response to uncertainty with the champion and number one contender, has only one fight scheduled with two ranked opponents facing each other. Lightweight has consistently been a deep division with a lot of talent at the top, so the stagnation is disappointing.

The problem with the flood, other than the logistics of creating a vessel that housed that many animals, and then the inability for many of those animals to cross oceans and repopulate in their natural habitats, is that there is a breadth of proof that life never started back over. Their opinion is so asinine and unfounded that it's not even worth entertaining. They clearly didn't do any research. There is actually two flood stories pasted together in Genesis. If they did research, they would know that. Two disparate timelines are given within the same narrative. The flood story, as it is handed down to us, is remarkably similar to the one mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh. I suggest you have them read that. Nearly every religion formed around a large body of water has a story of a deluge. It is far more likely that iron age nomad borrowed elements from other tribes' stories and crafted their own than a flood occurred that flies in the face of all the scientific information we have. There is no reason to prefer to Jewish flood story to the Hindu, Mesopotamian, and various other flood stories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's break this down for you. 

Hypocrisy - a pretense of having a virtuous character, moral or religious beliefs or principles, etc., that one does not really possess.

http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hypocrisy

You're one to talk - something that you say when someone criticizes another person for doing something that they do themselves

http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/You%27re+a+fine+one+to+talk!

Akin - essentially similar, related, or compatible 

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/akin

Pointing out someone's *hypocrisy* is not a strawman. If you go on a rant about how holy the Spurs and their fans are, it's a completely valid point to remind you that your franchise and your fanbase once supported a straight up dirty player. 

Where's the strawman? Do I need to help you through this more?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You phrased my argument in your own words. You are bringing an entirely disparate issue to attack the hypocrisy of the person making the argument, not the argument and what was said itself. It's akin to saying, "well you're one to talk." It's childish and doesn't approach anything remotely close to logic. If Bruce Bowen did any of the things I talked about, you might have a point. If you're going to ignore my points and talk about undercutting players and being too physical/dirty, respond to a comment that's talking about that. Logical arguments respond to points that people make. The fact that you're talking about a single player who retired 8 years ago and that hardly anyone left playing on the team played with (pretty much just Manu at this point) shows how little substance you actually have behind your argument. For all you know, you could be responding to someone who wasn't even a fan of the team when Bruce played. Get that weak shit out of here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have a point? This is news to me. Every team has blindly loyal fans that exhibit levels of cognitive dissonance. In fact, every country has citizens largely composed of those kind of people. It's kind of how the human brain works. Did you watch the game? Did you see how obnoxious the Warriors fans at Oracle were? Did they not exhibit levels of cognitive dissonance? It's a sport, and we are fans. The stakes are so low for us that passionate and emotional responses are not nearly as egregious as you try to make them, especially considering the fact that it happens with every major sports franchise. When you get a point that doesn't amount to you being an troll/imbecile, then we'll welcoming it here. Until then, fuck off. 

Edit: What's more, there's definitely a spirit of parody and fun in my post. I don't take myself nearly as seriously as you apparently did. I think OP was having a little fun with hyperbole too.  </TEXT>

Maybe you should google it, because that's exactly what you did.

	<TEXT> The whole ankle thing seems to amount to pain and pain management. People keep saying things like, "Kawhi sprained his ankle for the third time." I really don't think he tore or strained any extra ligaments in his ankle; he simply aggravated a preexisting injury. If he can't play through the pain, he needs to sit. In terms of how the ankle effected him physically, I don't think it really did or will in the future. He was getting pretty great lift the whole game, including some impressive dunks. The reason I say that he shouldn't be effected physically in the future is due to my personal experience with ankle sprains. I've sprained my ankle five times with varying levels of severity. Three of the sprains happened while I was playing basketball. In the game that I continued to play in, mobility was not an issue. If pain was ignored, I felt like I could move virtually as well as I normally do. In cases where the sprain was more severe my movement was hampered because of my response to the pain I was feeling. When you are thinking--something pain causes you to do--you move slower, naturally. Couple that tendency with fear of stepping in a way that will cause further pain and injury and you have mobility issues, which was ultimately why Kawhi did not come back in game 5 against the Rockets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a battle between two very different types of life philosophies. One team believes it's appropriate to stand over your opponent and taunt him while he's on the ground, another believes in being humble in victory and defeat. Little kids absolutely do look up to NBA players and mimic their behavior. I may be bias, but I don't think it's hard to tell who's the good guys. You can teach respect, or you can teach how to take the easy way out and how to be an obnoxious competitor. This is for the soul of Humanity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your support for your view is one example of an entirely different fighter that didn't make weight the second time, which contradicts this statement: 

If TJ comes down and makes weight(without looking like death) and beats a top opponent then fine make the fight.

Your saying he should do exactly what the person that is evidence for why TJ shouldn't get the title shot did (as long as he doesn't look like the subjective death you referenced). In my opinion (again, subjective), [Pettis](http://i.imgur.com/TPeV2Zk.jpg) did not look worse than Mcgregor does at 145. There was some reason to think he would make the weight for the interim title fight (though you have factor in the extra pound). 

Your definition of logic/solid reasoning seems a bit different from mine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's solid reasoning for a champ to turn down a fight in his weight class because his opponent might not make the weight, or defend the belt after he beats him? How is that solid reasoning? If he puts in a pullout clause, there is no way that reasoning makes sense. In fact, you could say that about literally every opponent DJ would face. Well, they *might* not make the weight or defend the title... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This doesn't update quickly enough for me. I've read three books since this last went up and I posted that I was reading **Picture This**, by Joseph Heller. 

I finished a **Handmaid's Tale**, by Margaret Atwood. (possible spoilers!) It's an entertaining story with a fairly poor ending/prologue. The narration has a tendency to get annoying. I see little excuse to spend a paragraph telling me what happened only to say, "JK, this is what really happened." In parts, it will actually do that three times before recounting a more accurate telling of the story. The writing is simple. I'd say it's at a 6th grade reading level. Atwood seems to hold back in her attack against fundamentalist Christianity. Perhaps  the prologue, which includes a speech a couple of centuries in the future about the discovery of the *Handmaid's Tale*,  is meant to be a ironic, doubling as a commentary on the ultra-liberalism we encounter for the sake of inclusiveness, though I tend to think it's Atwood's attempt at sanitizing her polemic against fundamentalist Christianity. In the event that a Gilead regime takes over the United States, I would hope that in a future where they have disposed of the totalitarian regime scholars would not be stating, "we can't say their ways are wrong simply because they are not our ways." Overall, the book was far closer to the YA fiction that floats to the top of the New York Times best seller list than a classic novel. The show is far more bold.

I'm 300 pages into **Ulysses**. I don't have much to say about it. It's a struggle most of the time, kind of like getting your wisdom teeth pulled without an anesthetic. It's going to be a drag for a few weeks but you'll eventually feel better for having had the procedure done.

**Pnin**, by Vladimir Nabokov was the best book I've read recently. No one writes the pathetic cuckold better than Nabokov. I'll add more on this book later, after I allow it settle somewhere in my consciousness, fully formed, as an opinion (*Pnin Opinions*).

	<TEXT> Draymond is upset because he thinks something he said was taken out of context to chase a headline, but when you read what he actually said, there's not much for him to be upset about. He said when he watches the Cavs, only one team is playing good basketball. Let's think this through: If only one team is playing good basketball--the Cavs--then the other teams are all playing bad basketball against the Cavs. If the Cavs are only playing teams who are playing bad basketball, they are not playing anyone playing good basketball. If they are not playing anyone playing good basketball, they are not playing anyone good or who is actively good at that time. Draymond is saying that the Cavs are not playing teams playing good basketball. He is essentially saying they are not playing anyone good. What is he upset about? This is not out of context. The whole premise for his rant seems a bit skewed to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man, if you're searching through what people say on reddit to find logical fallacies, you've got be a fun person to be around. You do realize that /u/Komaeiki was poking fun at the irony of the situation in that last paragraph, not setting up an argument. You simply can't assume people are setting up a logical case piece by piece on an internet forum that will meet up to high academic standards. A lot of what people say on here amounts to jokes and musings. And as for the word 'irony', it's used any time an event occurs that is the opposite of one's expectations. In the above, /u/Komaeiki would normally assume that people would not protect someone who assassinates characters from a "character assassination." It is ironic; however, in reference to r/nba, it's probably not (and that may be the only small flaw in how he used the word in that sentence). 

In the case of Woj: you have a litany of circumstantial evidence in the article above that can be checked. People routinely hold opinions that are sound without the amount of evidence you require. In fact, the amount of evidence you require is not readily available on both sides. Being agnostic about the issue insures that you are incorrect, so there is simply nothing wrong with having an opinion. In light of the evidence listed in the article, it is fair to believe the allegations, though perhaps a fair level of skepticism is in order in a case with so little concrete facts and information on each side. </TEXT>
