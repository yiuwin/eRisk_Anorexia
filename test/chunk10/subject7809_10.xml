	<TEXT> What you're suggesting is kinda vague, but I think I get what you mean. My English teacher used examples to show us that successful essays usually have two things: A) a theme B) a certain idea to emphasize that theme.

Can you trace your curiosity back to a specific event and make that event relevant to the rest of your essay and decently meaningful? Then go ahead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently stumbled on this event while reading History of the World by JM Roberts, and wondered about the more in-depth details.. like tactics and regional history mainly. It was 7 years, and in Constantinople, I think 1391. I want to say Seljuk Turks. And I couldn't find it on Wikipedia when I looked in the 1391 page.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> New dark souls 3 alien lore theory (please review and give feedback) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I was thinking about DS3 can be interpreted in a kind of sci-fi way, because I was interested how it explains game mechanics by subscribing to the parallel universe theory, and the soap stones provide a Rick and Morty-esque way to explore parallel universes. Not even mentioning how Gwyndolin has tentacles (like a possible alien) or Seath's magic/genetic engineering legacy. Or any "magic" spell has to be cast with a endowed catalyst.

      My theory is that Solaire/Nameless King is an alien world hopper whose scheming brought the Chosen Undead to fight Gwyn  and whose kingmaking brought about the mutated mess of DS3. First I'll explain how this would affect and then why, and since I just spent probably 20 solid hours on the game in the past 48 I might ramble so I'll put a tl;dr.
tl;dr: the world of giants and people, Gwyn becomes a figurehead and renews the flame because of the subjugation of an alien lord. An age later, he disguises as Solaire to encourage the chosen undead to fight Gwyn.
I think that it possible to say that pyromancy and the furtive pygmy are the only true examples of magic in the game. The magic of fire that makes humanity and bonfires is sustained by the life of the flame and can grant eternal youth as long as the flame is alive, a quality exploited by Gwen. However, Gwen only had his family and no other family, they only fought the dragons and exploited men to rule over. Gwyn the giant makes an elusive city for men (the lower parts of Anor Londo) with his elaborate homestead on top (Anor Londo, Duke's Archives). Then, the alien overlord (let's call him Solaire arrives) by use of the soapstone. He poses as Solaire, appears before Gwyn, cowes him, and sets himself up as the legitimate (but masked heir) of Gwyn. Gwyn's four knights are four Solaire loyal fighters collected from multiple universes (they are aliens, notice how they all have animal faces and canonically aren't unmasked). Gwyn has a child with an alien to inherit the throne, but it turns out to be Gwyndolin. Seath (the only being in Anor Londo from the original world) and the Four Kings are taught technology in exchange for understanding of the humanity/fire magic. Seath prefers technology, but eventually side effects of experiments drive both Seath and the Four Kings insane and they wreak havoc on their subjects. These side effects weaken the power of the bonfires, and the fire begins to fade and threaten the immortality of its beneficiaries Gwen, his family, Solaire, and the 4 knights. Solaire forces Gwen to seek out the first flame, and after a beaten back attempt into Lost Izalith, Gwen is forced to rekindle the first flame by Gwen.
When the age comes to an end, and there is no solvable cure for the ailment of the first flame (its now inevitable fading due to meddling with magic) Solaire needs to find a new somebody to rekindle the flame so he doesn't have to sacrifice himself. He tries to defeat Gwen to make this easier, but the fire strengthened Gwen is too strong for him. Ornstein and Smough turn against him. They bar up Seath and try to hunt down Gwyndolin, prefering to make Gwen the new figurehead. Gwyndolin kills Gwen, makes an illusion of her to placate Ornstein (alien) and Smough (traitor giant) while he bides his time. This is where Solaire takes the false story of being the lost knight, demands the mortal man Andre's favour by granting him immortality. He guides (and through Andre helps improve) the chosen undead into the quest. He uses his bureaucrats Frampt and Kaathe, but Kaathe turns rogue, steals the soapstone ability to create his own army of conquerors out of men, which is who makes sure the white stone and the red eye orbs are early available. Confident in Frampt's loyalty and ability and the Chosen's willingness and ability after the Lordvessel is recovered he turns to learning what is left unknown of the witches of Izalith and fakes his death when the Chosen Undead stumbles upon him. In this timeline, the Chosen Undead follows Kaathe, ushers in the age of darkness. Solaire exits the universe, his plan being foiled, and the chosen undead dies a mortal death being Kaathe's pawn.

I'll explain more later, but I think that DS2 is a parallel universe because it doesn't have the men offered immortality by Solaire; Patches and Andre.

Solaire arrives in the ancient Lothric area with his enoturage of the firekeeper, the haindmaiden, Andre, Patches, and an onion knight (not siegmayer, but its a large order that all may have the same accent). With this he begins his usual line of kingmaking, his pyro/ and (technology) sorcerery/and faith abilities have made him very powerful, his ability to make enchanted rings to increase and diversify his abilities make him unstoppable. However, his experiments and work turn on him. He takes three natives in an attempt to mutate them to make them his complete and very powerful subjects, and set them up as kingmakers (using ALdrich to renew the flame lead the church, and twin princes to lead the government) but once again, giving up immortality is too great a sacrifice for all of them. Aldrich and Twin Princes turn against Solaire, who has now taken to dressing like Gwyn as the Nameless King. He is cast out, the remaining powers divide up the territory of the denigrating kingdoms. The Nameless King in a cold war against Aldrich and the Twin Princes is unable to move around much, but nonetheless hopes to bring a warrior who can beat his creation and champion, Iudex Gundyr into the conflict to weaken the Twin Princes and Aldrich from within.

I think this is true because so many creatures have genetically altered features to make them only useful to certain ends (mimics for unknowing thieves/conquerers in many of the castles and fortresses) or the capricious frequency of who has immortality (Patches, Andre) and the ubiquity of the armor sets in all games. Maybe Solaire thought models like the sun armor, or dragonslayer, or wolf knight's armor was preferable for his many disciples and soldiers?

Also, I didn't really play DS2, or the DLCS of ds1 and ds3. If you can find plot holes, additions, or just give a plausibility rating please do! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm hoping to join my local chapter when I go to HPU this Fall.

I was only wondering does the fundraising just go to your plans or does the fundraising also pay for the trip? I'm worried that in order to be a part of it, one will have to pay for their own airfare and other travel costs etc.

BS: What was one moment you experienced as part of your work that made you think that GB can actually make a difference? </TEXT>
