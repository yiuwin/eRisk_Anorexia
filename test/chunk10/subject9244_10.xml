	<TEXT>  Can a humorless show be great? My bias has long been that truly ambitious dramas are also funny, however submerged or black their jokes. And yet John Ridleys American Crime, on ABC, which is currently ending its third season (and likely its last, given the ratings), breaks that rule and is still a keeper. An astringent outlier in a dizzy age, it has none of the ironic pop songs and retro homages that dominate so many modern cable dramas. Its serious in an old-fashioned sense: sincere, thoughtful, and heartbreaking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like I enjoy a series more when it's more of a cinematic experience...bI still enjoy the shit out of things like *Castle*, *iZombie*, *Limitless* and the like, but find them to be overall of lower quality.

This is a very common mindset, and I can't stand it tbh. I'd take *iZombie* over *Game of Thrones* or *Westworld* every god damned day of the week. But because *iZombie* is a joyful show with a saturated color palette and a sense of humor, with some more familiar, longstanding storytelling elements it's somehow viewed as lower quality. This is the whole ["Pretige TV" discussion](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/5/11/15587088/prestige-tv) that is having a moment right now, btw. *iZombie*, *Jane the Virgin*, *Younger*, *Crazy Ex-Girlfriend*, *Billions*, etc., etc... Those are really fucking good, entertaining, compelling and thoughtful television shows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [thr](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/timeless-saved-cancellation-as-nbc-reverses-course-season-2-renewal-1003568) (my bold):
Producers Sony TV fought hard to keep the show going after the initial cancellation with both Kripke and co-creator/co-showrunner Shawn Ryan having pitched a family-friendly take on season two. Sources tell *The Hollywood Reporter* that the independent studio had been offering the lion's share of the profits to NBC in exchange for the renewal as SPT believe in the show's creative and that it has a solid chance to be a long-running, family-friendly franchise. Early buzz has the drama moving from its former 10 p.m. slot to a potential home at 8 p.m. as the show has been a favorite for co-viewing with parents and children. (The Smithsonian also hosted a panel for the show.)

...

Initially, NBC opted to renew *Blindspot* after Warner Bros. Television offered an ownership stake in the series and greater financial incentives. **Sony initially offered a financial incentive for the show to return but sources say NBC ultimately thought about more of the creative and the type of programming they'd want to invest in and picked it up without changing the terms of the co-production.** (*Timeless* is a co-production of Sony and NBC's Universal Television.) The series also ranked as the [fourth-highest scripted series](https://twitter.com/ShawnRyanTV/status/863445555057311745) when all delayed viewing is factored in.

Looks like it's the family-oriented angle that's most significant? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What the format really needs is someone smart to come along in a few years and reinvent the format to make something that's intelligent and breaks conventions.

I think *One Day at a Time* might have been a good first step. It was pretty serialized, and it had what seemed like a more organic rhythm to it, one that allowed for long character-driven, joke-less stretches...But there's also *Mom* and maybe another or two doing some interesting things.

I think you're right though; there could be some upside here. Maybe this stuff is just cyclical. I do still think there's value in the format. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems the author boiled it down to this:

By and large, online TV discussion is a product of the early 2000s, when the episodic recap sprang up at sites like Television Without Pity and was later used by critics like Alan Sepinwall to dissect a show piece by piece. (Disclosure: Both Sepinwall and TWOP co-founder Tara Ariano are friends of mine.) Some shows could withstand this exacting level of analysis; most could not. But the recap format dovetailed perfectly with the internets constant need for new stuff to look at, and it stuck.

The problem was that recaps didnt stick for every show equally. They were uniquely suited to serialized dramas, and if those dramas contained any pulpier elements, all the better. (*Mad Men* is the notable non-pulpy exception here.) But the format didnt work as well for comedies, or crime procedurals, or animated kids shows.

Meanwhile, the audience for TV recaps largely self-selected to be the kinds of people who wanted to read this sort of thing. And those people already had a very limited number of channels, starting with HBO primarily, that they considered worthy of serious attention. (That list has expanded  AMC and Netflix were later additions  but only rarely.)

As the number of sites competing for that finite number of eyeballs has grown larger and larger, the focus has drilled down ever more on the handful of shows that TV critics and the outlets they write for (including myself and Vox) *know* will capture your attention. *Game of Thrones* in essentially any form will garner a predictably large amount of traffic, while its much harder to get readers to look at articles about, say, *The Americans*, [try though we might](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/7/14844570/the-americans-season-five).

But the economy of talking about television on the internet is also a fan-driven one, which gives an edge to writers who like the shows they write about, usually, and to pieces that boost the shows they talk about. At a former job, an editor told me that people didnt want to read pieces that were critical of *Breaking Bad* during a week we had set aside for pieces about the show. And he was right  the [critical piece](http://www.avclub.com/article/the-case-against-ibreaking-badi-101439) we ended up running did well, but not nearly as well as more booster-oriented pieces.

This often creates the weird perception that absolutely everybody cares about shows like *Westworld* or *Fargo*, when those shows ratings  though good  arent nearly in the same league as the ratings of even the lower-rated shows on the four major broadcast networks. The reason is simple: People who care about these shows *really* care about them and will read most everything written about them. Its a seemingly unsustainable cycle that persists solely because nobody involved in it seems to mind being caught in it. </TEXT>

You had a scene in maybe the finale with Axe/Lana trying and failing to have sex (I feel like we've seen Malin Akerman's tits at least a few times now).

	<TEXT>  even if in the guilty pleasure kind of way

[rant incoming] The "guilty pleasure" thing has always irked me. I like what I like and I don't feel guilty about it. It's only entertainment at the end of the day; pleasure is the primary goal.

Shows like *Billions*, and like CW's offerings (hello, *iZombie*, *Jane The Virgin*) often get labeled as guilty pleasures and it never sits right. Just because some are genre shows, just because some are set in a heightened reality, just because they happened to be fun, joyful shows at their core doesn't make them inherently less-than.

Does *Billions* utilize some formulaic building blocks? Sure. Does it drip with verisimilitude? Hell no. But you know what? Those building blocks are well-worn at this point because they work! That reality is heightened because it works! It all lays some fertile ground for some real, entertaining emotional fireworks.

Utilize those tenets, then riff on it; that's all I want...I love *Billions* so much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This show just capped off one fantastic season of television. There's a lot of great TV on right now but *Billions* was the show I was quickest to pull off the proverbial DVR queue each week. It's simply so much fun to watch, which I think is a way-underrated quality in TV, or at least TV discussion, these days.

	<TEXT> The *Arthur Newman* issue, as a redditor [previously described](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/3qj1ii/heres_how_you_can_get_rid_of_arthur_newman_from/):

 Whenever Plex sees a file named `RARBG.com.mp4`, it likes to match it up with a movie named *Arthur Newman* for some reason. That file is actually just a little trailer thing for the RARBG release group, and it's included with a lot of movies.

 nbsp;

`RARBG.com.mp4` is in my .plexignore file as follows, which is [in my root movies directory](http://i.imgur.com/7GirrqC.png) (rest of file is copied over from [Plex's sample](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201375253-Excluding-New-Content-with-plexignore) and mostly commented out):
 \# Ignore RARBG vid

RARBG.com.mp4

 nbsp;

\# Ignore all files with "trailer" in the name

\*trailer*

 nbsp;

\# Ignore files with the extension ".cr2"

\# *.cr2

 nbsp;

\# Ignore directories called "Modified"

\# Modified/*

 nbsp;

\# Ignore all ".tif" files in the "thumbnails" subdirectory

\# thumbnails/*.tif

 nbsp;

I've scanned the library, I've refreshed, I still keeping seeing *Arthur Newman*s the Plex web UI. I've also tried variations on the name including `*RARBG.com.mp4`, `*RARBG.com*` and probably a few others. Any help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At NewsHour, long known for its slower pace, viewership is up 20 percent over this time last year, with an average of 1.24 million viewers a minute, according to Nielsen.

This audience is tiny compared with its [larger network counterparts](http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/while-cable-newsers-benefit-from-trump-bump-evening-newscasts-lose-1-million-viewers/322752), but the program tends to attract an engaged audience of highly educated viewers. (The average NewsHour viewer is 68 years old.) Ms. Woodruffs measured delivery, with her hands clasped and her voice low, stands as a counterweight to a haywire era of American news, and she evokes the formal manner of broadcast giants who came before her.

In a media landscape dominated more than ever by the pursuit of clicks and ratings, the thought of an hourlong newscast, untethered to the trends of the moment, seems almost radical. Ms. Woodruff thinks that viewers may be seeking out a more immersive broadcast.

We dont feel the need to go off on a tangent and cover something thats the Twitter story of the day, she said. Not the bright shiny thing that someone threw up in the air for a moment.

That is easier said than done when the person lobbing shiny objects is the president. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Over lunch at a nearby restaurant, Ms. Woodruff said that getting her start wasnt easy, and that she was told she could not be hired as a reporter by one prospective employer  he already had one woman reporter on staff and wouldnt be needing another. She was eventually hired at the CBS affiliate in Atlanta in 1970.

Theres no question that we were pioneers, she said of the female reporters of her generation. We were viewed as odd or exceptions.

She was modest as she considered a younger generation of reporters brought up in a digital news landscape: Im convinced that I could not keep up with the women out there in print and on TV now.

Nice try, her younger colleagues say.

Rachel Wellford, a 27-year-old politics producer, said Ms. Woodruff set a high standard in the newsroom, starting with the daily morning news meeting, where she is known for asking pointed questions.

We all struggle just to keep up with her, Ms. Wellford said. Shes just a workhorse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a choice. The cinematography isn't badly done, as someone said above, it's just understatedly done. And again, intentionally so. I imagine a lot of people prefer that style of direction for this show. It blends in; it doesn't distract; it lets the story and dialogue shine in their purest form. And the fact is, with regard to a bland (to use term used before) visual style fitting in with this show, or its era: "understated" is practically this show's middle name. *Everything* about it is understated, so I do think it fits. *Breaking Bad* this is not.

edit: Add it all up and this is still one of the best shows of decade, if not better than that. They can't be doing too much that's taking away from its entertainment value. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hulu has a few gems like *National Treasure* and *The Wrong Mans* (both great), and I think some people like *The Path*, Aaron Paul's current joint. Just-released *Harlots* seems OK. But their game really hasn't been originals, though that's starting to change a bit.

I know a lot of people are fans of Netflix's offerings. I just haven't been one of those people, relatively. So the calculus for me isn't the same as it'd be for a lot of folks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even Netflix originals. For every *Stranger Things* there are 20 throwaway shows. For me at least their hit rate is quite low. Hulu's original game is still burgeoning, but at least they have *Handmaid's Tale*, now, which along with *Casual* makes at least 2 that I keep up with off the top of my head. Both services are solid, though; each has their strengths and drawbacks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that this little microargument has been had 100x in this thread highlights an intuitive issue with RT's system. And a rather obvious one. People rightfully want to think of RT's signature percentage measure as an indicator of how good a show is: the higher the better, the lower the worse. If you understand the system as that -- as you probably should, given the site's goal -- stuff like this thread happens. Countless understandable misinterpretations and their facile counterarguments. RT's system, or their display of that system just isn't a good one for TV shows.

edit: So, in other words, they do know what RT is purporting to do, and don't like the results as shown. Understandably. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Top comment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/02/stephen-colbert-hits-trump-below-the-belt/?commentID=washingtonpost.com/ECHO/item/f5a7bd5d-1bff-4d0d-a539-1b1ed5ed638d outputType=comment utm_term=.8b9f23713aa2):

the Fox news commentator was making a joke about being turned on by a woman holding a microphone, that he saw her as an object for his sexual fulfillment, which is offensive in that it views women as objects of such fulfillment for men. Colbert's joke was about Trump being Putin's minion to the point he would service him sexually. The butt of this joke was one of the most powerful men in the world, and one whose link to a hostile foreign power is a danger to this country. It wasn't a joke about sex, it was about treason. It wasn't a joke about women, it was about a single, powerful man. The differences are profound. And if Trump had not introduced his own sexuality into the national discourse, through his accidentally captured comments bragging about sexually assaulting women, and his radio interviews with Howard Stern in the same vein, and his debate comments about the size of his private parts, I might feel differently about the coarseness of the joke. But given Trump's comments and behavior, the joke was not out of line, or "below the belt". Context matters. </TEXT>
