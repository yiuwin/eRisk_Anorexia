	<TEXT> I am currently working in the toddler room right now at my childcare 
This is the most  ridiculous thing I've ever heard...

We also have a few toddlers that are taller and more advanced... and can open the door.  - door-- becomes a game and they think its funny. staff just need to keep a watch and keep reminding him to leave the door alone. 

he also might be bothering other children because he is bored and needs new challenges !!!

I actually just had two children move into the preschool room this week . one (2.6yrs) was way over due but was having a hard time with the transition (3 days later hes loving it now) . the other boy (2.5yrs) was so excited to come he smiled and walked right in and hasn't looked back.


maybe this was a little off topic....   but I was trying to just say it has nothing to do with his tallness.  every child is different and learns at their own pace... 


Is there an older room for him to move into????
maybe that's all he needs. </TEXT>

 I saw it 2 weeks ago and it was really dark out so you couldn't see it in the picture... the next few days it rained so it washed off. I was so bummed I didn't get to take a photo. I thought it was amazing... 

Drove by again a few days ago and he had re-written it!!!
