	<TITLE> After the end of USSR, what happened with those that were arrested under the regime? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-17 18:23:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I watch a series called The Americans and in one episode a KGB officer said that even stealing a pen could be considered a crime of treason, thus that lead me to think that many were arrested without a real reason, or worse they weren't granted a fair trial. So what happened with those that committed "crimes" against the regime: did they have to complete their sentences? Did they have to go through another trial? Were they compensated financially for this unfairness towards them? Is this a stain in Russia's history? Are there people that were "forgotten" and their relatives still protest today? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have seen this a long time ago (early 2000 maybe?) and it was a part of the Just for laughs show and was this black background with some dude all black clothed with a white foam doll, it had a head two arms and would jump around, he would communicate with the sound of the kazoo; happy? Kazoo. Angry? Kazoo. Everything was kazoo, I don't know how to search for the video. Any help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Next Dimension there is also a Pegasus called Tenma, we don't know yet if this Tenma will fight Hades, but it is possible that he will. In the last chapter of the manga you can see that Hades says: "[He is identical to the only **man** able to hurt me.](https://lermangasonline.xyz/sys_mangas/00sdfrw/S/Saint%20Seiya/cap_48/0031.jpg)"
Remember when the Poseidon arc started and both [Saori and Julian knew they knew each other for centuries](https://lermangasonline.xyz/sys_mangas/00sdfrw/S/Saint%20Seiya/cap_23/0006.jpg)? Basically what they meant here is that a god can recognise another god even if Poseidon wasn't supposed to reincarnate in Julian - he was forced by Kanon. I think that Pegasus is the knight destined to protect Athena, much like how, possibly, Sorrento is Poseidon's Marina "protector".

Favourite child or not, I don't see the connection here, specially if you consider Seiya as "Zeus' reincarnated", if he was sent to protect her, is more likely, but still I am not one for this theory, maybe you will find someone else that agrees with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, he is not. As /u/redditismyhigh said Hades was talking about the ancient Pegasus Saint, I don't think he meant Tenma from Lost Canvas since this series isn't canon, but another Pegasus Saint that would get in his way just like Athena did before.

I don't think Zeus would bother to send a human to protect his daughter, a  goddess, and not only that Zeus lives in the Olympus, he doesn't care about Earth, for all he knows his brothers can kill each other and try to take care of Earth, he won't lose his seat. Another point worth mentioning is that in the Greek mythology Athena was born from Zeus' headache, Hephaestus - if I'm not mistaken - was the one that pulled Athena from his head; do you think he would bother with such an annoying daughter?

BTW, your first question is "Is Seiya the reincarnation of Zeus?" but then you wonder if Seiya isn't Zeus emissary, if any of those is possible I'd pick the latter, it wouldn't make sense a higher god appear to protect a "minor" god, it would be the same as saying Athena appeared to protect Nike (her staff). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You said they've been in danger, but it's hard to notice, so once again since you noticed give me an example. Dressrosa: was a combination of the new admiral policy against the shichibukai plus the people cheering for the pirates; Marineford: Shanks appeared; Impel Down: oh look a ship was here waiting for us, oh look Bon-chan stayed behind to close the gates; Enies Lobby: oh look Merry was waiting for us, oh look Aokiji didn't capture them even after buster call. No danger, just luck, now luck at Ace, for instance had his crewmate killed, got arrested by Blackbeard (even when Shanks asked Ace's retreat to Whitebeard) and killed by Akainu (because Luffy didn't pay attention) he was in real danger all the time, nothing saved him.

Even though I'm might sound like one, I'm not trying to be a douche, we just have to accept that Luffy wasn't in real danger he is just lucky. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly there are a few things to consider as well, for instance Luffy was only able to beat Cracker because Nami was with him, and Luffy was only able to get rid of ~~Kakashi~~ Katakuri because Jinbe helped, but I think that some people forget about some people that Luffy fought but were actually pretty strong. Enel is the greatest example, how many people in Grand Line or even the New World do you think would be able to beat him?

Another point that we should raise is Luffy's luck, besides Sabaody how many times were Luffy and the crew really in danger? What they lack in power they have in luck. </TEXT>

not really, no, the thing is shock spell damage magicka as well, and ice spells stamina, so the former is good against mages and the latter against fast creatures.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In **Bleak Falls Barrow**, you might have picked the Dragonstone before talking to Farengar.

In the quest **Sovngarde** when facing Tsun you might pick:

1. *"Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the dragon blood."*

2. *"I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-brother/sister to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain."*

3. *"Well met, mage of Skyrim. The Nords may have forgotten their forefathers' respect for the Clever Craft, but your comrades throng this hall. Here in Shor's house we honor it still."*.

4. *"You tresspass here, shadow-walker. Shor does not know you. Perhaps before the end you will earn the right to pass this way. Welcome I do not offer, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand."*.

5. *"Do not mistake the night-shrouded thief's stealthily-taken spoils, stolen and unearned, for a warrior's plunder, won in honorable battle. Your doom already binds you to your dark mistress, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand."*

In **Dawnguard** there are three approaches you can have with Lord Harkon:

1. You are "normal";

2. You are a vampire - "*You contracted a disease, perhaps, but you are no true vampire. Accept my gift and I promise that you will learn the difference. Refuse me, and I will banish you from this castle. I will spare your life this once, but after that, you are prey.*";

3. You are a werewolf - "*Yes, I can smell it on you. The power of my blood will purge that filth and make you whole again.*"

In **Dragonborn**, if you are talking with Neloth you might bring up that you are the Archmage of the College of Winterhold

1. *"Winterhold? That small college that is falling into the Sea of Ghosts? You're the one that recovered the Staff of Magnus. Impressive. Talvas should finish his apprenticeship in a couple of decades. Come see me then. I think I could teach you a trick or two."*

Also, if you finished the Dragonborn quest or **Discerning the Transmundane**, Hermaeus Mora will recognise you, saying that he has been following you since Miraak's defeat or, if I'm not mistaken, that you are a knowledge seeker. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As long as we are not aware that we live in a simulation what we experience is real, even when we doubt that we might be in a simulation it is still real, if you can't prove that we live in a simulation that doubt on reality doesn't have any base because you lack proof.

The dream thing, I don't think the brain can create information out of nowhere, if I am an engineer and I read an article about a field that I have no knowledge how could my brain create information that I didn't have before? Also if I am a butterfly, how can my small brain create those well developed scenarios? It doesn't make sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I can tell about Stan's relationship is that he is trying to make up with the wrongs he did with his ex-wife, he is trying to open up as much as he can, trying to make his relationship work out.

Gabriel's reason for leaving must have something to do with Elizabeth's psychiatrist mission, he decided to go home out of the blue because he is tired? Something is fishy.

Vegan guy is a womaniser, I read in another thread that vegan stuff was kind of a thing back in the 80's, so I wouldn't be surprised if he was flirting around that much, the reason for that would be the jealousy side of Elizabeth.

I don't understand that woman that Philip is trying to gather intel, we didn't see much of him so we can understand why does she call him "needy".

BTW in what year are we in the show? 83 or 84? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Only about 10 percent of the population is generally categorized as 'highly hypnotizable'", se eu acompanhar o meu horoscopo diariamente acredito que 10% do que l  previsto tambm vai ocorrer, astrologia pode tambm ser considerada uma cincia?

Spiegel and his colleagues screened 545 healthy participants and found 36 people who consistently scored high on tests of hypnotizability, as well as 21 control subjects who scored on the extreme low end of the scales.

Ou seja, menos de 7% do grupo era relevante para a pesquisa, juntam-se 21 de controle para uma nova e agora temos um total de 63% que podem ser hipnotizados.

Eu acho que depois dessa eu nem preciso comentar mais nada. </TEXT>

If you are talking about Hades, sanctuary arc: Aldebaran was killed by Deep Niobe, Shaka was killed against the "fallen" trio: Kamus, Saga and Shura. </TEXT>
