	<TEXT> Raising my nephew, my sister decided to keep the baby her boyfriend gave her. Then followed him all the way overseas, she left her 3 month  old child with our parents for whom were told she'd come back for. My parents are in their 70s and cant possibly look after him, so I became his family. There was a lot of shit going between my sister and my parents for years and the boyfriend didnt help the issue,but even though leaving him behind was a shit thing to do. It was probably for the better,she wouldn't be a good mother the boy deserves. But he's 3 now and the best kid in the world, I'm glad he didn't have have to grow up with his bitch of a mother. She hasn't even contacted us since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well if their whole culture wasn't strict half the time when they go out they wouldn't go over board. Also couldn't you just set it to recording and wait then go? You would avoid the flash sound and its a pretty easy way to get around it. But also if people are that worried why dont they just wear pants? And dont give me 'teach your sons to behave and not your daughters speech' its only select individuals who do it. I mean the culture/envioment breeds this behaviour. And whats the deal with no gag marriage? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, im looking for a video about comedy but i remember it being about back to the future and how the ending was set up to know it was ridiculous , like telling the audience whats in store and how its a rush on the countdown. Please and thankyou.

Edit: never mind I found it, its called the art of the scene the clock tower by cinifix. </TEXT>
