	<TEXT> unfortunately, under the contract we signed. the methods they used all could be arguably necessary to avoid any relapses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> -yeah she was really young. and yes it was discovered that very early comments that were made when she was around 9 or 10 were the root of all this

-she's been very successful! she is perfectly healthy at the moment and is very strong again! i think it was media icons like kylie jenner (she LOVES her) who are famous for their "thick" and curvy bodies.

-i agree that the facility was terrible. she had to call my mom and get her to figure out what was happening only by saying stuff like "yes" "no" or "yeah its great". it took a while but my mom figured it out and left to get her immediately. it was not beneficial. soon after we picked her up, we assembled our own team of therapists and doctors to help her and it worked! and yes, we would have absolutely chosen the "build-your-own" route rather than ever use this facility again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> -she was at the beginning of seventh grade, so she was 12.

-she still has anorexia, no doubt. she still has strange eating habits (like she calls her lunch at school "breakfast", eats lunch at 5:00, dinner at 8:00, then a snack at 10:00), and she now has developed OCD and is on medication for it. she doesn't like it when the door of a room is open, and she is the only one allowed to set the table when we eat. but i won't go into the cliche "anorexia never goes away" stuff. nevertheless, she is so, so much better. and i attribute that to today's media, ironically. she now wants a big butt and strong legs, and that's encouraging her to stay healthy in the right ways. she also will eat small amounts of pizza or cake on occasion -something she never would have done before.

-i'll give you all of the examples she has given me about the facility:
--no media. this means no phones, magazines, books, movies, tv, internet, etc. The only activities she would do was sit around and talk in therapy groups, write in a journal, or color in coloring books (without people to color of course)
--the patients were given no privacy. when they went to the bathroom, they had to count out loud as an attendant stood outside so they were sure they weren't making themselves throw up. same thing with showering -my sister takes long showers so she found herself counting to well above 500 every day in her shower.
--without a doubt the strictest part of this whole ordeal was the connection (or lack thereof) we were allowed to have with her. we were only allowed to call on tuesdays (someone was always in the room listening to the call), and visit once a month, and not on holidays (yes, if we hadnt taken her out of this hell, we wouldn't have seen her on thanksgiving). when we were allowed to visit, we could only be with her in one room in the house -no going outside, no showing us her room, etc.

-to help patients, they observed their eating/drinking habits and made sure they were getting back in a physically healthy state. they also held therapy groups multiple times a day and had girls write about their feelings. from what ive heard, not many girls were improving mentally.

-this facility is not exactly check-in. there were guidelines about entering and staying. for example, we signed up for two months. therefore, she was there fore two months, no exceptions unless she slipped into critical condition. she was expected to stay for the entire two months. </TEXT>
