	<TEXT> You don't understand what I'm saying, you said that

 if you've mastered one instrument it's not particularly hard to master others.

which is trivializing the work real work that musicians put in to mastering their instrument. It sounds as if "proficient" and "mastery" mean the same to you, which is a detriment to your own musical journey and others.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But your use of "mastery" is too strong and specific a word no? That's what I would like to clear up, for I use the word "proficient" to describe what your originally stated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry, but the notion that "once you've mastered one instrument, mastering other instruments is not particularly hard" is a huge misconception. Sure I agree, once you understand basic music theory, intonation, and practicing technique, picking up and learning other instruments becomes progressively easier. But mastery? On that point I have to question what you mean by mastery. As a violinist studying at a music school, as well as a multi-instrumentalist like yourself, I am constantly working towards the idea of mastering my instrument, and so are my peers. We work countless hours perfecting and honing our craft. The thought of picking up another instrument, even another string instrument, and trying to master that at the same time is near impossible, even for a proficient violinist as myself. I have to question your definition of "mastery" in your post, and how the likes of Bach, Mozart, Mendelssohn, etc. are considered geniuses for having mastered multiple instruments, beyond their compositional prowess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was asked by my old high school orchestral director to help select chamber music pieces that his students can play as part of their final project. The average level of playing is fairly novice, and they would be playing only one movement. I'm thinking along the lines of Mozart Quartet No. 10 C major, K.170 Menuetto. Thank you all!  </TEXT>
