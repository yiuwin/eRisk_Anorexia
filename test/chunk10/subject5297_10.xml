	<TEXT> I work in a district where our mascot is also the Blue Devil and some district officials are wanting to give the mascot a name other than the "blue devil". I was looking for help. Is the Duke Blue Devil referred to as the "blue devil" or does he have some sort of surname?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The years when he doesn't get hurt he hits a 1000 yrds. I understand that this isn't 2012 AP but the guy is a physical specimen. Less reps because of position depth, behind arguably the best line in the league,  I think (for the right price of course) it could work. I would love to see AP run over Von Miller for a 2 yrd touchdown. </TEXT>
