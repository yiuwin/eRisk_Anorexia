	<TEXT> Got talked into it by a neighbour, but I can't pull a good size hoot off it no matter what I try. I'm using shatter,  and I can barely get any smoke.  When I use it on high the coils don't even get red hot but the unit produces enough heat to cause a little vapor/smoke. 
Anyone else have an issue like this?  Just wondering if I got hustled into a piece of shit or if I should look into trying to get this thing working better 
Thanks everyone 
The model is Cheech and Chong world piece: Nitro </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've seen people use handheld vaporizers for extracts,  they look similar to the tobacco ones.  I am considering getting one but am wondering how people's experiences with them have gone..  I don't expect a heat coil would work but I am hoping for the best. 
Thanks pals! 



Edit: would be used with shatter most likely  </TEXT>
