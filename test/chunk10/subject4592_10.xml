	<TEXT> Yeah, your working harder to help yourself, which you are still doing, even if your money was just being thrown into a pit by the government.

	<TEXT> With a properly tuned progressive tax system, there is no situation where making more money would stop making you more money.  
You see additional income for each additional dollar you earn.  
Well calibrate it is perfectly fair, again due to marginal utility.  
You get diminishing returns from the joy of having more money, so at low income levels a tiny tax level is a huge imposition of the government for the good of us all.  
The exact same percentage removed for someone just running up the score on the money is just a minor inconvenience, so the government ramps it up to the point where it is a huge imposition.  
Calibrate the tax code to make it "grudging lesser evil" instead of "huge imposition" and you have what the tax code should be.  
Completely fair distribution of government misery for the greater good of us all.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Marginal returns.  
Each additional dollar brings more utility the fewer dollars and individual has on hand. A 20 dollar bill to a starving hobo is a godsend, a 20 dollar bill to a billionaire is a rounding error.  
Distribute it more evenly and we increase total utility for the society.  
  
Ignoring this argument and morals aside, from a purely self-interested point of view.  
The rich man just lets those additional dollars sit in his bank account.  
The poor man has to spend that money on things he needs to live, like food.  
The person who sells that food gets the dollar, he spends it on a luxury,  
The rich man sells that luxury, he gets the dollar and lets it sit in his bank account.  
  
So that 1 dollar to the poor man result in 3 separate transactions stimulating the economy,  resulting in 3 people having their lives improved, resulting eventually in the exact same end result as if you just gave it to the rich man.  
Meaning that you had more opportunities to be the person benefiting from the economic transaction.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And you seem to be saying that somehow combining the already awful behavior of politicians in the modern era with the kind of self-assuredness that comes from leading a major religion will somehow result in LESS violence.   
Despite all the evidence that the Popes, when given secular power, often committed atrocities.    
So, basically neither the fancy hat or the fancy church have never been good at stopping a Pope from doing that kind of thing.  
We don't even need to speak in hypothetical for religion and military power not resulting in anything good, just look at ISIS or Boko Haram.

[Pope Clement VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII) ruled during the 16th century for example.  
And also your edit shows that the Popes exercising their influence caused death comparable to modern era deaths, in an era where there were far fewer people to kill, using far more inefficient killing devices.  
But those were deaths caused by their actions as a Pope, not a direct ruler.  
They had far less power as direct rulers, but used often used that to murderous ends.   </TEXT>

A Stinger Missile is a form of arms, a Domestic Terrorist is a citizen.

	<TEXT> Genghis Khan.  
Most of history is caused by inexorable historical forces, but there's nothing that would seem to more or less guarantee that the mongols of all people would be able to conqueror the largest land empire ever created.  
It's pretty much all on him.  
Without him, the silk road remains closed and Europe never gets the black death for example.    
Plus he's the direct ancestor of something like 5% of the population of China and Eastern Europe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, this isn't caused by refresh rate as some people might suggest.  
That was true of older CRT monitors and modern monitors are mostly LCD.
That was caused by the monitor not putting the whole image at the same time and doesn't look like what you are describing.  
   
I'm willing to bet that a [Moir pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern) looks more like what you are describing.  
That's because your screen is a more or less perfect grid of tiny pixels.  
You're phone's camera is composed of a more or less perfect grid of tiny color sensors.  
The two grids don't line up, so the patterns interfere with each other, causing the Moir pattern. </TEXT>

If there was somehow a guarantee regulations would not come back form a decade or so, then the US reverts to the kind of environmental damage that was being done.  
[Such as rivers so polluted they caught fire.](http://time.com/3921976/cuyahoga-fire/)  
[Various other sites so contaminated it's literally cancerous to step foot there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Canal)  
  
A few years of that, a great many deaths and disfigurements and a few billion in needless clean up costs later; There will be a slim chance that the people of the US why those regulations were put in place and the EPA will be restored in a new form, but most likely they'll blame someone else and keep dying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The lady who spilled hot coffee on her lap and suing McDonald's.  
Yes it happened, but the lawsuit was far from frivolous.  
  
For starters she was a septuagenarian, she was in her son's car in the parking lot while the car was stationary when she spilled the coffee on her lap.  
The coffee was so hot it caused 3rd degree burns, she had to get a skin graft. Her initial lawsuit was just to cover the cost of the extensive hospitalization she needed.  
The jury ruled that McDonald's coffee was unnecessarily and dangerously hot. It did not need to be at a temperature where 10 seconds of contact with skin would cause severe injury.   
After the lawsuit they reduced the temperature so it wouldn't be that dangerous, then they went on a smear campaign to discredit her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since the last update I can't seem to find the option to turn on travel mode for Oculus Video.  
Using it to watch videos in a bus without getting motion sickness is one of the main reasons I have he Gear VR.  
The current system of tapping the side often leads to the screen in awkward positions and I would greatly prefer if it was done automatically like the travel mode used to do.  
So is it gone? Or is it just placed somewhere else? </TEXT>

If they drunk real alcohol, they would get drunk really quickly and not be able to act.  
If the character was an alcoholic in a long running series and the actors had to drink real alcohol, they would become real alcoholics.    
  
Also recall it's ok for a character to die in a show, but it's not OK to kill an actor just for a show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the most likely scenario for this system, if it were implemented in the United States, is that both the democrats and republicans would run several candidates in the first round and use it as a national primary.  
  
That scenario alone would make it worth it.  
Put Hillary and Bernie on the ballot without fear of them taking votes from one another and see which one the American People pick.  

But the ideal scenarios is if the Libertarian or Green party actually fielded good candidates they might get enough votes to drum up more funds for campaigning in future elections, making them more competitive.  </TEXT>
