	<TEXT> Yes this. Are you looking just to create graphics for your app/website, small elements (back buttons, home buttons etc) or redesign the whole thing? Is there an exisiting design or is it from scratch? Is UX important? I'm UX/UI too, but if you just need a graphic designer to create a brand, I can point you to some good freelancers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found out when I posted about being raised a Muslim and being a lesbian and it was [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/5gz0iz/essay_on_being_raised_as_a_muslim_and_knowing_i/?st=J2BUXGIV sh=3c076086) 149 days ago. If my creepy-Pm'er is reading this, then thank you. Posting your PM has now shared my story (and probably thousands of other people in similar situations) more. I'm sure this is exactly what you wanted. More people knowing that there are gay people who use to be Muslim. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really wish they hadn't deleted their account. I would have loved to have a dialogue with this person. Are they upset because they are a lesbian? Are they a male who has a wife/child/friend that is a lesbian and they have to deal with that? Honestly, I just want to know, why take the time to look through my profile and find something I posted a while ago, (I posted ages ago about this, not recently) and hate on me about it.

Edit: [I hope he or she replies to my post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/69iqyl/dear_my_troll_helloooo_is_it_me_youre_looking_for/)

Edit again: they removed my thread, because it gives the troll attention. Oh well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was raised as a Muslim, but from a very young age, I realised I was gay. I tried to hide it with religion but it didn't help and I hated myself everyday. When I was 15, I started having feelings for my best friend. She returned the feelings and we had to keep a secret. Her parents found out and flipped, not because we were a same sex couple, but they thought that my parents would find out and blame their daughter. They forbid us to see each other, but of course, as teenagers, we kept seeing each other. It was really hard keeping it a secret. When we were 18, she broke up with me and started dating a guy. I was pretty heartbroken and we didn't speak for a long time. It's been about 15 years since we broke up, I still consider her a friend and we talk occasionally. I'm now dating an amazing woman whom I love very much, and she's with her boyfriend who she loves. 

TL;DR had a secret lesbian relationship with my best friend and had to hide it due to religious parents. Broke up after 3 years, its been 15 years and we are still friends. </TEXT>
