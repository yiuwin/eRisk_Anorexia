	<TEXT> So pretty much I am suspended at the moment (for two days), but I was suspended for literally nothing.

So pretty much, a week ago I was outside the school library at lunch, talking to my friends and there was this little year 7 prick, and he was kicking me in the leg (for some unknown reason). I asked him to stop, but he kept kicking me. So I asked again, ignoring me he still kept kicking. So I got up of the ground up walked up to him, and bumped into him. He then ran down the stairs and lost his balance near the bottom and fell (the library is up a lot of stairs). He went home and his mum asked him why his pants had a tiny little hole in it, he said that I pushed him down the stairs (this was on Thursday (last Thursday, 11/5)). On Monday I came to school and went up to library, my brother was there (he is in year 7), and he told me that one of the kids at the library was being a little fucking prick and bullying another student that has problems. He was being pretty annoying, so naturally I told him to be quiet (this was in the "quite" room of the library), but he kept saying filthy frank quotes (like "ay boss" and such), so I said "Shut the fuck up you pathetic piece of shit. Kill yourself". Another girl in the room thought that I was talking to her and she got really upset. I was sick with a migraine on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I wasn't at school. But when I went to school on Thursday (yesterday), the year 9 co-ordinater called me into his office and told me that I was suspended internally for Thursday and Friday, so I spent the day in "solitary confinement" (a small room off the side of one of the co-ordinaters offices). So here I am, in this little fucking room, writing this on a school MacBook using a VPN because the school banned reddit overnight. God I hate this fucking school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very, very nice site.

Just one suggestion though: Implement a button on the admin side to indicate if a card is foil or not.

I will defiantly be using this as my main stock/inventory program for my eBay store :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey /r/MagicTCG,


I am a 15 year old that just recently got into magic, and tonight I will be attending my first FNM event (a booster draft) tonight. I was wondering if you could give me some tips on how I can build a competitive draft deck (like what colors to use/avoid, how many land to use etc... you know, basic stuff)?


Thanks

	<TITLE> 15 Year old wanting to buy $5 or so worth of bitcoin </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey /r/BTC,

I am a 15 Year old from Australia that wants to "invest" $5 or so in bitcoin.

I have tried buying from multiple sites, but couldn't because they all required mobile phone verification, and I don't have a mobile, so I was unable to verify my accounts meaning I was unable to buy any bitcoin.

So, I am looking to buy $5 USD worth of bitcoin from someone here. I can pay via PayPal or Bank transfer. I would prefer to buy off an Australian, but can buy off someone in USA if no Aussies want to sell (or if you offer a good USD/BTC rate).



Thanks

-Joshua </TEXT>
