Someone replied, "Can you imagine anything worse than getting yelled and cursed at just because your Muslim?"

I shared the article of the Afghani mom that was stabbed to death in front of her children by a Muslim man because she converted to Christianity.

	<TEXT> My son started cussing after he was put into a class  in 2nd grade for kids with behavioral issues.

He started cussing like crazy imitating the other kids.  We had multiple talks with him about how to follow social rules, and social rules don't allow cussing. He asked why the kids in the class are allowed to cuss, and we said they aren't following the social rules.  He stopped cussing after awhile, and we pulled him out of that class.  So I don't know if it was just removing him from the situation or explaining social rules helped but it's something to try. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anonymous rape threats happen on both sides though.  Ask female conservatives how often they are threatened with rape, etc.  I don't think it's an anti-feminist issue, but an issue with weak men who feel powerful behind a keyboard.
