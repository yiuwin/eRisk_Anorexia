	<TEXT> I'm having trouble figuring out this one. I know old medieval levies were phased out and replaced with standing armies ( like the french lances) and mercenaries. Surely these two would be too expensive to fill the army with, and standing armies would generally be limited (French lances only provided cavalry). So how did they fill out the rest of the army ? In pavia there were around 35 k infantry in total, surely not all of them would be swiss mercenaries. Also around this era roman type of drills returned because huge pike formations needed it. Were standart country armies equipped with pikes and drilled as well ? Or they still fought in medieval levy type. Can someone enlighten me in this ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whenever i try to go for a admin-influnce-humanist blob like hell game, i either have good manpower issues, end up with like ottos+commonwealth+ming rivaling me, or rebels break my country. For instance, i tried a Mongol run. Ming helped me with independence and i ate a good part of the oirat. Next i attacked one of the manchus. Got some bad rolls and had to white peace. Next minute, most of my neighbors attacked me since i had no manpower. And i see guys left and right telling ai is shit and SP is easy. is there some very important trick of blobbing i am missing ? Or do i have to be lucky with rulers and rolls ? How do i start the snowball ? Can you guys give me tips ? ( Also im decent enough not to get coalitioned. I try to expand in multiple directions but i still get stopped)

	<TITLE> Dive bombing with a stuka (RB) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-07 19:50:02 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I can bomb in AB's alright and I grinded my way to D-5, bombing in Arcade, where it is much easier. Now I decided to start playing Realistic battles. Tried diving about a dozen times now. One or two resulted in hit. A few missed. Most resulted in me diving to ground at high speed. Especially medium and heavy tanks, they require almost a direct hit to explode and I guess you need about a 90 degree dive for that. Well it seems I just have the tool ! Except I can't even manage that. Could someone explain me how to properly dive bomb with a stuka (or any dive bomber) ?


A few more questions : 

-I learned that I have to use airbrakes. Should I turn my engine off as well ?

-Should I dive from 3rd person view or from cockpit for good accuracy ?

-What is a good diving angle and altitude ?

-When should I release my bomb and pull off ? ( I basically drop right beneath at shallow angles because I can escape. I learned that dives require longer distances to escape the bomb impact) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For instance, BF 109 E has three models. After getting E-1, why should I research E-3 instead of jumping to F model, which is clearly    superior. Could someone explain me the logic behind this ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you TD your divisions, the germans will simply have no chance to cross the river, except if they have the air superiority and a large amount of CAS. This also works the other way, if you have the air superiority and good quantities of CAS, he will NOT pass the river. (also level 5 fort the smonlensk area since its the only passage without river).

Now, on one versus one, the germans will best you in air combat because of their sheer production capacity. There are two ways you can win against them :

First is that the allies actually do something and take off a hefty chunk of his airforce, and you are able to gain air superiority.

Second is they lend lease you aircraft instead and you fight him in the air, winning after a lot of losses. 

In best scenario, they should both bomb germany and send you aircraft. If you are sure that allies won't do anything, then just build SPAA and try to upgrade their air attack with experience. They will help a lot.

What I'm trying to tell you here is when attacking river+forts, their ground units get a very large penalty. Their only way of damaging you is by air. You have to prevent that, if you want to hold your river. And if you hold your river, allies' superior industry and your manpower will win the war in the long term. (hopefully) </TEXT>
