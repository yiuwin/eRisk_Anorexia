	<TEXT> Mr friend's not nearly at the stage of your friend but seems like he's developing the same attitude.

I feel bad for your friend man, although I can totally relate to how it was a nuisance to you. Did you cut him off completely? Was it gradual or overnight? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man I feel like a dick saying this but how do you guys deal with friends that are depressed? I'm not the happiest guy on earth but I try to be positive, but whenever he texts me he always has some negative shit to say and it always drains my energy to read that type of shit. Puts me in a more depressive mood. E.g. I ask him a simple what's up and he sends me a huge block of text telling me about the shitty day/week he had.

I wanna help him but the man doesn't even try to help himself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I bought these headphones during the boxing day sale from best buy. Silly me I should've read their return policy. On their site it says headphones can only be returned if the box is unopened. I've used it for about 2 hours total since I received it yesterday.

	<TEXT> Yeah I don't intend to create any drama out of this lol, I'm pretty happy with my friends other than this tiny detail so I think I'll just try and get over it.

But question for you, when you make plans with 1 or 2 friends without telling the others, why do you exclude them? If they find out, do they talk to you about it?

I ask because it's happened a few times where plans happen where a couple of friends weren't even invited, and I always feel bad for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've known this girl for over 5 years now (we're 20-21) but we never really talked. Our parents were good friends so she'd come over about once a year but nothing ever really happened. Anyway, a month or so ago they came over again. I tried to isolate her but couldn't since we were all at the dinner table, but I did get her number. A few days later we met up at school (different schools but very close) during a break and we had coffee. Wasn't the best "date" but it was the first time one-on-one.

Felt like seeing her again so last night I texted her. So far she hasn't answered at all. It's pretty unusual, I really doubt it's intentional, she's not the type of girl to pull that. Should I hit her up on facebook? How can I let her know I texted her without sounding needy?

Edit: Just to make things clear I wouldn't mind nexting her but I also wouldn't mind just having her as a friend, she's pretty cool </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last week I got invited to a friend's place for dinner and whatever afterwards. We were around 10-15. At around 11, after we finished eating, we started playing a board game that I don't particularly like. After half an hour, I was bored to death. I ended up staying in until 2-3 AM, when everyone left.

For the last 3 hours I wanted to hop in my car and leave. How do I go about doing this politely? I'd feel uneasy randomly standing up and thanking the host for the night and just leaving. Do I make up an excuse? I wouldn't want to make the host feel bad.

Thanks in advance! We're 19.

	<TITLE> Any tips on preventing dust from accumulating in the camera lens? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My 5S got replace for free today (under warranty) because the camera had lots of specks in it and the quality of photos went way down because of the dust.

I never dropped the phone, although I never put a case on it.

How do I prevent this from happening? Every iPhone I've had has had this issue where the photo quality gets reduced. My friend's 5 on the other hand, take perfect pictures. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't know if I worded the question correctly.

Basically I wanna run around the neighborhood a bit while listening to music. I can't keep the device in my pocket because it'll be a nuisance to my running. I can't hold it in my hands because of sweat and the inconvenience of it.

What's the best solution? Thank you. </TEXT>
