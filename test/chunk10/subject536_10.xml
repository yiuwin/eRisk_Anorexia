	<TEXT> This is the first time I've been on here in a really long time. I wanted to share some pics of me that I took around 2-3 weeks ago since I don't have any recent. But this is me about a month into recovery. I feel like I don't really have an eating disorder since I wasn't bad enough to have to do inpatient, but I dunno. Its a huge struggle. I feel like I wasnt skinny enough for doctors to worry about me. :( I can see that I'm skinny in my stomach usually but my thighs look huge to me.

	<TEXT> I've been dealing with extreme hunger, but yet I still feel like I'm not "anorexic enough" to give into it. I got down to a BMI of about 17, which to me was just barely under the underweight mark. I've been dealing with a restrictive eating disorder for about three years now. I don't have my period and I've experienced low heart rate, mild malnutrition, thinning of hair, drying of skin, and faintness on a regular basis due to my eating disorder.
I don't get to see my doctor, therapist, and dietician for another few weeks as I'm studying abroad. I'm getting about 20,000 steps in a day so I'm a lot more active, though my meal plan was changed to add a snack to accommodate this. However, even when following my meal plan I'm still just so hungry.
Does the general rule of 2500-3500 apply to me and should i give into extreme hunger? I feel as though because i'm not really in intensive outpatient or inpatient my anorexia nervosa is only "mild" and I don't need to really recover much.
Any advice is appreciated, thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to fast on Wednesdays. It wasn't the best experience in the world physically, but mentally it made me feel way better about myself. Though it would cause me to eat more on Thursdays, and I think had i restricted normally I would've lost more weight. It wasn't something worth sticking with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel this, but on the other hand, I can't help but think I'd feel more guilty knowing there's someone out there going through the pain I am, and using my body to fuel that self hatred. It makes me feel selfish and impure. I want to suffer because I hate myself, not because I want to make others hate themselves more. </TEXT>
