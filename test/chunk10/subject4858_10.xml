	<TITLE> French Revolution Book Recommendation(s)? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-17 23:20:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I love the French Revolution. I'm heading to Paris in August and would love to more fully understand it. Does anyone have a book that might be good at fully explaining the French Revolution without being too academic (aka is there a readable book about this)?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 5.5 days in Iceland </TITLE>

	<TEXT> We're flying in on April 26 and out May 1. How brutal will the weather be? And has anyone gone for about 5 days and has a sample itinerary? We are ending with some friends at the Blue Lagoon April 30, otherwise no plans yet. Flying into Reykjavik but down for anything. Any ideas? Thanks in advance! Probably just want to do all the cool scenery and outdoorsy stuff that we can, weather permitting </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome, thanks so much, and congrats on whatever you're doing. I feel like honestly, only people who do this stuff know how hard it is. But it beats having a boss :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Amen! I'm not even against the 18-hour days because I like what I do, but things like the recent USPS hike just crush us...stuff like that makes me want to try something new. Congrats on your success! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I'm in Utah. The one big plus I see for my biz is it CAN be done by a stay-at-home mom (and it's not MLM!!!) and we have a ton of those around. But of course that's not actually going to add value, just make the sale more attractive (I think). The more I'm reading, I think it might make more sense to keep growing it like I am. I make good money and it's relatively fun, I'm just a bit bored with it really </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hear ya. I'm in printed items (clothing, etc) so my guess is the multiple would be quite small, but even the profits x 3 makes sense, so thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, this is extremely helpful. Do businesses like these just sell on classifieds sites? I am curious where I could even list, if I wanted to.  </TEXT>
