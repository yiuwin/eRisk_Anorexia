	<TEXT> Ive had the same fight with multiple redwinged blackbirds. They had had a nest of yougnens in my yard and every year they mate they always build the nest in the same spot, they only attack when the nest is full, they peck and swipe at the back of your neck till they draw blood, theyll wait for you on branches and divebomb the car. I had enough and bought a pellet gun. Now crows are more intellegent so goood luck my friend </TEXT>
