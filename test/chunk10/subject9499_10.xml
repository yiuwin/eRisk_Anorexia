	<TEXT> Eugene Terre'Blanche, he wasn't a murderer but he was an all round shitty person and people were pretty elated when he died. He was a white-supremacist and Afrikaaner nationalist in South Africa. He was also the founder of the on going Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistence Movement) which is a group of Afrikaans neo-nazi. In 2010 he was beaten to death by 2 of his farm workers in his sleep.
