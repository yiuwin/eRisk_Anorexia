	<TEXT> They even manage to include Martin Garrix in every post, even when its about the laptop ban on flights from europe to usa "Which means artists like Martin Garrix can't produce on the plane anymore"

even when talking about tracks from other artists they use martin garrix pictures as the header image and then write something like "Martin Garrix once played a song from that DJ, now that guy released a new track"
 
 The label that birthed Martin Garrix, JAUZ   more international superstar DJs is on the verge of selling

	<TEXT> Yeah I think so, I have a 34 ultrawide and I play some games in 1440p with black bars. Its kinda weird and a hassle to configure it in the driver settings and the display settings because on some games it works without problems and with others I have to dry different settings.

I think if you want to play games in 1080p on an ultrawide monitor you can also use a 34" ultrawide monitor as long as the 34 has the 2560 x 1080 resolution.

if you mean screen height, then a 29inch ultrawide is as high as a 24 inch 1080p monitor i think.

I use this site to compare different monitor sizes and aspect ratios:

	<TEXT> I liked the show to a point.  His whiney voice gets old fast. He relies on schtick that has been over used.  With that said, there were a couple sweet episodes, but even those were derivative of others' work. (Ala, immigrant stories.)

Though he seems sincere and fairly likable.  It is an okay show for people who are already fans of Aziz.

I think his characters on Silicon Valley and That 70s Show were better.  Plus he was also really good on The Big Bang Theory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello there I have an 34 inch ultrawide (3440 x 1440px) monitor and I want to scale down to a custom resolution to QHD (2,560 x 1,440 resolution at a 16:9 aspect ratio) in my AMD graphics card settings. 
However I cant find any information about the "**timing**" part.

 What do I put in those other fields?

	<TEXT> the huge influx of cheaters make this game unplayable and absolutly unenjoyable for us regular players. Meanwhile the devs are ignorant about it and do nothing about it. they keep ignoring our tweets and messages and do not communicate at all how they want to deal with the cheaters.


instead they add things like binoculars. so of course people are complaining here and shaming users because how else will facepunch do something about it. yet you want to censor us and stop posting about cheats. of course more posts about cheating are value because it shows that its not just one user who has experienced cheaters but instead a widespread problem that destroys the game for many people. so more threads = more visibility about the problem


cheating is a big problem which the devs need to finally to something about </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello there,
I want to buy a ultrawide monitor however I know my CPU will bottleneck things and I am wondering if its possible to run games in an 16:9 1080p mode on an 1440p ultrawide monitor? or will it "stretch" things our or will there be black bars left and right? when there are black bars does the GPU have to calculate those?
