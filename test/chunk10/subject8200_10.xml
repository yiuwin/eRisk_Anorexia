	<TITLE> Telephone Poles </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Bell needed to hire a team of telephone pole installers for Fort McMurray and the boss had to choose between a team of two guys from Newfoundland and a team of two Irish guys.
 
So the boss met with both teams and said "Here's what we'll do. Each team will be installing poles out on the new road for a day.  The team that installs the most phone poles gets the job."

Both teams headed right out. At end of the shift, Pat and Mike, the Irish guys, came back and the boss asked them how many they had installed. They said that it was tough going, but they'd put in twelve.

Forty-five minutes later, Bud and Buddy, the Newfoundland guys came back in and they were totally exhausted.  The boss asked, "Well, how many poles did you guys install?"
Bud, the team leader, wiped his brow and sighed, "Buddy and me, we got three in.
"The boss gasped, "Three? Those two Irish guys put in twelve!"

"Yeah," said Bud, "but you should see how much they left sticking out of the ground!"

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My wife posted this on her Facebook:39 years ago I was pregnant with our first child. It was close to Valentine's Day, and like many an expectant mother, I was craving something sweet. We didn't have a lot of money back then, (um, still don't ), but hubby stopped by our local Tim Horton's (donut shop in Canada) and came out with a humongous box. We got home and I opened it, took one look at a supersize donut
and said.. "What the heck does that mean?". He looked at me as if the baby brain was affecting my abilities to read, and said.. *duh, Be Mine*. I said, no.. look at it.. it says "Be My Mine". He laughed and said "no wonder it was only 50 cents". Over these years, he's signed cards with the saying, he's had it put on cakes, he even had it made into Chinese lettering (even though the guy insisted it "make no sense mister". So today I made this for him/us. I'm sure not everyone is going to read this, and will comment that the phrase... "make no sense mister". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 
My wife  found out that our dog, a Schnauzer, could hardly hear,
so she took it to the vet.
The vet found that the problem was hair in the dog's ears.
He cleaned both ears and the dog could then hear fine.
The vet then proceeded to tell Andrea that, if she wanted to keep this from
recurring, she should go to the pharmacy
and get some "Nair" hair remover and rub it in the dog's
ears once a month.
Andrea went to the store and bought some "Nair" hair remover.
At the register, the pharmacist told her, "If you're going to use this under
your arms, don't use deodorant for a few days."
Andrea said, "I'm not using it under my arms."
The pharmacist said, "If you're using it on your legs, don't use body lotion
for a couple of days."
Andrea replied, "I'm not using it on my legs either. If you must know,
I'm using it on my Schnauzer."
The pharmacist said, "Well, stay off your bicycle for at least a week."

	<TITLE> The frequency of sexual activity of senior males. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-29 23:13:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The frequency of sexual activity of senior males depends on where they were born. 

Statistics just released from Statistics Canada and The United Nations B.O.H. Team, reveal that: North American, Australian, New Zealanders 
and British men between 60 and 80 years of age, will on average, have sex two to three times per week, (and a small number a lot more), whereas Japanese men, in exactly the same age group, will have sex only once or twice per year if they are lucky. 

This has come as very upsetting news to both me and most of my buddies at the golf club, as none of us had any idea that we were Japanese.
