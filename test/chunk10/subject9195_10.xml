	<TEXT> Hey guys!


I'll admit, that yours is not a sub I often frequent, it seemed the most appropriate for this question. Please forgive me, if this is not the right place to post this.
My high school's marching band performs in competitions around the state, all leading up to a state championship performance. (marching band has changed a lot in the last 20 years)

This year, we are doing a show on WW2. Really though, its going to be a social commentary on the nature of war itself: what is worth fighting and dying for, the morality of war, and the multiple perspectives that form around the same war (primarily American and Japanese).

To really sell the idea -we only have ~8:00 mins to make people recognize the idea, understand it, and then have some deeper moral considerations- we're looking for some audio clips to play alongside the music.

These could be parts of speeches, radio interviews, propaganda, slogans, found footage sounds from the fields, radio transmissions... the list goes on. Preferably short -a best line or two, we can't really run a full speech. Some clips in foreign languages would be nice, but I'm looking for stuff in English primarily.

Feel free to send in ideas from anything and everything that you think might fit.


Thanks in advance!!

	<TEXT> My mom worked with a kid who's first and middle names were "Kawazar Fier" - Pronounced "Quasar Fire"- he had several siblings, all with an astrological first name, and an "element" middle name. 

Parents were apparently giant hippies, and didn't see anything wrong with it </TEXT>
