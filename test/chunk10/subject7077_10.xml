That's a weird descriptor. I keep imagining a super tall guy next to a super short guy, and the tall guy thinks he is morally superior cause he is taller.

In marriage they willfully gave their perpetual consent, zero strings attached.

Can there still be assault? Yes. Can there still be abuse? Yes.

Well legally it's rape so that's pretty much the end of that discussion imo. Law enforcement and the state don't really give a shit that the interpretation of your religious doctrine thinks it isn't rape. (At least in the US). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You looked better when you were on heroin.

This seems like a pretty mean thing to say. And it might just be my personal preference, but I definitely prefer the right side. Although in general who gives a shit what she looks like as long as she is off heroin, good for her. 

The girl on the left has realistic expectations, likes to enjoy the moment instead of worrying about peer pressure. On the right we have an instagram addict who changes boyfriends like socks and makes you feel like she's too good for you and you don't deserve her.

Hmmmm, gimme more of that projection and bitterness. 

Nah the one on the right keeps dropping "subtle" hints about kids, about marriage, and always seems to be sizing you up when there's a child around. You can never quite trust the contraceptives with the one on the right. Also the one on the right must be mentally deficient if she finds you attractive. This makes her less attractive. The one on the left, if she had an orgasm, it probably wasn't fake. She seems like the type where if you weren't satisfying her she'd tell you.

Now that's the good stuff.  </TEXT>

Yeah. I'm sure a healthy dose of shaming him into silence with "is that all you think about? What's wrong with you!" is just what the doctor ordered.

She doesn't want to have sex with you. All her excuses are bullshit. She might be fucking someone else or she might just not be attracted to you anymore. Break up with her. This will not get better, only worse.

The projecting is fucking real in this thread.

~~I wonder if anyone has ever received actually helpful advice on that sub, it always seems to be projecting and accusing rolled into a large ball they then throw at OP's head.~~

I would never expect my fiance to discuss miscarriages and the complications of having a baby with my mother. That's such a personal topic. She has every right to handle it in the way she feels is healthiest. And talking to an over-bearing MIL doesn't seem like that.

And it still doesn't excuse the fact that she is leeching off of him. If they know she can't have kids, the normal recourse would be for her to find something to do to contribute to the household.

Can you imagine this conversation? 

"Honey, I know you can't have kids because you're infertile and have had miscarriages, so let's find something else productive for you to do."

But signs of public affection are really frowned upon and considered rude. It's a cultural custom. I study Islam but I regret to say I don't know the origins....maybe I'll go learn that tonight. 

Anecdotally, I met my now fiance while studying abroad there. She looks Moroccan and dressed Moroccan while she was there (she's half Asian but could easily be considered Middle Eastern). We were on a date in the back of a cab and I leaned over to give her a kiss and the cab driver was not thrilled. He told me not to. Then when he saw us holding hands he gave us a dirty look and tried to end the cab ride early.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly this. Askreddit threads ask all the time "Men of Reddit, what don't women know that they should" or some shit and it's always "You're so beautiful natural and without make-up". 

I would wager the majority of those guys have no clue what no make-up looks like and couldn't tell the difference one way or another. Shit I've been with my fiance for four years and I still sometimes don't realize she has a light layer of mascara on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I especially love the guys who in Askreddit threads will say "Women don't understand that they look best in a large t-shirt with no makeup", when they're purely basing it on pictures of models in make-up (made to look natural) and large t-shirts.

They have no clue what they're talking about.  </TEXT>

Oh good, I was worried the "muh free speech" argument wasn't being used anymore.

I didn't say it was illegal. I said it was suppression. Which it is. I don't care if ANTIFA wants to hold a celebration of Mao Zedong, they shouldn't be interrupted and oppressed. But apparently, it's a one-way road.

He's totally on point. Speaking of, I've been meaning to invite all of you to my pro-Stalin party I'm having this weekend in my neighbors back yard. He doesn't want me to hold it there, but free speech.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well first to even begin repairing the subway system you have to shut it down, which is a major inconvenience and the city loses tons of money from people missing work, tourists not commuting/traveling,etc. I'd rather not take a shot in the dark guess but I bet it's an incredibly high amount for each line that is closed or even altered.

Further, you have to consider that it's built on a foundation that is centuries old. Those tunnels are incredibly old and are built upon *other* tunnels. I can't imagine the amount of work that goes into keeping modern subways even remotely modern when they're built upon such crappy foundations.

Then of course you have lack of money, unforeseen issues (flooding, collapses, homeless, delays in construction schedule, etc.), the amount of red tape and the slow NYC bureaucracy is mind blowing as well. I'm surprised they're as nice as they are sometimes tbh.

This is all just a guess of course, I'm hardly knowledgeable on the topic.  </TEXT>

Summoning a succubus, or really any non-human being outside our realm, when you are not a full clairvoyant is incredibly dangerous and, in Buddhism at least, incredibly stupid. I believe Marcus Brody had some wise words on the subject, courtesy of Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade:

"You are meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend."

When somebody lives in poverty like that, it can go two ways. If the person is a natural occultist, like me (I lived in the homeless system for 4.5 years, no income for about 3.5 of them), they will come into their occult power and become very spiritually powerful but remain in material poverty, and be stripped of any physical gifts they once had so that all their resources are being invested in fueling the occult furnace. (I still have no income but I live with my parents now. **I'm living primarily through my energy body, so I don't leave the house or do physical tasks.**) 

What.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-05-07 18:33:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how malleable illusions works and further, the benefits of it- specifically how it relates to major image. 

Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spells normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion. 

For instance, does this mean that if an enemy sees through a major image illusion, I can use an action to craft a whole new major image illusion (the original disappearing of course) and they have to make a new investigation check?

Any help would be appreciated.  </TEXT>
