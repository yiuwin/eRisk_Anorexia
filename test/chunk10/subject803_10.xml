You absolutely should.

However, I think you should port your video to streamable for easier access (I wasn't able to access your video for some reason).

	<TEXT> Yeah he doesn't get it.

I feel like Digibro often jumps the gun when it comes to his decision to drop an anime.

Obviously it's his opinion, but I've always felt that a show needs around three episodes to understand it's main premise fully.

One of my favourite anime of this season (Rokudenashi) had a horrible first episode. If I had stopped there, I would be missing a really fun show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And that's the kind of person I am now. I don't trust anyone, especially guys, and especially "nice guys" who claim to have so much respect for women. 

I've been soul searching for a few years now.

I used to be the "nice guy".

I treated everyone with respect and had this bubbly and funny exterior I showed everyone. I would fall in love with every single woman who gave me an iota of attention....only to forget about them when we stopped contact.

It took me a long time to realise my actions were from my low self esteem and the feeling that I had nothing to offer anybody *but* my kindness.

I still fall into old habits, but I realise it comes off as disingenuous and it has mostly stopped.

I've had a lot of heartbreak in HS when genuine female friends would abandon their friendship with me due to suspicions of romantic feelings towards them and vice versa. Sadly, that pulled me further down the rabbit hole - drowning my sadness in food.


I'm not sure why I'm telling you this story, but I hope you trust again. </TEXT>

I love Colbert, but the majority of his monologue is focused on the jokes, while Seth explains the situation in detail with small jokes in between.

Colbert uses one small morsel of news (Spicer hiding in the bushes) and does a whole bit while Seth does a five second joke and moves on.

I like watching his *A Closer Look* segment and then watching Colbert's monologue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What about a system where a fan can pay money and they get a percentage of the total profit the anime got. It would replace the large companies who hire studios to create a series and would work like shares.

For example, a fan pays 100 dollars to fund a series.

The campaign makes 2-3 million dollars (highly ambitious).

Instead of shipping out merchandise, the fan gets the show he always wanted and 0.003-0.005 percent of the total profit (merchandise/BD). They would get the percentage of the amount they paid to make the anime possible (100 of 2-3 million)



Would that work?

Normally, an anime series is created to advertise the original material (LN/Manga).

The anime would then increase the number of readers, which is an indication of a show's success.

Which then poses the question, why isn't anime profitable on it's own?

I think anime is the only medium I know of that is made as an advertisement for the original material, rather than simply an adaption.

A show like Game of Thrones might've increased sales of the books - but that was not HBO's sole reason for making the show. 

This system means old/completed manga/LN will never see the light of day....since the priority is given to new material.

What would it take for anime to be profitable on it's own?

What I mean is, will there ever be a day when a studio could create an anime from an IP of their choosing - without worrying about the original material's sales? 

There are so many amazing LN/manga that have already completed their run but would be an amazing show if animated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like 90% of school romance (including harems) exists purely to let these Japanese otaku be able to project themselves into the role of the main character. The more confident and the stronger the personality of that character, the less likely that is.

Harem protagonists have always been an odd mix for me.
They act like badasses, can be clumsy at times, talk to women normally and flirt....but run away when the woman reciprocates.

Do Japanese Otaku like strong characters who constantly flirt with women, but get scared of women when they become interested?

Is the actual reciprocation where they draw the line?

This is an interesting topic I didn't give much thought.

	<TEXT> Its target audience is probably the average awkward otaku, so making it relatable will help them connect with the series which in turn means more sales of BD's and merchandise.

I don't really get that though.

Don't "average awkward otaku" want the protagonist to succeed so they can live vicariously through the character?

The anime protagonist here (Naoto) is gungho about his love for RyuZU and is never shy in showing it. The dude literally asked if she would marry him in the first few episodes.

The only complication that stalls their relationship is her designation as his "slave". Since she's an automata, RyuZU doesn't feel like she deserves his love. 

Would otaku be able to relate with a character like that? </TEXT>

We all know what could happen and what should happen but this is an anime not a hentai. Logic or the obvious is almost never used because that would end the story quicker. Go read some doujin

Kissing somebody is now hentai?

Also, why would the story end quicker, was the entire story revolved around this kiss?

Edit: Naoto is obsessed with RyuZU and loves her, but when she finally gives him permission - he runs away?

It's not even consistent with his character.

If he had been a shy protagonist, then I would understand his actions. However, this is a guy who is vocal about his love for her on multiple occasions (including this clip) and then acts all shy when she gives him permission to kiss her </TEXT>

It's 2017 and many new shows have forgone this particular trope (my favourite of them being Renai Boukun).

I was a very young child, but I still remember it like it was yesterday.

Everybody in the street froze, their eyes glued on the TV. My neighbours who wanted to migrate to America were crying.......it was extremely eerie, as if the world went into slow motion.

The people praying in the mosque increased, you could hear people saying "Ameen" as they prayed for the victims.

My father called us from Australia and told my mum that shortly after the attack, Sikh taxi drivers, Muslims and Arabs were getting constant abuse.

About a week later, we came back home - my parents were afraid that we wouldn't even be let in after what happened (we were African AND Muslim - a bad combination during that time). </TEXT>

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/02/jeff-sessions-and-the-russia-connection-what-happened-and-why-does-it-matter

Sessions lied under oath during his Senate confirmation hearing.

The investigation is still ongoing - which is why Sessions is under investigation yet again.

Why?

Sessions advised Trump to fire the man who is investigating the Russian connection. </TEXT>

Why did Sessions recuse himself then?

Why is there the possibility that he might even be disbarred?

Simple.

	<TEXT> They did want him fired, but it doesn't mean Trump's decision to fire Comey isn't extremely unacceptable.

The reason why he fired Comey doesn't make sense, since it was his investigation which caused him to win the presidency. Many people rightly believe that this has to do with the Russian investigation.

A president who fires someone investigating him and his constituents is bordering on totalitarianism

I didn't stop for BvS or SS, but I'm afraid I'll have to for WW.

I watched BvS and SS in the cinemas during the first week of their release - which helped me avoid any spoilers. 

I'm afraid that won't be the case for WW.

Due to university and life in general, I won't be able to watch the movie for two months or so......which is why I'm going dark.

It has been a pleasure discussing the DCEU with fans, I hope to see you on the other side.

Hope to see you sometime in August. </TEXT>

Absolutely, I haven't seen any of the other shows either. 

The connection is not even spoiler worthy, the OP of the main series is related to Kenshi - the protagonist of *War on Geminar*.

	<TEXT> [Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari) is a series composed of 13 OVA's, each episode reaching the 45 minute mark.

It's a spinoff/offshoot of [Tenchi Muyou! Ryououki](https://myanimelist.net/anime/539/Tenchi_Muyou_Ryououki)

I think the show is great and deserved a second season.

	<TEXT> But there are many DCEU fans out there who don't know this sub exists. What about them. How do we get them here?

Collaborating with the r/movies mods and adding a link to the subreddit in the discussion thread when WW and JL come out.

r/all is a cesspool and many subs hate attention from the main page.

Collaborating with subs focused on movies and cinematic universes is the way to go.

I found this subreddit after reading the comments of a ManofSteelAnswers video a year ago.

Before that, Youtube was the only place I could find DCEU news (I was not on reddit).

If you're commenting on another subreddit and the discussion has something to do with the DCEU, plug DC_Cinematic. There might be someone like me who'll find it... :D

I think 39,394 is a respectable number, the subscriber count should rise organically....the release of WW and JL will do this. </TEXT>

After picking up the series a few days ago, I have to say that I'm legitimately surprised I like it this much.

I mean, it's like every cop procedural - but it moves at a brisk pace.

Story lines that would take three seasons on a show like SVU - get resolved or escalate in one or two episodes.

Jennifer Lopez is also a surprisingly good actress.

	<TEXT> I'm not sure why you're obsessed with making something happen that isn't an imperative part of the comics. If the JL wants to get the UN's blessing on some stuff, then fine. I don't care. But if you're saying that they have to WORK for the UN or can only take action in conjunction with the UN, then that's just really retarded.

Had the DCEU focused on being a universe that mimics the comics - these issues wouldn't have any weight.

However - MoS, BvS and SS all discuss political ramifications....meaning they can't ignore it.

Snyder wanted a realistic universe? Well, in a realistic world - the JL wouldn't be able to operate without at least some form of acceptance from the UN.

I DID NOT SAY THE JL NEED TO GET PERMISSION FOR EVERYTHING THEY DO, I seriously don't know where you got that from.

The JL would work with the US and foreign governments to help people....they are not working **for** them!


And the JL members answer to each other (and ultimately Batman, since he's the guy with the contingency plans).

Batman would approve of some kind of control, he knows more than anyone - just how quickly things can turn.

Geez, I thought you said "Farewell" - why are you continuing this....you clearly don't agree with me. </TEXT>

There's also signs of dark magic and cults embedded into the story that prevents this from becoming a straight historical drama.

	<TEXT> Let me tell you something: If the UN had an agreement with Superman that he could only act when they said he could, and they told him that he couldn't go into North Africa to save Lois because of the implications of the civil war there, do you think he'd sit it out? Nope. He's going to do whatever he wants, regardless of what some dumb bureaucracy thinks.

What if Superman entering the territory means 20 thousand innocent civilians would die?

Superman might not listen, but the UN is there to ensure the JL could enter foreign territory without any issues.

The world is complicated

And the Injustice universe can happen in either of our scenarios, AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FICTION HERE. You can LITERALLY write whatever story you want.

Not when the DCEU is already established.

Can Zack Snyder replace Cyborg with a character that's half duck half human? YES.

Would it make sense? NO

They're going to do whatever they want anyway

What happens when "what they want" no longer aligns with the world?

hey are an entity that exists outside of politics. They're our modern day gods. They do what they want. And the people trust them because they've EARNED our trust

What the hell are you talking about?

Who's earned our trust?

They haven' even started working as the JL......

	<TEXT> The UN can't do shit to stop the JL. Fact. They literally CANNOT act as a "check" against the JL.

It's the facade that matters.

The US can bomb any country with a nuclear bomb...but they don't.

It's the illusion of control, which would calm down numerous countries and prevent another Cold War.

The UN is a political check, not a physical one...I seriously don't know where you got the weird idea that ordinary humans could control metahumans...... *cough* *cough* **Suicide Squad**

You know how we know the JL can act in good faith? Because it's a fictional story with fictional characters about superheroes. They can do whatever they write them to do.

Yeah.......the JL can act in good faith, but it's bad writing to act as if the entire world just doesn't exist.

The JL is like the Olympic Pantheon. We live and die by their will. Luckily for us, they're on our side.

They are not gods (except WW), we don't live and die by their will.

Your way of thinking is basically creating the Injustice universe.....a world where the JL **can't** be trusted.

That "useless" organisation and it's predecessor are the reason we live in a relatively peaceful time.

Without the UN's supervision, the JL is an American metahuman group that has absolutely no leash.

This will cause unnecessary worry and unrest......

The world will stop caring about Nuclear arms and a Metahumans race will begin, as each country develops a group of their own.

I's not only about transparency, they need to show the world that they do not prioritise the US and that they would help save people...regardless of politics.



I don't know what world you live in, but a group of highly dangerous individuals without a leash is scarier than a nuclear threat.
