	<TEXT> My friend,
it's really nice that you found a girl :)
Have you tried to contact her again and explain why you drank beforehand?
If she was interested, she would listen

You seem like a cool, smart guy, the kind of guy people like to befriend. Scars heal quickly with Bio-oil. Death is never the way out my friend. Please live on, I promise you it will get better. Life is a rollercoaster of highs and lows, and if you've been experiencing a lot of lows, I can guarantee that you that the highs will come soon.

I wish you all the best in life :) btw, if you're interested in music, you should listen to City   Colour. It's sad music, but it's beautiful and meaningful and I think you can identify with him :) Good luck and best wishes 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend,
I see you're sad, but I would certainly not say you're a loser. I know people who see themselves as great people who are much less reflected than you. You seem to understand a lot more than most, and that I must respect, but it seems dumb losing someone like you. We need people like you :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi friend,
you don't need to tell anyone :)
either way, it is nothing wrong with owning a dog for that reason either. It's okay to be depressed and lonely, I'm just really glad you found help.
Cheers from Norway :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When talking about drugs, if you're willing to break the law;
maybe it will get better if you try marijhuana.

I haven't tried it myself as I'm not depressed, but I would surely recommend it if you haven't tried. </TEXT>
