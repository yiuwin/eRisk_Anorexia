	<TEXT> Thanks! I hope it works out. I told myself I've never touch xanax but now that I'm on a dose that actually helps and not abusing it, my anxiety has basically shut the fuck up, haha. I have incredibly severe anxiety and I didn't realize how bad it was until I started medication for it. But my BPI and schizoaffective never let up, so here we go with the game of which medication will it be this time? Haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been unmedicated for two years now and this is actually the best I've felt in a long time, so I'm hoping after a week or so I'll be able to gauge how I'm really gonna do on it, but didn't know if this was common once starting it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Abilify... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-03 16:06:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Soo, after a nervous breakdown and psychotic break, I've ended up on xanax and Abilify.
I was abusing the xanax for weeks but am now down to 2.5mg a day and it has been my fucking lifesaver, but obviously didn't control my BPI or schizoaffective symptoms so my pdoc threw in 2mg Abilify and I started it on Monday at bedtime. I take it with .5mg of xanax.
But I've noticed that if it weren't for the xanax to calm me down and make me somewhat sleepy, I'd be completely fucking wired on just the Abilify.
I wake up in the morning almost hypomanic and it calms down once I take my morning meds but damn, my mind won't stop, I need to do a million things all the sudden, and mouth won't stay shut. But the xanax is evening it out for the most part.
I'll be titrating up to 5mg of Abilify in the following weeks so what I'm wondering is if anyone else had this issue and whether side effects lessened after a couple weeks or whatever.
Just a little note, I abused my xanax prescription for a few weeks and was taking up to 3.5mg a day and pretty much suddenly dropped to 2.5 cause I was running low and thought I'd had enough to get me through until I got my refill and talked to my pdoc but I ran out and went through full blown withdrawal for 24 hours and they were pretty sure I was on the brink of having a seizure. So, I found out the 2.5mg works great for me and my pdoc said it's making me eat, gain weight, keeping my stress levels down which in turn lessens my physical conditions and I'm able to cope and function. 
I WILL NEVER ABUSE XANAX AGAIN. Last Monday was the worst day of my life and I apparently have more luck than I thought cause out of every single patient my pdoc sees, I am THE ONLY ONE, literally, that she prescribes xanax to. I will never take advantage of that again, I just want to get better.
The Abilify and xanax are working wonders already, I'm just wondering if these wired, hypomanic feelings will eventually subside.
Thanks guys!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First time post here, hopefully this is the appropriate place. 
I'm prescribed .5mg xanax and have taken 3mg within the past 24 hours (very very bad day, only thing I had on hand to help) but I'm laying in bed with abdominal pain (I have certain health conditions so this occurs normally) but it's not easing up and have some lemon kush I hang onto for situations like this as its helped my pain immensely before, but I'm wondering if even one hit of the blunt will completely mess me up cause of the xanax. It's been almost six hours since I took the xanax but I'm curious if anyone could give me any advice or insight.  </TEXT>

I'm being scoped, biopsied, and tested out of every end cause they think I have Crohn's or UC and it's just my luck this would happen so close to the procedure I've needed for over a year now :( All of these appointments, meds, tests, procedures, ugh...I just wanna curl up into a ball and disappear :(

Meds - prilosec, propranolol, bentyl, xanax, penicillinVK, depo shot, and Excedrin as needed. 
Conditions - paroxysmal tachycardia, IBS, GERD, endometriosis, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder. 
Exactly a week ago I broke off half of one of my top left molars (#14) and found it to be completely infected and abscessed. I went to the ER within four hours, got antibiotics and pain killers, took my first dose in the ER that night and only had to take one of the norco as the pain is gone.
Saw my dentist yesterday, referred me to an oral surgeon, I go in tomorrow at 9:30am to have it extracted. They do not put people under or use any kind of sedation, just numb you. 
My question is, will I be able to drive myself home? I have no one to take me and it's about 50 minutes away but I've never had anything like this done before.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...fucked up. 
These past two months I've been dealing with some pretty serious medical stuff, I'm scheduled for an EGD and colonoscopy on the 22nd and they believe I have Crohn's or UC. 
Awesome! I've been battling this illness for almost two years and finally one of our top state university hospital is taking me serious. I mean, you'd think weighing 100lbs and shitting blood would have warranted this soon enough, right? Nope.
I'm bipolar I, schizoaffective, and have severe anxiety, so I've been told this has been all in my head for two years now. 
I've been unmedicated for my bipolar, schizoaffective, and anxiety cause everything fucks up my stomach, so the episodes, psychotic breaks, rage, and self-destruction hit their lowest point a couple weeks ago. 
I tried to carve my forearm open with a screwdriver and tried to swallow all of my pills. I hadn't eaten a single bite of food in a week, was running on 10-12 hours of sleep during this week and a half, so I snapped. I was hallucinating, in a different world, I felt like I was watching myself on a TV show or something. I was gone, my mind had checked out.  Then one night, my fianc had to physically restrain me in a chokehold on the ground because I blacked the fuck out and became violent. He and my mom almost called an ambulance but they got me calmed down. 
I saw a GI specialist last week, reassured me that anxiety plays a major part in what's wrong with me but my bipolar disorder is not the root of my problems and basically said the other doctors should eat shit for neglecting me cause I'm mentally ill. 
Now, here's my fuck up. I've had a bottle of .50mg xanax (completely untouched) from a hospitalization in August 2013. I was in the hospital little over a week ago cause I was so physically ill and just ready to die in all honesty.
They gave me IV diludid and for the first time in months my pain was gone. Mind you, I haven't taken one narcotic even when I truly needed it in over two years. I felt so much better after that, the fluids, and a couple other things pushed through my IV but the Benadryl they gave me left me jittery, crawling out of my skin, and I couldn't sleep. So, I took my first xanax in years. 
Hah, bad idea. 
One pill helped at first, but within the almost two weeks of this hospital visit, I'm taking up to 6-8 xanax a day along with my pain killers. I remember why I vowed to never touch this shit again, cause I can't function on a daily basis now without popping 2-4 xanax without waking up then mixing it with my other meds. 
I fucking missed being high and now remember why I never wanted to get clean. Here's the other dilemma- Im becoming manic due to all of this. 
It's better than depression but fuck me, what have I done?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So if anyone has read my posts as of late, you'll know I've been going through some serious medical issues.
WELL, I finally saw a GI at OSU Wexner Medical Center (if you live in Ohio, you know who they are and they rank up there with the Mayo Clinic) and I left the office crying.
CAUSE I WAS HAPPY. 
I was treated so well, had the most thorough exam ever, saw the attending, and I'm set up for a colonoscopy and endoscopy at the same time on December 22nd. He also ordered many customs labs including food intolerances, celiac disease, cortisol/adrenal function, ANA which is to check for almost all autoimmune diseases, and they will be checking my heart before I'm put under for my procedure. I'll be put almost completely under and it'll be a little heavier than normal due to both scopes being done at once and they're biopsying as much as they can. 
So, here's my main point. Now, normal me would have been like "is that going to make me vomit?" or "is this going to make me nauseous and throw-up?" I didn't ask those questions once, nor did it cross my mind. I know the bowel prep has about a 60-70% chance of making me vomit but you guys, I DON'T CARE! 
Holy shit, I can honestly say I'm not worried. If this was a month or so ago, I'd be freaking out about it constantly. But some way, somehow, actually being sick and being faced with crippling pain and nausea every single day for over a month has almost helped me get over this phobia. The more I worry, the sicker I get. The more upset I get, the more blood I shit. 
I cannot let this rule my life anymore. I don't know whether to call this a blessing in disguise or what, but I feel almost freed. 
Don't get me wrong, it's not completely gone and I'm not "cured" but I finally found my sliver of hope to hang on to and wanted to share it with you guys since you've all been some of the only support I've had and I thank you :)
Here's to hoping having my backside violated will yield the answer to this damn mystery illness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of people with Crohn's and UC have negative stool tests and their blood work is fine, but yet are still having horrible symptoms. Colonoscopy/endoscopy/pill cam really get to the bottom of it all and they usually take biopsies during the procedures. I was told Crohn's can only really be definitively diagnosed through a biopsy they take during scopes. 
A lot of times a CT w/contrast will show things like inflammation, strictures, blockages, or even diverticulosis. That's how my mom and fianc found out they had diverticulitis, the active infection in the pockets.  
I'm in the process of figuring out whether I have UC or Crohn's but wont know until I have scopes in the next couple of weeks and the biopsies come back.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been so sick (physically) that I haven't been able to keep my appointments with my pdoc and therapist, and they know why, so once I'm not as physically sick I'll be seeing them again. Up until Tuesday, I've basically been bedridden for almost three weeks, spending copious amounts of time in the bathroom and in so much pain all I could do was cry. Even a few sips of water had me on the toilet for ten minutes :( So any appointment like that (let alone leaving the house at all) was kinda out of the question :/
I have bipolar I, anxiety/panic disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, so I've seen different types of therapists and the same psychologist for almost 7 years. But I've been in touch with them and they're aware of what's been going on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been suffering from an unknown type of IBD, so I'm seeing a GI at a university hospital next week to get tests set up and figure it out. 
In the meantime, I'm on pain killers and xanax, due to having a nervous breakdown last week, ending up in the hospital in so much pain and barely able to keep water down. I was loaded up on dialudid and zofran, so I was flying high. It was the first night of relief I've had in over a month. 
Years ago I abused drugs such as xanax and opiates, so thats why I've refused them for over two years, up until Monday night. 
For the first time in years, I was worry free. Vomiting was not on my mind, hell, nothing was on my mind for once. I just wanted to sleep cause I was so sleep deprived I was almost hallucinating. I didn't eat a single bite of food for over a week, and once again fucked my body and exacerbated my condition with my anxiety and neglected my body. I was 100lbs. during my admission and I'm 5'8". 
Tuesday morning when I got home, I was crawling out of my skin and jittery due to the Benadryl they pushed through my IV (I have allergic reactions to contrast dye) so...I popped a xanax and FINALLY, fucking finally, my mind shut down, my stomach quit bothering me, and I had my first good nights sleep. 
Well, almost a week later and where am I now? Constantly popping xanax and pain killers to stay high and keep the intrusive thoughts out. It feels amazing. My emetophobia has shut the fuck up, I don't think about vomiting, if I get anxious, nervous, or nauseous I pop a xanax and away they go. I'm taking upwards of 5-8 a day, just in this past week and even have a joint in my bedroom for when I want it. 
So what's my point here? I traded one evil for another because I let this get way too out of control. I thought I could fix my mind myself and no, I can't. Where am I now? Once again developing an addiction to drugs but if I let those go, the emetophobia comes back. 
My fianc and I haven't been fighting cause I'm just fucked up all the time and it's a break from this nightmare of this past month. I love feeling nothing for once and could give a shit less what happens at this point. 
Only plus side, I cannot quit eating. Holy shit. I have gained almost 10lbs this week alone. 
I guess I just need to get this all out and warn you guys, meds may help you, you may think they're your saving grace, but I have please, just seek the proper treatment, help, and only use these fucking medications as a last resort. I just wanted to share this in hopes of shining some more light on the consequences of not seeking the proper treatment.
I'll somehow get out of this, its going to take plenty of treatment and time, but I have no choice but to claw my way out of this grave I've dug myself.
Edit: words... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey! Sorry for the delay in updating, the hospital I went to Friday night didn't do crap so I ended up at one of Ohios bigger hospitals and they took great care of me :) 
I got IV fluids, dilaudid, two doses of zofran, Protonix, and Benadryl. The dilaudid definitely fucked me up but took away my pain almost immediately. I had a CT with oral contrast and couldn't finish it all cause I almost vomited from it but I got enough down to light my insides up, haha. Everything so far has come back looking fine but they know I'm not and still think it could be crohn's or colitis so I'm seeing a GI in a week. So I'll be prepping for an endoscopy/colonoscopy here soon, but it'll be worth it in the end :) 
I actually woke up feeling quite a bit better today, some residual pain and slight queasiness but I took some dicyclomine and it's helping. I was able to get down a cup of chicken broth so that's a big deal, haha. 
I'm just ready to figure this out and take care of it already. I'm down to 100lbs and it's disgusting. 
Edit: Also, xanax is a lifesaver. My anxiety has been making this so much worse but I'm at the point now that I'm used to being nauseous but the less I focus on it, the less I fear vomiting. If its going to happen, it's gonna happen. I'm sick and there's nothing I can do right now to really control it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been sick for over three weeks with some of the worst nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, fever, bleeding, and sort of vomiting and just saw a new GP Wednesday who ran blood tests, but wanted to get the rest of my medical records to review before anything else.
We're pretty sure I have peptic/duodenal ulcers or Crohn's and nothing at all is helping. I'm down to 101lbs. and can barely drink sprite without it trying to come back up. Phenergan and Zofran only help for a little bit if I take them within two hours of each other and Pepto helps the god awful gnawing and burning for maybe 30 minutes, but I've gotten too sick to ride it out.
So, my fianc is taking me to the hospital and demanding they figure this out. So what am I scared of? 
Actually vomiting. 
Yeah, out of all things this is what's giving me anxiety. I'm scared the meds they'll give me will make me sick, I'm scared of an NG tube, and I'm scared something is blocked/ruptured/perforated and that vomiting is inevitable. 
What the fuck is wrong with me? I could be bleeding internally and these are my thoughts. 
Please keep your fingers crossed for me, I need as much luck and good vibes as I can get. I'm really scared guys.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been on the depo for 8 years and have had great success with it. A month or so after my first shot I began having unprotected sex with my boyfriend (whom is now my fianc:) ) and have never had any pregnancy scares or issues.
But /u/sunnyderp is right, condoms are always a good idea if you're so unsure. Everyone is different so it's better to be safe than sorry :) Just make sure to get that shot ON TIME! You'll have a two week window in which you can get it but it's best to get it the day it's due, and if you don't, use condoms. Plus most doctors offices usually do a pregnancy test before giving your your injection.  </TEXT>

Pepto is taking my symptoms away almost completely (nausea included) and the burning, acidic, gnawing pain is gone and I've been munching on toast, pretzels, crackers, and ramen all night :) My mom has ulcers and it just dawned on us that this is what happens to her, so I picked up pepcid, tums, and more Pepto to hopefully start healing it if thats what it is. Here's to hoping! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I think we've narrowed it down - pretty sure I've got an ulcer :( I took some Pepto earlier and in under five minutes, I felt sooo much better. I thought I was just having really bad heartburn/indigestion lately but I've been under so much stress and eating NSAIDS like candy (endometriosis pain) and just tried to ignore it the burning, pain, discomfort, crazy indigestion coupled with actually almost vomiting that I fucked myself :( I got some pepcid, tums, and some more Pepto and they are actually taking my nausea away almost completely. I'm gonna keep my fingers crossed I can keep it under control :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I unfortunately do suffer from IBS and I think it's what the issue is :( All tests and xrays showed was gas buildup and some constipation. They gave me another script for antiemetics and I picked up some Gas-x and Miralax, hopefully it helps!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welp, I'm full of shit and gas! Haha! As stupid as it sounds, I'm relieved knowing my blood work and everything was fine and it's nothing serious. The nausea has been so unbearable that it freaked me out. 
I've had Phenergan at home but they gave me another at the hospital and a script for some more until I feel better.
Thank you so much for the kind words and support! I'm going to make it through this, as always, and keep on keepin' on :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, since Monday I've been dealing with actual HORRIBLE nausea, I have actually almost vomited. The closest I've come in years and I finally chalked it up to being really constipated. My bowels have not been right here lately and TMI - but I'm not able to pass anything but water right now and I feel so full and bloated, it doesn't feel productive at all. 
I've eaten once since Sunday and that was only cause I had a hypoglycemic episode. 
I've been upping my water intake, drinking apple juice, and even drinking hot water. 
Tonight, I'm spiking a fever, I feel like I can't even pass gas, and my right side is starting to hurt really bad. 
I'm on my way to the hospital but I'm so fucking terrified it's appendicitis, a complete obstruction, or something worse. 
I haven't felt this sick in a long time and I'm scared :( 
I really hope it's something easily taken care of, I'm having a panic attack right now. I guess I just needed to vent and get this off my chest. 
Keep your fingers crossed for me :(    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just added an edit cause I'm apparently an idiot and didn't even check when my last injection was :(
But thank you! I've never had any issues like this so I kinda freaked myself out.  </TEXT>
