	<TEXT> I was doing some reading into the rule of Chiang's GMD and his rule over China, especially when compared to Sun Yat-Sen, and I wanted to find an example of his changes from the social democratic style of Sun's to Chiang's authoritarian style of rule. Does anyone know where I can find Chiang's speeches on the matter?
Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, the problem with this achievement is you have to go down Historical Focus or Britain will do Scan. intervention, but then Germany will get its Scandinavian focus. The only way I managed to avoid (after I got the achieve I wanted to keep playing) was to declare vs. The soviets and then Non Aggression Germany. Unlucky. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People who use their sexuality as their definition I dislike. Quite frankly I dislike bringing it up unless I feel comfortable about talking about it because it's a personal aspect to my life. 
The fact that you might be gay, bi, pan etc. shouldn't be what you use as a cornerstone for your actions. Yes, be proud about it, but don't be pretentious.

	<TEXT> I think what everyone fails to realise is that we should respect opinions as long as they aren't actively harming anyone or being imposed on anyone. Politically I disagree with Trump, and I'll disagree with what a trump supporter might say if we get in a political discussion, but that's it. 
I'll never look down on someone if they have a different belief to me as long as it isn't actively harmful.
But everyone, regardless of affiliation politically, should learn that someone does not have to agree with you.

edit: don't fight here. go take it somewhere else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favourite avenged song, this is to me the pinnacle of the band.
(The end repeat) Cry alone, I've gone awayyyyy no more nightsss no more pain.
The middle bit, when the 'no more breath' part starts, or just before that. 
The best, as started before.
I know this song is about suicide and it's a very touchy issue, and I don't condone it, but it's still incredible.
10/10. </TEXT>

I FEEELL THAT TIMMMEEE PASSSSESSS BYYYY.
The buildup to that bit about 2/3 through, because that's just so perfect. 
2nd best song of the album, in my top 5 of all avenged songs. 
Don't care about the vibe or the meaning, I'll keep listening until I'm gone in the black of the night.
10/10.

	<TEXT> This one's got a special place in my heart. First song I ever listened to by them on a suggestion by my sister. A good one, but an overrated one.
'When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall'
The drumming is just so good, especially between vocals.
Probably about 3/4th down, there are underrated songs in WtF that are better.
That blend of vocals which bring more mediocracy from the harsh sandpaper of Sounding shows the change of focus of the band for their new music going forward, and I support it.
