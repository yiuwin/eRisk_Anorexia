	<TITLE> A few questions after a bad car ride. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Recently I started a 5.5 planted tank with Fluval Shrimp Stratum. I don't have any animals because I'm still working on a fishless cycle. I made a bit of a slope on one end and I had it supported with rocks underneath the substrate. 
Today I had to transport the tank on a 3 hour drive. I took out about 85% of the water and I strapped it in my passenger seat. I could not have driven more carefully but my tank was not recognizable after the trip. The rocks moved around way too much and now I'm re-scaping my tank. 
Before the trip my water was completely clear, but after the trip it's become really bad. I've sifted the substrate with cold water multiple times now, but that only seems to make it worse.

Is there anything I can do besides capping the substrate to save it? 

Is it safe to use my CO2 diffuser while the water is so dirty? https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004GCO35G

Will my double sponge filter help, or should I let the tank sit still? 

Next time I'm going to make sure that the width of my tank is parallel to the length of my car. 

Should I drain more water or less next time?

 Do you guys have any other trips for transporting a small tank?

	<TITLE> [TOMT][Song] A song named after a girl with a hispanic name. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think I remember the band being indie/pop/rock. 

The rest of the songs on the album were in English, but this one was in Spanish (it may have had some English). It's a long song, and it kinda sounds like two different songs put together. It may even have a pause in the middle. The name "Alejandria" comes to mind, but I haven't been able to find anything. 

For some reason I remember the name being one or two letters from being another very common hispanic female first name. 

I think I remember the album art being green or yellow.  </TEXT>

http://www.unicycle.com/unicycles/commuter-touring/trainer-29-inch-unicycle.html

I've only ever had an 18". I'll be using it mostly to ride across campus. My furthest class is 1/2 mile away. My questions are:

Will I save time over walking?
Should I avoid non-paved paths?
Should I lock it up outside on a bike rack while I'm in class? 

Any other related tips are appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

I'd like to set up a profile to automatically start recording video when I enter my car. 

I've done this before. I used Daily Roads Voyager. I don't like how clunky and ugly the app is, and it doesn't work well with tasker. 

Is there another app with tasker capabilities that can record video? </TEXT>
