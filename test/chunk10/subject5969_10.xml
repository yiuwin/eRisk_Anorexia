	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Had a chance to watch Silence and Hacksaw Ridge recently. Liked both of them though felt Silence was a better film. Hacksaw have way too much over the top mind numbing pornographic violence.

Anyway couldnt help notice both movies starred Andrew Garfield  as a character with Pro-Christian beliefs[in silence he is a Christian missionary while in Hacksaw Ridge he plays a Christian Pacifist] and both films have the Japanese as the antagonist.

Was curious to know why did Andrew sign up for both of these films at same time? Shouldnt he have either backed out of one of the two projects or inform the producers about it so that they could have cast someone else instead of him? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bet there is atleast 1 billion hours worth of tv shows and movies out there and I doubt it any of us will be able to watch all of it in one life time. Maybe it will be a good idea they just drastically reduce the number of movies and tv shows so that once content is less most of us will get time to catch up lots of quality shows and movies which we missed earlier but didnt bother watching because some new stuff gets released. Some of us who go to theatres to watch movies will save money on overpriced tickets.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saw LA LA Land in theatre today. Like many moviegoers I too fell for the hype and hoopla about this film and went to see it with lots of expectations.

The first 20 or 30 minutes was quite good but slowly it started to get boring and repetitive. The Piano bit played by Ryan Reynolds character was nice to listen to the first time but they kept repeating it so many times throughout that you start to get annoyed after sometime.  By

Now in case some of you start pouncing on me let me mention I have seen quite a number of Hollywood musicals. Singing in the rain, Sound of Music, My Fair lady, are some of the greats from the Golden age of Hollywood and amongst recent ones Chicago, Dreamgirls, Burlesque come to mind and I must say this doesnt match upto any of them. 

As far as I am concerned this is an average musical and and not that great like the critics are making it out to be

	<DATE> 2016-12-23 14:03:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hollywood execs somehow think the average moviegoer loves movies filled with tonnes of visual effects and cgi [whether they are relevant to the plot of not]  and the reason why almost every big budget movie released over the past 10 years had so much of vfx and cgi in them. Blame fast computers and advanced vfx software for it which makes it easy for a team of like 100 or 1000 vfx artists to render vfx crap onto all of us! In the good old days before computers became mainstream, special effects were   done the good old way and it lots of time and effort and hence a big budget visual effects filled blockbuster a rarity and almost special event every year!  

My gripe really isnt about the vfx in movies but about more about how rampant it has become that almost every big budget hollywood movie has it in them. 

ok I am done </TEXT>
