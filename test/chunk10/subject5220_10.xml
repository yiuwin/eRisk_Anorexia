	<TEXT> As a kid, I wrote many notes to future owners of the house (or whoever found the note), along with a few random items (coins from my motley collection of old currency - nothing special, just cheap foreign coins I found at jumble sales), or the occasional small toy. I used to wrap the note and gifts up in a plastic bag, and then post them through gaps between floorboards, holes in the wall, and other random places throughout the house. 

Hopefully a kid found them, if anyone :-)  </TEXT>

He was a carpenter, and had accidentally chopped off his hand whilst working with a circular saw.

	<TEXT> That's the weird thing: whilst you can see the edge when in poly select mode, when in edge select mode I just couldn't select that edge running along the long side of that triangle. I ended up deleting both triangles, and recreating the quad.

Yes, I did extrude the shape from a some lines I attached together. It resulted in a non-standard poly which I then needed to cut up into different quads. Oddly, 3 of the quads were created fine, just the last one that was created with these triangles (same on the top of the extruded shape as the bottom too, in case this helps).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've not encountered the connect tool yet, just working through some tutorials to get the basics. Will probably come across this in due course!

It's weird, because using the cut tool, it definitely brought up the snap cursor, so I would have expected it to automatically start the cut from the existing vertex, but I can see that this problem could arise easily by creating an extra vertex by mistake. Definitely something to look out for. 

What would connect be used for typically, does it just automatically create an edge between two selected vertices?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Are you doing this in a in edit poly modifier?

I selected the modify tab, and the used the cut tool. Is this what you mean? 

 Sometimes, you might need to check if your "cut", perhaps didn't really connect to the correct vertex. Try single-clicking on your corner vertices and try dragging them, are there any duplicate verts floating around? If so, delete them or merge them to the other verts.

Yep, I tried grabbing and dragging the vertices, but there was definitely only one there! 

 Are any smoothing groups set to the face?
 Every quad will always be made of 2 polygons. Even though you might not see the edge lines. (you can use 'turn' in edge-mode to flip them over)

This sounds like it might have been it - I'll try and re-create it. I can see the 'turn' option now in the Edges section. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Using 'cut' to breakdown an ngon into quads, I find that when i switch to face mode to select the new 4 sided faces, there are instead two triangles as per [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ZgbQnAB.png) 

The highlighted areas are where I've created cut the edges, from corner to corner. 

I got around this by deleting both triangle faces, selecting the border edges and capping them to fill the hole - which created a 4 sided poly as expected. 

I can't understand why max is creating these 3 triangle polys on certain faces for me? There wasn't an edge running down the middle of them, and there were no extra vertices that I could find. I really just want to know what is happening so I can stop it happening in the future!

(I'm a complete beginner to Max btw, but have a bit of Maya experience) </TEXT>
