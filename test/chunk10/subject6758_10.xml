	<TEXT> I've begun to notice a pattern on Reddit. Donald Trump does something scandalous, it's posted on r/news and a few minutes later an anti Trump meme is posted.

Not complaining though, these memes are hilarious.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like it will only work if the protester needs to live. The question popped into my mind whilst I was watching the movie "Suffragette" in class today. In the later part of the movie one of the characters are incarcerated and she goes on a hunger strike. However, the warden and a few guards pin her down and force feed her and whilst the scene was happening I kept thinking "why not just ignore her?". Now I know that it's about her martyrdom and dying for a cause will only strengthen it and blah blah blah you get the picture. So your comment about inmates was perfect.

	<TEXT> It's a brilliantly written World War II documentary and I would love to re watch it. However, I have been unable to find a full episode, only [this](http://www.wildbear.tv/work/world-war-ii-the-price-of-empire/) trailer.

	<TEXT> If, for example a person hunger strikes as a protest against a government, why not simply ignore hunger strikers and let them starve themselves until they either die or give up? </TEXT>
