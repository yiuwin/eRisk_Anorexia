	<TEXT> Both exhaust and ignite are tools to make your laning dueling stronger, if you don't want more kill potential and prefer to create pressure around the map take tp. 

Exhaust is for oponents that rely to all-in you and don't have ways of scaping. Irelia is the perfect example, she will wait till your health is slightly higher than hers, stun you and smash the keyboard, if you take that away from her with a well timed Exhaust she will die 90% of the times. Also take into account that most of these champions are really  bad when behind, so killing them in lane will hurt them really bad. Renekton, Irelia, Xin zaho, Yasuo (if he doesn't have minions behind)

Ignite is when you need kill potential and your oponent has a lot of healing, these champions are also super weak to the Lyandries %health burn, so Ult+DFT+Lyandri+Ignite will just shred Mundo, Swain, Warwick, Vladimir and the like. </TEXT>

If you can, try to push them so far that they can't even win the minion experience and farm with your e.

	<TEXT> Spaniard here, healthcare is public, even for foreigners, which can lead to some... curious situations, that really show you the problem with private health systems.

I remember one day, years ago, where my father (doctor) had to take care of me because nobody else could, he had to work but the hospital director was fine with me being there, pretty cool guy.

So this young woman enters, and even with 10 years I can see she is super anxious. She is limping, so my father asks if she comes for her leg. She nods, my father tells her to sit, and after she has he starts checking her leg. He tries to speak with her but her spanish is really bad and it's hard to understand her. He says that it seems pretty bad and that she has probably broken her leg, but that he is going to do an X-Ray test to be sure.

So her face turns blank, and freezes for some seconds, and then stands up and tries to exit. My father blocks her way and tells her that it's going to be ok and that it won't hurt (he thought she was scared of the X-Rays) but the woman doesn't listen and basically freaks out and tries to scape. But instead she falls to the ground because of her broken leg, she starts crying and pleads to let her go. It took half an hour to make her understand that she didn't have to pay for the X-Ray test, the plaster or any treatment. She didn't have the money to pay the usual fees of those in her country (I think it was the USA) and that's why she had tried to scape, I knew how public healthcare worked (my father lived from it) and I remember asking her why people in her country didn't just pay it together. I made her cry for a second time. I still feel bad about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Go to your bathroom, take your clothes off, and look at yourself in the mirror. This is you, its the result of billions of years of constant evolution, look. Every curve, no matter how small, every inch of your soft skin, your face, look at your eyes, your breasts, look at your hands, your fingers, how are they? Small and cute? Fatty and chubby? Just normal fingers?

Thats you, and that alone makes It beautiful, because you are a beautiful person.

The idea of "beauty" is only defined by the society we live in. Ever heard of the Miro Venus? That was beauty 10.000 years ago. I am not laughing at the "dumb primitives", that woman was a goddess and every other woman wanted to be like her, she was a top model and if I had lived 10.000 years ago I would totally have wanted to fuck her.

I am a guy with multiple health disorders, the one that has been the hardest to deal with is that my body is very inneficient at creating and storing fat and muscles. Everyone in my family is 1'80 m tall (sorry, I'm european), while I am 1'60. I can't get fit, no matter how hard I burn myself in the gym. If a take my shirt off you can see my ribs when I am standing in a normal position, I am all bones and skin. When I went to donate blood some months ago, the doctor told me that I was at the verge of not being a suitable donator, because my weight was so low that it almost wouldnt be safe for me, I only passed because my emoglobine levels were super high.

Guys are supposed to be high and strong, I look like a 16 year old (its not nice to be asked If you are an adult and having to show my ID every time I go to vote). My face is full of achne, my hair gets super grasy, no matter what products I use to clean It. My body hair is off the charts, and if i was taller I could be an okey bigfoot. My legs are twisted and will probably give me tons of problems as I age. Dont even get me started on my penis, because nowdays men need to affirmate themselves with sexuality, in fact, thats one of the reasons for most rapers to me male. But this is me.

I just feel this is me, it feels good to move my fingers, to touch my face, to smile, I like laying in a bigass armchair we have at home and curling into a ball, It feels so damm confortable, I like running, even if I get tired in seconds because I can't do It properly with my legs, jumping, dancing... I just feel... In control, this is my body, I didn't choose it, but its fine, because this me, and I like myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuck you Miyazaki. FUCK. YOU.

I could deal with Sif fighting until his last breath to protect the honor of his master and die a worthy death.

When I saw the mountains of corpses under New Londo, I said to myself that life is a bitch and kept going.

Seath was a mad villain and I was fine with him losing the grip of reality and transforming people into wicked monsters with his cruel experiments, because he paid for It, and got what he deserved.

Watching the great Knight Artorias go Hollow hit me like a truck, but I later knew he had sacrificed for what he considered a greater good, his death had a purpose, he lived up to his legend.

At the point of reaching lost Izalith and learning that this had been caused by a desperate attempt to make the first flame last longer, turning everyone into mindless demons I was almost crushed, asking myself WHY, why all the pain, why all the lost lives and beauty, why mankinds struggle couldn't do an inch to heal the world. I meet Solaire, and I could see that he had endured a similar travel. I felt some sort of vague happiness, at least, sunbro could understand me, and if he kept giving his all, even with a shroud of darkness around his hearth, I had no excuse to try any less.

And then... I found that cursed corridor.

FUCK YOU MIYAZAKI.

WHY?

You could take anyone, anything, in any conceibible way, and It wouldnt have hurt me a fraction of this. Solaire, motherfucking Solaire, the guy who would always cheer me up and help me overcome any challenge, dies the most stupid and meaningless death in the whole series, a fucking maggot. And the worst part of this is that he dies BECAUSE he was this beautiful and optimistic person, the best parts of a person turned into his downfall, he died BECAUSE he never gave up to find his own Sun.

I just... Fuck, I dont know why even try anymore, how can hope remain, in a world that has lost its Sun? </TEXT>

So a nurse enters his room all mad shouting: Who the fuck is smoking in a room! You better stop or the visit ends right now!

Then she saw that he was alone and just froze there. After 10 seconds or so she recomposes and yells him to stop RIGHT NOW. My uncle's response:

	<TEXT> Babies are a LOT smarter than adults. They have to understand that certain noises are used as a means of comunicacin, and understand a whole language, just by listening and watching. Its mind blowing, they have no prior reference or comparison, just hear sounds, and associate each unit of sound with a concept including abstract ones, and then figure out that some words have no meaning and are merely used to link other words who do have meaning. They discover gravity, how It works, mirrors (a lot of animals cant figure out that they are seeing themselves), and a ton of other things, all while learning to control their body, which is really hard, ask people with disabilities who recovered their motor functions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sup, I play gp every now and then when I need to blow up the enemy team with fat damages, mainly the 50/50 build. With the new tems...

Is GA better than last whisper tems now? When should I buy It? After Ghostblade? Or will that slow down my damage too much?

New Steraks, thoughts? Doesn't seem that good to me.

New Death's dance? I think It has some potential with the 30 damage "reduction".

What zeal tem should i take now?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, as you said, there are lots of beautiful people out there... But not as many who can be supportive, caring or whatever good trait you have, focus on those, because thats what really matters.
