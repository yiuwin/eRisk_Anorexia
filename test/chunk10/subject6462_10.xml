It's getting harder to restrict on the weekends with my boyfriend, and honestly I don't even *want* to do it anymore. I don't like lying to him about why I'm not eating, and I've noticed that when I eat less he does too (which he absolutely shouldn't, considering he's 6'1" and already on the lower end of his healthy weight range). 

Going forward I plan to eat 800 calories M-F (with a split of 40% Protein, 35% Fat and 25% Carbs) and 1800 on Saturday and Sunday. I'm scared to go that high but I want my love to be happy and healthy, so if that means eating more calories with him then I can do that. I will do that. </TEXT>

So far cutting back on the stack hasn't made a huge impact and I'm hoping it stays that way. </TEXT>

I just realized I haven't binged in 17 days. I had chocolate for lunch today because I wanted it, and didn't feel the need to binge eat it. Only negative is I slept like shit last night so I'm going to try and cut back to stacking twice a day and taking it a little earlier. Hopefully my sleep quality will go back up and my appetite won't come back with too much a vengeance. </TEXT>
