	<TEXT> I do not doubt it could be able highlight something in a proper manner like blacklight; maybe greelight has some real life properties that could helps to have a better understanding of it.

And it is probably something on the ground, I think ([after watching this video](https://youtu.be/RafVwtMzjRc?t=2m15s)); also, it is probably not a peyote hunter item, for instance, because there are some underwater ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm going to search for some pictures of specific locations from old gen and see if I can tweak mine to match...

That would be a hard task I would indicate ealier, but it may be very difficult to achieve; some graphics changes are only effective after a restart, if I am not wrong.

 Do we really think anything is easier with increased graphical clarity? I mean, the secret exists on old gen, so could it possibly be easier to figure out with lower gfx settings? I mean, clues should not disappear just because you lowered an option below max.

The impression I have is that the higher settings might put more useless things on the landscape, making it harder to see what is substantial; at the same time, they could use higher graphics to insert detailed clues.

 Then again, the burger sign... Might be a red herring then?

It is the first thing I thought because I always watched people speculating about it and I have never been able to see it inside my own game; anyway, I understand anyone who sees it have one more thing to consider or even to waste time; the weirder thing about it is that my graphic is pretty much medium-like, not the worst and not the best, and I see it all blurred already.

To play the game with minimum settings must be a quite stoic approach.

There is a video in which a [Youtuber/hunter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXzqg_ahPgFCU0JFGnsiqA) plays with [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZr3Hb4SvGQ); also, he also noticed that a [chromed truck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbKoSmstLHM) could see different reflections because it uses lower standards while mirroring the in-game world, I am not sure if you are aware about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is hard to point a place, but, for instance, the way we tend to deal with this [terrain](http://i.imgur.com/A7NrBcQ.jpg) with a car while we runaway in the game is pretty much what I did; I diverted from the road climbing diagonally the mound and it has a sort of plain continuous top in which we are able to drive fast and practically steady.

Anyway, it was not a little mound like this one and it is off-off-road just like when we divert from the road and try to force a way till we find [alternative "roads"](http://i.imgur.com/DFn7qYa.jpg), that can be very irregular, but long/continous, while trying to be out of the radar.

I feel like I was with Trevor as in the beginning each character seems to be driven to certain areas and types of scenarios/grounds and this kind of gameplay was what I used to do while controlling him; also, I was probably forcing the wheel left, driving east to west-northwest while I was running as I remember.

If it is not an [excalibur-like sword](https://austinnewberry.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/excalibur_by_epar3d-d4zf7eq.jpg) itself, it is a sort of [isolated cross](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gta-myths/images/3/35/Graveonthemountain.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140509000827) as it has this kind of shape, and it is placed on a [dirty ground](http://media.gta-series.com/images/gta-5/collectibles/spaceship-parts/spaceship-part-31-grand-senora-desert.jpg) not green nor brown when you are there and there is no rock nor anything calling our attention bellow or around it and it looks dead and not interactive.

I guess, the map view is not exactly a good way to search for it as the terrain color and the mound paths may not indicate the real color of the ground and the tracks we find when we are really there, but I have just tried to point [regions](http://i.imgur.com/1tBePno.jpg) I feel I was although it could be anywhere else; I think it is not around common hunting areas, I mean, places where there are features about which we tend to have doubts related to by speceulating on the game most common topics like altruism/epsilonism, UFOs, Mt. Chiliad, you know: I say so because I have never returned there and spotted it again after starting to hunt and to discuss theories around here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is really weird, but I am sure there is a sword in the middle of the map, just like an excalibur, however, nothing like this crazy theory above.

When I was in the middle of a runaway I eventually climbed up some mounds, like we traditionally do while running from cops.

I was viewing my vehicle from above by controlling the camera and suddenly I noticed a sword and even changed the camera just to be sure and there was it.

By the time, I was more curious about the map, the gameplay and interesting details than about the hunt as I was not even aware about the mural and its implications.

It looked like just another detail, an allusion to excalibur itself, but not an interactive feature.

When I started to hunt from this subreddit, I left it aside as it seemed too common by the time and started to hunt like anybody else, based on theories and discussing the game.

After more than an year, I remembered that and noticed nobody knows about it here and when I search about it on Google the referred crazy theory always pop up and even katana mods are placed as results turning impossible to target the sword there is in the game.

Strangely enough, I have never been able to find it again; I remember well it is placed on the plain top of a mound on a dirty (yellow/oragne/brown) terrain.

I guess it is in the central part of the map, between the Cassidy Creek/Alamo Sea and the north of the new house of Franklin, but, really, it may be anywhere as I had a poor notion of the map by the time I stumbled on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you mean there is no follow-up in this thread, it is because it is based on the transcriptions of news reports produced by the local mainstream media, not actually an investigation.

Now, about the media itself, I guess they lost the interest as the case has been revealed and there is no substantial novelty around anymore.

Anyway, there is always a new report on websites like [G1](http://g1.globo.com/busca/?q=bruno+borges), I only do not transcribe them because it is easy for non-Portuguese speakers to translate them at the same time they are quite repetitive unlike the video reports that contextualized the case and showed a lot of things in details and even interviewed his family and friends. </TEXT>
