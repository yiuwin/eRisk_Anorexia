	<TEXT> People are expected to turn on their turn signal, look to their whole side, and in their mirrors before switching. This reduces the chance of accident greatly. However, I have almost been involved in a merging accident when the other party only looked behind and just proceeded to only use a turn signal as an indication. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to want to be a rapper since junior high, I've written hundreds of pages of raps and rhymes that are actually decent  these notebooks even had album schemes and song ideas  but it didn't reflect my childhood or personality. I had a loving family, went to private school, was in a city with a very low crime rate. I knew if I tried pursuing it people would make fun of me, so I just produce music and make beats for now, I still hope one day I could feel confident rapping what I wrote 5-10 years ago. </TEXT>
