	<TEXT> I honestly do not understand. In a previous update we are told:

"The Investigation team sought details of this process from the Company and assured the family that it would not be possible for a body to pass through the waste processing steps undiscovered  this has not been verified by the family, yet. However, it is understood that part of the assumption here is based on the fact that much of the waste is immediately incinerated at 1100c (to burn rubbish, but not metals), however once it exits the furnace it is checked manually  human bones would pass through this process relatively intact (needs to be over 1600c) and so should have been spotted if this had happened  but assumes someone was checking."

So how can they go from being that adamant to this new information?? Why did the phone ping at Barton Mills, which is miles apart from Milton?

Another thought that is going through my head is, did the person in dark clothing seen coming out of the horseshoe 4 minutes after Corrie went in ever get identified? What if they find a body in the landfill and it turns out not to be his?

So many questions, but hoping his family get some answers very soon.

	<TEXT> Only a bin lorry, which picked up bins in the loading bay half an hour after he was seen there. It has been forensically searched and dismissed. There was also a car that drove up a one way street the wrong way around the same time, but this has not been released to the public. All the vehicles in the area have been identified and searched, but not dismissed as far as I am aware.

There's an awful lot being kept back from us by authorities though. Up until last week, the CCTV of that area had only been reviewed from 3:34am - 8am, ridiculous! What if he had been sleeping there and had got up and left at 8:30am or something, vital clues could have been missed through lack of resources!

	<TEXT> I also found the change of story regarding the picture message sent to a friend was a bit odd. On an interview I watched, his brother said he was on the phone to him chatting that day, "he could't be happier". So odd. I live in Bury St Edmunds and think about this case ALL of the time. I hope some light is shed on the situation soon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's been missing from my hometown for over 10 weeks now, it is so upsetting. He was last seen on CCTV entering a loading bay. He was not been seen on any other CCTV since, this was the last sighting of him. There are absolutely no leads what so ever and I feel at a loss of what I can do to help, other than getting his name and face out there. #FindCorrie 3 </TEXT>
