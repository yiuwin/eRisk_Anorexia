	<TEXT> I discovered Reddit from a Rage Comic from Tumblr Five Years ago.

I joined instantly and been here ever since. Well not only limited to /r/Philippines but also different subreddits as well. 

Also, /r/Philippines was less than 70 people around that time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if this is considered because I did not ask for this.

I got an SUV as a Graduation gift eight to nine years ago from my parents. Fast forward today, the SUV that I got is now being used by my sister and her own family because I kept on complaining about how much the car consumes gas. It was replaced by a sedan that is very gas efficient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Final Fantasy IX is my most favorite Final Fantasy since I was in 6th grade. I'm now a working young adult in my late 20s and it's still my favorite. I love seeing people react to FFIX after finishing it. It gives me good vibes knowing that other people enjoyed the game I love.

Well, FFXV is for me is good. People have different opinions for it and I think that is normal. I also played FFXIII just get ready to have fun with the story. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my Friend's house he calls it his Hylian Crib.

[The facade of his Hylian Crib.](http://i.imgur.com/Drv9TWA.jpg)

[This is the main door entrance of his house.](http://i.imgur.com/PJkXp9s.jpg)

[His living room is the typical ordinary living room so I did not took a picture of it but when you go to the second floor of his house, he has a small bar that still in the process of getting more booze.](http://i.imgur.com/MldYSLf.jpg)

[Another view of his small bar.](http://i.imgur.com/fExY6PL.jpg)

[This one is on the third floor. The door to the left is his balcony but there is something behind that bookcase...](http://i.imgur.com/ZSSW6Nr.jpg)

[AHA! I wonder what's inside.](http://i.imgur.com/t7MeGpX.jpg)

[It's his gaming room!](http://i.imgur.com/5xTmyh6.jpg)

[Another view of his gaming room. He doesn't have Switch yet and he is still saving up money for it too. So he is currently playing FFXV here on his PS4 Pro on a 4k TV.](http://i.imgur.com/DgwA7c7.jpg)

[Panoramic view of his balcony.](http://i.imgur.com/DlXfU0n.jpg)

[Hope you enjoyed a small tour of his house!](http://i.imgur.com/WttgGKO.jpg)

EDIT: For some context. We're from the Philippines. A Switch costs here in an estimate of $350 to $450. He also help his parents in financial stuff. His house was fully built early to mid 2016 so he still in the process of paying some more bills too. That's why he is still saving up for a Switch. He is the patient type so he is still waiting for the right time to buy a Switch here in our country. </TEXT>

Come to think of it. Yeah, it is plastic. They should have somehow made it Gorilla Glass or something.

I'll still buy it though. You're right about its flaws but it won't stop me to save up and purchase it. I still have my n3DS XL and use it whenever I'm in a bank with a long queue line or waiting for someone. </TEXT>

Sami   KO are always together even before their NXT days. I think WWE is saving up a feud for the both of them.

I'm also looking forward for The Revival but Dash Wilder got injured. :(

Ruru was very underutilized in RAW. I hope him and Lana are better in SDL. Asuka vs Nia happened in NXT. Nia lost and up until now, Asuka is still undefeated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> JR is back in WWE but only for special occasions like Undertaker vs Roman Reigns from the recent Wrestlemania 33.

The new set of commentators are getting good. Raw and Smackdown Live are now separated again. 

Raw has Micheal Cole, Corey Graves and Booker T (Substituting for David Otunga) while Smackdown Live has Tom Phillips, JBL and Byron Saxton.

If you want to watch it keep an open mind and give the new wrestlers a chance. Without a doubt that the Attitude Era was the best and irreplaceable but give the new generation a chance. I start watching WWE since 1998 then stopped watching last 2007. I got back watching again when I heard the 2016 draft so it got interesting for me again. Also check out /r/SquaredCircle too. </TEXT>

Though easy-saver has 5php service charge per-transaction. Also all their ATM cards are Debit/EPS (Electronic Payment System) ready.

Metrobank has a maintaining balance of 2k and also their cards are Debit ready too.

	<TEXT> Fellow car owners of /r/Philippines, I have a question and seeking advice. 

I use a 2012 Honda City and for bi-yearly change oil/maintenance I always go to straight to a Honda dealer. It does hurt my wallet a lot but at the back of my mind, I have less worries. My dad suggested that I should try other Casa like Bridgestone Service Center, Value Plus or Rapide since my car is around 5 years old and out of warranty. 

My question, is it a good idea that I should change to a different service center? </TEXT>

I'm still waiting for a possible price drop but if you really want a much lower price for a Switch (and if you have relatives or friends who will go there) it's on Japan, Hong Kong and (maybe?) Singapore is the best place to buy.

For anything else, you can ask more questions in /r/NintendoPH </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the matches last night on RAW some how makes sense for mostly send-offs.

Nia vs Charlotte match was a send-off for Charlotte,

The 4-man tag team was a send-off for the Shining Stars (should have been Gallows and Anderson for The Club to form hence a stable which WWE lack nowadays),

Sami vs Miz was a send-off for Sami

Ambrose vs KO was a send-off for KO

EDIT: New Day vs The Revival was a send-off for New Day(?) Damn, I love the rivalry of New Day vs The Revival.

EDIT 2: Jinder vs Finn was a send-off for Jinder </TEXT>

Not unless if Brock moves to SDL with the WWE Universal Champion. Imagine the Universal Champion changing its color from red to blue if ever it ever happens. </TEXT>

Add to that, saving up money for Nintendo Switch too!

	<TEXT> Hearing that there are some Switch that has hardware issues from their first batch release makes me realize that it is better to buy late. It reminds me when PS4 Pro also had hardware issues on their first batch release.

Still saving money for it though. Hows your gaming life been when you had Switch? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Add to that, Reddit isn't that user friendly for first time users who hasn't heard and visited this site. And again, they don't know how Downvoting works.

EDIT: Correct me if I'm wrong and I forgot to add. Reddit has a system to new users that gives them a time limit before posting. Also, Downvotes and Upvotes also plays a role too. If a reddit account has negative karma points, it has a time limit before posting a new one again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, they did say that you can pay it in installment basis. Then again if your bank is BPI, there is credit to cash option that is payable depending on your preference but the max is 24 months. Im tempted but I rather save money for this rather than using my credit card.  </TEXT>
