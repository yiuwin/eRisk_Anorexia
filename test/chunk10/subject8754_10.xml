	<TEXT> I've been riding public transportation for almost 3 years now. At first it was out of necessity but now it's by choice. Luckily I had a job opportunity that only takes me 50 min to get to work by bus. I save on gas,insurance and car note. It cost me $24 to get to work for the whole month. I also give a co-worker $25 to bring me home after. The only reason I don't ride with him to work is because he likes to get there right on time and I like to be early. The only set backs are some of the drivers. The other morning my connecting bus was 11 min late but she still got off the bus so she could talk on the phone for another 6-7 min. Things like that really get to me early in the morning because most of us on the bus that early are just trying to get to work. I see it as them being inconsiderate. There are other downfalls to public transportation but like the saying goes "you get what you pay for." </TEXT>
