	<TEXT> I honestly don't know how to explain it better but I'll try.. Computer, seemingly, randomly reboots if I manually shut the screens off using the power buttons. But if I  leave the screens on (the screens still never sleep as my settings do not permit it), my computer does not reboot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well on my 19th (legal drinking age in my province), my mom and her gf took me out for drinks. Which was pretty cool as my mom has been a bartender most her life and got me to have a bunch of different shots. 
I also may not be too normal, as I am a momma's boy and don't have or care for having a lot of friends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My first and only credit card I got from the bank I go through (RBC here in Canada). It was just a simple credit card that gives me points back on every purchase, which is what I recommend. I have really good credit while having the credit card and they would just offer me increases on my credit card. (Started at $2000, currently at $14500.) The only thing I would think to worry about is making sure it is paid off before the interest takes effect (I believe it's usually a 21 day grace period to pay it off before you have to pay interest on what you owe). 
As for customer service, I have never had any issues with my card where I have needed customer service so I don't have any complaints there.

Even with your edits, I would look at the credit cards that the bank you go through offers. I definitely recommend just getting one that gives you points back. Unless you travel a lot and can get a travel points card. Although, someone may know more as I've never had a credit card from any other company. I just find it very convent to be able to pay it just from online banking, which my bank has an app for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had one quite frequently when I was younger, haven't had it in about 10 years though. It was always about the apocalypse and I was the last person alive. Usually woke up pretty soon after it so I don't remember many details. Besides everything was burning and red and black. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have double and triple checked my power settings on my pc and as far as I can tell, it shouldn't be doing this.

My pc is in my room and I have 2 screens, when I go to bed I shut off both screens. Every time I wake up and go on my pc, I have to log back in and every program I had open is closed. 

Although, I have used my pc before going to work, and left my screens on and when I come home from work it is just as it was. I am not bad with computers and usually know what to do or where to look when I have issues. But I have not been able to solve this one at all. 

Any help is appreciated! </TEXT>
