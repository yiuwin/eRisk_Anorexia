	<TEXT> I'll post some fun stuff from my "seen" collection (I use to take notes on each of my museum visits and make sure to collect decent-quality scans of those picks  typically about 2 to 10) over the next days. This is from one of the leading East German painters, the late Werner Tbke.

Historical context: Dr. Schulze is a (fictitious) Nazi jurist, an allegory of the continuity in personnel from the Nazi time into the West German Federal Republic (the East had some of those cases, but significantly fewer, and used the Western examples for propaganda). The best-known such ex-Nazi officials were Hans Globke, in fact a jurist, who was the second-most influential West German statesman after chancellor Adenauer in the 1950s and who in 1935 had drafted the most prominent commentary to the Nuremberg laws; and Theodor Oberlnder, minister for refugees and expulsed people and formerly probably engaged in the massacres of Lww, amongst other murderous activities. </TEXT>
