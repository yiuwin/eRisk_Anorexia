	<TEXT> Be nice to everyone until they give you a reason not to be.

I'm a doll to everyone,but if you're a bitch to me,or treat me badly,the niceness or my part STOPS immediately.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did respond to the other poster,I was in no means trying to be dishonest.

The circumstances were less than flattering,and I was kinda trying to save face. Neither guy I am sleeping with is my boyfriend,I'm not exclusive with anyone.

I have fat days like everyone else,and the day that I posted that previous question,I was feeling really badly about myself. But I'm like a lot of women,constantly trying to improve my self esteem and self image. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't lied about anything.

That isn't the same guy. I'm not super proud of the fact that I'm sleeping with multiple people at the same time,and it wasn't relevant to this story,but now that you browsed my past posts,I have to explain myself. I'm a whore obviously,but I'm not a liar.

Yeah. I'm fucking skinny,but I'm working on loving my body. EVERYONE struggles with their body image. I'm not going to lie,that was a bad day when I posted that question. I felt gross,and I needed to vent. Are you telling me that you never have days where you feel unattractive? Really?

I wasn't dishonest about anything,there were certain details of this story that weren't relevant,like the fact that I'm sleeping with multiple people,but now that you felt like being fucking Sherlock Holmes of Reddit,I had to explain myself. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alrighty,I'm currently in a bit of a disagreement with my man friend. 

I'm very comfortable with my body,I work hard to be small,toned and petite,and I honestly just love being naked. It's not for sexual purposes,I HATE pants,I love being comfortable,and I'm not shy. 

This past week I was studying with a guy friend,who I have ZERO attraction to. We wanted to take a break,so we planned on running over to the gym and getting a workout in. I didn't feel like walking down two flights of stairs to use a female bathroom to change into my gym clothes,so I just stripped down and changed in the guys' dorm room. I didn't think twice about it,and I honestly wasn't trying to be slutty or anything like that. We worked out,got back to studying and didn't think twice about it.

My studying partner is friends with my man friend,and mentioned to him that I was attractive and had a nice body. He mentioned that I changed in front of him,and my man friend was PISSED. He's pissed at me,I'm in trouble,and I'm trying to figure out it i'm wrong. 

So are you comfortable being naked in front of others??   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do the phone survey.

If you have her name,during the survey,there will be a specific time where you can speak,and you can talk about your experience. I've worked in retail for a few years,and these surveys do actually make it back to the managers and higher ups. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a fellow Montanan,I agree.
Montanans are some of the nicest people you could ever meet,but they are not too friendly towards "outsiders" coming to live here.

But visiting is encouraged!:) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly,depending on how severe you are,some doctors won't take you on as a patient,as they may see you as a liability. In the past,I've been turned down by medical doctors and psychologists because of how low weight I was,and they didn't want to be held accountable if anything bad were to happen to me.

My medical doctor who did have experience with Anorexia almost acted as a therapist as well. Eating disorders are really complex and hard to understand,and until people have experience working with eating disordered patients,they often don't understand them at all. 

My dad is a clinical psychologist who has had anorexic patients in the past,and even he struggles to understand the disease. People just don't understand them. Anorexia isn't that well studied or that well understood,and people have a really hard time wrapping their heads around them.

Yes,definitely talk with your doctor. They may give referrals, and if they don't know somebody directly,they likely will ask around until they can get you an answer. A doctor with experience with EDs is VERY important. I once had a medical doctor who had zero understanding/experience with anorexia,and I remember how horrible the experience with him was,and how it likely made things worse.  </TEXT>
