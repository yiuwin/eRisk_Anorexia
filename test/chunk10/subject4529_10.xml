	<TEXT> Damn, that girl is beautiful. It has nice tune, kind of song that always comes around. I don't think about music styles and genres when I listen to music, and I listen A LOT. If I like it, i listen to it, no need for defining it by genre, most of what I listen does not have any specific genre actually. Well, gotta go, need to catch some sleep for tomorrow. Nice messaging with you through comments tho :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Twenty One Pilots are always good to listen, always enjoyable. Maybe you should try to listen some Tame Impala?
Edit: Also, [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpMfP6qUSBo) is quite catchy, just found out about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I can understand how you felt, although I'm not in that same position as you were. I get really anxious and overwhelmed in certain moments, I feel really dull and alienated. I thought of going to psychiatrist, but I think I just need someone who can listen all what i have to throw out of myself. Thanks for sharing your experience! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do not do that! I mean, don't think like that, it will make things worse! I know you wanna see her because you love her, but if you really love her you should try to understand her. Try reading people anxiety experiences. Don't bother with asking her is she okay, don't try directly to cheer her up by saying "Cheer up!", or "Snap out of it" because it won't happen, not in that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How old are you? I'm really upset at some moments because i think I occasionally have anxiety symptoms and I don't think that i felt them before. I read somewhere that these kind of "illness" appears in early twenties (I'm turning 20). I just wanna know do you remember how it all began (anxiety). </TEXT>
