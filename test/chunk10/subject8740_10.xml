	<TEXT> Right now I'm in eating disorder treatment 10 hours a day, 7 days a week living halfway across the country from my family and I'm feeling super bummed today.

My roommates are great but they don't know about what is going on so I still feel super lonely and discouraged because despite 10 days in the hospital and 2 weeks of PHP I'm still not medically cleared to walk around Target despite working my ass off in treatment. 

My mom has been a mess ever since I was in the hospital (she told me that she starts to panic whenever I don't answer a text because she can't help but think I could be dead) and while I am open with her I don't want her to feel like she has to fly out here or make her feel guilty that she can't be here. 

My body image is terrible and I feel physically awful and overly full and I have so many emotions going on I just need to vent to someone who isn't another therapist or patient for a hot minute because no matter how many times they tell me I still can't believe that I am underweight (though I have stopped denying that I'm not in the best place medically).

I don't know what I need, I just needed to get that out and let myself be a mess because I am not even 20 years old and while I'm doing my best, I've had this disorder for close to half of my life and been through treatment enough times to know what to expect but now I'm just sad, overwhelmed and lonely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually feeling motivated to push myself and recover from my eating disorder! 

I posted here a few weeks ago when I was first hospitalized and figured I'd update; I spent 10 days in the pediatric hospital getting medically stabilized (which is boring as fuck when you are almost 20) and got discharged just in time to take my finals and finish my sophomore year of college. Now I am in a 10 hour a day, 7 day a week PHP program and while I didn't want to do it initially I am starting to see how much I needed this help and accept that I am where I need to be right now. 

I am experiencing a lot of body image distress because despite the 11 prescription medications I am currently taking I have trouble accepting that I am actually 'sick' and truly believe that I look fine and my weight isn't a problem (but I the way I got to this weight is) but I am showing up to program every day and have made it through the last 2 days without refusing and meals, snacks, supplements (both prescribed and ones given if a meal isn't finished.) 

I feel gross and fluffy as I am on a "zero movement plan" (today I was told that walking around Target is considered 'exercise') and my meal plan feels insane (I can post it if you want) but I am doing this and even if I don't want this for myself it breaks my heart to know how much anxiety I have been causing my parents.

Don't do it homie. I'm only a little older than you but I can promise that no good will come of restricting and getting to a low weight; best case you come to your senses and spend a few weeks being miserable for no good reason, worst case you're stuck with an eating disorder, and these things fucking suck.

	<TEXT> Have you ever heard of Familial Hypercholesterolemia? I did a project on it for a genetics course and it is a relatively common genetic disorder (estimated incidence of heterozygous form is 1/250 people worldwide) that is rarely diagnosed because high cholesterol is so common treatable that a lot of doctors might not feel the need to look for the etiology if a patient is asymptomatic (when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras!)  

People with this condition inherited faulty genes from one or both parents (it is a dominant disorder, but if you are homozygous, which is rare its usually pretty severe) and their livers suck at metabolizing and getting rid of cholesterol. This leads to excessively high HDL cholesterol and increases the risk of premature cardiovascular disease. 

I am NOT trying to diagnose you or anything, this just came to mind when I read that you are a young, healthy weight individual with a family hx of super early onset cardiovascular disease who has elevated cholesterol.

	<TEXT> It was ok. 

I was in the hospital for 10 days being treated for medical complications of my eating disorder and refeeding syndrome and I got discharged Friday evening and while I was glad to be out (being an adult in a pediatric hospital is super boring) returning to the real world was a bit overwhelming, and going about my usual business is exhausting after 6 days of complete bed rest and 4 days of bed rest plus 2 short slow walks around the hospital. 

Also, finals start today so I spend a lot of time trying to study because I never feel prepared. 

I want to stay out of the hospital but eating the amount I am supposed to is so hard and time consuming, and I'm so petrified of gaining weight in any form that the idea of gaining fat that I really don't think I need is making it super challenging.

For me, high school served its purpose; I grew a lot as a person, developed social skills, had my first boyfriend, got a handle on my mental health issues and learned how to translate being smart and curious into being a good student. 

I really don't talk to anyone that I was friends with in high school (besides my ex boyfriend who is still one of my closest friends) and I'm totally cool with that. I wasn't bullied and I was friendly with plenty of people but I didn't have close friends who I really feel the need to keep up with. The people that I hung out in high school are great and I'm sure we would have fun if we ended up running into each other somewhere but ultimately most of us didn't have a ton in common besides being nice, in AP classes and legally obligated to be in the same building together 5 days a week.  </TEXT>

I get that pets can get a bit chunky as they get older but it breaks my heart to see obese dogs waddling around because a.) it is hard on their little joints and b.) being super overweight and having crappy joints prevents them from doing the things that make them the happiest (running around, sniffing, exploring).

When you have a pet, it is your job to take care of it and overfeeding it and not providing it with enough exercise just isn't fair to the animal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree that adopting is great, heck I worked at an animal rescue all through high school but I can also see why some people choose not to go that route and have no problem with people getting dogs from a responsible breeders who produce healthy dogs and carefully screen their clients. 

For someone who has never had a dog before it can be great to get one from someone who knows a lot about the breed and can provide follow up, plus, you will already have some idea what you are getting yourself into when it comes to size, shedding, activity needs and demeanor (obviously, each individual dog has its own quirks but breeds are known for different personality traits). 

Getting dogs from a pet store or puppy mill is shitty and I am not down with that but I am not willing to judge people who want to get breeder dogs because adopting might not be for everyone every time.  </TEXT>

THIS IS SELF CARE AND IT SUCKS! Hopefully I'll be off complete bed rest tomorrow but today is just me in my bed with the foam egg crate pad to protect my boney body (I don't know why I have it but I'm not complaining), 3 meals, 3 snacks and heart monitors that WILL NOT STOP BEEPING. </TEXT>

I also know a fair number of people who were expected to contribute to their car in some way whether they bought it themselves or had to pay the parents a certain amount, or their parents got them a car but they were on the hook for paying to maintain it to and maybe some of their insurance. 

I also know people who inherited cars from a grandparent/older relative who passed away/stopped driving. 

Used cars aren't too expensive if you know where to look and are patient (my dad gets all of our cars used; he is into BMWs and since they depreciate fast he got his last car for cheap from a guy who just always had to have the newest one). Oddly, it can be harder to find a decent used Honda or Subaru because people hold onto them forever.  </TEXT>

Freshman year in our "Success in College and Nursing" class (basic freshman class in every major) we had a whole unit on weight control and had an assignment where we had to use MFP for a week and reflect on on our own choices and how it could be helpful to patients. 

We also have to take a pretty hardcore nutrition course taught by a shitlord PhD who specializes in obesity research.  </TEXT>

I have an eating disorder and I'm not doing too well right now (restricting and purging a ton) but my bloodwork is pretty much normal because human bodies are really good at maintaining homeostasis. When labs come back abnormal that isn't the first sign that you have a problem, it is a sign that your body can no longer compensate for the damage done by your disease process/shitty life choices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eating disorder: In a lot of ways I think it can be compared to drug addiction or OCD; when I am in a bad place my behaviors feel like the only way to get relief from my anxiety and as weird as it sounds, purging or restricting does make me feel better. It isn't that I want to do these things I'm just scared of what will happen if I don't which is how I felt about other compulsive behaviors (hand washing) that I engaged in when I was a kid. Intellectually, I completely understand why what I am doing is unhealthy (I'm a nursing major for goodness sake) but the idea of changing my behavior is so overwhelming it seems impossible and at some level, I really don't want to change because recovery is just a different kind of hard and uncomfortable. Despite what my doctor and blood tests say; I can't accept that my weight is not healthy which runs so contrary to my frustration with people who deny science and ignore experts because "they know better". 

I'm petrified of gaining weight and I still refuse to believe that I need to and once I enter the cycle of restricting it the number of calories that I consider "too much" gets smaller and smaller.  </TEXT>

Most of the girls care was still covered by their Canadian healthcare and they were approved for 90 days of coverage with possible extensions when they came up for review where most Americans were fighting with their insurance multiple times a week to get another few days covered.  </TEXT>
