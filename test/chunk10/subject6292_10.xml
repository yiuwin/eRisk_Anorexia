	<TEXT> When I saw hat man the first time I was terrified. I woke up unable to move and was sure I was drugged or something. That's when I looked to my right (eyes only as I couldn't move) and saw him in the doorway. I had recently been doing a lot of research on government conspiracies, but had never heard of hat man and hadn't looked into aliens or men in black.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They look the same, so I'm curious what you all think of this theory? I've personally had two experiences with Hat Man during sleep paralysis. I've had no known encounters with Men in Black. Both are fascinating topics to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oops I didn't reply to you directly
I wanted to add, I see a strange zig zagging light most nights at different times, it is the same colors and doesn't follow the trajectory a plane would, also when planes pass overhead at seemingly the same distance above I can clearly hear them, but this odd strobe like zig zag lights make no sound whatsoever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have watched them nightly, I've tried with my phone and it doesn't pick up, tonight I went out with my dslr and zoom lens, but my tripod is broken and I was unable to get video- honestly never tried taking video on my camera before, just pictures, so I'll have to figure that out if I want a chance of recording them.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lights in my sky multiplying </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Two weeks ago I noticed a strange light while looking out my bedroom window. This light was above a cluster of trees, up and to the left when looking out. I noticed it immediately because it was much brighter than the stars and was pulsing between a few different colors- red/orange, blue/some cool color, and white. After watching it seemed to move straight up and down. I went to bed wondering what it could be but not dwelling too much. 
The next clear night I looked out again to see if it was there and it was in a similar place but not exactly where it had been. I watched it and over the course of an hour it moved out of sight, just slight movements here and there and eventually it was gone out of my view (but may have still been above my house). That's the night I also noticed another- same characteristics but totally different location, this one was straight out front, and seemed a little farther away. I could see them both at the same time so I know it wasn't the same light source.

I've been watching them nightly for days and it seems like they almost double every night or so! Small ones, not as bright, larger ones (all about the size of stars but colorful and pulsing with light). I've googled and these seem fairly common to see although no one has an explanation. I'm assuming they are UFOs and would love to know if anyone else has seen them- perhaps with a telescope? Or if anyone had more information? Thanks! </TEXT>
