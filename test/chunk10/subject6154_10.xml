The usage of that song, as you describe it, would NOT qualify for fair use. Unless you're doing reviews/news-reporting, it's best to steer clear of all third-party material you don't own the rights / licence to.

Oh, that won't be a problem, haha. He comes through NY/NJ/PA like 5x on every tour. Usually/lately, him and the band have been touring every 3 years or so (depending on albums). You just missed the huge "The River"-box set tour, so it might be a while before the E Street Band does a big tour again. As for price? Expect to spend around $60 - 150.

BackStreets.com is an excellent source of news, and there's a few die hard Twitter accounts that update on all things The Boss (@Stan_Goldstein   @GreasyLake are both good).

	<TEXT> From the [eBay listing](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rare-Back-To-Future-3-Screen-Used-Movie-Prop-Baby-Crib-Michael-J-Fox-With-Coa-/371832701922), 

 *This is an original movie prop for back to future 3 . This was a gift from a prop master to a friend of mine a long time ago . This was used in a scene where they were in the west and there was a bag in a crib in a barn . It resembles the crib as well in previous movie where Marty travels to 1955 and meets his uncle In a crib. It comes with authenticity from the gallery for the estate the collection came from . Very nice original movie prop. I have many other movie prop screen used costume items . Please see my store .* 

Anyone know which scene / shot he's referring to? I just checked part III, and the crib William McFly is towards the beginning of the movie is a traditional wooden rocker, not a prison-like cage like this. No idea what "barn" he's referring to either. Doc's workshop? No cribs in there, either.

	<TEXT> Yes and yes. I wouldn't have suggested you negotiate otherwise. Just a simple, "Thank you for your interest. Would you be willing to pay $650?"

 The agreement was for a two year, exclusive arrangement, correct? $500 is fair, but never hurts to ask for more. Worst that happens is they say "no", and you just agree to the original price. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always wanted to edit this - but wanted to include some of the 1955 portions of Part II during their respective moments in part I (when Marty steps off the stage, and sees the sand bags on Biff's goons). I think it'd a very interesting way to experience the trilogy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, the viewer-comments are a very small portion of the show now, as I'm only including them for one-review per episode. 

I used to read them out-loud - but it was much easier from a production standpoint to add them in post. Plus, it gives me an opportunity to share a small section of the film's music. But yeh, it's a tricky balance. Appreciate the feedback :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeh, it's a catch-22 I've struggled with. Watch my new "Anaconda" reviews from the other night, and leave a comment and let me know if you think it's improved any. I recently got a teleprompter, and within the last year, have been trying to phase in more conversational-words into my reviews so they don't seem as "prepared". 

But that's the only one I do that is actually scripted - my other 15+ shows are all improvised :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have! It sounds like you're already familiar with my newest project, "Tech Check" - but response to that was really positive, so I'm looking forward to producing more of those. I've never quite had the cult-of-personality for straight-entertainment, but informational/educational programming about technology or movie analysis seems to be a better fit. Just gotta build (another) audience for it. 

As for FilmRiot, I have to admit I'm not familiar with their channel - but I love "Every Frame A Painting" - Tony's insight makes me look like a high school drop out, and not someone with a media-degree and a decade of film-reviewing experience! I hope to try my first long-form, more analytical reviews later this year in a sub-series about "film theory", and shit like that. Some might just be goofy (like how "Face/Off" is the most insane movie ever made) - whereas others might be a serious look at how 9/11 killed the rom-com. 

Again, no idea if there's an audience for that - but I'm fascinated and motivated to try, so I think I will. In the meantime, keep an eye out for an awesome new super-cut I'll be releasing this week or the next! (Also, I still do those live-editing videos every few months, search YouTube for "Jon Edits").  </TEXT>

2) I Reddit a lot. Guessing I'd be mentioned in a thread about old YouTubers is a pretty safe bet.

3) Fans/friends often @reply me directly to notify me. (Happened 3x for this thread)

4) Viewership sees a small bump, not too hard to trace back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Precisely. My "Roller Coaster Commotion" show always did very well (critically, views, revenue) - But actually filming a new season requires flying two or more people across the country, renting hotel rooms, and paying for safety insurance so theme parks will allow us to film. Sure, the show should eventually make back that $3,000+ budget, but it'd take years, and not even a guarantee than.

Thanks to you as well. Have a lovely weekend. </TEXT>
