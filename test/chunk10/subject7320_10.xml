	<TEXT> There's been a weird amount of posts reaching the front page about this show.  And don't get me wrong it's not the greatest thing ever, but it's fine and it's important to have programming like this.  The post I see knocking the show are because they personally feel attacked.  Guess what!?  your fad diet is bullshit you fucking moron.  Honestly we should be encouraging this kind of program because we have nothing but a shovel of bullshit being forced down our throats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before my wife and I moved were in between two houses where we constantly had interactions like this and probably a lot worse as there were regular threats of violence.  If I had a to try to explain it's probably  combination of being trashy and being brought up to believe they are trashy and then having that reinforced by outside influence.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rittenhouse hands down for the manhattans.  I used Bulleit for a long time and when I tried Rittenhouse, the difference was huge.  You can drink bulleit neat if you like, there's nothing too jarring about it and it is quite pleasant after 2 sips.  Rittenhouse, though, no.  Unless you like a kick in the teeth.  More important than the whiskey is the vermouth for manhattans.  You'll want to splurge a little bit on the vermouth especially your dry vermouth if you use it in your manhattan.  You should also be using luxardo cherries and not regular candied cherries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The daily show almost always uses actors and heavy editing.  They have never tried to hide this but they haven't gone out of their way to show this.  People have mentioned the irony of getting smug self satisfaction from watching people they think are idiots while it's them who are in fact the idiots.  I'm not saying these people don't exist, but I would take this time for some self reflection of whether or not you are any better than these "gullible uninformed people" </TEXT>

I look at the comments in these types of subs and it's always people getting triggered about people getting triggered.  And there is usually more to story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously.  Why not just do an alternate reality where Trump is just the best fucking President we ever had.  And just have him constantly first-person narrating why he is/isn't doing something and why it is phenomenal/disastrous.  Like keep his same demeanor but have him go " Of course I'm not going to do a half assed muslim ban that accomplishes nothing and only incites our enemies"  And then hire on a couple political scientists to help with what he would do to make a utilitarian decision.  And make it aware of itself but not so wink wink nudge nudge (sorry I don't know literary lingo).  And even end it with it being a happy ending and just let it sit like that.  Just one giant juxtaposition without having the rug pulled out at the end.

edit: typos and such </TEXT>

I've been doing story mode for all to get ES (storymode boxes drop eternity splinters) for more random hero tokens, only one dupe out of 6.

	<TEXT>   The U.S. Libertarian Party political platform (2012) states: "Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good-faith views on all sides, we believe that government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration."

You either provide funding or you don't.  You can't have a dogmatic stance of "no government interference"  One way or another your will have the big bad boogeyman government making it their business.  Also libertarians, in general, are pretty split on abortion.  The party has only existed since the 70s has had little to no influence except to get "big government" off the case of innocent billionaires trying to dump chicken shit wherever they please.  So it's difficult to say how much of their platform actually aligns with the views of would be voters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, polar was a bit of hyperbole.  I'm not going to argue on the two parties in relation the two major parties.  To generalize them both, however, you could say that libertarians (depends who you ask because most libertarians don't seem to understand where their party aligns)seek to reduce government where possible and the green party seek to strengthen it.  Now this is not a completely true statement, but it is true enough to make the point the ventura doesn't know what the fuck he is talking about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why do you trump up your service whenever given the opportunity?  On your wikipedia page you have your rank listed as  Special Warfare Operator 3rd Class.  You were the lowest petty officer rank and this NOT a common practice to list your job as your rank unless there is shorthand where you are stationed.  Your career can summed up by your two ribbons that only prove that you graduated boot camp during war time.  It's not a big deal that you didn't have some glamorous career.  For example, I was in the Marine Corps 10 years, where I was primarily a laser technician and I did a stint as an embassy guard.  Now I could easily make that sound way fancier than it is, but I don't.  Now I don't know you, but I've known many like you and they are all shitbags.  Prone to constantly lieing and bragging to cover up insecurities.  That is your life, and when someone calls you out on it you lash out of with roid driven angst.

I really wish the media and politics wasn't polluted with people like you that can't simply go fade into the background, but instead have to constantly insert yourself in the limelight to get one more fix of validation.

It could be argued that people like you are the reason the Stolen Valor act exists and if there any justice, you would be charged with it. </TEXT>

A coupe things to consider:  it is possible that a lot of his work was stolen and then he used his powerful religious position to stamp out their existence in history,  he was by most accounts he was crazy af,  and it was also possible he was using his late in life position to disprove a lot of things about religion.

Whatever the case is, when it comes to Newton all we have is an extremely sanitized version of the events.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What about politics did you study.  Surely someone with a background in engineering can appreciate how broad of a topic that is.  That's like saying you studied science or math.  You might even start by saying what type of engineer you are.  You aren't old enough for the generic "engineer" so I'm assuming you had a discipline.  

You have to understand that although we "younger folk" are insufferable and disrespectful, we can also smell a giant pile of bullshit from a mile away.  We didn't grow up in a time where you could make sweeping generalizations and everyone goes "hey that sounds like a swell idea".

For fucks sake, you are supposedly an engineer which would boast a fine attention to detail, so show some attention to detail in your approach.    </TEXT>

Also when things sound too good to be true it's because we've accepted some low ball offer and now we are trying to sell the idea to the public and to those who approve funding.  making it sound sexy exciting is a good indicator that project doesn't have a lot of meat on it's bones.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I genuinely want to know what it is like to be full of this much shit.  Is just the money?  It cannot just be the money, but nothing else explains it.  Do you get some sort of high by being a bullshit peddler?  Or is just that you have so much money and influence from the richer dicks you suck that you it puts you in this upper echelon where you can no longer understand what reality is anymore.

When you figure it out, bottle it and sell and I'm sure that will enable to you suck even richer dicks with even more influence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> from about 15 yards away that's still going to be accurate enough to drive the point home.  When I had to shoot them on the range, after about 70 slugs, I'd drop my stance just like that when the range coaches weren't looking.  My shoulder couldn't take it anymore.  Felt like a tiny ninja was iron fisting me in the same spot over and over again.

edit: This might also be because of the hair style.  Disclaimer: this might be racist, we'll need a ruling from the black delegation of reddit.  I feel like if she held it properly, a couple shots into it her hair would ignite.  That hair style is kept compacted with product, correct? I've seen a persons's face spark up because they had oil based resin from OC spray left on their skin, not sure how common that is (probably not very). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Majority of it stems from Tamara Keith.  NPR is still my go to and I think if you gave it a chance again you'd find there is still quality programming.  I only really watch NOVA and Frontline on PBS so I can't comment on their other programs.  I don't feel like these are the programs you are referring to because in my opinion they are pretty credible.

I just straight up don't like her, she makes me want to change my preset radio station.  Let me clarify that I support Clinton and will be voting for her.  But Tamara Keith has the subtlety of a four year old trying to hide that they, in fact, ate the entire bag of cookies while you weren't looking.

edit: just a quick after thought I had when I hit submit.  I just want the news.  It's why I listen to NPR.  I don't want someone telling me how I should I think about a news story. </TEXT>
