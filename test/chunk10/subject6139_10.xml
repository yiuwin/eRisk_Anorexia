I wasn't sure if I was happy with it yet 
I've tweaked it a billion times 
That was actually the only idea I had for the build before I started it so I kind of designed the house around the sloped roof, adding rooms as I went to balance the lines of the build.

	<TEXT> This isn't normally the type of beat that I'm into, but I like the groove of it. 
I think that the actual arrangement is pretty good but I think you could pick some better sounds. 
They just sound out of place with the one good high synth sound. 
I would say just play around with sounds and find some that fit together better  </TEXT>

That shit had me groovin 
If I was to say anything I would say it maybe needs some very faint strings or something way in the back to fill it out 
Also the high hat could use some eq'ing but that's just a nitpick 
Great job! Would love to hear someone busting out a smooth flow on this

I can see what you're saying, man. 
I guess I was trying to sound defeated or like I had given up, but I guess it doesn't come through. 
I'm gonna do a rerecord with some more emotion in it. 
Your track is fucking classic man. 
I love old school flows and I think you combined some new and old really, really well. 
I would say maybe turn your vocals up a bit but there isn't much wrong with it </TEXT>

Your voice is unreal! 
It's super unique and that's a huge plus for you, and your lyrical content was pretty gnarly! 
If I had anything to say it would be to find some variety in your delivery. Sometimes with a voice as deep as yours people can kind of get hypnotized by it
But that's a small nitpick man I'm definitely gonna give you a follow!

If I had anything to criticize it would be that the hi hat rolls are a tad too loud and I would let that lead melody take up more of the high end space 
Overall great beat!

	<TEXT> I've never really been a fan of the stuttery type of beats like this, but this one had some groove to it! 
Also I thought the chords you used were fantastic. 
I like the state of the track as is, but I feel like it would be pushed to the next level if it had something else with it. I'm not sure what exactly, but maybe a high lead synth or something else in a higher register to even it out. 
Great job though!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend got kicked out of his place about a month ago and he moved into my place without really asking me. I just happened to be at his house when he got kicked out. 
He quit his job the very next day and isn't trying to find a new one. 
I can barely afford to live by myself and my anxiety makes my life difficult enough without him being here.
I have been a wreck, as I am a creature of habit and rituals (OCD), and they have all been disturbed.
I need to tell him to leave but I can't muster up the courage to talk to him about it. 
I don't know what to do...

	<TEXT> If you are bored by the song you're playing, try figuring out places in the song that you would change or add on to 
Make the song your own and experiment with different versions of it 
Maybe get a keyboard and try some new sounds with the same old songs 
Or you could record the piano part and try to record additional partswith the keyboard  to fill the piece out.  
That's how my progression normally goes

I usually just do black and grey stuff so I've been getting into watercolor to work on my color theory 
I've worked out how to make most colors, but I could never get a nice, cool grey like that

	<TEXT> Hahaha you just proved me right. 
You keep denying that YOU are in control of your life. 
You will be unhappy and alone until the day you die, and it won't be anybody's fault but your own. 
I would tell you to kill yourself if you felt that strongly about this, but you'd probably say "even if I killed myself no one would care" or some other pathetic bullshit. So, all I will say is I hope you get out of the slump you're in. 
I hope you find someone who cares for you. 
I really hope you can find something in life to cling to, because it's not all about sex and girls.
Have a good life... if you ever need to talk or need a friend you can message me, and I'm serious about that.  </TEXT>
