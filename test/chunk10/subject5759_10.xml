Why would it do that when we've got the service provider requiring us to explicitly authenticate channels anyway?

     Broadcast::channel('global', function () {
            return ['name' = 'guest'];

So I tried to override the middleware in the service provider:

    Broadcast::routes( [ 'middleware' = null ] );

	<TEXT> Why do they require it? I can easily have the authentication not return user information and instead return 'guest'. What else relies on authentication?

I don't believe that this is impossible, but I'm struggling. From what I can tell it's a very common thing to show ALL users connected to a web app. For example think of a chat room that allows guests. How would I handle the connected user count of that using Laravel echo? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Getting guests into a presence channel using laravel echo server </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-11 11:28:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 
I am using laravel-echo-server to run Laravel Echo to broadcast events.

I have a user counter channel which shows all the users on the app. For this I am using a presence channel. This works fine for logged in users, but guests just never get connected.

I've setup the below in the BroadcastServiceProvider:

    Broadcast::channel('global', function () {
            return ['name' = 'guest'];
        });

Which from what I can tell, should allow everyone in as 'guests'. I'm guessing there's some middleware or auth that's being checked before this that I need to disable for this channel.

Any help on getting all clients joining this presence channel would be much appreciated!

	<TEXT> I've found all mods seem to impact the crafting menu quite heavily, most notably on searching for items and having large lists of item results on the left.

From what I can see, the game dispatches a search query AS SOON AS the search term is changed.

This means that while typing the word 'steel' the game first fires a serach query for 's' then for 'st' and so on beore finally giving me results for 'steel'

Because the short term search (single character) can still be quite useful, I'd suggest that the search filter waits, perhaps 200ms when the input is changed before running the query. This would give me time to write 'steel' before the game starts searching.

One thing you should have a think about is how your app store page is digested by potential players. Currently the first 4 images in the app store are almost exactly the same - you should be showing off your gameplay and exciting screenshots ASAP to get people hooked into a download. 

Best of luck with your game

This will tell you which views and partial views are being loaded on a given page. Along with many other insightful features.

Your workflow here seems a bit strange though, if you're modifying views of which the usage you're unsure. Really you should be identifying which views need to be updated based on the front end of the website and then finding their location via debugbar. </TEXT>

For me (and perhaps other users) I'm not going to shell out 3 for a game which is promising to be HARD. If you're going to try get me hooked via frustration and reward, it really should be for free.

You should start asking for money from players once they're hooked, have a hang of the game, etc.

How about the first 5 levels free, remaining bundle of levels via IAP for 3? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't use Vue very often, but off the top of my head I'd imagine you'd bundle up your translations then pass them as json to your vue component? 

Would probably want a quite specific structure to your translations as to only send required translation to the component but from what I understand Vue wants you to work in that way anyway (small components, isolated. etc) </TEXT>

I'm not sure how you would cache a page if the localization were driven from the client, it's never going to be as fast as being served a flat cached page and I'm struggling to see any advantage to handling something like this in JS.

It would be a pretty unique use case if users are switching between languages enough that a page reload would be inconvenient  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A fair call to be honest. Laravel is getting faster and faster and if the requests per second is the reason you're not using laravel then Lumen probably isn't going to run you for that much longer anyway.

If your API needs over 600 requests per second and can't deal with that through caching, PHP probably isn't the best choice. </TEXT>

Tends to make it a bit less sloppy in parts with a nice warm BBQ taste throughout.

I like to use quite chunky smokey BBQ sauce with my pulled pork, but I'm sure it works for any type. Really helps the pork not feel so wet. Looks like a great sandwich though! And I'm with you on the no slaw, however pickle is a must for me! </TEXT>

Previously, I have tried to get all my private keys out of QT and load them into multidoge - However multidoge syncs and then thinks I only have 9k doge (should be 150k).

I guess that's because I missed exporting one of my addresses? Ive literally done it 4 times and I'm sure I got all the addresses :(

That's why I'm reallllly hoping the QT wallet finds my coin :(

Cheers for tip!

	<TEXT> I've been trying to sync my wallet for almost 4 days now. I'm on a 1gb connection and have used bootstrap.dat to speed it up.

I'm on OSX, if it makes a difference. It seems to get through maybe 20 weeks of data every 12 hours.

I would use multidoge however my wallet sync on multidoge constantly gives me the wrong balance so I'm trying to recover my coins using QT.

Any suggestions to make this feasible?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What happens here is when you then want to use your model 'Blog' inside your 'Blog' Controller you're going to have to alias it in the use statement, which can create confusion and kind of forces you back to a different name on your model anyway. Far more annoying.

For example

    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use App\Blog as BlogModel;

    class Blog extends Controller {}

So it's best to probably keep a convention for naming controllers, because to me at least, you want to keep your models being called by their actual class name instead of an alias.
