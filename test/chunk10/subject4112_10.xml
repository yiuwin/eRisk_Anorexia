	<TITLE> Rules of Engagement - This show is a Glitch in the Matrix </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-18 07:42:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For a few years now, I've been watching a show called Rules of Engagement when I get home from work on TV. It stars David Spade and that Puddy guy from Seinfeld.   
  
 It's been in syndication for a few years now and it's grown on me, but one thing always bugged me. At NO point do I ever remember this show being a prime time show. I honestly cannot recall a time when this show aired on TV in a regular manner other than my recollection of it being on some OTA HD .4 channel at 6pm.   
The show appears to center around Adam and Jen, an engaged couple, but it relies heavily on the supporting characters which becomes evident as the episodes progress. (This is the only way I can tell what part of the series I'm looking at, the focus on the Adam/Jen relationship vs. everybody else)
 
When I look at other shows that are broadcast at this perfect post-work happy hour of TV watching, those popular shows from yesteryear, I see the likes of Everybody loves Raymond, King of Queens, Frasier, Friends, Seinfeld, Big Bang Theory...all shows that I remember having their moments in the sun. But Rules of Engagement?   
At this point I'm convinced there's more to this...did some nefarious being erase a huge part of our collective conscience and replace it with the idea that the guy from the Tick made a somewhat successful comeback?  
Or did David Spade actually make a comeback??    

  
Does anybody remember when this show actually existed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're probably right. It's the same director John McTiernan that directs both movies.   
  
However one could argue that some unknown plotline exists in which the Gruber brothers have a thing for green trucks with oceanic names or a hatred of couriers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Small world ...a girl I went to school with auditioned for the main girls part in War of the buttons. She didn't get the part but I remember thinking the girl that got the part was the spitting image of her so they obviously had a look in mind.   
  
The only reason I've seen Last of the High Kings was that It was filmed on the same road my cousins lived on in Howth. Their dog is actually in the opening scene wandering down the road. I don't remember the film being that good though, maybe I was too young to really appreciate it.   
  
Into the West is grand. It's really corny but a good watch. *"Tito, Tito my legs feel like jelly!"*   
  
Veronica Guiren is a great film. I loved the General too which you included on your first list. Haven't seen Hunger so I must check that one out.  </TEXT>

I remember researching Number One Music a few years ago when this all first started but as it seemed to be in an earlier stage there was a lot of confusion as to whether there was any legitimacy to it. I'll be honest I didn't do any new research and thought I'd reach out on here since I noticed a a lot of new Number One Music accounts messaging me lately.

	<TEXT> It's truly amazing how we reason things to ourselves. It was only after I realized I could reason the addiction the opposite way and start thinking in terms of how much $ or how many cigarettes a pack of day works out that I was able to get this point.   
I'm quitting cold turkey. So no vape/e cigs. But I smoke weed which has been a lifesaver because there would be a trail of murder victims in my wake if I didn't have that to fall back on.    
  
My wife telling me I smell great everyday has been one of the best outcomes of quitting. It makes me feel like I really stank the last 15 years. She also said that she has only ever known me as a smoker. That was so sad to hear it was a great motivator. I would also like to add that I read 2 chapters of Alan Carr's book and even though I never finished it, it definitely planted the seed that grew into me quitting a few months later. I highly recommend it to anybody needing a push in the right direction.   
  
  
I'm ranting on top of your rant. I'm sorry dude. Fuck cigarettes. Fuck anything that would make you feel this shitty trying to quit.  We got this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome! Great job. Today is Day 15 of me not smoking after spending the last 15 years of my life smoking a pack a day. That's basically $150 in my pocket that I wouldn't have had. (and currently I'm not that flush with cash, I've actually forgotten how I was budgeting my cigarettes since I'm still broke not smoking!!)  
But the best way that helps me continue is that I have smoked (by the end of today) 300 less cigarettes. That's 300 cigarettes that have not been inhaled. That is a disgustingly large amount. If I saw 300 cigarettes laid out in front of me I'd probably puke.   

Just had a bad craving and came to this sub for support. Was thrilled to see your post. 1095 days gives me so much hope.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have had a Reverbnation account for a few years. I think that somewhere in the early days of setting this up I might've accidentally linked into a NumberOneMusic website through Reverbnation. Alternatively, they created an account for me automatically??? Since then I get emails from people praising me (that's the weird part) for my music. Are they getting paid to listen to me? Is this all part of a larger scam? Should I delete this account or just let it play out? Honestly it's somewhat flattering getting random emails from internet strangers about songs I've written but I'm wondering if it's at all legit or just another internet scam. Anybody have a similar story?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I'm a somewhat recent transplant from the NE so I can give you maybe a little insight.  
1)I live in the Richardson area of North Dallas. We had originally moved to West Plano. As far as crime goes, they are both VERY safe neighborhoods. Plano especially. As long as you have a smart head on your shoulders it really isn't much of an issue in my opinion.   
2) I find people in the south to be very friendly. However that doesn't mean they can't be assholes. Down here people will  be nice to your face all day but I've seen a lot of backstabbing going on. Whereas up north people just let you know straight off the bat that they don't like you. If you like the upfront nature of people you'll miss that a little.   
3)THIS WILL BREAK YOU. If traffic is a deal breaker then you might want to look elsewhere. I've never experience the likes of it. People in Dallas drive like they are auditioning for Mad Max. Locals claim Houston is worse...so Houston must actually be hell on earth. If you can find a place close to where you will work you will be a lot happier. I swapped a 45minute - 15 mile commute for a 1 mile - 3minute commute and I still dread having to do anything after work that involves driving (going to store etc.) just constant traffic.   
4)I rent an awesome place for next to nothing. Not sure on housing market but rental communities are abundant. Some of them are overpriced for what you are getting but if you look hard you'll find something reasonable.   
5)One thing Texas definetely has going for it is the job market. It's almost as if the recession didn't touch here (i know it did) but there are so  many corporate HQ's in the area and Data Centers being built in N Dallas, there is an active job market (compared to other parts of the country)  
6)It's Texas. The summers are brutal. However the trade off is really nice Fall, Winter, Spring.   
  
Just a few other things.   
You will need a car. Relying on public transport here is very tough. It's good but could be better. The DART train line is probably the most convenent transportation, the busses could be a lot better.  Nobody walks. Anywhere. Being a pedestrian is a dangerous hobby. 

Probably not a deal breaker but one thing that I miss about the NE is a sense of nature. Dallas is a very modern city. It's not a western city at all. It's clean, people take care of their houses and properties around here but if you are a fan of hiking and trail walking etc. You have to drive out of the area to get to it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They have a minesweeper in their inventory ...Let that sink in. 


I couldn't get a good copy of the spreadsheet linked. Link to website at the bottom. 
  
But some highlights:  

49 x $10,747 Night Vision glasses.     
$658,000 Mine Resistant Vehicle (unsure of sweeping capabilities)  
The cherry on top (literally) $1,967,301 Airplane - Cargo Transport!!!     
  

  
I can see a police department needing a helicopter ($922,704). Expensive but probably necessary. But almost $2 million on a Cargo plane. I guess it's cheaper than shipping all the night vision glasses. 

This database hasn't been updated in a while. Original link for the curious. http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/database-shows-what-military-equipment-your-local-police-department-has-been-stockpiling_08192014 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People love to shit on that movie but if I have a choice between 1 or 2 , I'll go 2 every time. It's got better comedic lines because it is self aware in how ridiculous the plot is. Don't get me wrong, 1 is a masterpiece but that shouldn't take away from 2 being a great sequel . Sure 3 was great and I enjoyed 4. 5 should be stricken from the record. But Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a joy to watch and just saying that you like Die Hard 2 makes people stop and think, hey maybe I should watch that again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a quick solution by any means, but having lived in that area for a long time and seeing the weekly antics I agree with you that something needs to be done.   

I think it'll have to come down to changing drinking laws from 21 to 18.   
Telling people they need to be 21 to consume alcohol when they can go to war/vote/drive and do every other adult activity at 18 means we are prolonging their sense of "childhood". We're making them go outside the law to participate in an adult activity even though they are adults. We expect these students to be adults when they arrive at college but they're not. They have had to sneak around high school going to parties and getting drunk because they are "children". Then they get sent off to college and are all of a sudden expected to be adults. But we don't treat them like adults. The schools are rampant with rules that will seek to control them. So when the nights roll around or the weekend they feel like they need to rebel. So they drink and party because they know they aren't allowed to.   
If the legal drinking age was 18, i think you'll find the novelty of drinking will be much less among that demographic. Sure the first year or two you'll see a lot of 18/19 year olds take advantage of the new law. But they already are, just illegally. Once you give them the legal right to do it, the sense of rebellion is no longer there. Then they move off the streets and away from the house parties and they drink themselves into oblivion like any other member of society, at a bar or on their couch, alone.  </TEXT>

Savino had been part of the Barksdale organization so Omar would've been aware of him.   
Michael was a special addition to Marlo's crew. He was Chris's protege and wasn't involved in their day to day dealing on the corners so this is probably why Omar never knew of him. </TEXT>
