	<TEXT> Well let me clarify that I'm not a pyromaniac and my interest comes from my passion of experiencing new things/situations.

And a flamethrower is on my list besides fire breathing. It seems like a mighty feeling to ignite a giant flame with just a trigger. And the axes are a creative idea, we will propably not realise it but it seemed like a cool alternative.

I'll certainly do! If there are further questions I'll answer them all glady. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha thanks for checking up on me! I'm doing fine haven't burnt myself to death. As for the flamethrower, I still haven't found a place or someone who we can try it from but my buds also joint the hunt. If we can't find one anywhere we'll just have to make our own! I did come up with the idea of throwing axes with which we could light their head on fire. I guess you could technically still call that flamethrowing  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Is there a program that automatically syncs your spotify library with your soundcloud likes ? For example: When I add song A to my spotify library it will automatically like song A on soundcloud?
Is there a program that does this between multiple networks? Such as Spotify, Soundcloud, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. (Facebook as in liking the artist, snapchat as in following the official account. When I follow an artist on spotify)
Currently I have to do it all manually but since my taste is quite eclectic it would really save me a lot of work. </TEXT>
