	<TEXT> I'm looking for some books about pre-WWII Russia, specifically about gulags. Are there any books written by survivors or give an account of life in a gulag? Honestly, even a fact-based fictional story would be good too. Coming from a country where we can be open about our ideas and speak freely, I have always been intrigued by stories of oppression. Also, the secretive nature of gulags has me very curious  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The founders wanted a President who was politically involved and aware of current issues. Nowadays we can follow politics and issues from anywhere in the world, but back then they had no idea what was going on around the world until weeks after it happened. So by making sure that the President was a resident, they ensured that he/she knew what was going on. 

Just one possible theory </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He appealed to the common American and seemed down to Earth to most Americans. Also, the 80's were a period of economic prosperity which is commonly associated with him, so people were happy because they had money. He also was very strong with regards to the Cold War and the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which made most Americans respect him and trust him. 

Years later though, we see that some of his policies turned out to be ineffective and have lasting negative impacts on America (ex. Reaganomics, War on Drugs), which is why he isn't as well-accepted nowadays.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The people at the time weren't necessarily opposed to a central figure, they were opposed to an oppressive central figure with too much power. Everyone in the U.S. loved Washington at the time, so this helped to assuage their fears of an overly-powerful central figure. The system that the Constitution originally set up included more state power with the 10th amendment being the driving factor. So in the time period, states did have more rights. 

The federalists also had the backing of large states like Virginia through James Madison. He along with Alexander Hamilton published the Federalist Papers, which convinced smaller states as well as the general population that a strong centralized government was ideal for the new country.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If Ramsey could control the ball we'd be doing so much better. He's making amazing runs but can't do anything with the ball when he gets it because he lacks control.

Ozil has been pretty great

Aside from that horrendous back pass, Holding looks great.

Alexis continually giving the ball away and then whining when Ramsey didn't pull it back to him really made me mad. 

Our right side looks great as a whole so far. I think we can break through via Ox. 

Overall surprised we're actually creating chances. Expected them to come out lacking determination and passion.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking for a book that discusses the dynamics and characteristics of several different ancient civilizations. I've gotten very bored in class recently, and have taken to browsing Wikipedia in my free time, looking at this kind of stuff. In addition, high school social studies curriculums don't really talk about this kind of stuff, which has only furthered my curiosity.

I know the basics of these societies, but I'd like to learn more about the political, social, and societal dynamics of these civilizations. I'm assuming there are books that go into detail about ancient civilizations but I'm not sure where to start looking, and I thought it would be worthwhile to try r/history for some suggestions.  </TEXT>

Gonzaga should be up by a lot more honestly. A lot of wide open misses, and Karnowski should have made a lot of these looks he's getting within 3 feet.

	<TEXT> ND is the perfect remedy to beat Press Virginia. Fast guards, smart players, low TO %, and good free throw shooting. I take ND in that matchup, but at the moment I'm thinking WVU doesn't even make it past the first round. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why would he take 8mil with the Browns when he could come to Washington and pad his stats this year with an actual QB? Then when Kirk leaves, he leaves and gets a bigger deal, or on the off chance we re-sign Kirk next year then he would most likely get re-signed too.  </TEXT>

Draw City and lose

Finish 4th in the league

Wenger signs one year extension

Ozil stays and everyone calls him overrated and horrible

Alexis leaves to PSG

Ospina, Gabriel, and Gibbs leave

Woj and Wilshere come back

We sign Lacazette for a lot of money and a new LB who is young with potential 

Barely manage to qualify for Champions League after losing the first leg of the qualifier and coming from behind to win in the second leg
