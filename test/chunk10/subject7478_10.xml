	<TEXT> I see.

There are a few UFO cases where I think non-human tech (I personally prefer this term over things like non terrestrial intelligence when discussing UFOs) **might** be cause:

JAL 1628 and the Coyne UFO incident, if they happened exactly as the witnesses said, and they aren't lying, they weren't drugged, etc.

 As for the abduction phenomenon, I only mentioned that to draw a parallel between this thread and that in terms of how sometimes r/UAP is willing to discuss stuff we can't always physically observe or prove ourselves. 

You might like r/ebes, which is a somewhat *serious* sub that involves possible non-terrestrial intelligences. 

Here are my contributions over there: https://www.reddit.com/r/EBEs/search?q=author%3Asubject7478 restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all

I'm very interested in UFOs and possible non-terrestrial intelligences. I love to speculate regarding these things, but there have been no definitive UFO cases that make me convinced, though the aforementioned cases are good contenders, I guess. 

 one has to have an opinion if nothing else that leads them to believe in non terrestrial intelligence being linked to the phenomenon.

Well, if there are non-terrestrial intelligences out there, maybe they won't need to use physical UFOs, who knows.

You might enjoy the following sites: 

http://thenightshirt.com/ focuses more on this stuff, I guess, a more Fortean website. 

And this site as well: http://parasociology.blogspot.com/

Regarding any Govt programs (ex Moon Dust), my personal view is that though govts/militaries may have some photos/radar, they don't know much more than that.

They might know weird shit is happening, but other than that, they don't have much to analyze, and are left to speculate like everyone else.

I guess if they're smart, they'll have passive photo/video/sensors near things like nuke bases (which might be UFO hot spots like Hastings points out), but I don't think they've ever been in possession of a *UFO*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   The next day , possibly related, there was "Mobile command center" parked in the spot right under where we saw the lights. It was definitely enough to make us paranoid.

OP, it sounds like you saw a military aerostat:

	<TEXT> Do you have any specific claims of his you want addressed?

I think Randle focuses on Roswell, which is a massive clusterfuck of misinformation and straight up lies.

I don't know if anything of importance will come of it.

Randle has done a good job explaining that whatever did crash at Roswell wasn't a Project Mogul balloon: http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/search/label/Project%20Mogul

But maybe it was something else that was confidential. Humans have put a lot of weird shit in space:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachinePorn/comments/44c1ud/ov108_pascomsat_gridsphere_satellite_when/

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachinePorn/comments/44c33l/static_inflation_test_of_echo_satellite_in/

Regarding Roswell, I don't think the US has "faster than light" or anti-gravity machines, I don't think it was ETH. 

I think some technology of the US might've crashed, and then a mythology of aliens was built up around it, in this specific case. Whether that is intentional or not is up for debate, and who honestly knows?

Consider whether the US wanted to hoax a crashed alien flying saucer...they could do that with ease.

Regarding Abductions, I don't think there is very much to it. 

For more on that, check out Jack Brewer's blog and book:

Agreed. A lot of missed potential between these two characters. 

 That said, I've watched the mythology episodes sequentially, ignoring all other episodes, and it flows really well - and cohesively and dramatically - until you get to the first feature film. 

For me, once you see Agent Diana Fowley, that's the beginning of the end.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1. Deep Throat: try to think back to the initial mythology episodes. They were so mysterious, giving off only bits if the bigger puzzle here and there. And Jerry Hardin as Deep Throat was instrumental in building up the initial serialized plot. Then they kill him off, and in some ways, the Mythology episodes were never the same. CSM is a great character, but he never had the gravitas that Deep Throat had.

2. X: after Deep Throat, Mulder's next quasi ally was X. He was a bit more coarse than Deep Throat, but he still seemed like a good guy. But then he's killed off as well.

3. Krycek: who doesn't love him, even though he's an asshole? Kyrcek was a simple man, pursuing power and money. A mercenary. Then he's killed off.

4. The Well Dressed Man (the British Guy): the boss it seemed. Even giving orders to CSM. But then he's killed of in the first film.

(Maybe the showrunners should have brought back Strughold)

All in all, the Mythology episodes had a lot of potential, but they kept unnecessarily killing off great characters, and leaving us with things like "Super soldiers".

So much missed potential. </TEXT>

 it was odd to feel like I didn't have control of my body. I've never experienced sleep paralysis before

First time for everything. 

Or...maybe the dream/experience has more significance. Dreams are subjective and personal, so it's up to you to decide.

The 2nd incident(s): Dogs do weird things all the time, so don't place *too* much weight on their actions. OTOH, don't dismiss it outright. As you said, "I understand it could be anything.. but who knows."

Now the incidents with the lights...Are you a sleepwalker? Maybe a faulty electrical system?

	<TITLE> TIL Richard Haines retired from NARCAP </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-28 02:46:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was recently going through Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos's informative, if disorganized, FOTOCAT website (fotocat.blogspot.com), when I found the following:


Haines Retires from NARCAP
Dr. Richard F. Haines, has announced his retirement as Chief Scientist for NARCAP as of January 1, 2017. In a communiqu, Haines has pointed out a number of things including: my age (I'm turning eighty this year in May), my desire to spend more time with my family, my realization that there are very few pilot reports being received involving both flight safety and UAP, my frustrations with certain aspects of running the science aspects of a volunteer organization, and some other more recent events which I will not discuss here. He goes on to complaint that over sixteen years ago I had thought that an organization such as NARCAPwould be able to make a difference in impacting aviation safety while also obtaining more reliable information on these ubiquitous and mysterious phenomena.  Perhaps we have made some small progress; however, the return-on-investment so to speak, is small indeed. Haines has done a scientific-level work in studying UFO phenomena, one of the most prominent in the world, and we owe him an immense debt of gratitude for his dedication.
This prompts me to add some general reflections on the state of the field today. Even organization-scale efforts have not revealed the slightest evidence that UFOs have an origin in outer space, which iswe cannot neglect thisthe motivating inspiration for most ufologists. Yes, there are mysterious events, few and far between, however these have failed to generate a testable theory. The fact that no cause-effect relationship has been found in major UFO airborne safety incidents doesnt support the notion of nearby, material objects or phenomena in the air. Finally, the well-intentioned change of the term UFO into UAPhoping to reach a larger scientific audienceserved little and no relevant achievement followed. This is the status of UFO research in 2017.

I appreciate all the work Haines has done for the field, even though a lot of it was pre-WWW. It's really a shame, he's done so much interesting research that's not accessible: http://docplayer.net/40002235-Published-articles-public-presentations-miscellaneous-reports-and-other-uap-related-writings-by-continuation-richard-f-haines-and.html

If you're willing to shell out some bucks, try to find some of his older books: https://www.amazon.com/Observing-Ufos-Investigative-Richard-Haines/dp/0882295403 (The used paperbacks are of course usually cheaper)

Though to be fair, he doesn't always get it right, as the following investigation (again, thanks to Ballester Olmos for bringing it to attention) displays (in French so use your browser's translate feature if needed): http://perso.numericable.fr/r.alessandri/ufologie/montreal.html

Anyway, thanks for your work Richard Haines! And thanks also to Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos! 

Two UFO researchers that bring respect to this field.  </TEXT>

Then Wade goes out, and he starts balling. Playing well consistently.

Wade comes back in again, and Niko's becomes a non-factor in most games.

So it would seem he would fit well on a team where he's the No. 2 scoring option.

I think he's a free agent this summer, so do y'all have any teams in mind where he would be a good fit? </TEXT>

Bad that doesn't exactly explain this. Shit IDK, about the slap incident.

  there were a lot of drugs, violent people, etc... so the whole place was just stagnating with bad energy. The tension between me and my mother didn't help, as we both had serious emotional problems at the time.

	<TEXT> The incidents with the kid's shoes and the lockdown makes it sound like you had precognitive dreams. 

Or as strangef8 said, it could be Synchronicity. 

 When I went in there later it smelled like almost an electrical fire smell..
 
Could be your brain's way of warning you to beware of leaving the plug in. Or your house/God/entity/good spirit warning you to beware of leaving the plug in.

 Another night DD1 woke up screaming like petrified in her crib. I swear swear swear I heard "shhhhh shhhhh" like almost pleading her o be quiet. I was convinced someone was in the room trying to kidnap her.

Maybe it was a friendly neighborhood ghost or your ancestor. Perhaps not a malicious entity as you think. 

 then she starts waving to god knows what.. i also have that on video. I mean in all honesty she could have been just waving for fun or something but it was weird AF!......Last night DD2 was staring behind me for so long.. then starting screaming.

Kids do weird shit all the time. Or again, maybe your friendly neighborhood ghost/ancestor. 

 So... am I just going crazy because of lack of sleep and these are all just weird coincidences?

1. You're not crazy. 
2. I don't think the events you mentioned are *all* just coincidences, though of course those happen all the time as well. Be skeptical, but keep an open mind. It sounds like you're having some precognitive dreams. 
3. I know it's difficult w/young kids around, but try to get some sleep to avoid events like the Vapor pad plug. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thankful for his older work, where he talks about UFO/Alien sightings caused by man-made (military/IC) hoaxes, but he loses me with his "Control System" hypothesis. 

There is no need for a theory that explains UFOs....and includes fairies, leprechauns, cryptids, etc. 

  Part of me gets it, but part thinks it's a cop out.

I get it as well, and I also think it's a cop out.

	<TEXT> It's good to be open minded, but also skeptical.

 I was up playing some video games when my dog starts barking in the kitchen. I go in and no one is in there. I go and sit down again, only to hear a crash as if pots and pans are being dropped. I don't investigate due to my own fears. 

Animals have great perception abilities. In this case, your dog may be sensing something anomalous (ghost)....or a mouse.

  one of my nieces toys goes off much in the quick way the XBox did. This toy needs to be squeezed hard to make a noise. It stopped when I touched it and started again when I put it back down. I have since moved it and it has not said anything so far. 

Electronics do weird shit from time to time. 

 One day, my family and I were sitting in the living room trying to decide what we wanted for dinner or something of the like, when we hear my XBox 360 pinging quickly. We look up and it's opening and closing quickly, I immediately get frustrated and told it to stop. It did immediately. 

Maybe there is something off with the electricity in your house, and it's physically/magnetically causing hallucinations/fear. Something akin to infrasound vibrations causing hallucinations, etc. 

 I was sleeping on one couch but my father, who works nights, was wide awake. He told me he looked up towards our stair case and saw a shadow walk up the stairs and into my would be bedroom....Nightly, I feel as if someone is watching me in my bedroom....There was another shadow encounter when my niece's father was over visiting his daughter. He said he had a feeling that he needed to look down the hall at my room, only to see a shadow walk into my room....

This might all be confirmation bias. Your dad might have inadvertently started the fright by telling you he saw a shadow man. This puts your family in a state of heightened alert, where you're easily spooked. 

Regarding ghost sightings that happen before/directly after sleep, it could be sleep paralysis, or you could still be dreaming. 

  We've even had someone walk past asking if we lived here, telling us the house was haunted.

Again, in a sense it may be haunted; try to look into electricity induced hallucinations/fright. Maybe get an electrician over. 

Anyway, try to take it easy. Even if your house is truly haunted, it doesn't sound like it's anything malevolent.

Keep an open mind, but be skeptical. Hope this may help. </TEXT>
