It's so hopeless and she has such a low amount of money going into retirement it's frightening to even imagine how she's going to make it through that and not be eating dog food in a dilapidated apartment in 10-15 years.  She probably should've made some better choices like getting out of the city a long time ago but it doesn't seem like she has any resources to even move. Hopefully she gets herself that in-home nurse job and starts making some decent money with a lot less running around, her situation is worrisome  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't even believe this video whatsoever. Notice how quick and abrupt this video begins and ends with his voice so low.

 I think those were down in the middle of that hallway, and Opie wheeled them over to his corner for a moment when no one was around to make this video and try to gain attention for himself because he thinks in his mind that's going to translate to lots of buzz, a news article, and eventually some other contract offer. He most likely thinks we even helped him out by giving the video more views because some journalist will see it and think it's worth writing about. I would wager this video is 0% genuine </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Watch an hour and a half or so of this some time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XExjrZxTdk

It's like watching a documentary from the 3rd Reich about the hero Hitler, it's circle-jerky but compared to the way we tell the story of World War II it's equally as much of a circle-jerk. You see the entire thing from Hitler's perspective and Germany's perspective, how much of the war wasn't really based on anti-Jewish sentiment as much as that was just one factor under the umbrella of the greater overall anti-Communist sentiment that the war was really about. Looking back on the damage Communism did to Eastern Europe one can at least understand what Hitler and the Germans' paranoia was about at the time. It also shows from their perspective why they went into Poland, and has some factual information in it that personally I've never learned about in school at all like the Ha'aavara Agreement when the Nazi party financed Jews to be able to leave Germany and move to Palestine </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've worked overnight baking before in an upscale grocery store, it's pretty fun but I wouldn't want to do it beyond 30. You'll be able to listen to O A or whatever you want on loud all night, have the place to yourself (my store was 24 hours but baking dept didn't have to help anyone in the early morning), usually there are no bosses around during those hours, and it's a pretty relaxed job to do. Gets a little tedious after awhile, but for each season there is a different lineup of breads to make and there's room for creativity at some places where you can come up with your own recipes and see if they sell.

 The problem is that depending on where you work, right at the very end of your day is the morning when the business opens up and everyone piles in to get breakfast stuff. If you're short staffed or extra busy you'll end up having to help them get through a breakfast rush so the most stressful / busiest part of your days are right at the very end. Other than that it's a lot of fun especially if you are under or around 25. It's good during the summer, I would usually go outside every couple hours for a puff of that Joe Rogan which made work enjoyable, then you get out first thing in the morning and have all day until 4-5pm to do whatever </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've wondered that too and I don't think so. I'm convinced his fascination with swastikas and German WWII attire actually comes from neo-Nazi / KKK type groups adapting the symbols and colors for themselves after the war as opposed to directly from an interest in the orginal anti-Communist symbol / Hitler's Germany or the Wehrmacht. Judging from the usage of blackface in the early 90s with Rotgut I always suspected Anthony's been involved in Niggermania.com type of stuff for decades, before the internet even </TEXT>

#O A meet Homeless Mustard
##featuring Patrice and DeRosa


###Rundown

[Source](http://www.struff.com/vbulletin/showthread.php/46702-12-11-09-Rundown-NYC-Shooting-New-Birthday-Greeting-2010-Glasses-Intern-Challenge-Patrice-Oneal-Joe-DeRosa-in-Studio-Homeless-Guys-Joe-Mustard)

* They start off with sound effects including gunshots and police sirens and Homer Simpson yelling frantically, all of which leads them into talking about a fatal shooting in Times Square yesterday about three blocks away from their office. 

* They [watch a news report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LOmG9PAJAs) gun-wielding victim's mother wanting to know why the cop didn't shoot her son in the leg instead of the chest. Then another news story about the shooting. 

* They talk about the "2010" glasses like that talked about yesterday. O A disagree over ways the glasses can be made. 

* Someone sends in the binary number for 2010 and O A like it so they suggest an intern make glasses with it. Opie also wants an intern to make regular "2010" glasses. 

BREAK

* Opie says that they will announce the mall for the Homeless Shopping Spree Monday. 

* Keith The Cop calls: He is bringing new homeless guys up into the studio, but one them may have fallen asleep in a bathroom. 

* They watch a new TV birthday greeting. Kevin From Conn. He found the birthday greeting and credits the person on youtube. 

* They talk about today's news about Tiger Woods about a broad he allegedly paid $60,000 for and reports that he may give up golf to save his marriage.

* Patrice Oneal calls: He is on his way to the studio but wants to comment about the $60,000 chick first.

* Ant does his Tiger-waking-up bit. 

* Sam tells O A about the interns and their project to create 2010 glasses and some behind-the-scenes backstabbing.

* The interns present their New Years Glasses designs.

* [Patrice joins them in the studio with Joe DeRosa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3xliingBw t=1h51m35s) and tries to come up with some ideas of his own. 

BREAK


* People are obsessed with making 2010 glasses. Opie says that Joe's are the worst. 


* Joe plugs his band's upcoming CD release party. 


* Keith The Cop joins in the studio. He has two new homeless guys.

* The first guy they talk to is named Joe; he tells them about himself and says that he has been homeless off and on since 1996 because of heroin although he is clean now. 

* The next homeless guy is named Mustard. [He was in a Metallica video as one of three wise men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHVv7Mz2_Bo)

* They talk with the homeless guys for a while longer. Among other things they find out that Mustard has a Facebook page which he updates at the library and that he bites people on the street. 

* They give Mustard a guitar and he plays with it and sings a song. Everyone liked his song. A lot. 

* [He plays a cover of Radiohead's Creep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXlzci1rKNM)

* Everyone loves it. Opie throws him some money. 

* He does another song. After it ends Opie says that he would fund a CD for Mustard and then hilarity ensues at the thought of Mustard being drunk and all messed up in a recording studio.

BREAK

* Opie says that they shouldn't have gone to break because they never really stopped. They try to recap some of the hilarity which includes joking about John Mayer stealing Mustard's songs. 

* They go off on the scenario of Mustard being drunk in a recording studio and trashing the place - Ant uses his megaphone and sound effects of destruction are added. 

* They [read a report about Snooki being punched on Jersey Shore](http://www.today.com/popculture/snooki-s-attacker-jersey-shore-identified-wbna34381082)

* They [watch a video of her being punched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXic2dG_ymY)

* Most of the rest of the show has more silliness and goofing around and a lot of ball-busting around things like a movie spoiler and the question of whether or not they would die for their chicks.

We want to watch baseball not water polo, but we don't want to watch little league tee-ball either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe they are trying a new strategy of trying to get ratings based solely on hate-watching. First they put the show out, then all the anti-SJW YouTubers review it with clips, then the ratings grow over time. They certainly don't care if Moshe Kasher's career is ruined, or if SJW values are accepted by society, all they care about is getting eyes on their show and if that means exploiting SJWs to a satirical level just so everyone watches to shit on it, they'd probably do it with no hesitation

That MC Serch cringe music video just seemed so incredibly corny and over the top I would be surprised if nobody noticed how terrible it was and put it out deliberately

If this theory is at all true, Kosher is a complete fucking short-sighted idiot  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Get TamperMonkey, you can get it for any browser (Mozilla, Chrome, Opera) by Googling TamperMonkey

It's the same thing as what Greasemonkey was, basically just an addon that you can add scripts to that will act as addons or enhancers etc for webpages.

Then, once you have TamperMonkey installed get this script: 

https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/27182-youtube-download-mp4-mp3-3gp-all-format-1920-1080-720

* Once you have TamperMonkey installed there will be a green button on that page that says "install" and you are all set. 

Then go to YouTube on any video and you'll see this:

http://imgur.com/mjQ3tF1

* You can download any videos in audio-only .m4a and they work on iPhones or you can play them on Android easily with a few different Android media players that can play m4a. 

* No need to convert it from video to audio or anything like that

* There's a MP3 option but it has length limits I think

Probably sounds complicated but this only takes like 5 minutes tops and really comes in handy, especially for radio/podcasts that upload to YouTube </TEXT>

	<TITLE> It seems as though the Police Chief in Berkeley, CA ordered officers to stand down during the rally/protest yesterday. Is this something that happens often? How do you guys feel about it? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was watching this video and [this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe4-7IgMbsg t=17m32s) came up, showing a guy going up to ask a few officers, who look to be (at least IMO) rather frustrated or at least bored, and you can sort of hear one of them say something about the chief before the other gives a more 'official' response. 

The last time that this occurred in Berkeley, a lot of people were questioning why those officers didn't intervene in the rioting / burning / looting that was going on. Another strange thing about this was that the Trump rallygoers were searched and disarmed before entering the park and when Antifa marched in they were not searched, had fireworks and explosives, rocks etc. and when they broke down the line the police had set up, nothing was done in response.

Is it possible that their chief would order them to stand down? What exactly would be the reasoning or motive to do that? Have you ever been in a similar situation as this and how would that make you guys feel as officers if you were told to go to an event where violence may occur and be told not to intervene? </TEXT>

0:00  Dance routine of women in uniform and combat boots, intersting in a 1940s-50s dance number movie sort of way

5:00  Museum of something about westerners and spying equipment? The dangers of using commercial electronics, maybe using them to spy on you?

10:30  Boy and mother being brainwashed by a (Catholic?) priest and then the priest kills the boy, obviously about how dangerous western religions are

18:30  ode to the patriotic tractor? Ends in a reference to 1955

20:00  Ebullient woman talking about making clothes, complete with lots of certificates of some sort commentary and scenes about making fabric and clothes.

29:30  Rock mining. People drilling rocks, and rock being dumped as fill? I couldnt tell if this was about the rock being used, or if it was about making a tunnel

35:00  A bunch of images of people working, marching, doing things with a soundtrack of singing. Getting a little glazed eyed here. The Great Leader is shown directing some activities with great vigor.

37:45  Something about the early earth and its creation, with comets raining down and life evolving, fossils. Cuts to animatronic dinosaurs in a museum. Ah, it is a museum on natural history.

48:00  Two very young children playing a duet on the piano, they look to be 5-6.

51:00  Child (8-10) dancing with a stick, somersaulting, spinning,

54:00  Two very young children playing a duet on stringed instruments

56:30  Young girl (8-10?) choir singing a song and playing harmonica, move over K-Pop, youve been replaced

58:30  More very young kids, this time boys and girls, doing an outdoors dance and song routine </TEXT>

Is it normal and regular for the media to report every single time when someone uses any type of Nazi-related or Hitler-related attempt at comedy anywhere a comedian references that? Because I see those types of jokes plenty, and they're not in the news cut into a piece where the clips are flashed before you with no context. Also, you'd be naive to believe that anyone sitting on a train scrolling through articles on their way to work or reading the news on lunch is going to find each source, click, go to the timestamp, and watch every video referenced to get the full idea of what was happening as opposed to just reading the article, watching the video they cut together, and moving to the next article. </TEXT>

I am a fan of Donald Trump, still am, and I am just questioning this Syria narrative. I know for a FACT HIllary would've gone along with it every step of the way happily which is why I voted for Donald because there is more of a chance of him figuring things out than any of the other candidates

If I had to vote again today I would STILL vote for Trump over Hillary for everything else he stands for.

	<TEXT> This game has so much potential.. the more we build this place up here, the better we can build a pretty big community for it and it will attract lots of other people. Many in the pubs might not know about the subreddit but once we gather together, we will probably see more clans/teams being built, get to know each other better, see more new people feeling encouraged to join/buy the game.. they will see a populated sub  and figure there must be something good going on with this game. 

Let's set a goal...  share this sub around the Infamy servers and with anyone you play games with, and see if we can get that number of "Users here now" (which is basically the users that have been here in the past 15 or so minutes) up to around 50 average. The current seems to be around 10-15 but let's build this game up and get something fun going, It's a good game for it and it will keep getting more engaging as we make it a bustling community! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The game is very high skill based. I started playing it yesterday morning on my day off, probably have played like 8 hours since then, and finally around the 6-8 hour mark it was starting to click and I was learning my ways around the maps and everything. The classes finally made sense, I wasn't getting shot in the back as much since I knew where people were coming from, and even had a few of my own streaks. Took a little while and was frustrating for a bit but it's extra rewarding when you get to that point where it clicks.

This game is pure old school skill. Map knowledge, reaction time, quick wit, and accuracy rule the roost. No laser strikes and jetpacks and random pointless pay-for cosmetics just the classic magic of a great FPS.

As someone who was brought up with games like that (DoD1.3/CS1.6) this game is a huge refreshment and I think we will see a high growth in the future due to this! People are craving this type of game in a landscape where it's hard to find. When they learn about this they'll flock to it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know what it is, but I have a Chromecast that just sits on the screensaver mode doing slideshows of whatever the latest news stories are. I noticed that they are trying intensely to get people to listen to random podcasts ever since the legacy media's smearfest on alternative media started up after the election. S-Town was one of the ones I've seen them suck the dick of among a few others as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol it was a lot of fun, the whole comp community knew each other pretty well and the entire thing was built on shit talking so it was pretty funny. This game wouldn't appeal to a lot of them I don't think, because it's way more slow paced and tactical than 1.3 was.

There's a game called [Days of War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiCfiWiHWa4) that was looking like it'd be the perfect successor to DoD and fill the competitive WWII game rift, except I guess from what I've heard it's totally unplayable right now because they have terrible anti-cheat and people are running around with invincibility on etc

This game (Days of Infamy) truly feels like someone took what DoD 1.3's realism was trying to emulate and fill all the parts that took imagination and put it all in the game. Big maps, ironsights, no crosshairs, a necessity to work as a team, smoke grenades, airstrikes that need 2 people to coordinate together to be effective etc. I think you'll probably love it (if you haven't gotten into it already) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I played DoD 1.3 in CAL/TPG not the realism mode the 6v6 20min/half mode, and you will probably like this game, as it caters far more to realism than it does to the CALeague version we used to play </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tip (short video): Use Steam's "Launch Options" feature to force mouse settings for the smoothest mouse settings without interference like acceleration etc. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I use these commands for ALL Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 (Source) based games. These settings are extremely effective for Half-Life 1 games (DoD 1.3, CS 1.6 etc.) because even when you go into Mouse Options and change the settings, it still isn't completely free of the Windows/Apple interference on having precision mouse movement.

I do not have a certainty that they are totally needed since this game is new to me, and maybe someone with experience who knows about these commands can confirm or deny that they are a help with regards to Source-based games or DoI, but I do set all my games like this by default because it will make your mouse movement totally free of any Windows/Apple-based mouse interference.

To share, here is a quick video on how to do this:

The launch options: 

-noforcemaccel -noforcemparms -noforcemspd

Enjoy. These also work for any Source-related games, and especially for all HL1 engine games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We can do it. Did you play 1.3 or source? and was it competitive like GotFrag and CAL/TPG or the 7v7 realism version? I never got much into the realism side of things but am open to it. For this game I think we could attract the most people by somehow marrying both that action packed, fast paced 6v6 comp play with the realism side that this game is very welcoming of </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all. I am just getting into Day of Infamy. I played Day of Defeat (1.3) in CAL over a decade ago up until around 2010... it was a 6v6 game, 15-20 minutes on each side, based on DoD's multiple flag CTF system.

Anyone want to start discussing how to get a competitive community built? (i.e. best system for competitive play, getting a league going, establishing a place for teams to come and find scrims etc, create a map list with the best maps that would be tailored for comp matches etc) </TEXT>
