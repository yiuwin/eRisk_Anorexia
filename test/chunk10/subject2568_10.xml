	<TEXT> Hey. I posted here asking if i would look better if i lost weight. (Check my history for pix if youre curious). 

You guys told me i didnt need to lose anything but i felt like i was fat still and you told me i might have anorexia. I went to a doctor and i got diagnosed. Im now on a new diet and its really tough. I cant eat much food without feeling horrible and i feel like im getting fatter and fatter and uglier and uglier still. I know people say im not but it still feels that way. Ive gone up from 96lbs to 110 since. I have alot more energy now to do stuff. Before i just layed at home doing nothing but reading and homework..

 just wanna say thank you guys that you helped me on the right path! 
Heres some update pix, hope i look a little different atleast.:)
