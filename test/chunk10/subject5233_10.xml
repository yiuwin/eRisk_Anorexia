	<TEXT> To be fair they could have doubled the highstick to the shield with a dive. No way that hurt since it glanced his shield lol. But the too many men and delay are textbook. I've seen a lot of players get away with some of these other calls in a playoff atmosphere. I understand how you feel but hey it's still 1 - 0. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are forgetting the league has Brad Marchand who has come close to ending many careers with premeditated awful trips/slewfoots. And a league that is okay with players who's only job is to go out and throw cheapshots/fight and can barely skate. Soooo let's call it emotional problems. Dotchin isn't a saint but he's a solid dman and played great D for us. Hope he quits his late hits and bad hits but come on... let's not pretend hes the worst thing to ever happen LOL </TEXT>
