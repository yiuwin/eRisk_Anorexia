	<TEXT> A guy goes up to the bar and has a drink. A few moments later another guy comes up and says to the bartender "hey jackass, get me a beer!" The bartender gladly hands the man a beer and continues working. 

After a while the same guy approaches the bar and says again "hey jackass, get me another beer!" The bartender again gladly serves the man.

Confused the guy asks the bartender "why do you let him call you that?" 

The bartender replies "HE-HAW HE-HAWlways calls me that!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yesterday. I went for a run and about halfway my butt hairs started to get knotted up in one another. Then I had the sensation to poo and hurried back home. When I sat down I could feel my hair's being pulled because the hairs tangled up with the ones on the other side. When I pushed, my poop hit those trip wire hairs and pulled them out. Made me actually cry a few tears. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Golf. The alone time and stress relief I get from just going to the driving range to better my shot. You learn to be patient and some courses have beautiful views. Also you can have some drinks while playing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They didn't kill golf. Once they grow old and start to realize how annoying the world is they can try golf. I wasn't a fan when I was younger but just got fully into it this year. Some courses are absolutely stunning and it's relaxing to take your time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work third shift and when I come in early I help second shift clean up at the end of their shift. I'll sweep stuff into a pile 5-10 feet away from the trash. Then when one of them brings a shovel to pick it up I'll sweep so they have to stand under a conveyor and bent over while I take my time only to have them move again. </TEXT>
