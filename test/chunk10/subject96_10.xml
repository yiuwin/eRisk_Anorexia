Since when do Democrats care about the cost? There's no cost too high to keep America safe.

All human beings are just "human shaped bunches of cells". Literally every one. The cells themselves are alive.

If consciousness was what really mattered, it would be fine to kill people who are asleep or otherwise unconscious.

Not only did the economy boom and make Chile one of the most developed nations in South America, but the free markets eventually led to the country being democratic.

Compare that to Venezuela, which is running out of basic food and water, and yes - I would *absolutely* take Pinochet over even the best communist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difference is, I suppose, the *people*. Arizona's had tons of important politicians, like Barry Goldwater, John McCain, and Carl Hayden. So did Texas. When it comes to Florida, though, not as many come to mind - Claude Pepper, George Smathers, Lawton Chiles, sure. But none of them had the charisma to become a presidential nominee, nor anything setting them really apart, other than the relentlessly liberal Claude Pepper. (I mean, 99% of people don't even know those names.) Florida was just an unimportant backwater until the 70s and 80s, with very few notable politicians, whereas Arizona and Texas had numerous important politicos.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Florida's population only really boomed in the past few decades, and it was a strongly conservative state until the 90s, so it wasn't important politically until quite recently. I'm sure more Floridians will run for President in the future, though; there were 2 this year alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I defined "major-party" as a candidate who won at least one state *or* won more than 15% of the national popular vote.

Additionally, I only counted unique instances of each candidate. For instance, FDR was a presidential nominee 4 times, but I only counted him once. (New York would be even more dominant otherwise.)

Feel free to ask any questions here. However, I think the data clearly supports the fact that New York is the greatest state. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As an upstate New Yorker, yes. Trump actually won upstate after Dems won it for decades, just like Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and ME-2. But because we have the massive anchor of NYC hanging around our necks, our part in the revolution will never be known :(
