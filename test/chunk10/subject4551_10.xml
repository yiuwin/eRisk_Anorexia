I *think* the major difference between the treatment of Nazism   Japanese imperialism is that Nazism *still* has some adherents   influence in the west. You won't find many advocating for Japanese domination of the East in the way you'll find white supremacy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Slightly strange article, in that it, in essence, it merely backs up what Orwell himself says about Homage, which that it is a partial account of what Orwell himself saw. 

The last paragraph containing this "Instructions left before his death for a later edition ignored his acceptance of the need for a unified war effort in Spain. It is as if the Orwell of Animal Farm, Nineteen Eighty-Four and the lister of suspect fellow-travellers for the Foreign Office thought that he should let it stand as another nail in the communist coffin, despite its distortion of the Spanish situation." doesn't actually seem to make sense either - why is it Orwell's fault that his notes were ignored?  </TEXT>

I could be corrected, but I'm pretty sure the Sharks ran out of steam (understandably, given it was early preseason for them) which allowed Sarries to beat them. 

As for how they'd do against the NZ teams? God knows.  </TEXT>

The AW is a useful tournament as a half way house between the reserves and the first XV. That said, it's organised in a daft way and as you say, there's not a huge amount of interest - although that said, gates at Sarries for the two group games were OK. The sales for the semi final are laughable though, even at 15 a pop.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm struggling to put into words about this.

Absolutely gutted. When I first started semi-regularly visiting Vicarage Road in the early 90s, it was a shell of a football club. Floating around in the lower reaches of the (now) championship, falling to bits, neglected.

His return saw a huge jump in gates, and belief returning. He didn't save us from relegation, immediately, but he worked in the background. 

Got Elton back involved. Put on his tracksuit, and got Watford - little old Watford! - back in the Premier League. A day at Wembley, with a team of cheap buys. Beating Liverpool. Taking Utd to the wire at Vicarage Road. A team we could all believe in. 

Before his arrival in the late 70s, we'd spent two years in the top two tiers. Since then, we've only spent two years outside them.

He transformed the club. Gave the town a team to be proud of. 

He's one of my all time heroes.

Vale, GT.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *cough* Zebre *cough*

It's not that I saw a good match, it looked to me that the Super teams were overpowering Sarries, even though they were just starting their preseason and Sarries were midseason and should have had an edge in match fitness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whenever I've seen South African Super teams play at Allianz Park, it's always struck me that they seem *literally* stronger than Sarries.  They've always been ringrusty, but look really classy. 

So, based on that, Superthe rest. 

I think this seasons Champions Cup is showing that there's a fag paper between the rest of the leagues in Europe. The French might have the budgets, but the Irish have some really good players, well coached that play with the passion that comes from having a level of attachment to your team that some of the French teams lack, certainly away from home. AP teams kind of fall somewhere in the middle, I think. 

That said, the worst team(s) in the Pro 12 seem to be much worse than the worst AP teams.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've not seen the Crown, but it's hard to see him as a particularly sympathetic character; it's worth bearing in mind he was sympathetic to the Nazis,   was apparently lined up to become monarch once more if Hitler had invaded (although I'm not 100% on the accuracy of this) 

His softness on Nazism also means that you can certainly have fun with a counter history where he didn't abdicate, and his influence led to Britain either staying out of the war entirely, or seeing Halifax rather than Churchill taking the Prime Ministership in 1940, leaving Europe to the Germans.  

But that's probably a story for another thread </TEXT>

Frankly, they need to get over it. So far, there is absolutely no evidence that they cause extra injuries, although I'm led to believe it causes *different* injuries. If it was such a problem, surely you'd see Sarries (given I'm pretty sure we got there first) having loads of players knackered in home games. That's just not happening. 

Having played at Allianz Park, burns aren't really a huge issue either.   </TEXT>
