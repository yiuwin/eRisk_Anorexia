	<TEXT> How did they solve all of the logistical problems involved in the journey to America. How did they plan out how much food to take without knowing how far they had to sail? They thought they were going to East Asia the first time IIRC. Did Astronomy help them estimate the distant they would have to travel? Not sure if this is the right place to ask so apologies in advance.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the time it's when you have a clear advantage (you have more items/Higher Level than enemy, enemy has no summoner spells, enemy is out of position, etc); but like you said it is match up dependent. It probably won't be a good idea to aggro if you know your early game is weaker than theirs, but obviously you can always just be better than your enemies or outplay them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me psychedelics (DMT, LSD and Weed) kinda just made me view the world in a different way, obviously from the visuals for course but also my worldview. It made me a spiritual person, in the sense that I want to better myself as a person not religious. 

What I believe is that these compounds make us feel like we are connecting with something greater/being enlightened WHILE we are under the influence of these drugs, but once we come down most of that goes away. What I think the "goal" or purpose of these experiences is, is to give you a taste of enlightenment/connecting to something greater so that you can eventually reach this state naturally through self development (meditation, yoga, learning from others and books, etc). The only difference being that the drug induced insight/enlightenment is temporary while insight produced naturally is always with you. Those are just my thoughts.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me usually the only part of it that is a chore for me is actually starting the session. Once i'm 5-10 mins into the session it starts becoming enjoyable as my mind starts to settle down. I usually sit for about 15-20 mins. Also 30 mins is crazy long for a beginner haha, i would try reducing that to 20 mins at least. Peace brother and good luck with your practice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is actually very easy to do and most people over-complicate it. There are many ways to meditate but the simplest to understand is whats called Vipassana or Insight meditation. Links at the bottom 

Basically all you do is: 

1) Sit/lay down (although laying down promotes sleeping so sit if you don't want to fall asleep during it) in a comfortable way 

2) Take around 5 or so deep and slow breaths to promote relaxation.

3) Focus your attention on the sensations of your breathing (air going through the nose, chest rising and falling, etc). This is what is called an Anchor. You can have anything as a Anchor (A Candle, voice/singing/chanting, etc) but the breath is the best imo because it is always with you and the easiest to comeback to, but do what you like to do.

4) While you are trying to focus on your breathing thoughts will start to show up in your mind, things like: "what am I going to eat afterwards?", "this is boring", "am i even doing this right??",  past pictures/memories, etc. You might notice right away that you are caught up in a thought or you might not notice for a couple of minutes. Just simply acknowledge (DON"T HATE YOURSELF FOR LOSING FOCUS IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE) that you lost your focus and return to the breath. Repeat. It's that simple. 

Try to look at your thoughts/sensations from a 3rd party perspective in your mind, you will realize that you can choose to just watch that thoughts come and go or attach to a thought and let it take you away from the breath (or whatever your anchor is)

After sitting for about 15ish mins and onwards (at least for me) your thoughts start to come about with less frequency and you start to enter this "void" of no thoughts briefly (about 10 sec for me when i first started before getting lost in thought again) which is the essence of meditation. This "thought void" in the mind is a very relaxing and peaceful experience that is hard to explain in words but once you experience for the first time you will know exactly what everyone is talking about. 

When first starting out, for me 10 minutes of this every day was doable. I recommend doing it in the morning so you can get it out of the way and to start your day off in a good calm mind state. After a week or so increase the time by 5 minutes and then another. Most people I know meditate for 20-30ish mins once or twice a day or more. Whatever works for you.

Once you get decent at this you will soon realize that you can do this anytime and anywhere in waking life to return to this peaceful state of no thought.
