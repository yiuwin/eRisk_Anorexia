	<TEXT> The very first time I was tempted to analyse these lyrics was when I read about the birth defects linked to Thalidomide  use in medical school.How interesting the history classes were ,had they been taught in the form of songs like this ! Billy Joel has covered every salient point in history from 1940s to 1970s from Profumo scandal to the Rock and Roller Coca Cola wars in this 4:49 minutes long song . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To my eyes ,rather than perturbed by this beautiful gal,Anna seems to be lost in her thoughts .It seems some thing is bugging her ( could be anything ).Moreover ,being acquainted to the tinsel town ,she's no stranger to the presence of beautiful ladies around her husband ,this incident should not worry her at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A young banker decided to get his first tailor made suit. So he went to the finest tailor in town and got measured for a suit. A week later he went in for his first fitting. He put on the suit and he looked stunning, he felt that in this suit he can do business.
As he was preening himself in front of the mirror he reached down to put his hands in the pockets and to his surprise he noticed that there were no pockets. He mentioned this to the tailor who asked him, "Didn't you tell me you were a banker?"

The young man answered, "Yes, I did."

To this the tailor said, "Who ever heard of a banker with his hands in his own pockets?"

	<TEXT> This is the prescient streak in you ( which I found on your palm ) ,a sharp intuition ,and a sense of things to come though it's always vague .Your long fingers indicate an artistic bent of mind and a very refined taste .I'd love to listen to the musical pieces that you've created ( and as by nature ,you like privacy and solitude ,you'll never like the public glare ) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the detailed reply ,certainly helpful for me ,especially in the development of my skills (  it's a  favourite hobby of mine :D).Double star indicates great fame on your hand ,it's a sign of luck ( I don't know what is your profession but whatever it is ,there is great fame associated with it ).Your intelligence is exceptional and coupled with a strong luck line makes you an extremely lucky person.
Dual personality ,sometime means dual persona as well,one for public ,one for real ( but in your case ,you have balanced it out ) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are possess an extremely  intelligent analytical and logical mind ,and a natural attitude towards  finance and law.Your mind has two different dimensions ( by this reading ,you should also have dual personalities ,but you have a good control over your mind and they are merged into one ) one dimension is creative,other is practical .Though your practical dimension has overtaken the creative one ,there is still some struggle underneath .Oh,and you've got an excellent memory .
You take your time while making decisions and you are quite secretive .You like control in life and you are an enigma for most of the people .You are also prescient and blessed with a well developed sixth sense .You are also prone to bouts of depression and mood swings .
In your early childhood ,either you got very ill or there was a big emotional trauma ( as it has left its mark )
You have travelled a lot and it has brought you lots of success (in future you'll travel more ).
In the matter of heart ,there have been some disappointments ,but I see one  strong  relationship ( where there is some kind of conflict )
You are greatly influenced by one of your family members ,though you have faced lots of opposition in your life .
You are in a leadership position of some sort ,you've got enormous confidence and an independent view of the world.
You also like to think and reflect in solitude 
And you are a very lucky man . </TEXT>

A few days later, the doctor saw Morris walking down the street with a gorgeous young woman on his arm.

A couple of days later, the doctor spoke to Morris and said: "You're really doing great, aren't you?"

Morris replied: "Just doing what you said, Doc. Get a hot mamma and be cheerful."

The doctor said: "I didn't say that. I said, You've got a heart murmur - be careful." </TEXT>
