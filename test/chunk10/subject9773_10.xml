	<TEXT> This is an old account of mine I'm using since I don't want my mains location to be needlessly proliferated. 

If you know if there is anyone in Denton Tx, or are part of a group of people preparing to protest Rooshypoos at the Denton Square please notify me. Something needs to be done but everyone I've talked to weren't interested in anything. 

I'll engage with you on my main account via PM to finalize coordination so you that know that I'm not a Rooshy informant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I checked myself into the hospital about 3 months ago for a stay that lasted a week. Going in I was terrified and didn't want to do it and was about to turn around. It was the BEST thing I could have done for myself. 

It was scary and I really didn't like it going into it, but once I adjusted I had a great time in the hospital and learned a lot. **Recommended 100%** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree! I think Neoliberalism is the culprit of the mass meat consumption/production.. at least in North America. With the incredible amount of government subsidies for factory farming meat, and the social/consumer status of meat consumption I think that there is definitely a systematic slant (or more like aggressive push) towards meat-based diets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sleeping and eating well are the best things you could do for yourself. When I was checked into a hospital for a week the two biggest priorities for the doctors wasn't anything like productive therapy sessions, but that I slept all night and had a (healthy) appetite. It seems like common sense, but it is a BIG deal. 
(it might be noted that I checked in for Bipolar 2/depression/anxiety.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes please. I'd really love to have exposure to zines. Especially Queer Anarchy and Radical veganism. This is entirely off-topic but is there some type of resource that I can have access to these type publications? I feel rather community-less and looking for some sort of connection to other radical queers/leftists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty depressed and apathetic to life in general. I'm not necessarily suicidal, but I've been somewhat more aggressively starving myself to cope with everything. They apparently see things that I'm not capable of, which just scares me more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for everyone that has responded. I don't feel like I need to be in inpatient care but everyone that is close to me says that I'm not healthy beyond general depression. That indicates to me that I'm probably just too unhealthy to really grasp where I am, I guess.. ? I dunno, but the people that love me tell me that I need it, so I'm going to rely on them. I'm going to end up checking my self in and going to try to stabilize out. 

Once again, thanks, I'm still really scared of the hospital but everyone says that it will only be a really good thing for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friends and family are pushing for me to be hospitalized. It fucking terrifies me and I don't know what to do. 
I'm not suicidal so do I really need to be institutionalized? I know it could help, but it is it really necessary? 

What are your experienced with hospitalization? Please, I'm scared, any information helps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have got to read Kate Bornstein. She is absolutely awesome.

http://www.amazon.com/Queer-Pleasant-Danger-Memoir/dp/0807001651
A Queer and Pleasant Danger is a really REALLY awesome and hilarious memoir of her life and her journey from a jewish boy, scientologist, a woman, and now somewhere in between. It's a wonderful story. HIGHLY recommend 10/10 to anyone.

Auntie Kate is one of my heroes and one of the oldest/historically prominent veterans of non-binary gender movements (or Gender Anarchy as she calls it 3).

Edit: She also has two version of her "Gender Workbook". Also, HIGHLY recommended.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> INFP who is currently talking to an INTJ here. I'm going to assume your girlfriend's personality is similar to mine. She sounds like she is probably xNFP.

I see how super important completing goals are to my INTJ, and when they fail to do something they get incredibly disappointed with themselves to a fairly extreme degree. So when I realize that I am no where near working towards a career, or even a real path for a career, I project that same level of disappointment on myself (and by extension I *feel* that they are equally upset with me). So it is REALLY important to reassure your girlfriend that it's okay that a career isn't a driving force in her life, and it in no way measures her value as a person, or your level of affection towards her.

I think on a level that your girlfriend needs to work on is realizing that a career potentially might not be a huge part of her life. It's perfectly okay to derive fulfillment in other ways. Not everyone is cut out to be a fast tracked, goal oriented, career-superman like you INTJ's... I mean damn, I certainly can't keep up. Your girlfriend just needs to find a niche that makes her happy and above all fulfilled. Lots of us INFP's don't have super illustrious or even remotely consistent careers; just doing what is most fulfilling, and trying to find the best way to *feel* life. To be honest, a single tracked career sounds terrifying to me.. no way I want to work my way through the SAME job path my entire life, no matter how successful I can get.

tl;dr: 1.) Make sure your girlfriend knows you aren't upset with her, and she is still a valuable person that you love regardless of a career. 2.) Your girlfriend should find her own path to fulfillment and happiness rather than compare herself to the superman-career-driven INFJ that you are. Both of you are valuable and successful, just in different ways because you are different types of people.

Hope at least some of this is helpful. :)  </TEXT>
