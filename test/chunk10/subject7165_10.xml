	<TEXT> I'm writing a research paper using a Japanese sponsored newspaper published in the Philippines. [This is the headlines from January 10, 1943] (http://imgur.com/Dfd2pnd). I can't seem to find anything on google search about this event. I plan to go to the library tomorrow, but some background on this would be nice so I'll know what to look for.

Just a guess, Nanking was a puppet State at the time. The Japanese wanted Jose Laurel (puppet president of the Philippines) to declare war on the US and Britain, same thing probably happened in Nanking.

	<TEXT> Bonifacio was still privileged and grew up under conditions that were not present in most people. It is true that information is more accessible now. I pirate most of my books from my internet. If you reread my arguments in the previous point, the problem is not the lack of access but rather the lack of interest or desire. Why is there a lack of interest or desire? Because it is repressed by something in power - in this case, the Church. The means to becoming smart are out there but the Church produces people (us) that will not take an interest in those things. The culture also represses those who decide to become deviant.

Also, it has nothing to do with socialist ideals, that's another topic. I'm focusing here about the nature of power and knowledge production. A fancier way to phrase what I said would be: The Church possesses large amounts of symbolic capital (third face of power) and it uses this to produce indifferent followers and creates a status quo that represses the creation of organic intellectuals.

Try reading Foucault and Gramsci. Its going to help you understand this subject better :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> didn't notice the autocorrect :)
I didn't know you can leave your contact number with them. Is this a legit thing, or are you just friends with the people in Phil Post? The last time I was there, they were very rude to me. The cashier ignored me for 15minutes while I was tapping on the glass. A bunch of office people came who were her friends and she immediately attended to them. I was blocking the hole in the glass so the documents were passed overhead. Then she made them come in the office. I waited another 20 minutes for them to finish. I already complained multiple times about how my stuff never arrives. They never asked for my number or anything, they just told me to wait then ignored everything I said.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to take precaution when relying on your own interpretation of philosophical works. Hitler used Nietzsche and misinterpreted his ubermensch and will to power concept. Hitler claimed that Nietzsche agrees to what he is doing, but the truth is that Nietzsche despised Hitler and hated his sister marrying a Nazi officer and later running away to Argentina with him. </TEXT>
