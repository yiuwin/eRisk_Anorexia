	<TEXT> Hello again!

I've concluded that the AWB Onesky (Heritage 130P in Canada) will be best the route for our immediate purposes! 

After a few video reviews I was sold on the idea of owning one in the short term and then investing in an 8 or 10" Dob in the future!

Thanks for your generous help!

Are there any highly recommended accessories I should look at getting that would compliment the Heritage 130P? A moon filter seems in order as I'm sure the girls will want to point to the moon right away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After a long night of research I've concluded that the z8 will be the 2nd telescope I purchase for myself later on.

In the short term though I'd like something much more portable and easy to use while camping or on day trips with the kids. So size and portability is key.

Among the scopes I'm now considering:

Z130  
Starblaster 6 or 6i  
127SLT  
130SLT  
Celestron c90 or c5 (seems ultra portable)

From what I've gathered they all their pros and cons so it's a tough decision. Are you able to provide any further insight on these models? Are there any other reliable telescopes that fit in this category?

Can definitely do without GOTO

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your response. As much as I'd love to get the z8 I don't think it would fit our lifestyle very well. We have mid sized hatchback which I'm sure it could fit in but then there's no room for the rest of our gear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks again for the insightful information. I'm going to abandon the GoTo idea and stick with the old fashion way.

My daughters are 11 and 10, the 11 year old is the one who obsesses over astronomy. The telescope is more for myself and her.

That z8 seems like an incredible deal but I was surprised to see how large it is. It's doubtful we could pack it along with our camping gear!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow you're awesome. Thanks for the detailed and prompt reply. 

To start off, I'm not fully against refractor, I just assumed it would be more difficult to pack and transport during our trips. If I'm wrong though then I'm open to more suggestions! 

I'm also a goofball and didn't think to covert the mm to inches. In my mind 102 was on the higher scale. That's my oversight.

The GOTO isn't a must. One of my girls is obsessed with astronomy so it shouldn't be too difficult to get her into manually doing things. I just thought they'd appreciate the feature. I'm also quite a bit of a tech head too so I was drawn to it.

I guess all things being equal, where should I look in order to get the best bang for my buck? Ease of use, transport and setup are also features I'd like to consider but not 100 necessary.

Edit: including refractors  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello fellow stargazers,

I'm currently on the hunt for a telescope that my whole my family (myself wife and 2 daughters) will enjoy using.

I have in mind something with a GOTO option as the kids would most likely enjoy this feature. As such I've been looking into this cassgrain telescope https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1248232-REG/celestron_22202_astro_fi_102mm_f_13.html simply because I'd probably have an easier time convincing the kids to pull up the app on their phones in order to take control.

All that being said I'm open to any suggestions that will fit our budget. If there's certain features or other aspects that are worth an extra little bit I could stretch the budget further.

Some things to keep in mind. I'd much prefer a reflector or catadioptric telescope. We live in a suburban area but frequently go out to rural areas for camping or day trips.

Any help, recommendations or feedback on the above linked telescope would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As the title says. My friend's G4 ran into the same issue as most of you have. He tried dealing with LG and our Canadian carrier but he was blocked every time. The Carrier wanted $250 to attempt to fix it. 

I didn't know much about the issue at first. I thought it was just software, but seeing as I couldn't even get to the bootloader I had to check around for solutions. 

I came across this post on XDA from a few days ago http://forum.xda-developers.com/g4/general/lg-g4-bootloop-fix-t3488449

I did exactly what OP said on my first attempt but it didn't work. I tried again but revised it a bit by applying heat for a little longer and adding small pressure as the CPU heated up. Put it all back together and we were greeted with Android's setup screen! 

Hope this helps someone on here! I'll answer any questions if someone wants to give it a shot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not defending RG. I think it's an awful card. But taking time off the game basically puts you behind even more. Next time you come all cards you face feel like they'll be overlevelled </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since reaching 4200 with an xbow deck I stopped worrying about my crown chest. I just play to keep my slots full, the grind for the crown chest while using an xbow deck was too time consuming. At the end of it, I'm still averaging 1 crown chest per 24 to 36 hours so it's really not that bad.

PS: fuck level 12 and 13 RGs </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Xbow, inferno tower, fireball, mega minion, skarmy, log, spirits and ice golem. The struggle vs RG is real, but I've consistently remarked between 4000 - 4100. RG is 50/50 win loss. Definitely the most aggravating to play against.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excellent write up by a quality content creator! 

Rocket siege is definitely more viable in challenges or tournaments. It's difficult to finish a match within 4 minutes on ladder with rocket siege. Players are more apt to push for draws on ladder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I installed a new light fixture in our bedroom and want to add a dimmer switch to control it. I pulled off the old light fixture and was greeted with the pictures in the image post. 

The old light switch has a red wire and 1 black wire coming up from the same hole to the screws. The other black wire is coming up a separate line and going into the push-in connector. There's two white wires chilling in the back connected to each other not doing anything.

New dimmer switch has 2 black wires and a blue wire for the ground.

I can't figure out which of the 3 wires in the first image I'm supposed to use for the wires on the new dimmer. My assumption is the red one for the hot (red) wire and the black one in the screw for the other. What do i do with the wire in the push-in connector and what about the grounding wire?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: my knowledge of this stuff extends to installing basic light fixtures </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I roll with fireball and log. I can typically fend off attacks and out chip them. When they see me fireballing the RG usually comes out. 

Don't get me wrong, RG is a tough battle. But it's not impossible. </TEXT>
