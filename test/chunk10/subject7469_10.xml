	<TEXT> Hey all,

I just picked up Daniel Smith's "50 Strategies that changes History"
and really want to talk with others that love history books or just talking history in general.

I have had my eye on this book for a while and grabbed it for my birthday. I love how this book comes across in presentation.  


So yeah, how many of you would drop by if I was to start streaming book discussions/ History talking on the regular ? 

Edit: I'm going live at 12:30 AEST Link here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crn1gY3qf5g </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all, 

I have been a love of various hot sauces over the last few years and want to have a go at making some at home. Can you point me to a pretty simple recipe or just in general tell me how your first batch went when you made some.

I live in Australia and may not have access to some of the crazier peppers that north america has.

I still remember when I got my first small bottle of tobasco sauce, what a glorious day.
Anyway thanks in advance reddit hot sauce peoples. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have never been one to hang out just to make sure I catch episodes of a show as they are released, but with Billions I have no choice. This show is pure amazing genius. I love it so much, I think about it when not watching it.

For me, this show is better than Game of Thrones. Yeah, I said it. </TEXT>
