	<TEXT> I agree with Fantano that one of the really fucked up thing about it all is that there were people who knew what was going on, but didn't do anything about it... because how can a scene preach all of these messages yet still allow one of its figurehead to continue doing it? 

Like the people who were in the know have some explaining to do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess the problem for so many people is that they felt that PWR BTTM was supposed to be against all of those things. It is easy to separate the art and the artist in theory, but if what the art stands for contradicts the action of the artist then that becomes more difficult. 

Like the band was supposed to be this progressive band that LGBTQ youth could rally behind, and feel safe and comfortable at their shows, so when it turned out the band was none of that, either by being an abuser or being accepting of it, then that feels like a big middle finger to the people who supported them. Like I am sure if member of a black metal band came out as gay, vegan, and pro-immigration that their core fanbase would have reacted with disgust as well... and just to be clear, I think none of those things are bad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also talking to someone who is not in your life is often easier, because feeling suicidal feels embarrassing (or it at least did for me), to admit that you're thinking of killing yourself is really hard to do, so getting to talk to someone who you don't know might be very helpful... because you don't have to deal with their judgement the same way you might have to do with people in your personal life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah when I was at my most depressed it became all consuming, there was days where I could barely think of anything besides killing myself, and I didn't want to tell my parents or friends because I was afraid that people would just tell me to deal with it or stop feeling sorry for myself.  

Of course suicide is terrible, but I'd suggest anyone who think of it as selfish to either talk with someone who has been suicidal, or read literature by someone like David Foster Wallace. Because depression is ugly, it is feels embarrassing, often it feels unbearable, but it is never easy.  </TEXT>

Because this was at least a normal commercial, and not this big budget production that they must have spent a bad amount of money on.

Still really stupid though, you'd think that if anything they would have learnt from the Pepsi controversy that the dumbest way to sell us garbage food and drink is through half-assed attempts at sincerity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again the idea of using fallacious reasoning to call out other people's fallacies is self-contradictory, and that is what you implied when you said that calling out other people's fallacy is valid... which it isn't, there is zero merit to that way of thinking, as it rarely explains why the things they are arguing about is right or wrong. 

And my point is that saying that I am wrong doesn't mean that you are wrong, we're not specifically talking about this situation, we are talking about the general ideas of pointing out fallacies. In which you are absoutely not correct by simply saying that someone else did something wrong.  </TEXT>

I get that it fits into your beliefs, and that is fine, but that doesn't mean that I shouldn't be hesitant of unsourced opinion pieces from youtubers.... also it is clearly a rant, I am not saying all rants are bad, but they are inherently biased, and I think even the guy in the video would admit to that.

	<TEXT> Yeah I don't mind people eating meat, because that is your right, but it do pisses me off when people are selectively angry at animal cruelty as long as it doesn't affect them in any way. So of course people in the west will laugh at the idea that it is equally as wrong to eat pigs as it is to eat dogs, but that is not because eating dog is objectively worse, it just that most people don't want to give up the food they already enjoy... and nobody here eats dog, so of course it is easy for us to condemn it, because we don't have to deal with any consequences personally. 

Is the same thing when people who would never wear fur anyway takes a huge stand against it, but won't even entertain the idea of having a meatless day a week.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I agree with Phil that just because you're offended doesn't mean you're right, I think it is important to keep in mind that the opposite isn't true either. Just because you're not offended by something doesn't mean that you're right or that other people's opinions and emotions are less valid than your own. 

So it shouldn't ever come down "stop being so sensitive" or whatever, if someone is wrong we should be able to argue against it with something a bit more robust.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I think a good measure for decent amount of objectivity is being able to categorise a band you hate in a genre you love... and for bands like Deafheaven it was clear that the animosity people had for them wasn't simply because their sound, but also because of their image, and presentation, and probably because of their label at the time. Now that doesn't mean that they are more authentic black metal because of that, but I don't think the rejection it saw from some groups of people was simply because of the sound itself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean like I already know they're not an actual black metal band, but we've already been over this. And I understand it, I just don't buy it, because I don't think you guys care about categorisation, I think you guys are looking for two things: 1) reasons to mock, belittle, and make fun of other people, and 2) reasons to validate your opinion as more valuable than others. 

I know there is a difference between actual black metal and various sub/fusion genres, but I think it just dishonest to claim that people don't categorise based on taste, because there is zero evidence to suggest that... most people do let their taste influence the way categorise something.

Like just honest here, if we took two bands that are heavily influenced by black metal, but also incorporates different genres, and you really like one of them and hate the other, wouldn't you be more likely to distance the band you dislike from black metal?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They're Post Black Metal. Drop all that other garbage. Yes we know what their influences are, yes we know what other styles they embody, you don't have to cram it all into some made up genre title.
 

Which is kinda my point though, because I didn't say that is actually their genre, just that it is more convenient to call them black metal or blackgaze or whatever. 

And here is the thing, I don't hang on metal subreddits, if I regularly frequented /r/metal or /r/blackmetal I wouldn't call them blackmetal on those subs, but I don't so I am not worried about any of it. 

Although isn't calling them post black metal the same as calling them "not real" black metal? Because the implications is that is either a subgenre, a fusion genre, or derivative of it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that is actually what they are though, so you could throw a fit all you want, but you're just wrong if you can't hear a clear black metal influence in their music... because you can be influenced by music even if you don't play it.

And it actually is about taste since you people do correlate taste with knowledge... and you can throw your little fits if it makes you feel better about yourself, but I'll still call Deafheaven black metal, it is just easier that way. 

And you know, everyone has to deal with their favourite genres being misrepresented, so nothing to be whiny about... I don't make a big deal out of people calling metalcore for screamo, they're wrong, but so what? So you can laugh at me if that is what you need to deal with whatever is going on your life, but I'll probably laugh back at you for being butthurt over Babymetal and Deafheaven. okay?

No bad feelings though, but I am not gonna change just because you tell me I am wrong, I know I am, I just don't care.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Black metal influenced post-metal with shoegaze and screamo elements then? 

And I am not invested enough in black metal to really care all that much, so I don't have much issue calling Wolves in The Throne Room, Krallice, Deafheaven, early Alcest, etc. black metal. Obviously I am not going to go as far as to call Young and in the Way black metal, but I am not too worried about it.

Now you might say that is ignorant, and I can't blame you, but regardless my point is that I enjoy these black metal influenced band that aren't black metal more than actual black metal, even though I have given some of those a try, and I even enjoy some of them... like Weakling or Dark Space. 

But yeah I know I am not an authority by a long shot, but I don't care either way, because I'll enjoy what I'll enjoy, and I don't really feel the need to make fun of people who say wrong/stupid things about the music I enjoy, because it doesn't matter.  </TEXT>

Also, who gets to decide who is knowledgable enough anyway? Like I know that personally don't know enough about metal to act as an authority on it, but who does? 

And I am just curious, if I said Deafheaven was my favourite black metal band would I be false based on that alone?  </TEXT>
