	<TEXT> I am kinda new to the sneaker cleaning bussines, I have a local bussines in my city and have been invitet by a well known shop here to clean shoes at an event. The cleaning process I use is working really well for orders that i take home but the drying process is natural drying at my window and takes about an hour. At this event i am required to clean shoes while people are wearing them, that is not a problem for the cleaning process, but I have to find a faster way to dry them while they are wearing them. Any suggestions? </TEXT>
