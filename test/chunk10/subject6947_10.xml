	<TEXT> It was highly-rated and well-performing overall, but it was also produced by an outside company, i.e. not ABC (20th Century Fox, IIRC).

If you look, a lot of the end-of-season cancellations were of "outside" shows. Dr. Ken, another well-performing ABC show, was cancelled...and was produced by WB (again, IIRC). Because ABC doesn't own them, they see no syndication revenue.

This is true for CBS, Fox and NBC, as well. It's more notable because, at those networks, they were lower performers (like CBS' Two Broke Girls, which was a below-average performer in its now-final season)

Additionally, it comes down to scheduling space. Because, as the head of ABC said at Upfronts (where they announce scheduled and sell shows to advertisers), they decided to do away with the Friday night comedies, and replaced them with ABC-owned Once Upon a Time and Agents of SHIELD. </TEXT>

Five-0 is great. Ups and downs, yes, but no "peak". Same for Madam Sec. Both are CBS shows.  CBS does drama really well, very hit-and-miss on comedies.

Like I said, because they had to wait it out until March for CA:TWS to release, the first 18 eps were kind of necessitated to be expositional. But once TWS happened? Shit. Got. Amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: Rebels both improved as the show went on. This past season, season three, of Rebels was phenomenal beyond description.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine is still as hilarious as ever.

Hawaii Five-0 and Madam Secretary are still going strong.

Agents of SHIELD, too, gets better as time goes on. First season, pre-Winter Soldier, was a little slow, but still good. After the Winter Soldier tie-in, SHIELD took off, hard and fast. This past season, especially since January, has been fucking great. Seriously great television.

The Blacklist is as awesome as ever.

The Middle, The Last Man on Earth, and The Goldbergs are still excellent.

	<TEXT> Sabine Wren is voiced by an actress of Indian ancestry, Tiya Sircar.

While it would have been easy enough for them to cast white folks or whatever as her mom and brother, instead, they cast [two performers of Indian ancestry](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Zero_Hour#Cast) as her mom and brother, Sharmila Devar (Lauren Wellman on ABC's *Scandal*) and Ritesh Rajan (Linus Ahluwalia on Freeform's *Stitchers*).

Like I said, since it's voice actors, it would have been easy enough to "get away with" casting performers of not of Indian ancestry, but, instead, they maintained a sort of meta-continuity with casting performers of Indian ancestry as her family members.

Just something I noticed. </TEXT>

If he was Thrawn or Plagueis (operating under the "we use the same map" principle) or Jar-Jar or or or or, they wouldn't be debating, up until two months before release, what he looks like, nor would the director and the creature effects supervisor be debating whether or not the big baddie should be a she or a he.

	<TEXT> Long post ahead:

If you find a production company who wants to make it, and you either shoot a pilot to shop around to different networks, or a network orders a pilot, then the network execs watch the pilot to see if it's sellable (unfortunately, it all boils down to ad revenue, especially on network (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CW); slightly less so on cable; no idea about premium).

If they think it's sellable, they might give "notes", like on suggested tweaks for a second pilot or something. Else, they'll put in an order for 13 episodes (usually 13, sometimes 16). Then those 13 will be scheduled somewhere; if you're lucky, it'll be either September or January, the start of the season, or right after the mid-season break. If you're not, it'll be in the off-season, like May or, if they really want to kill your show, over the summer. 

If you are a big name (Spielberg, Whedon, Katims...), and they love the hell out of your show, they might give it a straight-to-series order, meaning you have 22 episodes from Day 1.

Then again, Spielberg exec produced Fox's *Terra Nova* a few years ago, and that was one-and-done, since it wasn't profitable. (I'm still cheesed about that unresolved finale cliffhanger.)

If those 13 perform profitably (sometimes, after the first 4-6 episodes if your show is a smash hit), they'll order a "back nine" (or a back five, which is increasingly common) for a full 22 episode season.

If the show performed profitably across the whole of the season, hello second year of employment! If not, well, at least now you have an agent and you know some people.


If, and this is a giant if, your show is a smash hit beyond all expectation, like NBC's *This is Us* (which I highly recommend), you'll get a two-season pickup (or like the two season renewal *The Big Bang Theory* just scored, meaning it'll run for at least 12 years. It also helps it's one of, if not ***the***, highest-rated TV shows currently airing). But even *This is Us* is only 18 episode seasons.

Usually, though, it's a year-by-year process.

Now, if the execs at the studio/network like you, even if your show doesn't pan out, they may sign you to a "talent holding deal", which usually says that you'll develop number of shows for them, in return for a guaranteed paycheck. Now, it might take two or three attempts, but once something sticks, and it's successful, the average length of a show is five seasons.

What if no one wants the pilot?

Well, ask pretty much any writer in Hollywood about failed pilots they wrote on, or even multi-episode shows that [never made it to air](http://bit.ly/2oOl5i3). 

It's only been the last decade, really, that cable has become something other than reruns, and, even then, USA, AMC and TBS are the ones that get the big fanfare. TNT is up there, but not quite as prestigious as AMC or USA.

ABC, NBC, CBS have 3 hours/day x 6 days, so 18 hours of space.

Fox has 2 hours * 6 days, so 12 hours

CW has 2 hours * 5 days, so 10 hours.

Space on network is scarce, so only the most sellable shows make it to broadcast. And, often, networks "overbook" themselves, ordering more shows than time allows, which is why some longer-running shows get bumped for a newer show, like *Gotham* and *24: Legacy*, so Gotham's season finale isn't airing until June. (This is a little bit of a skewed example; usually, the finale of the older show still airs during May sweeps.)

Look at [this year's schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_United_States_network_television_schedule#Schedule) to see what I mean about "overbooking". Or last year's. Or the year before's. Etc. Etc.

	<TEXT> That's a big no-no.

It's called "unsolicited material" and no one in the industry accepts it. With the exception of an agent, but if and when, they will ask *you* for it, so they can see some of your work and, even then, just to see if you're worth representing.

If all your scripts are blah and poorly formatted and you blatantly rip-off insert popular book series here, then odds are slim. Basically, agents act as your hypeman (or hypewoman) to studios/producers/etc.

Hollywood is one of the last industries that is, broadly, unaffected by the internet/YouTube and has probably some of the highest barriers to entry of any industry.

Want a loan of a few million to start an eco-friendly manufacturing plant? Here's the cash!
Want a loan of a few million to shoot an independent film? Yeah. The bank is gonna take your house because, unfortunately, besides the few (and I do mean few) success stories out of Cannes, Sundance, TIFF, etc., most independent films are lucky if they crack four figures in revenue. Keep in mind, too, that a lot of the film festival success stories have an A-lister, or, if not, at least a recognizable name, as a major role, if not as the lead.

Your "Alive in Joberg" leading to "District 9" stories are very, very irregular. Couple times a decade in a busy period.

It's also a very insular industry. Since no shows, studios, producers, etc. will read "unsolicited material", that is, anything not pitched by an agent, you could have the next multi-billion dollar franchise sitting on your hard drive, but because you don't have an agent (and, if you don't live in NYC-area or LA-area, it's reeeeally hard to find one), it'll never see the light of day.

And, like I said, with an agent, again, unless you are really lucky, they come to you.

And to be repped by Creative Artists Agency (CAA) or William Morris Endeavor (WME)? Start writing and directing high-profile multi-million dollar budget movies. If CAA or WME asks to rep you, that's a sign that you've become A-list. Seriously, Google their client lists. It's pretty much exclusively A-listers and other "big names".

That being said, if luck is with you, and you post a film you made to YouTube and it goes viral, and a "Hollywood someone" sees it, you have a chance.

	<TEXT> Like I said in my post, this could also be a way to re-introduce the long-removed Cardassian stories back into the game, as a PC "Typhon Pact Equivalent" Cardassian character (also with Breen, Tzenkethi) options,  la KDF and UFP.

Especially since the Romulan Empire is gone, they who turned the Dominion War in the favor of the allies, and the weakened navies of the UFP and KDF, it makes for a good time for a TPE to form. </TEXT>

Especially with the lack of Romulan Empire as a bulwark force, and the weakened navies of the UFP and KDF, it makes for a good time for a Typhon Pact equivalent.

And, maybe, this is how the Cardie stories are re-introduced? A PC Cardassian soldier who joins the TPE. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The biggest one, which is also kind of the most obvious, is the Fesarius Sector and its eponymous system.

Considering that we haven't heard from them since 2266/1966, besides a throwaway reference to tranya in an episode of DS9, they have only been touched on, at most, in a half dozen novels, with their really only being one novel that has them as the primary focus.

This leaves their entire story open for use, like with the Tzenkethi.

I think that, before the end of the year, we are going to see the First Federation be part of a major storyline.

What other piques of interest have you picked up on in the Alpha Quadrant expansion? </TEXT>

Too, the mission Anakin was on that brought Thrawn in to meet him, the details were very vague.

	<TEXT> What /u/backfromotterspace said, plus *Tarkin* (the novel) establishes that, while he has no definitive proof, Tarkin is pretty goddamn sure that Vader is one Anakin Skywalker, who he once served with in the Clone Wars. It kind of adds an additional dimension to the Tarkin-Vader dynamic, in that, even though he'd never dare actually ask, he knows-without-knowing who the man under the suit is, and knows that he's a capable battlefield commander and that their history affords Vader some leeway and respect.

Also, in the *Darth Vader* comics, he's actually "demoted" by Palpatine (now below recently promoted Grand General Tagge) for his failure at Yavin, so he reports to Tagge during the run of the comics, but he's also outside the formal chain of command; Vader kind of sits in a funky grey area, since he's the Emperor's muscle and mouth, basically, but he also has an element of General-ship when it comes to military matters. </TEXT>

Benzites, for example, have the respiratory device (well, some do.)

	<TEXT> I love the hell out of it.

For one, the card art is phenomenal.

Also, for being a hybrid of card game and MOBA, it's really well done.

And the gameplay can get stressful, but in a good way; that is, trying to make sure your base isn't getting swarmed while also trying to maintain an offensive against your enemy.

The gameplay is also very well done: it's a standard MOBA "attack the towers" game, but it's designed to only last a few minutes, which is more than enough most of the time.

The power regenerates at a reasonable rate, and bringing in big guns (like bombers) doesn't totally drain the bank, so you can also call in some ground troops as well.

And the leader abilities are very well-balanced, and the variety is fantastic.

Okay. That's my gush for now. Your turn. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Snoke theory: anagrams </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-23 06:55:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I ran the phrase "Supreme Leader Snoke" through an anagram solver word-by-word.

Each word had only one possible anagram each and, when put together, reveals a big secret:

Presume dealer Kenos.

This means that, when we are in Las Vegas, we need to assume that we need to gamble with the presumption that all of the dealers in the casino all play Keno.

For those who don't know, Keno is, basically, bingo, where you pick numbers and, based on how many numbers you pick, you get a different pay out (e.g. 1 number wins you 5,000:1 whereas 5 numbers win you 2:1. Not really, but just an example).

What does Keno have to do with anything? It's a number game.

You know what else heavily involved numbers? The TV show *Lost*, which was created and produced by JJ Abrams, who co-wrote and directed The Force Awakens.

On *Lost*, there was also a bald man with a mysterious past: John Locke. (Note, too, that "Snoke" and "Locke" are both 5 letters long and that they share 3 letters, two of which are in identical positions. This will be important in a moment.)

On the show, the real John Locke died and was replaced by the "Man In Black", the evil twin brother of the island's protector.

How did the Man in Black manifest himself when not in human form? Smoke. And "smoke" sounds a lot like "Snoke".

This all but confirms that Snoke is, in fact, the Man In Black/Smoke Monster from Lost and is disguising himself in humanoid form as a modification of his John Locke form. </TEXT>

But, yeah, I'm waiting for my fleet to get a Tier V Shipyard, so I can get the Fleet Credits Odyssey and the FC Aquarius.

I'm saving up my Zen to buy a lifetime sub. I'm waiting for the dilithium exchange price to drop down again towards about 150-160 before buying more Zen. I've already got a little over 7000 Zen, and I've got almost 1,000,000 dilithium in "reserve" across three of my characters (~300K each) (the other is my TOS character, but I'm waiting to continue on until I can set the registry of my ships. It's a rule of mine that once the ship goes out, its design, name and registry are "locked in").

I'm waiting for the dilithium market to drop down again, like I said, as well as for a sale to get to the lifetime sub after I have enough Zen. 

One, because I don't have the $250, and two, because it would be kind of a feat unto itself to acquire even 12,500 Zen using only the dilithium exchange, let alone all 25,000, so bragging rights. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-03-07 07:52:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For those that have completed *Empire's End*, we know that Rae Sloane survives and is (probably) a key founder of the First Order (whose name she coins).

What my thought was is this:

What if Rey isn't Rey Skywalker/Kenobi/Fett/whatever, what if, instead, she's the daughter of two generic Imps-turned-Orderites, but the key to her history comes from her name, having being named for likely FO co-founder Rae Sloane?

Perhaps she was left on Jakku while her parents fled (or whatever), and, if she only knew her name by sound, not spelling, she would have spelled it "Rey" instead.

Also, since Jakku was the place from where the remainders of the loyal Imperial fleet fled to the Unknown Regions, it would probably be stop number one on a departure vector from the UR into the wider galaxy. And, because of that, her parents might have stopped off to re-provision, fuel up (/get a different ship?) and decided to leave her there for her own safety while they went on the run indefinitely.

I think its a pretty decent theory. What do you think? </TEXT>

But, if I'm interpreting you right, a large part of it comes down to the fact that African-Americans have been inside borders of the United States, whatever they may be, longer, while Latinos have only been here since around mid-1800s, when California and Texas were added, and that civil rights tends to be looked at through more of an Atlantic Coast lens, versus a national lens? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now, and for the last 10 years, I've been living in Texas (San Antonio area), but I'm an emigrant from San Francisco East Bay.
I'm working on getting my teaching certification for high school (well, 8-12) history (/government/geography/econ) and I've been eyeing moving to either Tacoma or Olympia, or maybe to Portland.

For you Portland residents I had a few questions:

* How's the humidity? (More = better)

* How much snow do you usually get annually? And when is it worst? Same, but for rain.

* What's the mosquito and bug situation?

* What's the traffic like? And is it frontage roads or cloverleafs?

* How are the public schools?

* If I'm not a sports guy, how bad of a stink-eye will I get from sportsball fans? Is Portland a Seahawks town? Or more of a Sportsball Apathetics town?

* How are the beaches? (Sand or rock? Always crowded or only on weekends? etc.)

* What outdoor activities are there? Like parks, zoos, aquariums (I know they're usually indoors, but you get my point), etc.

* How are the summers?

* Any weird regional smells (like the "Aroma of Tacoma")?

* How is public transportation? Bike-friendliness? Pedestrian-friendliness?

* Crime rate?

* Movie theaters? Best Buys? Targets? (etc.)

* Obligatory "how much like Portlandia is it"?

Crime rate?
Movie theaters?
Best Buys?

* How religious is the area? Liberal vs. conservative? (I'm an apathetic agnostic atheist Bernie-crat who voted for Hillary) I assume that it's, at least, pushing 1970s Berkeley politically?

* Anything else you think I should know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the basic UFP light cruiser, Miranda-class, ShiKahr-class, and...the other one, what would you think if there were "Saratoga", "Lantree" and "Soyuz" cosmetic options?

"Saratoga" (for Sisko's *Saratoga* at Wolf 359) would be no rollbar and side-mounted pods. The deflector could either be forward rim mounted (like the NX-01) or on the bottom of the saucer, just above the lower dome.

"Lantree" would be no rollbar or pods.

"Soyuz" would have a "tail", like ShiKahr, I believe it is, with upper and lower pods.

	<TEXT> As for your first point, Star Wars kind of forced the issue with the full reboot of everything. I mean, they even had an ongoing series set in what would now be 10 years after Force Awakens, and they just nixed that line in favor of the unified canon.

I mean, at the point where the post-ROTJ novels ended in 2014, Chewie had been dead for a good 15-20 years.

As for your second point, it would be a 100% pure reboot, stripping Star Trek back to just the TV series and movies, the "official" canon, and any and all currently ongoing novel series would be ended, as would any comics (or, in the case of comics miniseries, allowed to finish their run, since they are usually only 4 to 6 issues long) and the Story Group equivalent would then work with currently contracted authors to work on developing a new canon set of novels, that would kill the official story of what happened in between series, and even after Enterprise and the Romulan War.

As for games, because Star Trek Online is already six years deep, and it's set after Nemesis, it wouldn't be too troublesome to just allow them to tell their own stories, and make it a semi-official third timeline (after Prime and Kelvin).

And, maybe like how Clone Wars was the only non-film element that was canon after the reboot, dub the IDW Star Trek movie comics canon, as well as the continuation, and currently running, "Boldly Go" series, as, to Bad Robot, they are part of the Kelvin Timeline canon. (for example, in Star Trek Into Darkness, Kirk mentioned the "Mudd Incident", which was a reference to the events of Star Trek: Countdown to Darkness, a prequel comics miniseries to STID. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think we would have as much butthurt, either.

Especially in the 90s, Star Wars was very heavy in literary material. Like, Star Wars *was* the books. The 90s were really kind of the heyday of Star Wars novels and comics, and, with the story group, we are experiencing a second heyday *because* of the official and canon interconnectivity. For example, Saw Gerrera, who originally debuted in The Clone Wars, was a relatively major character in Rogue One, and had a major role in last week's Rebels. I very much doubt anybody who originates in Trek novels will ever appear on screen. 

I mean, Thrawn, who was originally from the novels and pretty much only appeared in his three novels, became a much-beloved villain of Star Wars, even after the canon reboot, and has been re-canonized and is now a major antagonist in the current season of Rebels.

Even in the post-Enterprise era, yes, obviously the books and comics sold well enough to warrant their continued production, but they don't have the fan base that Star Wars novels and comics do.

	<TEXT> Same. I've head-canoned TGTMD, the "Rise of the Federation" series , the Kelvin timeline comics, etc.

But, such a story group would require a total purge, that is, stripping Trek down to the TV shows and movies. Then again, since everything *but* those are officially non-canon, it wouldn't be as hard as it was with SW (see: Thrawn).

That being said, I highly doubt any major revelations (e.g. Snoke's backstory) are going to be published first in books.

But, there are a lot of nifty "side-stories", like "Catalyst", the prequel to Rogue One, gives a history of the Erso family, as well background to Tarkin   Krennic's relationship. The movie did that well in it's own right, giving details as necessary, but "Catalyst" fleshed-out the pre-Rogue One years, and Part III of the Aftermath trilogy is due out in February, detailing the last year of the Empire, up through the Battle of Jakku which was, effectively, the death blow to the Empire.

For example: There could be a Voyager novel that is a prequel to "Ashes to Ashes" about the away mission that Lyndsay Ballard died on. Or a novel series set in 2200 about the adventures of the USS *Starship* exploring the Mystery Expanse. Or, hell, even a novel series set in alt-2240s about the USS *Fahrenheit*, a retrofitted Kelvin-type using some of the first reverse-engineered tech derived from the scans the Kelvin took of the Narada.

And Star Trek Online would be allowed to continue as a "third timeline", allowing it to continue doing its thing and telling its stories without worry of any potential canon conflicts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Star Trek would purge back to just the movies and shows, and rebuild from there, like SW did.

2) Besides X-Men/Deadpool and Fantastic Four, pretty much everything else falls under the Marvel Cinematic Universe banner, even Spider-man, who is still officially under Sony, is now part of the MCU, with Feige ultimately steering the ship (at least as far as broad strokes are concerned), so it's now all one cohesive universe with a consistent canon. They had to do a Spider-man reboot for the MCU, since a) the Andrew Garfield movies underperformed relative to expectations, and 2) they wouldn't have meshed with the existing MCU.

Even the DC movies, god help them, are under one unified canon. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Like how Lucasfilm has it's Story Group that manages the Star Wars canon, what would you think if there was a Star Trek equivalent?

So that, instead of there being a multitude of varying data (look at pretty much any article on Memory Beta), it's all one big unified canon. 

For example, the official Trek canon has "These Are the Voyages" being the official canon: Trip dies, no one got promoted during the Romulan War, etc., whereas *[The Good That Men Do](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Good_That_Men_Do)* (a *highly* recommended read, by the way) retcons it that what we see in TATV (this is revealed in Chapter 1, so it's not mega-spoilery) is all Section 31 coverup shenanigans to hide the real truth and that TATV was actually set in 2155, following "Terra Prime" and not 2161 as Federation history records (and people are promoted during the Romulan War. Reed even ends up in command of the *Intrepid*, like in "Twilight" and T'Pol ends up getting the Columbia-class (refitted NX-class) USS Endeavour NCC-06.)

With a Story Group, *The Good That Men Do* would be part of the official Star Trek canon.

I dunno.

I really think that ST could benefit from a Story Group-like body. Even Marvel has one, in the form of Kevin Feige.

	<TEXT> Since they've added the alt-Ent and the Vengeance, as well as the D4x and the Romulan intel cruiser, what would you think if they added the Kelvin-type as a Tier 2 premium escort (Zen purchase).

It'd have 2 forward and 1 aft weapons port and default weapons are photon torpedoes and phaser turrets (180) forward and a photon torpedo launcher aft. And the special universal console would be Combat Impulse (which also causes the warp nacelle to flare, like in the movie), which sets the ship to Full Impulse, maximizes weapons power and engines (and drops shields and aux to 5), and gives you 450% maneuverability. All of this expires after 30 seconds and requires 5 minutes to recharge.

Oh, and it'd have three skins: "Kelvin", the primary skin, "Prime", skinning it like the prime 1701 (smooth grey) and "Battle-damage", replicating the battle damage the Kelvin took from the Nerada.

	<TEXT> At the very top of my Transwarp list, before "Fleet Starbase", is an option called "Beta Quadrant", distinct from the other Beta Quadrant option.

For shits and giggles, I decided to click on it and see what happened. It transwarped me to Beta Penthe in the Mempa Sector, deep in Klingon space.

I found nothing on the STO Wiki about a transwarp option to the Mempa Sector, so, where did it come from? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What with the sale coming up, I was looking to get a few low value (like the NX prefix) C-Store items.(I'm saving up to get a lifetime subscription. I'm already at a little over 3000. It's going to be a while.)

I was wondering if there was anywhere, or if any of you, had a list of items that are available both individually and in packs in the C-Store, like the "NX-class replica", which is available on its own, as well as part of the Enterprise pack (or whatever it's called). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's actually a newer hard drive, relative to the age of the computer. A few years old (vs 8-10). The original hard drive crashed, but, fortunately, it was a recoverable crash, so we were able to move the data from the original to this one. </TEXT>

So, is there a way to plug it in and move the files to the new HD, without it "forgetting" the files? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom is getting a new computer (currently using one running XP, getting a new one with W10 because TurboTax won't support XP for the 2016 Tax Season).

Basically, the question is if we can just transfer (i.e., physically move) her HDD into the new computer and let the computer "reformat" it to speak W10, or do we have to move all the files over to external HD/Dropbox/etc. and then over to her W10 computer? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5hywuu/question_about_nfcafc_standings_from_an_outsider/)

Right now, Pittsburgh is 8-5/2-1 and 3rd in AFC and the Raiders are 10-3/2-2 and 1st AFC Wild Card.

If Pittsburgh loses their next conference game, will they and the Raiders switch spots because they will be tied in AFC W/L, but the Raiders have a better overall win-loss ratio? </TEXT>

We knew Tarkin was it from the most recent trailers, and Leia was a pleasant surprise, but I lost my shit when Dreis and Vander appeared on screen.

Like, seriously, I lost my absolute shit. I have to buy the theater a new seat. That's how much shit was lost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What does the variance indicate?

And what does the SD indicate? Like, how do you know 3.76-8.24 is "normal". I mean, if this was erect penis length in inches, 3.76 probably qualifies as micropenis.

And what's the 65-95-99.7 rule?


And I assume there are computer programs designed just to find SD, like of the height of the average American male^TM?

	<TEXT> He most likely knows *exactly* who R2 is, especially considering who his travel companion is. 

Remember: R2 has never had his mind wiped. Everything he experienced is still in there. He knows who Vader really is, he knows who Luke and Leia are, he and Ben know each other very well (Ben said he never remembered owning a droid, which is 100% true. R2 was Anakin's.)

R2 knows everything. </TEXT>
