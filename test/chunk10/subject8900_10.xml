	<TEXT> I try to use only good, trusted brands. I live in Spain, so I can't usually find out in examine if something is really good or bad according to them, because many of the american brands aren't sold here. I use mainly two brands: Solgar and Solaray. Solaray, according to many specialized shops here is very good, very trusted, apart from that, I can't say much... I trust Spanish health   food regulations, but I always doubt. I'm not the kind of person anti medication all together or something like that, but if I can not use something I won't...

	<TEXT> I agree completely and I don, t look for that at all, but I find that several doctor I,ve had don,t even try to discuss or take into consideration what you know or think you know. Sometimes I think that as everyone's looking forr information over the internet they are oversensitive before even listening to you saying anything that maybe even have sense or you, ve studied. I don, t know much about supplements but I, ve taking D chiro inositol after extensively reading about it and I don, t think  is ok that I go, happy to have found something I, m sure is working and a doctor tells me "You don't need that". I felt so sad bevause it took me a long time to find something. I talked once to another ob gyn that talked to me about inositol and more things and I really liked how he seemed to be interested and receptive, not only looked at me over thee shoulder and dismissed my ideas.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know what to do. I've been to my OB GYN and a new endocrine, I don't have a GP now because I've moved. My OB GYN know nothing about PCOS really, she just says I have to TTC for a year and then see if I have a problem and the endocrine says all the supplements are unnecessary. Honestly, maybe they are but I'm completely sure I'm ovulating thanks to my PCOS supplement, ergo, because of D Chyro Inositol. I had problems with my period for two years, I started taking it, anything else, I started having my period every 28 days, one month, November, they didn't arrive on time, I didn't take it for about 10 days, I didn't have my period. I don't think that's faith or magical thinking. I don't like the naturopaths I've seen where I live, I don't trust them, but I don't like many doctors and if I change I have to wait months for a new appointment. So... I'm lost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello,

I'm a 32F and I'm going to try to get pregnant for the first time this month. I've been in my doctor and OB GYN last year and I don't have a new appointment until april, so, meanwhile, I have some concerns about my current herbs and supplements. I've written more or less this same post in /r/TryingForaBaby, and some redditors have told me that I should substitute the vitamins and folic acid and zinc for a prenatal vitamin complex but I'm trying to save money and vitamins are expensive, so, I want to know if is not the same taking what I'm taking than a prenatal because I rather finish my bottles... And nobody is sure about the herbs, I thought maybe you could help me with that as what I read over the internet is quite confusing.

Here it is what I'm taking: 

* Solaray Spectro Energy Vitamins: [here](http://smimport.com/complementos/ver/307) are the components.
* Solgar Folacin (Folic Acid 400 micrograms)
* Solgar Zinc Citrate
* Pcos capsules (D-chiro inositol, Vitamin B5, manganese glutonate, Vitamin B6, Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin D3, y Vitamin B12).
* Solaray Omega 3, 6, 9 capsules.
* Maca root powder
* Spirulina Powder
* Matcha tea
* Curcumin (I use to spice vegetables)
* Ginger (the same)
* Cayenne pepper (also, to spice vegetables and fish)
* Fennel (for soups)
* Calendula (as a tea)
* Lemon grass (as a tea)
* Sacred bark + aloe vera capsules (for digestion).

	<TEXT> Ok, thank you, I just thought that it was more or less the same thing. I've been reading about some preconceptives and I see they have more or less the same as what I'm taking, but sure, they maybe have other things that I'm not counting on. About Metformin, I'm trying not to use chemicals, at least, the first 3 months TTC, also, I told my OB-GYN about metformin the first time I readit and she says she doesn't prescribe that... So, I don't know, I wanted to change to a doctor that has experience in PCOS, but where I live, I guess there is none... Thanks for your advises! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for your advise, so helpful. About the first four thing, honestly, they are expensive and my bottles are almost new so I rather take those until I finish them if is the same as taking one pre natal vitamin, what do you think?

I'm going to ask in supplements subreddit about the spices. 

And thanks for that, I'm feeling really old lately :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I should change my doctor, but I can't do it right away, it takes time to find a new one and get an appointment, and I just want to know if there is anything that I should cut off, because I find sources that says this is bad, or the other is abortive, or stops ovulation. I know I don't have to do an special diet, but I think is important to be healthy and to take care of what I'm eating, is complicated to find a balance and I could really use some help in the things I'm asking... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello,

I'm 32F and this is my first month TTC. I started reading things a few months ago and I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. I can't stop thinking I'm too old, I've smoked a lot in my life, I won't be able to have children, and so, everything's a struggle. But, my main concern these days is diet. I started trying to avoid some unhealthy things and progressively I cut caffeine, tea, everything that is prepacked, that have sugars, that has conservative, additives. 

So, my diet now is: fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, fish, meat, water and some olive oil. And I think is ok, but I've read that fish is bad for fertility. And I take a bunch of supplements and herbs and spices, and I can't figure out which ones should I stop taking. 

So, please, I would be so greatful if some of you tell me if you think I should cut some of these things. 

* Solaray Spectro Energy Vitamins: [here](http://smimport.com/complementos/ver/307) are the components.
* Solgar Folacin (Folic Acid 400 micrograms)
* Solgar Zinc Citrate
* Pcos capsules (D-chiro inositol, Vitamin B5, manganese glutonate, Vitamin B6, Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin D3, y Vitamin B12).
* Solaray Omega 3, 6, 9 capsules.
* Maca root powder

* Ginger (the same)
* Cayenne pepper (also, to spice vegetables and fish)
* Fennel
* Calendula (as a tea)
* Lemon grass (as a tea)
* Sacred bark + aloe vera capsules.
  
I know I should go to my doctor, but I've talked to her several times about supplements and diet and she just say everything I do is unnecessary, but my health and mood has improved a lot since I started taking some supplements and making some changes in my habits. So, if you could just tell me if there is something that I definitely should cut off of check...

Thank you very much </TEXT>

I had never used a cleanser before that left my skin like that, smooth, oil free and I've noticed less and less pimples since I'm using it (december 2016). Is just completely different the feeling of your skin when you use this than with other cleansers. I've used: Lullage acne xpert, Avene gel cleanser, Cosrx Good Morning Cleanser, Kiehl's Calendula wash and some others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello,

I lived the same experience as you. Last year, with 31 I started having acne all the sudden and it took me several months to improve it. I recommend you to follow the advises of /r/SkincareAddiction and these blogs: [Skinacea](http://www.skinacea.com/) and [Simple Skincare Science](https://simpleskincarescience.com/get-rid-of-acne/), and above all to see a dermatologist asap. I also startet a keto diet and took some supplements (zinc, magnesium and omega 3), but what really helped me to start improving was antibiotics that my derm prescribed me.

Edit: sorry, I didn't read you comment first about the dermatologist. I hope you find something that works for you, there are a lot of helpful resources here, I also read /r/Acne frequently. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-08 19:11:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello,

I've just bought the [Sr Skincare Mandelic Acid 15%](http://www.sr-skincare.co.uk/mandelic-acid-peel-162-p.asp) and I had the idea of using it twice a week or so, but the product came with detailed instructions about how you should use it once a week, for 6 weeks, leaving it 1, 2, 3... minutes each time (you must neutralice it with the gel that comes with the acid itself). So, my question is if I someone has experience with this peel or similar ones. I've been using acids for almost a year (first Paula's choice 2% BHA, then Cosrx bha blackhead power liquid and lately Neostrata salicylic gel plus 15 AHA for a few months) so my skin is somehow used to peels.

Thanks in advance.  </TEXT>
