Which bothers me of course, because these games should be more about battles. But what irks me most is that most of the battles that I play are defensive siege battles, and I thought that since RTW2 CA wanted to DECREASE the amount of siege battles.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> And its not because of the performance, its because of the non-nonsensical AI, I am basically bombarded by stupid AI diplomatic offers, which I have to decline for dozens if not hundreds of turns, which is really goddamn annoying. 

These are are the two most common:

1. A faction is asking for a non-aggression agreement but for a lot of money, chances are they are gonna break it anyway since we have bad relations, anyway they ask this EVERY turn!

2. This one is a bit more showing of how shortsighted CA were. Let's say you are Rome, and you have a military ally in western Europe and a military ally in Greece, for whatever reason you declare war on a faction in Eastern Mediterranean or you get attacked. That means you have the option to call upon your allies. What the game doesn't let you do is choose which ones, which is stupid. Anyway you go to war, you make peace BUT your allies do not make peace, which means every turn you get asked to join a war by a faction that is an entire continent away from the one you are asked to attack... Of course the other allies are asking you that too, but at least if they are close to the warring faction I can get that.

This would have been so much easier if I could just pick allies relevant to the war. I don't need the Iceni to fight in Egypt...


Anyway, I have never seen anybody complaining about this, but its truly annoying. Its present in Attila and WTW too, but on a lesser scale. </TEXT>

No, no, just no. I understand you are asking a question, but you could have done at least a small google search. Plater armored knights didn't move like in Stronghold games because the armor wasn't that heavy. And bodybuilders aren't really that strong, they just look shredded.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shermer exposed like Bill Nye recently how full of shit "science guys and skeptics" are. They go for the low hanging fruit of flat earth, no climate change, bigfoot, creationist etc... people with crazy ideas and who are ideologues. But when they hit with people that are informed and who are actually trying to present a possibility it makes them look dumb and even narrow minded.

Michael obviously didn't do his research this episode and it made him look stupid. I'm not saying Graham is right 100%, but he cites scientist works, he spoke personally to some of the experts and he went to those places. So clearly he is not talking out of his ass, and he also clearly states that he was wrong in the past. 

I mean you can clearly see it when Michael starts mentioning creationists and alien nuts, he obviously got used to that shit and wants to put Randall and Graham into those categories to make them look stupid and not worth bother. 

As for mainstream science, well wasn't all science at some point non-mainstream, like it had to be a new alternative option before it got accepted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The Science Guy" perfectly reflects everything wrong with the American society. That's something I've noticed from childhood or basically since when I understood English. 

It always confused me what do Americans think is science. It still does. It seems like people in the US like to clutter all the sciences into one big pile and expect people to be "experts" in all of them. Like the differentiation between physics and chemistry is non-existent. 

So as a kid I always couldn't understand, what the hell is "science class". Now it just seems like its a poor aspect of American culture. Its like a big underestimation or underappreciated of the sciences and promotion of the idiotic jock culture that seemed to have started in the 50s and had its heyday in the 80s. 

If you want to go further with this, its also the same reason why they seem to just associate nerds with comic books, movies and actual science, which never made sense to me. 

Anyway, Bill Nye is exposing this majorly, his incompetence in various fields is showing how bad the terminology of science is and how Americans use the term leisurely. That's why I dislike SciShow or anything like that, you just cannot be an expert in all these fields, you cannot talk about that with so much confidence, there is more to science than the word "science". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a weird question. I am training in a budget MMA gym, and lots of guys including me are hurting their feet since we do it barefoot or just with socks on the mats. Its really starting to be annoying, when the your joint connecting the thumb finger and the foot hurts whatever you do. 

In general I would say those joints seem to get into trouble, right now my left hand thumb is the only one that doesn't hurt. At first I thought I was just a pussy, but more and more guys are telling me this, and it really feels annoying. Like my right finger thumb hurts for more than a month now, since even when starts recovering I accidentally hurt it, and we go again. If I took time off to recover these, I feel like I would never train, since they seem so easy to injure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's some that that pissed me off pre and post UFC 211.

Yair Hype? Why was there hype? He beat nobodies and an ancient relic. He had like two or three highlight real moves. 

Stipe being this unbeatable beast? What? He maybe is the best right now in HW, but he's not an unstoppable killer, Overeem almost finished him in the first fucking round, and the HW division is a dinosaur division. 

Francis Ngannou hype... Again, why is there hype, I don't get this, who has he beat? What have we seen from him? Until he destroys a fighter with some momentum there is no way he should fight Stipe.

People claiming (at least according to Ariel) that Joanna is the best p4p fighter right now in the UFC, not best striker, best FIGHTER? Just gtfo...

I'm so sick of these hype trains. When will people fucking learn, later on they will hate these fighters when they lose , because they were totally overrated. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I often come across this problem when thinking of watching a new show or a new season of a show and I read or talk about the reactions. A lot of people seem like they cannot understand that just because a character is not to their liking that it doesn't mean its a bad character. 

Even that if you hate the character, that again that doesn't mean the writers did a bad job, hell, maybe they even did a great job. I guess the best case scenario is a character that you "love to hate", but that creates other problems. 

I personally have missed out on a few shows and seasons, or rather I got too late for them because of some "bad characters". Unfortunately people like to project their persona bias too much and their own perspective. 

I just wonder am I the only one with this problem, and how do other people deal with it. Because lets face it, watching a movie with one badly written character is digestible, but a multiple season series? There is a lot of risk in it. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-05-15 17:56:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Michael Hirst, creator of the Show: "I especially had to take liberties with Vikings because no one knows for sure what happened in the Dark Ages...we want people to watch it. A historical account of the Vikings would reach hundreds, occasionally thousands, of people. Here weve got to reach millions."

Well that's rather dumb and shortsighted and incorrect, we actually do know what happened, for the most part. But I am not here to talk about historical accuracy, more about "authenticity". So its not about changing the show, just its look or its feel and maybe a few battles. 

You see I've noticed that they take great pains to have lingual authenticity, which I compliment them, they really did a good compromise with it. Though they still make some annoying unnecessary things, like using words like sex or race, which can be said differently and feel more appropriate. Or why can't they call Norse nobles Jarls? Why is that so hard? Is there some precious demographic that will stop watching the show if they used the word Jarl? I just don't get that. 


Now here is what pisses me off. It seems like this show is on a crusade against authentic armor and even weapons to some degree. It would be safe to say that no a single authentic armor is present in the show, maybe I missed some though. But for the most part its a joke, and in the 4th season it feels like the show is intentionally provoking. Why is King Ecbert wearing a plate armor? That's like having an Abrams tank in a show about Napoleon, even worse. 


I just don't get why do they dress up the cast in some kind of kinky cosplay. When the armor at the time looked pretty damn cool. Even budget wise that isn't hard, since only a minority of Vikings (or of any population at the time) carried expensive chain mail armor and helmets, most of other people carried padded armor, which is fairly ease to replicate. Here's a descent [example](http://i.imgur.com/9V11Mam.jpg)
Of course the armor doesn't have to be 100% authentic, but that isn't really that hard, you don't need hundreds of experts to do that. 

Then why the fuck are Vikings so rarely seen using a DANE axe, its a cool badass weapon and it looks like that, even Rollo's axe felt to short to me. Also its called the DANE axe for a reason.

Then why aren't the Franks, using their famous cavalry, I mean that was their whole shtick, that was why they were famous among other things and that was what created problems for the norse raiders. Of course there were other things to Carolingian conquest, but cavalry is a cool way to represent it in the show. In general I hate how Franks are represented as a degenerate Game of Thrones style empire without competent warriors.Ugh... 

Its just that, if you were to make a fantasy show inspired by Sengoku Jidai you would still have Samurai in their armor, katanas, naginatas etc... I hope you see what I am getting it. You are supposed to play to the strengths of the historical period, what makes it stand out aesthetically and story wise. Saving Private Ryan isn't a history book, but it has freaking machine guns, snipers, Tiger tanks etc... None of my suggestions could ever harm the show's ratings, on the contrary I think they could only increase the views. There is just nobody out there who doesn't want to see badass viking armor but wants to watch a show called "vikings". The only thing that might be a challenge to the budget would be the Frankish cavalry, but maybe they should stop wasting money on side characters and plot lines that go nowhere.

EDIT: I just realized that the costume design from Vikings is like from [Xena:Warrior Princes](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/to-hollywood-and-beyond/images/1/17/Joxer-Ep3.2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140313210251) or [Hercules](http://68.media.tumblr.com/dff35fff778cf7694e6f86851e5c27ce/tumblr_n5wwi35Shg1rhorj5o6_1280.jpg).

	<TEXT> I agree with the OP 100%, the show has too many "filler". I noticed even in the first season with the warrior that seeks death. A hotline that went nowhere, like many others that just go nowhere. They just waste time that can be spent on developing characters. 

Yidu was a huge disappointment, I still don't get the point, none of it made any impact on anything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically all wars of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17ct. If they didn't happened Eastern, Southern and Northern Europe would probably be radically different.

Those wars basically exhausted PL-C and made its demise inevitable. They enabled the rise of Prussia and Russia as the dominant players, they prolonged the longevity of Crimean Khanate and Ottoman's empire presence in Europe, they halted the rise of the Swedish empire, they also had a strong role in forming the Ukrainian national identity.

For some context, a battle during the Cossack uprising, called [Battle of Berestechko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berestechko)  was probably the biggest battle in 17ct, at least in Europe. 

I mean these were some huge wars, with huge parts of populations moved, cities destroyed, entire cultures migrating.  PL-C was also quite a peculiar state, with an elected monarch, senate and latin among its official languages. It also had a strong presence of art, music, poetry, education among its older cities like Warsaw and Krakow.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I wanted to listen his latest livestream about Syria, anyway I play it, and guess what? On my current volume, I cannot understand Sargon's mumbling but I can understand the other guy clearly. 

This means I either have to raise the volume on my speakers or put fucking headphones on, neither of which I feel like to do, and I will tell you why. Because I do never, ever have to do that on any other podcast, and I listen quite a lot of them. I think its two years that I am listening to Sargon, and this problem persists, whenever he talks with several individuals, its impossible to setup the volume to a nice balance, you either cannot understand Sargon quite well or that somebody is too loud. 

Dr. Layman is annoying in this issue too, but Sargon practically lives from this and has descent income, so I don't get why doesn't he do something about this, I can't be the only that has a problem with it. Again, I feel like out of all possible podcasts that I ever heard, I never experienced such a problem so consistently as with Sargon.  </TEXT>
