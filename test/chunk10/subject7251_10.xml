	<TEXT> Yes the reload is definitely an issue, I think Chilled Reload is pretty much a must on it, helps some. Man I would poop myself for a Sobek Wraith right now lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with the justice mod. The justice mod for the Hek is so damn good, they really need to give the Sobek justice mod an update to put it on equal footing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just finished putting 4 formas in to my Sobek, and I have to say I love it. I do have a great riven for it, but imo, acid shells is quite powerful. Reload speed is, I think, it's only real negative, but it isn't as bad with Chilled Reload. Anyway was just wondering what you all thought, also, I'm REALLY hoping for a Sobek Wraith soon. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Some *Spoilers* about the show Genius, and a question about the history of his first love Marie Winteler </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-17 17:57:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the latest episode of the show Genius, Einsteins first girlfriend Marie Winteler's brother (can't remember his name) goes crazy and shoots and kills his mother, and then turns the gun on himself committing suicide. I have tried to find some information on the internet and haven't really been successful. My question is, did this actually happen historically? If someone smarter than myself could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. TY! </TEXT>
