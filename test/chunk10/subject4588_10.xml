	<TEXT> That's just the beginning, because the restaurant business is just shitty no matter where you are situated. As someone who has been in the NYC restaurant business for a few years, the (Front-of-house) staff are no better. I lived *in the goddamn South* and the worst racism I faced came from NYC waiters. One waiter, a grade-A asshole, got shitfaced off stolen wine and proceeded to fuck up multiple tables in his section by messing up their checks in a restaurant that sees four-figure checks nightly. He was fired on sight.

The Back-of-house/dishwashers/cooks? They're cool. I'm out of that space completely and my mental health has never been better. 

EDIT: Obviously I needed to vent. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIFU by playing golf in the house </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-02 19:17:53 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Obligatory "this happened a while back." About five years ago.

So I was living with my sister and her husband for a few months, and when they would both go to work I would be at home with the dog. So after playing some Wii Golf and watching some daytime TV one afternoon, I was bored so I decided to explore the house to find some interesting shit.

So I'm in the garage when I see a set of golf clubs gathering dust. I look in one of the side bags and there are some golf balls. The garage was empty so I practice some swings with the driver (not hitting anything, of course). But since I wanted to watch more TV *and* work on my (nonexistent) golf game, I moved inside the house.

So I enter the house and, not wanting to hit anything, I took the putter instead. Got a cup to be the "hole" and decided to go in. Now I was putting right under a pretty pricey chandelier, just so you know. After knocking a few putts in, I get bored. That should have been my cue to stop. But u/subject4588 had other plans.

So I think to myself: "let me try some weird shots." For my first one I decide to take a huge backswing (with a SOLID. METAL. PUTTER) then just putt instead of following through. I take the backswing and I'm not at the top of it before *the sound broken glass makes combined with a full realization of one's stupidity.* I run out from under the falling glass, and then I see the carnage. The centerpiece chandelier is broken, a third of it missing. I run out to neighbors houses to ask if they had glue (wow) or something to help cover up my fuck-up. Safe to say, my sister and brother-in-law both got home and I got into huge trouble. I didn't get the laptop I wanted that Xmas, and I spent my weekends picking up dogshit in the yard for the remainder of my time there.

TL;DR: Played Wii golf, got bored. Explored house, found real golf clubs/balls. Decided to putt indoors until I had better ideas, i.e. take a backswing, which broke expensive crystal chandelier. Spent weekends picking up dogshit as punishment.

EDIT: Added words </TEXT>
