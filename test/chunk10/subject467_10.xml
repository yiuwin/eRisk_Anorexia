	<TEXT> I recently switched over to a corsair H55 closed loop system (from an old air cooler) to give some more overclocking headroom. 

I took the opportunity to switch out a lot of my 5 yo fans from he case with (what I thought) newer more efficient and quieter fans. 

Now the whole system is way louder than it used to be, while a lot of it seems to be the air pushing through the radiator, the combination of the other fans seems to be louder overall too. 

The main culprit was the stock H55 fan which creates a constant buzz but even with that replaced. There's still an ambient whirr that wasn't as noticeable before. Even with the fans turned to half speed. 

Y? And what can I try? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Differences between Xeon W3680 and X5680 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-04 11:50:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've noticed some suggestions in a couple of threads about buying an older xeon chip to OC on a LGA 1366 mobo. Two good options look like the X5680 and the W3680. They look similar in spec but I'm wondering which will be better for the actual use ...overclocking and gaming. (and whether there's any better chips out there also that my setup will support) 

My mobo is an Asus P6x58d-e and I've been running an i7 930 since they came out. Instead of a full overhaul right now it would be great to get more milage out of the current system by simply OC'ing an old Xeon. Especially as I've got access to a couple of GTX titans through work that are being severely bottlenecked at the moment with the old chip. </TEXT>

My brother and I went there when he was teaching in China. We had a proper adventure just finding the place after jumping in what turned out to be a 4 hour taxi to get there. 

They dropped us somewhere random in the city and we then had the task of finding our hotel with nothing but a crappy printout map and some Chinese symbols. 

Good memories.

	<TEXT> When working with particle systems its a good idea to have two separate versions of the objects your working with.

So here you will have one version the pipes that are the ones you're going to render (with bits cut out etc). But no collider tag, they are simply to look nice.

Then you will have a copy of the piper with no cutouts that you will use as the collider (maybe with fewer polygons if possible to speed up the system). To make sure they don't render you can add a compositing tag and just turn everything off.

Its always a good idea to work with a separate collider object as they can afford to be much lower resolution which will greatly increase your simulation speed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember having a book when i was a kid full of cool spaceship illustrations. Unfortunately I cant remember a whole lot about it but I saw an image just today that took my memory right back and I'd love to find a copy of that book again!

It looks like it was a collection of sci-fi book front covers from the 70s but I'm 100% sure it didn't have the title text of each book.

[I've managed to track down some of the books the covers were from so here are a few.](http://imgur.com/a/TV7X1)

Maybe a lot of them are Tony Roberts but I'm not convinced it was a collection solely of his work.

Maybe it really is truly lost to my childhood but I'd love to find it again! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Explosive Leg Training for Downhill </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-24 11:27:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was wondering what you guy's suggestions are for off the bike training with regards to the explosive and tensional strength needed for riding downhill. That is, more time pedaling and absorbing shocks with your bum off the seat.

This weekend I went for my first trails ride of the season and i was surprised how quickly my legs got tired when not sat on the saddle. Rock climbing, swimming, road bikes and dirt jumping has trained my stamina quite well over winter, (upper body strength isn't an issue and I can pedal uphill in the saddle for ever). But there's definitely something missing.

Perhaps there's some specific weight training or other regimen that will help over the season to train the fast twitch leg muscles necessary for downhill? </TEXT>

Recipe time:

Blend up your stale bread with a tonne of paprika and garam masala. Slice up your chicken breast and jook it up in flour. Douse it in whisked egg then coat in breadcrumbs. Shallow fry those badbuoies for a couple of minutes on each side, punch with salt and pepper and enjoy with a side of chilli mayo. You're welcome.  </TEXT>

Seriously, there's so many experiences and combinations of sights, sounds, tastes, smells and feels to assault the senses without even considering where in the world they might take place. 

You could be mountain biking down a beautiful winding trail in Peru above the clouds or cooking a delicious dish for two in your own kitchen. Anyone who says they've done it all is a big fat phoney.

Just create your two camera's, one being  a frontal view that you want to animate to. Select your 2 (or more) ceres and go to create-camera morph. You'll be given another camera with a slider that you can animate to morph between the two cameras you created.  </TEXT>

I use Cinema 4D for the 3D design, animation and rendering.

	<TEXT> I've always loved the idea of diving and will practically throw myself off any cliff that has deep enough water at the bottom. Now I'm a bit older It would be great to learn to do it with a bit more style and in a controlled environment. is it best to just start taking a beginner course?

How old do you generally have to be to get into it with no previous experience? I'm relatively agile but I've never done dance or proper supervised gymnastics. I do Rock climb, mountain bike and swim though which i would hope would help with some dexterity.

I should mention I'm 25. </TEXT>
