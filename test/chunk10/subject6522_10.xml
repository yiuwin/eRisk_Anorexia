	<TEXT> The trailer for the first season of The Americans gave me the impression that it's in the action thriller genre but the whole show is actually a family drama with spy elements. Still a good show though. Any similar experience you had with some other shows? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're in for a ride, my friend. It's one of the best shows on network TV sa US. It'll feel very CSI for the first few seasons but trust me the show will evolve into something much more complex once it delves deeper into its AI mythos.  </TEXT>
