	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know it's really stupid. But i got directed to a really cool song on soundcloud while listening to Steven Universe. I remember the title has "poison" in it but i am not sure. Many stated out that they had been directed there while listening to Aivi   Surasshu too. Please help me find the song

Edit: The song is about a girl calling her ex's SO toxic/poison, but then realize it was her jealousy talking. ( please pardon the cheese i really want to find the song ) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're misunderstanding my point. Death penalty is a good thing, i know, i deserve it. But stripping my character and break immersion is not the best way to go. Imagine a system where your client is turned off everytime you die, you go and complain on reddit and someone tell you "stop crying and stop asking everything to be a walk in the park" </TEXT>

Ps: asked this in /r/studyAbroad but there doesn't seem to be any active member there, so i brought the post here

	<TEXT> Sry for my bad English. I have 3 questions and would love to hear your answer.

1. Who do you think has the most influence on your writing, more specifically on "Black Book" ?

2. If you can give one advice to an ambitious student who want to become a writer, what would it be ?

3. What is your favourite book ?

Thank you for taking your time to host this AMA, and congratulation on such an amazing achievement. </TEXT>
