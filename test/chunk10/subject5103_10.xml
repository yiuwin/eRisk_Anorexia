	<TEXT> I'm not super technical but I came across an answer I think many people (500 million to be exact) might find helpful.

I changed my Yahoo! password as recommended because of the hack but then when I went to update it on my new IPhone7 (iOS10) I couldn't find the password change option in email settings.

[I stumbled upon an Apple forum](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7678798?start=0 tstart=0) and long story short, your Yahoo! password will automatically be updated on your device for you if updated elsewhere. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIFU by driving with my keys on the hood of my car </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-23 17:56:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This morning was a comedy of errors.

I woke up late for work and instead of doing my usual 1 mile walk to work, I took my wife's car (our only current car). It is a Ford CMAX with a FOB key that you just need to have on you/in the car for it to start and run.

As I'm backing out of the driveway I notice our baby's car seat is still in the back. My wife is meeting up with her mother later to go out so she needs the seat. I get out of the car, grab the seat and start walking into the apartment... I hear two honks. I've learned that this means you are leaving the running car with the key in your pocket... and I thought that the honks meant you need to return the key or the car will shut off.

I don't know why I cared if it shut off but I did, so in my hurry I just put the keys on my hood. Opening the door and throwing them in the cup holder, like I've done before, would have taken an extra 3 seconds.

With car seat in hand, I grab for my phone to call my wife to let me in and realize I left my phone inside the apartment. I start to get flustered. I look for an open window and yell to get her attention and she buzzes me in.

I drop the seat off, grab my phone and jump back in my car and pull out of the driveway.

I arrive to work, park, get out and reach for the keys to lock the car... no keys. Panic sets in. I realize what I've done.

In desperation I reach for the engine start button and push, hoping that by some miracle the keys are in the car and that I didn't just drive to work with them on the hood. Unbeknownst to me, pushing the ignition button without possession of the key sets off the alarm.

The alarm will not shut up. I have no keys. I'm sweating. And I'm on the top of the parking garage facing the windows of my office. I decide to just walk away. I want no part of my co-workers watching me play out a scene from Curb Your Enthusiasm. Luckily, about a minute later the alarm does stop. I go inside my building.

I call my wife and she searches the driveway and the nearby street. No keys. And to make matters worse, today is street cleaning day. I ask her if the street sweeper has come by yet and she doesn't know. I decide to walk back home, scanning the busy road way on the walk.

I get all the way home - no keys. I walk back to work and stop at the Dunkin Donuts I had pulled in. No keys. I call the dealership and they say that I need to have the car towed to them and bring the title and ID to get a new key made for about $200.

I call AAA and tell them my car is in the garage. They set the appointment and then call back 20 minutes later and say they need to send a different truck to fit into the garage.

I just got back from meeting the driver who said he was going to put the car on movable jacks so he could spin it and access the front (it is front wheel drive) for a tow.

I just looked outside and he is finally leaving the garage.

After googling the FOB keys I found out that if I had just kept the keys in pocket, the car would have continued to run. The honks are just a warning.

TL;DR Left the FOB key on my hood, drove the car, it fell off, I set off the alarm and now it is being towed to the dealership.

EDIT: Just heard from the wife. $310 :-x ($250 for key, $60 for the programming)

EDIT #2: Wife is home with a loaner car. The dealership has supposedly had problems reprogramming the keys on 2013 CMAX's lately. I called to get a better explanation and lady who answered said it had something to do with "the cloud." Jesus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a Lenovo Windows 7 laptop at work. Whenever I shut down my computer, close the screen (sleep mode) or unplug it from an external monitor - the icons get jumbled and move to different spots. 

I know I can auto arrange items and have them line up on a grid but that isn't helpful for my personal style of organization.

I've tried everything and researched this extensively with no resolution. Please help. </TEXT>
