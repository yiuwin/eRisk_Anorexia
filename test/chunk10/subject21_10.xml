	<TEXT> Thank you for doing what you do and being so level headed!The one time I had to call 911 I know I was hysterical and the operator was very helpful and was obviously doing her best in a confusing and messy situation. 

When I called 911, it was for a suicide in progress I was calling in. It was a volatile situation and the operator didn't want me near the house. I asked if she'd stay on the phone with me until the sheriff called me and she did. Is that something you're obligated to do? It meant a lot to me and I wish I could thank her. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been dealing with major anxiety, depression, and PTSD for several years now. I've been on Xanax, Remeron, Ativan, and nothing has helped. I recently started smoking with a really close friend of mine. After a hit or two, I feel good. My anxiety starts to lessen, I feel more relaxed. However, as soon as the high starts to fade, I feel really depressed. The first time, I thought it was just me having a bad day, but it happens every time. 

I feel really safe with the person I'm smoking with, so they aren't the problem. Last night, we hung out and got really high. I was pretty good for about an hour, almost two. Then I started to get really depressed and super anxious. I don't know what is going on. I was wondering if any of you could help me out. Is this a thing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's about 100x stronger too. So a user takes a normal dose, they OD. So an addict gets some cheap dope, they shoot it, they OD. Some dealers use it to 'get rid' of needy buyers. Some dealers don't even know it's cut. They just sell the dope and end up killing someone. It's a huge problem.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Finally opening up about my assault in therapy... [trigger warning] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-20 06:23:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was assaulted two years ago by an abusive (now ex) boyfriend. I've told a few people about it, but only the fact that I was assaulted. No other details. This Wednesday, I finally started to open up a little more to my therapist about it. I started to get really upset and kind of dissociated from the topic and my therapist noticed pretty quickly. I told her the shame that I feel about it makes it hard to talk about. 

I was 16 when it happened. He was 19. I was at a very vulnerable time in my life and he made things seem okay. We dated for about 6 months. During those 6 months, the abuse progressed from slight manipulation, to insults, threats, screaming at me, and then it got physical. I will not go into much more detail, but the assault was violent. It has been two years and he still follows me around town. My parents are his bosses. They do not know. It is best for everyone involved if they don't.

I was talking to my therapist about the shame. It isn't just the shame of being taken advantage of, but the shame of how my body reacted. My brain wanted nothing to do with it. I could not defend myself. My body was not on the same page. I climaxed. He took notice and it got more aggressive and he got more verbal. After, he made threats ("tell anyone and i'll do it again", "i can and will hurt you", etc) and then went back to his 'normal' self. He was very tender after and I was confused.

The shame I feel talking about it prevents me from talking about it. I do not know how to handle the shame. Does anyone have advice about how to cope? It sits inside me like poison and I just feel worse.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My best friend is a paranoid schizophrenic. He's been getting worse the last few months. His psychiatrist doesn't care. He's on meds that make him a completely different person. He's not lucid. His psychiatrist doesn't give a single shit. His dosages are all sorts of crazy. He's feeling anxious? Take him off his schizophrenia meds, add anti anxiety. Oh, now he's paranoid and sleeping in a park? Just let the anxiety meds work.

Thank you for showing compassion to your patient. Schizophrenia is a horrible disease.  </TEXT>
