	<TEXT> Firstly, no that isn't the case at all sweetie. My master's degree is in Special Education, which I realize doesn't seem relevant but if you'll look into it further you will see that in the educator BA and Me.d. Path, there are a lot of child psychology and childhood development courses. 

Secondly, I'm 30, so please keep calling me kiddo, it makes me feel gloriously young. ;)

Thirdly, if you had come to this conversation saying, "getting divorced under any circumstances is worse for the children and here is why:" and provided actual academic sources where real numbers had been crunched, I would have taken you more seriously. To just respond with "well my parents split and I'm fussy over it" is a poor and fallacy-filled argument. 

http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6925236

This^ article basically sums it up, but if you would like peer-reviewed academic sources, I'd be happy to link you. Just let me know if you will be able to access them with your college login since, unfortunately, they are not yet free to the public (something I am petitioning to change). </TEXT>

And just because your parents split doesn't mean you know what outcome would have been best. The best home for children is a happy one. Whether  that is happier apart or together depends on OPs home environment.

	<TITLE> Question about what sort of jobs I can get with current "certification" [Texas] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-25 16:34:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm in an alternative teaching certification program. I finished all the classes I needed to take and I am now, two classes away from a Me.d. In Special Education. I passed my Special Education Texes EC-12 test. My BA was in English. I've been a substitute teacher for four years. 

The way the program I am in works, is that you can either do a semester of student teaching (no pay) or do a year of teaching under a temporary license and get paid. Once you start getting paid (whether it is after the student teaching or during the temporary teaching) the program takes a percentage of your pay to cover the cost of the alternative teaching program. I can't afford to work for free for a year so I am going for the temporary license with pay. 

After I passed my sped texes test, I called my program so I could take the English Language Arts and Reading 7-12, and they said they would not green-light me to take that test until I finished paying them back. This means I have to get hired somewhere with only my Sped EC-12 cert. they also said I had a year after I was hired to take the PPR.

What sort of jobs can I expect to be hired for, with just the Sped EC-12? I can handle teaching anything for a year, but my ideal job was to be an inclusion teacher in an English class, but one of my friends told me It was unlikely for me to get hired for that position without an additional English or Generalist cert. he didn't say it was impossible though. Would my BA in English be taken into consideration? Looking for more light to be shed on this confusing process.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm also 29. I have a seven year old, about to be eight. Love her to death but she's a hurricane. I also have three jobs which amount to about 35-45 hours a week and I'm also in graduate school. I don't have your commute though and my work doesn't call me outside of work hours.

Basically, I feel you dude. It is hard. If you feel more exhausted than you think you should be, maybe get your thyroid checked? Still, it sounds like you should be tired from all you do. That seems natural because you are doing so much.

It sounds silly but I schedule my free time. It takes away from the idea that there is something I should be doing. Rest is a part of my mental health and although I have to remind myself of that often and loudly, it helps.

People aren't supposed to live like this, but we do because it is the world we live in. Part of that involves forgiving yourself for leaving some dishes in the sink or some laundry in the dryer. 

Remember, June cleaver didn't have a career. Even stay at home mothers have it tough. Don't let perfect looking people fool you, most of us are barely keeping it together. It sucks. I don't know if knowing you aren't alone helps, but I just wanted to reassure you.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to Change my child's last name with absent father. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-22 04:39:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I got pregnant at 20 and asked my boyfriend at the time if he wanted to take off or help me raise the child. He was adamant that he wanted to keep the baby and help me raise it. I wanted to keep the baby too but I gave him plenty of opportunities to 'get out' and have me raise her alone. I offered to claim I didn't know who the father was and raise her completely separate of him. He insisted he wanted to be a dad.

After she was born and he was on her birth certificate,  he proposed and we got married a few weeks later. Six months after that he decided raising a child was "not for him" and proceeded to move 1,000 miles away without notice.

I raised her for three years alone and never filed for child support. Then I lost my job and had to file for food stamps and they forced me to file for child support in order to receive government assistance. I filed for the minimum I could get (120$ a month) and in the following five years, have received a total of about 500$ from him as he couch surfed, and travelled the world in a drug induced haze. 

I have heard from him maybe five times in as many years and for the past five, my daughter has known my live-in boyfriend (soon to be husband)  as her father. She knows he is not her bio-dad but she considers him her dad. 

We are getting married and I'm changing my name to my fianc's last name. My daughter has expressed a very strong want to also have the same last name. Currently I have my maiden name and my daughter has my ex husband's name.  don't know what I can do without his consent or where to start. 

When my ex husband abandoned us, he told me "don't let her change her last name" as some of his parting words. I have no clue why he cared but I know if he knew, it would piss him off. Still I've tried to contact him and I can never find him when I want to, I only hear from him when he wants to contact me.

Not sure where to begin. Advice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my case, their writer who wrote these fluff/smut novels started getting slightly popular. They might realize her name is worth more than her actual books. After all, have you ever enjoyed a book and looked for a new one by the same writer? That's what they banked on. So they hired a few ghost writers to write under her name so the books would sell due to her notoriety. Now, 'She' is putting out more than the average writer could to capitalize on the name recognition. 

Some companies invent an author all-together and hope if enough books under that one name get put out, one of them will catch and spur sales for the others.

Or, like my self-help book, they make one with a similar title and similar sounding author name to another self help book that is super popular and hope people will buy the knock-off by mistake. (I want to stress I never read the actual book that my book was knocking off. They just gave me a title and subject and told me to write about it in a self-help style.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a ghost-writer for three books.

One is romance and one is a self help book and one is a series of romance short stories. I don't actually like writing romance all that much, but it sells so that's what they pay me to write.

None of them are over 70,000 words. It's a little hard but you don't have any of the added pressure of needing to be original or creative because your name isn't going on it anyway.the pay is shit. A 70,000 word book usually nets me about $1,000 but plenty of ghost writers make more. 

I do it as a side gig. I suppose one could argue that it is not worth it but I love writing and getting paid to write makes me happy. I also write my own books in my spare time but nothing has been published yet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hun, they *have* chimed in. I linked you to the official Texas teacher's pay scale. It is a standard set by the state. I don't know what more I can do to convince you. I currently live in El Paso and it's the same here even though the cost of living is lower because it's the same state. El Paso is broke as hell. They pay teachers 45K starting, because they HAVE to as mandated by the state and teachers unions. 

As for the wash out rate, yes. Being a teacher is a LOT of work and many quit because it is often times, a thankless and difficult job with tons of bureaucracy that gets in the way of teachers actually teaching. 45k a year often feels like it is not enough to make up for all the bullshit. It's not because they make less than 45k a year, it's because most teachers get into teaching to actually teach and the system makes it a hard and frustrating process that eats away at you. 

I originally started the certification process in New Mexico but transferred to Texas because the state mandated pay is nearly 10k less in New Mexico. Texas HAS to pay a full time starting teacher the listed price. </TEXT>

Also, the other person you are arguing with is correct, the standard pay is pretty much set for a first year teacher, despite what you have been told. A quick google will show that.

You also don't get paid extra to coach. They count as classes. If a teacher teaches 6-8 classes a year, part of those will be listed as "football" or "basketball". At least, where I'm from.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My boyfriend is a veteran. We are moving to a suburb of Austin in July and he is going to buy a house.

One of the reasons we are not married yet is because we figured it would be easier for him to buy a house since his credit is 673 and mine is terrible (around 520).

Our combined income is higher if he includes me in the loan but his credit score is much higher without mine factored in. Not sure what to do. He is retiring as an e6 and going to school and I'll be starting work as a teacher. 

I just finished school and he was paying the majority of the bills and now we are switching so I worry he won't be able to get a home loan when his retirement is so low even though I'll be contributing a lot more. 

Does anyone know how these veteran home loans work? I worry if I ask a banker these questions they will think I'm trying to scam the system. I'm sorry I'm so ignorant about this sort of thing.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should I mention my dyslexia at a job interview to become a Special Education teacher? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-14 21:31:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Typing from my phone so please excuse any formatting errors.

So, Hear me out:

My husband says I should not mention my dyslexia at an interview to become a Special Education teacher because he thinks it will make me less likely to be hired. I am not too sure though. 

See, I didn't learn to read until about 3rd-4th grade. I was diagnosed with severe dyslexia, and elementary school was an utter nightmare for me. After long hours with my mother and teachers, we worked day and night to make a breakthrough. We did it. Ever since then I've wanted to help kids make that same breakthrough. 

I went on to get my BA in English, publish three books, and I got my master's degree in Special Education. My need to excel in English, despite my dyslexia, was my driving force and the driving force behind wanting to help others with learning disabilities. 

I feel like if they look at my resume, they will see I'm not an idiot. I don't think telling them this story will make them worried that I will be unable to teach. I feel like it is an asset. I understand how those kids feel. I know the struggle first hand. Still, my husband insists it will put me at a disadvantage.

	<TEXT> Let's (and, please be sure, it is let's as in, contraction from let-us, unlike how your infant brain says it) look at this with real, adult logic. 

I AM correct and in with what I consider to be a child. Because, hell, if a baby has found a way to comment on the internet, might as well point out all the ways he/she is wrong, (and you are, sweetie, you are.)

For a baby, I must say, "Holy shit! I am impressed with your ability to use language!" other than that, no. Just because someone is a baby does not mean their opinion should be taken into consideration. After all, if it were up to infants like you, the world would be made up on tits and naps! Fun! *roll*

Anyway, I'm rational because you are blasting your infant opinion, for all to hear. I am merely saying "Hey! Everyone should know this person is an infant!" in order to provide people with the infantile basis behind your message. No worries, we get it. Boobs and diapers yes! Toilets and logic, no! Your point has been heard. 

Yeah, I'm 29. Let's see if you have the balls (or lady nuts) to tell me your age. Otherwise, I'm arguing with an infant who won't tell me his/her age. Who's the coward? The one who won't be transparent or me? Well... I can't possibly expect you to pick, after all, isn't it your nap time? </TEXT>

BTW, I don't have "children" so that shows how much you were paying attention. Good  to know I should have stayed in an abusive, drug-infested, poor environment because having a magic marriage certificate would mean they got all the benefits of a "healthy" "good" marriage. 

Because as long as you have that magic certificate, your children will grow up to be doctors and lawyers with no student debt and no asthma and no headaches, and watching  mom get nearly beat to death will mean nothing because their parents are "married!" 

Oh gosh! Sign me up! *vomit*

For a proponent of domestic violence, it sure feels like you've never seen any of it's effects. Either you are a child or have the mental capacity of one. Good luck with that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, I applaud your use of sources. Really, even though I disagree with you, bravo. No sarcasm.

Secondly, what you said earlier "good for you not everyone wants to doom their kids..." is what got me riled up. 

Your sources are good. I'm sure that this is the case with many divorces. Still, they are comparing rates of kids who's parents got divorced with, what I assume, are kids in happy two parent households. There doesn't seem to be evidence comparing kids who's parents are divorced and those who's parents are in a toxic marriage and refuse to get divorced "for the kids". 

I got mad at your "good for you" because my divorced was caused by my partner being abusive (among many other things like him cheating, refusing to get a job, becoming addicted to drugs etc.) it gave me the impression that you thought I said "my marriage is good but fuck it, I don't want to cheat so I'll get divorced and fuck the consequences  for my child!" That Is not the case at all. Don't you think in many cases of divorce, the parents weighed the pros and cons and saw divorce as the more healthy option? I know I did. 

Anyway, good sources, but they compare kids from normal two parent households with kids of divorce, not kids of divorce to toxic, two parent households that are at risk of divorce.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If she is on the pill and refuses to compromise and switch to another birth control then it is another instance of no compromise and a sign of a toxic relationship. You need to learn to look beyond the symptoms to the root of the problem.

Sure everyone cares what people think but if they put other people's thoughts above their own happiness then they care too much. 

They don't make you happy 99% of the time. This illusion of a perfect marriage with no sex is non existent. Once again you are looking at symptoms instead of the root of the problem. No sex is a symptom of a relationship rotting from the inside.

Divorcing because of "no sex" is better than divorcing because of infidelity. Also, once again, no sex is the symptom, not the real issue. I can't say what the real issue might be but It could be a plethora of huge issues. Lost love. Hate. Loss of respect. Irreconcilable differences. Maybe she's cheating. Selfishness. No will to compromise. These are what causes the symptom of no sex. Not having sex doesn't magically happen for no reason.

In the case of the sick spouse, neither is obviously preferable. Still, remember that thing I've said many times now? How no sex is a symptom of a bigger issue? Like lost love or no respect for the other spouse? That's not the case here. In this case it's a symptom of the illness. In this case a good husband would stand by his wife and not cheat or leave her. That's the only option. Any other way you roll it, he's a shit head and the behavior is inexcusable. He can jack off and carry on loving his wife in other ways than sex. If it really is just the illness, then he can get his emotional needs filled with his wife and fill his sexual need with his hand. Not having sex won't kill him. Leaving his wife or cheating on her, might kill her. I think most people who cheat are not having their emotional needs met because they are in a toxic relationship, not just because of sex. With an illness that would not be the case so he would have no need to cheat. He could love his wife and have her love him back and then jack off later.

Having a sick spouse who can't have sex is a shitty situation any way you roll it. Im sure it is miserable. Still, you don't make a shitty situation shittier by cheating on your spouse who could be dying. Sometimes we are dealt a hard hand of cards. It's up to us to be the best person we can be by playing them the right way. The only control you have is by doing what is right even if it's hard. There is never, NEVER a good excuse for cheating.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to post In that sub. I am divorced and we have a kid. I stand by my statement.

If an illness is involved than, shame on the husband even more for cheating. He should go jack off and get his priorities in check. 

Who the fuck cares what people think. If you are miserable enough to cheat behind closed doors, then end the relationship and go meet someone who makes you happy. It's your life, stop wasting it in a toxic marriage. 

Think about this, if he cheats and gets caught then suddenly he is seen as the "bad guy" and the divorce is "all his fault" and the wife has even more leverage in court to take half his stuff because he cheated, even if he thinks she drove him to it. 

And is leaving a sick spouse really considered worse than fucking someone behind a sick spouses back? Honestly if illness were the hypothetical reason then he has a lot more to be worried about then getting his dick wet. I'm not saying it's an easy decision. It isn't. It's the right one though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. Destruction . That option. Having a spouse who will not compromise or take the others's wants and feelings into consideration means the relationship is already doomed. Forcing kids to live in a toxic environment where their parents are together is worse than raising them with happy divorced parents. Yes, destroy the current situation, by all means. 100%

You might be imagining this super happy nuclear family where everything is perfect and their only issue is that the wife won't put out or compromise on anything, and the husband cheats. I can almost guarantee that's not the case.

A wife who says "I'm not changing, it's your problem" is already demonstrating being negative and uncaring towards her partner. Chances are their hypothetical home life is a shit-show and the kids are miserable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed, morally wrong and none of OPs business. 

 Cheating is 100% unacceptable in my book. If OP's customer and his wife agreed that they were going to be in a committed monogamous relationship, then that's what he has to abide by. If he feels the need to cheat, he should leave her or tell her that because they never have sex, he wants to cheat and either change the terms of their relationship or spur her to action. 

If you agree to monogamy, then violating that is a violation of trust and no good relationship can exist without trust. There is never a good reason to cheat, only a good reason to break up or open a dialogue. 

It is not 100%, but most of the time, no sex can be a symptom of a bigger issue. If the issues are causing their relationship to go toxic then it's healthier for these hypothetical children to grow up with two divorced, happy parents, than in a toxic environment where their parents are still together. There is no good reason to cheat.

"But she withholds sex." "But he works all the time" "but he/she is emotionally unavailable" "but he/she is abusive!" "But we've fallen out of love!" I don't care. Then break up. 

Breaking up demolishes a relationship in one blast. Deception demolishes it over a long period of time. Better to shoot the horse than torture it to death. 

I still agree that OP is being a shitty business owner (or employee) and it's none of his business.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Made false claims to CPS that resulted in getting my child taken away for seven months. 

Basically we lived together for six months and she never cleaned or looked after herself. I was a single mom and she was about five years older than me and sold it to me like "let's live together and I'll help you out."

She did not help me out. She treated me like her mom and I had to clean up after her lazy ass 24/7 and pay her half of the bills numerous times.

In the six months we lived together I asked her to pick up my kid from daycare twice, because I was working late, because we were low on money because she wouldn't pull her weight and I was preventing utilities from being shut off. After the second time she went on a big rant about me "abusing our friendship" so I never asked again. After that she started telling people my baby was her's and when confronted, sighted these two instances as reasons why she had a right to say that.

Then she got a dog. I love dogs but she was too lazy to take it out to eliminate. I did it when I was home but every day when I'd get back from work there was some fresh hell for me to clean up. I had to. If I didn't, my toddler would have been  crawling around in feces and dog urine. It was disgusting. 

So I gave her an ultimatum of cleaning up her own mess, taking care of her own dog, and paying her own half of the bills, or I'd move out. She told me to go ahead and leave. Our lease was for a year, and it had been six months, so as compensation I even paid her for an entire month after I moved out to have time to move herself, or find a new roommate.

I guess she was pissed. At this point we were still "friends" though it was hanging by a shoe-string. I moved and my new apartment had a malfunctioning water heater that burned my child. My kid ended up in the hospital and I called her to cry about it because I thought she cared about my baby too. Aside from everything, she seemed fond of my kid. I guess after the call, she hung up and  called CPS and made up lies about me intentionally burning my kid when I was angry.

That was the worst seven months of my life. They told me it would take roughly 18 months to get her back, but after CPS realized I was a good mom, and the claims were unfounded, they sped the process up as much as possible. The first few months before they believed me though, they were thinking about putting my kid up for adoption. I came so close to suicide so many times during those days. I still have nightmares. It was five years ago and my daughter is now seven and the top of her class. I'm glad I never killed myself and decided to fight instead. I have residual anxiety, depression and PTSD that still lingers from it. 

I don't think I can ever forgive her but I also can't stop blaming myself for leaving the water heater door open. If I ever ran into her again, the only think that would stop me from physically attacking her would be the fear of getting my kid taken away again or knowing I couldn't raise my child from prison. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very beautifully written. It was quite touching. I choked up reading it. I think it is a bit of an over-simplification though. I'm glad the bother in the story is doing well now, but as someone who has struggled through multiple traumas and addiction, sometimes it is not always as easy as talking and listening. It is certainly a start though. Talking about trauma has always been a big part of the way I and my family deal with things. I am sure things would have been much worse for me if we had never talked about our issues. Still, talking isn't a magic bullet. I wanted to know more about the brother's return to normalcy. The ending is so abrupt that it makes it sound like he changed overnight. 

Still a great piece.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We got two ferrets a month ago. One was about 1/3rd bigger than the other. I asked if they were sure both were boys, and they said yes so we thought maybe one was younger than the other.

Later we looked at their marshal birth certificates and the gender was not marked but the registration numbers were only one digit apart from the other and their birth date was listed on the same day so I figured they might be siblings. 

We've had them a month now and the white one is now twice as large as the darker one (pictured). I was playing with both today and noticed the white one had a little nib on his tummy and that it gets wet when he pees so I figured it was his man-junk. I checked the darker smaller one for a nub and could not find one. I then compared their lower areas and the big one just as a butthole but the smaller one has this (pictured). 

They both have the two dots tattooed on their ears so I know that means they both should be fixed. 

This one is a girl isn't it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you wanting advice on how to behave in jail or are you wanting DUI advice? I've been to jail but not for a DUI.

Be nice. Don't start shit with people to "assert dominance". Keep you head down. Don't talk to crazy people. There are a lot of crazy people in jail. Not "silly" crazy, clinically insane, talking to yourself crazy.

The food is horrible. Your biggest problem will be boredom. If you can, I'd hang out with calm old ladies there. Nobody wants to fuck with ladies who are old enough to be their mothers or grandmothers.

The one I went to wasn't dangerous really. The biggest shock will be your loss of rights. The guards don't have to tell you the time of day. Literally, they kept the lights on at my jail 24/7 and I could only keep track of days/time by meals. They don't have to answer your questions and usually won't. They won't be nice to you. They will treat everyone like scum of the earth. The sooner you learn to accept you have no rights, the less trouble you will have because throwing a tantrum will just make things worse for you. They easily forget about people. Forget to take people to their court appointments and make them stay extra days. It doesn't happen often but more than you'd like. If you are on medication I hope you can live without it. Even if you need it, they don't care. Once again, you have no rights.

You will be SO BORED 45 days is going to feel like three months. I cried a lot. Everyone did. Have a good cry and use the time to do some soul searching and figure out why you are the kind of person who made this mistake.

If you eat all the food they give you, you will gain weight. Most jails don't let you exercise so unless you want to gain weight, be careful. In my experience I lost weight because the food is SO BAD. I think each meal they serve you is like 2,000 calories. 

Good luck. Keep your head down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am so sorry for your loss. I've lost someone to drunk driving too.

Your "advice" however, is completely unhelpful.  It's obviously OPs fault and she has shown remorse. I think you are not taking several factors into consideration and just coming off as cruel. 

Op did something reckless and stupid and the criminal justice system is going to punish her to the extreme. She deserves it. Your comments don't undo her drunk driving. It's not like she is on here saying "oh man it's bullshit, I was totally fine", you are just beating a dead horse at this point. 

Once again, sorry for your loss but if you are not here to give advice than I don't know why you bothered to comment.

I also hope you take this same stance which anyone who has ever texted and drove, because it's just as dangerous. No forgiveness for mistakes. No mercy. Amiright?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have hashimotos disease. In simple terms this means I am allergic to my own thyroid and have hypothyroid (low thyroid) as a result. When I want sixteen I was covered in hives for about six months before they figured out what was wrong with me. It's hell being a teenager with a skin condition that looks infectious.

Anyway, you have to ween onto thyroid meds. Several months on the meds and the hives were still all over me and I screamed at my doctor (being the itchy teenage girl I was) to bump my dose up NOW!!!. The idiot obliged. I blame myself more than him.

I went to school the next day with my new high dose of meds and around lunch, I started shaking uncontrollably. I went to the nurse and after many failed attempts to call my mom, the nurse agreed to let me walk home. I'm leaving school, and just as I got to the outside parking lot, I vomited so violently that I shit and pissed myself. Got home and took a bath and continued to shake and vomit for hours. It was an OD.

I ODed two more days in a row because when I called my doctor he told me synthetic thyroid can't do that to a person. After day three I started cutting my pills in half and the symptoms stopped immediately.

A google search these days (11 years later) tell me my doctor was full of shit.

Yes I eventually got my dosage leveled out and the hives are gone. I'm 29 now.

EDIT: the shaking was not muscle spasms, I felt like I was freezing to death. This was in El Paso Texas in the middle of summer and I felt like I was so cold I was going to die. In also actuality my fever was sky-high and my body was desperately trying to cool down. I shook so hard I was sore for a week. </TEXT>

"For thousands of years, however, it was quite a different story. While we tend to think of chocolate today in its solid form, for nine-tenths of its long history, chocolate was a drink  the first true chocolate bar as we now know it was not invented until 1839. In the thousands of years before that time, chocolate was seen as an invaluable, sacred, even magical beverage  a symbol of power, a privilege of warriors and the elite, and a satisfying tonic that was consumed daily and offered the sustenance needed to tackle virile challenges." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's hard to say. Does your mom just call you worthless without explanation, or does she say why she is angry at you when she is telling you these things? If there seems to be a general trend of what she is complaining about, you might want to work on that.

The thing is, they are family, not your roommates. Families are generally expected to act like a team and work together. Even if you are not making much of a mess she might expect you to help clean up or do extra chores even if the mess isn't yours because you are a member of the team. It might not be fair but that's what happens. If you move in with a roommate and split everything 50/50 then it's totally within your rights to only help out with things you directly contribute to. Most family members go above and beyond for family when needed though, because that is what family is for. Once again, I know it isn't fair but since you live there, you're the first one she is going to ask. If you mom was lazy and working you like a slave while she did nothing to contribute, it might be different. Still, with the little info I have now, that is my gut response. It's her house, so ultimately she makes the rules. It sucks 

Human beings are animals, even if we are the most developed and intelligent. You see it in nature all the time. Once the cubs get large enough to fend for themselves, the mamma tiger chases them out of the den with increasingly aggressive behavior. I'm over-simplifying and not all parents do it, but all I'm saying is there is a bit of biology involved and not just logic. Kids are meant to eventually move out. I love my parents but when I was a teenager, things got increasingly more unbearable for all of us until I couldn't take it and moved out as soon as possible. I know it sucks and it gets harder every year to move out In this economy. 

I'm just making guesses with the information you gave me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My friend is a High School English teacher and she is making glaring errors in her writing. How do I help without offending her? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I have a BA in English and am nearly done with my master's degree in Special Education. That being said, I have dyslexia and I'm typing this on a mobile, so there are bound to be mistakes. 

I'm a substitute teacher and I'm working on passing my content exam to become a high school, Special Education, English teacher. One of the teachers I sub for the most is one of my dearest friends, who is an English teacher also (though she teaches a regular English class). Her students love her. She goes the extra mile with her students and works to the bone to give them the best education she can. She's a great person.

Three days ago, she asked me to go over three essays she has written for graduate school and I said "sure no problem." Guys, I'm shocked. Sentence fragments are everywhere, combined with run-on sentences. There are no commas. The words 'they're', 'there' and 'their' are used interchangeably at random. She consistently uses 'than' and 'then' incorrectly. She changes tenses at random, the train of thought is completely off the tracks, and I'm left utterly confused at the end of every paragraph as to what point she was trying to make.

Some of these things are easy to fix if I could teach her but... Christ, how does one go about gently telling an English teacher that you'd like to teach them English? I want to help her, but in the professional world she outranks me. 

The issue is, she got her degree in Education with a brief focus on English (the subject she would teach), while I got my degree in English and went back later to take education classes. I realize the bigger issue here is "think of the children!!", however, I'm more concerned right now with getting her to agree to some private tutoring with me (free) without offending her or making her hate me.

	<TEXT> Additionally the "no god In school" argument (as fundamentalists like to call it) are actually rules that state a teacher or the school cannot preach their religion at your children or force them to take part in religious activities. 

Things it does not do:

1. Prevent clubs kids can voluntarily join based on their religion
2. Prevent kids from bringing bibles to school
3. Prevent kids from praying in school
4. Prevent kids from talking about their religion In school.
5. Prevent kids from learning about different religions from a cultural perspective. 

If I see one more post on Facebook about; 
"Why does God let school shootings happen?"
God: "I'm not allowed in schools"
I'm going to lose my fucking shit. 

Fundamentalists try and get good, normal christians to try and repeal this rule by making it sound like their kids are not allowed to read the Bible or pray In school. Trust me, if they ever did get those rules repealed and a non-Christian started preaching their religion to their "Christian" kids, their parents would be the first ones with torches and pitchforks calling for the principal's head.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Never saw any evidence of domestic violence but they fought like cats and dogs. LOUD.

They were directly below us and we got multiple threats of eviction because, for the longest time, people thought the fighting was coming from our apartment instead of theirs.

I don't know who was reporting us, but whoever did was mistaken, and the landlord didn't live on site to confirm where it was actually coming from. 

Nothing sounds like a bigger lie than insisting to your landlord that you and you boyfriend never fight.... because that's what anyone getting eviction threats would say.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had him for 3.5 years and I don't think any of my IRL friends fully grasp how much this little guy meant to me. 

It happened very suddenly. I cleaned his tank (100 percent water change) and a week later it was filthy and I couldn't understand why, but he was acting normal. I cleaned it again and it got dirtier even quicker. In a matter of three days. It is an 8 gallon tank with a working filter and heater.  

Still, he was acting normal. I cleaned it again. He seemed fine yesterday, and this morning. Then, my husband called me in the room this evening and asked if he looked funny. I went in to check, and my heart sank. He died less than ten min later. 

I don't know what I did wrong but the water stinks. Also all the plants died about a week before and I took them
Out. I don't know how I could have been so stupid as to have not thought that was a red flag. They had been dying steadily since I got them and I thought it was just because I was shitty with plants. 

I'm so sad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a friend in high school who was asexual. We went to different colleges and never really got together again, but he's on my Facebook and we've chatted online a few times through the years. A few years after high school he came out as gay. Then a few years ago he dated a few different girls. Now he's polyamorous and having more sex than anyone I know.

I don't judge. As far as I'm concerned, he was asexual when he said he was, gay when he said he was, strait when he said he was and bi when he said he was. Who am I to tell him what his sexuality is/was? When he came out as gay after saying he was asexual for so long, a lot of people called him a liar or said he was gay all along and hiding it (they got really confused when he started dating girls) but I always felt like it was none of my fucking business. Whatever he decided to tell me he was at the time, was what he was, end of story. He certainly never was inhibited by labels.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as her choosing her friends over you and being busy with school, it sounds to me like her priorities are in the right place. She doesn't need to change. You need to decide whether or not you can hang with the way things are, as is. If you can't then you need to break up with her. Please keep in mind though that being a smart girl who cares about her future and treats her friends right are positive traits. 

I know you don't want to hear this, and I want you to know I'm not marginalizing your feelings, but at your age, friends and an education *are* more important. Are there people who start dating at your age that stay together forever? Sure. But it is far more likely her friends (at least one or two of them) will last longer. It is also far more pressing that she do well in her AP classes  because the chances of her education effecting her entire life are MUCH higher than this relationship. You can't ask her (not that you are I'm just saying) to risk her future and friendships for you. The one thing that makes teenaged relationships last is if both parties are not selfish. I know your feelings are real and that you care about one another.

It's not wrong to be a *little* selfish at your age. It's totally normal. You are teenagers. If you are dead set on this working out though, you might. Need to take a hit in that area.
