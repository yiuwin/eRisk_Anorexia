	<TEXT> Veg head for 15 years currently trying to get back into heating meat here.
 
Canned soup is easy to eat. Chicken Noodle, or Potato with bacon, it hardly tastes like meat and its not "chewy"

Don't rush it. It takes time.

Best of luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I said in the title, I just got the call from Stony Brook that they want me to come in for an interview. They said it will consist of a math proficiency test, a reading comprehension test, and a group interview. I'm so excited and nervous at the same time. Has anyone else done an interview for nursing school and feel like sharing their wisdom? Also, a big thank you to all the beautiful people of r/studentnurse that helped me with my personal statement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there! I'm applying for an accelerated nursing program for second degree students and was wondering if anyone would mind reading over my personal statement and giving some constructive criticism? I would really appreciate it, I'm not sure if it's acceptable or not. It's still a work on progress. The promt is on the top, and the program asked for 3-5 pages.  Thanks in advance!!

	<TEXT> k_tea, you are correct, EDNOS instead of bulimia. For some reason I thought she mentioned binging. However, that does not make the situation any less serious, getting help is still very very necessary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bulimia Nervosa

from the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders


Diagnostic criteria for 307.51 Bulimia Nervosa


A.	Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:
(1)	Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances 
(2)	a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating) 

B.	Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced **vomiting**; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise. 

C.	The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, **at least twice a week for 3 months**. 
(I would not say I'm bulimic but I am known to puke up meals if I feel guilty about what I've eaten... say a few or more times a week.)

D.	**Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.** 
( know I'm on the thin size (think 120ish at 5'8) but every time I see myself in the mirror I feel like shit)
Your BMI is 18.2. Anything below 18.5 is concidered underweight. 

E.	The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of Anorexia Nervosa. 

Specify type:
Purging Type: during the current episode of Bulimia Nervosa, the person has regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas 

Nonpurging Type: during the current episode of Bulimia Nervosa, the person has used other inappropriate compensatory behaviors, such as fasting or excessive exercise, but has not regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas****

Please, please please get help. If you want you can pm me, I've had my share fair of trouble with this particular devil. If I'm being too pushy I apologize. This disorder is very hard to kick without help, and while your boyfriend IS a hugeeee ass, you have bigger problems right now. Don't minimalize it, or rationalize it away. It won't disappear unless you make it leave.

She is in the house now and so far my dog hasn't shown much interest. If he he hasn't bothered her yet he probably won't. So if he doesn't show any signs of aggression we will keep her the house, I don't want her getting out again.  </TEXT>
