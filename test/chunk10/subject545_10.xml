	<TEXT> The hydras represent her problems at work. You fix one, and another will spawn. They travel with her to and from work, since they are always stuck in her head.

The rising water is the constant feeling of being under pressure and that uncomfortable feeling when in the same spot for too long.

The background is set in outer space to symbolize the emptiness of the character and how detached from reality she is. 

The lilies are supposed to represent rebirth. Which if the character drowns in the water, she has hopes of becoming something new and pure. Unfortunately, Nymphaeaceae(water lilies) don't have the same symbolic meanings as lilies. So mistakes were made, just like my grammar in the title of this, heh. 

Edit: In case anyone is interested in the process of this illustration

	<TEXT> These things are horrible, seriously lol where is the effort? I always wanted Duelyst apparel and collectibles, but come on guys. These things are way overpriced for how they look...

The faction crests on their own are so stylish, but blow them up and slap them on a T-shirt? It's obnoxious and plain ugly. Make a simple black or white tee, and just put the crest in the middle or in this format, but larger.

The environments and the pixel army would be great posters, but blow them up and slap them on T-shirts? Whose idea was this? Cleaner designs go a long way. Duelyst has some amazing artwork, please utilize it better. Counterplay, you want easy money? Release some more faction pins! Some stickers, some posters, key chains, and better T-shirts. 

I would love to support them outside of just in-game purchases, maybe next time though. </TEXT>
