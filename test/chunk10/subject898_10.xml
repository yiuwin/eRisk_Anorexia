	<TEXT> I live in a pretty small Canadian city and have a small theatre that has one of its 10 screens generally play (Avant garde and art films) which very luckily was playing Moonlight pre-awards season. So maybe if this doesn't get a mainstream release, it would play in situations like Moonlight did for me since it's also A 24. I'd think this would get a pretty wide release though simply due to the star power on the screen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I highly highly recommend watching the chronological cut. You can find a download link on reddit, but I recently watched it and it made season 4 ten times better. I used to always hate it (in comparison to the other seasons, still good in general) but now I just find it slightly worse. But the pacing and structure is just so much better in the chronological cut.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think if you compare these two movies directly, Iron Man or maybe The Avengers is still the best comic book movie in the sense of capturing the feeling of reading comic books I find. I love The Dark Knight, but it's just a straight great movie. It definitely does not feel like a comic book movie, which some may argue makes it a better one, but that's why I think Iron Man is the better comic book movie but lesser film </TEXT>
