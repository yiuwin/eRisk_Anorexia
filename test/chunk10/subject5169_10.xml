	<TEXT> So I don't know if this is the normal thing that gets posted here but this is something that has always fascinated me and has implications way beyond spots. If anybody else is familiar with this and wanted to point me to new resources or start a discussion that would be awesome.

I was hoping to talk about the rivalry between Joe Lewis and Max Schmeling. If you're not aware these were two boxers who fought first in 1936 and 1938. But what interests me most is not the boxing, but more the historical implications of this fight and the types of people these two individuals are.

Here is the background as I believe it to be true (I could easily be wrong on some of these details, if somebody with more knowledge could correct me that would be appreciated).

Lets start with historical significance of these two fights and the boxing background. Joe Lewis was arguably the first black american athletic hero. He was also probably the most important black american athlete since Jack Johnson (another equally fascinating story if your interested). Joe Lewis's personality was NOT like Muhammad Ali. Joe Lewis was a soft-spoken, humble man who was first and foremost a sportsman. He wanted nothing to do with politics and controversy. His managing team had strict rules including he was never to be seen with a white woman. He also (although this was after his fights with Schmeling) would serve for the US in WW2, not in a combat capacity given his celebrity status.  This made him just about as marketable as a black man could be among white americans at the time.

By 1935 Joe Lewis was undefeated and looked poised for a shot at the heavyweight title, perhaps the most coveted position in sports at the time. Enter Max Schmeling, a German former heavyweight champion who only had the title quite briefly basically due to a technicality. Joe Lewis was heavily favored.

Now keep in mind the time frame. This is during the rise of the Nazi party. For this first fight, Lewis is so heavily favored Hitler puts a lot of effort to ensure that this fight isn't radio broadcast or covered in Germany at the time. This was Germany's best boxer and former heavy weight champion of the world. He was a national hero who was almost definitely going to get embarrassed by and "American negro."

Promoters play off political tension and build this as american might vs. fascist power. The fight takes place in yankee stadium in front of a sold out crowd. To everybody's surprise Schmeling pulls off the upset and knocks out Jow Lewis in the 12th round. Schmeling returns to Germany and national hero.

Now let's talk about this "evil Nazi" Schmeling. Max Schmeling and Joe Lewis never hated each other. What you mean this man American media built up as the Nazi Fascist didn't hate this black man? Nope, never. In fact, Joe Lewis and Max Schmeling were life long friends and kept frequent correspondence. Max Schmeling traveled from Germany to America at an old age for Lewis's funeral.

But who was this German Schmeling? Max Schmeling might be one of the most interesting men you haven't heard of. In private (obviously to avoid any trouble) Max Schmeling abhorred Nazi ideology. During the 1936 olympics, at great peril to himself, he famously refused an invitation to sit in the box with Hitler. Given his celebrity status (think Michael Phelps) he was maybe one of the only people at the time who could refuse an invitation from Hitler. Years after the war it was also revealed that he heroically hid two jewish boys in his house. Certainly not the "nazi puppet" American media portrayed him as.

back to boxing.

After Schmeling's victory many assumed that put him next in line to fight the heavy weight champion Jim Braddock. However that fight was given to Joe Lewis, who knocked out Jim Braddock. Now this is the part that I've always admired most about Joe Lewis (and something I feel a lot of athletes and people can learn from today). Joe Lewis refused the belt and title. Joe Lewis adamantly stated that he would not allow himself or anybody else to call him the heavyweight champion until he avenged his loss to Max Schmeling despite having technically won the title.

In the second fight Joe Lewis was able to knock out Max in the first round. sorry for that recap if you were already aware but let me talk about the points that interest me:

The politics around this fight - These were two people that favored themselves sportsmen, not political figures. Max meant so much for political Germany and the time and Joe meant so much for America and in particular Black America. But at the core, neither of these people wanted to be anything more than boxers.

The personal relationship - pretty hard to think of a more different background these two lifetime friends came from. And more over the circumstances they met, considering they met by essentially punching each other in the face. But these were two people that recognized they brought out the best in each other and that was what mattered most to them. To me this is what I consider the most amazing rivalry, not because it has the most animosity but for the exact opposite.


I never really post stuff and don't come to reddit too much so if I've broken any rules I apologize, this has just always been one of my favorite historical stories and any thing people want to add or whatever would be appreciated. Thanks guys! </TEXT>
