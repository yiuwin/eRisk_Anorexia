	<TEXT> Show me where I said this is a dog attack, I am aware the dog is playing.

I don't understand why you fail to fathom why teaching a dog to pull a human is a bad idea? 

If this dog is playing with a different child and happens to miss the foot and break skin on the ankle, what will the parent do?

The dog won't be taken to court and tried, it will be put down if reported. 

Stopping this behaviour stops mistakes like that happening.

	<TEXT> Pulling a toy and pulling a body part are two totally different aspects. 

My father was part of the dog unit in a local prison and he has trained many dogs. Playing with a dog with body parts is not good fun. It will end up with a dog biting someone by accident who doesn't expect it and cause problems. 

I'm laughing at the fact you think I don't care for animals, I have more compassion than you could ever imagine.  </TEXT>

My first question is was it done by an individual who is trying out their hacking skills and succeeding, someone inside the UK or another country.. I'm not too sure and this worries me greatly. I seem to have lost all trust from the government entirely.

Someone tell me they feel the same?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We just use gluten free pasta! 

Top ten meals 

Spinach   mushroom curry (coconut cream sauce) with rice 

Homemade bchamel sauce with gluten free pasta and whatever veg we have on hand

Peanut veg curry

Soups   chilies

Salads with whatever veg we have and then bulk it up with quinoa or lentils

Oats are really filling for breakfast (get the gluten free kind) 

We live in the UK so we get lots of the Linda McCartney vegan sausages and burgers (not all are gluten free but a few are)

Allllll the potatoes (sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, mashed, cut up like fries, steamed, cubed, etc)

We make grilled cheese with vegan cheese and gluten free bread (lots of gluten free breads do have egg in them though so make sure to double check) 

For breakfast my girlfriend also likes vegan yogurt with muesli

Yeah basically the staples of our diet are rice, pasta, potatoes, quinoa, lentils, any kind of beans, veg (frozen and fresh), coconut milk, tamari and nutritional yeast.
