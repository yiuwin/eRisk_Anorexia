	<TEXT> Thank you for this! I'm glad that were so lucky with your family.
Actually, this is what I later on also told my mum: she simply needs time and she's just overwhelmed at the moment. 
Also, a big part of the problem isn't really she herself but rather her side of the family. She said that they won't ever accept someone who's gay in their family and I'm 100% sure she's right about that. For them, the solution will most likely be to hide it. Do you think that's a good approach or should we do something else? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to help my mother cope with my sister coming out </TITLE>

	<TEXT> As I stated in the title, my 12-year old sister said today that she likes girls and not boys. And personally, I, well, don't really care. It doesn't change a bit what I think of her, I love her just as much as before and fully support her. I haven't yet talked too him about it, but I'm pretty sure my father thinks about this the same way and will also support her.
My mother on the other hand thinks differently. Other than may father, sister and me, who we all grew up in Germany, she is from Indonesia, where she lived until she was about 30 years old. Like most Indonesians, she grew up in a very traditional and muslim environment. So she didn't take the news terribly well. When she came to me to talk about it, her first thoughts were "What did I do wrong?" and "I'm a bad mother". Of course, I tried to console her and told her that she did nothing wrong and that we couldn't ever wish for a better mother. She then also tried to explain this happening by it being a "punishment from god for her leading a sinful life" (freely translated). Again, I said that this was definitively not the case and that there was absolutely nothing that she should feel even the slightest bit of guilt for. 
Now, I ask for your advice. It was clear to me that I couldn't change her views in just a few minutes, that it will take time for her to calmly grasp onto things. So how should we (my father, sister and me) handle this? I'm sure a lot of you have had the same or similar unfortunate experiences and would like to know what you did.
Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are explosive shells inside the bunker. When they're hit, like in this GIF, there's a huge explosion which often nets you a multikill. The thing is, they don't respawn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but those are just different examples. It doesn't change anything about the fact that you (and also right wing parties in Europe) love playing the role of the victim. Which is exactly what is being criticised in this comic. </TEXT>
