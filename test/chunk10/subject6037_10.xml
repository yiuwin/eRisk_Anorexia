sarah polley isn't directing?

I posted another link in r/aliasgrace. That article mentioned Polley wrote and produced the series. Maybe she intended to direct at one point but changed her mind. 

There's also an extended clip at the other link in the Alias Grace sub. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I searched this forum before posting my question. I found many references to syncing with a desktop or laptop and a portable device like a phone or tablet. There could be a difference when trying to use only the latter two.

How does your Fitbit device sync with your computer?

Before I install the Fitbit app on my phone I want to be sure it won't infer with the app already installed on my tablet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure if anyone from Fitbit, Inc. reads messages here. I've had my Charge 2 for two days. Here are some initial suggestions to improve the device:

Allow variable time setting for clock display (2 seconds is too short)

Allow for variable brightness

Have a timer (instead of the stopwatch?) to set for exercise times (e.g., set timer to go off after 10 minutes as I'm walking this every hour)

Allow "Reminders to Move" to have more variability. Instead of goals every hour with only one start and stop time how about intervals like, "Start 9:00 am, Stop 5:00 pm" then another, "Start 7:00 pm, Stop 10:00" pm.

Allow "Reminder to move" to have more options than 10 minutes before the hour 

Allow option to remove or turn off gamification/badges - this just doesn't interest me but I understand why other like it </TEXT>

Personally, I don't watch network shows cause they always take weird breaks. 

I think this is a very good point. It's very frustrating and disruptive. There are some shows that I've watched that have had breaks that are so long I've forgotten some of the details about key plot points.

In addition, one of the few successes recently on network television have been the anthology series that usually run about ten episodes or so. Although these cannot be binged at least they usually run all the episodes without a break.

So perhaps what is really "dead" is the notion of creating 22-24 episodes per season for each show on network television? </TEXT>

isn't this the case virtually every year? high casualty rate among new broadcast shows isn't a new trend

Agreed it is not. Teasing out the cause(s) is the real issue. 

Is it because the show wasn't any good? Was it cancelled too quickly (didn't have time to develop/work out the kinks)? Are there too many other sources of entertainment (e.g., streaming services)? Cord cutters didn't access these shows via cable subscription and thus weren't counted in the ratings? People are just overall watching less tv or is it possibly something else?

Until the networks figure this out it will likely continue as is. This is frustrating for both the viewer as they get attached to a new show and the network as I'm sure it's expensive to ramp up a new show rather than carry on with an existing one.

I'm guessing it's all these issues (and maybe more) that I've listed above. The network model is broken, the executives refuse to see this and adapt. One way would be to try to include illegal viewing in the ratings. 

If not viewers will end just up witnessing a slow and painful death.

	<TITLE> Fitbit app data transfer via Bluetooth or data plan? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-13 18:57:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Long story short - I do not have a data plan on my smartphone (iPhone 6) but I do use it with WiFi. 

I understand the Fitbit app synchronizes via Bluetooth. When exercising I will have my phone with me. 

If I want to keep track of my statistics using the Fitbit app can I pair it via Bluetooth on my iPhone? That is, will the data transfer via Bluetooth while I'm out with my iPhone and/or will it upload when I get home and am connected to my WiFi? 

Also do you have to open an account with Fitbit to use the app (are they tacking your usage even if you don't use their premium service?)? If Fitbit is tracking this then a data transfer would be necessary.

Edit to add: I just saw this post:

http://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/6atp70/can_fitbit_work_with_only_an_ipad/

I now think I can use the device the way I want but I'm leaving this post to clarify the issues about Bluetooth and opening an account with Fitbit. </TEXT>

http://www.bravo.ca/Shows/TheHandmaidsTale

It's really annoying that others already have access to the first three episodes. It now means I can't participate in online discussions for the entire run of the show as I will always be behind. 

The same thing happened with "The Good Fight". The first two episodes were released by CBS All Access whereas it aired in Canada on the W Network one episode per week. 

I'm glad we got to see it but don't these executives realize how many people participate in and enjoy discussing shows online with others? These staggered release schedules totally ruin this. </TEXT>

There were quite a few articles about how the other actors gave up some of their salary so that Mayim and Melissa would receive more money. But I don't recall reading anything official after that. 

I did a quick search (linked below) and it doesn't show anything conclusive. In fact, there are no new references to this issue since the initial statement was made.

Does anyone think Mayim might be leaving the show?

	<TEXT> The podcast is available at http://thewestwingweekly.com

There is also a discussion thread for each episode that seem quite popular. I haven't read the posts with regularity so I can't confirm whether they're spoiler free or not. If they are spoiler free it would be a great way for a first time viewer to really explore and enjoy the show. </TEXT>

If you start to really enjoy it, then once you're finished, I'd recommend you listen to the West Wing Weekly which goes into a lot of detail about how the series was made, from interviews with Sorkin and Schlamme, to the main cast and people in the crew, from wardrobers to cameramen.

I recommend this podcast as well. But given that there aren't any spoilers I would suggest that anyone new to the show listen now after they've watched each episode. They've just completed the first season. I would have loved to had this type of review available to me when I first watched it.

I read through that and there is no real explanation to the humor behind the joke

I don't think it's a joke per se. I think it's an allegory.

	<TEXT> I think season 1 came out in the beginning of 2015. Season 2 aired in the U.K. (and Europe?) in early 2017. That's a long time between seasons! Didn't the company involved in making it go under? I doubt there will be a season 3 regardless of how season 2 is received.

There's a sub for it (r/Foritude) but I wouldn't look if you want to avoid spoilers.

I thought season 1 was really good but there were some plot weaknesses. 

Season 2 is available on DVD in June in Canada. It wasn't on iTunes/Apple TV in Canada, which is how I saw season 1.

	<TEXT> Since October 1914, German troops had held their position at Vimy and had heavily fortified their lines. The British and the French made several attempts to take Vimy, which resulted in over 100,000 casualties.

The German troops suffered from increasingly heavy artillery bombardment that began on March 20, 1917 and continued for over three weeks. 

On April 9, 1917, supported by a creeping artillery barrage, four Canadian Divisions attacked Vimy Ridge. The troops moved uphill across difficult terrain. The advance went so well, the Canadians were able to overtake many German trenches before enemy soldiers could emerge from the shelter of their dugouts. 

It took three more days for the Canadians to capture the last objective, known as the Pimple. Despite the rapid progress, there were heavy troop casualties caused by German shellfire, snipers and bayonet fighting. 

The Battle of Vimy Ridge was a great tactical success, and signified Canadas coming of age as a nation.

Can you even imagine having to wade through that muck and mire, all while hoping you don't get shot, gassed, or shelled?  

I understand that one of a soldier's worse enemies is wet feet. The men in this photo chose stand in the mud to help push a truck, which I believe was likely neither their responsibility nor duty. Gotta give them props for that on top of the sacrifice they already made by serving in the war. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part of it may also be the way the character has been styled on the show. She has little, perhaps no makeup and wears much more simple clothes. 

I can't really speak to the quality of her acting. I don't know what else she's been in that I've seen. But I think as posted above she's certainly holding her own amongst two Academy Award winning actresses, namely Reese who she's had many scenes with and Nicole as well.
