	<TEXT> You are clearly judging yourself to harshly.  Most people are too concerned with what is going on in their lives to pick apart or analyze what you said to judge you.  They also don't think about it later or when they go home, they think about themselves, their friends, their loved ones.  Next time you feel stupid saying something, ask yourself if you would call someone else stupid for saying the same thing.  If not, then you should stand behind what you said.  You determined it was interesting/funny/whatever, so that should be good enough.  If you're afraid someone will make you feel stupid then you are giving power to your enemy.  Be you and accept that it's good enough because it's all you got and it has to be. </TEXT>
