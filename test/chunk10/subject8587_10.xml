	<TITLE> Help with Offerings, Pt 2 </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi everybody, I wanted to first thank everyone who answered my offering based questions last time around, you were all incredibly helpful. I'm sorry I couldn't respond to everyone, my academic life got hectic and I had to spend a great deal of energy getting things done. Still though, I've taken everything that was said into consideration.

Now to the questions I wanted to ask this time around.

Aside from making offerings of incense to Allat, today I've offered her a piece of pita bread that I partially burnt and placed before her. My question to all of you is what do I do with food offerings (in this case, a burnt piece of pita) after I present them to the gods? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone already mentioned, no, they weren't all black. Nubians were black. As for the second part of your post, that has to do with the Islamic conquest of Egypt during the 600's CE. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for replying, my good sir or madam.

I can see that I am being a bit too rigid here with offerings to her. I'll take your advice and the advice of everyone else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in an apartment style dorm and I don't have access to the ingredients to make the barley cakes because I'm broke.

But I get your and everyone else's point. It's the thought that counts </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, I'm relatively new to this sub and I have an important question/questions for anyone who's willing to answer me.

I worship the three gharaniq (Allat, Al-Uzza, and Manat), Marduk, and Nabu, though at the moment, I only have an idol dedicated to Allat. I do hope to eventually have idols for all of them in the future, but for now, I'm focusing on improving my current altar to Allat. 

What I mainly offer her is incense in the form of myrrh, which I try to light daily. I am aware that in the past, her loyal followers would make offerings of barley cakes, but I don't have the ability to offer that to her and I don't want offer anything else as a substitute, lest I offend her.

So the main gist of this is how I can improve my offerings to Allat and what kinds of offerings I can make in the future to my other gods? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Allat (I also call her by her other names, like Elat and Ilahatan) is quiet and reserved, but she always commands my attention. Every time I light some myrrh as an offering to her, I can't help but feel compelled to stop whatever else I'm doing and sit. She admonishes me to take a moment and appreciate the silence, the stillness, the calm that comes after the smoke starts wafting into the air.

With Nabu, while he doesn't always make himself know to me, he always seems to be hovering near, guiding me in my writing. He coaches me through my English assignments, aiding me during those arduous late night, desperate efforts to finish an essay. I owe him a lot of my success. </TEXT>
