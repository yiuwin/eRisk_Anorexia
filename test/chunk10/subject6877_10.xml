	<TEXT> If you're playing front row then I wholeheartedly suggest going  for 8 studs. Those extra two studs will give you so much more grip in the wet ground between November-March.  

Can't give any advice on the kind of boot but Stampede sounds like the kind of boot befitting a front three player. 

Obligitary reminder to tighten studs! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It might just be harmless. However from looking at his previous stories it appears than in reality he actually is completely ignorant of rugby outside of the southern hemisphere. At least he admits to not knowing anything about Gopperth, however if you don't then don't go making stupid parallels about the quality of the whole league on one player.  

Just had a look at his Twitter and it appears he has to cover a whole range of sports. Simply ignorant but his job is to create discussions kind of similar to this I guess.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a scrum half but will give some tips I seem to always hear from some decent coaches (academy standard.)  

1. Have a low centre of gravity when following the play and approaching the breakdown. Will make you a lot more explosive if the opportunity arises to break from the sides.   

2. Listen to your 10. So many young scrum halfs will completely ignore the calls from the 10 when there is a clear overlap and try and throw an outrageous dummy. Don't be that guy unless you are confident you can make a significant break.  

3. Don't always feel the need to spin the ball. If you're passing the ball to a forward pod or popping to a team member, sometimes a short fast pass can work and it is a lot easier for your team to catch. Master the art of the non spin pass before you consider these mad spinners.  

I will leave you with the one and only [Peter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiX-PyE7804) to help you along.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [His highlight reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKHy--CmaQw) from last year suggests he really is an exciting player for the Chiefs. I think it will all depend on how he plays when he EVENTUALLY gets a place for the All Blacks. Being a back three in New Zealand can be a curse due to the sheer depth they have. 

So in my opinion, yes he will make the All Blacks, but long term? I would say probably not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry to hear that mate.   

I will draw on one of my most cliche quotes to guide you through this.  

*A year from now everything that troubled you today will mean nothing to you.*  

Not sure if that reassures you or fills you with anxiety but I hope it helps. </TEXT>
