	<TEXT> Most of the time you're hit by a GB while the revenge animation is still playing and then hit by shoves and bashes and kicks over and over making you unable to move at all. The uninterruptable only works as long as the armor is up and doesn't stop blunt hits. I don't mean just leaving everyone or using a feat to win. I mean literally killing them with your moves. I haven't seen it happen in a 3 or 4 v 1 since the nerf. Like shit, even trying to do a zone, heavy, or dodge to bash someone down still gets you hit by a GB. You just get stuck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying it should be a win. It doesn't even give you a chance any more. You live 1 second longer, and that's it. All I am saying is you should get a chance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like its good how it is for 2v1. Like it evens it out so if you outplay them you can win. 3v1 or 4v1 is impossible because if all the interrupts from all directions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One change could be having the Revenge effects scale depending on how many are fighting you similar to how you gain it faster. For example (Just for example purposes, not saying this is good) 1v1 has no Revenge gained. 2v1 is Revenge buff normal, 100%. 3v1 is Revenge buff increased, 200%. 4v1 Revenge is even more buffed 400%. Coupled with changing how blunt (bash, shove) attacks affect Revengers it might be alright. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At least in more than 2v1, the nerf coupled with the new gear changes has made Revenge mode unviable when outnumbered. It really needs some sort of change, revert the nerf, or something new. It just doesn't make an impact except for living maybe 1 second longer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So what you're saying is if thrown into the wall at more of a distance the recovery is too slow to beat a charged heavy, which then leads to charged jab, right? From what I see all the complaints are that his jab tap hits into a wall again leading to heavy, jab, heavy, jab. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The visual distinction between them is charged looks like an uppercut, yes? This thread shows someone clearly dodging a jab after a confirmed regular heavy hit.

	<TEXT> By the way, charged heavy is NOT guaranteed after wall hit. A regular is, but not charged. It can be dodged. Also after a hit or blocked heavy, jab is not guaranteed either. It can be dodged. The only jab that is guaranteed is one after a pinning charged heavy hit.

Cent's moves seem to push people to dodge him rather than parry and block. </TEXT>
