	<TITLE> GCSE History Revision - some tips </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-19 09:19:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all,

Someone asked me to make a post about exam technique for GCSE History, so here goes.

The basic structure is:

I will use this question in examples: ' Was introducing the Rentenmark the most important reason for German recovery
in the years 192329?'

**intro**

short, one sentence, sets the scene. Doesn't need to be complicated. Short and snappy 'There were several reasons for German Recovery in the years 1928-29, including introducing the Rentenmark.' Remember, you don't get any marks for the introduction, so don't spend more than 30 seconds. on it.

**Developed Explanations**

The next thing you need are three developed explanations. You need to make your point with a signpost sentence, give specific factual detail, develop that detail, then explain importance and relate back to the question. This last bit is crucial - it is impossible to access level 3 unless you develop and make your point relevant to the question. Do this three times for top marks. 

**Conclusion**

Wrap up and sum up your points. Bring together to form an argument.

I'll add more a bit later, but I hope this helps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He is not. I've actually written a pretty in depth backstory for the dude.

Character backstory if it helps:

Raised in a monastery, lived there until age 15 when he left and joined the army. Was in the Army for 20 years. Lost lots of mates. Developed a bit of an addiction to some harmful drug (akin to skooma) after discharge after 20 years service. Went back to the monastery to get clean. Remained in monastery for 5 years, clean throughout. When his teacher died (Yoda figure), he relapsed. Was thrown out of the order as a consequence.

He is skilled in alchemy and healing though. For the first lump of the campaign he actually didn't do much healing, because I was trying to play him like a fighter.

I'd like some advice.

I have a friend who used to be a christian, but since coming out as Bi she is convinced she is going to hell.

It's a similar story with my trans friend, who won't even entertain the idea of getting involved with christianity because she claims that being trans is a sin according to it and he can't change who he is.

What gives?

Any thoughts, advice or prayers would be greatly apprieciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The church of England has been going for at least 500 years. I sincerely doubt it will die out.

I am assuming that you are a Catholic, apologies if i am wrong, but what do you feel about me being just a generic Christian? I don't identify with any one denomination, because no one denomination matches my beliefs. I believe in the holy trinity, that Jesus died on good Friday, was buried and rose again on the third day. The apostle's creed pretty well sums up my beliefs.

But i don't like Catholicism because I find the service boring. It just isn't fun to me. I prefer non denominational churches because they make the service upbeat, lively and has a sermon which is above all really interesting and relevant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm. It certainly appears to be well established in the UK, and i can certainly say that chiropractic treatment has done me a lot of good.

I have no background in the field scientifically, but i have had issues with my musculoskeletal system which has been successfully fixed through chiropractic treatment. I find it difficult to believe that the successes of all that treatment is simply down to the placebo effect.

The problem with chiropractic treatment in the US is that it is incredibly unregulated. In the UK, chiropractors have to be properly qualified and are well respected healthcare professionals.

I find it helps to fix problems caused through playing impact sports such as judo and rugby, which cause misalignments in the spine.

EDIT: obviously, it's not going to work to fix complex problems like cancer, the side of it that puts all illnesses down to problems of subluxation in the spine is frankly ludicrous. Like with herbal remedies, it works to fix a very specific set of issues. Chiropractic works to fix spine problems, like lavender oil can be used to help you sleep. But neither treatment is going to cure cancer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah... No.

It is certainly a proper science and medical treatment method. A variety of issues all over the body can be put down to issues with the spine and it's alignment.

It the UK, it is not uncommon for a patient to be referred to a chiropractic practitioner. Here, it is extremely well regulated and you have to have a degree in the field in order to practise.

You go to your chiropractor for musculoskeletal issues, not frikkin'cancer.

Hope this clears it up. Have a browse on here - https://www.mctimoney-chiropractic.org - if you are curious. There are also numerous success stories all over YouTube. </TEXT>

I think that the dog hadn't really had much contact within the shelter, and there hadn't been much in the way of efforts to properly socialise him.

Happy ending though, I recently heard that that dog had been adopted out, to a farmer who was going to use him for the job he'd been bred for - as a gun dog. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Christian checking in.

I agree that there are plenty of conservative (small c) religious people who are against anything which goes against the status quo and as such dislike anything which meddles with genetics and that sort of thing. Those people are holding society back. Those people are standing in the way of meaningful progress which can benefit all of humanity.

But on the other hand, there are loads of progressive Christians who desire to see progress made. Who feel that improving people's lives is doing God's work. And not just Christians in this regard.

I just don't think you should be taring all Christians with the same brush. Same goes for all the other religions. 

Just my two cents. </TEXT>

Your parents can't let him into your house when really, they're on the outside and they don't have a key, nor can they break the door down. You have to open the door to Jesus from the inside. </TEXT>

I think we can assume that India would demand full independence. The other commonwealth realms which currently recognise the Queen as their head of state would probably be quite easily convinced to be part of an imperial federation.

Perhaps even the Irish would get in on this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It can be argued that the Nuclear Bomb - the most destructive bomb known to man - has been the key reason for the long period of relative peace which the World has enjoyed since 1945.

Without the nuclear bomb being invented, a land invasion of Japan would almost certainly have taken place. This may have seen British, US and Soviet troops fighting on the same front, side by side, fighting for the same objective.

This might have created a humanisation between them, possibly even friendship. The lack of a common enemy had not vanished, and one could anticipate that the war in Japan continues well into 1946, possibly even into 1947, with in excess of a million allied casualties.

Moving back to your question, if the Soviets, UK and USA end up cooperating even more on the Japanese front, I think that tensions do not build up as quickly. Lets remember that there still would have been an arms race of some kind - possibly research into more powerful conventional bombs - but this arms race would have been restricted to conventional warfare.

I expect that there would have been a shooting clash over Berlin at some point down the line. </TEXT>

What if this didn't happen? What if Finland saw the USSR as a continuing threat to it's independence and decides to join NATO as a result?

How does the USSR react? How does this affect international relations for the remainder of the Cold War? </TEXT>

I was really good at maths in secondary school, enough to get me into a scheme which gets me some money through Uni and a place at one of the top sixth forms in the country.

Maths is a pain now, I spend the first 15 minutes of a maths lesson being really confused, and when I do get it, needing to practice a helluva lot.

I'm aiming for a B in physics, politics and Maths so I can read mechanical engineering at Uni. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up though. </TEXT>
