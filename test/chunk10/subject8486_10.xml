	<TEXT> I was not aware of how the modern techniques of propaganda were really put to initial use by the Wilson Administration, which faced the need of mobilizing the public to support a war that many Americans had wanted to stay out of.  A historian of journalism from Boston University looks at how journalists were pressured to stay loyal, and swamped with press releases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's pretty worn away, but the bottom line looks like a name, Herz Lefek.  The upper lines are probably yiddish (which I don't read); they have a lot of the letters ayin and aleph, which are common in Yiddish to help represent the German-based sounds, but aren't very common in this way in Hebrew.  At the very bottom I can read the Hebrew letters nun-tzadik-fay, which is part of an initialism for the Hebrew phrase [May his soul be bound up in eternal life](http://jewishliteracy.blogspot.com/2010/06/matzevah-unveiling-of-tombstone.html). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With the formation of those first hydrogen atoms  each made of one negatively charged electron and one positively charged proton  the universe entered a period cosmologists call the Dark Ages. During this time, the universe quietly waited for clouds of hydrogen to obey the influence of gravity and collapse into the very first stars and galaxies. The ignition of the first stars marks the end of the Dark Ages and the beginning of our Cosmic Dawn, some 100 million years after the Big Bang. </TEXT>

 drew on the publicly available American Time Use Survey.This is an annual effort of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics querying around 10,000 people every year on their daily schedule of activities. We pulled out all activities involving watching television and video, and grouped the US population according to their watching patterns.

The results were, to us, shocking. The differences are enormous. Dividing the population into heavy, light, and in-between groups:

* The heavy-watchers group is 14% of the population and watches television 7.7 hours day.
* The light watchers are 54% of the population and watches 1.1 hours a day.
* The in-between group is 33% of the population and watches 3.5 hours.

And those heavy watchers contribute mightily to climate emissions from electricity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Discovered more than 30 years ago in soil samples from the Polynesian island of Rapa Nui, rapamcyin is perhaps the leading contender in the race for the first anti-aging drug.

It is already FDA-approved for use as an immune suppressant that reduces organ rejection in kidney transplants. It is also used to treat certain cancers, since it can stop cells from growing.

In 2009, researchers made another observation about this versatile drug: when fed to mice at the equivalent age in humans of 60 years, it gave them a boost in life expectancy  an impressive 38% in female mice and 28% in male mice. It has also been proven to extend lifespan in yeast, worms and fruit flies. </TEXT>

If the Wampanoag don't agree, then the state will give a license to someone else to build a competing casino nearby, which would split the market and probably make the Wampanoag get less money than signing an agreement with the state.

But I think the Wampanoag are playing hardball negotiating by trying to scare away any possible competitors. </TEXT>

Like Trump, he came to politics from the corporate world and an office in Manhattan. And also like Trump, Willkie came to national prominence through his skillful use of the national media.

Also:
Widely covered in the press, Willkie came across as a common-sense critic of the New Deal as something that could and sometimes did go too far.

Next came a triumph in the broadcast entertainment media, in another parallel to Donald Trumps role on his Apprentice TV show.

	<TEXT>  Back in 1880, Charles Darwin showed that when you grow plants along a slanted surface, the roots dont grow straight away from the seed, but rather take a jog to one side. This root growth strategy is called skewing. Darwin hypothesized that a combination of gravity and the root touching its way across the surface was behind it - and for 130 years, thats what everyone else thought too.

 
 But in 2010, we saw that the roots of the plants we grew on the ISS marched across the surface of their Petri plate in a perfect example of root skewing  no gravity required. It was quite a surprise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In the brain, reading music is a widespread, multi-modal activity, meaning that many different areas of the brain are involved at the same time.... While text and music reading share some networks, they are largely independent.

And:
Differences in reading ability can occur even within musical notation. Cases have been reported where musicians have lost their ability to read pitch, but retained their ability to read rhythm, and vice versa. fMRI studies have confirmed that the brain processes pitch (spatial information) and rhythm (symbol recognition) differently.

	<TEXT> ### submission statement
Last week satellite pictures confirmed that the Islamic State had razed to the ground Iraqs oldest Christian monastery, Saint Elijah, outside the city of Mosul.

The University of South Florida and other researchers are using 3D-imaging technology -- including laser scanners -- to recreate the monastery, and preserve other priceless sites and artifacts, and even share them more widely with the world.
