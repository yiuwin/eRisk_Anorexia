	<TEXT> The mountain hunters are looking for the enemy where is it and they ( mountain hunters ) inform the superiors about the situation. From what my grandmother and my mother said: they are kind of snipers sometimes but when the enemy comes, mountain hunters have to fight like body to body. It's kind of strange but it's hard to be something like that because you need some patience. Hope you understand bro! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I posted up but I will paste it:
 My great grandfather fought in ww2 and he died in 1986 unfrotunately, but I havent known him because I was born like 15 yrs after he died, but my mom said about him a lot of good things, and she said that my great grandfather was very kind with others. When he ( ggf ) got high fever, he started to tell about the war, like how the russians treated him and stuff like that. He was a prisoner in a camp named Celabinski or something like that in Russia and he said that he survived after he drunk water of the dead bodies and he came with a train for animals. P.S: His brother died when he was 18 yrs old in Russia or Ukraine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand man! Even if he was a nazi I can't judge them becuase as a soldier you serve the regime and you have no choice... because many soldiers were against the regime and they were assassinated or killed etc. In my opinion we can't evolve as humans because many people promote the war and it's the most silly thing that I have ever seen.  </TEXT>
