	<TEXT> Other than growing up in a certain climate, I think it also heavily depends on body fat/muscle. The more insulating tissue that your body carries, the shittier you'll feel in heat and better in cold. 

I was born and still live in Ottawa, Ontario and the winters just fuck me right up. I can't function because I'm chilled to my core no matter what. Summer is finally the time where I can be comfortable and enjoy myself outside 24/7.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "You're a true artist" from my drawing professor a week ago, as she was looking over my shoulder at the current piece I'm working on. I'm only second year of my BFA and hearing that made me kind of stop in my tracks and feel great and confident about the difficult career path that I plan to go down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I'm at work (part-time food industry) and it's a slow shift, I go around to my co-workers asking if I can hug them. Most times it is surprisingly warmly welcomed but that may be due to the fact that I'm a chick and most of my co-workers are guys. I'm not even really a "lonely" person, I'm surrounded by friends on campus usually and have a boyfriend, but being an introverted and mentally unwell person makes me feel completely alone most of the time regardless of the actual situation. So if there's ever someone wanting a hug I will gladly hug the fuck out of him or her. 

In any case though, hugs are great and make me feel a little less shitty for existing each time. So if you see someone asking for a hug and you think it's safe to hug them, please do it. It's the little things that can make someone want to live to see the next day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I met a guy online back in 2014 when I was 17 and 190lbs at 5'5". He was 22 years old, 5'8" and morbidly obese, probably 390lbs if I'm being generous. I didn't have much for self-confidence and felt that he was one of the first people to truly care about me. 

After dating for seven months, I decided I needed to change my lifestyle for the well-being of my physical and mental health. He did not feel the same. 

After six months of weight loss, from December 2014 to June 2015, I had lost 70lbs and was a pretty decently attractive and confident individual, taking pride in my hard work for the first time in my life. He began envying me, constantly accusing me of cheating, and overall being a complete drain in my life. It took me another good six months before I finally rid myself of him.

I haven't really spoken to him much since we broke up in December of 2015, but I think he has started taking a bit more care of himself. He moved into a new apartment with a gym and is getting his binge eating under control. I do feel guilty I couldn't help him while with him but I just couldn't put myself through his negativity much longer, as I have been severly depressed since 2010 and needed to finally reap the benefits of my new life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since the big gals are almost definitely going to be able to handle more booze, try watering down your drinks while no one is looking, or if they're going straight for shots from bottles of hard liquor, take little sips and they hopefully won't notice, assuming they'll make up for it with their big swigs. That's what I usually do and it ends up ok. Or even just tell them you don't want to get alcohol poisoning since you are likely quite a lightweight compared to them. If they're your friends they should understand and respect that fact.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can understand that, but I could also imagine working so closely with someone for months on end and acting like there is chemistry for the camera could also create feelings for one another, especially if the actors in question are young, nave, and wanting to feel loved for real.  </TEXT>
