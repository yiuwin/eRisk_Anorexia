	<TEXT> In many cases, they are scammers and/or attention whores. When the experiment doesn't work, they usually claim (as was the case with that breatharian) that "something" was affecting their ability to "perform", either an environmental factor or the skepticism of the observers. Some will go as far as to claim that their magic cannot be tested or measured in a laboratory because "it doesn't work that way", a good example of that is homeopathy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tipping here is usually, but not always, done by rounding up the tab; so if the two beers were, say, 94 CZK, and you told them to keep the change, that's perfectly acceptable, especially if you're getting it at the bar. That lady at the bar jump into the sea.

As for the reservations. Your "faux-pas" wasn't only wanting to sit at a reserved table, but at *the* reserved table. At many pubs the table(s) closest to the bar is (are) reserved for the *tamgasty*, the most loyal patrons. In some places, it can take years for a regular to be accepted  the tamgasty and be allowed to sit at the table, and some people tend to be VERY territorial and not particularly friendly if a stranger (and a foreigner at that) wants to sit there, especially if they have a few under their belt. Don't take the reaction of that woman personally, she would have probably reacted the same way everywhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is a matter of perception. Asians are seen generally as hard-working people who pretty much mind their own business and their children are, in many cases, born and raised here and very well integrated. Gypsies, on the other hand, are seen as lazy, freeloaders, dodgy, dirty, thieves, etc., etc., but that is pretty much the image they have everywhere. Africans and Middle-Eastern people are still a relatively new addition and many people are still wary of them (and the refugee crisis, and how it has been blown out of proportion by the media and some politicians, has not helped matters, either.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, he has not changed his mind. Yesterday, during that truly embarrassing press conference, he said several times that he would formally present his resignation in a few days, but that before he wanted to discuss the situation with the President. The problem is that the Pisshead in Chief was convinced Sobotka was bringing the resignation latter instead of coming for a meeting with him. Who cocked up, if it was someone from the PM's side or the President's side, is irrelevant, Zeman behaved like a twat, which shouldn't surprise anyone by this point.

PS: I don't give two shits about Sobotka he's a spineless idiot who saw this bluff as his last resort to have a chance to defeat Babi, whom I like even less. </TEXT>

What most likely happened was that someone made a porridge or a soup with some crushed grain, cooking it enough time and at the right temperature to activate the enzymes that turn the starch in the grain into sugars, flavoured it  very ripe fruit and left it unattended long enough for the concoction to cool (maybe [attract fruit flies](https://www.wired.com/2014/10/beer-yeast-attracts-fruit-flies/) and start fermenting, which can happen relatively fast.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When they are clearly out of touch with the reality of the staff.

A bunch of years ago I was working in Prague at the local branch of an international language school. We didn't have a basic salary, we got paid according to how many hours we taught each month.

When the cost of living in Prague started to go up in 2003, a few of us wrote a letter to the management politely asking for a raise and for a benefit scheme to reward the better teachers in a better way than only giving them more work. 

We were told that yes, that we would soon get a raise and they would start putting together some sort of benefit scheme, but that they would need time for that. 

A couple of months passed without words about the raise, or the benefits. One day, they  announced with a rather big fuss that there would be a training course on communication and some other related stuff, which we were all welcome to attend. The course would be three days long, each day from 9 to 4 or 5. Oh! And we wouldn't get paid those hours. Unsurprisingly, not a single teacher signed up. For some reason, however, the management had failed to foresee that teachers may not want to loose three days of paid work for a training course nobody had bothered to ask if they wanted or needed in the fist place. Their response: to complain that, even though we had been asking for a benefit scheme, we had all refused to attend a course that was "clearly" a benefit.

Then there was that time when they refused to give me a day off because, in my supervisor's work, I was the best they had and they couldn't spare me.

By then I had already started with the paperwork to get a trade license and go free-lance, as a couple of my friends had done, and it wouldn't take me long to leave. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't have anything to add about the English situation that hasn't been said already. As for Czech, my experience in the 15 years I've been living here is that most Czechs really appreciate it when a foreigner at least tries to learn the language. When dealing with authorities, the people in the offices tend to be nicer to you if you are able to put a few words together. I remember at the ivnostensk ad -- Praha Zpad back in 2004 when I hardly spoke Czech, two ladies and one guy went as far as to use sign language to explain something I needed to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Left-wing populism (and maybe populism in general) co-opts real and serious social issues with sloganeering, promises and us vs them rhetoric. When they get to power, they start throwing money around as a short-term solution to get "the people" on their side, but never really addressing those social issues. That can last as long as there's money around. 

The problems begin when money starts running out, and Venezuela is a great example of that. It didn't help either that Chvez failed to find a worthy successor and instead, and even though he knew he was dying, appointed the fuckwit of Maduro as his vice-president. But that seems to be common with populist leaders and demagogues, who rely a lot on their charisma and don't want anyone to take the spotlight from them. </TEXT>

[This article](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2016/07/study-identifies-brain-areas-altered-during-hypnotic-trances.html) on how hypnosis alters brain areas among other things says that:

 Only about 10 percent of the population is generally categorized as highly hypnotizable, while others are less able to enter the trancelike state of hypnosis. Spiegel and his colleagues screened 545 healthy participants and found 36 people who consistently scored high on tests of hypnotizability, as well as 21 control subjects who scored on the extreme low end of the scales.

The only things that could be seen as woo are the moon's position and the Earth's magnetic fields (which brings up the question, did cultures back then know about the Earth's magnetic field?). The rest seem quite sensible and, in some way or another, are applied when designing houses.

That being said, I've been to a few homes allegedly decorated according to Feng-shui and, even though I don't believe in any of that "flow of energy" nonsense, I must say they were really nice. </TEXT>

They are stored separately and malted separately. The malt produced with them (Pilsner, mostly) will have each slightly different characteristics. Some brewers will buy a blend of different malts, others will prefer a single variety, depending on what they want for their recipes. Quite fascinating stuff, really. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the linked article:

Allowing one-time therapeutic antibiotics is a slippery slope, says Ronnie Cummins, national director of the Organic Consumers Association, and would undermine consumer confidence in organics. Its the same position [I have] as on human vaccines. They are dangerous, and thats why I didnt vaccinate my kid.

	<TEXT> They would never be able to even get started. Their border regions with Bolivia, Per, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, the Guyanas and Suriname are very remote and getting enough troops there would be next to impossible. Chile doesn't even limit with Brazil and Argentina is way too big to even think about it. The only two countries they could have a chance of take over are Uruguay and Paraguay, but I doubt Argentina would be too happy about it, unless there's a scenario like the [Paraguayan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguayan_War), which resulted in a defeat of Paraguay, but not a conquer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Craft Beer is anything the industry, the consumers and the media want/don't want it to be. I think it should be clear by now.

The BA, as a trade group, have their own definition of Craft Beer, and they have put together a list of what they consider the best Craft Breweries. Anyone getting their knickers on a twist about this should probably get a beer and calm their tits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's another angle to be considered. The rise of extreme right movements (the Nazis, in Germany, and Fascism, in Italy) was to a great extent a response to the threat of Communism after WWI. 

The Communists' loosing the civil war would have likely been a blow to the movement outside the Russian borders as there would have been no victorious regime producing propaganda to promote their ideology, let alone the Revolution. 

It is very possible that the lack of the communist boogeyman would have affected the popularity of the far-right movements in the 1920s, giving rise, perhaps to more versions of the parties that eventually seized power in Germany and Italy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are officially 350 brick mortar microbreweries in the Czech Rep., plus an unknown number of letajc pivovary (flying breweries), as gypsy brewers are called here, some of which are very well regarded, and there are about 40 independent breweries. If we adhere to the commonly used definition, the number of Craft Breweries in this country would be at least 400, in a country of 10.5 million people, 38 breweries/1 mil. Quite a lot more than the UK. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> En serio, destesto hasta la mdula a los activistas antivacunacin. Son unos conchudos, una mierda humana. Todos, sin excepciones. A los que se niegan a vacunar a sus hijos, sea por los motivos que sean, no les tengo mucha ms simpata tampoco. No solo ponen en riesgo la salud y la vida de sus propios hijos, que ya de por s es bastante malo, sino de todo aquel que, por un motivo u otro, no est inmunizado. 

Por otro lado, el hecho de que los medios le den lugar a la charlatanera de las pastillitas de azcar como si fuese algo respetable es de por s lamentable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - Kavrna Liberl and Cakf Lajka in Prague 7

- Kabinet and Krkonosska Hospudka in Prague 6

- Caf Frida, in Prague 8 

- Illegal Beer in Prague 1 

- Bar Na Palme in Prague 8 and the caf right next door to it. 

- Kavarna Potrva in Prague 6

- Volvox Globator, in Prague 3

- Decentni Dyne, in Prague 2

- Kovadlina U Lazne, in Prague 7

These are the ones I can think of off the top of my head. All of them nice places, with relaxed atmosphere, good music by the most part, and good beer.
