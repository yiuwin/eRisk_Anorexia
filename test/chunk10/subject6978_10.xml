	<TEXT> I just finished the 1st week of bootyfull beginnings and honestly the workouts felt too light and like I wasn't working in a way that's going to help me build muscle, I barely broke a sweat especially on workout C. 
Did any of you guys experience this? Should I just add weight to the exercises? But then I would be squatting one day after the other...
I don't consider myself advanced by any means so it's strange.
Any suggestions or opinions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think next time I go on the mat tomorrow I'll have to check about the arms and how long I can hold. But what do you mean by engaging?  
Honestly I still feel weird with my head upside down and it's hard for me to tell what I'm doing right and wrong </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Its it ok to complete the exercises once and not go by the 7 minute circuit requirement? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Around a month ago I dropped bbg after 3 weeks of being into it. I stopped it because I felt too exhausted aiming for a strict 4 circuits of 7 minutes. It made me anxious and I wasn't enjoying the workouts at all. I never moved past weeks 1 workouts because I never actually completed them and felt I couldn't move on unless I actually did everything listed...

Would it be fine to complete each circuit at my own pace, while paying lots of attention to form? I mean, doing all the reps required once, and then moving onto the next circuit, completing each one twice, but without the 7 minute mark? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I babysit three little girls who aren't vegan. In the beginning when they asked me to eat with them and I said no, they asked why. I felt it was right to tell them, but preferred to ask the parents first so as not to cause any uncomfortable situations with them. They were totally OK and they let me openly talk to the girls about veganism, which I appreciate. I preferred to have their support on the subject because I know how people feel about veganism. They are very cool about it, and ask lots of questions. They always let me cook vegan meals for the girls and also bought some soy milk just so I could have coffee when I'm over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, just wanted to share my very short story as a new vegan.

I've been vegan for over a month. I have a history of anorexia so I didn't want to tell my family, as I knew they wouldn't support it, thinking it is an excuse not to eat... My boyfriend has known since the beginning, since I spend most days with him. He doesn't like it, but understands the reasoning behind veganism and tries to support me as much as he can.

Yesterday I finally told my mom, who is a very traditionally opinionated doctor. Her initial reaction was bad, she told me vegans are crazy. I told her I have made my desicion wether she likes it or not, but I would prefer her to choose more delicate words when we speak about it. She calmed down, asked a few questions about what I eat. I informed her my nutritionist made me a plan I follow religiously with all the different nutrients I need. She wants to come to my next session this Thursday.

She asked a few stupid questions like: do vegan moms breastfeed their children? Where do you get your protein from? . and then a few better questions like: which supplements do we need to get you? Are you eating enough calcium?

I later told my sister, who is supportive. She just asked me to make sure it doesn't drive me to disordered eating, which I agree with, and that's what the nutritionist is there for.

I feel more relieved now, and hope I can feel supported in my new lifestyle. Thanks for listening :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have two sisters, with the older one I always got along, and with the younger one most of our lives we didn't get along at all.

There was a period of around six months that all three of us got along, but now I CANNOT STAND both of them. I honestly can't wait  until either they or I move out and I can cut contact with them.

It's sad, but siblings are not meant to be sometimes. I think it's worse when you have to fake a functioning relationship. It's better to just do what you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've tried not counting calories quite a few times, but it turns out I eat very little because I'm so scared to eat too much. When I don't count my days end around 800-900 calories. If I count it's to actually get to a goal.. Like at least 1400.

I'm not encouraging calorie counting in any way, I'm just sharing my experience. </TEXT>
