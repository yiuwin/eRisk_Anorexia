	<TEXT> I don't agree that it's pay to win as you said. Maybe at one point but as of the last year I would say the pattern has been releasing the champions weaker than intended then buffing. Also, you don't need to play a champion with hard cc and a gap closer to win games. One of the best champs in the game right now has neither. But regardless of this, off the top of my head I can name at least three 450 ip champs that have hard cc and are decently strong at the moment. Namely poppy and alistar. Also, winning games has less to do with what champ you play, but rather how well you perform and what you as a player do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure that all champions being incredibly op is true. I would say some are which is normal, but in the past 4 champ releases for LoL only one has been "op" and even then, she(Camille) hasn't even dominated the meta. The others like Ivern, and kled are well balanced and generally fun to play. Not super broken, but not insanely weak either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the past champ releases only really one has been flat out broken and even then it's debatable. The others namely ivern and kled are pretty well balanced and really fun champions over all. Not only that but champions are balanced every patch and most of the time it turns out well.

	<TEXT> Here's what's going on. We as a staff team basically have our hands tied by the shotbow server being updated to 1.9 and the delays that came along with it. We literally can do nothing substantial until we have a set date where we can even start development. And it's great that you can see yourself coding it in that time and I'm positive that the team of devs we will have on it will work as fast and thorough as possible to get a great server to all of you. The truth is that we did not see these delays coming when we began the process and the staff team as a whole was blindsided by the delays. Trust me when I say we're all just as restless and excited to get this thing rolling as you are but we ask of you guys to understand that there's nothing that can be done at the moment but wait.

	<TEXT> Here's what's going on. We as a staff team basically have our hands tied by the shotbow server being updated to 1.9 and the delays that came along with it. We literally can do nothing substantial until we have a set date where we can even start development. And it's great that you can see yourself coding it in that time and I'm positive that the team of devs we will have on it will work as fast and thorough as possible to get a great server to all of you. The truth is that we did not see these delays coming when we began the process and the staff team as a whole was blindsided by the delays. Trust me when I say we're all just as restless and excited to get this thing rolling as you are but we ask of you guys to understand that there's nothing that can be done at the moment but wait. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like Kayle top into a burst based again and her passive makes her effective against tanks with the Armor/MR shred it gives. She's weak against a champ with sustained damage or who can bully her out likewise. I've always had trouble against Malphite because of his AS slow on his E, jax also makes life difficult because he can deal his damage sustained while also gap closing with his Q. Kayle does really well against a GP as you out range him and can bully him into his tower as well as hit his barrels from a safe range.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kayle is really good against almost all assassins as she can negate a huge chunk of burst damage. Her matchup with Zed is very favorable as well as Talon and other bursts champs. She's weak against champs who out range and can effectively bully her out of Lane early before she scales into late also champs who use some form of CC as part of their combo which negates Kayles Ult and utilizes her squishiness. A few that I can think of are Malzahar, Annie, and Ahri with their CCs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I feel like I play decently most of the time and my builds and macro play are all okay at best. I can also keep up with silvers and golds when I play with them. But why do I keep losing games? Is it my rotations and overall view on how I play? Do I tilt too hard? Are there ways to improve my landing also toplane because it always seems to be my weak spot. Also, are there to plays that I miss due to map awareness or lack thereof? Any help would be awesome.

Also I realize you're a jungler so you might not know exactly toplane and supp mechanics but general macro gameplay areas are what I would like to improve. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Discussion] Deaths Till Raidable- What would you like to see happen? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-25 16:18:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Today's discussion is on DTR! For those who are unaware, DTR (Or Deaths Till Raidable) is how many times a faction member can die until your base becomes Raidable and can be broken into. We wanted a bit more time to discuss this topic internally and figured allowing more time for you guys to talk about faction size wasn't a bad thing, so with that out of the way, what would you like to see with DTR?  This includes the DTR cap, rough estimates to what faction sizes should have what DTR (I.e. 5 people having 3 DTR) and anything else of the like! Feel free to be out there, we'd love to see new ideas as well as recycled ones to add to our own!

Thanks for the suggestions ahead of time!
