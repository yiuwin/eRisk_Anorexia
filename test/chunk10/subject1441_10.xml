	<TEXT> Agree completely!  You can justify your need to eat to your eating disorder when you're still in the gain phase. It makes you feel like you "deserve" it. 

As far as getting past that, I must say, I'm still working on it. What has helped me make headway, though, is eating enough (including that extra cookie I really want now and again) and then getting weighed at my therapy sessions and seeing my weight not change. Kind of proving to myself that I do need food to maintain and then occasional extra treat or whatever won't hurt me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too have struggled with this. And I'm still living at home and my mom is upper middle class so it's not even me paying for it. The feelings of unworthiness of spending money and being a burden but become too much for me. My therapist had me do ERP with grocery shopping- slowly working my way up to spending more money and buying fear foods and such. That's honestly been the most helpful. Have you worked with a therapist with this kind of training?  Also, feel free to message me if you need to talk or want more details of the ERP.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Everything in my life is fine. I'm overbooked a little so it's stressful but it's a good stressful. I have friends finally and a decent job. I just started dating a wonderful man who is incredibly sweet to me for some inexplicable reason. I've mostly beaten my social anxiety and my OCD is mostly controlled. 

But all I want to do is not eat. I've been making excuses to avoid food and I've been exercising more. Fear foods and fear of restaurants and parties with food has returned. I lied to my boyfriend today telling him I was sick because I was afraid of the buffet we were going to go to tonight. I don't want to do this again, but I can't seem to help myself. Anorexia just seems easier even though I know how shitty it is. 

Sorry for the novel. I just really needed to vent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, how are your other ED symptoms right now?  When I was at my worst for anorexia, I had these same things happen to me. Constantly thirst and drinking insane amounts and needing to pee. Sometimes so badly, I would have accidents and such. When I was treated inpatient, they tracked my fluid intake and determined that my kidneys were in the very very early (but reversible!) stages of kidney failure. It was absolute hell, but they restricted my water intake to very specific amounts (don't do this without medical supervision) to get my body functioning normally again. During that time, I had all the dry mouth and headaches and stuff of dehydration. It sucked, but that with mandated nutrition was the only way to fix it according to my doctor.  </TEXT>
