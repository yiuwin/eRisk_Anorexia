	<TITLE> [S] Casca After The Next Chapters... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-09 01:35:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If Casca gets her memories back after the coming chapters (assuming Miura doesn't do a backstory or change pov), do you think she will/should remember the years between the Eclipse and now? 

Personally, I'd rather her remember the Eclipse and everything until now--from living in the mountains and running away, Guts nearly dying countless times to save her, and the relationships she's had with Farnese and Puck and the rest of the current cast. It would make the story flow better and segue easier into the next arc and Casca's recovery. It would also be interesting to see if remembering the time-gap from while she was a potato could help lessen the immediate trauma of the Eclipse. 

What do you guys think? Would it be better for her to not remember the past few years or still have her memories and have to deal with not only what happened, but she reacted to it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The synopsis on Goodreads for the first book (*The Atrocity Archives*) sounds more satirical than scary. Are there any of the books in particular or is the [synopsis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101869.The_Atrocity_Archives) just misleading? 

It does sound interesting nonetheless. Thanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I ended up starting Ship of Fools the night before making this post. Due to the repetitive recommendations, Blindsight is going to be read next. 

Fingers crossed that the ending for Ship of Fools isn't disappointing...?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I already have Blindsight. Don't think it was recommended as being 'creepy' or horror-y, so I'll try getting to that book soon. Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What's Your Favourite Sci-fi Horror? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-17 05:15:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As the title suggests, what's your favourite Sci-Fi horror novel? Rather, which piece of science fiction literature has genuinely terrified (or stuck with) you?

I've been pretty hungover over the Priest's Tale in *Hyperion* because that gave me a really unsettling, 'terrifying' feeling. To a much lesser extent, the similar unknowing-ness and mystery of *Rendezvous with Rama* has always been disconcerting, as has the overbearing cruelty and hopelessness in *I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream*.

So, again, what is some of your favourite Sci-Fi horror, whether or not it was intended to be? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does he have any horror-centric works which you'd recommend? It's been near impossible to find something as disturbing as the Bikura imo, and it's a nice change of pace.  </TEXT>
