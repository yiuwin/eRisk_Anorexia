	<TEXT> Feige said that the Spider-Man franchise will be "like Harry Potter".  Suppose there are eight Spider-Man films.  The first one comes out in 2017.  The last one would come out in 2038 assuming one movie every three years.  More realistically, we could expect Spider-Man films every other year after 2020 so we would have movies in 2017, 2020, 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028, 2030, 2032 and 2034, nine films altogether.

Spider-Man would also appear in Avengers films, say Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers 4, Avengers 5 and New Avengers 1-5.  The New Avengers would consist of Spider-Man, Miles Morales, Kate Bishop, Nova, Quasar, White Tiger, Stature and Ms. Marvel. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can somebody explain American network TV schedules? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-18 03:24:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I feel old.  I remember how back in the sixties TV seasons ran for 26 episodes and then were rerun.  If you missed an episode then you would have to catch it as a rerun (assuming it wasn't preempted by election coverage or the State of the Union).

In the eighties suddenly we started getting reruns in the middle of the season.  The season then ended later, as late as June.  Back then we would check our listings and see that the show was on and take the chance that the episode could be a rerun.  Obviously this was better for ratings.  The term "summer rerun" no longer applied.

Now I hear that Networks don't show reruns anymore.  (I have been living in Asia for the past 20 years.)  And seasons are rarely more than 23 episodes.  That means that in any given time slot a network will show something different than what is usually shown in that time slot.

I can understand why they don't show reruns anymore as there are streaming services for people to catch up on episodes they miss.  Also, people can DVR episodes and watch them later so they are less likely to miss episodes. 

I remember how network seasons decreased from 26 episodes to 22 so that networks could show Christmas specials and still be able to rerun the whole season.  Do any shows go beyond 26 episodes in a season?  I mean, if a show is popular then why stop at 22 or 23 episodes?

I hear the term "mid season replacement".  Conceivably a network could show an entire season of a show and replace it with a new show in February.  But I suppose if a show is being cancelled because the ratings are poor they won't bother showing a full season.

One thing that really confuses me is why shows take long breaks in January.  What do the networks show in January instead of the regular network programming?  And what do they show in the summer now if not reruns?

I watch American TV shows on local TV.  I don't get to see episodes right away because the local channels wait until January and show the whole season in five months. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The theory of multiple intelligences differentiates intelligence into specific 'modalities', rather than seeing intelligence as dominated by a single general ability. Howard Gardner proposed this model in his 1983 book Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences. According to Gardner, an intelligence must fulfill eight criteria:[1] potential for brain isolation by brain damage, place in evolutionary history, presence of core operations, susceptibility to encoding (symbolic expression), a distinct developmental progression, the existence of savants, prodigies and other exceptional people, and support from experimental psychology and psychometric findings.
Gardner chose eight abilities that he held to meet these criteria:[2] musical-rhythmic, visual-spatial, verbal-linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic. He later suggested that existential and moral intelligence may also be worthy of inclusion.[3]

If there are multiple forms of intelligence then there are multiple forms of stupidity.  Chances are we are all idiots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you need to be more specific.  Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist are already connected.  Agents of SHIELD has dropped a dozen references to Peggy Carter.  Season 5 of Agents of SHIELD will presumably react to events that happen in Punisher, Inhumans, Cloak and Dagger, Runaways and New Warriors.  I wouldn't expect any actual crossovers between Agents of SHIELD, Punisher, Inhumans, Cloak and Dagger, Runaways and New Warriors.  

One problem is scheduling: Marvel might not have any control over when Freeform drops Cloak and Dagger or when Hulu puts out Runaways so they couldn't very well tell a story on one platform and have it continue somewhere else.

Another problem is tone.  Freeform is presenting both Cloak and Dagger and New Warriors but Cloak and Dagger is a drama and New Warriors is a comedy.  When was the last time a 1 hour drama crossed over with a half hour comedy?

We also don't know what the tone of Punisher will be like but in a December 24, 2016 interview Jon Bernthal said "He aint got a fucking cape. He aint got any superpowers. Hes a fucking tortured, angry father and husband whos living in this unbelievable world of darkness and loss and torment." so don't expect Squirrel Girl to show up on that show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of people say that Marvel movie contracts have an NDA (non disclosure agreement) and that actors are signed on for 6 movies or 9 movies or whatever.  Evans, Helmsworth, Downey Jr., Holland are all supposed to have signed on for six films and Jackson is supposed to have signed on for nine.

Thing is, including Avengers 4, Evans and Helmsworth will have done seven films.  And Evans also did cameos in Thor 2 and Homecoming.  Evans did say that when he finished doing Infinity War that his contract would be "done".  Some speculated that Captain America would die in Infinity War so that he wouldn't have to do a seventh film.  There was even a rumor that Thor, Cap and Iron Man would not appear in Infinity War and that they would only show up in Avengers 4 but that rumor has turned out to not be true.

I suppose it is true that Downey Jr. was only signed on to six films originally.  They probably envisioned three Iron Man movies and three Avengers movies at most.  Maybe Downey Jr. was planning ahead so when they would ask him to do cameos hw would say "No, you have to pay me to star in the movie if you want to be in the movie" so Downey Jr. got big roles in Civil War and Homecoming.  

Obviously Marvel will ask actors to do cameos in addition to the movies stated on their contracts but they can't make the actors do them.  This probably extends to TV: Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson were probably not paid movie wages for their appearances on Agents of SHIELD.  Other actors may have been asked to make appearances on Agents of SHIELD only for Marvel to be turned down.  Marvel may have had to ask Evans to use footage from The First Avenger on Peggy Carter in which case he was obviously cool with it.  

Then there's the TV contracts.   Adrianne Palicki said Marvel "asked her" if she was willing to appear in movies.  What this probably means is that regulars on Agents of SHIELD (and probably other Marvel TV shows) are asked if they are willing to do cameos in Marvel movies, which is what everybody wants Marvel to do.  It would be a problem if every actor asked for a million dollars just for a walk on role so they vet people based on whether they are willing to do cameos.  I don't know if this applies to recurring background characters.  I don't know if actors who appear as recurring background characters sign any sort of contract or if they just feel lucky to find work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't speak for other people but here are a few things to consider.

1) Some people like the actress.  Cobie Smulders played Robin Scherbatsky for ten years on How I Met Your Mother.  Some people are just following her career.  

2) It's a question of continuity.  It's like asking "What happened to the Hulk after Age of Ultron?"  Is he just going to show up in Thor Ragnorak with no explanation?  In the case of Maria Hill, we have to assume that she was at Avengers compound in Civil War but Marvel wasn't going to pay the actress to just walk by in the background.

3) She's one of the few characters to appear in movies and on Agents of SHIELD.  The others are Nick Fury, Sif, Coulson, Dr. List, President Ellis, Jasper Sitwell, Gideon Malick and Peggy Carter and the Howling Commandos.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Feige doesn't believe in magic.  On Agents of SHIELD, Coulson says something along the line of (to Eli Morrow) "You're a thief.  You're not creating matter.  Matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed.  You're just taking matter from somewhere else, another dimension."

If you can accept that there are other dimensions with different laws of physics then the bigger question is how these extra dimensional energies can be manipulated by concentrating and saying words.  That's just the part where you have to suspend disbelief.  It's a fair compromise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a Justice League story arc that pits the gods against their superhero counterparts; Zeus against Superman, Hermes against the Flash, Apollo against the Green Lantern, Hades against Batman, and Poseidon against Aquaman.  Obviously, Green Arrow is Cupid / Eros and Wonder Woman is Hera and Black Canary is Artemis.

We can extend the analogy with the Avengers.  Thor's analogy would be Hercules.  Alternatively, one could argue that he is more like Zeus, the Greek god of thunder.  Hawkeye is another Cupid.  Scarlett Witch and Black Widow would be Hera and Artemis.  Captain America is basically a Christ-like figure in the MCU having come back from the dead so that would make him Apollo.  Tony would be Ares, the god of war, having literally profited from the sale of weapons.  Quicksilver was another Hermes.   And Namor, if he ever shows up, would be Poseidon.

Then there's the Guardians.  Mantis is your Venus / Aphrodite and Yondu is another Cupid.  Analogies can be made between the other Guardians, Drax, Groot, Starlord, Rocket and Gamora and the Avengers Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man and Black Widow.  In Greek Mythology, Persephone was abducted by Hades so if Thanos is Hades then Nebula is Persephone.

So, yeah, this topic has been discussed before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For long running shows it is possible for background characters to move into the forefront.  A good example is CSI.  The show had a lot of minor characters who ended up getting their own arcs and even had episodes that focused on them.  But things are more complicated with Arrow because the show is supposed to focus on its one main character (Felicity Smoak... no, seriously, Oliver Queen).  The Flash has the same problem.  Wally doesn't get development because he's not THE Flash and the show's not about him. </TEXT>

Sony has got to be in 5th place then but the article doesn't state that.  I can go by the fact that Sony Entertainment is making more  money than Viacom.

	<TEXT> The problem is that ABC already has a show at 9:00 called Fresh Off the Boat and there's been no word on whether it has been cancelled or renewed.  Are they going to show Inhumans at 9:00 and start a new season of Fresh Off the Boat in November?  That decision may not even be finalized yet.  The show at 9:30, Imaginary Mary, is definitely gone so they would need something new at 9:30.  Part of the reason for moving AoS to 10:00 was so ABC could schedule "family friendly comedies" at 9:00.  Now, it is true that the Inhumans TV show looks like a joke but I think it's trying to be serious. </TEXT>

It will also be "the end of the story for this Guardians team" which suggests that characters will go their separate ways.  It seems like a sad way to end things.

	<TEXT> Season 5 probably begins in November.  We will probably only get 14 episodes although this could be increased to 18 if Inhumans is a massive flop.  I am assuming that Inhumans will occupy the 10:00 slot until Agents of SHIELD returns.  It just seems like too much of a risk otherwise: if Inhumans is only eight episodes then they will have to replace it with something in November.  That's why AoS renewal was almost guaranteed.  (The other possibility would have been the surprise announcement that Inhumans had been ordered for a full season instead of just eight episodes.)

If ABC is worried about costs then this will probably be the last season.  I hope we get to see vampires this season and Blade shows up.  We could also see Bobbi and Hunter although the actress playing Bobbi may be more expensive because she has been in movies.  Don't expect a Wesley Snipes cameo because he would ask for a lot of money.  Ditto for Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner or even Howard Mackie.  We need one episode of Ghost Rider versus Blade and then they could do a Nightstalkers spin off if the budget is available.  

The big question is whether or not Inhumans, if successful, would get renewed for a second season and if it would be a full season.  Maybe we could have pods, say 7-8 episodes of Inhumans, 7-8 episodes of Agents of SHIELD and 7-8 episodes of Nightstalkers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That doesn't take into account money made from merchandising.  "Since the first George Lucas-helmed [Star Wars] movie premiered back in 1977, the franchise has made approximately $12 billion in revenue from toy licensing alone (for more, read: How Netflix Pays for Movie and TV Show Licensing). As a comparison, the "Star Wars" movies have brought in $4 billion in box office revenue."

from How Exactly Do Movies Make Money? | Investopedia http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/093015/how-exactly-do-movies-make-money.asp

Seriously, Joel Schumaker got his Batman gig because he promised he could sell more toys than Tim Burton.

It also doesn't take into account that a movie like Batman v Superman has a built in audience.  All you have to do is tell people that Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman are going to be on screen together and people are going to show up.  You have to spend a lot more money to promote a romantic comedy or a drama.

This is also why studios want big name stars, not just because they may be better actors but also because they can do interviews in magazines and on talk shows and promote the movie.  The movie doesn't even have to be very good as long as the actor can get asses into seats.  (This is probably why Jim Carrey doesn't get work anymore.  He's got a reputation for trashing movies he has starred in before they even come out.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the Academy was closed down.  The aircraft carrier was never mentioned again.  

In theory Agent Weaver could appear as a background character in a Marvel movie but most people -if they recognize her at all- would be confused because she hasn't been on Agents of SHIELD for a couple of years and we don't know what she has been doing.  Supposedly Christine Adams is too big of an actress to be a random background character on Agents of SHIELD.  

Original characters from the TV shows need to show up in movies.  It doesn't have to be the big stars.  The actor who plays Daredevil will ask for a lot of money to be in a Marvel movie.  The actor or actress who plays a random background SHIELD agent won't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, you have to have a Black Widow movie.  Agents of SHIELD can say things like "The Director wants you to do this and the Director wants you to do that."  They don't have to show Coulson.  In fact, they can bring back Nick Fury and movie audiences will understand that he's part of SHIELD and will assume he is the director again.

Second, I checked imdb and I found that there are half a dozen agents that have been in five episodes or more.  (Davis has been in twelve.)  Maybe some of them are dead now but they wouldn't bring back actors after they have been killed off and give them the same role.  </TEXT>
