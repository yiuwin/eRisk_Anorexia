	<TEXT> Paige. I have suffered from an anxiety disorder for my whole life essentially and I would like to know how she's doing, if the ALDC still remains as a traumatic memory, or if she sees it for the positive experiences and tries to dissociate from the negative. I know that my anx developed from social rejection from my siblings and peers- wonder how it must have felt coming from an adult, an AUTHORITY figure. Honestly, Paige should write a book someday. I bet she will. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to take care of your hair... It's fine to have it long, but it's greasy as fuck. That will contribute to acne. Also no, you're not fat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She made fun of my favourite musician after I asked her to stop. Sounds petty but she's very judgemental and that was the last straw, I suppose. Said musician was getting me through a really tough time, I really look up to her, and ex-friend knew that. She was just looking to put me down and be a snotty little bitch. </TEXT>
