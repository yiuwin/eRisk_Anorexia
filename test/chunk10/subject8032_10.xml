	<TEXT> If the genie is already happy and free as a result of your first (and second?) wish, then he may not "wish" for anything. 

Does wishing for happiness mean that you are wishing to be eternally, unconditionally, without interruption, content? If so, then I think the wish would go unused, because it would become uninteresting. 

If being happy and free simply means free from the bottle, and happy, as in happy at the moment to be free, rather than being made miserable by being "freed" from what might be his natural condition or something, then it depends on what we presume about genies... or about the particular genie?

Depending on that, an intelligent genie, who presumably knows the pitfalls of making wishes, might even still just decline to use the wish. If it's a social justice warrior genie, it might wish for an end to the enslavement of genies? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Comparing Germany and France: Why did they turn out so different? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Forgive and correct any mistakes or gaps in my understanding, but given that both Germany and France have roots in the polity that was Francia, they seemed to develop in two very different directions. Although I know that France had its ups and downs, it seems to me that France has been a much more unified state than the Holy Roman Empire, which later gave way to Germany, etc. Perhaps this is just my false perception, but this is based on the fact that Germans have been split up into many small principalities historically, and only became known as something like modern Germany in 1871. 

Essentially, was there some policy, person, or set of ideas that made France become quite centralized, while it's eastern counterpart became a different kind of de-centralized empire, that would later break up into smaller states, and then re-unify most of the german ones into a single country? 

Is saying that the French region has been centralized while the German side has been decentralized a fair generalization? Am I downplaying the internal struggles France has had with regions outside of Paris too much?

	<TEXT> Short answer - no. History is a great hobby for a lot of people, and is valuable to society even in just that capacity - however, it is not a smart thing to get a degree in for the vast majority of people. </TEXT>
