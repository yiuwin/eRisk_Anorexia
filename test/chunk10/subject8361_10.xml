	<TEXT> so often we were at max capacity for cats at the shelter that people would come in after finding a litter of kittens (sometimes kitties that would need bottle feeding which these people are not able/willing to do) and we'd have to turn them away. that's what really sucks about the series of hoops they have set up, we couldve helped more. idk, just my opinion  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was actually from a breeder. I know that will get me some hate but listen, I applied for like 5 kittens, one after the other, at different animal shelters and fell in love with each one every time. Was turned down for different reasons each time (two kitten minimum adoption/ there was a application ahead of me that I didn't know about/ I was not the minimum age at the time [I was 20, age was 21], I was too far away for them to do a home visit/they found out the kitten was sick about would not be placing him). It was so heartbreaking thinking I found my forever friend and then coming home to an empty cat tree. 

There are so many kittens out there who need loving homes that breeders should be unnecessary, but I couldn't deal with the let down. I know that the shelters are just trying to find suitable homes -- I've volunteered with cats/kittens for a loooong time (the shelter with the two kitten minimum policy) but sometimes they make things difficult to the point where it isn't helping the kittens. I think being without another kitten to play with is much better than being out on the streets. Besides, he has a cat-sized dog to play with (and they do play!). 

Anyway, the point of this was... he is a persian mix/british longhair mix. Lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Always appreciate the concern for animals though :) I was not offended by your comment at all, glad he has someone else in the world who cares about his wellbeing. Just trying to put your mind at ease, he is handled with care. I've volunteered with cats since I was a little kid and am pretty aware of their support needs when being held. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way this pup is all curled up and looking so blissful reminds me of how my hamster looked when he got lost for 4 hours and we finally found him.

Teddy was our family pet for a few years before we adopted our two dogs. I was like maybe ages 6-9 or so when we had him. Once he got out of his cage while one of us (my brothers and I) changed his water and forgot to close the door back up while doing so.

All 6 members of my family tore the house up looking for this little guy. We kids were devastated -- sobbing, apologizing for being bad hamster parents, saying he deserved better owners... it was a fiasco.

Finally, we found him. He was curled up in the tiny dungeon of our toy castle (you know, the castle https://schwingeninswitzerland.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc_0273.jpg). We let him finish his nap there since he looked as content as this pupper.

Thanks for reminding me of this. Simple times :) Rest in peace little guy, rest in peace. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you can't see because it's lost in all his fluff but I have pretty big feet, he was well supported. he just looks all floppy because he has a very ragdoll personality and sort of just hangs loose when picked up at his midsection </TEXT>

	<TEXT> oh I misread somehow! We have personally decided against a prenup (that said, I can totally understand why some couples have one) but we are too much of hopeless romantics that having a document in place for a potential divorce that doesn't align with our fairytale. Again, this is *just* him and my decision for *us*-- I am not arguing against any other couple having one or criticizing their reasons for it. touchy subject, i've found. 

edit: upon realizing this can sound like maybe they're right about the gold digger accusation: my parents are in the top 1%, i'd imagine. we are not starved for cash. they are generously paying FH's remaining tuition and living expenses since he has been cut off, which they have offered as an option long ago if he ever wanted/needed to set tighter boundaries. we are both preparing for careers where we will soon be self-sufficient. none of their money is needed or wanted.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought giving him a fake name would make it read easier, no? I can change it to SO if need be. apparently in portugal it's impossible to disinherit a child which I why they are panicking. I feel that that's not really our problem. 

edit: read the rule, gotcha! FH it is </TEXT>
