However, I would buy one, especially if we got to choose from a list of succulents which ones to have and also choose our own pots/glasses. I'd expect something that is palm sized to be $20 of it has 4 or more succulents decent sized ones and a mini one with tiny succulents to be $10-15 depending on type of succulent and the number of them too. Would be cool to have custom pots too for a premium ($5-10 more I'd say) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. There are quite a few Chinese, but in the streets and living here I'd say there's a huge variety of people of all cultures. But I really do appreciate the abundance of Chinese people here - there is actually night life (and that Westfield stays open fairly late, winning!). Give it a year or two and the place will be utterly gentrified. Parramatta will be going that way too. Sad thing is that most apartments here sit empty. I don't have neighbours on my floor for example. But I would love to buy into this place before the prices go beyond 700K. I just love the culture here. 
Another good place is Croydon followed by Concord. And if you don't mind the interesting transport Rhodes and Wentworth Point too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd argue it has far more reliable transport than the eastern suburbs and North Sydney where I grew up.

The CBD is a poorly designed mess of buildings and the inner west where it can expand to is mostly residential, making it near impossible. Hubs which can and will be well planned like Parramatta and Bella Vista are our best hope of moving or putting high paying jobs elsewhere. Microsoft in Washington isn't in Seattle, it's in a city outside of Seattle called  Redmond. Facebook headquarters isn't in San Francisco, it's in a smaller city more than an hour away from the CBD. And this all works.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cheap? Far from it. Our CBD needs to expand. Parramatta is one small step in the right direction. Next should be further west in the Hills District and south towards Cambelltown and Glenfield. That's where people can afford housing, that's where jobs need to go - where the people are. Not the other way around. We have seen for the past decade that this isn't working.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> La Perouse - lots of beach and rock pools to explore with a surprising lack of people. When I lived in Coogee, I would take the bus here to hang out with my dog and just relax and find small crabs. There's also a lighthouse which opens for tours.

Burwood Park - lots of cute ducks and the park is very organised and large enough for you to find a nook to stay. I think there is also council wifi here (or at least there is near the Oliver Brown). 

State Library and the park near the Art Gallery of NSW.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An antiseptic and numbing lozenge should do the trick. I believe Strepsils makes one. Be warned though, some people find the numbing agent to produce a laxative effect. 

Alternatively, drinking warm honey and lemon tea is rather soothing and a warm salt water wash is mildly antiseptic. You can also take malt drops. I'd advise against alcohol because it could make an infection (if there is one) sting and not necessarily get better. If symptoms persist, get it looked at for strep.  </TEXT>

Sailor Moon and most other manga, video game and anime characters have features that look white like eye and hair colour, because the technology and design limitations made it hard to differentiate between characters. Whether Sailor Moon is of Japanese heritage is a different argument because it's never discussed, but I'm fairly certain a series made for a Japanese audience consciously created a non-Japanese ethnic main character. She's just Sailor Moon. Matoko from Ghost in the Shell however is a more complicated concept which is deeply explored in the series. She's explicitly Japanese. Interpreting her as otherwise is stupid  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't really say much except, do what feels right to you. I got married at 18. Almost 6 years later and we are still good and strong, if not stronger than we were all those years ago. We can throw stats and anecdotes around, but at the end of the day, we aren't in your relationship and we cannot truly judge. 

A lot can also happen after you get married and you have to know, deep within whether or not you can deal with it. My husband was injured on deployment and he had to use a wheelchair for the majority of 2 years. Not to mention the PTSD, ensuing financial troubles and having to work 3(!!!) jobs whilst attending university full-time. If someone asked me if I would be determined to face that and be with him if I marry him, I can guarantee I'd say no, lol. But the fact is, that I stuck it out and would much rather go through all that again if it means I have the amazing man who is my husband. 

So yeah. Do as you please. We can't predict the future - good or bad - but you can decide on which options are available to you and which ones sound better.  </TEXT>

I can't speak too much about the porn. Mostly they would be prostitutes or boys kicked out of home for being gay etc. Russians also look quite young for their age in their early 20s. I would not be surprised if the twinks were chosen to look feminine and youthful because it is meant for a straight audience. Regardless, I wouldn't be surprised if they were under age. They're gay and poor. Their choices are to suck dick or die.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So....I was born in Russia.

Prior to Putin, Russia was becoming more progressive since a little before the downfall of the Soviet Union. There were plenty of gay bars, drag culture, my parents were very progressive as was my grandmother (still are) and I even have a gay uncle. A lot of musicians were actively appealing to a queer audience, and even implemented aspects of queer culture. Ruki Vverh and Tatu for example. It's just sad what the country has become by giving anti-gay people a voice, a platform and power. Interestingly enough, queer celebrities are well loved and so is camp and men dressing up as women. The government, and thus the media, censors the well-known fact that these people are gay, or their flamboyance and style is actually a display of queerness. They just want to enjoy it and pretend it can still be a straight thing so they don't feel too sinful *eyeroll* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Angkor is lovely, but probably not feasible in the little time you have. Checking in and out of hotels eats up a lot of your time since check out is usually before noon and check in is 2pm. So half your day is gone waiting to get your bags in your room, unless you want to pay extra for storage. If you had 7 days, that would be great. 

When I did my Asia trip, I used Expedia religiously. Agoda was a mess and having talked to a few independent hoteliers, not only does the site mess up their details, but also payments take a long time to get to them, the commission fee is huge and they sometimes don't get info on their end for days at a time. So use Expedia. It was the only one people were actually organised with dealing with. 

Also, there aren't that many flights going direct to Cambodia. They usually stop at Bangkok or KL. So you might be better off going to Thailand and seeing Wat Arun, Wat Phra Kaew or going to Ayutthaya. </TEXT>

Well this certainly brings me back. The phenomenon you are experiencing is called 'convergence' it is a form of social code switching where when you talk to a specific social group you adjust the way you speak so that it suits the social group and makes you sound similar to members of the group. People with migrant parents know this really well - when they talk to their parents they usually speak with an accent, but don't when speaking to friends who don't share that ethnic background.

	<TEXT> FFXIII and XIV are drastically different games - for one, the latter is multi-player, and XIII was a hot mess, pretty, but my God wtf was up with those battle mechanics?? In fact, each of the final fantasy games should be treated as stand alone games. The only things they have in common is typically a really rich storyline and male characters that either look like they enjoy eating dick or like they front-line a heavy metal band on their time off. 

Dragon Age on XBOX and PS4 should be the same game. I play on PC so what do I know about consoles, lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Historically, this is true, but not so much today unless you include the Catholic Church. Basically, most known paedophiles were affluent, influential men or were part of 'sacred' institutions. Then there was also the fact that it was considered okay for girls aged 14 to get married, it wasn't until women were taken more seriously in the work force in the late 60s that it died down, but it still happened more in the South. 

Today, paedophilia and paedophiles is seen more favourably than homosexuality in conservative religions. However this has a lot to do with power and control as well as manipulation in some cults. But to the general public, both are either equally bad or paedophiles are much worse than gay people  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on how you look at it and how much being gay has impacted your life. Being gay is a part of who I am - it explains why I had been discriminated in my past, why I can still continue to be discriminated and why people don't treat my relationship seriously. It's a part of my identity because people have used it to give me certain life experiences which have impacted me in such a way to shape who I am. But does it mean I identify with the scene? No. But I'd be lying to say that being gay hasn't in some way shaped my personality, just like my racial identity - it's something that put me in a certain social position and I've had to adapt in ways straight people don't have to.  </TEXT>
