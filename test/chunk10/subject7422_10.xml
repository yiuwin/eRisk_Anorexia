	<TEXT> Yeah I guess you're right. Maybe I just didn't want it to end. I thought it was a great show and I guess the ending kind of left me wondering about a few things and I didn't really get closure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I liked it too. I guess I just don't know what too make of the ending. I think I was blinded by Don's charisma the whole time and never looked at him like he was a shitty person. You get to see the background he came from and you sorta feel sorry for him. But I guess everyone has issues and it's how you deal with them that counts. I guess Mathis said it best though about him in episode 10 of season 7, "You don't have any character. You're just handsome. Stop kidding yourself." </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mad Men Series Finale </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I just finished the last episode of Mad Men and I don't know what to think. The whole time watching the series I kept trying to figure Don out. I think he was a lost person who never really figured out his way until the end. I kept thinking the whole time how confused, lost, and empty he was and how he just used money, sex, and liquor to fill those hole's in his life. In the last episode he was talking to Stephanie before she took off on him and he said "I understand people." but he never seemed to really understand himself. Or maybe he did and he just chose to deal with it in a way the he saw fit. This episode left me hanging, I feel like I need one more to sort everything out. I guess maybe he finally found his happiness, but I don't know. I'm just sitting here in a daze thinking about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why do you think that? I didn't see the end of the Tennessee game live. I was watching the game in a bar in downtown Athens and they cut the cable before the hail mary happened. </TEXT>
