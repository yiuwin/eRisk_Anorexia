	<TEXT> This is basically how I felt watching Erased (Boku dake ga Inai Machi) I was shipping these two pretty hard throughout the whole series.

Erased is about a guy with the ability to go back in time moments before a life-threatening incident - allowing him to prevent it from happening. 

It was an exciting watch, Id recommend it if youre into mysteries that relentlessly tug at your heartstrings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a good drawing from reference! You have a good understanding of the different levels of shadow. I think your hatching (shading technique) could use a different approach, the way you are shading with the pen is more of a zig-zag technique with can get messy even though it's faster. I'd suggest trying straight lines for a cleaner look. It takes patience the first couple times, but you might like how it turns out! Keep up the hard work! I'd love to see more! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would absolutely love a voice over just with scenes from the manga. 

I actually came across this little voice-acting channel on Youtube that did a Watamote scene and it wasn't that bad! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmm4Iqr9vtU

I wonder if they would be up to doing a project like that :p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for this! I'm not a religious guy, but I just might pray for the best in the spring :p

And you're right about the second batch of stories, there is a little bit more character development from other characters. I would love to see the relationship between tomoko and Komiyama animated, but it would be challenging.

I checked out that video! It's nice hearing the lovely Kitta again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, I see. Well at least we have the manga :p

The idea of a fan-made film intrigues me though! It wouldn't even have to be that long. A well-done 5-7 minute short would be awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm yeah I understand. I still find the manga funny but it doesn't "milk" the situations as heavily as the anime does. It's more of a conversation between the writer and the reader whereas the anime is more of a performance. That's just the way I like to think of it. 

The manga is pretty easy to digest, each chapter is basically a daily slice-of-Tomoko's life and you can catch up pretty quickly(new chapters are still being made)

If you take your time with the manga, and just enjoy it for what it is, I think you'll like it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah from what I've gathered that seems to be the general consensus. All I can hope to do is try and find anime similar to it. I've tried reading other works by the same guy like "Choku!" and watching "Welcome to the NHK" but they don't really do it for me.

And you should definitely give the manga a chance! One gripe I keep hearing about the anime from people is that Tomoko doesn't progress much through season 1. But where I'm at in the Manga, she's definitely grown up a little and even [spoiler](/m "has made some new friends that have lunch with her everyday") 

It's also interesting seeing the differences between manga Tomoko and the Anime one. I think she's a little more unapologetic in the manga, and possibly a little more perverted. hahah. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Watamote Season 2 Kickstarter? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Just got caught up with the manga and all the spin-offs, and I gotta say, I am yearning for a continuation of the anime! I haven't connected so viscerally with an anime like this in a long time.There are so many great moments (particularly from the school trip) that I would love to hear Tomoko's voice actor do. 

My question is, would you guys support a kick-starter or something like that for season 2? I wish I knew Japanese and could email the creator asking for something like this. I really love this series and I'm sure some of you out there feel the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too am alone in my fandom. In my experience, GG has always been a tough show to get my friends into. It doesn't help that I can't really explain why I'm so into it. Whenever I put on an episode to watch with a friend, they're just sitting there waiting for the "funny" to happen. It's not like a funny video clip or a tv episode, the pacing is very different. You have to learn to enjoy the silly atmosphere Danny and Arin create as they grump through these games, you have to have the patience for improv to stumble upon these "happenings" that the grumps create. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good for you man(or woman). I know life can be shit sometimes, but there will always be people out there that feel the same way, you'll never be alone. That episode of Wind-Waker rang true with me as well, I've struggled with depression to the point of unhealthy obsession and when I heard that little speech from Danny in Wind-waker, that was the moment I realized the healing powers of a couple of dudes playing video games and shootin' the shit. They seem like the kind of people who I could just hang out with and talk about anything, they're one of us, and it's so comforting when they share stories that we can relate to. 

Anyway, I'm ranting...but I just want you to know random person that I'm going through a lot of hard times right now too and I can relate. Stay strong. Laugh often.

	<TEXT> Love the channel, loved all your fallout NV runs, and all the introspection is nothing to be ashamed of man, it would be a shame to NOT have a highlight reel after all of the creative carnage we've seen these last 30 episodes. Btw, NO healing permadeath?! Are you insane?! hahah It will definitely be interesting though </TEXT>
