	<TEXT> Some of my worst binges have been on "healthy" foods like a bowl with a serving of blueberries, fat free yogurt and granola mixed in for crunch. And then it's so fucking delicious the bowl just keeps magically refilling itself over and over. *and over* 

So much for serving sizes when I taste that shit.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same. I am very much an all or nothing person. I can't have "a small snack" during the day to ward off hunger pangs, or it will trigger a "EAT ALL THE THINGS" compulsion so I have found that eating once, at night, is the only way I can exist.

Needless to say, maintenance didn't work out so well for me in the traditional sense. My attempts at maintaining have mostly been me eating normal amounts for 2-3 days, losing control and binging for 2-3 days and then feeling absolutely guilty and restricting/fasting for days/weeks to punish myself. This is the cycle I have been in since the start of the year. It's great! ahahahakillme

But everyone is different so don't let me and my lack of control discourage you, OP.

	<TEXT> Okay I'm probably 98% caffeine at this point but seriously, this is my day. I wake up at 5 am-ish, if I slept at all, and have one standard size mug of coffee with a Stok shot and grab a Rockstar out of the fridge to take meds with. Sit down and dick around on my phone, drink coffee (2-3 mugs) until it's time to start getting ready for work. Drink Rockstars and coffee all day while at work - usually 2-3 more mugs of coffee. Get home at whatever time, make another pot of coffee. Drink more coffee and til I eat my dinner. Eat my meal o' the day, take my sleep meds, wait for them to work or not, sleep maybe and repeat. 

I know I drink 3 Rockstars a day most days, but the coffee fluctuates wildly between 4-5 cups a day and a million lol. I honestly don't even know if caffeine affects me all that much anymore. I just really love black coffee.  </TEXT>

I have a bad habit of nicknaming everyone and everything, tbh. My boss, oh lord haha, he's listed as Ham Fists on my phone. Hope he never sees that lol. We call one of our customers Nancy High Pockets because she wears her pants up to her freakin' sternum and I almost accidentally called her that to her face last week. Oops!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I nicknamed my dogs Needy Gonzales and Emosabe (she gets mopey when she isn't physically attached to me). I have also been known to call the old one John Squincy Adams when he gives me the stinkeye, or Grumbledore (what up, HP fans!) when he's talking smack. But as far as nicknaming myself?!? I have no idea. 

I am in constant motion so I guess maybe Twitch? I dunno. Or my username is pretty accurate lol.

One of my coworkers calls me Tiny Dancer when he catches me losing my shit with my earbuds in and I think I'm alone, but I wouldn't necessarily call it dancing so I think that one's out.

	<TEXT> Welcome!

Sorry about your friend. I understand that too well, and it's a sadness that never truly heals. My best friend since childhood, who knew everything, passed unexpectedly a few years back and I miss her so much every single day. I have dealt with an ED since I was young, and she as well, and it was just so comforting to have her friendship. I never had to explain why I just *couldn't* eat something with her, or why I was having a bad day if I weighed a pound more or any of the other ED inspired traumas we fight with daily. She was the one friend who got it, who I didn't feel pressured into faking "normal" around. And she totally understood if I bursted into tears over a cookie. Her ED was compulsive overeating/BED so her struggles were different than mine, but we still understood. We just both had seriously effed up issues with food, and there was no judgement. And I mean, it wasn't just the food things that made us so close. We both dealt with anxiety and mood disorders, shitty family issues, etc. We shared the same twisted sense of humor, hobbies...ugh, I miss her.

I wish I could say that loss feels better after time, but I still feel it like it happened yesterday. My heart goes out to you. I journal to my friend when it gets overwhelming. I just write like she will be able to read it and it helps sometimes. I'm not religious so I don't believe in God or Heaven, but I just pretend she can read it and it helps. 

Hugs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am so sorry you are going through all of this. I know when I'm feeling like a piece of shit, nothing anyone says can get through to me, but please just know that I, a complete stranger on the internet, owes a lot to you and I think you are an amazing person. You are bright, enthusiastic, compassionate, empathetic to everyone else's struggles while minimizing your own, and amazingly kind. You always tell people how beautiful they are, and compliment them, and build them up when they are tearing themselves down. You made one such reply to one of my posts recently when I was feeling super horrible about myself and it just hit me in the feels. You made my day. 

Anyways, I ramble a lot because communication is not my strongest skill. But I think you're awesome, beautiful and kind...please don't be too hard on yourself. 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I order ephedra powder (called Mu Huang where it is grown) from a site where I buy all of my other botanicals. I hate going to the pharmacy to buy Bronkaid because it makes me so anxious that one day someone at the counter is going to say "Oh you can't buy that because you bought some this month already" and then they'll think I'm making meth with it or something lol. Idk, anxiety yay. Also I just prefer to buy things in their natural state when possible. Ya know, because it's healthier and I'm into that. (also a fucking lie ha!)

It's cheaper and I don't have to deal with human interaction when purchasing online so 10/10 recommend going that route if you're like me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been maintaining and I hate it. I feel like I'm quadrupling in size by the minute. The bloat and water weight is dreadful. Can't say I'm at all interested in continuing to maintain. And I feel a total loss of control over my life, my anxiety, my motivation etc this week which makes me even more determined to just go back to restricting. Everything else just seems to fall into place when my focus is restriction. 

So [here](http://imgur.com/xo8gI27) I am today. Me and my fluffy little work buddy. This morning's weight was 93 lbs. I need to update my flair but that feels like I'm accepting it and I'm not lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Omg, you basically just wrote my own reply for me. All of this is so accurate. The GW thing ... Like, I never know how to answer that because there IS no magic number where I will suddenly feel better. I feel so ugly inside and out and no number on the scale will change that. 

My ED was never about the weight or how I look but more about the torture of it. The loss is important only because it is tangible proof that I am accomplishing the goal of depriving myself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a form of punishment. It started as a way to punish myself. For being ugly, for being fat, for being hated, for being a bad person, etc and it just spiraled from there. At first, I wanted it to kill me. I genuinely felt like suicide by gun or overdose was too quick, I wanted to suffer. So I thought giving in to the ED and starving to death would be the perfect torture. 

Over time it became my coping mechanism and I really don't know how to get through life without it anymore. The obsession with watching the number drop, the counting of calories, the feeling of my bones, the mental planning of everything consumed...it keeps my mind busy so the depression and anxiety of life and the monsters of my past don't overwhelm my brain. I don't necessarily want to die anymore, though I know that's the finish line for my ED...oh the irony. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh wow, I could've written this post. I had to stop buying them because, like you, bars were becoming the only thing I would eat. At first they were a miracle food for me - some way to ensure I was getting protein and nutrition in a tidy little pre-measured package I could just grab and go. No muss, no fuss. But over time I went cravings crazy for them and I literally couldn't stop thinking about when I was allowed my next one.

Pretty sure crack is in like the top five ingredients of those things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome from another control freak/tattoo lover. 

I agree with just riding it out as best as you can until you graduate and aren't under such scrutiny. And as far as your Dr forcing you into inpatient, pretty sure that unless you're a minor, that takes a huge amount of legal hoop-jumping for anyone to be able to force an adult into a treatment they don't want. Like, you'd have to be on the verge of death and declared mentally incapable of making your own choices.

I don't know why but this cracked me up so hard lol. Maybe give her *one* and then let her know that she missed out on more because she failed Fluffkins. 

Also, I hide my binge foods too. My roommate has been threatened with bodily harm if he gives me any of my "cheat" food outside of acceptable times. Basically I can go say "Hey, I want this or that" one time a day and he'll dig out whatever pre-portioned junk item I want. Right now I'm on a peanut butter kick and I know if I knew where that container of peanut butter pretzel bites was hidden, I'd eat the whole damn thing. You're amazing for not mauling all those chocolate bars! Not sure I could resist temptation like that right now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, because honestly this stupid disorder already controls so many aspects of my life and it's overwhelming af to deal with *my* fucking issues. I also tend to absorb and internalize emotions of those I am close to, so it would end up feeling like I was disordered x 2. Plus when I actually do allow myself to be close and care about another person, I am a fixer by nature and I'd devote all of my efforts to them and their health and lose any sight of my own. Which I mean hello irony lol like my own health has mattered jack shit for a while now.

I just imagine that I'd be a shitty partner for them, either way. It says nothing about them having an ED, but everything about my ability to cope with anything at all like a normal fucking human. </TEXT>
