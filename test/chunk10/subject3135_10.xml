	<TEXT> I agree. I don't think it'll be cancelled by the CW. Gina got the CW their first Golden Globe nomination and she won that award.

I think that coupled with the fact that the CW knows the showrunners have a planned end will convince them to renew the show for however long they need to tell their story. Plus as much as Gina loves being Jane, she's not going to stick around the CW forever. She's much too good of an actress for this network. </TEXT>

I live *inside* the 32nd State Senate district by ~0.4 miles but live *outside* the 6th Congressional district by ~0.6 miles. My polling station is literally across the street from the 6th Congressional district. One person even walked out without voting because they were only looking to vote in 6th district race. </TEXT>

I live about 2 miles away from SunTrust park, and everything I can see on Google Maps right now is a bright, bold red. According to Google, there is "heavy traffic in [my] area" and "typical conditions with delays up to 34 min". So, yeah. I'm not leaving my apartment until tomorrow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh, this is me in reverse, so I know exactly what you mean! I got obsessed with losing weight and and eventually starved myself down to 100 lbs by eating less than 500 calories a day. I was diagnosed with anorexia, but like you said, I went from one extreme to another in my recovery. Currently I'm borderline obese and I never thought I would be this overweight.

I some how skipped past the healthy weight and never learned how to sustain myself in the middle. It's one reason why I'm afraid to loose the weight. I don't know if I'll know how to stop in the middle and not take it to the extreme again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm first and foremost \#TeamJane, but I guess it'd depend on how much Raf and Jane have changed in these 3 years. The writers have said that Jane will have matured a lot after Michael's death and that Raf is different after prison, so I'd want to see how they interact with each other. There were a whole mess of reasons that they originally broke up for, so if some of those were resolved and they write their reunion story well, I'd be happy with the pairing. </TEXT>
