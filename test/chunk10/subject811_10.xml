	<TITLE> Abolishing other bad habits... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-09 04:01:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey there!  
I was wondering if anyone had experiences in quitting other bad habits while on their weightloss journey? What is it that causes these changes? 

A little over a month ago I stopped biting my nails out of the blue and then my dermatillomania soon followed (though it's still a little prevalent, I'm working on stopping it.) Twenty four years of fighting with myself over these awful habits and then I just dropped them out of nowhere. I figured now is a better time than ever to start my weightloss journey because of this sudden mindset and I've managed to get rid of about 5lbs so far and maintain a healthier lifestyle - and enjoy doing it! (I'm aiming to get rid of around 60lb in the long run. Wish me luck!) 

I just wanted to know if there are other people who've experienced these kinds of lifestyle changes that were triggered by their weightloss journey. Is this normal? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe they had 2 temporary mods to "keep things under control" because prior to the AMA, there were only two of them. Locking the thread also seems like a weird thing to do even though Dan's finished answering. Ah well.  

If anything I've learned *what not to do* if TWRP ever decides to stop by here, haha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I asked the same question under a different account and it wasn't deleted - and Dan also answered it. So there ya go!   

I'm happy you got a question in, haha! If I'd known this would all happen I wouldn't have approached the AMA in the first place, so sorry about that. I do feel mostly responsible for the change in rules (regardless of what he claims). </TEXT>

If that isn't an open invitation to bad vibes then have I got some news for you.

	<TEXT> Censoring people when it's their one and only chance to have someone they admire finally talk to them is a pretty awful thing to do, bud.  
Especially when you have yourself asking questions every time Dan replies to someone/making sure you had the first question in in the AMA.  
Please go somewhere else.

	<TEXT> Sorry for ruining your fun friendos!  
But it looks like if you mention TWRP in the AMA now, your comment will get deleted.  
This is probably my fault as it seems there's still some existing bad blood between one of our former mods (and mod of r/Rush) and here.  
Though I would argue that TWRP has a lot to do with Dan's career - but I don't make the rules there! Just keep that in mind!  </TEXT>
