	<TEXT> I am saying hello because I know that you will see this at some point.


Hello you peice of poopy human garbage. You are literally the worst thing that has ever happened in my life. And tomorrow marks the 4th year of  your slimy invasion into my world. With every passing day, I realize more and more what kind of opportunistic, sick fuck your are. How little conscience you must have. And how much I regret my niave, trusting self. 
Right now,  you are probably sitting there reading this with a smirk. Thinking that you got the better of me, that you used the fuck out of me and were able to escape just like that. 
The entireity of me knowing you, you have manipulated, cheated, lied, abused...You did it all. From emotional blackmail, to physical assault to constant threats of suicide in order to get what you want, to theft of thousands of my hard earned 2-job working dollars and fraud with using my info. You fucked up my whole life. And I am now paying the full price   trying to rebuild myself. But at least I CAN sleep at night knowing that I am a good person. That I did all the right things. I never stole or lied or manipulated. And I did all that I could to help you, even after we were done and I had no obligation to do so. I didn't take advantage of anyone with the promise of anything I wouldn't live up to. After everything, I was a humane human to you.

I know karma is real and true.
Mainly I wonder how it must feel to know that if your father was alive today, how disappointed and disgusted he would be to have a cowardly, parasitic leach of a son like you.

	<TITLE> Has anyone had brain abnormalities detected and followed up with them as a potential cause for their seizures? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, I'm curious to hear from anyone who was perhaps in a similar situation.



I had pretty bad seizures when I was an infant. During my child/adulthood, they were pretty rare and did not disturb me to the point of getting them checked out. This was until last year, where they were getting pretty frequent, more intense and from what I know/seen, I believe I was having complex partials. As it is standard practice to get an MRI and EEG when being seen for seizures, I had them done last year. While the sleep deprived, 60 min (I think) EEG didn't catch unusual activity, there were some brain abnormalities that were found with the MRI. 
There were 2 cysts. One is controversial (pineal gland cyst), because doctors believe it is mainly asymptotic and do not believe it causes anything but also, when it does become symptomatic, is also known to cause seizures. Throughout last year, I was supposed to be getting regular MRIs to check up on the cyst and make sure that it did not get any larger. 
However, I have been unable to because of a bad financal situation and getting MRI every few months is burdensome to a broke student.

Anyways, my seizures are coming back pretty intense this month (I believe because of stress) and I am trying to determine if it would be worth it to check up on this cyst, even if it puts me in a worse off financial situation. My question is if any of you guys have had brain abnormalities like this (or any) that had correlated to your seizures and if you had followed up on them/got them treated if your symptoms were alleviated at all? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel so calm. 

I have never felt so at peace with everything. I finally know what needs to be done. What the world has been telling me for years. It took years of battle in thought. But with every flow of logic I have attempted, and every rational perspective I have sought, it has become more and more apparent. 


At last happiness shrouds me now. Some might consider the irony of discovering this happiness at such a time.

But I have finally found a beautiful truth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The birds singing in the early morning in the months starting spring through the summer always brought me so much joy. I would feel overwhelmed with an overall feeling of excitement, bliss and satisfication when I'd hear them in the morning. Even if I woke up sleepily and with a lot on my mind. I can't describe the peaceful joy I got when I would hear them. It was joy in its purest. It was perfect. Like they were a sign to me that all was well in the world and I get to live and breath another day.  


This morning, I heard them and felt nothing. Just exhaustion. I woke up and laid in bed wondering why am J even getting up this morning? What would happen if I just didn't go to work or class? Why have I not just made myself disappear from the world yet?


Spring and summer are the seasons I always felt more well and like I could flourish. 


What do I when that disappears. When those birds no longer sing me back to joy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well here it goes. I never really talked about this to anyone. I didn't like thinking about it. I didn't want to admit it, and I hate painting myself as a victim. I still feel like I should have done more to prevent it or made better choices to keep it from ever happening. I should've been smart. I still feel like it was mainly my fault and I should not even claim it was rape. But I've been stumbling on other people's accounts who had been raped and found some striking similarities. Maybe this was rape, idk. Well here it goes. I think I was raped. 
A few months ago, I was out with some people. We smoked weed, pregamed hard and hit the clubs. I barely had much experience with these substances (I maybe drank twice in my life prior to this  night, and never smoked). Needless to say, it hit me hard. I was still pretty coherent at the clubs. We took more shots. I get pretty drunk and we all head back to our dorms. At this point, I'm not stupid stupid drunk. Still coherent but pretty stumbly and slurring words. Everything kinda feels like it's moving in slow mo and I'm getting the spins. We get up to our room, but my key doesn't work, and my roommate is upset because it is late so she ignores me asking her to open the door. So I slump down in the hallway and in my drunken stupor, decide it's fine for me to just pass out in the hallway between the rooms until the morning. Then he comes up. Asks me if I want to smoke. I say okay. Bad decision at that point but the alcohol is kinda doing the thinking. We go out and smoke with one other girl who also wants to. We come back to the dorms and I just want to lie down somewhere and pass out. But oh yeah, I forgot...I'm locked out of my room. The girl says goodnight and leaves to sleep in her room. I'm standing in front of my door. He asks me why I can't get in. I explain it to him. He asks me if I want to just sleep in his room. "We have an extra bed" he says. "Okay", I reply. And I know his roommate. He's pretty chill and wouldn't really ask questions in the morning. We go in. I look for the extra bed. "Which is it"? I ask. He shushes me and pushes me up to a top bunk. I lay down and try to keep the spinning under control. Next thing I know he is laying next to me. I turn around to face him. "What?" I whisper. "Wanna watch a movie?" He asks. "Okay". He opens his laptop and goes to Netflix. "What movie do you want to watch?" He asks while pressing himself even closer to me. I can feel the warmth of his lower body and his hardness as it presses against the curve of my backside. "Ummm I dunno. Something scary." I slur. He puts on one of the suggested scary movies on Netflix. I can barely keep my eyes open. I try to sit up but each blink makes it harder and harder. My eyelids feel so heavy. My eyes blink hard and finally I give in to their tiredness for a few seconds. Then I feel his hand creeping up my shirt. Instinctively I grab his hand. He was massaging my boob and it felt good at that moment. I grab his hand and place it where it feels best on my chest. He keeps playing. I feel comfortable but still so tired and start passing out again. I'm jolted awake when he grabs my hand and places it on his hardness. "Are you falling asleep?" he asks annoyed. "I want to." I mumble. He presses my hand hard onto his fabric. 
"Do you want this?" He asks.


And here is the part I beat myself up about.  I must have said okay. Therefore it must have been consensual.


Next thing I know he is on top of me. He starts positioning himself and I feel starlingly aware of what is happening. I am a bit afraid but am so tired. He starts feeling me up with his fingers down there. In my mind, I decide I willer him get on with it so I could finally get some rest. "You're so dry" he mentions. I don't say anything, don't react and just want him to hurry up so I can rest. After all, he shared his weed with me, and allowed me to sleep in his room, so it seems only fair. 


Then there is a sudden shocking pain as he starts to insert himself. I am surprised and start to get up to push him away. I keenly remember telling him no,I didn't want to do this anymore. Does that count for anything? I should not have even said yes or went into his room in the first place though.


 He shushes me and says it's because I'm too dry. I hate pain. I want this to end. I had barely had sex up until that point and has nevee experienced something substantially large inserted into me. I know there will probably be more pain and I try again to get him to stop. He doesn't. Instead he grabs my wrists and places them above my head and starts seesawing in and out. It hurts. I cry out. He doesn't stop until I wriggle free from his grip and push him away. The rest is a bit more blurry but I remember at some point being afraid because he had gotten into me again and I started thinking of protection. I tell him to go find some, and as he is out of his room looking for some I run out and frantically try my key to my room again. It actually works this time and I run to my bed and pass out. 


The next morning everything hurts and I have trouble passing urine. It burns. I google my symptoms and believe it must be a UTI. I miserably walk back to my room and cry in bed for the rest of the day. I hate myself. 
A few months later and I still hate myself and regret that day. I still believe it was mainly my fault. It was a painful experience but I could have prevented it if I was smart. And a part of me must have wanted it or was asking for it. Who just goes to sleep in someone's room without knowing what they were getting themselves into? A few months later, and I still get jumpy when people try to touch me, even when it is a hug. My mom tried patting my back the other day and I about jumped out of my skin. Maybe I am being dramatic about the whole thing.


I am still unsure if this is rape. I hate thinking about t. I need confirmation either telling me it was or it was not in order to quell my mind full of turmoil.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There is this guy. No. I mean this man. He has helped me realize what I am attracted to in people. And he has set impossible standards for the people in my life. I believe he has ruined me. You see, I never really knew what I was looking for, or what I was attracted to physically in men, until I met him. I just sort of dated the people who were interested in me, without asking myself if they were the best match for me. Or if I was really that interested in them. But this man has completely changed this. To the point where I look for any speck of him in almost everyone I encounter now. 


He is not handsome in the most conventional sense. He is tall and thin. A bit lanky I suppose. And he is dark. In fact, he has the darkest skin I have ever seen on a person. And big, observant eyes. Not judgmental. Just watchful. When he looks at me, I feel as though they are consuming my image. Searching, hungry for any non-verbal cue I might unintentionally emit. His cheekbones jut out in an almost haunting fashion. I do not believe a model who has been photo-shopped can even mimic. And his smile. Agh. It makes my heart melt whenever I am able to see it. It is sheepish. Goofy in every sense of the word. And the most fragile thing about him. I can tell that he tries his best to hide it. In a nation where we are all obsessed with straight pearly teeth, I get the sense he is all too aware of his teeth's crookedness. But if I was given the choice to gaze at world class paintings and art in a museum for the rest of my life, or to be able to watch the expressions on his face, I would pick the latter. And I would give so much just to see that precious smile dance on his face for a few seconds.


Beyond the physical. This man is the smartest, self-aware individual I have known in his 20's. He is intelligent in every sense of the word. Book smart. He is going to a top ivy school to study subjects in STEM. Socially, he is as gracious as a butterfly and connects with everyone he meets. He is able to make anyone laugh, and can crack contextually appropriate jokes that would put Trevor Noah to shame. He is possibly the most charming person I have met. His list of accomplishments is confusing to me, because I cannot even begin to differentiate what success is greater than the other. And yet, he is the most humble man I have known. He never once told me about his accomplishments on his own accord. I have always had to ask or more or less pry into such things. It is almost as if he is embarrassed about all that he has accomplished. His modesty extends to every part of his life. He laughs and pokes fun at himself in the most beautifully comfortable way. And yet, he understands so well how to be cordial and professional when need be. Since I've met him, he has been the first person I prefer to go to for any kind of advice or any kind of opinion. I adore the curious look of ponderance that appears on his face as he listens intently as I tell him a situation. His answer to any question I may have is always so eloquently stated. So well thought out and articulated. 


He is so emotionally in tune. I do not know if it is especially with me. But he can understand exactly how I am feeling without even asking. I remember the first time I made eye contact with him. I could not look away from him for a few seconds. I felt a slight tingle go through my body and goosebumps grow on my arms. And the most startling thing I look back on now is that I felt an immediate yearning to be close to him. My soul sort of ached to be near him from that moment on. And it was as if my brain was made aware that that I would be close to him and simply accepted it. And it did happen. I wonder if this is what people mean when they say "soul mate"?


The cliche part. I never knew for sure what I wanted from life, until I met him. I never knew I one day wanted children. A family. A stable home. Until I met him. I never knew what I was missing. I never knew how apathetic I was about people. How much I let people use me and take advantage of me. I never knew I would be spending the rest of my life looking for him in every person I met.


My life's curse is that I will never have him. He appears in my life. And then disappears.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's good for you, but you should still be accurate, since you are making such grandiose claims about an entire religion and all the people in that religion. 

This is the equivalent of a person trying to debunk evolution, or any scientific theory, and when asked for the scientific evidence they say, "Well I don't know, I'm not a researcher. I hate science, do you think I would pay attention to scientific fact?".
Or in your case:

"Obviously by my rhetoric it can be told I was literally not scientific. My family were scientists, and I rejected their methods. You really think I would pay attention to a detail like how many fossil findings there were linking us to past primate ancestors?"

This has no logic and is lazy. You should know whatever is you are arguing about like the back of your hand in order for you to make valid claims about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if I am being a bad friend or you're being a bit needy. All I know is that every time my phone dings, my insides turn.
I don't know if this is normal. Even when I tell you I am doing work, that is really important for me to finish, you seem to think it is okay for you to text me because **you** are free. When I don't answer for a bit, you get upset and get an attitude. During the semester, I would be busy and if you invited me to your house and I didn't go, you would be upset and ignore me. You've asked me to come over to your house late at night, in freezing weather just so we can hang out, which is fine if I was free, but if I am busy I'm afraid to tell you that because you get upset so I constantly have to make excuses! And I hate lying! Recently, you've invited me to some gatherings, even though I told you I had something quite important to finish this weekend. You didn't seem to get the picture and kept asking me to go with you places. Maybe you did it out of politeness. Maybe it is because I am so introverted in nature that this bothers me. But I just can't stand the constant barrage of texts from you when I am trying to do something important. Just because you are free, does not, and I repeat, does NOT mean that I am. I have known you for close to a year and a half and only recently,  since this fall have we even been getting close. Ever since you broke up with your bf. And all of a sudden I have been elevated to your "bff" status. I suppose that is fine and dandy but I rarely have the time of the day to relax for myself. I just got out of a bad relationship myself and want the time to heal by myself. And I feel as though you are trying to distract yourself or have someone there to help replace all the time you spent with him. I hope you understand I am not here for your entertainment. You can't just ring me up or text me and expect me to just appear at your place or text you back that instant because you have nothing to do.

	<TEXT> I don't care anymore. i found a bottle of oxeycodone, another bottle of a strong pain killer and some other pills, I'm not sure what they'll do. But anything will work. Anything is better than normal. I'll take a cocktail of them in the morning and go about my day, less stressed, less angry less, less sad, more numb, more chances of feeling joy. Not happiness, but will do.

	<TEXT> When I came home late to my mom that night, she asked what was wrong  with me these days. Was I on drugs? Pregnant? Why do I keep silent? What am I doing with my life? Tired of the accusations. I broke and told her what I had tried to do. No, I'm not on drugs. Not pregnant. Why are my eyes glazed over? I am dazed. Lost. Confused. I hear voices. I see things sometimes in the shadows. I get delusional. I tried killing myself. I was teetering on the edge of the platform on the railroad tracks. I closed my eyes. Felt the wind ruffle my hair and bite my cheeks. I felt alive. More than ever before. I heard the shush shush of the train. The squeak. The horn.

I look back and see my him innocently buying us train tickets. I can't do that to him. So I step back. 

I dont tell her all of it. She gets quiet. I couldn't answer her questions. My throat closed up. I croaked.


Next thing I know, I'm at the hospital. On a bed. They're asking me questions. I have to wait, they say. The doctor will see you in a bit.
Hours pass. Every 30 minutes the nurse comes and takes my vitals. I wonder why. My blood pressure can't have changed that much through that hour. More hours pass. I'm stripped, only wearing the gown. No shoes. No phones. No devices of any sort.


 I sleep and I wake up. And all I have is myself. It is frightening. 


Finally, the doctor comes. He asked some questions. Do I feel better than when I did before I came in? No, I think. Yes, I say. Am I still suicidal? Do I still feel like I will harm myself? Yes, I think. No, I say. 


And just like that, I am released. I pass out in the car while my father drives us home. What will make you happy, he had asked. Just tell us, anything, we'll do it. He begs. 

I feel terrible. I do not know what will. All that I know is I am not.
