	<TEXT> In a word, factors. Ten is only divisible by two numbers, but twelve can be divided evenly by 2, 3, 4, and 6. You don't have to break out the decimal points if you want to divide into thirds or fourths like you do with base-10, and that has a lot of useful applications in normal life. </TEXT>

My big dealbreaker is that my bedroom is also the computer room, and I prefer to sleep with as little ambient light and sound as possible. Does anybody have a recommendation for a mid-tower chassis without excessive LEDs or other lights, and would preferably will keep the whisper quiet (damn near silent) if I keep the computer on overnight?

	<TEXT> It has to do with diminishing marginal returns. When you already have some measure of CDR then adding more will give you smaller and smaller fractions. Let's say you have a skill with a base 30 second cooldown. If you find a bunch of CDR-rolled gear you manage to get that down to 24 seconds. Adding a gem to that would only give you 12.5% of that 24 seconds, not the full 30, which comes out to a smaller sum. Does that makes sense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, if it's actually *your* road, then that's fair enough. That's your road and you can maintain it as you see fit. My question is, how do you enforce who is or isn't allowed to utilize it? It wouldn't make sense to buy and maintain a road that anyone can use, because the wear and tear would be exactly the same, only now you're footing the bill instead of Uncle Sam. So it must be made for you and maybe a few buddies you want to stay connected to. So then how do you protect against trespassers? Presumably tax-funded police and highway patrols aren't an option, being government goons and all. You'll have to personally hire someone to patrol your road, as well as fences and other active or passive defenses. Alternatively you could do it yourself, though I imagine you'll be plenty occupied doing whatever you do to pay for all this stuff.

I'm not saying you can't find ways around these complications, but it does seem like a lot of extra effort just to not be a hypocrite. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So Inarius is basically the "father" of all humankind, having fallen in love with a demon named Lilith to produce the first of the Nephalem. This first generation was strong enough to beat angels and demons, and Inarius feared their strength so he used a powerful artifact called the Worldstone to weaken them over the centuries, eventually settling into the normal humans we're familiar with. But very rarely, a human is born with the original Nephalem strength. It's only happened twice in history, the first being centuries before the games with a guy named Uldyssian, who fought Inarius and won. As a result of his downfall, he was captured by the forces of Hell and tortured (as mentioned above). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what allows me to think Sean Connery's character in The Rock was actually his own James Bond persona, years later. That character was James Mason who took up the James Bond mantle just before the events of Dr. No in 1962. That movie ended with him and his sexy ladyfriend being captured by the US Coast Guard and detained in Alcatraz. Mason escaped and returned to MI6 just in time for From Russia With Love and the subsequent Connery-era movies. News of his escape came to light in 1973 and he was recaptured and interred, just in time for the Bond mantle to pass onto Roger Moore. There in Alcatraz he languished for 23 years until he was called upon to help Nic Cage fight terrorists.

Most of this actually lines up surprisingly well with what you learn about James Mason in The Rock. </TEXT>

Batman and Robin was a really bad movie, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't bad enough to turn all involved into pop culture pariahs until the end of time, at least in my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know nobody asked, but I'm going to attempt to explain it because I'm studying for my CCNA and explaining the concepts helps me as much as anyone else.

So, three of those numbers the IT guy said (the ones with the format xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) are Internet Protocol addresses, which is used by a router to know where it needs to send information. The last one (the 00:80:0E:FF:EF:23) is a Media Access Control address, which is literally burned into the network interface card of your computer, or in other words your computer's "physical" address.

Any IP address that begins with a first octet of 127.xxx.xxx.xxx is called a "home" or loopback address, that individual computers may use for testing and local troubleshooting.

The 192.168.1.xxx address space is similarly reserved as a private address, used only by computers communicating on its own small network (for example, within the company), but not by anything else outside. In order to reach anything on the internet, the router will take that private IP and translate it into a valid "external" address that can go out without confusing other routers.

So to recap, his address is usable only by his local network, the home address is universal to every computer using IP, the physical address is intrinsic to his computer and can't be changed without replacing the card, and the external is an address he can use on the internet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That works because it turns out later in that poorly exposited scene with the Architect that the entire idea of a prophecy was, in fact, one more layer of control within the Matrix. The robots were already aware of the "systemic anomaly" (read: people who would reject the Matrix) and so added one final layer to allow them a controlled power fantasy wherein the resistance won.

What a fucking gut-punch that was. Everything Neo and the entire resistance had done was just another layer of the Matrix, meticulously controlled by the robots just like everything else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't doubt that's going on, but I don't think it's the whole story. Consider the Bill O'Reilly controversy right now. You can see it as a cynical decision to can him when the lost revenue from his advertisers pulling their support outweighs the draw from his audience, but it's proof that those advertisers are listening to the will of the people, if only because that's where the money is. Corporations are just machines following the money; since more people are thinking left-of-center than ever before, catering to that mindset is what will net them the highest profit. It's cold, it's logical, and for the purposes of making progress, it's fine by me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There aren't a lot of people who have been to all fifty states, so it's hard to say. Personally I had my best years for the two I was stationed in Guam, which isn't even really a state.

Edit: shit, didn't answer why. Short answer, I'm inclined toward tropical weather and the people were some of the friendliest I've ever known to strangers. The downside is it's crazy expensive since everything is imported, the speed limit is 35, and if you don't give yourself something to do you could have island fever really quickly.

None of that really bummed me though, so it was a good time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Area Damage procs 20% of the time, every time an enemy takes damage as long as the damage is not from a proc (ie, if you do the damage, not your items). It deals a percentage of that damage (the AD you have on your gear) to every other nearby enemy, up to a maximum possible of 194%. If enemies are tightly bunched then having high Area Damage can deal the pain with extreme efficiency, sometimes as high as 4x your base damage. </TEXT>

I'd had no credit at the time but a lot of cash so I paid a lot upfront, and because of that high down payment they tell me they wanted to give me a special offer where they'd upgrade me to a 2017 model at very little increase to my monthly payments. It sounds great, but do you suppose they have an angle? What are some red flags I should be looking for if I went back to the dealer to hear their pitch? </TEXT>
