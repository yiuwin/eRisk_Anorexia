	<TEXT> Thanks Trevor for doing this AMA! Appreciate it! See you around! :) 

We chose May 18th to celeberate Netflix US releasing Riverdale but looks like it will be happening tomorrow instead! 

Remember to be respectful and don't ask too much of personal questions! Let's have fun!

	<TEXT> Hey Clark!

Question about the show:

* What would you personally prefer? I am not asking for hints/future of the show, just wanted your preference. 
Agents of Shield going back to the more spy oriented espionage show or continue on with the Inhuman storyline? Especially with spread of the Terrigen and the merge of the Inhumans I assume it'll be hard to avoid it. 

* Do you want Ghost Rider to be a series regular or have his own show to explore his own mythology?

* And of course the question you'll always get asked is that do you want Coulson to interact with Peter Parker and also the Defenders?


Side Question:

*  How much did you enjoy visiting Calgary? Come back for Stampede! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What's new in /r/riverdale? Murder Detective Contest Results, Riverdale Season 2, Spoiler Period   More! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-15 22:01:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey gang!

First season of Riverdale is over and it was a fun ride! Here is a recap of what happened in /r/riverdale and all the news we have so far of Season 2 and others!

**Murder Contest**

* We had a [contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/riverdale/comments/5xo1ue/you_think_you_have_figured_out_the_murder_post/) for a special flair who guessed the closest to how the murder played out and who killed Jason. We had 2 people who guessed the closest to how it played out, /u/trufflepastaxciv   /u/yamitcg. Here are their respective answers: [Trufflepastaxciv](https://www.reddit.com/r/riverdale/comments/5xo1ue/you_think_you_have_figured_out_the_murder_post/dek4ra6/)   [yamitcg](https://www.reddit.com/r/riverdale/comments/5xo1ue/you_think_you_have_figured_out_the_murder_post/dek6n7w/). 

* In the end, /u/yamitcg came out on top! Congrats! We will create a special flair for you!

**Season 2 News**

* Season 2 has reportedly been ordered for a full series 22-24 episodes but nothing has been officially announced yet except for the fact that it has been renewed. 

* [Mark Consuelos](http://deadline.com/2017/04/mark-consuelos-cast-riverdale-season-2-suits-dule-hill-1202077582/) has been cast as Hiram Lodge as a series regular.

* [Charles Melton](http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/say-hello-to-riverdales-new-reggie.html) has been cast as Reggie Mantle due to Ross Butler's conflicting schedule with 13 Reasons Why.

* [Season 2 will premier in fall 2017](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-fall-schedule-riverdale-dynasty-matchup-moves-1004973) with CW moving the timeslot to Wednesday at 8PM meaning Netflix outisde of US will have new episodes on Thursday.

**Spoiler Period**

* Now that season 1 is over, we have set a spoiler period to which people must have spoiler warning for 2 weeks after the finale. Which means that you can post anything without spoiler tag on /r/riverdale for any Season 1 related going forward from May 25th.


**Fan Poll**

* We also held a few fan poll over the last hiatus and the answers were pretty awesome! Check them out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/riverdale/comments/67zrk4/final_results_for_poll_week/?st=J2RY4BPG sh=f8e0f6cd).

**AMAs**

* I know a lot of people were disappointed when [Cole Sprouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/riverdale/comments/64ovjg/hi_gang_im_cole_sprouse_i_play_forsythe_pendelton/) did a surprise AMA and missed it so we have another one coming up! Check out the [post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/riverdale/comments/6bcq36/trevor_stines_aka_jason_blossom_will_be_doing_an/)

	<TEXT> Hey gang!

A lot of people were upset at missing [Cole Sprouse's](https://www.reddit.com/r/riverdale/comments/64ovjg/hi_gang_im_cole_sprouse_i_play_forsythe_pendelton/) surprise AMA so we have making this announcement so people don't miss the next AMA!

Trevor Stines reached out to us wanting to do an AMA so we coordinated with him to hold the AMA on May 18th which is also the date when Riverdale will also be available on US Netflix!


Prepare your questions for him! Also remember to don't ask too much of a personal question and respect Trevor!


His reddit account will be /u/TrevorStines which he has already [verified](http://imgur.com/RijqQbG) with us! 


**P.S**: THIS IS NOT THE **AMA**, this is just the announcement! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [AoS Spoilers] A nod to the legacy comic book villain? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 09:45:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> During tonight's episode, the [**Superior**](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Superior) described himself as "Machine Designed Only For Killing" which is a nod to [**M.O.D.O.K**](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/M.O.D.O.K._Superior_(Earth-616\)) "Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing!"

Superior in AoS is 1 head controlling all the LMDs like M.O.D.O.K., also M.O.D.O.K.in the comics is also referred to as M.O.D.O.K. Superior.

What do you guys think? This could mean it's a direct nod to the M.O.D.O.K from the comics or this is our MCU version M.O.D.O.K for the timebeing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since Aida has all the Inhumans' powers that they tested, it will be safe to assume that they also tested and gained Hive's powers.

I hope Hive with all the CGI goodness will make an appearance in the Finale! 

[In case people forgot how Hive looked on screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGAxXbz3-Zs)

I know it's highly unlikely because they have to use the budget for Ghost Rider for the finale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am going to hold off on any judgement until I see anymore of it.

While it would be best for Venom to be incorporated into the MCU, if Sony wants to make a standalone with a 1 off film in a horror essence with Venom, we can let them try it.

If they fail, they won't continue but I don't think Marvel will let Sony taint the Spider-Man brand so I hope Marvel will step in if things go south before the movie gets released.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes credits. 

After the patch, I unlocked the Free Vader/Luke

So I tried to upgrade them and it was forwarding me to the Shop to buy more gold which was odd which I had 100k+ and the upgrade only cost 2000

So I played a game and after the game ended, the credits went to 0.


I'll create a support ticket with netmarble.  </TEXT>

Sharing and creating your video is okay as long as you participate in our community! 

As we spoke before as well as many of my mod team has spoken to you, you need to actually interact with the community before just spamming your youtube videos. 

We have spoken to you multiple times, so if you don't want to interact with us and just spam your videos, we will have to unfortunately ban you from /r/riverdale.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah I doubt that Eren's group will reach the castle next week. By next next week Eren's group will reach.

Next week looks to be Christa's episode considering it's titled "Historia" with some Ymir.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the 40th anniversary of Star Wars so instead of creating a short/movie to fill the gap of Episode 6 and Episode 7, they decided to do it with Battlefront II.

Which is smart since people really wanted a campaign storyline for Battlefront II and people wanted to know the bridge between the gap.  </TEXT>
