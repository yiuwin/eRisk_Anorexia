	<TEXT> Yea, like Leonardo DiCaprio preaching environmentalism while traveling around on mega yachts and private jets. Imagine if all the poorest people in the world had first world luxuries. We're talking BILLIONS more people consuming and polluting just like Americans. It's either the entire world have nothing or we just sink and call it a day. Crying about republicans leaves you with a very narrow view on the actual problem. People regardless of their political preferences don't want to give up their luxuries.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, ok. So condoning violence is ok I guess? If you see a camera crew outside your house are you going to go run at them and start punching them? Give me a break, how can you say this doesn't hurt them? The interviewed some great people here and I am not saying that all refugees are bad. But the biggest issue is that they are invaders, not immigrants. Invaders refuse to adapt to the culture and even force their culture on others. Immigrants will accept the culture and change with the nation. There are 2nd generation refugees that still refuse to speak the native language.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please tell me how Mexico can just stop doing business with the United States? US is Mexico's largest trade partner,without the United States Mexico would no longer receive automobiles, computers, medical supplies, the list goes on. It would send the country into a tail spin. Look how well Cuba did over the years without US trade. Mexico trades with the US at around 10x more than their second largest trade partner (Canada). If you think Mexico, which is already a country with immense poverty would be just fine, you are wrong my friend. 

I do say I love the typical liberal name calling though. It comes down to a an inferiority complex the left has. The one thing that will make them feel better about themselves.  </TEXT>

Heres a great video showing a police officer refusing to go into an area with a camera crew. So yes, there are areas where police will refuse to go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry but you can't just stop doing business with the United States. The world is unfortunately reliant on its number one economy. I know it sounds good in your head, but the world doesn't think like this little hive of group think on Reddit. I know it may hurt your feelings, I know it may not be what your teachers have been telling you your entire life, but instead of calling for the impeachment of a president that the country voted for, the Democratic Party needs to look at themselves and wonder what caused this to happen to happen in the first place. Running around crying racism and posting the same "Iowa congressman says it's time to impeach trump", or "experts agree: aging presidents need to undergo mental evaluations" posts isn't helping your cause.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Investing is long term and you should never invest without an expectation that markets are going to heavily fluctuate. It has happened throughout all of history. Just because a market is down doesn't mean that you stop buying. They did a test of 23 year purchase periods and every single test showed a profit either at the close of the purchase period or within 5 years thereafter through dollar cost averaging. Average profits at the end of these 23 periods was 21.5%. The sky is not falling. Slow and steady wins the race. The market has still been far more overvalued at many other points in the past than it is today.  </TEXT>
