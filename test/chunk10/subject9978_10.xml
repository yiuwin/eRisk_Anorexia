	<TEXT> Yep, I own one just like it for measuring the thickness of the sides of bowls as I work on them.  They can also be tightened in the middle to lock it in place if you want to keep track of a particular thickness.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shhh...don't tell the OP, but this approach also moves the conversation away from feeding an unknown item to a dog to identifying something with a known list of ingredients.  Then it's up to the OP to decide how much research they want to do about the list of ingredients before giving to their dog.  It doesn't matter if it's actually a CS tea, as long as the OP finds a CS tea that smells similar - the question isn't "definitively ID this tea", it's "can I find a tea my dog likes to smell".   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It looks like a Celestial Seasonings tea bag.  The contents look herbal rather than true tea.  Herbal teas are CS's specialty. Sniff some CS tea boxes at the store and see if you recognize the smell.  Try their most popular ones like Sleepytime first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is this from a soldier?  It was standard practice during wartimes for mail to be reviewed and censored to ensure sensitive information wasn't sent back home.  It was one of my grandfather's duties for a while during WWII.   </TEXT>
