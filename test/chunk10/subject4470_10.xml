I know, as libertarians they aren't bound rigidly to one side or the other, but Penn expressing that about Trump, resonates more with me than say, an Elizabeth Warren, for instance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gonna piggyback on your comment for visibility. Hope you don't mind too much


The last month, or so, as the drama has been building, I've commented several times in support of malgoya, but after spending quite a bit of time here on this post mulling over all these new revelations and what to make of them, I've come to a conclusion. Honestly, I could probably tolerate it all, maybe even, continue to sympathize with the guy, if there was any sense that this posted "confession" was indeed made as a means to repent. But, I don't feel like he is remorseful, or that he feels that he could have taken advantage of his position of power (even in the slightest), and this is what troubles me the most. The way he treated the user [mrspremise](http://archive.is/snFDf) and the situation that occurred over at /r/EarthPorn to get him banned, settled it for me. 

This sub is awesome, but there is a really bad taste in my mouth knowing that someone that can manipulate others so seemingly free of guilt, is pretty much the only one running this sub. I really hope things can fix themselves, though. Or someone creates another sub of similar content.


You may have meant well /u/malgoya, but you got caught handcrafting some shady shit, and everytime you get caught, you don't seem all that sincere at a solid reconciliation. I wish this place well, and hopefully things can get better...but for the time-being, I'm over it.


Unsubscribed. Peace. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, that's it! I just edited my comment with a comparative [screenshot](http://prntscr.com/f572qm) and I'm not so sure the two locales (OP's and the movie's) are the same anymore. Thanks for the info;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a movie with George Clooney that came out a few years ago called, *The Descendants*, that takes place in Hawaii. And I swear, there are a couple scenes that take place in the movie that were filmed from that exact spot, or at least, it looks the same. From that same perspective of looking overhead, towards the coast. The location actually plays a pretty important part to the plot of the movie. Really nice looking locale, and photo!


E: So, I decided to look for this particular scene (it's only one; I thought maybe it was a couple) and it looks kinda similar, but I'm not so sure this is the location. It could be, but the angles are different. [From the movie](http://prntscr.com/f572qm) and [OP's photo](http://i.imgur.com/9ojZDZk.jpg) </TEXT>
