	<TEXT> It made it so easy to travel! Not checking luggage is wonderful. It made plane, buses, cars, etc, very easy to get around in. My carpools were all pleasantly surprised at my lack of luggage. There was a time or two I had wished I brought more socks, because everything had to air dry and I did laundry every 4-5 days, but it was worth not having the extra weight. I did this 2 years ago for an 8 week trip and the hardest part is not picking up souvenirs!! Makes flying domestically (no baggage claim) a breeze too. :) </TEXT>

Depending on if it's a bigger order (over $100) or simple artwork, I'll throw the buyer a bone and do a basic proof, but I wouldn't recommend, like others have said here, investing much time or energy in a potential sale vs an actual sale.  </TEXT>

My better half teaches in a town about 20 mins outside the city and the district, principal, dept, and fellow teachers are all wonderful to both him and to me (I substitute occasionally). We make more than the state we came from too, I believe you can find the chart online. Starts at 34k with a bachelor's and no experience (increases with experience and masters credits). We might stay forever because we've heard horror stories of other districts and this one has been a dream! Good luck to you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! I'm looking for ideas for recipes like [this](http://ifoodreal.com/clean-baked-banana-nut-oatmeal-bars/) to make for my better half because for some reason, his schedule allows for him to each his "lunch" at either 10am or 4pm.  He does have a few minutes between classes to snag a snack, though, and I thought it might be nice to pack a few "lunches" that consist of 5-6  small easy-quick-to-eat, not-a-big-mess snacks.  These bars I could make a bunch in advance, other than that I'll try to throw fruit or something in as well.  Any suggestions greatly appreciated! :) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yo, ladies, about time for a meetup! Stem Ciders seemed like a good choice because they offer a variety of dry ciders. "Dry" as in, you can drink more than a sip without it being too sweet! They're really well done. 

I can bring games again if ya want. 6 Nimmt is always a good one, any other easy-to-learn stuff might be good as well! Who's got suspend? And, as always, if anyone wants to euchre, I'm all hands in....

ALSO OF NOTE, a certain Denver lady is in town after a leave of absence so this seemed like a perfect excuse to meet. ;)

	<TITLE> Calling all Denver ladies! Bookmark May 14th on your calendars. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-01 21:12:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's been a while since the last meetup.  We're planning to do a little get together with the ladies of Denver at Bicycle cafe.  We do have our secret little subreddit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/denverwomen) as well as a facebook group [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1017805674912603/), for those of you that would like to join either of those outlets.  There are a couple barriers to entry for privacy's sake, but please don't be discouraged!

This shindig will take place May 14th.  More details on our sub and our facebook group.  [Event details here](https://www.facebook.com/events/789071601199805/)

This is just a simple meet and greet.  I will be bringing a board game or two, in case there's a couple nerds out there.  No knowledge required...no redditing required either.  If your other half would like to meet other ladies, please pass the invite along.  Hoping to meet some cool people!

If you wouldn't mind throwing an upvote my way for the sake of visibility, that would be much appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> maybe try looking for an au pair.  [www.aupairworld.net](http://www.aupairworld.net). many times you can get someone who will pay their own airfare, you'd just have a live-in and pay a meager salary of ~$100/week. i know i worked for 50/60 per week a few years ago. most are looking for the experience of living abroad. </TEXT>
