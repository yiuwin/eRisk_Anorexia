	<TEXT> Hey man, what are you going on about? Maybe you should double check who writes what in the comments. I havent said anything about your knowledge of art.

This drawing in short is about self-imposed bounderies and fears, letting small and trivial things controll you.

The drawing is a product of my mind yes, but the topic is something else. I really don't see the problem here :P </TEXT>

Drew a weird giraffe in a moment of rage after I had been cut of from an internet providers phone support (after a long waiting time)
Looked kind of cool, kept on drawing little creatures over and over again every morning 7am for a year straight. 
Then it sort of became a part of me and now I can't stop.  </TEXT>

Hope you like it :)
