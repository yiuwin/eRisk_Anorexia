	<TEXT> YES. I have always had OCD, but it was not until I started taking Vyvanse for ADD that my eating disorder developed. It is 100% the reason why I began obsessing over food, diet, exercise, etc. It is a major stimulant that, at least for me, raised my anxiety and obsession over things. I also used it as a weight loss pill and I seriously regret ever taking it. I would strongly recommend to get off of it as soon as possible. For me at least, the longer I was on Vyvanse the worse my ED symptoms became.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure it affects body hair all over. I did experience hair loss or lack of growth from all areas of my body, not counting the lanugo (fine hair that grows to keep your body warm when extremely malnourished). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've experienced a lot of this too. A few times my family has even made fun of me for eating a lot of food and they know its because of my binging/purging. It used to really get to me and depress me but now I realize they just have no clue what they're talking about- you've got to consider the source.  You kinda just have to accept most people don't understand. It sucks- I feel like if they did, they wouldn't yell at us about it and instead maybe have a little more compassion. 
But yeah I get how you feel- in the moment, binging makes me feel so much better. It used to instantly improve my mood and I wouldn't have to worry about the things that cause me so much pain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trust me, it is all a distortion. There is no way 2.4 pounds (most of which is likely water/actual food weight, not fat) would give you the excess you describe as fat hanging on you.

I went through a phase where I would eat something (even a "safe" food) and then go look in the mirror and i swore my face appeared 5 times larger than before and I was wrong. I would go back 2 hours later and think to myself how embarrassed I was for losing weight so quickly and how everyone must know something is wrong.. Point is It's all in our heads and is not reality.

You're experiencing body dysmorphia, which is terrible and I feel for you. But please know NO ONE else is going to notice a 2.4 increase on the scale on you.  </TEXT>
