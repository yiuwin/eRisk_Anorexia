	<TEXT> Now judging from your post, it may be a bit advanced, but a really good book that somewhat goes in to the physics of tonality and harmony, taking different timbre and overtones in to account, and the explains chord tension in a very general way, is Vincent Persichetti's "Twentieth Century Harmony".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! For our finals in Japanese (third year) we need to speak in front of the class! I've written a manuscript, but I'm sure my grammar is off in a few (or many) places. If anyone could read through it and give some suggestions on how to fix it while changing as little as possible (and preferably within the next few hours but at least about 20 hours) that would be totally awesome!

Now I know I don't use kanji in all places I could have, but that's because I only use the kanji that we have gone trough in class!

Thank you very much!

**UPDATE: My teacher looked trough it and fixed it for me! Thank you anyway (for upvotes or something, idk)**

	<TEXT> Living in Sweden, one of the worlds most secularised countries, some theologians have this theory that most of us are religious, but do not believe in any "god". 

Religion consists of a few things; a religions should answer the questions: "How should i live my life?" and "What's the purpose of my life". A religion should also contain rituals. (There is more to it than that, but let's keep it simple.)

So, how should a Swede liv their life? Well, just look at society. You can follow the flow, or purposely brake the flow. Either way you have a guideline to relate to/against. 

What's the purpose of life then? Well this is different for many people. Personally, I don't care if I have a purpose or not, so I don't bother with finding it out (because if you look at history, every time someone thinks they have figured everything out, there have been others that are convinced that they are wrong at there is another meaning of life, or the same first group of people have changes their mind later down history's path.)

Lastly, rituals. Well, we have lot's of personal rituals that many follow every day! Brush your teeth, say hello to the bus driver. Sit in that specific seat. By your cup of coffee and so on. 

So basically, we all belong to our personal religions. 

(Other dudes with more knowledge about this theory can explain it better than me, but this was my shot at it.) :)

Edit:
If I remember my statistics correctly, most Swedes don't believe in an god, but do believe in "higher powers" that affect us in some way we not yet have discovered trough science. 
Personally, I believe that there are a lot of interesting finds to be made about reality when it comes to unexplored areas of quantum physics! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really deep but very very good! You need some understanding before you get in to it, but it's very eye-opening (for me anyway). It's more about harmonic quality and how to approach harmony from a tension perspective. Then it gets in to polychords and all sorts of stuff! It's not atonal per say, but some would maybe say that it is (at least in the beginning)

Can't recommend these books more!

Edit:
Also, google about Karlheinz Stockhausen, Arnold Schnberg, Anton Webern and Goeyvaerts and total serlialism, cool shit

Also, idk what it's called in english but there is a theory about how different keys have different affection-qualities. Like how many people throughout history have used F major for nature and grass and stuff and Eb minor for death and stuff while A minor is very passionate and stuff (I may have mixed some of these up) </TEXT>

Twentieth century harmony by Vincent Persichetti and Beyond functional harmony By Wayne Naus!
