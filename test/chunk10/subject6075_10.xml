	<TEXT> Good question, I'm an artist and I've always considered my art to be dark in nature, especially since I usually wouldn't make art unless I felt some kind of way. Well I started painting two years ago and a close friend pointed out that in every single piece there is a small part of it that is light, and happy. Like for example I recently painted an angler fish that was black and creepy but his "lightbulb" was super bright and my background was colorful swirls. He made me realize that though I'm expressing the dark side of my personality, there is also an untapped bright and happy side of me that wants to get out. I never even thought of it as expressing myself either, just creating things I like. Since I realized that my art is 1000x better and I'm happier! So yeah I never noticed that about my art. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A daughter goes up to her father and says "dad can I borrow 20$?" He looks at her and says
 "you know what to do" so she gets down on her knees as he undoes his pants. She about to go down but recoils immediately and says, "your dick smells like shit!" 
Dad: oh yeah your brother needed to borrow the car".;P </TEXT>
