	<TEXT> Lmao I don't wanna attack the guy physically or verbally, it'll probably only make me look like a loose cannon or something.

Seriously though, I try and be as nice as I can but anytime I do he doesn't seem to be in any way appreciative. I sorta get the impression that if I'm too nice to him he'll only end up being more disrespectful and get even worse, almost him thinking like he owns me or is better than me, if you catch my drift? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This guy has been gradually getting more grating over the past ~1 year and I know that he doesn't like me.
I'm in the equivalent of high school and I only see him in school, he doesn't seem to hang around with any of my other friends outside of school.
I'm willing to be civil with him and I don't escalate things but he's getting more confrontational (nothing serious) and this is getting on my nerves.
He does things like say my name over and over and is just generally condescending not only to me but to other people as well.

How can I deal with this guy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm having trouble getting my question across right, I'll try and word it as clearly as I can.

Throughout the series we see/hear of tons of people whose family name is Lannister (Lancel,Kevan,Martyn,Willem,Orson). 

The relatives that we see of the Starks, for example, are mainly the Tullys. 
How come there is no mention of say, cousins of the Stark's who were born a Stark and didn't become the Stark's relatives through marriage. </TEXT>
