	<TEXT> I don't think wealth necessarily has much to do with it although I'm not an expert, but there are a couple things.

1. Smaller countries are probably easier to manage. Less people easier to facilitate coverage for. The government's aren't as bloated as the US's in terms of spending. They have to be more efficient to meet demands for healthcare. 

2. Smaller countries have less of a diverse demographic in terms of income, culture, etc. Think about how big America is compared to a country like Denmark. Denmark is roughly the size of JUST Eastern North Carolina in acreage. If the government only had to run insurance for a state like Florida or similar size it would be easy and probably efficient. Now extrapolate that same size government to the entire United States. Would likely be highly inefficient.
Also people on the coasts compared to people in the Midwest may have different health care needs. 

3. The U.S. has (statistically) the best hospitals in the world. Why? Because we pay the best doctors the best salaries. You get into fully government run healthcare and those salaries go down and maybe some foreign and domestic doctors don't work here and go somewhere where they get paid better. 

Out of the 20 best hospitals in the WORLD the U.S. has 17 of them. http://hospitals.webometrics.info/en/World

That's not a coincidence.

I'm honesty rushing to go on vacation right now so i don't have time to think or type more about it. However I'm open to continue a conversation about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not against social policies. Liberals think that all conservatives hate socialism and social policies. However time after time the government proves they are highly inefficient and ineffective and the VA is an example of completely government run health care. 

Look at the USPS. Before they had any competitors it was awfully inefficient. Letters were always being long, shipping took a long time, etc. UPS and FedEx start competing now most mail is efficiently delivered and we have 2-day shipping. 

We still need social policies. I'm for planned parenthood funding as I believe giving women access to birth control would reduce the number of abortions in the U.S., but government run healthcare doesn't work now in the VA and the left wants to extrapolate over the whole country. No thanks

Edit: I'm here to have a reasonable conversation. Why the downvotes?

Edit2: Everyone is making really great points and I'm trying to respond to as many as I can. </TEXT>

-Ends tax penalties, under the original Affordable Care Act, for individuals who dont buy insurance coverage and larger employers who dont offer coverage. Instead, insurers would apply a 30 percent surcharge to customers who've let coverage lapse for more than 63 days in the past year.

-Ends tax increases on higher-earning people and a range of industry groups including insurers, drug makers and medical device manufacturers.

-Cuts the Medicaid program for low-income people and lets states impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients. Forbids states that haven't already expanded Medicaid to do so. Changes Medicaid from an open-ended program that covers beneficiaries' costs to one that gives states fixed amounts of money annually.


-Overhauls insurance subsidy system from one based largely on incomes and premium costs to a system of tax credits. The credits would rise with customers ages and, like the subsidies, could be used toward premium costs.

-Lets states get federal waivers allowing insurers to charge older customers higher premiums than younger ones by as much as they'd like. Obama's law limits the difference to a 3-1 ratio. States also can get waivers exempting insurers from providing consumers with required coverage of specified health services, and from Obama's prohibition against insurers charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing health problems, but only if the person has had a gap in insurance coverage.

-States could only get the latter waivers if they have mechanisms like high-risk pools that are supposed to help cover people with serious, expensive-to-treat diseases. A newly added provision would give another $8 billion over five years to help states finance their high-risk pools. Despite criticism that the waivers strip protections, House Speaker Paul Ryans office maintains that since states that take the waivers would have to set up the high-risk pools, insurance companies cannot deny you coverage based on pre-existing conditions.

-Blocks federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year.

-Retains requirement that family policies cover grown children to age 26. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gorsuch requiring the nuclear option was hardly Trumps fault. Gorsuch is more than qualified, was approved to be in his previous circuit with 100% of the votes (D and R), agreed with his fellow circuit judges 99% of the time. He just has the wrong letter next to his voter registration card.

Withdrawing from the TPP was a very good idea. You are in the minority for that one, D or R. Bernie ran on no TPP as well. 

NK and China on the table? China has already been sending back shipments of NK coal and established tougher sanctions against them. I  don't know what you mean by "still on the table"

He signed the executive order to ban foreign lobbying. I don't understand what you mean. If people break the law that's their fault, not Trump's. 

I'm giving you accomplishments and you are moving the goal post by saying things like "Gorsuch required the nuclear option" and "haha at the thought of actually banning foreign lobbying". That's like if I asked you to name 1 Obama accomplishment and you said "obamacare" then I could reply "yea well not 1 republican voted for it". But ok if you want to move goalposts and act like he hasn't done anything fine, but you should try and educate yourself instead of just sitting in your echo chamber. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started a Roth IRA account last year and maxed it out. I currently have about $6500 in it. I'm looking at buying index funds through Vanguard. Question is, if I use my $6500 to invest in an index fund, do I have to buy another index fund again when I put more money into it? If I buy the same index fund again does it just put more money into the investments I already bought, or does it purchase new ones? Thanks

	<TEXT> The funny thing about you liberals is that you change your stances based on what your candidate thinks.  I am conservative and I voted for Trump.  I am pro abortion pro gay marriage and I am getting a graduate degree in natural resource management.  I don't agree with Trump's climate change stance, but that is ok I don't have to agree with everything the person I voted for says. 

Cutting the budget for the national parks

It is also funny how liberals think throwing money at a problem is automatically the answer. Oh, Trump wants to cut the budget for the national parks he must hate national parks! No, maybe they are not being efficient with their money and are spending it wastefully because they have a surplus.  I have friends that work in national park service and they buy $1000 desk chairs because if they don't use their budget money they lose it for the next fiscal year.  Look at Barack Obama's throwing money at the US education system.  He added an additional $5 billion to their budget and look where that got him.  The Department of Education just came out with a study that said the money Obama spent on education was 100% waste and the money did not help at all.
http://www.maciverinstitute.com/2017/01/study-obama-department-of-education-effort-spent-7-billion-saw-no-results/

So Obama is more for education than other presidents because he added to their budget right?
Or maybe liberals add to budgets without requiring any type of increase in quality.

 that isn't even being built with American steel

So you are against coal, but for American Steel.... You do realize that coal is required to make steel right?  It is hard to make steel in America when we have to import all of our coal.  A very small % of coal goes to creating electricity.

Just another sheep driven by the left...... wake up bro </TEXT>
