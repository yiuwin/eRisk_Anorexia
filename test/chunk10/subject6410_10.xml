	<TITLE> When was the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus destroyed? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-19 04:53:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The sources on this matter seem to be a little ambiguous. Jordanes says it was destroyed by the Goths in the 3rd century with its remains used to build new Roman infrastructure but later sources such as Cyril of Alexandria and Proclus of Constantinople allude that it was St John Chrysostom that was responsible.

At the moment, the most plausible explanation to me is that the temple was destroyed by the Goths but the cult continued to exist and it was the cult which St John had put and end to. 

Are there any other sources which shed more light on this?

Have you read any of the Legends novels? If so, what would you like to see future authors take from them and put into the new canon?

Cheers from Australia! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What if StarKiller base was not destroyed in TFA? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-02 04:41:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am aware of the criticisms Starkiller has received since TFA came out. However a thought crossed my mind that i think would have made the concept work better.

Lets say the Resistance still assaulted StarKiller base and all the main stuff still happened, but in the end, the assault failed and Poe and Co had to retreat. The end of the movie therefore would have a greater cliffhanger now that the good guys have failed and the future seeming uncertain. Then as the last scene goes to show Luke and Rey, the audience now understands that they now have an even greater importance in the story since their roles would be instrumental in bringing about the destruction of StarKiller and the FO.

Also, i think that this would make StarKiller "even more" different to the Death Star in the sense that it could not be destroyed by an assault. And furthermore, the First Order is not just some nerfed toddler of the Empire of old.

Finally, this would also make the film much less similar to ANH which had a more happier ending than the one proposed here.

What are your thoughts? would a failed assault on starkiller have worked better for the movie? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a rule, i overlook those minor details. Especially since im not well versed in astrophysics. But when somebody asks, ill say that something like the hyperdrive's computer RAM will overload when in contact with space disturbances like black holes. Then a BSOD will display on the console and give you the option to re-boot. Or something else that i make up on the spot that makes no sense </TEXT>
