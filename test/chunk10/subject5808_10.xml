	<TEXT> The Hamburg Police were extremely helpful in helping our hostel room after we got robbed. He (the thief) actually tossed my passport away before being caught so someone (another thief) could go pick it up later, the detective in charge actually went looking on her own time for it after they couldn't find it in all the other goods the thief had. I really was so distraught and she just made the whole thing so much more pleasant     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Guys. I'm a live sound technician from Melbourne, Australia with 10 years experience in Front of House mixing for local and international bands. Essentially, I'm moving to the USA next year for about a year and want to cut my teeth out on some of the smaller venues in Memphis.

I was wondering if there's a list of 100-200 capacity venues that you guys help provide me with in regards to coming and doing some work

Cheers legends  </TEXT>
