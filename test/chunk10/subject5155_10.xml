	<TEXT> Yeah, but it won't be worth your time. Remember that even if you totally kill the markets and get a 20% return, that's just 20 bucks in actual profit. Your *time* is probably better spent doing something else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, this happens all the time. A few thoughts:

1. It's good practice to write this stuff yourself, so you know how it works!
2. This kind of mishap (trying to reinvent the wheel) will slow you down greatly at work. Beware. Hand-rolling your own libraries takes forever, and chances are that other tools are better-developed.
3. Consequently, it's a good idea to do your research thoroughly before starting. Not just so you can find tools that you can use instead of needing to write them yourself, but also so you can *understand* pitfalls and limitations of approaches, should you choose to write a custom tool. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Full disclosure: I used to work at Quantopian.

Answer: not really. For a start, maybe there's Quantconnect, which is vaguely similar to Quantopian. But in any case, you would expect the results of your backtest to be the same, unless different markets data was used for some reason. But I can assure you that the quality of Quantopian's data is good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We use "less" for continuous quantities, and "fewer" for discrete quantities. This distinction between continuous and discrete is valuable, and subverting it sacrifices clarity. You can, of course, subvert it because there's no central authority to tell you off, but you're ultimately just making it harder for others to parse your statements. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> cProfile is mostly for profiling test cases; it does not provide on-the-fly profiling while running your program in production. 

For example, suppose you're running a Python backend on a server, and you're noticing performance issues at times, but your codebase is so large that you're not sure where the performance issues are originating. This tool will help you find the functions calls that are taking too long.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I needed to profile some function calls in a production setting, so I wrote this module to record counts of function calls, as well as their execution times. I'm hoping that you might find it useful!

I'm also looking for some feedback: for example, whether there are any useful features that I could add. Maybe I could add a warning if function calls start taking too much time? I am interested in your opinions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know. I disagree with this position. Here's a summary of my views:

- Project Euler problems provide some internal value to the solver. The feeling of reward from solving a PE problem is not diminished by existing solutions. If you want to solve the problems fair-and-square, don't look at the solutions.

- Project Euler problems provide external value to the solver, i.e. the solver is able to say "I solved these problems" and use that as a credential. I think this is a minor benefit that is strongly outweighed by the educational usefulness of having solutions freely available, both for people who have and have not solved the problems.  </TEXT>

We're not talking about actually flipping the bar around the horizontal axis by 180 degrees like OP, right? </TEXT>
