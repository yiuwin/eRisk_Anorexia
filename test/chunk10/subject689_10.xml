	<TEXT> No questions. I just wanted to say thank you. When I was 1st introduced to your band (Your Clint Eastwood music video on MTV back when MTV was good...) I was in a bad place. A high schooler that just couldn't fit in. Your music made me realize you don't have to fit in and it's ok to be a little weird. Thanks guys! Can't wait to see you in Detroit! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Scene: Laundromat. Dusk.

The setting sun gave way to the occasional glistening of a washer door being closed. Steven Liftnitski (u/_Dark_secrets) frantically loads his clothes into one of the machines in the corner. Being a redditer, there is no other option. As he quickly throws his sullied clothes from a previous laundromat encounter into Jasmin, (that's the washing machines name) he notices a glimmer out of the corner of his eye.
