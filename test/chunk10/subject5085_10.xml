	<TEXT> Some people have said they want it removed because so many subreddits do it badly, though they can just disable it for themselves in that case. Others have agreed with the problems of having totally different user experiences on desktop and mobile.

Hopefully reddit's new system of implementing the important stuff (the stuff CSS is commonly used for) with "widgets" that work on both desktop and mobile, and still allowing some CSS customization on top of that, will address those problems while letting mods make their subreddits look good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It wasn't *that* unfair, though the unnecessary 2-line layout of the puzzle may have added to the confusion.

There were 3 patterns in the puzzle:

* The circle around the outside pattern alternated between being there and not (1 had a circle around the outside, 2 didn't, 3 did, 4 didn't, 5 did), so the answer had to have no circle around it - based on just that pattern, you could rule out red and green

* The triangle rotated 90 degrees left each time (it pointed down in 1, right in 2, up in 3, left in 4, and down again in 5), so the answer had to have it pointing right - based on just this, you could also rule out red and green

* Finally, of course, the dots were the Fibonacci sequence (1 had 1 dot by the triangle, 2 also had 1 dot, 3 had 2 dots, 4 had 3 dots, 5 had 5 dots), so the answer had to have 8 dots - based on just this pattern, you could solve the puzzle, since only yellow had 8 dots

Either of the first two patterns still leave the choice between yellow and black, but you at least had a 50/50 shot. You could solve the puzzle knowing the Fibonacci sequence alone.

I quickly noticed the first two patterns, but wasn't sure about the pattern of the dots until she revealed the name of the puzzle. In a real escape room, this would probably be a pretty standard/easy puzzle. Even without actually knowing about the Fibonacci sequence beforehand, it's definitely possible to work out that the number of dots in each item is the sum of the dots in the previous 2. </TEXT>

Yeah, I already discovered this when someone linked to a thread from a profile post (while it was still in the limited beta), and TotesMessenger included that link in its comment.

 Fun fact, it won't show up as a regular post, but will show up if it's an announcement. Check my profile.

	<TEXT> By being added as a mod of the "profile". (The beta profiles basically function like subreddits.)

According to /u/Drunken_Economist, this isn't entirely intentional:

 It's true (in fact, my wife noticed this and posted to my profile), but it's not really a supported feature  it won't show in the listing and there's just generally some unexpected behavior. Just a quirk of the beta </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. From /u/Deimorz's comment [elsewhere in the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/comments/6bsmbk/beta_bug_my_posts_and_comments_have_disappeared/dhp8xyq/?context=3), in response to speculation that the code for the beta profile "subreddits" is the same as for regular subreddits:

  My guess is the backend uses the same code to run user profiles as they do to run subreddits

 Yeah, they do. The "user profile" you can post to is really just a subreddit starting with "u_" and then your username. So in your case your profile subreddit is /r/u_aranea_highwind </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm thinking of ditching this account now too because it's so easy to sort the comments now. I was pretty cringy 3 years ago, and while I know it was always up there anyway, I don't like that content from that long ago is that easy to find.

Uh... It always was easy to find.

That said, I do agree about the difficulty/annoyance of being unable to restrict others from commenting on your profile posts. </TEXT>

Also: this isn't Myspace.

	<TEXT> I still didn't like one aspect of it: while Peyton rejects Blaine, it's only because Liv could have taken the cure sooner. There's no mention of Blaine's history as a con artist (particularly him sleeping with her under false pretenses the first time), or the many people he's murdered, etc. At least last night's episode brought up some of that. </TEXT>

The fact he's willing to blow up the entire compound to prevent Henry from returning to Veil really does it for me. How do you feel about this scenario? Do you think he's gone too far even for Quinn? or is this all completely justified?

Quinn's nuts, and he always has been. He's an entertaining villain, but he's never been sympathetic. </TEXT>

 The wars were so long ago, nobody even remembers.

 Darkness and fear ruled until the time of the barons, seven men and women who forged order out of chaos. People flocked to them for protection.

 That protection became servitude. They banished guns and trained armies of lethal fighters they called Clippers.

 This world is built on blood. Nobody is innocent here.

	<TEXT> Assuming you mean you want to filter posts by users below a certain amount of karma, you could use pretty much the same rule with a slight change.

For comment karma: https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/wiki/library#wiki_troll_prevention

    ---
    author:
        comment_karma: " -50"
    action: remove

To restrict posting based on the user's post karma (aka link karma), just change `comment_karma` to `post_karma`:

    ---
    author:
        post_karma: " -50"
    action: remove

(You can also use `combined_karma` instead if you want that. See the [full documentation](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/automoderator/full-documentation#wiki_karma.2Fage_threshold_checks) for more details.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good feature to have... but there are a few kinks to be worked out.

Right now, with image uploads as submissions, the image can be deleted by deleting the original submission where you uploaded the image. How would this work for comments? In particular, I ask because comments can be edited (unlike link submissions). As such, there'd be no permanent association between the image and the specific comment. What if the comment was edited to remove the link? Would that automatically delete the image from reddit's servers?

Not an insurmountable problem to solve, but one to be considered. Perhaps the image could be a separate object associated with the comment, that could not be edited, only optionally deleted separately from the comment? I dunno, I'm just brainstorming ideas. </TEXT>
