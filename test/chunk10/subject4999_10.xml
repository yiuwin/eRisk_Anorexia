	<TEXT> As many of you know, Roman History has had a significant impact on western history as a whole. The problem is my knowledge of Rome is very limited except for around the time of christ. How do I go about leaning more about Roman history? I know there are primary sources such as Caesar's "The Conquest of Gaul" and various accounts from Roman historians, but which ones are the best? Are there any good, more modern histories on Rome worth checking out? </TEXT>
