	<TEXT> Why would she be a snake from the waist down? I mean, I know that how she was depicted in that movie, but not in mythology. The snakes, whether they be originally part of her or not, will not have digestive tracts. They wouldn't get enough to eat for it to be practical. Maybe their parasites who siphon off her blood so they can achieve cellular respiration. Or maybe it's a mutualistic relationship. The snakes take in extra oxygen that goes straight to medusa's heart while at the same time she gives them much needed biochemical energy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Late to this thread, so most likely no one will read this, but here goes nothing. 

I was very manipulative. I thought it made me "cool" to be able to pull strings like that. Now I realize that I was just hurting people who I cared about, and by extension, hurting myself. Slowly, people will alienate themselves from you, even if they never figure out that you were manipulating them. 

Pretending to be a sociopath may feel good in the short term, but eventually even you will feel the pain you brought others.  </TEXT>
