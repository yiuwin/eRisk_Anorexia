	<TEXT> The best I could find was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/2s8025/why_is_pete_portrayed_as_a_being_a_potential/) thread discussing my point, but it's nothing great and I can't find anything in the pilot's script yet to back me up. 

I don't think it's a solid example.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spoilers for all shows ever. 

Not in terms of a character naturally evolving, but writers having an idea for a character's direction early on and eventually going, "Nah, doesn't work as well." 

I considered Phillip from The Americans for this, since he seemed more forceful in earlier episodes. But I think the change could be attributed to his ongoing depression and losing faith in his cause. 

* Always Sunny  Dennis, Mac and Charlie were all originally manchildren trying to run a bar, do stupid shit and get laid. Dennis became a psychopath, Mac turned gay and Charlie became more childlike. That early storyline with Charlie's ex bringing a kid into his life probably wouldn't have happened in later seasons, or at least not the same way. 
* Mad Men  Pete Campbell originally seemed he could be a future threat to Don, based on his ambition in the pilot and a few remarks made by others (Roger, I think). He showed no real promise of this later. 
* Community  Abed seemed less robotic in early episodes.  </TEXT>

What about "'progress' being destroyed" do you see as beneficial for our society?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love when people text me these intense bursts of ideas, thoughts or specific emotions associated with something. I always feel in text I'm more involved in communicating than others, but person-to-person others see me as the aloof one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like a moron to me. She reacts to his presidency like reality can be spun from some blockbuster narrative. No "rebirth" will come from this. We're just going to slow or reverse our progress for a while.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  He told the waiter who then accused him of lying to get a free meal because "we have nothing like this in the kitchen". 

To be fair, that's what it sounds like at first glance. No one at the restaurant would have been like, "Oh one of the wing nuts on the Rolodex must have fallen off."  </TEXT>
