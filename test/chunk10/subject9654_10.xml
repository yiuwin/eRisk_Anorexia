	<TEXT> yeah it's slightly diffrent here.

My comment was meant to mean the banks are playing a long con here like they did in the us in 2007.

They are hoping the bubble bursts.
even if the prices retract 20 percent which is the estimation they will still make out.
meanwhile the rest of the market will shit itself here from the onflow and lots of ppl will lose jobs.
Construction sector will pretty much die.

and ppl with 2 million dollar homes who can't afford it now.
then have to give the home to the banks who then sell it for 100s of k more than they  gave the loan for.

As of today it's something like a  250 billion dollar loan market with only like 9 million home loans so yeah do the maths.
Theres a lot of bullshittery going on 
specialy when they give out loans to a factory worker  on 40k a year and expect them to keep the job when the bubble bursts....

25 percent yeah nah i got a IDCU  backed credit card locked in at 11.5 percent right now till 2019.
it's only a few K i  mainly use it  only when they have like spend 200 get 50  off the product deals going like they had last week </TEXT>

We have close to 5 times  the market  of singapore.
And i can get the same product for 200 less aussie bucks there  than i can here.
We get ripped cause u can't really do anything about it.

Steam got it's ass handed to it though last year when our govt fined them for not honoring returns under australian laws.

Adobe premier for a while was 800 Aud dollars.
yet u put a VPN on and ur in US was like 100 bucks lol. 

but ur not wrong though   wage growth is an issue here.
coffe costs liek 5 bucks now which is a fair chunk.

White goods and everything else is fine.
Cheaper to buy a fridge here than it is in singapore.

But tech is just retarded.
we are still paying like 1200 bucks for a 1080 ti. some places.

ur not one of those ppl who expect it to be priced well and beat a 1080ti are you.

If the video linus showed at CES  was it playing bf1 at  4k over 60hzfps is it then u have nothing to worry about. as that was an ES sample most likely

if it can beat a 1080ti then it will be priced the same.

if it beats a 1080 and is priced less.

	<TEXT> U will hear at computex.
It's near market suicide for them not to.
investors have most likely  been told that's when an annoucment will be.

Most likley computex annoucment for june 16/17 launch as they would want to get some  cash flow for end of the quarter on the books to look good next quarter.

if nothing is shown at Ctex then it's dead to me.
im not going to wait 2 more months when i can get 1080s 20 percent off with the ebay sales right now

I laugh at the comments in this sub though.
No ones been treated bad.

They cant have confirmed anything up to this point.
one as it's  given a free goal to nvidia as then they can  A either drop a revision of the 1080s with improved architecure to nullify vega. B  go oh look heres volta  this is what it can do.
which is what happend.

yes it's been a long time.
But it clearly was not ready for launch and we don't want another 290x fiasco on our hands where it released as a super hot shit driver piece of crap and took 6 months to become good.

However where amd has been a bit of a cunt is the teasing.
Don't do that.
Don't go.
IT"S COMING.
Im coming.
Im coming   and sound like my wife when my next door neighbors over upstairs

they said q2 2017 as long as they make it that's fine.
it just better not be an overpriced hot mess.

	<TEXT> If it's like any previous tech launch and it's launching in  june.
Then it's allready done at this point.
It would just be code  managment and optimization tweaks at software levels.

It takes i think  someone posted  1 week to creat one unit sized batch for average  factory process on a 14nm node.
So you place an order  for  10,000 GTX 1080s  and it will take 1 week to make then ship and store so ur looking at close to 3 weeks for delivery of the chips just to  get them to the AIB  partners.

So it's probably safe to assume people like asus and all that have the chipsets now  to have enough stock come june.

My old company used to  get custom made Process units made on a 22nm system  and it would take anywhere from 1 month to 1 and half months and that's when we  bought in huge allotments of over 12,000 or more at a time  </TEXT>
