	<TEXT> While ED does generally occur in older men, there is scientific evidence that PMO can contribute ED [1]. There is also the testimony of many Fapstranouts who cured ED with NoFap.

Personally, I don't think your comment takes away from what I wrote, but rather adds to it. My post was mostly about ads concerning premature ejaculation, death grip, ED, as well as all the fake dating sites and "women who want sex with you." I think that these ads are trying to cure problems that porn creates/makes worse, for the reasons I say in my post.

Your comment, I take it, is talking about ads based on the promise of penis enlargement and "lasting for hours." Having a small penis and what not are not caused by porn. So I agree with you that in this case the ads try to take advantage of your insecurities and perceived notions about what women want. Although one could argue that porn usage is still causing these issues, by making you feel insecure and giving you an unreal expectation of what sex is and what women want.

Hopefully some of that made sense lol.

	<TEXT> I know that most ads work like how you described, but I've never found any ads on porn websites that weren't related to sex. Have you ever seen any "normal" ads on porn sites? I'm asking anyone since I'm curious. </TEXT>

According to the source, the exact cause of premature ejaculation is unknown. However, the source does say that ED, poor body image, and sex related anxiety are possible contributions to PE (and porn usage can contribute to all these things). There is also testimony from this sub that NoFap helped cure PE. 

Although considering the inadequate (at least for me) amount of scientific evidence here, death grip and the inability to orgasm during real sex would have probably been better examples to use. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that porn actors probably aren't aware of these side effects. However, the companies behind the ads are pretty specific in what they advertise, leading me to conclude that these companies know full well the problems that porn users have.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure the last time you went to a porn site (hopefully it's been a long time) you noticed all the ridiculous ads. While I always knew they were BS, I recently noticed something else; these ads were all promoting a cure to porn induced symptoms.

Take premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction for example. Lots of ads offer pills and secrets to cure these problems. Why are these ads on a porn site? Because these companies know that porn causes these problems, and therefore porn users are going to be looking for cures. 

These ad companies also know that porn users generally have low self confidence and have trouble with women. Hence the ads offering casual partners who want sex just 1.2 miles away. And they don't want just anyway, they want you. Yeah, right. The fake "dating sites" and all the other bullshit are also indicators that these companies are trying to take advantage of people who are desperate for sex.

The industry is actually pretty clever. They sell poison disguised as food, then try and sell a fake antidote. We need to make sure we don't fall into the money trap.  </TEXT>
