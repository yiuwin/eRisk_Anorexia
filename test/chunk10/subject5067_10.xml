	<TEXT> I legit read so much shit about the prisons all around the world and reading something like this is just so fucking awesome. Wish I could upvote this twice, I truly hope this man has a great rest of his life. Life after prison is so hard, you're pretty much isolated for a long time and to make matters worse when you get back into that society you've forgot about it's not even as easy to live in as it is for someone who hasn't been in prison. </TEXT>

(ps. Not bashing anyone lower rank than me just saying that the players might not be good COMPARED TO ME, not that the rank's bad in case someone took long to achieve it or anything. Not bragging either I consider myself below average player ) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah so while writing a paper about Celtic culture I came across Berserkers and the last hour or so I've been reading about them I've just been insanely fascinated. So I've read about this ''trance like state'' Could anyone open this up a bit? How did they reach this state and how would the warriors be raised/chosen etc. Pretty much just anything about Berserkers.

I'd ask more too but I haven't done enough research to ask so any information you have about them will also be greatly appreciated.


Thanks! 
(also no need to link sources if you've lost them or can't find them, don't wanna bother anyone like that, if you have some saved then of course they're welcome too haha)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, so it seems like I either snowball the f*** out of the lane or simply get demolished so, how do I deal with Garen, Darius, Yorick and Mordekaiser.

I'd love to know what masteries runes and summoners you run against those. Darius I can somewhat deal, SOMEWHAT, if he gets phage and boots before me I can't, but that's unlikely, but the others I just can't 

Thanks!

Edit: Also what starting items do you get against them?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yeah, so basically I simply can't come up with a way to defeat any murloc decks, obviously I've won some, but those have been because I've just had pretty much the perfect draw while the guy playing against me has had a shitty one, so I really don't count those.

Not hating on them or anything, I'm just kinda tired always KNOWING that I'll lose.

The two decks I've played mostly are some ''budget'' ones, Jade druid and face hunter (since I'm sorta f2p)

Thanks. </TEXT>

When I did get home I was just completely fucked, no sense of anything.

	<TEXT> Well long story short, Ezreal is a caster and his kit has one pretty big weakness which is short range and not strong enough autoattacks to match the hypercarries that have as short of a range. 
That's not really a problem since Ezreal's q deals with that issues, but if you get crit your q's wont hurt at all and your autoattacks won't be as strong no matter what you build.

So yeah, it's that simple :P  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ----------------I DID READ FAQ--------------------------

Yeah so after finally turning 18 I decided to create a paypal. I buy a lot game related stuff online and this just felt like one of the easiest ways. 
So I was wanting to ask how do charge backs work? I've tried youtube searching and googling but only things that came up were some ''paypal fund creators'' which well.. yeah. Googling resulted in posts from 2013 and surely it's a bit different now? 

So after making a payment is there a certain window (like 1 week or so) where you can charge back the money, and in what cases can I as seller prevent someone from charging back the payment? I read that I shouldn't sell virtual stuff, so in game items etc. but what about stuff such as clothes etc.? 

Thanks for anyone who cares to take time off their day and answer, I bet you get asked this a lot, just wanted to find some relevant information.  </TEXT>

But on my pull day deadlifts and bent over rows work kinda similarly for me, can't do the other one because dl's make me too tired. I just train something else between the 2 ''similar'' movements, so pull day would for example be Dl's, bicep curls, bent over rows etc. 

Not sure if this works for you, I guess you could try preworkouts, even though what I kinda understood from this is that you don't run out of energy but your muscles are just too tired (I get that you could've meant this but I thought that you meant general energy at first) </TEXT>
