Maybe, just maybe we should be building LRT that are above ground to be safe.  Right?

I think it could work.  A transit plan that encompases the whole city but uses the latest technology.  Better than streetcars...

Like a Transit City?

	<TEXT> No they aren't.  We have far too many on Council who get used to the steady gig and it needs to get changed up every now and then.
The only war on the car is in these idiots heads.
THIS is why we do not have proper transit or community housing in this fucking city.
THIS is why we ended up with a FULLY FUNDED TRANSIT PLAN being kicked to the curb and we're now on the fucking hook for billions of dollars in overages.
But hey it's not your tax dollars. right?

Wrong.
Term limits help to keep these idiots from making decisions to keep themselves in POWER by playing it safe.
The status quo is b.s.  This city needs term limits.  NOW. </TEXT>

Some people were thinking it was an attack of some kind.
Pride did the right thing last year (to get the parade to continue) but then this year fucked it all up again and have lost a helluva lot of respect.
