	<TEXT> This is getting REALLY irritating now.

1. Signed up for postal vote in EU Referendum, received polling card on the day of the vote.

2. Signed up for postal vote for General Election, polling card again.

Both times I was confirmed as having a postal vote. First time, was told that I could not have an emergency proxy as I did not fit the criteria, so lost my vote.

I am not voting in the General Election this year, but dammit guys, get a bloody grip and have the system WORK.  </TEXT>

Sweden did go to the embassy in London a couple of times to question him, from what I can recall. Ecuador turned them away, or at least made it difficult for them to question him so they could not. It was only near the end that Ecuador started to be more cooperative.  </TEXT>

I stated to Nintendo I wanted an early copy for review. I then said I was British (whcih I am), but live in Sweden BUT I only work with British sites. At that point, they decided they did not want to work with me and blocked me.

It has always been the larger companies that have been willing to send me games. The day I started up my first site, I was straight on EA's mailing list. I received every single release of theirs on multiple formats for the next 3 years. These were physical copies. I have not really done much since everybody moved over to digital games. 

I did not have a single company that refused to deal with me when I was a smaller business, but now I have a reach that is 30-40x larger than it was before, nobody wants to give me the time of day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back when I got started (2004-ish), I was able to *easily* get review copies for a brand new site, 100ish visitors per day. Every company would respond to me. I had 20+ review copies coming my way each week, all for a small website.

I then got out of the game for a while. I want to get back into games journalism, just to spice my writing life up a bit. However, nobody responds to me. Nintendo of Europe even blocked my email account. Kalypso Media said I could have a review copy then went dead on me. 

Is the traditional website dead? If I really want to score review copies, do I need to produce videos nowadays?

I mean, I can easily buy my own games for review, which is fine. It just seems like a changed industry. </TEXT>

Trump has already stated he is concerned about voter fraud. As a result, I see him suspending elections until the problem is rectified. However, they will be suspended indefinitely. The Trump dynasty will not deal with the problem. They will come up with a line of succession.

At the same time, America will fall. I can see it splitting into two distinct countries with a shared culture.  </TEXT>

The monarch still needs to sign legislation before it becomes the law, and she still needs to choose the PM (she is advised on who to pick). 

In Parliament (the legislature), the PM has just as much power as every other MP in that room on a voting level. </TEXT>

To be fair, a lot of these people I am speaking to have never had a long conversation with somebody in English, so I don't blame them that much! Just cute for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I moved to Sweden from the UK.

Hardest part was saying goodbye to my dog.

Each and every time I went back, I had to say goodbye to my dog, not knowing whether it would be the last time I would see her. She was so happy to see me when I returned, even after a year away. She knew it was me.

Turns out that in March, it was the last time I would ever see my dog. She would not even know it. She was probably still waiting there, right up until she took her final breath, for me to return.  </TEXT>

Yes, black people were involved in the auction. To not include them would be racist. </TEXT>
