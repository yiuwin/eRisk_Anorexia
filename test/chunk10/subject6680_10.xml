	<TEXT> I agree 100% with you. Actually I think if the source code of a closed source code base were to be made open, there would initially be a huge amount of new vulnerabilities discovered as people start reading the code and how it interacts.

So, to state it another way. If someone who never had access to the Linux kernel source code and only have access to a hardened Linux server and a Windows server, the amount of vulnerabilities he would discover on the Linux system would be substantially less as it has already been hardened by not having had its source in obscurity. So the actual vulnerabilities will have to be detected the same way as with Windows by reverse engineering etcetera.

So this site is actually comparing apples with oranges. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would the relatively high amount of vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel compared to the low amount in for instance Redhat Enterprise Linux be due to the fact that a lot of the listed vulnerabilities in the kernel were found in versions of the kernel a few days after it was released?

Also do all the open source code bases have a disadvantage in this list due to security researcher being able to read the code and spot possible vulnerabilities as apposed to doing a variety of possibly some brute force attacks on closed source code bases? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure why you are being down voted. Our current view of what absolutely positively definitely exists in our physical world are all things bounded by an upper bound.

We do not know if the universe is infinite, we can only see up to the known universe. So it is not possible to say that we know there is an infinite amount of protons for instance, we can only say that in what we know about our universe there is x amount of anything (mass, amount of energy generated by turning all mass into energy etc).

However, the paradox is that because we will never be able to see if the universe has an end, even if we lived for eternity in an infinite universe, we will always have an upper bound on everything.

So in our current physical world there really is nothing that comes close to being infinite. Some examples:

* The smallest you can divide a ruler representing a number line is the Planck length. So you cannot divide a 1 meter ruler into a portions for each real number in math between 0 and 1 for instance.
* The smallest amount of time would be the Planck second, the amount of time it takes light to travel a Planck length.
* if you could convert all the matter in the known universe to energy in order to accelerate a proton to the speed of light, you still won't be able to get to exactly c.

	<TEXT>  What I tried before posting here:
 Removing the default Firefox from the 'Favourites' on the activities panel. Then launching the developer edition *and right clicking on its icon in the panel and choosing add to favourites. However clicking the icon just launches the normal Firefox.
 Going in to the defaults at settings, but because it is not installed via a RPM you can not choose it there (it is not in the list and you cannot browse to an executable either).
 Adding an icon to the desktop does not work either as pressing the windows key and typing Firefox ALWAYS brings up the default one.

	<TEXT> Hi, the developer edition of Firefox is not the edition the Firefox devs use to develop Firefox. It is a version of Firefox that contains a lot of useful tools for front end web developers:

https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/

Also not to be rude but I tried all the 'intuitive' ways to try to make it the default (or at least just get it to stick to the activities panel.).

What I tried before posting here:

* Removing the default Firefox from the 'Favourites' on the activities panel. Then launching the developer edition and right clicking on its icon in the panel and choosing add to favourites. However clicking the icon just launches the normal Firefox.

* Adding an icon to the desktop does not work either as pressing the windows key and typing Firefox ALWAYS brings up the default one.

Hence my question (which I am sure you know the answer to right) how can I make it the default for my user and add it to the activities panel? </TEXT>

EDIT 2: http://imgur.com/a/IzeKc Got it like this currently. The icon is in the panel and clicking it starts the correct version of Firefox DE. However the new window is not grouped correctly but creates a new entry on the panel.

	<TEXT> Mathematically a line is a one dimensional object and a point a zero dimensional object. 

Speaking under correction but I recall reading that a photon is dimensionless. Also space doesn't exist from the point of view of a photon as it travels any distance instantaneously from its point of view. Thus if it had for instance a length dimension the front would arrive before the back, that doesn't make sense if time is non existing for it.

	<TEXT> Perfectly valid question. The app handles basic project management and invoicing as well. Due to the exchange rate between my country and the US (with almost all options that will cover all our needs being in USD) it is much, much more cost effective to write it in house.

We could effectively hire 4 full time devs for a year for the same amount of money the yearly maintenance for these products typically is in USD.

And having written it in house it conforms to the current business logic of the business, instead of the current business logic having to change to logic defined by apps. The logic in the of the shelf apps are usually flexible, but again due to not having been written specifically for my country there will invariably be logic enforced by the app that clashes with the actual business logic. This leads to rewriting of business management documents, retraining of personnel etcetera.

What I like most from JSF is Primefaces, it provides a lot of great UI components like the Datatable  component without requiring any custom Javascript. 

Is there something similar to Primefaces (the look and functionality provided by it) that one can use with Spring? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If you were to design a complete new medium business Java web app, which of the following will you choose for server and development environments. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-12 15:48:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all

We have a current enterprise app written in Perl. All the client machines are running windows. The Perl code is riddled with calls to active x components and as such we need to run all clients in IE compatibility mode. There are three sites, linked with 10MBs links. The main site has 300 client PCs and the two satellite sites have 20 client PCs. 

The app is mainly used to book vacation leave, capture employee details and customer / client details.

There are 2 full time developers coding new modules plus maintaining the old Perl app.

The decision was mode to go with Java instead of .NET (of which I am very happy of course).

Now, this is where I require some feedback from this very knowledgeable community. Which of the following server side and development setups would you choose if you had to do this from scratch? If you guys have much better ideas and combos compared to below, please reply with them as well ;)

Constants will be:

* Java 8
* MySQL


For the server OS we were thinking of:

1. CentOS 7 
2. Ubuntu LTS
3. Debian Stable


And for the application server:

1. Wildfly
2. JBoss EAP 7 (given the small production environment, is it worth moving to EAP 7 compared to Wildfly?)
3. Tomcat 8


For frameworks the candidates are:

1. JSF + Primefaces + Hibernate (EAP 7 and Wildfly best suited for this?)
2. Spring MVC + Thymeleaf + Hibernate (Tomcat best suited, or is Wildfly / EAP 7 still better seeing that it is a super set of Tomcat?)


For the development machines:
1. Windows 10 + Intellij
2. Windows 10 + + JBoss Deveopment suite
3. CentOS + Intellij
4. CentOS +  JBoss Deveopment suite
5. Fedora 'current' + Intellij
6. Fedora 'current' + JBoss Deveopment suite

The reason Fedora is an option is that it is relatively close to CentOS, and being current should allow the devs to do other things at times as well besides coding. Or is it by far the best to have the development environment the same as the server?

Really forward to your recommendations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it definitely does blow the mind. The thing is though as I understand it (I may have misread it) space itself curves infinitely at the singularity. Therefore the only difference between a 10 solar mass black hole and a 1 000 000 solar mass black hole is the radius of the event horizon. The actual point inside the event horizon that contains all of this mass are in both cases infinitely small.

	<TEXT> A lot of discussion about future AI and the human race have us uploading our consciousness to the system in order to attain immortality (at least for as long as we can postpone the inevitable death of the universe). 

I assume that one of the requirements would be that your biological body is terminated upon upload (maybe not, but why upload in the first place then?). 

Currently legally it would of course be murder, but the question is, do *you good people of Reddit* think it is murder or immortality? And would you be prepared to do it? </TEXT>

However I also know that my layman's intuition frequently falls very short when conjecturing about mathematics.

	<TEXT> The whole Dyson Sphere theory never made a lot of sense. Why would any civilization capable of doing something like this even bother to do this? There are much, much better ways of getting more than enough energy from multiple stars.

Heck if they have the tech to transport a couple of neighboring systems' materials to build such a sphere, they most probably have the tech to build living environments inside the stars atmospheres that can tap directly of this for energy.

But why would you need all of this energy concentrated at only one star? Why not just expand to other stars if it becomes to crowded where you are, they most definitely have not run out of possible stars to tap in our portion of the milky way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Hardly any cost at all

You are forgetting about all the tools, dies and equipment used to manufacture the new metric sized and labeled things.

Even though the metric system is in principle much easier to learn (you only need to know how to count to a 1000 in most cases) compared to working with fractions, there is still some retraining costs involved.

Just look at these very costly imperial to metric - metric to imperial mistakes made in the past by highly educated scientific teams and engineers...
