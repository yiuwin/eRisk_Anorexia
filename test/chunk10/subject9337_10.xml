	<TEXT> I provoked him but for the first time my boyfriend said my weight was unattractive.  He said something afterward to ease the blow and he tends to lash out without thinking so I don't know how much he meant it.  No one I've been with has ever said I was unattractive in any way before so it feels kind of bad.  I either thought that I wouldn't care or that he would never say anything like that.  Blegh.  I provoked him by saying that a certain behavior was unattractive (he was bashing on someone a bit) so I feel like I kind of deserve it, plus I guess it's nice to know the truth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of this so much. :(  People are super dense.  I've had to ask family members to stop commenting on my body, which is honestly really awkward and hard to do, but sometimes just has to be done.  People really do think they are just being complimentative and need to be told straight up that it's not welcome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah let's only treat people for eating disorders when they are on the brink of death. :)  I don't think your annoyance with the terminology trumps awareness of warning signs and preventative care for eating disorders.  At the worst of my eating disorder when I was passing out daily and hospitalized for mineral deficiency and tachycardia with a BMI of 15, I did not have amenorrhea.  Guess I didn't have an eating disorder.  I get what you're saying but like myself, some people are overweight when their eating disorders start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I average about 1000 net a day.  I drive a lot, exercise kind of a lot and need my brain to be at least somewhat active for school.  I'm also pretty small already and if I drop weight too quickly it will alarm the people close to me.  I make a point to be seen eating normal amounts of food. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I eat above 1000 nearly everyday and I'm definitely disordered.  I knowingly eat at a number that still causes me to slowly lose weight when I don't need to.  Hell, when I had a BMI of 15 I usually never ate below 800 cals.  Never really fasted.  Still ended up hospitalized with many deficiencies.  Still would have eventually keeled over and died if I had kept on like I was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I usually go out looking very plain and wearing baggy clothes.  This in addition to the resting bitch face usually keeps the attention away.  Yesterday, it was very hot out and I wore a crop top.  I got a love letter on my car.  No more crop tops then.  Have to agree with smokesanddietcokes, a lot of guys SAY they like "thicc" girls or whatever but I think just as many or more like very slim girls.

But yeah, dressing down usually works.  I love the idea of only getting attention when I want it (which is not very often) and only then doing makeup and nice clothes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lived in France for a couple months and my food habits honestly were not very different than in the US.  The community of 20 somethings I usually hung out with regularly had candy, pizza, and beer around.  I probably ate more than usual actually, because I wanted to try all the different things I'd never tried before.  Definitely walked more though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of on a similar vein, but there's also some people here that seem to think they speak for everyone who has or has had a restrictive eating disorder.  
Stuff like...
"An anorexic person would never eat that."
Yeah sorry that's not always true.  At a BMI of 15 something I could still trick people into thinking I was eating normally by eating a large meal in front of them.  Not all anorexics sit around counting out individual pieces of cereal or are never seen in public eating a normal amount of food.  It's a very deceitful disorder, not a lifetime movie. </TEXT>
