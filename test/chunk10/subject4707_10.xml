	<TEXT> I've never commented on this sub before but I'm quite intrigued about this situation.

For background, I'm a white male living in the U.K. I do not believe in any higher deity/power, but believe that religious text holds honourable values that everyone should live by (being good to your neighbour, loving one another). Jesus did not need to be a deity in order to be a good man.

Take the lessons you have learnt, but love your life. Your god is a loving one, and as one of his children he would want you to love your life. You do not need to do anything you are unhappy with. This is more than just a relationship issue, it's your mental health. Be happy bro, you do you. Remember, you always have a choice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a big fan of this line up, sad Kodja isn't there though!

We could really do damage to the shitty here. Beating them today and losing against Blackburn could actually put them in the relegation area for the last day. I hate losing, but if it sees them go into League 1 then I really don't care! UTV </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Might not have had the possession we wanted but the points speak for themselves. We have an absolutely brilliant run of form and this is setting us up for a wonderful finish to what started an awful season.

The future does seem bright, finally. UTV

Ps - so glad ipswich scored!! Fuck Birmingham Shitty </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TDEE - Noob Questions! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello Fittit!

Since I've gained the weight I've always wanted, I now want to be more careful on my calorie intake. However, I am unsure how TDEE works and I'm hoping one of you lovely people could help
Me?

I know TDEE is daily expenditure, and on many calculators it's a rough estimate. On here I found the 2suns TDEE calculator which advised me I expend around 2200-2300 calories (based on 74kg body weight) on the spreadsheet.

Now; how does this interact with exercise? 2suns did an AMAZING set of workouts that include volume and strength in all barbell exercises and I'm assuming this will burn a lot of calories. I want to eat in 100 calorie surplus to maintain my body weight and ensure I'm atleast above what I need.

Could anyone advise on how TDEE works and generally how many extra calories I'd need for roughly 1 hour of barbell exercises?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>
