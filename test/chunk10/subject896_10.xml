	<TEXT> Of course he is. He's a sociopath. Sociopaths love winning. It's their main concern in life, even when there is no them vs whatever, they will make one up so they can defeat the 'other side'. The election was basically a giant competition in which the entire country watched. It was his biggest audience ever and he won the game. That's all he was concerned about. He never once thought ahead about what it would mean to actually be president. He just can't stop living in the 'glory days' of the time he publicly won the game. It feeds his sociopathic needs. Being president does not. 

The man is not mentally stable enough for this job.  </TEXT>

This is my DVD remote and it's poorly designed, obviously. The unlabeled button has no affect on the DVD player that I have discovered. Perhaps when I press it, I am causing good or bad in the world. YOU DECIDE.

	<TEXT> I quite like this. More age appropriate per the books and I really like the sadness in her face. I also dig the hybrid of her dress from the show with the classic violet eyes from the books. At least... I think they're violet. Viewing mobile, so I could be wrong. I fucking love when artists give Dany her purple eyes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meh, not a big fan of this. I mean, the artist clearly knows what they are doing artistically, but I would have preferred Dany to be younger, more girl-like, less sexualized, without the creepy grin. Closer to the book is always my preference though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a child, I grew up in Korvosa and my faith resided in Abadar- a lawful god of earth . My mother is the elven World Champion of Tower and Ruk sensation Maria Kournikova. My human father was renowned poet and masterwork musician LL Ice Cube. Gold and fame were as common to them as a bowl of brown is to peasants. 


While my father, LL, had an illustrious career before I was born, his success had dwindled by the time I was a young child. I can remember how desperate he was to regain the glory and fame hed once had. Obsessed with regaining his mad street-cred, he dove deeper into a gambling and drug addiction which lead our family into a massive debt. Mother did everything she could to help and even though I was young, I knew that our fortune was gone and he was ruining us. 


It was at the age of 10 that my life was turned upside down. As I now know, I was sold to Gaedren Lamm by none other than my own father, LL. His debts had gone too deep and he was so desperate for money that he had turned to a known killer and sociopath, Gaedren Lamm. LL brought me deep into the citys slums and sold me like cattle to the most wretched man known to Korvosa, all to save his own skin! I remember things going awry during the hand-off and before I knew it Gaedren had slain my father in front of my eyes. Perhaps it was guilt or regret for what he was doing, or perhaps Lamm had short changed him, which wouldnt be surprising. Either way, my father started to fight Lamm and his men to free me, but it was too late. It was done. I watched him slowly fade from the world as the pool of his blood grew larger and larger beneath my feet. 


I have never known such betrayal in all of my life and Lamm loved to remind me of it as he laughed maniacally at my pain, the sadistic bastard. He often told me that LL had confessed that he was not my real father which was probably a lie. As I grew older, I came to realize that this may, perhaps, be true...


After Lamm had taken me, he worked me to the bones forced me to sleep next to half starved lions that hed bought to either sell to a circus or be slaughtered for meat. There was no telling what that man had planned for those lions or for me. He was always threatening to feed me to them should I ever choose to foolishly disobey him. Year after year, the lions and I grew to become companions and caretakers of one another. I would sneak fresh meat in to feed them and they would sleep next to me to keep me warm during the harsh winters. As a Druid, I learned how to communicate with them and eventually hold dominion over a couple of the young males. 


One day, fearing for my life, I decided to escape with two of the adolescent male lions: The Ghost and The Darkness. Gaedren Lamm caught us mid escape and in a rash move, set fire to The Ghosts glorious golden mane causing panic to us all. As The Ghost growled and roared in pain, I ran back to him to put out the fire as The Darkness lunged at Lamms throat. As he pounced with all the ferocity he could manage, Lamm tragically shot him in the heart. He was dead before he even hit the ground. It was this selfless sacrifice of a wild and broken beast that granted me my freedom. A part of me died that day along with The Darkness. Seeing just how dangerous Lamm could be, The Ghost and I pressed on and managed to escape with our lives. I tended to The Ghosts wounds as we fled the city into a nearby forest. I vowed that day that I would have my revenge on Gaedren Lamm. For The Darkness. For The Ghost. For my own barbaric imprisonment. 


We did the best we could to survive on our own deep in the woods. We spent years thriving in the forest where we practiced hunting and Drudeism. The Ghosts glorious mane never grew back- a permanent scar and reminder of what we both lost that day. It was as if Lamm had stolen The Ghosts power when he torched his golden mane. He was depressed and his heart was broken. I pledged to help my friend regain his confidence and grow back into the fierce lion he had once been. Once we regained our strength and practiced our combat training in the woods, we decided it was time to return to Korvosa. For The Darkness. For revenge. And also to design a fabulous golden wig for my faithful feline companion at the Korvosan Institute of Lion Prosthetics and Technology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very cool. Considering he was never even born, you don't see much fanart of Rhaego. Heavy Dothraki look, but if he and Drogo had survived, then it would stand to reason that he'd have been raised in the horde, rather than Westeros. Thanks for sharing! </TEXT>
