	<TEXT> If your 5x5 suat is still at 105lbs, don't switch up your program. Don't even worry about it. You just gotta stay consistent. Squatting this weight after a year of training is really, really bad progress to be honest. You have to follow the training program week after week, don't skip any workouts. Also, take a look at your sleep and nutrition. If you are sleeping 5 hours/night, you shouldn't expect good results but even then 105 lbs is really weak. Maybe it's also that you don't push yourself enough.

Regarding your last question, it depends. If you really have a strength imbalance you've gotta fix that by doing unilateral work, yes. But it is likely more of a form issue. I had the same problem and focusing on proper technique really helped.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No you are not overtraining, 12 sets would normally be considered a lot but your are counting the warmup sets too. As the others said get on a proper program, not having a plan is one of the worst things you can do if you want actual results, and don't try to design a program yourself. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Training style: only lifting explosively, never grinding a rep </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello there, I had a question on my mind regarding training styles. A lot of times I tend to grind reps, doing hard sets close to failure. Now I know this might be good for hypertrophy, but what about only lifting explosively, terminating the set once speed slows down and never going to failure? This has the advantage that you can perform more quality sets. You could for example do 10 sets of 3 reps with your 6-8 rep max. Is this better if you are training for strength? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A really good tip for the deadlift is to 'push the floor away'. Pretend as if you are doing a leg press. This really helped me to make the movement more explosive and getting power from the hams and glutes instead of just the lower and upper back. Also, when you are near lockout really squeeze your glutes instead of just leaning back. Lastly it looks like your back is not neutral so work on that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Work on bracing. Squeeze your abs and glutes hard before the lift and take a big breath before you descent, breathing out when you finished the rep or when you are past the sticking point (valsava maneuver). And depth could be a little better as u/Wildesy said. Work on increasing ankle dorsiflexion mobility and push your knees a little more over your foot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are not squatting deep enough. Work on squat mobility.
Also, it looks like your lower back is rounded in the lower portion of the squat which is dangerous. Brace your core and glutes hard and use the valsava manouvre.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really. Doing a full-body routine with supersets and around 1 minute between exercises should already get you sweating, but you can add a metabolic 'finisher' after each workout. This is what I do myself. It only has to be around 5 minutes, max 10. For example what I would do:

3 rounds of 20 Kettlebell swings followed by 10 clapping pushups. Rest as little as possible.

	<TEXT> Most t-nation articles are bs and TC luoma is full of shit. There are some really good authors at t-nation though, like Max Shank, Dan John and Charles Staley. But even good guys like Tony Gentilcore seem to be forced to write 'add this exercise to your workouts and you will get jacked instantly' articles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Go back to school. Also as far as I know 12+ reps in a set isn't all that useful if your main goal is strength and size (except maybe for isolations).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you do them like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbTWvtJDQjU) you can definitely build muscle as you can constantly progressive overload. I started doing these instead of the bench press and it really made a huge difference in terms chest activation and it also seems to be a lot gentler on the shoulders.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are eating way too much protein. 300 grams is insane, especially when bulking. Eating more protein will not give you better gains, only smart and hard training will. And I am not OP, but he mentioned in the comments that he had already been training for some years, so yeah he already had some decent muscle mass which is also apparent from the pictures.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I remember I could actually do 40 pushups, going all the way down. That was because I actually trained them quite a lot. The chin ups were very questionable as I did not train those. I can't remember exactly but the rom was certainly very limited.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't see it as negative at all, but I can imagine why they might downvote you because it might discourage anorexic people that are trying to gain weight. If it was for the people with the eating disorders themselves, they wouldn't let themselves get fat, no way. It's the way eating disorders are treated. You are not allowed to engage in any physical activity and you have to gain at least 0.5  kg per week. And if you start as a skeleton with no muscle mass at all, of course that will cause you to gain quite a bit of fat. The other option would be  to gain weight very slowly and do some resistance training, but that means staying underweight for several months while possibly feeding the disorder.  </TEXT>
