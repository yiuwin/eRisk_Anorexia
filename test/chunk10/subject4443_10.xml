	<TEXT> Trump had a meeting with the Russian ambassador and Foreign Secretary, the day after he fired FBI Director Comey. 

He fired Comey for investigating his Campaigns ties with Russia.  

Trump then went on to bar any western /American media outlet from covering the Russia meeting, which BTW happened at the White House. While the Russian media were the only one allowed to cover it and take photos of it. ( So no one aside from the Russians were given access to a meeting with the American President, in the Oval Office of the White House) . 

Trump revealed vital classified intelligence info about ISIS, given by an European ally, to the Russians while boasting during the meeting. 

While he's legally allowed to declassify things, there's a procedure for it. And hardly anyone would expect a President, of all people, to give sensitive info to an adversary. Which would be Traitorous. Especially, under the circumstances under which it has taken place.

The information he shared could compromise the ally and cause problems for them.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Everyone knows Dave. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-16 05:52:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Dave was bragging to his boss one day, "You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them."

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, "OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?"

"No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it." So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

"Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

"No, no, just name anyone else," Dave says.

"President Obama," his boss quickly retorts.

"Yup," Dave says, "Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington," and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, "Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

"Pope Francis," his boss replies.

"Sure!" says Dave. "I've known the Pope for years." So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, "This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope." He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, "What happened?"

His boss looks up and says, "It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely.  An RX 580 with a FreeSync monitor will be cheaper and cost effective for you overall. And will give you great performance at 1080p.  Which is great.  


A 1070 will let you game at 1440p. And you'll need a GSync monitor to take full advantage of the adaptive sync.  GSync monitors a fairly expensive. Plus. While 1440p and 4k gaming has evolved and become a great experience, it's still a bit on the expensive side. Hence my recommendation.  

Also, there's a thumbrule we follow when recommending graphic cards.  1080p gaming and below, go for AMD.  1440p and above, go for Nvidia.  Those are their sweet spots considering price and performance.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry about that.  What you can do with my build is replace the case and the graphics card with yours. That'll cut down the price drastically. Keeping the rest same will help keep price in check.  

As some mentioned Ryzen processors are a bit more future proof. I've added faster ram since the processors benefit from it.  But Frankly, for a Ryzen build, go for a 2x8gig GSkill FlareX ram modules. They're most compatible. 

Also. Main thing.  Keep an eye on r/buildapcsales. You can probably snag most of your parts there for cheap when there are deals for them.  

Yep. That case is amazing.  Really wanted to cut back on it. But the tempered glass and RGB fans in the front make the build look amazing.

For 1080p 60fps you could also get a RX 580 8 GB and further save some cash.  </TEXT>

On the other hand you can probably ask a friend who has a 6th gen processor to lend his and update it on your own.  

Make sure to replace your thermal paste each time you remove the cooler from the CPU. If this is the first time you are booting the system and that's the error you're getting, then it's most probably the processor mobo compatibility issue.  </TEXT>

Because of the funding cuts, the NHS is severely understaffed and facing a shit ton of problems daily. The main reason why no one there gets around to upgrading or even updating their systems.  

About GCHQ and NSA. Well there's no way we can defend the shit they're doing or how carelessly they're doing it. </TEXT>

"There ain't no way they can catch a Corvette," he thought to himself and opened her up further. The needle hit 90, 100, 130 and finally 150 with the light still behind him. "What the hell am I doing?" he thought and pulled over.

The cop came up to him, took his license without a word and examined it and the car. "I've had a tough shift and this is my last pull over. I don't feel like more paperwork so if you can give me an excuse for your driving that I haven't heard before you can go!"

"Last week my wife ran off with a cop," the man said, "and I was afraid you were trying to give her back!"

"Off you go," said the officer.

	<TEXT> For starters. Do you live near a microcenter?  You can get your processor and motherboard at rock bottom prices there. Plus their proc+. Mobo combo further knocks $30. 

Second. Keep an eye out on r/buildapcsales. It's a great sub for deals. Online and offline. 

About your system. 

Good system overall. But. 
Go for a slightly faster ram(as per your budget) . Ryzen processors benefit from a faster ram. Also you did right by choosing 2 smaller sized ones than one bigger sized. That way you can dual channel them. 

About the graphics card. Good choice. But I've read that people are scoring the refresh 580 for less than the 480 at places. Do check that out. 

You can also save money on Windows. Microsoft lets you use Windows 10 for free. The only catch is that there's a watermark on the bottom right corner. If that's no biggie, then go for it. 

About building the PC. I'd say building it on your own well be a lot more cooler. Also it'll show how much you've invested in them, other than just the money. Plus it'll save you some $$$ on labor. You can learn how to do it by watching YouTube videos. Plus we're here for you if anything comes up.  


About theming. You can probably use RGB or single color led ram(this might be expensive) . Also, led strips inside the case can add to the color scheme(this will be cheaper) . 

Overall great build.  Cheers for your generosity and love, mate.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The son turned from the window to his mother and asked, "If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?"

The mother said, "Well, maybe that's something you could ask the stewardess."

So the boy asked the stewardess, "If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?"

The stewardess responded, "Did your mother tell you to ask me?"

The boy admitted that this was the case. "Well, then, tell your mother that there are no baby planes because Southwest always pulls out on time. You can ask your mother to explain it to you."

One day they found an injured dog. They took it home and nursed it back to health. They hid the dog and never told their mother afraid she would kick the dog out. In fact they never told anyone.

 To keep from arousing any suspicions they named the dog "This" so the name could be used in conversation. One day This ran away. They never saw This again. No one else knew about This. No one even knew a dog named This existed. Only Ninety's kids will remember This. </TEXT>
