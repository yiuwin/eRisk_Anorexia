	<TEXT> Hi all, I've recently started to watch Anime and im in search for some hardcore Science Fiction... 

I've watched Akira which blew my mind. 

I then went onto Ghost in the Shell.. Which i found amazing. 

Im now watching Cowbow Beebop and it's pretty great too. 

What else would you recommend for me, something similar to Ghost in the shell, Akira, cowboy Beebop... ?

Thanks all.

	<TEXT> So i play pro clubs with some great team mates, I'm the main striker and I do get a few goals here and there... But generally my play isn't great. Whenever an opponent is within a meter of me, I'm losing ong the damn ball. I watch my teammates perform mazy runs through defenses or, watch them take the ball to the corner flag, only to turn with ease and go around two players. They make itblook so simple...
Now if I try anything they do... Dispossessed. 
Can anyone give me some pointers or tips on how to improve? My striker is ranked 88.  </TEXT>
