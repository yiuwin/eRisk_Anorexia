That's been the idea put out there for a while, to have his daughter go looking for him. I'd be totally down for that, definitely.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair enough.  There are levels to it, though, you know? Where you get something that's pretty cult, but people talk about it frequently enough.  This show doesn't seem to have had that staying power.  I could be way off base, though.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> After this year's upfronts I have one question: Is there even a DISCUSSION about bringing back Quantum Leap? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-18 21:23:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Roseanne, Will and Grace, Twin Peaks, Gilmore Girls, Fuller House, Girl Meets World, etc., etc., etc.  Of all of the shows that are coming back or have come back as continuations, why *not* Quantum Leap? This is just a rant, basically, but seriously are there any viable rumors at all that this might be happening?  In my life I've been burned by failed film scripts too many times to get my hopes up, but part of me still believes.  

There's no reason not to do it, in my mind, Sci-Fi and time travel are still obviously popular, the demand is there, I'd think, but maybe that's where I'm over-valuing the show.  In my mind it's one of the biggest cult classics ever, but in a quick poll around work, it seems like most people here never watched it.  

If they did it, would you rather it be a continuation with Bakula, or a new character that eventually runs into him, as I've seen other people suggest could be a decent plot? With Twin Peaks coming back, I've become more convinced that with enough love and support from original cast/crew, this is something that could and should happen, but I wouldn't want it without Bakula.  Maybe a spin-off could be fun, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMO, they expected one or two of about four or five scenarios and saw $$$: 

1) Ronda beats Nunes  Gets a shot at being a 2-division champ

2) Ronda beats Nunes, Holly beats GDR  Ronda gets a shot at being a 2-division champ AND they get that highly sought-after rematch. 

3) Ronda beats Nunes, Holly beats GDR, Ronda beats Holly  Ronda is 2-division champ AND we get to see her fight Cyborg, finally.  

4) Ronda beats Nunes, Holly beats GDR, Holly beats Ronda  Holly Hype Train is back in motion, Holly then either goes back to Bantamweight to try HER luck at 2-division champ status or 

5) Ronda beats Nunes, Holly beats GDR, Holly beats Ronda  Holly Hype Train is back in motion, Holly fights Cyborg.  

All of these are big money scenarios for the UFC and even if the first part doesn't happen and you get no scenarios with Ronda, you STILL get the last scenario, which is Holly v Cyborg...until, of course, everything went to shit and: 

1) Ronda lost
2) Holly lost
3) Cyborg popped 

Literally everything that could've gone wrong DID.  Now, even with Cyborg already pretty much back in you have NO story-lines remaining.  Who cares if Cyborg fights GDR?  Nunes has no interest in going to Featherweight.  It's just not there.

The best thing that could've happened is if NYSAC had overturned Holly's loss, the thing went to a no contest and we pretended it never happened.

	<TEXT> AJ is in my all-time favorites, probably a top 3 favorite fighter of mine, but I wouldn't call him a GOAT. 

He's the P4P top shoulda coulda woulda GOAT though.  If he had been more interested in winning than not getting knocked out, but that never seemed to be his thing. At this point, I think we all know he gives his back up if he's afraid of taking too much damage.  Take away that aspect, and have him not waste half of his career at WW and you're probably talking about the alternate reality where he's the GOAT.  </TEXT>

I do have a short torso, haha. Trying one of the bikes this weekend was amusing to the people helping me because every time we'd get my legs right it would make my arms too short for the bike.  Eventually he told me he'd just adjust the bike manually for me if I bought it, so that the handlebars would fit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not really that you're putting me off of it so much is that it doesn't sound like the bike I want is something that I should get, hence not really wanting the bike, in that case. 

I will be riding it on trails.  I will be riding it at a local park with gravel bike paths.  I *might* be riding it to work.  I don't know about the last part.  I was not under the impression that two of the bikes I were looking at were mountain bikes, I was told they were hybrids.  It's possible I misunderstood

If I didn't get the brakes and went with this bike instead, what about it would not be suiting what I've described?

	<TEXT> Ah that's disappointing to hear. The three bikes were selected by three different reps at three different bike shops, so I was hoping one of them would do the trick for what I was looking for. 

I'll be honest, having time to think it over, I'm getting cold feet on the whole purchase anyways. Part of the reason I was so focused on disc breaks is that I'm VERY frightened of riding it on the streets. Not sure I'll end up really doing much of anything with it once my foot heels, as a result. 

Thanks for your help!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looking at getting my first bike.  I've posted over at r/whichbike, but if anyone has advice as well, I'd really appreciate the help.  C/P of my post there: 

  Hi everyone,

 I'm looking to get a bike to keep myself active while recovering from tendinitis after a long race. I figured, though, since I recently started a job closer to home, maybe I could also start commuting to work. Fitness is first and foremost on my priorities list, and after some shopping around today I came down to three options and I'd appreciate some advice:

 1) Haro Flightline Two (2014) -$480 This is the bike I want most, and a strong part of that is I like the paint job on it, so I'm trying to ignore that aspect. This option also has financing available, so I'm freed up to spend more money on things I need right away (lights, lock, pump, etc.) and could maybe get the revolights, which would make me feel a lot safer commuting.

 2) Cannondale Quick 5 with disk brakes - $600+ (can't remember exactly.) This is the most expensive option, but the store I found it at offers lifetime free tuneups. The one thing I'm concerned about is reviews saying it's not great offroad.

 3) Liv Bliss 2 - $380 And finally, I found this bike, which is the cheapest option, seems like a good value, and would allow me to buy the bike outright, and any other accessories I might need, but is the bike I'm least passionate about.

 Your level of experience with cycling - Road bikes a lot as a kid, and commuted during college, but that was only about 1 mile each way on sidewalks.

 What's your price range, and have you considered second hand? - $300-$700 (but I don't WANT to spend $700 because of tax, that's like the actually upper limit all included). I looked around second hand a bit, but I am fairly short and finding a bike that I want in my size has proved difficult.

 What's your intention with the bike - commuting, fitness, touring, sport, etc? - Fitness first and foremost, then potentially commuting. I have very little interest in touring right now (but maybe sometime down the road I'll add it to the group of activities I like to do. I'm very scared of dying on a bike, so it's unlikely I'll tempt fate to that degree).

 How far will you be riding, and how often? - For now, I'd like to ride for about an hour four days out of the week. I'd like that to be about 12 miles, but we'll see about that/where I can find to ride it)

 Riding conditions: roads, pavement, trails, single-track, off-road? Flat or hilly? Traffic and weather. - Pavement most of the time and road. I'm going to take it on trails eventually, though. I live in SOCal, so trails are hilly as are the streets.

	<TEXT> Hey, I appreciate that :).  For someone who's only been watching a year and a half, I've certainly come a long way, and I do really try to do my research on cards to see how the MMA Math works out. 

I don't mind losing the money so much, I just laughed pretty hard because I'd been talking a lot about the card and SEVERAL people texted me afterwards giving me a lot of (deserved) crap.  

I'm sure I'll buy a PPV again, I just have a really good time going out, so if I can do that, I'd rather. 

I'm SO bummed about this weekend, but I actually booked a trip to see some high school friends, and I don't think they'll want to watch the card :(  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I disagree.  If I'd known Glover's arm was hurt, that've been a different story, but I expected Miller/Poirier to be fight of the night (and I was right about that at least), Glover to finish by major knockout, Souza to win by a slick sub (right there again as well), and then I'm not about to miss Silva, though I expected more out of that fight.  As for the main event, while I think a Women's Featherweight division is stupid as hell, I very much expected that fight to be a killer.  Didn't expect Holly to fight so defensively.  

So in my mind you were looking at: 
Fight of the Night

Knockout

Sub

Knockout/Sub  I actually specifically called a triangle and got really excited when Anderson started going for one at the end, but it didn't happen

Two-way beat down

Almost none of that came to fruition, of course.  Ahhh well. </TEXT>

I had it in my head that the way the matchups were shaping up, the main card would be all badass finishes. I was really, REALLY convinced it was going to be fantastic.  My husband wasn't feeling well and didn't want to go out, but we both wanted to see if I was right, so he was like, 'ah fuck it, let's just buy it.' So we did and...well...I'm sorry to you all for making UFC 208 so boring, haha.  </TEXT>

I mean, the guy's name is literally what Japanese speakers use to say they're feeling well/in good spirits, so it's nice to see someone living their namesake so thoroughly. 

(By the way, what an odd intro he has to his Wikipedia article: 

Genki Sudo is a Japanese singer, composer,[2] choreographer, actor, professional calligrapher and author. He is the producer, director, and former lead vocalist of the music group World Order,[3] which is known for their techno music style and highly synchronised robotic choreography. Sudo is a retired mixed martial artist and a kickboxer who, until December 31, 2006 competed in the Japanese fighting organization HERO'S and before that, the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Pancrase.

I thought I was on the wrong wiki page at first because it took three sentences to get to him being an MMA fighter, haha. )  </TEXT>

To write a book around lost photos is brilliant.  I wish I had known that was how it had come to be going in, because for the most part, I found the book kinda tedious and meandering.  It's clearly the opening to a series, which I was hoping it wouldn't be.  One thing I don't like about this book club is the tendency to nominate books that are part of a series, because now I need to read the rest of the series!!! _  (mostly kidding) </TEXT>
