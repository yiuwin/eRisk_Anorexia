There is a list of ingredients on the side of the package, too. It is pretty obvious if something is pure juice as its only ingredient will be juice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are pretty specific product labeling laws. Such labels adhere to them. "Made with real fruit juice" means exactly that - that the product contains real fruit juice. If it didn't, it'd be false advertising. But simply saying something was made with real fruit juice, when it actually is, even if real fruit juice is only a small part of the product, is not misleading.

They could not label it with "100% fruit juice!" unless it was (very nearly) 100% fruit juice. This is why Taco Bell's meat filling is called that instead of "100% beef" - it is 88% beef, with the other [12%](http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/535e7e86ecad04e0161f7334-659-164/screen%20shot%202014-04-28%20at%2012.13.14%20pm.png) being too great in quantity to be considered 100% beef.

If you're interested, the regulations for food labeling are extremely long and pretty specific in a lot of cases.

I've read some of them; they're kind of interesting in the sense of "God, mayonnaise has a remarkably specific definition" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I'm just really sensitive to, you know, *scientific fraud* in pursuit of a desired conclusion. I can't imagine why that would be a sore spot for me.

I get very annoyed when people with an agenda create shitty studies to try and push it. It doesn't matter if you're trying to sell books (the power pose people), have some sort of ideological agenda (half of sociology at this point, it seems at times), or just trying to publish a bunch of crap so you seem important (too many people to count).

I feel like, when a Google search or a call to an insurance company would ruin the entire premise of a study, and you have multiple people's names on a study, "We didn't think of checking" no longer cuts it, and "we deliberately didn't check" (or "We checked and then pretended like this was a good idea anyway") are the default.

The way I see it, when you submit a paper to be published, you're staking your credibility on it. If you fail to do even basic research, that suggests to me that you really don't have any. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If luxury drivers as a group are more likely to drive in an aggressive way, it still shows that a certain group of affluent people are affected in some negative way by their wealth.

Nope! What it shows is that reckless drivers are more likely to purchase luxury cars - which isn't surprising if you spend any time at all thinking about it. What kind of person buys a Ferrari 458 Spider (the most crash-prone vehicle)? Do you think that kind of person is more likely to have automobile accidents?

You are making the mistake of reversing cause and effect. You believe (because you *desperately* want it to be true) that wealth has a negative effect on people. But in actuality, if you spend any time at all thinking about it, the kind of person who lusts after a car like that is already likely to be a dangerous, speed-obsessed driver.

The car doesn't make the man.

Now, let's consider the much more obvious: what is unethical behavior?

Now, you can measure proxies for this. But only a very dishonest person would do so when you can just skip to actual data. In fact, it is one of the classic forms of misdirection.

None of the other studies actually measure unethical behavior at all; they're just attempts at using proxies, which have never been demonstrated to be linked to actual unethical behavior (and indeed, if you look at the sampling methodology, it likely isn't very good to begin with).

But we *can* measure unethical behavior directly.

Let's look at crime rates. What percentage of criminals are poor?

[Incarcerated persons had a median average income prior to their incarceration of $19k in 2014.](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/income.html) This would put them down in the range of poverty. Indeed, it is strongly predictive of it; previous median income for incarcerated blacks was $17k and incarcerated whites was $21k, despite the fact that non-incarcerated blacks pull in about $30k/year and non-incarcerated whites about $47k/year. This suggests that not only are criminals poor, but they are all about the same in terms of economic level - the difference between black and white criminals is much smaller than the difference between blacks and whites in general society.

We know that about [80% of felony criminal defendants use public defenders](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/dccc.pdf).

Given that poor people make up only 15% or so of society, this suggests that felons are *overwhelmingly* poor - people who can actually afford their own lawyers are committing only about 20% of the felonies.

Oops.

Well, I guess that settles it, then, doesn't it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Camping should be highly situational - something which is a good idea to do on occasion, but only for brief periods of time. If campers have too much of an advantage, the optimal strategy is to camp yourself, and if everyone is camping, then no one is interacting.

You want to create dynamic situations.

Camping is a game design issue, not a player issue, though - games should discourage camping via their mechanics. Complaining at players for camping in games where camping is optimal is futile. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  While I agree income brackets are more meaningful (in general), they are not a measure; a measure must be just a number (preferably a positive one), but income brackets are vectors.

Vectors are measured all the time.

 The Gini coefficient is a compression of the information carried by income brackets, and it is a very robust measure for that function.

Actually, it isn't. At all. Which is my entire point. If it was robust it wouldn't have such bad outliers.

The outliers all correspond with the flaws in the metric. Gini tells you nothing in and of itself.

You're saying that Barack Obama is more likely to commit crimes because he's black. That's the exact mistake you're making here.

 Also the two examples you give buck trends for a wide variety of reasons.

It isn't a "wide variety of reasons". Both countries are affluent, stable, and well-educated. The US much more strongly resembles the Nordic states than Peru or Haiti. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm afraid you're being deceived by horrible people. If you actually look at the study, you can see that they deliberately manipulated the studies in ways which show either utter incompetence or deliberate attempts at manipulating the results.

The study on pedestrians, for instance, was utter garbage. They used luxury vehicle drivers as a proxy for rich people. The problem is that most rich people don't drive luxury vehicles, and luxury vehicle drivers are statistically much worse drivers than other affluent drivers (they're more likely to get in accidents) - which is one of the reasons why luxury car drivers pay higher insurance rates.

Simply asking an insurance company or even Googling it would have found this out. The fact that they either didn't do this, or did do so and then pretended like it was a good proxy, indicates deliberate scientific fraud, as that is basic background research. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of it has more to do with the level of abstraction. In a game like rocket league, there's a 1:1 correspondance between your inputs and what the car does. In a FIFA game, the correspondance isn't so tight - the player is dribbling naturally, you don't have to "hit the brakes" to turn direction rapidly, ect. When you shoot, you aren't doing the rocket league thing of "how fast is the car going relative to the ball? What is the physics?" the player that the player is controlling winds up and takes a kick.

	<TEXT> Thoroughbreds have a death rate of about 1 per 500 starts due to injuries, and about 85% of those are from broken legs. This varies somewhat from country to country; in Japan it is over 3 per 100 starts, while in Hong Kong it is only 0.7 per 1000 starts.

The underlying cause of this is generally repetitive stress fractures which eventually result in the bone shattering when placed under greater stress, such as when going around a corner during a race. This is why repeatedly racing a horse during a small period of time increases the chance of injury, and also why a lot of successful racehorses are retired so early; the sooner they're retired, the less chance there is for cumulative stress to result in a broken leg. Other factors likely play a role in this as well. But the cause isn't that these horses are randomly breaking their legs for absolutely no reason at all; it is a repetitive stress injury which results in breakage when put under a lot of stress, such as when running full-out in a race.

While this rate may seem high, it is hardly unique to thoroughbreds. Leg fractures are the most common kind of broken bone in humans, and in the US, about half a million people break their leg each year. That's a rate of about 1 in 600 per year. In terms of lifetime risk, humans break their legs more often than thoroughbred horses do.

It should also be noted that high injury rates for athletes aren't actually that unusual. 4 in 5 human runners suffer from some sort of injury *per year*. About 10% of all injuries suffered by high school athletes are fractures. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More wealth = happier people, so it makes sense that a society where most people are poor is going to be less happy than a society where few people are poor. So really, it is just repeating the same obvious fact. It isn't that inequality makes people unhappy, it is that being poor makes people unhappy.

The gini coefficient is a poor measure of such; there are better measures, such as looking at income brackets, which are more predictive than gini is. Having a high gini doesn't really tell you much about the distribution of wealth in the society; looking at brackets is much more informative and helpful. The correlation between gini and happiness is because gini is a proxy for poverty rates, but there are better measures of poverty than gini which give you better data.

This is why the US and Israel have high Ginis but are very happy; our poor people are well above average by global standards, while most of our society is very well off indeed.

This is why Gini is pretty much worthless; it tells you nothing of value about a society. It is a flawed metric which shouldn't be used. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Horses with other broken bones (like broken ribs) generally recover. It it is broken legs that generally end them, because horses' body plans are not good for recovering from them. In the wild, horses with broken legs almost invariably die (get eaten by predators like wolves or lions or whatever), so there wasn't much evolutionary pressure for them to evolve to be able to recover from them.

We can fix their legs, and have successfully done so at times, but most of the time, the animal won't survive. A horse ends up putting too much weight on its other three legs, which results in laminitis, which is a condition in which the cannon bone (the bottom bone in the leg) will eventually press down through the bottom of the hoof. It can also cause deformation in the other limbs.

Horses can't lie down for long periods of time; even humans can only lie down for so long before developing bed sores, but if horses spend all day lying around, it causes problems much more quickly, including internal ones. They develop abcesses and other big problems.

The main way to get a horse to recover under these circumstances is to suspend them via a sling, to try and prevent some of the aforementioned issues. Still, it often doesn't work; Barbaro, who was a horse who was worth an enormous amount of money, had high-quality medical treatment about a decade ago and still had to be put down after about eight months of medical intervention because the problems just kept coming.

If horses were intelligent, we could probably fix them. But they're not; they're animals.

Some horses will recover from broken legs, but most won't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It isn't really that hard to predict. If an animal is heavily dependent on rapid locomotion for survival - either to chase down prey or to escape predators - it is very unlikely to survive having a badly damaged or amputated ambulatory limb.

Animals which aren't very fast to begin with probably aren't heavily dependent on rapid locomotion for survival. Chimps aren't super slow or anything, but their lifestyle isn't hugely dependent on being able to dash around rapidly, and they can move around on three legs. It is somewhat more vulnerable to predation, but chimps are big, dangerous animals already, and don't have a huge number of predators as adults.

If a zebra breaks its leg, it is going to get eaten by a lion. If a cheetah breaks its leg, it is going to starve to death because it can't catch anything and other scavengers will likely drive it off of carcasses. If an anteater breaks its leg, it isn't like the ants are going to get away, and it isn't like it wasn't already a fairly slow animal, so it is probably much less likely to die. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is true of almost all wild animals. Animals can survive things like broken ribs, but broken ambulatory limbs almost always result in death in the wild.

If you think about it, that makes sense; what happens to a creature with a broken leg? It is going to get eaten by a lion or a wolf. A predatory animal will likely starve because it cannot hunt down prey and is itself much more vulnerable to predators. Any animal heavily dependent on rapid locomotion for survival - be it to find food or to escape predators - is very likely to die. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't true. Cavalry horses were about the same size as modern riding horses, 14-16 hands at the shoulder, based on the size of barding (horse armor), as well as other historical evidence. Lots of old drawings weren't particularly true to life; other images from the same period showed people whose legs didn't reach below the barrel of the horse.

Armor isn't actually all that heavy, so they wouldn't really need gigantic horses.

Incidentally, one other reason for them being 14-16 hands is that if you were unhorsed during battle, it was easier to get back on their back if they weren't gigantic.

Draft horses at the time were smaller than modern draft horses, though; they were 13-14 hands (modern ones are 16-19 hands) and were quite stout. They likely got larger over time because people started replacing oxen with draft horses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wild horses who break their legs pretty much invariably die. A lot of the problems are simply a factor of being a large animal which didn't evolve to lie down for long periods of time.

While selective breeding has made the problem somewhat worse because domesticated horses are larger than their wild counterparts were, which increases the odds of shatter-type fractures and some other issues, the reality is that horse-like animals with broken legs are extremely vulnerable to predators and have little to no chance of healing.

I mean, what is going to happen if a zebra breaks its leg?

Realistically speaking, it is probably going to get eaten by a lion.

This is probably why there are so many secondary problems when horses break legs - given that horses which break legs almost never reproduce in the wild, there's next to no selective pressure against the other emergent issues (sores, laminitis, messing up the other legs due to the extra weight, ect.).

Horses are quite capable of healing other bone fractures, which is why their legs can in principle heal - broken ribs or whatever are very recoverable. But broken legs are probably almost invariably fatal in the wild.

Indeed, evidence suggests that long-bone fractures in wild animals in general tend to be highly fatal. This isn't very surprising if you think about it; moving around is very important to basically every animal, so unless the animal has some other way to evade predators, get food, ect. (or HAS no predators to begin with) it is probably bad news. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  One big problem is that level progression straight up doesn't work in MMOs. It all becomes about max level which is "endgame" since all the population is there. You can't have any group content if you have no people to group.

To be fair, you can eliminate levels entirely, or do other things with them.

You can make levels do things other than make you linearly more powerful, like unlock more customization options - in The Secret World, for instance, after a certain point, levels no longer gave you any sort of static bonus, but would unlock new abilities that you could swap in and out. They weren't any better than existing abilities, but they let you play using a different playstyle with the same character.

You can do things like, say, setting the whole group to a fixed level for a dungeon/area/whatever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  MMORPGs typically suffer from quite a few issues both in gameplay and in story. To start, the gameplay is extremely repetitive- most games have a 'rotation', where the player has a number of skills which they use in a specific order in most fights, with variations when one of their situational skills is needed. However, most of these skills are completely superfluous. Instead of giving us a small number of abilities that give us an edge in combat but aren't entirely necessary, which is often the norm in single-player games, MMORPGs make your standard attack almost useless. And to make it worse, instead of giving you a small number of useful skills for various situations, they instead give you forty skills that rely on cooldowns to remain useful, half of which are completely situational and will almost never be used outside of high-end content that many users choose not to enter due to the sheer stress and chaos required to get that many people into a group. Compare this to Overwatch, which gives your character a small number of skills that are all constantly used, including more situational ones like Torbjorn's turret.

There are MMORPGs which don't have this problem. Games with much smaller numbers of powers - like Guild Wars 2 - exist, and The Secret World gave heroes only eight powers at a time. The Secret World actually didn't give you a "basic attack" at all - EVERYTHING you did was a power, with some having basically no cooldown. You "cycled" your powers by building up points by using attacks which built up points, and then spent said points on various other powers. You set which powers you were using at any given time, and could use powers from up to two different weapons; depending on which weapons you were mixing, you could get different varieties of tank, healing, and DPS.

TSW wasn't a perfect system, but it kept things pretty simple in terms of powers used at any given time, and you didn't have a bunch of useless powers equipped - you'd only equip powers you actually had some use for.

 Third, the story doesn't actually matter. Your character is only recognized for your feats in related quest chains, and even that is erased over time. The best example of this is World of Warcraft, which often has your character be the chosen one alongside the other million characters. You beat Deadmines before Cataclysm came out and killed Van Kleefe many times, but instead a group of NPCs created specifically for a cutscene about Van Kleefe's death get credit. And there's also the fact that 99% of the quests are filler. Kill x creatures then report back, grab an item and bring back, be a messenger for people standing two feet apart from each other. In single-player RPGs, the quests matter, and have a noticeable impact on the world, but MMORPGs don't do that, and any sense of uniqueness that your character would have had is erased by the fact that everyone else did it too.

This is a common problem in MMORPGs. Part of this is a writing problem - it is possible to make it seem as if you have beaten dungeons or completed quests before by changing NPC dialogue and even environmental effects which are only visible to you, but this requires a lot of work. You can also do things like, say, hide the stuff off in various remote places, so you won't have to deal with the problem visibly.

It can also be circumvented by changing how NPCs interact with the player. While most MMOs have some form of epic questline, that isn't actually necessary - it would be possible to write a story about someone who isn't the hero of the universe. However, this would take away the power fantasy stuff, and instead put you into a different role (Eve does this, from my recollection). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The disparity in test scores is a result of the various socio-economic statuses, not the cause of it.

Here's an obvious test of this: who does better on the SATs, poor white people, or rich black people?

According to your theory, rich black people should do a lot better than poor white people. After all, it is caused by socioeconomic status!

Actual reality?

FYI, the Atlantic article is garbage, I'm afraid. It is citing the "heritability" of IQ amongst [7 year old children.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/u81/Turkheimer_et_al___2003_.pdf)

Here's the thing - the heritability of IQ goes *up* as children get older. Environmental factors have a larger effect on younger children's IQ than on those of older ones.

If adult IQ was primarily caused by environmental factors, how could this be possible?

The answer is that it is because it isn't. The cause of the differences is that environmental factors can lead to a temporary advantage in children, but by the time they reach adulthood, the advantages pretty much entirely vanish.

This is one of the most basic parts of understanding the [high heritability of IQ.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ)

But you don't understand it, so you can easily be tricked by people like this because you don't understand anything about the science.

Why do you think that the author of that article is lying to you?

Well, the answer is obvious - they're trying to manipulate you into believing something that simply isn't true, but which justifies their beliefs.

Their beliefs are obviously false. If they were true, after all, they wouldn't need to lie. </TEXT>

Insider trading is exclusive to people with enough money to actually trade stocks, and access to insider information. So yeah, that's not really something a lot of poor people engage in. But there aren't many crimes like that, and insider trading doesn't make up a huge percentage of crime in the US.

	<TEXT>  To clarify, IQ tests are not particularly effective when comparing across racial lines because there are confounding variables involved in setting the normalisation.

Black people with an IQ of 85 will do about as well as white people with an IQ of 85 on other measures of intelligence, which suggests it is measuring the same thing and is equally accurate for both groups. It would be very unlikely for literally every test to be biased nearly the same amount in favor of whites.

If you consider the IQ gap to be real, it explains a great deal of the differences between whites and blacks in the US - higher crime is associated with lower IQ, worse academic success and lower income is associated with lower IQ, ect. It has a lot of explanatory power, which makes it more likely to be a real thing.

 To use a nonracial example, if men routinely averaged a higher IQ than women, that could be because IQ tests are biased in favour of questions that men tend to be good at (e.g. spatial reasoning) and not that men are intrinsically more intelligent than women in average. However, if women recognised as smart on other metrics routinely scored higher than women who were recognised as unintelligent on other metrics, it would suggest that the IQ tests are still effective for within-gender comparison.

Sure, but it could *also* be because men are smarter on average. The way you'd check would be to compare women and men with the same measured IQ, and see if they showed the same level of other markers for intelligence.

IRL, there's probably not a male-female IQ gap; if there is, it is quite small. There *is* actually a difference in male-female IQ *distributions*, though; men are more likely to be both geniuses and retarded than women are. This is because women have two X chromosomes, while men only have one. It is the same reason that men are more variable in height than women are, and are more likely to suffer from things like colorblindness - they don't have a backup X chromosome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't disagree that intelligence is heritable, i disagree that there is some sort of difference in the average intelligence different races.

Well, then, you're wrong. There's a big difference between blacks and whites, a smaller difference between blacks and hispanics and between hispanics and whites, and a small difference between whites and East Asians. IIRC the averages are something like 85 for blacks, 89 for hispanics, 100 for whites, and 101 for East Asians.

The racial IQ gap is uncontroversial from a scientific point of view; it very much exists and is very obvious, not only on IQ tests, but also if you look at any sort of g-loaded test like the SATs or various military examinations. Or just look at other aspects, like various measures of creativity, or income, or anything else. IQ correlates with these things equally well across races within the US among people for whom English is their first language.

The difference is real. A math test cannot have "racial bias" (math is math), and yet, we see a clear difference in outcomes.

The *cause* of these gaps are unknown, but that they exist is uncontroversial. Indeed, the general ordering of blacks  hispanics  whites  East Asians can be seen on not only IQ tests, but SAT tests, academic achievement, income, crime rates, and many other metrics (note that East Asians actually make slightly *more* money on average than the average white American, commit fewer crimes, do better on tests, have higher academic achievement, ect.).

Given that these things appear across races and IQ tests make as good of predictions for outcomes for blacks as it does for whites in terms of ability, this would suggest that there is no net bias based on race - if there were, no one would use IQ tests.

 Two twins raised in different houses, one rich with attentive parents and wanting for nothing, and one poor, living in the slums with a single mother who works 2 jobs, are going to test differently when given the same test as the same age in the same circumstances.

The difference is actually much smaller than you'd think; twin studies have show that twins adopted separately have increasingly similar IQs as they get older. </TEXT>

They noted that it works within races as well as between races - a member of a race who does better on an IQ test than another member of that race will also show other markers for higher intelligence as well.

That's a sign that the test really is measuring something meaningful. If IQ tests only correlated with intelligence in whites, it wouldn't be very useful. The fact that they correlate across races indicates that they are in fact measuring something other than some sort of cultural correlate with intelligence in white people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correlation is actually evidence for at least a common cause. There *are* spurious correlations, but more often than not, if you see two things which correlate, there's something controlling it.

For instance, the correlation between nesting storks and babies born out of hospitals is caused because more rural areas have fewer hospitals (thus resulting in more home births due to greater distance to travel) and more storks. Neither causes the other, but both are caused by a common factor (ruralness).

One example which may be relevant here: height correlates positively with IQ (taller people have bigger brains on average, and people with bigger brains are somewhat smarter on average). Height also correlates positively with attractiveness (people tend to find taller people attractive). Thus, because people with bigger brains tend to be taller, and people who are taller tend to be more attractive, that's at least one plausible axis by which attractiveness and IQ might have a common cause - greater height is positively influencing both.

Another thing is that people with larger heads tend to have slightly larger brains, and larger heads relative to body size can also be seen as attractive (it is a sign of youth). Larger heads also obviously correlate with height, but even in people of the same height, someone with a slightly larger head is likely to be slightly more intelligent and slightly more attractive, on average.

It actually makes sense that there is at least a very weak correlation between intelligence and attractiveness when you think about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a few reasons for it.

That smarter people are better at presenting themselves is one definite possibility - charisma is a learned ability, and it makes people more attractive. Actually being more conscious and aware of yourself and others probably helps a lot.

However, there's other (genetic) reasons as well, as we can get these traits even just by looking at people, even without observing behavior.

Both symmetry and height are attractive, and both correlate positively with IQ. The former may indicate a lower mutational load (and less disease), the latter generates a bigger brain due to larger body size (and larger brains correlate with higher IQ, IIRC to something like .4 or .5, which is fairly high).

There's also assortative mating - basically, the most successful people are best at landing the most successful mates, on average. Someone who is well above-average in terms of intelligence can make themselves more attractive via success, thus allowing them better mate selection (i.e. more attractive or intelligent mates). Thus, even if there isn't any direct link directly between them, you might see the traits go together because more attractive people can land smarter mates, and smarter people can land more attractive mates, than might otherwise be expected. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's four main causes - dramatic issues (i.e. you don't want one character who is good at everything, so they create "balanced" characters with various strengths and weaknesses), the nerd stereotype, jealousy, and playing to certain audience types.

People get very upset at the idea of people who are better than they are in basically every way, so will try to claim to themselves that they are better in some way - i.e. that money corrupts (despite rich people having much lower crime rates than poor people), that people who are pretty are stupid/people who are smart are ugly/people who are smart don't have "street smarts", ect. </TEXT>

If that looks likely, it is absolutely critical for the Republicans to impeach Trump/Pence sooner rather than later, because if they wait until 2018, if they lose both, then they lose the presidency as well to the Democrats.

	<TEXT>  So according to you no nation in the world is civilized? The government will never be able to represent all people.

Why not?

Representing all the people is entirely possible. You seem to think that means that every individual person gets their way, which is impossible. That's not what "representing the people" means.

 You think liberating jews from death camps is bad? Because that was extremely criminal and I am unable to see any negative effects of that.

That wasn't murder. That was war.

Look, you seem to be desperately grasping at straws here. I live in the United States. It is a good country, by and large, with good laws, by and large. Is it perfect? No. But, generally speaking, it is quite good.

Respecting the rules of the society you live in is important. There are means within our society to push for laws to be changed which don't involve violence in any way.

Societies without such peaceful means to change laws generally are much less stable precisely because you end up with problems like people attacking people for trying to change the law.

 What? The problem was systematic genocide, ultranationalism, extremeist millitarism and authoritarianism.

Authoritarianism is what allowed the systematic genocide and the extremist militarism to exist in the first place.

 They were barely even more authoritarian than most late feudal societies.

They were a lot more authoritarian and had a lot more power and control than those societies did.

That said, there are certainly some similarities, as there are between all authoritarian societies.

 You don't view the economy as a meaningful difference?

Internally they weren't, but externally, they were both states which spent an enormous amount of their resources on their militaries.

 My ideology has nothing to do with violence. I do think violence may be the best tacitc to achieve my ideology however. 

Except your ideology allows you to think the latter thing. </TEXT>

I feel kind of bad for the people who signed up for the event, but it boggles the mind that anyone loaned these clowns millions of dollars to run this thing when they were pretty clearly incompetent.

	<TEXT> ICE is *Immigration and* **Customs** *Enforcement*.

The National Gangs Unit is part of ICE in part because gangs are often involved in drug and weapons smuggling and human trafficking, which fall under their purview. That's why a lot of the people busted in this (about a third) were illegal immigrants - they were people connected to the Mexican drug cartels.

ICE does things other than enforce immigration law; they're really about border controls in general, which includes not only immigration, but also trade and smuggling.

ICE has also done things like shut down websites which were distributing illegal materials in the US; you will sometimes see an ICE notice on a seized torrent site, for instance.

The idea that this wouldn't be part of their jurisdiction is simply false.

	<TEXT>  I think there is a lot of question about whether any of these things are well validated.

Actually, they're very well-validated.

The heritability of IQ, especially in adulthood, is extremely well-validated and is known to be very high. There are a lot of studies on this; the heritability of IQ in adulthood is about .75 (on a 0 to 1 scale). Well over half of variability in adult IQ is caused by genetics.

The correlation between IQ and income is well-validated. It isn't a 1:1 correlation, but it is a correlation of something around .4, with it being somewhat higher for men and lower for women (likely because a lower fraction of women work than men).

The correlation between IQ and academic success is well-validated -
 in fact, it is actually because of a noticed correlation between people's success in various academic subjects that g-theory was developed; ability in all intellectual tasks correlates with each other, which is due to *g*, the general intelligence factor, which IQ tests measure.

The black-white IQ gap is extremely well-known and well measured, and is why blacks do much worse on every g-loaded test than whites do. The cause of the black-white IQ gap is not known. Some people incorrectly believe that because it is known that within-group variability is dominated by genetics, between-group variability must be as well, but this is not the case - it is possible for genetic variability to dominate within-group variability while environmental factors dominate between-group variability, like growing corn stalks in the shade vs the sun. However, people who claim that the cause is known to be environmental are simply wrong (or worse, lying) - the cause is unknown, and many environmental factors (like lead contamination, disease, and malnutrition) have been ruled out or found to be far too small to be the factor (blacks are slightly more heavily exposed to lead than whites are, for instance, but the difference across the population leads to a difference of 0.04 IQ points - nothing compared to the 15 point gap).

 The methodology of measuring IQ is extremely flawed.

You're wrong. People who make claims like this are like global warming deniers.

IQ tests are extremely well-accepted and validated. Look at things like *Mainstream Science on Intelligence* and *Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns*; the overwhelming scientific consensus is that IQ tests do measure intelligence and are good measures of *g*, the general intelligence factor.

People are not "differently abled"; this is one of those pretty little lies. In reality, some people are much smarter than others. In fact, intelligence not only correlates with basically everything positive from an intellectual/academic standpoint, it correlates with a lot of seemingly unrelated people. Smarter people are not only wealthier on average, they're also taller on average and are actually [*more attractive*](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200903/beautiful-people-are-more-intelligent-i) on average.

Thus, if you're dumb, you're more likely to be poor, short, and ugly on average; if you're smart, you're also more likely to be well-off, tall, and pretty.

In real life, people don't have balanced attributes.

As someone once said of Anderson Cooper:

 What a relief. He might be gorgeous and charming, but at least I can comfort myself in the fact that hes insanely wealthy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IQ is a bell curve (hence the name of the book The Bell Curve); IQ is a relative measure of intelligence compared to the average.

The difference between white and black IQ is a standard deviation; this means that the most common white IQ is 100, while the most common black IQ is 85 (in the US, mind).

When you graph it, it looks like [this.](http://www.humanbiologicaldiversity.com/Photos/Race IQ.jpeg)

This doesn't tell you anything about *individual* people (there are smart black people and dumb white people), but it does tell you about distributions across populations.

The further you go away from the peak average IQ for a group, the fewer people there are. Because blacks have a lower average IQ than whites, about as many black people have an IQ of 115 or higher as whites who have an IQ of 130 or higher. About 16% of whites have an IQ of 85 or below, but 50% of blacks have an IQ of 85 or below. Thus, about 84% of white people are smarter than 50% of black people; conversely, about 16% of black people are smarter than 50% of white people.

Thus, black people are less likely to be above average and more likely to be below average as compared to white people, in aggregate across the population.

This 1 SD gap, then, is actually quite large. And as IQ has an enormous influence on life outcomes, this gap is one of the largest factors in the black-white achievement gap in general in the United States.

 Asians seem quite variable (Indians, Chinese, Japanese, Middle Easterners, etc.)

Indians and Middle Easterners are Indo-Europeans ("White people", though obviously some of them are pretty dark skinned). Japanese and Chinese people are East Asians.

Comparing IQs between developed and developing countries is kind of dicey, though, because while environmental factors have a relatively small influence on variation within developed countries, this may not be true within developing countries. It is the corn stalk problem - if you grow some corn in the sun, and some in the shade, the differences within each field of corn is primarily genetically mediated, but the difference between the fields is primarily environmentally mediated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  but it's worth noting that crime statistics are more closely related to class and socio-economic than direct race stats

This is absolutely false, actually.

[Over 50% of homicides and robberies in the US are committed by blacks.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43)

There are *more* poor white people than poor black people. Remember, while blacks are more *likely* to be poor on a per capita basis (26.4% of blacks are poor, compared to only 10.1% of non-Hispanic whites and 12% of Asians), blacks only make up 12% of the population, while non-Hispanic whites make up 63% of the population. Thus, there are more poor whites than there are poor blacks. Indeed, there are more poor Hispanics than there are poor blacks as well. Overall, blacks make up only about a quarter of poor people in the US (10 million out of about 40 million).

Ergo, it is literally impossible for your statement to be true, at least as regards those crimes, even if literally the *only* people who committed crimes were the poor (which is itself untrue).

Indeed, the claim just doesn't hold up in general. One of the major problems is that criminals tend to be of lower SES because the same things which predispose you to criminality also predispose you to poverty - low intelligence, low empathy, poor impulse control, ect. It isn't that being poor makes you a criminal; it is that the same things which cause criminality also cause poverty.

When the Great Recession hit, crime rates did not go up, which is pretty good evidence that poverty doesn't cause criminality.

While there is a relationship between poverty and crime, it is more complicated than "poverty causes crime"; many poor areas in the US don't have especially high crime rates.

The racial crime gap is so large that poor white people commit serious crimes at a somewhat lower rate than *rich* black people.

This is less surprising than it might seem; we see the same thing with SAT scores, where rich black kids do slightly worse than poor white ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of the data put forward by the book is empirically correct; things like *Mainstream Science on Intelligence* and *Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns* talked about a lot of the *scientific* conclusions (i.e. that there are large IQ differences between population groups, that intelligence is highly heritable, that intelligence correlates with basically every positive outcome in life, ect.) and they are quite well validated.

Ironically, while people got super butthurt over the race and IQ portion of the book, a lot of the book wasn't actually about that; that was just one section of it.

While it is impossible to say that racial differences in IQ are caused by genetics right now, it is impossible to say that they aren't, too. A number of environmental factors have been ruled out, but the genetics of intelligence are not sufficiently well understood to draw the conclusion that it is genetic, and there just aren't many good studies on the subject matter (in part because people don't want to fund them). </TEXT>

This is a common practice, FYI; if you run out of time for content, you can make it into DLC. Because you have to get the full game to its final state (so it can go on disc) well before launch, this gives you a window of opportunity to work on DLC.

If you finish the DLC by launch, because you can just send it out instantly over the Internet instead of sticking it on the disc, you can release it at launch with a smaller lead-up window than is necessary for the main game.

The 9 characters DLC is basically a season pass, pre-buying DLC that is coming out later this year.

If you promise people that characters X, Y, and Z will be in the game, and they aren't in the game at launch, then people will get very upset. If you say that they are in a DLC pack, then if you can't get the DLC pack ready by launch, you didn't break any promises. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think that stopping people advocating for genocide is a good thing.

Not via violence it isn't.

 Now it's the government murdering other people and the people struggling to stop them

And that's a good thing.

The government represents all the people, at least in a civilized nation.

 Could you tell me what is morally wrong with being a criminal? A criminal is someone who defies the laws of the nation they reside in. If all states were always morally correct, then being a criminal would be bad. But states have variyng moral compasses. People who resisted nazi occupation and liberated jews were criminals.

Criminals are evil because they hurt other people outside of acceptable boundaries of harm. They violate the rights of others and they have a disregard for the rules which keep societies functional.

Criminals not only harm their victims, they harm society.

"But what about people rebelling against evil governments?"

Murder is still wrong, even in such societies. If you just start killing people left and right, you're a bad person.

Rebelling against a society comes with severe, weighty consequences and is something which needs to be carefully considered.

Things like murder, rape, theft, ect. are evil actions. They are evil actions because they harm others, because they disrupt society, because they disrespect the rules of society, because they are committed by people who feel that the rules don't apply to them, ect.

 I do think that. Sure, the actions casue equal harm, but the people that do it have different intentions and therefore different moral compasses. I'll just simplify it and explain it like this: Someone who murders 1000 random people is a murderer with little regard for life. Someone who murders 1000 jews is a murder with little regard for life AND a racist. Therefore the latter is more evil.

If anything, I'd argue the reverse. Genocidal actions are generally taken against outgroups in perceived defense of/promotion of an in-group. Someone who commits democide is killing members of their own group, and lacks the same sort of moral core as someone who is committing genocide. The person who kills genocide may at least care about someone; someone who commits democide may well care about no one at all.

The Nazis were horrible people, but they had some bare shreds of human decency.

Someone who just kills indiscriminately is likely to lack even that.

 Morally I don't give a fuck whats legal. Rationally I do ofcourse, since breaking laws will harm me, but morally laws are neither good nor bad.

This is simply incorrect. Laws are usually good in a society like ours, and the existence of laws is good and necessary. They're a basic moral framework for what the bare minimum is expected of us by society.

 I never stated that all authoritarians were evil.

I know you didn't. I did. That's because they are.

Authoritarianism is inherently evil.

 I also am generally against authoitarianism, but that is not the main issue with nazis.

It really is. The main issue with Nazis is that they're authoritarian. There's not much of a meaningful difference between the Nazis and the Soviets, in the end.

 In my view, violence itself is neither good nor bad, it is a means to an end.

Then you're wrong. Violence is always bad. It is sometimes simply the least bad option.

Violence is inherently destructive, which means that it is removing value from the world. Sometimes, however, it is better than the other alternatives.

 What if I believe that violence is more efficient than actually arguing with them?

Then you're a horrible person.

 Most people, especially nazis, are very loyal to what they believe would probably not change their minds even if they are proven wrong on all accounts.

What makes you think you are any better than they are, deep down inside?

 Why, of course, the people dont want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece. Naturally, the common people dont want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship."

 There is one difference, I pointed out. In a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.

 Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

You know who said that?

*Hermann Goering.*

You are no better than they were. You have embraced an extremist ideology which says that it is okay to employ violence against people because you've been told that they are a threat.

 Why do you think I go after the common perception of something? I don't want to take action against fascists because they are percieved as noxious, I want to take action because they actively stand against my goals, which includes ending racism and stopping genocide. I really don't get the point of this argument.

You want to take violent public action against fascists because you percieve their ideology as noxious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Er, that was exactly what I was saying?

There have been games since WoW which have innovated. But WoW was the first "good" (or "good enough") MMO, so it managed to capture a lot of people.

Thus, it was not their innovation, it was it being the first "good" one. You have a lot more choices now, so there's less of a critical mass of players and there is less of a sudden surge of people all being introduced to MMOs. </TEXT>

Then again, Ubisoft games seem to often hit the ground of "mediocre but not amazing". </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The rules are not static. A while ago the rules included that you could own people if they had the wrong skin colour. I think that rule was bad, and I think the current rules are bad.

Well, obviously you do. You think that killing people who don't conform to your political leanings is a good thing. We stop people like you from doing bad stuff.

 You mean the state when you say civilizations?

Yes.

 I disagree with the state monopolizing violence, I think it gives police police power to opress people that are unable to resist.

Government monopolies on violence are necessary to maintain lawful order. Without them, you have people murdering other people and the government struggling to stop them.

It is this government monopoly on violence which keeps you safe.

The police are your friend, not your enemy. Well, unless you're a criminal.

 In your opinion, what is evil about genocide?

Genocide is serial murder. Murder is bad per the "do unto others as you would have others do unto you" rule. As you don't want to be murdered, you cannot murder others; the same rule that protects you protects others.

I don't think that someone who murders 1000 Jews is any better or worse than someone who murders 1000 people at random. Democide is no better than genocide.

 Therefore it doesn't matter if we use violence against fascists before or after they gain power, since they are still exactly as evil, now they just have the power to act on it.

Until you commit to doing something bad, it isn't legal to do something against them, and with good reason. Talk is cheap, action isn't.

If you disagree, recognize that you are morally evil because of your stance on this matter, and therefore, it is okay for people to act against you.

  I do want to take violent action against fascists publically organizing, or that have any chance of harming anyone, but I don't think literally genociding them would help in the long run. If they are just supressed, that should be enough.

Fascists are a type of authoritarian. You are as well. All authoritarians are evil. Thus, we should take public violent action against you, by your own logic.

In my eyes, it is fine for people to demonstrate and try to convince others of their point of view, and that subjecting them to violence is wrong. Indeed, if you must use violence against someone who is merely making political statements, it means that you are wrong, because you have no actual argument against them.

It needs to be possible for people to publicly advocate for their views. In fact, it is most necessary to protect the most noxious of views, because those are the ones which most require protection.

If you disagree, then you must agree that all gays, trans people, black civil rights activists, ect. should have been killed in the past for promoting what were perceived at the time as being noxious views.

	<TEXT> The real problem is I'm aware of the nutty people who make these claims, but the claims are, quite simply, not true.

The reality is that sex = gender. Indeed, they are synonyms. The reason why certain people in sociology tried to separate them out is agenda-driven. It isn't a "spectrum" thing, and indeed, almost everyone identifies as the gender they're born as - biological gender determines psychological gender.

The whole idea of gender fluidity is something without much actual empirical basis.

  i could tell you how black crime doesn't exist in a vacuum and didn't come from nowhere, black communities are kept impoverished so of course there's going to be more crime and problems, just like in a poor white community

This is just a blatant lie, I'm afraid.

First off, poor white communities do exist. In fact, there are more poor white people than there are poor black people in the US. If crime was caused by poverty, then we should expect poor white people to commit more crime than poor black people (as there are more poor white people). Instead, over 50% of homicides and robberies are committed by blacks, despite the fact that blacks constitute only about a third of the nation's poor. Blacks commit crimes at a higher rate than whites do, even after adjusting for SES. This is true of other groups as well - poor Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans also commit crimes at a lower rate than poor blacks on a per-capita basis, and on an absolute basis as well.

It should also be noted that the very poorest places in the US are generally rural areas inhabited by poor rural whites and Native Americans, not poor urban areas. So it isn't just absolute poverty.

Secondly, the idea that "black communities are kept impoverished" is simply not true. It is one of those Big Lies which is primarily spread by (ironically) racists. The reality is that the poverty of black communities is largely self-reinforcing - better-off people leave poor black communities because they aren't desirable places to live or start a business, and if a place ceases to be undesirable to live in, it will attract more people and cease to be a poor black community. There are many black communities which aren't poor - most black people aren't poor, in fact.

But the places which are poor and overwhelmingly black aren't places that most people want to live due to the high crime rates. People talk about white flight, but it is really everyone flight - better off black people don't live there, either. </TEXT>

It wouldn't have been that bad, but the fact that everyone was armed for bear for Y2K definitely did a lot of good in preventing the stupid things that would have happened. </TEXT>
