	<TEXT> I work at a doctor's office. At our clinic, we work mostly with children who are either autistic or have some sort of learning disability. The thanks that I get from the kids themselves after working through our program breaks my heart on a regular basis. The majority of them are very intelligent and have been told by either teachers or guardians they are not. I also have never been more appreciative of witnessing good parenting, every kid deserves unconditional love and respect. Joel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's really helpful! I noticed they sell prepaid sim cards for t-mobile. Do you think one of those would work with an unlocked phone from amazon? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry if this question has been asked before!
I am in a predicament. I am currently in the US but I am permanently moving to Germany in mid September. I don't have a contract with Verizon but I called them and they said that I could do a prepaid plan. Now, what I would like to do is buy a new unlocked phone on amazon that I can use nationally while I'm here, and then take it over there with me and use it there as well. (It would irk me to have to buy two phones in a three month time span - haha) Now, when I spoke to the verizon rep he said that it should work, but he didn't know for sure. I guess I was just wondering if anyone else had experience with buying an unlocked phone from amazon and using it with Verizon's prepaid network. Thank you so much for the help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I have definitely realized that my boyfriend doesn't know what he's talking about - haha. And I guess I must have worded the finances weird...the exchange rate is like .77 euro to the dollar and in the UK it's more like .66 gbp to the dollar </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I think my card sounds like the best option although I know that exchange when I'm over there isn't a problem because my boyfriend has the cash. Thank you so much for the advice! I really appreciate it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I have like 50 euro in cash just for when I get off the plane, but I was planning on exchanging it in Germany because then my boyfriend does it and I can just relax! haha. And YAY about your credit union card, hopefully that's what happens for me as well because that's the only card I'll be bringing. Do you think that making sure I tell my bank I'll be gone would have an impact on the fraud problems? </TEXT>
