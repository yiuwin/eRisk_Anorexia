	<TEXT> I think by "love" OP meant "the positive feeling you get by being around/thinking of someone", which is what the word means to most people. Obviously that's not what love actually is, and in the real sense of the word, marriage is based on love. As is friendship, family relations, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How these discussions always go:

"It must be right because God makes people with these desires, so they can't be wrong!"

"Okay, how about [example of inborn desire that is obviously wrong]"

"You bigot! I can't believe you just compared people's love to [example]!"


From a logical perspective it's obvious that whether or not a person is born with a desire has no bearing on whether it's a good one, but it's still a common talking point. Best to just ignore it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you give me some resources on this? Preferably official Church documents. All the references I've been able to find have been exclusively about sex and sexual relationships. Honestly I'm not even sure what difference constitutes a "romantic" relationship aside from emotional attachment to another person and desire for physical closeness, neither of which is inherently sinful for people of any orientation so long as they are chaste and divorced from lust. But I know someone who is bisexual and basically feels that if she were to fall in love with a woman then she should be able to live with her as long as they don't do anything sexual, but she feels chaste kissing, cuddling, etc. is fine since she does that with her friends anyway. I'm trying to convince her that's not how it works and getting into that sort of relationship in general is a bad idea, but it's been falling on deaf ears. She keeps "romance" and "sex" in very different spheres mentally and only agrees that sexual activity outside of marriage is wrong, and even that seems tenuous at times. She also does not see the purpose of romantic relationships as being ordered toward marriage but rather as ends in themselves whereby people can be emotionally supportive toward each other and nurture the emotion of being "in love". Are there any Church documents or anything that address why being in love is a disordered feeling when not toward a potential marriage partner? I haven't come across any such thing, and to the best of my knowledge the Church has only directly addressed sexual temptations that may arise as a result and such relationships as being near occasions of sin in that regard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it is done in accordance with the Archdiocese policies, I think this could be a good thing for the school, depending on the intentions of the people starting it. Oftentimes young people experiencing same sex attraction feel isolated and like freaks, especially among people who are religious. And the information about the actual teaching of the Church is so distorted that they may not get a clear picture of it unless it's through a club like this. Even the principal of the school thought that the club needed to advocate conversion therapy in order to be in line with Catholic teaching. Clubs like this could be a resource for those experiencing same sex attractions to learn what the Church actually teaches regarding sexuality and chastity, and be able to better integrate their sexuality properly in their own lives, as well as have others who can support them who are dealing with the same thing. 

Of course, in such clubs special care would need to be taken that they do not become hotbeds for anti-Catholic subversion or a dating service, but with proper direction this could be avoided. And it could be good practice to develop close, chaste relationships between others, since they are very likely not called to marriage if they experience exclusive same sex attraction. If they don't learn the way to integrate their sexuality and live a holy and chaste life from the Church somewhere, they will surely learn the alternative from the rest of the world. And a high school is a prime opportunity to catechize about this topic, particularly since people are coming to terms with their sexuality on all levels at that age, and need guidance whatever their own personal struggles in that area. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems more that he's saying that the couple should not be invited, and they are reading into it that he should not be invited as an individual. I can't say for sure if I agree with his approach, but I can definitely understand his perspective. If their son were living with a married woman, or with several women, or anything like that, then inviting them to family gatherings as a unit could send the impression that these relationships are normal and healthy. Now, whether it would be prudent to avoid that altogether or to simply explain the situation to those old enough to understand, as well as why you believe what you do, is a topic open for debate I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We live in a culture that has made an idol of the self. Other people are seen as a means to enrich our own lives, or else just a nuisance. I can't think of any other era in history where so many would wear the moniker of "I hate people" as a badge of honor. You have people who put all of their affection into their animals, because having to consider the needs and wants of a complex equal is too much emotional effort. So it's no surprise that the concept of parenthood is so frequently met with recoil and horror, since it requires so much sacrifice for so little material reward. You have to deal with what people see as a very inconvenient screaming ball of flesh for 18 years that will likely bring you all kinds of frustration and grief, and if your primary focus is on self-actualization and living an unfettered lifestyle to pursue your own whims, parenthood will appear to be a shackle. 

Our entire culture is at its root anti-child and anti-family, since it's anti-sacrifice. It's shocking how many people proudly declare how they don't want children, even in Catholic circles. Typically this has been an adolescent response to a fear of responsibility that people have grown out of, but much like the single-minded pursuit of the feeling of falling in love rather than accepting the sacrifices of living a life of love, people are encouraged to cling to this selfishness well into adulthood and not truly grow into a person who understands that responsibility extends beyond the self. While it is true that not all people are called to marriage and having children, the sentiment of revulsion toward the idea of marriage or children is not a healthy one even for a person called to celibacy. Even St. Francis felt a draw toward the married life.

We are a culture mired in a specific sickness involving the family, and it's the root of many of our other issues. It needs to be rooted out and replaced with a Catholic view of the person and the family in order to begin eliminating these problems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is something that we have a big problem with in the western world. There's an idea that religion is a subjective belief that should only apply to those who agree to follow it. We've placed an arbitrary distiction between religion and everything else so that when we don't like something any more we can dismiss it as part of a religion and therefore not applicable to the rest of society. When the majority agreed that marriage was between a man and a woman, there was no mention of it being a religious idea, since nearly every culture of many different religions held the same view. Now that popular opinion has shifted the opposite way, it's been deemed a religious view, and thus easily dismissable by those who don't agree. There's an association of religion with irrational belief that only applies to the person believing it.

This allows people to draw an imaginary distinction between belief systems, cosmologies, ethical frameworks, etc. by calling some of them "religions" and thus permissible to ignore. That's why you hear so many people say that religion has no place in the public square, or in politics, and that religion causes wars. It's easy to group all the things you don't like under a common umbrella, when the only thing they actually have in common is a belief in the supernatural (if even that). It's a hard-coded bias toward naturalism and materialism that has no logical backing, just a disdainful sneer toward other beliefs.

So no, I don't think it's particularly useful to group all religions together in a discussion, unless you're studying their effect on culture or something. But in practical terms, whether a belief comes from a religion or not is unrelated to whether it is right or wrong. That should be the focus. Secular humanism deserves no greater place in our law than Islam or any false religion, just because they have the moniker "religion" and it doesn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 90% of a math class thinks that 2^3 = 6, and mark it that way on a test. Better change the answer key, and while we're at it, the rules of mathematics so that it reflects what the people think. 90% disagreement may indicate poor education by the priests and bishops, or refusal to assent, but it doesn't change the truth. Every teaching in Catholicism depends on the others in a vast framework; it's impossible to reject part of it without functionally rejecting the whole thing. Many people do. Most people do. I'd wager that at least 3/4 of people in the US who identify as Catholic are, when you actually dissect their beliefs, secular humanists who happen to think Jesus was a cool guy who wanted everyone to love each other and that this "God" fellow is okay with everyone as long as they do what makes them happy and they don't hurt anyone. Believing something doesn't make it true, and thank God the Church isn't a democracy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not really sudden. Hitchens and his fans have been dragging her through the mud for years. Their criticisms all boil down to the fact that she didn't run things the way a proper secular humanist would. And you know what? They're right, such as it is. A proper secular humanist whose only concern is minimizing physical pain and increasing material well-being would have done almost everything differently than Saint Teresa did. They wouldn't have had the people in the order spending hours each day praying and making sure to have Mass. The money given to them would have been invested in medical facilities and other material goods, rather than toward more houses for the order in other parts of the world, beautifying churches, and the rest given to the Church to distribute as they see fit. A secular humanist would find this treatment of money abhorrent. Also, the fact that she saw redemptive value in suffering rather than as the be all end all of evil is something incomprehensible. 

This whole thing is basically further evidence of how divorced the Christian worldview has become from the norm. "Do good and avoid evil" has been replaced with "distribute pleasure and relieve pain." If all you believe in is the material universe, and for whatever reason still think that the chemical reactions inside a hairless primate are worth caring about, the way Saint Teresa lived her life will make no sense, and a lot of what she did will seem downright awful and opposed to what you believe. Now, I'm not saying she was perfect or made no mistakes, but the vast majority of criticism of her is just based on different fundamental assumptions of the place of humanity in the universe and the purpose of life. 

Strangely, the same people don't seem to complain much about Saint Francis, who was all about mortification and specifically told churches that they should be well adorned, particularly the sacred vessels which hold Our Lord. But he liked animals so he must have been a new age hippy, or something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me tell you, I've actually read pretty decent arguments against theism, Christianity, and Catholicism. None of them convinced me, mind you, and I can effectively mount counterarguments against them. The first thirty or so "arguments" I saw on this list, on the other hand, are pathetic and a disgrace to actual intelligent atheists. Unless they decided to hide all the interesting ones further in, I'd say that website is basically just firing birdshot and seeing what sticks. 

Also, the thing is that if we're right, then we're following the right path and doing the right thing while the atheists are being led astray. If the atheists are right, then we're all equally deluded and you might as well pick anything at random to do any given minute. Now, that's not a good argument for theism by itself, but I'd say it shows that there's no real allure behind atheism based on not wanting to "waste time" praying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Considering that the argument about baptism is literally addressed by Jesus and John the Baptist in the text itself, one wonders how they missed it except by contrived ignorance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm almost positive the answer is yes. Otherwise there wouldn't be any reason to restrict natural marriages to male/female either. The whole reason for the societal recognition of the relationship is because it creates more people by its nature. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they intend to forego children and prevent them for the entirety of their marriage, never being open to life, then they are not entering into a marriage at all. If people don't want children, they don't want marriage. Sex without being open to life is sinful, whatever form that may take. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is this the same Jesus who told several parables about how wheat would be separated from weeds, and how those who are not properly dressed will be thrown from the wedding feast, what with the wailing and gnashing of teeth? The same Jesus who came to bring the sword, and said that families would be pitted against each other for His sake? Jesus is many things, but He is not "inclusive" in the modern sense of the word. All are welcome at the feast, but not on their own terms. Those who love Jesus keep His commandments, and abstaining from fornication is one of them. This applies to everyone of every sexual orientation. 

People also seem to ignore that when preaching about marriage, Jesus cited Genesis, which not only affirms marriage as between a man and a woman, but states that the entire reason that marriage exists is because God made us male and female. God could have made us able to reproduce any number of ways. In His wisdom, He made us able to reproduce via sexual intercourse between a male and a female. The division of humans into male and female is based on their reproductive role - otherwise these categories would be unnecessary. Marriage is simply the bond between a man and a woman who have decided to engage in this special reproductive bond to co-create with God. People of the same sex can have many wonderful and fulfilling relationships with each other, but marriage is not one of them by its very definition and nature. And any sexual activity not ordered toward this reproductive bond is disordered and thus immoral. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except that there are non-sacramental marriages that are still recognized as marriages, so that term is misleading. Marriage doesn't have to occur in the Church to be a marriage. And for most of human history there has been a special pride of place for relationships between a man and a woman with the end of having and raising children. They haven't been exclusive or unbreakable in every culture, but the essential characteristics are still there. The few cultures that did not have a special recognition of marriage (whatever name it was under) typically also had a misunderstanding as to how procreation took place. And certainly, as long as the word marriage has described a thing in English, it has described a male-female exclusive sexual relationship ordered toward having and raising children. If we did not reproduce sexually as a species, there would be absolutely no reason for such a thing as marriage to exist, and certainly no reason to give people involved in one any special privileges in law or society. Marriage is an objective reality that exists independent of the adorable and misinformed opinions of the masses, so if they want to use the word to describe something wholly meaningless and without substance, then we'll just have to find a new word for the real, substantial bond between a man and a woman whose relationship is ordered toward having and raising children. </TEXT>
