	<TITLE> Formatting PGP keys on Reddit </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Note**: This has been sitting on my private test sub for awhile, and I didn't think to post it on my now gone public sub while I had it. Now that I changed over to the new userpage design, I might as well inaugurate it with this post.   
This is originally copied from [a long dead subreddit (/r/silkroad)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1seuvn/formatting_pgp_keys_on_reddit/), all credit goes to [a long gone user](/u/badwolfhosting). Hopefully this will still be useful to someone or other.

**2nd note:** To preserve original formatting I am not adding in quotation formatting (\ symbols at the beginning of each line). Everything below this comment is copied verbatim from the original post, I don't warrant that it still works (please comment and let me know if it doesn't) and any grammar or syntax issues are the original author's not mine.

We see then many, many people are including their PGP key but not formatting it correctly. Not only does this mean that your messages may not be able to be validated, but your keys are impossible for most to import without heavy editing.        
So, how do you make this:

It's quite simply really. at the end of each new line just put 4 spaces. No need to hit enter because the lines are already correct, you just need to tell reddit to separate each one. If you do not add 4 spaces then reddit appends the end of the line to the beginning of the next, no returns or spaces.       

If you prefer for it to display with code and linenums then just add 4 spaces to the beginning instead of the end.          

And if you want your big PGP key to be smaller, format it like so:

	<TEXT> For the most part I might agree with you, except some beer really is mass produced swill, Bud/Bud Light and Coors/Coors Light being the two that come to mind. You're right that that these companies can make good beer, and not just because of acquisitions, but they have a market selling beer to people who don't know or just don't care about quality, either in general or situationally (such as just wanting something cheap and marginally alcoholic while watching NASCAR. It may make business sense for them to market to those crowds, but calling them out on it is hardly snobbery, and if it is, it is IMO well justified. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're oversimplifying a bit. Large chunks of property are not going to suddenly become less expensive to purchase or rent if we made it harder or outright banned them from buying property here. It's a somewhat perverse thing, but while foreign investment almost certainly helped inflate the bubble, it's probably not going to be deflated by backing that off, at least not in the short term. </TEXT>

Being pouty about it doesn't do any good, nor does pretending like these Chinese buyers don't exist and it is, to an extent, in our best interest to bring their money into the US, even in exchange for hard assets like real estate. </TEXT>

I've had a decent amount of success with reusable dehumidifying systems. [This is the one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0XFCS) I'm using now, although it's too soon to tell how it'll hold up in the long run (I've had it 4 months and so far so good though). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll skip the empty platitudes to go right ahead to saying that this really upsets me and makes me angry. Not only does this of course hurt you, but it is an attack on the whole community, both internally for what you and others may think of transacting business with fellow silverbugs here, and externally for anyone who may be considering joining our community, whether they decide to buy or sell on pmsforsale/silverbugs or not.   

On a personal note, this is why I only tend to buy from people who have a solid history of posting here, and not just a history on pmsforsale. Not only may someone be buying and selling elsewhere with people, including private deals with silverbugs here that don't go through pmsforsale, that won't get counted in their feedback number there, but a long history in the community here is IMO a better metric and harder/more work for a scammer to fake than a few small trades over there to boost their feedback number. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And now that other sellers they can't charge as much. It's still pretty shitty to nakedly gouge your customers for over twice fair price (in this case the price relative to the **5** previous rounds in the series) when they were the only seller, and they IMO should not be rewarded for it with further business. That's the reason I'll keep calling them out whenever they're mentioned.    
If I thought it would make a difference, and more to the point, that I had the willpower to actually follow through with it, I would be boycotting and campaigning against Elemetal (the makers of the Privateer series) too, since they are complicit in choosing to wholesale to a seller that engages in bad behavior. I'm not going to kid myself though, I'll buy their rounds nearly every time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You contradicted yourself there, if the business has a vested interest in not having to hire new workers to replace pregnant ones then regulating them to force them to behave in a certain way is unnecessary and redundant.    
People are not going to stop having kids because the government doesn't legislate benefits for pregnant women, most of human history backs that up, leaving your only real valid argument being the societal good when little Billy Jr gets born anyway because his parents either purposefully or accidentally had unprotected sex. That leaves our point of contention, as I see it, as to whether everyone else (because you're kidding yourself if you don't think business costs don't get passed on to consumers and the other burdens from light duty workers don't get passed on to co-workers) should have to pay for the "right" to procreate. </TEXT>

The problem with that though, is that such discussions have always devolved into charging fat people more and diabetics more for bad diets, it's tough to figure out a line on risky behavior, not to mention create a policy around it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they're not using precautions then why should we, individually or as a society, treat it any different than if they were doing it on purpose?    

There are legitimate arguments to be made regarding the fact that a lot of people don't get even basic sex ed and the lack of contraceptive availability, but at the end of the day, personal responsibility is personal responsibility and have have pretty close to zero sympathy for anyone who isn't using protection and not trying to get pregnant but gets pregnant anyway after voluntarily and willingly having sex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difference is people aren't trying to break their legs. Also, IMO when it comes to accidents, there is a distinction between doing something that may break your legs, and doing something that has a decently high chance (if done without protection and birth control) of getting someone pregnant. Admittedly that's a generalization, since women still get pregnant sometimes when taking precautions (although the rate is well under 1% if I remember correctly if using both birth control and condoms), but it still holds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As for you last question, you are required to follow any ATC command when within controlled airspace, whether VFR or IFR (91.123)   

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the one, and to my knowledge only one, superseding rule, 91.3(b), which states:  
 In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot in command may deviate from any rule of this part to the extent required to meet that emergency.

That isn't an excuse to ignore ATC; however, it does preclude the responsibility to follow their instructions in case of a declared (or even I guess a non-declared) emergency, although if you don't let them know what's going on that'll make it worse off for everyone. </TEXT>

1) It's not late, it's just incredibly early. Where I am it's about 0330. If you disagree, then I'll be happy to invite you to some eccentric person's house with a bunch of strangers and we can see who survives the night :)   

2) While I will agree that Clue may very well never have happened if Murder by Death hadn't happened, I tend to think that your statement that parodies build on the parodies before them is at best overly simplistic. I'm not going to ask you to source your statements, since, as you said, it is incredibly late, or at least very early, but I would say that there's a lot more to it than that, especially since parody had to start somewhere so some parodies are not building on previous works other than what they're directly parodying. </TEXT>

Murder by Death on the other hand spoofs the genre, but is more specifically a parody of a specific set of works, and less specifically a few well known murder mystery authors through their most famous characters. </TEXT>

If the infraction wasn't intentional or malicious and the pilot shows a good faith effort to accept what they did and learn from it so they don't do it again, the FAA now has no interest in punishing people for these issues.   
That being said, they were perfectly honest about the fact that they know they have serious trust issues with pilots, especially people who have been pilots for a long time, because of their previous stance towards punishment, and that it will take a good amount of time to build up trust. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why should they get coverage and why should viewers be interested in them? They are one of many countries with oppressive dictatorial rulers, they are one of dozens of countries where the populace is starving, they have little economic impact right now and their collapse is not going to a adversely affect the day to day lives of citizens of any country outside of theirs, except conceivably their neighbors such as Brazil. It may be incredibly selfish, but we have our own problems, and there is no reason to care about theirs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The local FSDO folks came up to Palo Alto a few days ago and did a seminar on "Compliance Philosphy" (the actual name of the seminar), that they are really serious about doing away with enforcement actions unless they really have to.    

They also stated that the clock for how often you can use immunity (I believe you can only invoke it once every 4 years) if applicable/usable (i.e. you do something that doesn't fall under one of the exceptions to immunity), only starts if they actually do something that is considered an enforcement action. They have pretty much, but not entirely gotten rid of the letters of warning and are trying to be a much more education focused (but they stressed, not necessarily a  "kinder and gentler" government agency).    

In short, from what I took away and can surmise, is that anything that is educational, like the FSDO re-educating, talking to a pilot on the phone or in person about what they did wrong, or a requirement that the pilot go to an instructor and get retrained on a given area, is now not considered an enforcement action for the purposes of starting the clock as it is not sent to Oklahoma City or put on the pilot's file. It is kept on with the FSDO, but that seems to be it (whether it counts as enforcement that can be waived/avoided through an ASRS report, I don't know). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth NZ Mint The Wise? I thought not. Its not a story the Jedi would tell you. Its a Sith legend. Darth NZ Mint was a Mint from a land down under, so powerful and so wise they could use famous IP to influence the public to buy anything they might want to sell They had such a knowledge of the dark side of minting that they could even keep shit coin series they didn't care about from dying.   
The dark side of minting is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. They became so powerful the only thing they were afraid of was losing this power, which eventually, of course, they did. Fortunately, even apprentices know everything they knew, when other mints kill them in their sleep for hawking shitty products with iconic imagery, it will be it will be ironic. They could save others from death, but not themselves. </TEXT>

Edit: I'm not tiring of them anytime soon though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the early days of bitcoin I was wrong, very very wrong about it dropping back down (a mistake that in retrospect cost me at least several hundred thousand dollars in potentially realized gains). That being said, every time it has gone past $1200 it has settled back down and there is no reason to think that this is anything different.   
There is absolutely nothing to support the higher price point right now, no news, no new innovation or usage, so this is a pretty clear bubble. </TEXT>
