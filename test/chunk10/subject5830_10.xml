	<TEXT> My brother has the HD 600's and the 10x price range is questionable. The HD 600's are better but when you think you're paying close to 300 for the headphones *and* you need an amp/dac. Its a crazy price jump for how close they sound.

And don't hesitate to buy a pair, so cheap and so good, especially if you want them as backup headphones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bought these for 27 from Amazon and they are so clean sounding. They're like the HD 600's little brother. 

They sound criminally good for their price range and are require no amp (although they get a little bit meatier with one).

I use them mainly for my PS4 as I can plug directly into the pad and they are so light and don't feel fatiguing after a long use.

I think every headphone enthusiast needs a pair of these. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sorry if this isn't the best place to ask this but I really know where else to ask and thought some history buffs may have a clue.

I Birmingham, UK they found an SC250 bomb and safely detonated it. I was wondering how much power they actually have and how much damage it would have caused today if it went off properly.

The [bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC250_bomb) in question and the [news](https://twitter.com/search?q=aston+bomb ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch) if you don't know about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is a very probable situation. As far as I know it was something my dad was very used to doing after work when he got home. My dad has always done physical jobs and I think back then he was a pub doorman for many years so he was probably fairly tired both mentally and physically after a long day. That could have easily made him think something happened, especially if he was expecting it.

But saying all that though and me being open minded; my dad is a very level headed guy so I hope it's not just tiredness that affected him that day :)  </TEXT>

But saying that I have 99.9% belief that my mom and dad are telling the truth in what they witnessed as they are very real people who have never played a joke on me or my 3 brothers growing up and it's something that was only mentioned during an immediate family gathering when we were all having some drinks. It's not like they bought it up randomly like they'd both planned it. It was almost like they waited until we were all grown up to tell it. </TEXT>

One time me and my dad thought we saw a weird shadow in our house and she was scared and didn't want us to talk about it as she hates ghost related things so I can't imagine her pranking my dad and still telling it to me 20+ years after it supposedly happened. She's really not that kind of person. She's very pessimistic about things and doesn't have the best sense of humour. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bit of a clearer [image](http://i.imgur.com/O3c4AIw.png) from that clip if it helps anyone. I've tried reverse google searching it with no luck.

Also if you look carefully in the YouTube video you can see that the blue in the game moves slightly and looks like a blue torch or a cone of vision.

**Edit: The more I look at it I think its the "death screen" of a game before you spawn back in. I don't think its a top-down game. Possibly an FPS and that's the screen you seen when you wait to spawn back in.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the idea but the one handed sword doesn't feel right for the damage its doing. He seems to hold it too effortlessly yet it destroys the enemies.

Maybe if it was double handed that it would feel more natural when he's swinging it about? </TEXT>

I've tried many good pairs headphones now and feel my hearing has matured more to listening to certain sounds so I would like to try the 770s again at some point. </TEXT>
