	<TEXT> Thank you! I've been giving those little brushes a workout. The book I got is a Stillman   Birn Beta series. All I've been using to paint on was the cheapest of cheap paper from Hobby Lobby and I was dying to try something a little better after getting more confident and recognizing the shortcomings of the cheap pads. 

As I've laid out, I'm not really familiar with a lot of paper but I find it really terrific. It's cold-press but the texture is much less pronounced than the other paper I've tried so it doesn't get in the way of the tiny details on these tiny foods. I do a fair amount of scrubbing and lifting and I have yet to start tearing up spots and pulling up fuzzy bits of paper. It works like a champ. I'm curious to try out some books, but I'm glad to have found a good quality journal I can pick up locally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks very much. That's a personal challenge for me with all these. I enjoy painting realistically and sometimes that can kinda be at odds with choosing watercolor! But I decided I wanted to tackled these with as much effort and eye for detail as I would something on letter size paper. It's more fun and satisfying for me, and in the long run it'll be good training for approaching details on larger paintings. The values are something else I'm very conscious of. Just like watercolor can sometimes fight you on adding detail, it can be defy strong contrasts and deep values so I'm always trying to push that and go a step or two further with some dark, pigment loaded strokes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought a new pocket sketchbook and decided to make it a dedicated tiny food book. I don't always have the most consistent, wide open chunks of time to paint, so sticking with a tiny portrait of a single object has made it much easier to complete a painting in a single sitting or two and get that sweet, sweet sense of accomplishment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A game is a game, the fun is being in control of the story and feel like you're the protagonist. A game isn't a movie, but with stuff like this it doesn't feel much different than putting a movie up on YouTube. And we all know the studios would shit their pants at the idea of their new movie showing up on YouTube the Friday it opened. The same is said for movie/TV pirates, that they were never going to be a paying customer anyway, so what's the harm if movies do show up online for free. 

I don't really have a concrete point, other than I'm just surprised how cavalier game studios are compared to Hollywood.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watch lots of gaming videos, but I'm realizing now when I actually think about it, I only watch "engine" type games like Civilization or Crusader Kings or Cities Skylines. I've never sought out any narrative games and saw how commonplace it was. 

I guess it's true that I have no intention of buying the game and so I'm fine with watching. Where as if it was a game like this I was interested in, I definitely wouldn't watch and have the story spoiled for me. Seems kinda like a catch-22(or some figure of speech I can't quite come up with), companies allow it because it's free publicity but the people watching are people who were never going to buy. So...that doesn't quite add up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps an easier way to fix things, at least according to me..the armchair expert TV writer, would've been to limit her rewriting to that last year or so. Not swap David and Mark, or make her mom gay and undo portions of the entire series. Her coping with Dan's death is like a gut-punch and wonderful, but everything tampered with prior to that feels thrown in unnecessarily. 

I forgot to mention Roseanne wanting to be a writer early on. With that idea existing from the very beginning, and her just attempting to "fix" that last season...I think it would've been more appreciated </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It probably wouldn't be as polarizing if...say, 85% of the show wasn't grounded and depressing. Until the lottery, the show was never hinted to be anything but a realistic look at a wiring class family. The ending was certainly something just thought up in the last season. It would've benefited from more outlandish or fanciful ideas being introduced or amplified steadily as the show progressed. Like Roseanne wanted to write an honest memoir, but realized it was too bleak and needed some spicing up along the way. That would've made the finale more acceptable and more satisfying. As it stands, all it does is make the shittiest season almost palatable, drop in maybe one good, emotional ret con and then erase or make you question a lot of what you enjoyed about the story. I feel very moved by the finale, but it also feels like cheap, unearned manipulation.

The only element, off the top of my head..it's been a few years since I've seen a lot of the show, I could maybe accept as fitting my suggestion and  feeling fictional during the run of the show would be the Halloween episodes, where any money or time concerns seem to be entirely forgotten. But that's more likely attributed to Roseanne probably just being a big fan of Halloween and wanting to have fun with those episodes, and not towards any grand plan with the show's overall narrative. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, yes...I think everyone gets that seeing a real painting is better than a book. This isn't a difficult concept to grasp. It applies to basically everything in life. We get it. But not everyone can see every painting in the world with their own eyes. They have accepted the fact that a reproduction may be their only option. Or believe it's perfectly fine to enjoy an art book until they get the opportunity to visit the right museums. No one is going too argue that you're wrong and their book was a better experience than seeing the real deal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always liked miniature paintings/drawings like those Lorraine Loots and others create, so I thought I'd try to take a stab at doing a mini-burger. I have problems getting shaky when doing detail work and figured this could be a good exercise to try to remedy and calm that tendency. Also good practice at making tiny, tiny lines and shapes with watercolor and see just how small I could get and still keep things defined and clear. I thought about using colored pencils at the end to finish details and textures but I decided to stick to watercolor and push it to see how intricate I could get with paints alone.

	<TEXT> Reminds me of shop class where we were using these little razor choppers, like the heavy duty paper cutters but just with a small razor blade in the arm, to chop lengths of balsa wood. The teacher explained that we just had to be careful and work slowly and we wouldn't get hurt, if we cut ourselves we were idiots. A couple weeks later my partner somehow cut himself and went up to the teacher and said, "I'm an idiot." Best way to break the news. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another of my monthly cheeseburgers, a couple weeks late. I had serious qualms and frustrations with this one near the middle and couldn't get motivated to work.

For no real reason, I decided to paint a burger each month as a kinda progress report and see how I'm improving and learning. The burger was chosen at random, but it's a pretty good subject to practice and experiment with-multiple types of textures and a variety of colors.

I try to approach each one a little differently, with this one I wanted to break free from the ink outlines I've done with every other painting and just rely on paint. No ink and no white gel pens at the end. That meant this was also the first time I used making fluid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The real hook of the game is being able to pay with a lot of people easily since almost everyone has a smart phone and being able to do things like type and draw much quicker than you would on any game controller. There's no advantage in being locked into using the joy cons.

There is still a great advantage to having it on switch though, since it'll be the ultimate portable version of the game and super easy to bring to parties and gatherings where you have the largest number off potential players. It's genius. </TEXT>

And to see this narcissistic garbage person so used to being surrounded by sycophants taken down several notches and have to leave his delusional bubble and face reality. 

This is like half the plane giving a baboon the flight stick and when he unsurprisingly throws the plane into a nosedive, finding some small glimmer of hope when it looks like someone might be able to tranq it and pull the front up before kissing the ground.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I get it, I just think it's an awfully convenient way to go about it for the filmmakers. Toss in enough stuff to bring in book fans but they also don't have to deal with the burden and expectations of being an adaptation and can invent and change whatever they want to. They get to take advantage of a built in fanbase and at the same time almost have the freedom of their own IP. 

Just because they are going this route and have this freedom with the narrative doesn't mean criticism is unjustified. They can, and it sounds like they certainly have in some instances, add in stupid ideas that deserved to be called out. </TEXT>
