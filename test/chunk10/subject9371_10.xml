	<TEXT> The *Libro de Sermones Varios en Lengua Quiche* (1690) offers a fascinating glimpse into a story of colonial resistance, and preserves examples related to the Kiche language that have offered considerable help in improving our understanding of both this tumultuous era and the development of that language under colonial rule. The manuscript has been newly digitized, and it's quite a beautiful artifact even apart from its contents -- well worth a look. </TEXT>

- *Baru Cormorant* has a sequel that the author is working on as we speak, but it's not out yet -- maybe next year?

- *Sarantium* is followed up by a single sequel, *Lord of Emperors*. GGK has several other books set in the same world, but they have no necessary or direct connections to each other -- just occasional references.

- Connolly's book is a standalone, as is Addison's.

- There are rumours that Novik is working on a sequel to *Uprooted*, but we don't know much of anything about it yet. It works just fine as a standalone anyhow. </TEXT>

1. Seth Dickinson - *The Traitor Baru Cormorant*: A young girl's home is colonized by a heartless empire and she decides that the only solution is to try to take that empire over from within -- by becoming an accountant.

2. Guy Gavriel Kay - *Sailing to Sarantium*: In a story loosely based on events from the reign of the Byzantine emperor Justinian, an unassuming artisan is asked to travel to the capital to create the most elaborate mosaic the world has ever seen. Unfortunately, many, *many* people have really serious objections to this...

3. John Connolly - *The Book of Lost Things*: In a brutally dark inversion of conventional stories about plucky children travelling to fantasy worlds through mysterious doorways, a mentally ill child during the height of the Blitz in WWII ends up in a nightmare realm where the worst versions of fairy-tale characters do the worst things possible.

4. Katherine Addison - *The Goblin Emperor*: In stark contrast to the above, a kind-hearted and inexperienced teenager is unexpectedly given the throne of a vast empire. He learns -- sometimes the hard way -- who he can trust, what he can do, and what his ultimate purpose might be.

5. Naomi Novik - *Uprooted*: A wizard, a tower, a dragon, a prince, an enchanted wood, and an unlikely heroine. None of what I've just said turns out anything like you'd expect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tom smiled as his friend joined him on the familiar bench at the park. The stream of life flowed by them in the form of parents and children, lovers and friends, colleagues and strangers. The two men sat in silence for a moment, taking it all in.

The older man reached into his coat pocket and removed a small rectangular package, wrapped in brown paper. His newly arrived friend received it with his usual courteous confusion; the package was nondescript but for the number **3973** written across the front in black ink. The younger man opened his briefcase and slid the package in with a sigh.

"Tom..." he began, finally initiating an exchange he'd rehearsed a hundred times. "I think you know what I'm going to ask you."

Tom nodded, smiling.

"This is the same thing as usual, right?"

Another nod.

"Yankees versus Mariners, Oct. 8, 1995?"

The same smile.

"Tom, you know I'd do anything for you, and I've been receiving this strange little bit of baseball history from you every day now for over a decade. Never complained, never asked questions. But..." he shrugged, giving up; "I just have to know... *why*?"

Tom settled back and looked at the river. A group of teenagers were passing by on the opposite shore in a canoe, laughing and shouting at each other. Ducks landed and took off. Clouds were clouds.

"I guess I do have one small confession to make," said Tom, turning to his friend. A moment of anticipation stretched out, and then -- "Do you know that I've been making video recordings of this game with Major League Baseball's implied oral consent, but *without* its express written consent?"

If the younger man was scandalized by this, he concealed it heroically. His dissatisfaction with the answer was less easy to hide.

"But why on earth have you been copying the same game for over ten years and giving it to me? Nobody even uses tapes anymore; this must be costing you a fortune."

Tom turned once more to look out over the path and the river, with all its pageant of happy humanity passing by.

"Well," said Tom, "let's just call it your good deed for the day." </TEXT>

There are so many stories about warriors, wizards, thieves, even bards -- but what about people with other jobs? Engineers? Bureaucrats? Farmers? Innkeepers (not Kvothe)? Chefs! Chefs especially would be really interesting.

	<TEXT> One question that may matter is whether you've read any Guy Gavriel Kay before. *Tigana* will make a great introduction to his body of work, if not! There's lots more there to explore afterwards. *Jonathan Strange* is also great, but there's pretty much nowhere else to go with Susanna Clarke after that apart from *The Ladies of Grace Adieu*. I mention this because the other things you've included in your original post are all series, some of them quite long; if you're looking for another to get into, *Tigana* is the way to go (though admittedly not all of Kay's books are actually connected, but many are set in the same world).

Anyway: both are fantastic, but I say *Tigana*. </TEXT>

I'm a great fan of Alfred the Great, and it was very moving to see him adapted so.

Even more amazingly, the book was *successfully translated into English* in 1995 by Gilbert Adair, still following the same rule. The result, *A Void*, is a delightful noir mystery (of sorts) that you might like to check out if you can find it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a fun anecdote about a WWI signaller from the memoirs of Anthony French of the 15th London; it's one of my favourites:

 One spark of humour could set a whole column alight.

 We approached a signaller industriously repairing a broken line and a voice cried: "Some say 'Good old Signals!'" to which a second voice replied: "Others say '... old Signals!'"  The verb was irrelevant and its execution biologically absurd, but the couplet was invariable whoever might be the "good old this" or "good old that."  It was always the curious colloquial adjective "old" that preserved the affection.

 The signaller took no heed.

 "He's going up the 'line,'" someone suggested.

 "Lend 'im your button 'ook," said another.

 The signaller turned and shouted with feigned surprise,

 "Oh!  It's the bloody infantry.  What *you* doing up the line, anyway?"

 "We're looking for the GPO."

 "Lookin' for bloody trouble, you mean," said the signaller, raising a fist.

 Another voice shouted: "What did you do in the Great War, Daddy?" and from somewhere came the oft-repeated quip: "Hold your tongue, son, and polish up those medals!"...

 "Medals?" cried another; "I've spat 'em before breakfast!"

 Someone tried to sing "Give me the switch Miss for Ipswich, it's the Ipswich switch which I require," but meter and pace failed to register, so Maxwell raised his voice and set the column singing:

    *"Kitty, Kitty, isn't it a pity in the City you work so hard*

    *With your 'One, two, three four five six seven eight Gerrard?'*

    *Kitty, Kitty, isn't it a pity that you're wasting so much time*

    *With your lips close to the telephone when they might be close to mine?"*

 My last sight of the field-telephone man was of his face wreathed in smiles and his hand waving a friendly farewell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to suggest Georges Perec's *La Vie mode d'emploi* (1978; published in English as *Life: A User's Manual* in 1987). It is arguably the greatest work of one of the heroes of modern French literature, and it combines the challenging with the ludic in a way that few other novels have achieved.

The novel is set primarily on a single day (June 23, 1975) in an apartment block in Paris. It tells a series of interconnecting stories about the different inhabitants of these apartments, many of whom have quite unusual or unexpected backgrounds or relationships. This is a fairly vague description, I know, but this is a novel that is almost impossible to summarize in terms of *plot*. 

Perec was a member of the *Oulipo* school, which in general terms tended towards the production of playful and unexpected literature that conformed to certain self-imposed writing restrictions. An early example of this kind of thing from another Oulipo supporter is Raymond Queneau's *Exercises in Style* (1947; English 1958), which sees the same banal story told in ninety-nine different ways -- as a sonnet, a court document, noir thriller, dialogue, etc. Perec's own *La Disparition* (1969; English in 1995 as *A Void*), as another prominent example, is a humourous noir novel that tells a completely coherent story without ever using the letter "e." That Gilbert Adair was able to translate this into English with more or less complete success, while maintaining the same omission, is a miracle.

Perec's *Life* was composed using a series of randomized lists of things and ideas which he then synthesized into still-more randomized lists, each of which lent a fundamental set of images, characters, and events to each respective chapter. So, for example, he might have a list of tools, a list of books, a list of foods, etc. -- and then randomly choose an entry from each list, the whole group of which would then meaningfully appear in a given chapter.

There are other structural considerations. The novel is set in an apartment block featuring 100 distinct rooms arranged on a 10x10 grid, and each of the book's 99 chapters focuses on a different room (and the omission of one does matter to the story, as you will discover). Perec sets a pattern of movement throughout the building based on the "knight's tour" in chess, which sees the whole board eventually traversed through the moves of the knight piece, never landing on the same square twice. He has traded the chess board's 8x8 grid for 10x10 instead, but the results are still remarkable.

This is a novel that is witty, warm, brilliant, and -- miraculously -- at once both technically staggering and casually interesting. Virtually every chapter is fun to read just on its own, but when taken together in the system Perec has devised it all becomes something much more extraordinary. Had Borges been French and somewhat more of a democrat, I feel that this is a book he might like to have written.

**TL;DR:** Hilarious, complicated adventures involving chess, jigsaw puzzles, international intrigue, and god knows what else. </TEXT>

 The Indian was next and he said, "I am ready. I have repented my sins and soon I will be in heaven with Christ my savior. Now I must die like a man." If you are like me you probably think of Indians as heathens, but I will ask you to recall the thief on the cross. He was never baptized and never even heard of a catechism and yet Christ himself promised him a place in heaven.

 [...]

 With no more ado Maledon sprung the trap and the hinged doors fell open in the middle and the three killers dropped to judgment with a bang. A noise went up from the crowd as though they had been struck a blow. The two white men gave no more signs of life. They spun slowly around on the tight creaking ropes. The Indian jerked his legs and arms up and down in spasms. That was the bad part and many in the crowd turned in revulsion and left in some haste, and we were among them.

 We were told that the Indian's neck had not been broken, as was the case with the other two, and that he swung there and strangled for more than a half an hour before a doctor pronounced him dead and had him lowered. They say the Indian had lost weight in jail and was too light for a proper job. I have since learned that Judge Isaac Parker watched all his hangings from an upper window in the Courthouse. I suppose he did this from a sense of duty. There is no knowing what is in a man's heart. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is debate on this subject given that his public and private positions often seem to be at odds, but I can provide at least one notable example of his thoughts on this subject from only a year after the end of WWI. 

By way of providing background for other readers: the Kaiser notably abandoned the throne near the war's end, choosing to flee with some of his family and retainers to the Netherlands, where he would live in increasing poverty for the rest of his life. The whole history of that flight and the response of the Imperial German hierarchy to it has become suffused with what is known as the *Dolchstolegende*, or "stab-in-the-back-myth" -- a highly suspect reading of the war's final year or so that blamed the German people's waning morale and failure to support their Emperor and his army for Germany's defeat. Particular blame was attached to those who had helped foment the Revolution that attended Germany's final collapse, with republican and socialist blocs successfully establishing a new civil government and making the Kaiser's abdication desirable in the first place. You can find out a great deal more about this mythic reading of the war's end [here](http://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/stab-in-the-back_myth) -- and I will hasten to add that the venue itself, *The International Encyclopedia of the First World War*, is a dynamic and ever-expanding project run by many of the top scholars in the field. Their work in providing overviews of important topics for the layman during these years of centenary has been exemplary, and keeps growing outward.

There is no doubt that these events played a critical role in the collapse of imperial control over Germany, but there is also considerable and necessary debate about the degrees to which these uprisings and even mutinies -- as in the case of the fleet at Kiel in the face of a suicidal attack order against the British Royal Navy -- were reactive rather than proactive. It also badly undercuts the authority of the German army and its staff, about which I am regrettably able to say little more at the moment.

Anyway, the Kaiser and his attendants left during the last days of the war, and the Treaty of Versailles was concluded about seven months later in June of 1919. There had been serious debate over whether or not the Kaiser could or should be apprehended for his "crimes" (I offset this in quotation marks to acknowledge widespread debate) and subjected to possibly capital punishment; in the end, he never was.

All of this left him in what might charitably called a bitter frame of mind, and it is within this context that we must consider the following:

There is a particularly damning letter from him to [Field Marshal August von Mackensen](http://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/mackensen_august_von) from only a year after Wilhelm's abdication -- dated to December 2nd, 1919, to be exact. Here I quote from extracts translated in John Rhl's *The Kaiser and his Court: Wilhelm II and the Government of Germany* (Cambridge; 1994):

 "The deepest, most disgusting shame ever perpetrated by a people in history, the Germans have done unto themselves. Egged on and misled by the tribe of Judah whom they hated, who were guests among them! That was their thanks! Let no German ever forget this, nor rest until these parasites have been destroyed and exterminated from German soil! This poisonous mushroom on the German oak-tree!" He called for a "regular international all-worlds pogrom  la Russe" as "the best cure." "Jews and Mosquitoes" were "a nuisance that humanity must get rid of in some way or other," he proclaimed, and added, again in his own hand: "I believe the best would be gas."

The ominous quality of these extracts is hard to ignore.

In any event, for a wider view on all of this, I would recommend checking out this [helpfully-transcribed segment of Rhl's book](http://www.vlib.us/wwi/resources/archives/texts/t050404/will.html) detailing the Kaiser's relationship with Jews and Judaism throughout his career. It is not entirely comprehensive, but it gives a great deal more than I can provide here. Not all of it is as bad as the above, but not all of it is better, either. I've focused on the quoted passage because it looks to an earlier context than the one you initially provided, and because it dovetails so horribly with eventual historical events.

Interestingly enough, the Kaiser's [*Memoirs*](https://archive.org/details/kaisersmemoirsw00empegoog) (1922) have virtually nothing to say about the Jews or Judaism at all. He has one brief mention of a German Jewish journalist who he feels wronged someone and eventually suffered for it, but otherwise has little else to say beyond suggesting that much of the Old Testament should only be taken as Jewish-historical documentation rather than wholly divinely inspired. The *Memoirs* themselves are well worth reading apart from this or any particular issue, however -- they're absolutely fascinating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a lot of it! *The Educated Soldier* was a turning-point in both the war's historiography and the popular understanding of Haig, and it was his integration of the ideas found in this biography into the BBC's *Great War* documentary series (in part) that caused Liddell Hart to resign from the program's advisory board in such a sensational fashion.

The book does show its age, now, having been published in 1963, but there's so much in it to like. Terraine gets down into many very specific documents from both Haig and those surrounding him that had fallen beyond the remit of earlier treatments. 

It falls at an important intermediary point in the legacy of Haig biographies, when it comes down to it; Haig never got around to producing his own memoirs before he died in 1928, significantly, so many of the earlier evaluations of his legacy had to be produced by very partisan figures. Liddell Hart's early evaluation of him in *Reputations* (1928) held considerable sway, as did the venomous account provided in Lloyd George's *War Memoirs* (1933) -- Haig accounted for *four columns* of that work's index, amazingly, and the entries absolutely weren't "Haig, Douglas -- why he's so great." On the other side of this gulf we might find Brig. Gen. John Charteris' *Field Marshal Haig* (1929), a work of almost hero-worship from one of Haig's top aides. Duff Cooper (Viscount Norwich)'s two-volume biography (1935-36) was also warmly positive, but had the distinction of having access to Haig's personal diaries for the first time -- a useful but still suspect consequence of the volumes having been commissioned by Lady Haig.

Biographies and evaluations of Haig after Terraine's volume had to take his work into account, as he did more than anyone to apply a less hysterical/political/emotional view to the late Field Marshal's tenure than previous volumes had managed, one way or another. You've already mentioned Sheffield's (excellent) biography (2011) as a leading example of the revised view of "Butcher Haig's" legacy, and to that we might also add Walter Reid's undeceivingly positive appraisal in *Douglas Haig: Architect of Victory* (2007). The tide does seem to be turning in the late C-in-C's favour, with the most critical modern appraisals of him relying on much older scholarship. Still, when it comes to the more positive approach to his career, you will find all modern scholars united in their debt to Terraine's groundbreaking work.

	<TEXT> Neat! I'll track that article down; thanks very much.

Incidentally, I had seen your debate with what I'll take the liberty of calling a Joshi Denier recently, and I can sympathize readily. One of the most game-changing figures in anglophone WWI historiography was John Terraine, who for much of his career was both an independent scholar and almost worryingly prolific. While his indisputably employed successors have carved out a much less assailable niche for themselves, one still sometimes encounters people dismissing Terraine's work out of hand because of the fact that he had to produce it without formal institutional support (and even some actual opposition in the form of Sir Basil Liddell Hart, the malevolent mid-century pontiff of WWI history). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an absolute falsehood, and I am sick to death of seeing fellow Canadians propagate it.

The army responsible for the sack of Washington arrived in Chesapeake Bay from their previous campaign in *Spain* via an Atlantic passage stopping at Bermuda. I would be legitimately surprised if any of them had ever set foot in what is now called Canada before, to say nothing of them being "Canadians."

Many Canadians seem to have this vision of burly voyageurs and coureurs de bois coming down the Potomac in birchbark canoes and setting the White House ablaze with cinders from their pipes, but it was British marines who did it, and who were fresh off of having done much the same thing throughout the Iberian peninsula over the past several years.

Oddly enough, given that some two hundred of the British troops who landed were members of the Colonial Marine Corps -- that is, black former slaves from the Caribbean brought into military service -- it might actually be more accurate to say that freed black men had a bigger hand in burning down the White House than the Canadians did. They even led one of the firing parties. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's true that executions of the sort described were comparatively rare, though formal sentences of death were still quite numerous: over 3000 were handed out in the British Army over the course of the war. Still, Around 90% of them were commuted to some other punishment once they reached the Commander-in-Chief's desk, with the result that executions for various crimes accounted for 346 deaths out of the ~700,000 total incurred by the British during the war.

Still, you're right that stories about such things -- whether from British or other perspectives -- make up a non-trivial portion of the media surrounding the war. The film *Paths of Glory* is an extremely prominent example, as is the lesser known *King and Country.* German deserters are executed in *War Horse*; an escaped Russian prisoner-of-war faces a similar fate in Arnold Zweig's *The Case of Sergeant Grischa*. And then there's A.P. Herbert's *The Secret Battle*, some parts of Robert Graves' *Good-Bye to All That*, one especially infamous episode of *Blackadder Goes Forth*, and many others besides.

Part of the reason for the prominence of these incidents in media about the war has to do, I think, with how they magnify the wider discourse surrounding the conflict's purported futility and barbarity. There could scarcely be a more potent image of the First World War's trivial brutality than armies killing their own soldiers to prove a point of some sort, and stories like this allow for complex moral debates about duty, honour, cowardice, justice, and other related subjects that a more combat-oriented war story might not necessarily encompass.

Paradoxically, in being contemporarily unusual -- and thus more distinct from the norm -- they have subsequently become almost typical. 

This has happened with many aspects of the war, if I may be frank. Cyril Falls, in his survey/polemic *War Books* (1930), argued that the then-prominent crop of war literature was having a narrowing effect on popular memory of the war. "The writers have set themselves," he argues, "not to strip war of its romancefor that was pretty well gone alreadybut to prove that the Great War was engineered by knaves or fools on both sides, that the men who died in it were driven like beasts to the slaughter, and died like beasts, without their deaths helping any cause or doing any good." His main complaint about all of this is leveled against the manner in which historical fiction contracts the whole into a more intense and dynamic part, creating sensationalism and even absurdity where none might have existed before. There is a fine line between including "realistic" details for the sake of verisimilitude and including every "realistic" detail that can be imagined:

 . . . the falsest of false evidence is produced in another way: by closing-up scenes and events which in themselves may be true. Every sector becomes a bad one, every working-party is shot to pieces; if a man is killed or wounded his brains or his entrails always protrude from his body; no one ever seems to have a rest. [ . . . ] Attacks succeed one another with lightning rapidity. The soldier is represented as a depressed and mournful spectre helplessly wandering about until death brought his miseries to an end."

Put another way, because the war is popularly conceived of as being one of the worst and stupidest things ever, a considerable amount of media devoted to it concerns itself with those events that seem themselves the worst and most stupid parts of it. You will look in vain for First World War media that tells the story of a typical day in the life of a common soldier, which was mostly an unending pageant of boredom and idle conversation punctuated by brief moments of panic. In spite of the fact that basically competent officers working to the best of their abilities were the norm on all sides of the conflict, one struggles to find media about the war that tells their story; it is instead a sea of tyrants and martinets and frauds and cowards, because these make for better drama and give a clearer shine to the heroism of our subaltern protagonists when they resist them.

There has also been a considerable political angle to the prominence of these stories. In the United Kingdom, at least, there have been ongoing campaigns to secure official posthumous pardons for those subjected to such sentences -- and [at least one](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1526437/Pardoned-the-306-soldiers-shot-at-dawn-for-cowardice.html) has been successful. This is a wound that has been kept open, in short, and very much in the public mind; it's only natural that media about the war -- especially that which is trying to be "gritty" and "powerful" and "unflinching" about "the horrors" of the conflict -- should turn to such cases instead of stories about regular dudes telling each other bawdy jokes between bouts of ditch-digging while they wait to be rotated back to a rest area.

To express the matter briefly, these sorts of narratives have become so prominent because they're the kind that makes the moral reader rear back and mutter an expletive: they are compelling rather than boring, unusual rather than mundane, and searingly symbolic rather than uninterestingly typical. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In those days after the lapsing of DORA, it seemed the duty of every pub to be open just a little bit later, of its lights to burn just a little bit brighter, of its ale to be just a little bit stronger -- making up, as it were, for those years of privation. Men gathered to talk, as in the old days, but even with the war concluded it was still on everyone's lips. What were the bloody Russians up to now? When would the next cemetery be consecrated? Where were all the jobs that had been promised?

What did everyone expect? And what did everyone remember?

The one-time private Thomas Atkins, now demobbed, sat in his usual place by the fire at the Princess Helena. He massaged his left leg absently -- a bullet on the Somme had left a deep gouge there in '16, and in cold weather the wound always made sure to remind him of its presence. Other former messmates from the East ______ers shared the table, swapping stories from their time in the line and recalling the days that had been, if in no way wonderful, at least the most vivid and consequential of their comparatively young lives. Men were made in those trenches even as others were unmade -- and sometimes in the same instant.

David Powys-Jones, whose overt Welshness nobody ever let him forget, had once again managed to produce an awkward silence. This was his habit, and usually by using language that would have made even a colour sergeant colour very noticeably indeed. This time was different, however; he had not speculated about anyone's sexual organs or suggested certain anatomical impossibilities. He had not blasphemed the deity.

He had said a name.

Thomas Atkins continued to massage his aching leg, his mind already calling up the image of the young Jamie Carr. Tall and schoolboy-awkward even in his early twenties, Jamie had always had a cheerful word and a toothy smile for anyone who passed his way. He hadn't smiled at the end, though. Nobody had.

"Who's this Jamie, then?" asked a stranger who had served with the Artists' Rifles. His own smile faltered as he looked around at the suddenly somber faces at the table.

Atkins signaled for another pint and leaned forward. His voice was low, but level.

"Was you ever on a court martial that took it all the way?"

The stranger blanched, and shook his head.

"But you'll have heard of it, I've no doubt."

A nod. Everyone had. This had been rather the point.

"Bloody disgrace if you ask me," growled a plump man in a bowler hat who was sitting on the outskirts of the group. "Waste of a good man, and just a Hunnish thing to do full stop. What was the point of it all? Where was the justice?" He looked around, ready to share in the nods.

None came.

"And who," said Atkins quietly, "did you serve with?"

The man stammered something about bone spurs in his feet, damnable luck, had to sit the whole thing out. The men of the East ______ers found reasons to look away.

Atkins managed a rueful smile.

"Well, I won't say it always were the best choice -- but I wasn't there at all those trials, then, was I? I don't know what they all did. But I will say that I knew, personally, two men who **did** get taken out at dawn with the blindfold and cigarette, and I ask you to tell me about your sympathy and justice when you hear about 'em."

He received his new pint gratefully and began:

"The first was another East ______ cove, the Jamie you asked about. They did for him in '17 after he raped a French girl and tried to kill an MP when they came for him. The big, galloping fool; none of us could believe it, right? They bound him up like a hen and dragged him back to brigade, and I saw it all, you see, because I was in a detachment sent with the lieutenant to sort it all out. He kept blubbing like a baby, Jamie did, just saying 'I never meant it, I never meant it o god I never' over and over, like, until one of the guards belted him and he stopped.  

"Now the lieutenant, he says 'Jesus, Jamie, what DID you mean then?' and he couldn't answer that. I never saw the trial but I hear from the lieutenant that it was the same throughout, 'I didn't mean it, she wanted it, it wasn't my fault, o o o,' on and on and on. And then they read out the sentence and I won't repeat the things he said then. No man should have that remembered of him. Didn't take a blindfold, spat out the cigarette, screamed and screamed and screamed. The lads they chose for the squad said they were more embarrassed about it than else."

Atkins paused, a strain clear in his face.

"There isn't a man left of the East ______ers who don't remember *that*, and I wager most of their mates know all about it too. A story like that has legs, if you catch my meaning."

The man in the bowler hat looked thoughtful.

"The other one... well, now, I only met the man once. He was one of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, I think it was, and I spent an evening with him and some of his mates in an estaminet once, and I will tell you now entirely that I have never been less surprised to hear a man had been shot in my life. All bloody evening it was revolution this and boojwah that, and he threatened, all playful like, to poison his company commander who was an excellent wallah from what everyone else had to say.

"Well anyhow he deserted one night, right, sort of melted off into the gloom. The red-hats caught him two miles behind the lines with a bottle of champers and a pistol that wasn't his, but they let him off with Field Punishment 1, which for those of you as don't know"--he looked pointedly at the man in the bowler--"means he got himself taken back to the rear and had to spend an hour or two each day tied to the wheel of a gun, just sitting there like a dog. Never firing or anything, mind, just the humiliation of it. When he got back to his line he was deadly quiet about it all and was gone again two nights later. This time they had to charge him, right? They had no choice.

"So my cousin Bill, who was the clerk for 'em the whole time, he tells me that this trial was one of the worst he'd ever been involved in. This bloke was a trench lawyer like you would not believe, he says, citing rule this and regulation that and all the time appealing to 'the rights of man' like this was f---ing France. And of course it was, but *we* weren't, right? And then it all ended in uproar when he got sentenced; one captain threatened to resign his commission on the spot, others almost came to blows, lots of bad feeling all around. The president of the court had to be transferred out after, and I am told that some held it as a blot on his copybook even when the war ended."

Atkins steeled himself for what was to come. The bowler-wearing man seemed unable to blink.

"And on the morning of it they led him out to the post, him all saintly and quiet like. He refused the blindfold, told them he didn't smoke, and just stood there to take it like he was an ancient martyr and they were a pack of lions. They say he had a smile on even when they fired. And then the company chaplain, he wrote that little notice for one of the London papers about how we can find a Christian example even in the midst of depravity, and then the *Times* picked it up, and the *Mail* denounced it as treason, and you remember how the rest of it all went. Absolute shambles.  

"All that from one grumbling fool who would not simply attend to his duties and watch his mouth."

Atkins drained the last of the pint, visibly weary of the evening. The man in the bowler *did* remember that case, as it happened, and had expressed many strong opinions in support of the "trench lawyer" to his colleagues at the office. Phrases like "a modern saint" and "a true hero" had once escaped his lips, and were ready to do so again -- but discretion, he felt, was the better part of valour.

Atkins concluded with venom:

"So what of this sympathy and justice, I ask you? These two were monsters in their own ways, and I won't say everyone who ever put on a blindfold were, but these two were and I say we're well rid of 'em. And they were put down clean, right? They got to make their peace, and then a quick round, and then off they went. My brother Charlie's pal Sandy, he got done in after his sergeant shoved him out of the way while rushing down the trench, and Sandy's head was a bit too high and a sniper laid him out flat." 

Atkins stood up, with some difficulty; Powys-Jones reached out to steady him, but the hand was swatted away. The rest of the pub grew quiet as Atkins' voice rose.

"My mate Tom Sheffield lay in No Man's Land for two f---ing days with his leg shot off, screaming at us for help, screaming at anyone to help, and he only stopped after a bullet put him out of his misery -- and I won't say it were a German one, either. What tears do you want from me over the men with the blindfold when all that was happening, day in and day out, to thousands and thousands of brave, decent men who didn't do nothing wrong that no one else did?"

He raised his hand as if to strike the man in the bowler, who flinched away. He paused. He deflated.

Atkins dug in his pocket and deposited a few coppers on the table.

"Yeah, mate, it's harsh. It's war. I need to see my wife."

He turned and left the pub, and the darkness of the evening received him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can confirm at least one case in which this worked, and another in which it didn't -- though that one was a somewhat different situation.

The English author C.E. Montague (1867-1928), 47 years old as the war began, found himself bound by conscience to contribute to the war effort in whatever way he could. He had spent the war's early days writing articles and essays encouraging others to enlist, but he became convinced that he needed to participate in a more active way -- he did not want to urge others on to taking risks that he himself would not face.

Initially rejected due to his age, Montague dyed his greying hair and pretended to be over a decade younger to seek a position with the Sportsman's Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers. It was this action that caused a contemporary to declare that, while many men's hair had turned white from fear, Montague was the only man he had ever known whose hair had turned black from courage.

He arrived in France by November of 1915, but his true age was swiftly discovered and he was sent before a medical review board that kept him sidelined for several months. While he was allowed to return to active service early in 1916, this lasted for only a very short time before he was dismissed again for his age.

He remained within the service, however, receiving a series of promotions that saw him elevated to the rank of an official censor and then a member of the military intelligence corps. He eventually became a favoured tour-guide for important visitors to the front -- H.G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, and even the Prime Minister David Lloyd George. He had become somewhat disillusioned with the war effort on the whole, and seemed to delight in getting these celebrities a bit closer to the action than they had intended.

After the war's conclusion he set about writing a book that would upend the conflict's literary landscape in Britain -- [*Disenchantment* (1922)](https://archive.org/details/disenchantment00mont), which set the tone for many of the aggrieved and critical memoirs that would follow during the "war books boom" of 1927-1933 that saw the publication of major works by the likes of Hemingway, Sassoon, Graves, Remarque, Brittain and others.

Another example might be found in the form of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930), who was considerably older during his numerous attempts to join the British Army. He also made no effort to hide his age, however, and -- as an international celebrity -- could not very easily have done so. In his defense, he declared:

 "I think I may say that my name is well known to the younger men of this country and that if I were to take a commission at my age it would set an example which might be of help... I am fifty-five but I am very strong and hardy, and can make my voice audible at great distances, which is useful at drill."

As you know that Sir Arthur wasn't killed in action, you might easily anticipate the result.

He was rejected time and again, in spite of his enthusiasm, and he eventually settled for creating a private home defense battalion to protect against the possibility of German invasion. This in turn became a sort of nightmare for the War Office, who considered Doyle to be an extreme nuisance and his battalion a joke, but as the war dragged on they began to see the potential wisdom of the idea. They decided to formalize the creation of a home defense corps, and they offered him command of the Crowborough Company of the Sixth Royal Sussex Volunteer Regiment. Doyle, wishing to set a good example, demanded that he instead be signed on as a private.

I had hoped to say more about Ford Madox Hueffer (later Ford Madox Ford; 1873-1939), who abandoned his life as an author and propagandist to enlist; he was 41 when he arrived on the Western Front in 1915. I don't currently have access to any details about whether or not this was difficult for him, however, and can say only that he performed his duties admirably and went on to produce some of the most excellent books about the war to emerge in the succeeding decade -- the *Parade's End* tetralogy.

Your question rightly highlights that this is a remarkably understudied aspect of voluntarism during the war, especially when compared to the huge amount of work that has been done on those who were underage. I wish I had more to tell you beyond the above anecdotes, and I'll be sure to return to add more details as I uncover them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The landscape of the 1890-1930 literary period had a very different look at the time than it does in retrospect.

After the death of Tennyson, the office of the Poet Laureate in the United Kingdom was occupied by a series of authors who, while hugely significant in their own time, command virtually no attention now. The office was occupied by only three men during the period running from 1896 to 1967, and the collapse of their respective reputations grows more and more severe with each succeeding appointment. 

Alfred Austin, who served from 1896 to 1913, is not totally forgotten; so too is Robert Bridges, for the most part, who served from 1913 to 1930 and who is now mostly remembered for [*Testament of Beauty*](http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/testament-beauty) (1929) -- which is not exactly saying much to begin with. Indeed, he seems now most often to come up in connection with his work in preserving and bringing to print the poetry of the 19th C. Jesuit Gerald Manley Hopkins, who might also be a good candidate for this list. John Masefield is the one who vexes me the most, however; he was held the Laureateship from 1930 through 1967, which is an absurdly long time, and is now entirely forgotten in a popular sense in spite of being one of the most prolific and respected poets, dramatists and novelists of his time. His work has a very old-fashioned feel to it, when looked at from today's perspective, and his consistent focus on seafaring content has not served him well in leaving a diverse legacy. I think he's great, myself, but I am prepared to think so alone.

We might also consider the case of Sir Henry Newbolt, who was titanically influential in the poetry world during the early twentieth century -- especially when it came to giving support to new poets who would soon find their feet. In spite of being quite prolific and very well-liked at the height of his career, his name lingers on today pretty much solely as the author of [Vita Lampada](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/vita-lampada/) -- and this memory is not exactly a salutary one for many.

This period's poetry provides many cases of this sort, for good or ill; the post-Victorian milieu saw competing factions in the British literary scene attempt to chart a course for what a new and modern poetry might look like, and the intervening decades have not been kind to those who failed. The most promising faction in the pre-WWI context was probably the Georgians, collected under the editorial power of Edward Marsh's [*Georgian Poetry*](https://archive.org/details/georgianpoetry1200marsrich) anthology series between 1911 and 1922. Coincidentally (seriously; I am no great fan of the Georgians), this is the same ten-year stretch of literature to which I would happily confine myself forever if I had to choose from all other writing that exists --  but that's another story.

The Georgians attempted to develop a new poetical voice that respected some of the formal conventions of Victorian work while probing more deeply into the complexities of emotion, thought, and affect. Whether they succeeded or not is another matter, but we may find among their number many perfectly respectable and even excellent poets whose reputations endure to this day. These anthologies included names you've almost certainly heard -- D.H. Lawrence, Rupert Brooke, Isaac Rosenberg, Siegfried Sassoon (n.b. the fact that the latter three are now known far more prominently as war writers than as Georgians is not a coincidence). They also included names that mean little to the modern reader at all -- W.H. Davies, Gordon Bottomley, Thomas Moult, etc. 

They also included J.C. Squire, who would eventually take over editorial duties on the series, as he would of so much else at that time. Squire had been the editor of the *New Statesman* during the latter half of WWI, and had also served as the literary editor for *Land   Water* from 1914 onward. After the war he took up editorial duties at the *London Mercury*, a very influential literary magazine, and it was during this time that his clashes with the avant-garde crowd began to intensify. He was the focal point of the "Squirearchy," a the term disparagingly applied to Squire and his colleagues by members of the Bloomsbury Group (e.g. Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, etc.), who were as close to formal enemies as either group had. 

Squire, through his periodicals, his literary essays, his own poetry and his conversation, made very clear [the contempt](http://themodernistreview.co.uk/the-london-mercury-and-the-scourge-of-the-blagueurs/) in which he held the new, experimental arts. He thought futurism was the stupidest thing going; he thought Pound, Lewis et al.'s *Blast!* one of the most ludicrous things ever published, and lamented its collapse only insofar as it meant that more such magazines might spring up to take its place; he hated what he viewed as the chaotic, japing formlessness of so much of Modernism, and he bridled at the seeming focus on the lurid, the depraved, the downcast and the disgusting in their works. Many of his associates with similarly conservative styles felt this way, too; you can find all sorts of essays by G.K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc (for example) denouncing the excesses and barbarities of the Modernists. While Chesterton is experiencing something of a revival lately, the rest of those involved in this -- much like Squire himself -- have seen their stars more or less go out.

Anyway, the assumption of the triumph of Modernism has generated a popular conviction that James Joyce's *Ulysses* and Virginia Woolf's *Orlando* and so on were the leading books of their age, but they absolutely were not. While they are undoubtedly brilliant and very much worth reading now, their consumption at the time was dwarfed by that of far more conventional novels by the likes of Booth Tarkington, Eden Philpotts, F.R. Benson, G.A. Henty, Hall Caine, Mazo de la Roche, John Buchan and so on. It's a real shame, too! Buchan's Richard Hannay thrillers hold up very well even after a century, and F.R. Benson's *Lucia* novels are essential reading for anyone who enjoys Evelyn Waugh or P.G. Wodehouse.

De la Roche is especially interesting to me; her [*Jalna* series](https://www.loc.gov/nls/bibliographies/minibibs/jalna.html) spanned sixteen volumes and was for a time collectively the best-selling literary production in the English-speaking world. In spite of having run to almost two hundred editions in English alone, if you can even find a copy of one of those books now in a brick and mortar store, you're a luckier man than I am -- and if you can hear about them in an English class between the hours spent on "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" and *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, it will be something of a miracle. It's a sad story. I visited de la Roche's grave to apologize, once, for all the good it did.

**TL;DR:** The years have not been kind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually not sure of his own beliefs, but many of Guy Gavriel Kay's books have considerable complex treatments of religion and belief. 

The one most widely explored is that of the Jaddites, fantasy-world analogues of medieval Christians (mostly), who profess a faith in a god who seems to be sort of an Apollonian take on the Christian Father and Son: Jad is a sun-god who journeys beneath the world each night to do battle with evil things in defense of his people, and returns in the morning to bring back the light. Some branches of the faith also include his son, Heladikos, who plummeted to death on Earth -- but in a noble way that sadly escapes me at the moment. This is all covered in detail in *Sailing to Sarantium* and its sequel, but it's been a while since I read it and some of the details are not so fresh.

He has a rough analogue of medieval Muslims in the form of the Asharites, and of medieval Jews in the form of the Kindath -- though their actual beliefs are only loosely based on anything one might expect from their real-world counterparts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are three that might interest you! All are in the 100-page range.

1. Adolfo Bioy Casares - *The Invention of Morel* (1940): My flair might already suggest I'm in the bag for this, and that would be true. This fantastic Argentine novella offered inspiration for things like *Lost*, *The Prisoner*, and *Myst*. It's incredible.

2. Alan Bennett - *The Uncommon Reader* (2007): In which Queen Elizabeth II becomes a voracious reader of transgressive literature and makes many important changes to her life and to that of the nation she commands.

3. Rebecca West - *The Return of the Soldier* (1918): One of the great early tragedies in the canon of First World War fiction, and also one of the best. An injured officer returning from the front has lost the last fifteen years of his memory, and the consequences are miserable indeed.

You might also enjoy James Welch's *Winter in the Blood*, Alejo Carpentier's *The Kingdom of this World*, Sjn's *The Whispering Muse*, or Jean Rhys' *The Wide Sargasso Sea*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My work tends to focus more on the latter end of the nineteenth century and the transitional period into the twentieth, but I can provide a considerable number of examples that may fit the bill for you.

A good early example of this phenomenon happening in another direction would be the English poet Felicia Hemans. Up until her sudden death in 1835, she was probably the most popular woman poet in the English-speaking world, and was eulogized poetically in death by William Wordsworth, among others. Volumes like [*England and Spain*](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=bwrp;idno=HemaFEngla), [*Tales and Historic Scenes*](https://archive.org/details/talesandhistori00hemagoog) and [*Scenes and Hymns of Life*](https://archive.org/details/scenesandhymnsl00hemagoog) sold incredibly well even long after her demise, and her poetry was widely anthologized and recited. Her reputation collapsed as the nineteenth century concluded, however, as her crisp, orderly meter and total unobjectionability did not maintain their luster during a period of greater and more daring experimentation. You would be lucky now to find anyone who has even heard of her, much less knew any of her work.

After the death of Tennyson, the office of the Poet Laureate in the United Kingdom was occupied by a series of authors who, while hugely significant in their own time, command virtually no attention now. The office was occupied by only three men during the period running from 1896 to 1967, and the collapse of their respective reputations grows more and more severe with each succeeding appointment. 

Alfred Austin, who served from 1896 to 1913, is not totally forgotten; so too is Robert Bridges, for the most part, who served from 1913 to 1930 and who is now mostly remembered for [*Testament of Beauty*](http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/testament-beauty) (1929) -- which is not exactly saying much to begin with. Indeed, he seems now most often to come up in connection with his work in preserving and bringing to print the poetry of the 19th C. Jesuit Gerald Manley Hopkins, who might also be a good candidate for this list. John Masefield is the one who vexes me the most, however; he was held the Laureateship from 1930 through 1967, which is an absurdly long time, and is now entirely forgotten in a popular sense in spite of being one of the most prolific and respected poets, dramatists and novelists of his time. His work has a very old-fashioned feel to it, when looked at from today's perspective, and his consistent focus on seafaring content has not served him well in leaving a diverse legacy. I think he's great, myself, but I am prepared to think so alone.

We might also consider the case of Sir Henry Newbolt, who was titanically influential in the poetry world during the early twentieth century -- especially when it came to giving support to new poets who would soon find their feet. In spite of being quite prolific and very well-liked at the height of his career, his name lingers on today pretty much solely as the author of [Vita Lampada](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/vita-lampada/) -- and this memory is not exactly a salutary one for many.

This period's poetry provides many cases of this sort, for good or ill; the post-Victorian milieu saw competing factions in the British literary scene attempt to chart a course for what a new and modern poetry might look like, and the intervening decades have not been kind to those who failed. The most promising faction in the pre-WWI context was probably the Georgians, collected under the editorial power of Edward Marsh's [*Georgian Poetry*](https://archive.org/details/georgianpoetry1200marsrich) anthology series between 1911 and 1922. Coincidentally (seriously; I am no great fan of the Georgians), this is the same ten-year stretch of literature to which I would happily confine myself forever if I had to choose from all other writing that exists --  but that's another story.

The Georgians attempted to develop a new poetical voice that respected some of the formal conventions of Victorian work while probing more deeply into the complexities of emotion, thought, and affect. Whether they succeeded or not is another matter, but we may find among their number many perfectly respectable and even excellent poets whose reputations endure to this day. These anthologies included names you've almost certainly heard -- D.H. Lawrence, Rupert Brooke, Isaac Rosenberg, Siegfried Sassoon (n.b. the fact that the latter three are now known far more prominently as war writers than as Georgians is not a coincidence). They also included names that mean little to the modern reader at all -- W.H. Davies, Gordon Bottomley, Thomas Moult, etc. 

They also included J.C. Squire, who would eventually take over editorial duties on the series, as he would of so much else at that time. Squire had been the editor of the *New Statesman* during the latter half of WWI, and had also served as the literary editor for *Land   Water* from 1914 onward. After the war he took up editorial duties at the *London Mercury*, a very influential literary magazine, and it was during this time that his clashes with the avant-garde crowd began to intensify. He was the focal point of the "Squirearchy," a the term disparagingly applied to Squire and his colleagues by members of the Bloomsbury Group (e.g. Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, etc.), who were as close to formal enemies as either group had. 

Squire, through his periodicals, his literary essays, his own poetry and his conversation, made very clear [the contempt](http://themodernistreview.co.uk/the-london-mercury-and-the-scourge-of-the-blagueurs/) in which he held the new, experimental arts. He thought futurism was the stupidest thing going; he thought Pound, Lewis et al.'s *Blast!* one of the most ludicrous things ever published, and lamented its collapse only insofar as it meant that more such magazines might spring up to take its place; he hated what he viewed as the chaotic, japing formlessness of so much of Modernism, and he bridled at the seeming focus on the lurid, the depraved, the downcast and the disgusting in their works. Many of his associates with similarly conservative styles felt this way, too; you can find all sorts of essays by G.K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc (for example) denouncing the excesses and barbarities of the Modernists. While Chesterton is experiencing something of a revival lately, the rest of those involved in this -- much like Squire himself -- have seen their stars more or less go out.

Anyway, all of this has been sort of a tidal wave of obscuration and collapse, and I'm sorry for that. I find myself far more interested in how once-popular authors fall by the wayside than I am in how once-obscure authors suddenly begin to command attention. It's also only just the beginning; the assumption of the triumph of Modernism has generated a popular conviction that James Joyce's *Ulysses* and Virginia Woolf's *Orlando* and so on were the leading books of their age, but they absolutely were not. While they are undoubtedly brilliant and very much worth reading now, their consumption at the time was dwarfed by that of far more conventional novels by the likes of Booth Tarkington, Eden Philpotts, F.R. Benson, G.A. Henty, Hall Caine, Mazo de la Roche, John Buchan and so on. It's a real shame, too! Buchan's Richard Hannay thrillers hold up very well even after a century, and F.R. Benson's *Lucia* novels are essential reading for anyone who enjoys Evelyn Waugh or P.G. Wodehouse.

De la Roche is especially interesting to me; her [*Jalna* series](https://www.loc.gov/nls/bibliographies/minibibs/jalna.html) spanned sixteen volumes and was for a time collectively the best-selling literary production in the English-speaking world. In spite of having run to almost two hundred editions in English alone, if you can even find a copy of one of those books now in a brick and mortar store, you're a luckier man than I am -- and if you can hear about them in an English class between the hours spent on "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" and *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, it will be something of a miracle. It's a sad story. I visited de la Roche's grave to apologize, once, for all the good it did.

**TL;DR:** The years have not been kind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wilhelm also had something of a problem when it came to recklessly saying things that would come back to haunt him later. 

His open comparison of German troops to the Huns of old in his Bremerhaven speech in July of 1900 would serve as the backdrop to an international propaganda campaign against Germany in the decade to come, for example:

 "Should you encounter the enemy, he will be defeated! No quarter will be given! Prisoners will not be taken! Whoever falls into your hands is forfeited. Just as a thousand years ago the Huns under their King Attila made a name for themselves, one that even today makes them seem mighty in history and legend, may the name German be affirmed by you in such a way in China that no Chinese will ever again dare to look cross-eyed at a German."

And then there's the infamous ["Daily Telegraph Affair"](https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Daily_Telegraph_Affair) in October of 1908, which saw the Kaiser sit down with an English reporter for a candid interview about world politics. And... well, you be the judge:

 "You English," he said, "are mad, mad, mad as March hares. What has come over you that you are so completely given over to suspicions quite unworthy of a great nation? What more can I do than I have done? I declared with all the emphasis at my command, in my speech at Guildhall, that my heart is set upon peace, and that it is one of my dearest wishes to live on the best of terms with England. Have I ever been false to my word? Falsehood and prevarication are alien to my nature. My actions ought to speak for themselves, but you listen not to them but to those who misinterpret and distort them. That is a personal insult which I feel and resent. To be forever misjudged, to have my repeated offers of friendship weighed and scrutinized with jealous, mistrustful eyes, taxes my patience severely. I have said time after time that I am a friend of England, and your press --, at least, a considerable section of it -- bids the people of England refuse my proffered hand and insinuates that the other holds a dagger. How can I convince a nation against its will?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If he sticks to Two-Moon-World, I wouldn't at all mind if he provided a follow-up to **The Last Light of the Sun**. That's my favourite of his books so far, and it hits exactly the right point in the development of Jaddism for me. Maybe a story about an Erling joining an equivalent of the Varangian Guard and giving us another look at Sarantium while we're at it.

In terms of new ground, something like ancient Egypt or Babylon might be very interesting -- and I will readily add my voice to those suggesting South America.

Other possibilities:

- Mali or Songhai
- The arrival of Genghis Khan in Europe or the arrival of someone like Marco Polo or Matteo Ricci in the far east
- The first Magellan-like circumnavigation of the globe! Assuming his world IS a globe...

	<TEXT> You might enjoy the works of Guy Gavriel Kay. Most of his books have real human history as their pretext and then take what he calls "a quarter turn towards the fantastic."

The best place to start would probably be the *Sarantine Mosaic* duology -- *Sailing to Sarantium* and *Lord of Emperors*. These two novels are set in a fantasy-world equivalent of Byzantium under the Emperor Justinian, and they are a wonderful aggregation of adventure, romance, intrigue, and magic. You might also enjoy the standalone novels *Tigana* and *The Lions of Al-Rassan*; the latter takes place in the same world as the first two I recommended, but has no real necessary connection to them, while the former can be read on its own without any trouble. Both are about the perils of nationalism and religious supremacy, but from remarkably different perspectives: *Tigana* is about the immortal necessity of a strong national identity in the face of tyrannical and imperial oppression, while *Lions* is about the futility of casting distinctions between national and religious perspectives when pursuing a broader humanist project. Both are beautifully sad, anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply!

 How is Jean Valjean 'a liar and a thief and a fraud and an impostor'?

Well, he's a liar because he... lies all the time. About his past, about his identity, about where he got his wealth and authority. I know that he was willing to confront the court and implicate himself to save an innocent man, which we as readers must again recognize as admirable, but this isn't something that figures in Cosette's decision to trust him. Besides, he flees rather than face any consequences for what he did.

He is literally a thief twice over -- in the stealing of the bread originally (which I will absolutely agree was justifiable under the circumstances, but still theft) and in the stealing of the Bishop's silver subsequently. That he was forgiven for the latter and given a dose of wholly unexpected and unearned mercy does not negate what he actually did -- remember the Bishop's astounding and dark declaration that he owns Valjean's very soul, now, and that he respects a return on that. That's very far from the simplistic moral calculus of which the book has been accused in this thread.

He is a fraud because he ascends to increasingly authoritative positions without the necessary qualifications or background. I do not dispute at all that he does a good job in these positions, apart from not taking the Fantine situation seriously enough when he could have prevented it entirely, but he has no right to the titles and authority he commands. Let's also not forget that he seems to have had no objection to employing a venal, raping monster as a factory manager. Must we really believe that he just didn't know? At best he didn't BOTHER to know.

He's an impostor because he pretends all the time to be people he isn't. He adopts a half dozen identities throughout the novel; while I am very happy to concede that he does so with good intentions and mostly good results, in at least one case he might have destroyed an innocent man's life if he (Valjean) had not been willing to submit himself to the judgement of a court. His deceptions have consequences, in short -- and his susceptibility to blackmail in relation to that threatens to ruin his and Cosette's lives on more than one occasion.

 they're complexities that are easier to see as a modern reader, but they don't seem intended by Hugo

I have to wonder about this, though. So much of his major fiction is morally complex and challenging, and I find it hard to believe that he just had all of this occur by accident. *Notre Dame* was no accident; *Ninety-Three* was no accident; *The Man Who Laughs* was no accident. *Les Miserables* presents us with heroes in the form of thieves, radicals, street urchins and prostitutes -- the "respectable" characters are barely even given a fighting chance. Even at that, the actual villains are, respectively, a ferocious self-tortured moralist and an impoverished family -- and we see enough of both parties to feel the quiet desperation that lies behind all they both do.

 Now if only I could find someone to do this for me with Jane Austen.

Well, you've got me there. I've enjoyed every Austen book I've read, but none of them have seared themselves into my memory in even remotely the same way that *Les Miserables* has! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  then rescued suddenly by a hero

Kind of? Her hero is a liar and a thief and a fraud and an impostor. He has good intentions, and we as readers know that he seems to have taken some long-ago lessons about moral value to heart, but from Cosette's perspective he's just some enormous weird stranger who offers slightly better prospects than the home she inhabits, and who claims to have known the mother she has never met.

 an almost princess status

Also, kind of? She spends most of her formative years trapped in a convent, and even when she gets to move out with Valjean into Paris proper it is always on a very tight leash. She has no power or independence or agency, and she also has no involvement in Paris society at all -- she basically knows two actual people apart from Valjean: Marius, with whom she falls in love immediately because he's the only young man she's ever met, and Eponine, who is actually the daughter of the people who tormented her so many years ago. None of this seems especially princess-like apart from her having very little control over her own destiny; Valjean would not even accrue any benefits by marrying her off to someone, let alone allowing her to become involved with Marius.

I will grant at once that she is perhaps unrealistically beautiful and kind and sensitive, but at least part of this seems to proceed from her having Valjean as a father-figure in the first place, her physical appearance notwithstanding. Hell, maybe we *can* bring her beauty into this: the book is very clear that the difference between a beautiful woman and a broken-down mess of a woman is how they are treated by the people in their lives, not just their genetic dispositions. Fantine wasn't born without front teeth and hair, after all.

Also, I should say that I am not trying to be unreasonably critical of your take on this, here. *Les Miserables* is very dear to me, in all the translations in which I've ever read it, and I feel a perhaps unreasonable desire to defend it where I can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Good ubermensch vs evil villains.

Did we read the same book? Whatever one might think of the goodness of the protagonists, the novel's major "villains" are way more complicated than the black-and-white suggestions being offered in this thread. Javert's obsession is worrying, to be sure, but Hugo spends so much time explaining where he's coming from and why, and the inspector's ironclad morality is at least impartial in its application. He's even willing to throw *himself* under the bus for a minor policy violation against a man he greatly dislikes.

Meanwhile, the Thnardiers are monsters who struggle through the same adversity as our heroes and manage to find an awful modicum of success in the end. They aren't defeated or undone or anything of the sort -- after a frustration of their final scheme, they travel to South America to become slave-drivers and there's no indication that they have any trouble in doing so. Also their daughter betrays them and dies.

Cosette is only "Cinderella" insofar as she is abused by her care-givers. That she might find better opportunities in a radically different environment and under the care of someone who actually wants to help her is not exactly the stuff of fairy tales. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  More generally, I have never been pressured to adopt a particular textbook or anything from a particular publisher. 

I had an odd experience with this recently, in fact, and it stood out all the more for being so rare. A rep from a company I'd never heard of e-mailed me out of the blue to offer his services in helping design a custom course reader for the coming term. I told him that I had no need of this services, as our school's print shop will do the same thing he was offering at a fraction of the cost, but I wished him the best and said I'd mention him to any colleagues who might be interested.

His response was just absurdly rude. He confidently claimed that a lower price than what he was offering was impossible (not true), that he could handle all of the copyright clearances for me (so could the print shop), and -- astoundingly -- that I was selling my students short by not giving them "a real book." He then demanded(!) to know when my office hours were so that he could come by and talk it over in person. My reply was a cold one, to say the least, but firm.

A week or so later, I got an e-mail from my office mate saying that some guy had come by asking to see me about making a course pack. Nothing further has come of it, thank goodness, but I've never before encountered a publishing rep so determined not to take no for an answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps you might try her on Guy Gavriel Kay's *The Lions of Al-Rassan*? It does seem to be available on audible **[here](http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Lions-of-Al-Rassan-Audiobook/B008ESCXIW/ref=a_search_c4_1_6_srTtl?qid=1488604100 sr=1-6)**. It's one of the best and least typical pieces of fantasy writing out there from an author who has carved out a pretty amazing niche for himself in the form of taking real historical events and retelling them with what he has called a quarter-turn towards the fantastic. This one focuses on the complex religious and political tensions in a fantasy version of Al-Andalus, with a pretty great analogue of El Cid being a major character. It has all the adventure and intrigue and fun and world-building that you might expect of a good fantasy novel, but also manages to be morally and emotionally devastating.

Anyway, just a thought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guy Gavriel Kay's *The Last Light of the Sun* focuses heavily on this kind of thing, and functions as a sort of fantasy retelling of certain elements of the life of King Alfred the Great. Kay has other books set in the same universe, but you don't need to have read any of them first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, but the ending IS happy. They can wistfully imagine what might have been, but they've each achieved their dreams and get the closure they need to acknowledge that. I get that it can be hard to spend a whole movie rooting for a couple to be together, only for them to go their separate ways, but them *being together* was never the point: it was rather that they were both deeply miserable and broken people who managed to save each other in the end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This may be slightly beyond the bounds of your request, but S.M. Stirling's Nantucket trilogy (*Island in the Sea of Time*, *Against the Tide of Years* and *Oceans of Eternity*) have a considerable amount of Babylonian (and related) content from c. 1250BC. Time-stranded 20th-century Americans end up becoming involved in the court of Shagarakti-Shuriash and his eventual successor, though I'll admit that this doesn't happen meaningfully until the second book.

You may also enjoy Ted Chiang's short story "Tower of Babylon," in which a team of miners are hired to make the months-long journey to the top of the famous tower to begin digging upwards into the vault of heaven. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Germanic warriors in *Gladiator* do much the same one too, again as direct homage. I would still agree that *Zulu* does it better, but as young guy watching *Gladiator* for the first time there was something appalling about hearing this unearthly, monstrous sound coming out of the trees and fog. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was a real surprise to me too! But it does work surprisingly well. I will say that not all of his works are like this, but many of them are and they have the weird distinction of taking place in the same world without actually be chronologically connected in any way. It would be like if GRRM wrote ten novels set in Westeros that had only the most vague connections to one another, but I love it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're very welcome! I was also remiss in not recommending his *The Lions of Al-Rassan*, which is probably the most purely "romantic" of his works. It's also based vaguely upon the lives and adventures of El Cid and Rebecca of York, to give you some idea of the direction in which it goes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may find what you're after in the books of Guy Gavriel Kay. His many fantasy works focus on human relationships, primarily, rather than upon magic and battles and the many other things that mark so much writing of this kind. *Sailing to Sarantium* or *Under Heaven* would be good places to start, depending upon whether you're more likely to be interested in 6th-century Byzantium or 8th-century China -- most of his novels take actual human history and rework it into a fantastical context. </TEXT>
