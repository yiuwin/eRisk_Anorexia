	<TEXT> Initially, it was because I was amazed by how something that can fit in my hand was worth almost as much as a condo! I started researching gem stones, reading up on their history, their rarity, their extraction, etc. 

It's actually extremely complicated. A one grade level difference in quality (clarity, color, cut) can mean a six figure difference in price. Furthermore, the geological processes that form gemstones and gave them their color is absolutely mind-blowing. 

I just became absolutely fascinated with them. My collection has been growing and every month I pick up a few pieces. I'll probably never be able to get out of them what I pay, but it's worth it to me. Haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are quite a few lovestories they left hanging. Mrs. Patmore and Mr. Mason, Alfred and Daisy, Andy and Daisy, etc. 

I wouldn't mind a bit about the hospital but the family and servants are far too interesting to me. I would love for Larry and Ameila to get their just deserts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Downtown Abbey. I thought it would be a soapy, melodramatic guilty pleasure. It is, but it's also a remarkably well-acted, excellently produced period drama that explores the changing world in the early 1900s and dives into themes of family, wealth, and class. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tom and Edmonds get married. Edmonds is an independent, free thinking, liberal woman who is well-mannered. Tom, well you all know how awesome Tom is. I think they'd make a great couple. 

Branson and Talbot Motors take off. One of the main themes of the show was the idea of business taking over. Playing roles previously played by aristocrats. 

With their company thriving, the Crawleys, Talbots, and Bransons can continue to sustain Downtown and grow. 

Barrow as the butler. As the great Avatar Aang once said, "When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change." Thomas was at the brink of suicide. He had truly gone through hell. I'd also love for him to find love. 

Given the period, it obviously wouldn't be possible for him to make the relationship public, but Thomas deserves some happiness after redeeming himself. 

Just my two cents. What would you like to see? 

Love from Pennsylvania!  </TEXT>
