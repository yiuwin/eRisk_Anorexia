	<TEXT> Just discovered it the day before yesterday, and already a hundred pages in: Susan Wise Bauer's The History of the Ancient World, followed by the Medieval and then the Renaissance Worlds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I weigh it up on a small cardboard platform, open up, drop it - the powder, not the cardboard - onto the back of my tongue and take a drink. Not really any flavor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1g. Kind of sedating and soothing. Baicalin is better at doses of around 6g. Probably just need to try more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The baicalein is good. Kinda iffy about even bothering with the matrine though, considering the total lack of information. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. I like DPT, 4-HO-MiPT, MPT, and a handful of others too much to stick with the typical, albeit illegal, ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quite recently a vendor began to offer matrine for sale. Rather pricey, I think, but I haven't the  faintest idea what the point is, so maybe it isn't that bad. Apparently it  comes from Sophora flavescens. Anybody have any clue whatsoever about this apparent agonist of mu- and kappa-opioid receptors? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Short it is not, but I would recommend Will Durant's The Story of Civilization. Vol. 1 deals with Asia and prehistory, while 2-11 deal with European history up to 1815. Been reading it for the better part of a year: almost done volume 9.

John Darwin's After Tamerlane is perhaps closer to what you are looking for, but in general I really didn't care for that book.

Perhaps Jacques Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence. The problem is mostly that you aren't really going to find many books that cover periods of over several centuries. 

Arnold Toynbee's A Study of History is 12 volumes, so far too long for you.

My last thought is perhaps the best? The Rise of the West by William Hardy McNeill (you may have heard of Spengler's The Decline of the West [Der Untergang des Abendlandes]). About a thousand pages and covers the entire period of Western history.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Decent at the right dose, but very mild below that. 40mg+ is recommended. </TEXT>
