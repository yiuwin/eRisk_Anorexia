	<TEXT> There is no outside help.  Both countries declare war jointly and try to invade each other.  Who controls the most of their opponents land after 1 month, 1 year, and in 5 years what will the result be of the war? 

Each nation only gets the natural resources they already posses in their boundaries.  Each nation only gets to use weapons made by industry in their own nation, so no outside help However The Netherlands and Germany could completely siphon off all gasoline (and other resources) for military use, that's being used by civilians.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So when starkiller base is used and it destroys those planets, why are they all so near each other in space?  They are clearly very close to one another.  Surely the first order didn't destroy a bunch of planets all in the same system? 

Also why are all the planets destroyed able to be seen from space at least a few light years away, when they are on Maz's planet?  It's impossible to see a planet in another solar system with the naked eye, and even if they did happen to be in the same solar system there wouldn't be huge visible explosions like that  </TEXT>
