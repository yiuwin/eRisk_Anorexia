	<TEXT> It cant be nicotine overdose at 1mg, I'm not chain vaping, I've switched to a fresh batch of nic from a different vendor. What else could it be? PG? I always use a 70vg/30pg mix can you get these symptoms from PG? Ive never had a problem with PG in 5 years of vaping. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I'm using much cleaner nic now and still experiencing the same shit. Still only vaping at 1mg. Not sure what it could be, its quite discouraging because I enjoy vaping and its turned into a nice little hobby, diy-ing etc. Dont really want to give it up completely just yet, but I am baffled as to what could be making me feel like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Time should lessen nicotine content not strengthen it

Thats what I thought. The nic is definitely the problem. It took me a long time of being sick to figure that out, but you're right, looks like I need a new batch. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Regularly have to drop Nic level. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-01 03:31:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience. Over the last few months I've had to drop my nic level alot. from 6mg down to currently 0.5mg. Not because I wanted to but because I couldn't handle it.

I will get headaches, slight nausea, dizziness and just a general unwell feeling. So I drop my nic level down and I feel ok for a week, then I start feeling shite again, drop the nic, feel good, rinse repeat.
I find it strange that I cant handle a certain level for an extended period of time. Could it be the quality of my nicotine? It is kinda old and amber coloured. I havent noticed a difference in taste or smell though.
Any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been diying for about 3 years and buy my concentrates from Juice Factory. Even Vapoureyes has a good range.
I buy my pg and vg from basedrop.
1 litre for $12, cant beat it.
Oh and just to make things much easier for yourself, dont measure in volume, measure in weight, no need to mess around with syringes. Buy a set of scales and you're set. It's soo much more efficient. </TEXT>
