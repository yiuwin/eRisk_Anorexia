	<TEXT> Well that would certainly give a more realistic vibe, however I purposefully chose those colors because I thought it might look more unique. Also I'm not entirely confident with my ability to draw realism XD

Thanks for the advice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I'm hoping to download an image. I figure because the US is around 2600 miles wide and 1500 miles high that the image will be around 2600x1500 pixels. I've found images like that here https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/2ymcit/topographic_hillshade_map_of_the_contiguous/

But there's shading around mountains and hills that means I can't easily get the height data. If you know of any relief maps without shading I could use that! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For a personal project I'm working on I need to get elevation data for the entire US. I'd really like to have just one file containing elevation for every square mile. Is there anywhere I can get this kind of data and use it for free?

Edit: /u/SwampRabbit gave me a link to the kind of image I was looking for here https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-small-scale-dataset-100-meter-resolution-elevation-of-the-conterminous-united-states-2012 </TEXT>
