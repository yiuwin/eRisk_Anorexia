	<TEXT> Think about something as simple as sanitation. Virtually every single person in the industrialized world would have revolutionary knowledge about sanitation. Very basic stuff, like keeping waste separate from food and water. Or how about medicine? Disinfection before medical procedures. Or what about things as simple as cooking? Washing your hands and surfaces to kill disease-causing germs. The daily things and knowledge that a person does now would be almost unthinkable to someone from 400 years ago. The biggest difficulty wouldn't be having revolutionary information, it'd be convincing people that your knowledge is worthwhile. For that you'd need evidence, which means you'd have to work at it, which would stop most people in their tracks. And Earth of the 1600s was much less accepting of evidence and more embracing of dogma than we are today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alcohol gives you a feeling of euphoria. Which means that consuming it gives you an intrinsically enjoyable experience. Recently I learned there is a drug used for treating alcoholism that interferes with its ability to produce euphoria. If you use the drug and consume alcohol you still feel intoxicated (uncoordinated, depressed, etc.) but are unable to feel the euphoria due to the effect of the drug. Apparently it makes the consumption of alcohol a completely unenjoyable experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Games were EXPENSIVE! At least in Canada. But the release of a big title was like the release of a new iPhone today. I remember being in grade 8 and going on a school trip to Quebec City (a junior high ritual in Canada) and spending $96 (all the spending money for the week that my parents gave me) when I saw Dragon Warrior IV in a Toys R Us. It's probabl ynot even worth that much to collectors today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a great aunt, her name was Mabel. When she was in her late 70s she went on a streak of ridiculous raffle winnings - ridiculous not only because of the number of things she won in a short time, but also because they were completely inappropriate for an elderly lady. In less than six months she won downhill skis, a hot dog maker, a mountain bike, and some other things I don't recall (this was about 20 years ago). She didn't even have any kids or grand kids, so I don't know what ever would've happened to all that stuff.

	<TEXT> The Saviors would destroy Woodbury in a completely lopsided battle. Woodbury had at most a dozen experienced fighters, who often only won fights by using embarrassingly transparent tactics (waving the white flag while approaching that military unit, for example). The Saviors are a hardened, organized military force numbering in the hundreds who can draw upon intelligence networks and mercenary forces (as they did by turning the Heapsters against Alexandria). It's not even remotely close. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Woodbury never had a tank. The tank belonged to Mitch, who the governor, going by the name of Brian, met after Woodbury collapsed and most of its residents were either killed by the governor or absorbed into the prison community. 

I think a fight to the death between the governor (who destroyed everyone he faced in hand-to-hand combat) and Negan armed with Lucille (just to give his skinny ass a fighting chance) would be amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this, and simple exhaustion of the body's resources. an organism subject to long term exposure (without adequate caloric intake) will deplete its fat stores in an attempt to maintain favourable internal conditions. as that fat disappears the organism has less insulation which causes less efficient body heat retention, which causes even faster burning of any remaining stores. You can see how it spirals until the animal is eventually exhausted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Eugenics Wars were the shadows

Hmm, that's an interesting and convenient way of looking at it (had to google it since I never heard of it before). But I think it will be harder to deal with WWIII in the same way since there are 600 million deaths associated with that conflict. If Discovery or the film reboot last into the mid 2020's is that going to be in conflict with the events of, for example, Encounter at Farpoint (which I believe is based on the premise of WWIII)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  We can handwave the pre-First Contact back story easily enough without losing too much of what happens later. Yeah, the backstory is important, but aside from a few episodes, it's not foundational until after that.

I agree: there have been many pre-contemporary canon events (ST IV, Carbon Creek, Little Green Men) but they have been mostly clandestine or otherwise specifically shown to not influence the future in significant ways.  But we're approaching (or have experienced) events which cannot be conveniently ignored because they've had cascading effects on the Star Trek universe (and I'd argue the Eugenics Wars are one of these). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> they probably die from hypothermia, a deficit between the body heat that an organism can generate and the rate that heat is lost by the body. any organism can be affected by exposure, but humans are particularly susceptible to it since many of us live in environments for which we are not particularly well suited. i imagine even a polar bear could die from exposure, despite the fact it is incredibly well adapted to its environment, if it cannot consume enough calories to maintain its body temperature. that being said, for animals that are living in their natural environment, death by predation most likely happens before death by exposure, because the weakness that causes a net deficit in energy makes an animal more vulnerable to predation (an exception, of course, being apex predators such as polar bears, that have no predators).

Edit: in a broad sense death by exposure could also include such things as death from heat stroke, dehydration or any lack of basic human needs (adequate food, water, shelter, clothing). this of course would also be less common for animals than for humans. </TEXT>
