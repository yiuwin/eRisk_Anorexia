	<TEXT> I think I bought one that was actually a resell...I didn't get it from Ticketmaster, I did from. I know they were about $120 when I first clicked on them, then they sold out. So then the price went up again. The processing was kinda expense too, I was a bit of an idiot to only look at one site to buy them smh </TEXT>
