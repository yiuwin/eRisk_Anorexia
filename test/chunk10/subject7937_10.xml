	<TITLE> [Request][PC][Steam] Rocket League </TITLE>

	<TEXT> First Request on GOG. :)



About the game : 

Rocket League is a multiplayer online game which include two of my favorite things, that is, SOCCER   CARS. Driving meets soccer. It has a fairly large player base.

Why I want it : 

First off I am a big fan of soccer and cars. A lot of my friends play this game and I would love to play it with them and other players online. It currently is free for the weekend and I am having a blast with it and can't stop playing it.

Why I can't afford it :

Well I am a student and as many students are,I too am broke. I did have some savings but lost them all in repair works of my motorcycle after I met with an accident last week.

Conclusion :

This is my first ever request on GOG and I hope I am doing it right. Thank you for reading through my request.

Bonus : The game is currently at 30 % off on the Steam Market.

Now there is a lot of screaming in this song. But if we shift our focus a bit, the bagpipe and flute elements are absolutely beautiful. The flute solo never ceases to amaze me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not me, but a friend. Never showed up in class and failed in most of the subjects. All he did was played DotA 2 all day. He always wanted to be a professional ESports player. He explained the situation to his parents and they actually did allow him to persue professional DotA 2. 

He's having a good time no doubt.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just bought my Moto G4 Plus today. Was in the process of updating to Nougat. The update downloaded . After the "Preparing to update" dialogue box reached 100 percent the phone blacked out. When I connected the charger the LEDs at the bottom started blinking. But I am 100% sure that the battery was above 75 percent before it blacked out. 

The phone is completely non responsive at the moment. Please help.

Edit : Issue resolved. Thank you guys.
