	<TEXT> I think [laser drives are the current best bet for fast space travel. Its feasible to have a spacecraft travel from earth to Mars in 3 days using laser drives.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBHQcArA1fM) Nuclear pulse propulsion can produce similar high rates of speed, and the capability to produce a nuclear pulse propulsion powered spacecraft has been around since the 1960's, but the general public is to against it for it to be implemented. [NASA is currently working on nuclear-thermal drives for the Orion program](https://youtu.be/dgILm5veFs0), but these still have transit times to mars of months rather than days a photonic or nuclear pulse drive could produce. </TEXT>
