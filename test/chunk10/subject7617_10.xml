	<TEXT> It works out because they really are the only kids in both our families. So its not like opening up to children means having like 20 of them running around. We are putting them at their own table, right next to their parents. Whats funny is my FMIL at first seemed against them even coming; she gave me the "well its yoooour wedding" response and i basically put my foot down and said yes, it is, and they are invited! it seems you are damned if you do and damned if you dont sometimes! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So im not a parent, but we're having kids at our wedding, because my cousins on my moms side are all much, much younger than me and i am very close to them. I am 30, the eldest is 14 (of 8 of them!).  Her brothers got married and had kids much later than my parents did. Anyway, they look up to me, i see them 3+ times a year, and i couldnt imagine not having them there. We're really close and i love them all dearly! </TEXT>

Aside from a few people the ywanted to invite, which we agreed on upfront, they are not weighing in on anything. ive picked all the vendors, they say "Cool, we trust you." i have made 90% of decisions on my own with FH, and 10% with others only when i needed help. FH's parents aren't like "Well we're paying why arent they doing what we want?" because they see it as a gift. and im SUPER grateful for it, now that i see some others see it as a place to make the wedding aobut them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not that much. A lot of them after i booked them let me know when we'd need to check in again. The DJ, for instance, will be checking in 7 weeks prior and we'll be having one last in person meeting around then. The florist will be checking in about 3 months before. Our officiant sent us a questionnaire to fill out for our ceremony, but we don't have to return that until June, so we haven't heard a peep in between yet. I dont find a need to check in unless i have a specific question! I will be checking in with the caterer in a few weeks to see where we are at with cake offerings (she works with an outside company) but otherwise im not regularly sending emails or anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, this is my speciality! I am a huge Disney World nerd, specifically the parks but also love and grew up with the movies. FH hates it haha but, he knows how important it is to me (like, i went there 3x this year, my first trip i was 2 years old, etc etc).
SO. Pre ceremony music is a mix of piano/violin renditions of I See the Light, Second Star to the Right, Feed the Birds, Ma Belle Evangeline, as well as direct from movies, Married Life from Up, Define Dancing from Wall-E. Some of these instrumental versions are actually taken from Club 33, the special club in Disneyland.

Cocktail hour? The entire Tower of Terror hour long loop. It's all classic 1920s and 30s jazz anyway, so it fits right in with our venue, my FH loves it, and no one will be the wiser except my fellow Disney World geek friends.

Oh, im also walking down the aisle to a softer violin rendition of Princess Leia's theme, which i guess now is "Disney" ha.

	<TEXT> I'm sure! And even though I'm used to NYC being expensive, ive still always been fairly frugal. Grew up in a blue collar family; my dad worked steel work in the city for 30 years (and built some amazing buildings here!) but even though he's doing very well in retirement, we were never my FH's family's level of "doing well". So the cost is cringey even to me and i felt weird typing it out haha but i wanted to just be a realist about how much it costs in these big cities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so, real talk. I feel very guilty about how expensive my wedding is, and im not even paying for it. FH's parents are wealthy, and they see spending money on taking us on vacation, experiences, and this wedding as a "tax free transfer of wealth" as his dad puts it. I know they have the money to do it, but i still feel so much guilt about how expensive its becoming, especially that we're in NYC. I will say that our catering alone is 44k. Yeah. Its insane. But his parents wanted "The best" and are eager to spend the money. And im sitting here like... im going to have this fabulous wedding and im excited... and also like... im going to have this fabulous wedding and it's a waste.  But in the end i know THEY dont see it as a waste, they see it as a gift. So i just keep reminding myself of that. But, you aren't alone. </TEXT>

They will be paying their way for bachelorette party, but they are also planning it, so i assume they will stay within their own budgets. As for gifts,  i got them little monogrammed jewelry dishes and will be getting them each a necklace for the wedding.

	<TEXT> I'm paying for all hair and makeup, however they are paying for their dresses and any accessories. I figure it's the least i can do to offset costs for them. However, i don't think there's anything wrong with asking around "Who wants to get hair and makeup done?" they might find that doing it themselves is more cost efficient. or maybe they want makeup and not hair. give them some options. </TEXT>

My FH's parents are in their 60s, and use Facebook   Twitter quite a lot and enjoy it. And statistically, the older generation is the biggest growing audience on social as years go by. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, social media strategist here! Hashtags are essentially search terms. Come up with an "ownable" one, meaning no one else uses it so it won't get mixed in with random other stuff, and then when someone (or you) search that hashtag in, say, instagram, you'll find all photos tagged with it. It's an awesome way for a couple to see all of the photos people may have taken of the event after the fact. Also as a way to just, document the planning process (ive used my own hashtag in a few instagrams already!). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if it makes you feel better... or caterer is costing us about 3x the cost of our venue... yaaay NYC! 

You don't HAVE to use a caterer. So many  people, especially on this board alone, do the food themselves! Don't feel the pressure. Maybe you DO talk to your mom and say "hey, i totally understand that catering is easier, but it's not within our budget at all." maybe, just maybe she'll offer some money? If not, then she has to deal with the fact that this is where you stand on it. </TEXT>

We're also saving her a seat with a bouquet of flowers, but that won't really be noticeable to anyone but immediate family. </TEXT>

In terms of getting off meds to avoid side effects, unfortunately it takes more than a week to get any antidepressant out of your system.  Was on Wellubtrin long ago and it took at least 2 weeks to get it fully out of my system and then i was hit with really bad withdrawl symptoms. So, i know you already know to talk to your doc, but i really do advise it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Wedding Guest Perspective, NYC Hotel - Oct, 2016 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-07 01:40:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I first want to state i promise in no way to be condescending or insult a couple and their wedding! Ill be as straight forward as possible. I know some people don't like these threads, but I find them really interesting and helpful! Anyway, to the wedding!

This was a wedding at a new hotel in Brooklyn, friend of my fiance's (and her parents are friends with his parents,  close knit group). 

The Good

* The ceremony was held on a rooftop portion of the hotel and it was beautiful! The weather was nice and they had heating lamps which helped when it got a little chilly towards the end.
*  The food was delicious, and I was a big fan of their signature cocktails.
* The couple were so, so lovely and the family was so amazingly supportive. They are a gay couple, and for one half this is the first and only woman she's ever been with, so to see the love and support from her family who were overall "new" to the idea was awesome.
* The DJ was great and had people pretty much on the floor all night!

The Bad

* Because the couple booked the venue before it was actually complete (as in, the hotel was still being built and hadnt opened), the specs didn't exactly size out to the number of guests they had, despite what they were promised. we were very cramped in the cocktail hour space, uncomfortably so, and we waited 30 minutes in a very smushed line for a drink. The dance floor was also too small, people were shoulder to shoulder like a packed concert. This is not the fault of the couple, it's more the fault of the venue overpromising and underdelivering when it was finished. So just a good learning that if you are looking to book a venue that isn't complete, make sure it really ends up the size you need.

* Because it was one of the first weddings the venue had ever done, being brand new, the staff left much to be desired. They had no idea where they were going when placing food, some tables got fed way later than others, and you could tell they were a bit..distressed handling the situation. Same with the bartenders at cocktail hour, they were just overwhelmed with the amount of people and the small space. I felt for them, because when its the first wedding or one of the firsts you ever do, it's gotta be tough.

* They had a friend officiate and she was.. OK. Her nerves made her talk too quickly at times and it was hard to understand what she was saying so i missed a few bits of the ceremony.

That's pretty much it! I just wanted to put out there to make sure you've got a team and a venue that's ready to handle you, even if they are new! Overall though I had a good time, because I mean, i always have a good time at weddings!

	<TEXT> one. i think the second makes you look a bit...well, matronly. its the sleeves and the top in general. I dont think its giving that old school hollywood vibe unfortunately. The first one looks BEAUTIFUL on you, though. Like, take a step back, wow, kind of beautiful! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> do they? I live in NYC so ours run late; prob more like yours! I mean, our bars are open until 4 am! My wedding runs 6pm to 12am and then we'll have an afterparty that will likely run until about 3-4 am. The venue can tech accommodate until 1 am though, legally. </TEXT>
