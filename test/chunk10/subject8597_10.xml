	<TEXT> The best way to show someone how much your butt hurts is to tell someone that they shouldn't knock your shitty opinion.

Shitty. Opinion.

	<TEXT> Jimmie switched the tape before he "destroyed" it. 

Chuck's copy is a simple soundbite of Jimmy's confession.

Jimmy's original copy extends beyond and includes the post confession discussion about Jimmy's reasoning for saying what he did.

This, in addition to Mike's photos and testimony from the ER doc about Chucks delusional behaviour, as well as testimony about  the Mesa Verde fuckup will all lead to dismissal on allegations for Jimmy and unrecoverable disgrace for Chuck.

Jimmy will pause in his victory to consider the brother he just vanquished and weigh remorse against the thrill of eating Chuck alive, and at this time decide to leave Jimmy behind with Chuck, and adopt a more marketable identity in his place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm hoping this spin-off takes the hugs to another level.

Maybe the Mayans can all grind and twerk when shit gets emotional. Lots of below the waist, bro-on-bro contact shots to establish closeness...

I'm imagining Commander Adama boofing Tuco Salamanca right now. It's amazing. Try it. </TEXT>

I kinda dig those wierd buttons. In reach, and relatively out of the way.

And the clamp works way better than I figured it might. Real snug, and so far, not scratchy.

	<TEXT> Sennheiser... still as ugly as they were back when you listened to science class film strips in elementary school, still sound better than most of the prettier, more modern trash out there.

And still second best to Grado.

Good Brand, though. Thanks for this write up. I've been considering a nice over-ear set for my new headset. Using you Sennheisers to measure your AKGs was great!

I think you just talked me into a set of Grado SR-22's. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. 

I ended up in a screening at the Orpheum around the corner from my apartment, thinking it was the Shyamalan flick, and sat through the thing scratching my head at its severe lack of McAvoy until the bean mashing scene hit the screen. This caused the second walk-out in my life.

Guess, I'll check out this one next, as I've yet to see the well-known Split.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool. I thought they blended a bit too well to be anything but, but (butt butt!) I've only ever seen those bands in promo photos. 

That band really makes the gold one look good. Stainless always looks good, but that ugly gold really needed something nice to look other than... Tacky? That band is it. Should have been standard issue.

Wanna sell the Stainless one? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 42.50 in so far, and I've got an OG Pebble, and a Time. Both refurbed and minty. I think it's doable. One month, perhaps two and I'll will hopefully be on my way to seeking out even cheaper repaints. Treat these things like I used to treat Swatches back in '92.

	<TEXT> PTS, 50 new, 35 refurbished

PS, 35 new, 25 refurbished

PTR, 75 new, 50 refurbished

P2, 50 new, 25 refurbished


Prices based on the best I've seen among Amazon, eBay, and Woot.

I found a seller with 8 red P2s for 20 bucks new on Amazon and didn't grab one because I thought it was fishy, told a buddy who snagged one before they were all gone. Haven't seen anything close since.

Ideally, I'd like a complete set for under 200 total. </TEXT>

It's been a while since my loitering days, and I don't think I've eaten in Town East, or West's food courts in a decade...

I was living in Salina when their Sbarro became a Sbarro-type place.

Did that happen here, too? </TEXT>

You know how those guys do at closing time?

10 bucks, take it all. I used to walk out with four or five pizza boxes filled with leftovers for my roommates when I worked at a mall GameStop. 

If that were down the hall, I would rarely shop for groceries. </TEXT>
