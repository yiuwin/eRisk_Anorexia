	<TEXT> Found this old diary of a distant relative in our attic.

I think it provides some interesting insight to the live of a normal soldier from 1939-45.

I did my best to translate it, but the old handwriting is hard to read and my english is not the best.

	<TEXT> In Austria our lawmakers hate modified cars...

Want other wheels than stock? You have to go to a special inspection and have the wheels listed in your vehicles registration certificate.

Coilover suspension ? Get your vehicle inspeced by a civil engineer and get a certificate, also must be listed in registration certificate.

Turbo, Supercharger, Chiptuning, Engine Swap: Almost impossible or very expensive to make road legal, must get inspected by civil engineer, full emission testing, test on dyno etc. etc etc... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just stop by at a coinop carwash and use the high pressure washer with reverse osmosis water. The purified water does not leave any spots and it only costs 50c for a quick wash. </TEXT>
