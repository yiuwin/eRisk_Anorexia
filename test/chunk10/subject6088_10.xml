Do you mean that they switched to a design where all user submitted stuff gets deleted?

Or do you mean when they switched to a new design, they deleted all user submitted posts in the process?

And when are you referring to?

Because this post is allegedly two days old.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah we can agree to disagree. 

For the record I don't think you're wrong in what you're saying. I think that if a player is cheap and you don't want to stoop to their play style just to keep things fair, that's admirable. I just think saying it's not balanced is disingenuous. I agree it's not the intent of the creators to use passive mode as a grief method, but if one wants a level playing field, sometimes you have to play on their level.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally get what you're saying. I was a lot more fond of getting into skirmishes when i had a large crew to rely on and when my friends were in the same lobby more often. 

Nowadays I might retaliate if someone picks a fight but not for long. It's just not as fun. 

But to your point about playing fair, unless people are cheating with mods or wall breaches or whatever, I just can't get onboard with that sentiment. If it's a game function available to everyone, it cannot be called OP or unfair or unbalanced. By definition. 

People used to say the Rhino was OP. I never understood why you didn't just get your own Rhino. How is that unbalanced? Just as an example. 

And before you say the Hydra is OP, make a post about how the Hydra can't be beat and see how many people come out of the woodwork to say how easy it is to dodge a missile or to take out a Hydra using a Buzzard, etc. 

It's all so subjective. And honestly, I think the game is so vast, there are so many things to do, changing lobbies is so easy, and there are so many tools at your disposal that I just don't get why people criticize the game all the time. (Not you, specifically. I get your frustration. I still stand by my assertion that the game is balanced as intended, working as intended and anything people dislike about it is just a preference.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read your comment with an open mind but honestly pretty much everything you said is just your personal preference. 

The level of ease you want it to be is subjective.

Some people might want a challenge in delivery. Others might want more ease in disruption! Who's to say which is more correct? The bottom line is this is how Rockstar WANTS people to interact and battle. If you don't want that level of conflict, that's not that the game is broken or unbalanced. That's really my whole point. 

If this were a single player mode, there would be a difficulty slider. But it's multiplayer so you meet different types of player with different objectives and different skill levels. Just like you would in COD or any other multiplayer game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Things should be nerfed if they're overpowered and cannot be beaten by anything else. It ruins the balance of the game. 

If there's another vehicle that's as good or better, why is it considered overpowered? And if it's not overpowered then why should it be nerfed?!

	<TEXT> That's an interesting analogy. The problem is that the kind of balance you're describing isn't the building block for a game like GTAO while it might be for a game like Rock Paper Scissors. 

You don't always answer someone else's weapon with a counter weapon. Sometimes you just answer with skill or strategy. 

How many times in this sub have you heard complaints that level one noobs have access to a homing launcher and that's not fair toward air attacks? Then someone else says if you can strafe a homing missile, "git gud" etc.

This game designed this game mode to be difficult to do without the help of teammates. That's not imbalance. That's game design. If you work outside of those parameters, you should expect different results.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everything you said is true so I won't dispute any of it. BUT all of it is tempered quite a bit when you have a team with you while delivering. And that's not only the point of my post but the point of the DLCs. 

If you're gonna lone wolf it (and there's nothing wrong with that; I do it all the time. I'm not crapping on lone wolves) you have to know there are risks and those risks aren't the game being broken or unbalanced. It's the lone wolf choosing to be alone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You do have a point about the timing of the ping. 3-seconds is not even enough time to get forward momentum in a Cuban. 

While YMMV on this one, I've only seen one or two people really try to attack a delivery in any fairly-full lobby. And even that's rare. It's not normal to have an entire lobby coming after you. So 20% bonus on a ~$million shipment with one or two people coming after you WHILE you have a couple of buddies watching your flanks is pretty reasonable, to me.

	<TEXT> I can see this being a tunable thing that would increase interaction. But the low-level people who are always the minions in the lobbies I see are probably very happy with $10,000 every 10-minutes or so. That's nothing to kick out of bed. 

The really successful CEOs in this sub can chime in on this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We'll just have to agree to disagree. Because to me, three of my buddies and I versus a couple of trolls on a delivery isn't only doable, but it's fun AND challenging. I think the challenge is the fun. And the times when I'm delivering solo in a crowded lobby just to risk the hostile bonus is nerve wracking and fun at the same time. 

Like I said, it's working as intended. People might not like it but it's not broken.

I'm not fond of turn-based RPGs or flight sims, but I'm not going to say the flight sim needs to more lasers or the fantasy RPG needs a horror mode. (Although now that i say it, that last one sounds kind of cool haha) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's been a lot of talk about griefers and imbalance in the game. The griefer discussion has been going on since launch so I won't get into it too much here and will just say "let people play the way they want to play" and leave it at that. Unless players are cheating, trying to control how other play the game -- even as it relates to and affects you -- is not only futile, but it's hypocritical. 

Regarding what people consider an imbalance in CEO, MC delivery work (because Hydras are OP or camping is a bitch move or whatever,) I can only say that the game design is working as intended. 

The whole point of the last two DLCs is to get players to interact and play together in teams. Be it a motorcycle club or some executive criminal enterprise, the point is to have team members help you make deliveries and finish missions.

If you're playing solo, you risk getting your shit wrecked. I mean you risk that no matter what, but that's not broken game design. It's made that way to heighten risk/reward and to encourage player interaction. 

There are many ways around having to deal with rival CEOs and other trolls; this sub is chock full of ways to circumvent loss and maximize gain. So if this is too rough for someone, there are ways out. But they need get it through their heads that it's *not supposed to be easy* and they think the game should change to suit them, they're gonna have a bad time.  </TEXT>

If there was a way to talk to everyone or see into everyone's souls, I'd say when people are genuinely hurt or genuinely feel bullied, it's griefing if you keep doing it. 

But I'll take it further and say if someone feel this way, they probably shouldn't play this game or play in very limited quantities.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Tunables" refers to code that is installed on your system at the time of a large update. But it is released or "activated" only after prompted to do so from the server. 

So the 2x payout algorithm, for example, gets activated and activated server side. Since the PlayStation 4 has a "sleep" feature that allows programs and games to continue running in a low-power mode (when you're done with the console for the night, for example,) these server-side prompts don't affect the game until you reboot. 

So some of us still have the 2x running on our machines.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on what "worth it" means to you. 

I'll switch to MC work because it's more immersive and the missions are fun. (The delivery mission where the guy riding shotgun gets you high off his second hand smoke is hilarious.)

Money-wise it's hard to argue the time ROI doing CEO work. 

But it becomes such a grind it's good to switch it up once in a while. 

For the record, I have car warehouse; small, medium, and large special crate warehouses; coke lockup, meth lab, counterfeit business and weed farm

So is it worth it? Depends. I for one enjoy having it from a fun point of view as well as a collector's point of view, and it makes money too.  </TEXT>

But you only get the call while you're a CEO and all this time I've only gotten that call once. It's RNG so your mileage may vary. 

Even when you get the call, you have plenty of time to go and shoot some bad guys and get your crates back. Not sure what happens if you fail. Either way, it was actually kind of fun. 

Other than that, there's no disadvantage to waiting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the go-to argument for more critics. "It takes too long to grind!"

Do you remember the early days, pre-moneypocalypse servers? That's the actual proper pace of this game. I played missions and sold Lampadati Felon until I got enough to buy a two-car garage under the overpass. 

Then I played until I was able to buy a 6-car garage and apartment. And finally I got my first 10-car apartment (101 Weazel, still my vote for best penthouse location in the game!) and felt like I had really achieved something. 

Around this time is when I reached level 100 or so. That's how it should be. Slow and steady. At least to me. 

And that's the crux of this argument. How fast the grind should be is purely subjective. I, for one, didn't think players should be driving around in a chrome Adder at level 17. But that's just me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couple of things; you can shut down your business while there are some supplies in it, and it will just stay dormant with no calls from LJT. 

You can customize your map icons by selecting "hide options" in your interactive menu. This should clean up your map quite a bit.

I hope this helps. But yes, I agree we should always have the option to sell things we've purchased. There's no reason from a game point of view that should prevent that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This can't be right because it has been assigned three times. Once without me knowing it. 

1) I logged on after a long hiatus from GTAO and when I hopped on my Sovereign he game assigned it as my favorite. I googled it and learned what it was and started riding my Bagger to get that to be my favorite. 

2) eventually it worked and my Bagger was my favorite. Now I got a new bike that's way better and I want that to be my new favorite so I start riding my Gargoyle religiously

3) it doesn't change. But the other day I notice a street-stolen Ruffian was my favorite even though I never rode it. I collect these sometimes for the tequila-la mission as sticky bomb fodder. I've since blown that ruffian up and replaced its slot in my bike garage. 

So three separate favorite assignments. And none that I'm happy with. 

Additionally, google the topic. It's clear you're supposed to be able to change it but it's either broken or REEEeaally unclear what's supposed to happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the game is designed to be played with teammates. So if you're circumventing this by playing in a empty lobby, then that shit's on you. 

I play in a solo-public all the time so I don't blame you for that. But the game mechanics are the way they are because they want you to play with people. So either figure it out (like destroy the NPCs before you start your delivery, as others have suggested) or just disconnect if you're failing and eat the loss of cargo; try again and hopefully you get a delivery mission that's easier. 

But whatever you do, you can't really blame the game in this instance. If there was a bug or glitch or connection issue which is Rockstar's fault, sure. But this is just a mission that is working as intended. It's your own fault for failing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ... and then cargobob users who are peacefully flying around will ask for armored cargobobs that cannot be taken out by cannon fire because they're being griefed.

Then cargobob pilots will start griefing by picking up people's unattended vehicles. Then people will start complaining that cars should not be able to be picked up by cargobobs.

Then CEOs who i/e cars with Cargobobs will say I/E cars should appear on a public lobby map, ever.

Then the whole game is unbalanced and broken ...

I'm exaggerating, obviously, but to be honest, it's not that big of a problem. The solution is play with friends or make friends in the lobby. You can kill the griefer in no time if you work together. 

This is Rockstar's end-game. 

Everything they do is to promote community interplay and multiplayer interaction. Period. Every new game mode, every DLC, every promo bonus period is designed to promote interaction and teamwork. Just get on a mic and ask for help and you'll have solved 100% of every griefer problem in every openly public </TEXT>
