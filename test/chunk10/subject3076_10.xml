	<TEXT> There are sober 21 year olds out there who don't want to drink anymore. I found young people in AA. I know that sounds like a cop out answer, but it was my reality. I was 25 and wanted a new life. I found one. But I didn't find it hanging out with the same people, doing the same things, and not changing. I had to be open, honest and willing to do what it took. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found that I was addicted to the cycle of destroying myself and then taking care of myself. Destroy, pick up pieces, destroy, pick up pieces. After awhile I just started to destroy and laugh at the destruction I caused. I was very sick.

I stopped by getting honest, becoming willing to do anything and open to looking at things differently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome.

I found the best way to fight the liquor store was to engage in recovery activities throughout the day and have a plan. I also admitted to myself, and did a lot of work (writing it out), on what happens when I drink.

I had to decide if the person I was with alcohol was worth living for. She wasn't. Drunk Victoria isn't who I want to be. 

I don't think there are any tricks or tips. Honestly for me it was a lot of work. I had to dig deep. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always think about my motive when telling people. What do I need from them that I am not receiving elsewhere? 

Families can surprise, or they can continue the patterns they know and trust. 

For me, I had to build and find support systems outside of my family. They were too emotionally invested and I couldn't say anything to them without them reacting. I found support in AA and then later on, through recovery organizations and volunteering. My biggest support network is here on SD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I felt the same way. I was quite committed to AA for around 9-10 months, attending at least 3-4 meetings a week and getting involved with volunteering.

I decided that at some point I wanted to go to the gym at night, or go out for dinner with friends, or go to a movie.

For me sobriety is about balance. I didn't want to attend AA meetings as my only activity for the rest of my life. So I expanded my social world and life. I also started volunteering with recovery organizations, learning about peer support organizations, and got a career in the social services world. I'd say my life is more connected to recovery than it was when I was going to AA 3-4 times a week.

It is extremely slight. Pretty much nonexistent. Maybe I could take medication to help, maybe I could do this, maybe I could set up rules and consequences.

	<TEXT> So, people who are in chronic pain and rely on opiates can be considered "physically dependent" but we would hesitate to call them addicted.

I guess addiction tends to encompass the idea of experiencing cravings, perhaps using to overcome withdrawal effects, using early in the morning, continued use despite negative consequences etc.

For me I was psychologically and physically dependent on alcohol AND I was definitely addicted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely. I actually met my husband at the gym. I figured I'd either meet someone through AA, the gym or playing board games. I decided that I didn't necessarily want to marry someone who was recovering from substance abuse. And I didn't want to use meetings as a way to meet guys, that didn't feel right.

I started working at a gym to meet likeminded people, and ended up asking my husband on a date. And here we are.

I think it's super respectful you don't want to take advantage of people who are drinking. There are lots of avenues to pursue relationships outside of bars :) </TEXT>

For example

Addiction took over my life, and had a lot to do with genetics and brain chemistry, and other factors that are simply out of my control. It can happen to anyone. It caused me a lot of problems and a lot of pain for everyone involved. However, I was able to stop drinking and try to do better - it was not easy and sometimes I have fallen a few times on the road to recovery, but I have done it.

	<TEXT> I took Campral as part of my treatment plan that included group therapy, exercise, writing, journalling, and seeing a psychologist.

A drug couldn't fix my problem. I think it certainly helped me achieve my goals and lessen my cravings so that I could pay attention in group though :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why do we have coffee every day. Why do we eat food. Why do we have sex.

Everything we do changes our brain chemistry. There are entire views of human beings as pleasure seeking machines.

Throughout documented history, humans have found things that change the way we feel and think about the world. And throughout history, society has viewed these things as bad or good, respectable or deplorable.

Smoking itself has a tainted history. 30 years ago you could smoke everywhere, now you can't smoke within 10 metres of most buildings. We're learning that smoking does real damage. We aren't really there yet with alcohol. 

Public perception towards "drugs" is completely fucked up and in my opinion, highly prejudiced. 

We're all drug users. I'd hazard to say a huge percentage of the population misuses and abuses very generic and popular "drugs" like Tylenol and Advil. 

So why does AA and NA have smoking? Probably for a lot of reasons. 

Our society believes "drug users" are people who inject heroin and are homeless. But suburban mom who takes 10 advil a day is just managing her pain. Guy who smokes only when he drinks is considered a "casaul smoker" not a "drug addict"

Society is all over the map with drug use. And that's reflected in AA and NA because AA and NA are made up of people who are not different from the rest of the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was hard to quit drinking when I didn't think I deserved or wanted a better life for myself.

What started my whole process of recovering was the stubborn belief that I might hate myself, but I could NOT put my parents through losing another daughter. I had an older sister who died at three days old. My self talk went from "I fucking hate myself and want to die" to "I fucking hate myself but I cannot die from alcoholism right now."

Since then I've built up to believing that I am worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like you're getting quite impatient with the process.

What does being cured look like? Rehabs who offer a cure for addiction are not in line with millions of dollars of research into addiction and its treatments.

For me I was lucky enough to be able to attend rehab. It is absolutely a privileged thing. It can be expensive, it takes time away from family and friends and work. And it isn't easy. It's hard work.

I needed professional help. I started with my doctor, who worked with my psychologist and an addiction counsellor to create a treatment plan that I followed. No one can tell you what you'll need to "beat this". </TEXT>

Your local addiction agency might have information on peer support. There are also peer support workers that work in most recovery centers/homeless shelters/social services that can meet with you. As well, many cities have their own peer support organizations that have groups, trainings and meet and greets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How does one simply love oneself in the face of insurmountable evidence to the contrary without approaching delusion?

For me, it was a matter of being practical. What if I chose to like myself? How would that change my life? I'm a pragmatist above all else.

I also think that it just as delusional to hate myself as it is to love myself. The middle ground for me is tolerating my self.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The heart of the matter is that I don't love myself enough to believe that I'm worth staying sober for, and I know that sounds awful and pathetic, but that's just where I'm at.

I don't think it sounds awful or pathetic. Your entire post shows that you have a high level of insight and sometimes that's really hard. Knowing I hate myself, and doing something about it...for me there was a big barrier between those two things. 

And then I was frustrated because what, now I have to learn how to fucking love myself? Fuck. I've done ENOUGH already to get sober. It wasn't fucking fair that I needed to do more.

Sooner or later I realized I didn't have to do anything to stay sober. I just need to commit to never drinking, ever. One day at a time stopped working for me, because I wanted more. I wanted to plan bigger, and not live in such a small bubble of safety and "ODAT"

My love life started by meeting someone at the gym. I got out of myself, out of the recovery world (I was quite isolated inside of it) and realized that people in the "real world" had problems too. I fit in just fine. I didn't need to be special or consider myself different because I was sober. I could date whoever I wanted and keep myself safe: that was in my control. </TEXT>

I do not drink. Ever. Over anything. 

For me it's a mix between fear of ruining my life, and the drive and pull to be better.

I also made sure I knew the consequences of my drinking. I did some pretty uncomfortable work with a sponsor in AA and a therapist in treatment to really look at WHAT happens when I ingest alcohol.

I think fear is healthy. For me, the fear of drinking again has lead me to do a lot of work. </TEXT>
