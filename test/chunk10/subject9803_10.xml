As for your stars. I feel like you could do a could things.

1) Ink it up how you did, then kinda mono type the stars by going in and overwiping dots in with like a fine q tip or a rag pulled around a pencil or something. 

2) burnish some spots to lighten them up. 

3) maybe do a chine-colle 

4) etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yah, honestly, layering/ and using transparent inks take time to get used to, but you'll save you a lot of time if you keep making multicolor prints. I always say i'm a lazy printmaker, so i try to take every shortcut (within reason) to save myself time. work smart, not hard

	<TEXT> Looks nice. It might make your life easier if you work with transparent inks and overlapping to get just as many colors with less screens. (red+yellow=orange/ blue+yellow=green). If you look at the work of Jay Ryan (the bird machine) he gets so many colors outta 2-3 color layers, split fountains and overlapping. Just a thought. Anyway your print looks nice   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been working with litho for about the past year, specifically photo lithography. I always describe them as photolithos but if someone's calls them lithos I don't mind, since it's basically the same  end result, you just just use all the chemicals. I mean many of my favorite lithographer (such as ericka walker   Michael Barnes) often use plate litho

And I guess outa any process I think I hear various prints called silk screens more than anything else. 

I mean if some "casual"(nonprontmaker) called a dollar bill an intaglio, I'd be more excited that they "basically" got it right instead of being upset that they don't fully understand the our specialized vocabulary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like the other comment said, make what you like. If you get into the art world/ market thinking you need to sell art in order to be "successful" and it doesn't take off, your going to have a bad time. If you make what you love and if people appreciate it, and want to buy it, great. If not your still improving and doing something you like. 

I'd recommend looking for smaller art/ vendor fairs, (not the big $300 art fairs) and just taking some work out. Even if you dont sell anything it's a great way to get out and have people talk to you about what you are doing, and if you sell, great! Idk my first booth was at a free street fair, and I talked to like 50+ people, sold some stuff, but those conversations/ people being genuinely interested was almost more encouraging than sales.... I mean money is good, and keeps a roof over my head, but idk I'd often rather bullshit with someone for 20 minutes about art/whatever than have someone walk into my booth, say " that matches my living room, I'll buy it"

Follow your passion (responsibility) and let the rest sort itself out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of things could be leading to this. We have no idea if these are made with a press, or by hand, what type of ink you use, and thus it's kinda hard to give you a blanket "do this" to solve everything. 

Possible solutions:
More ink
Different ink
More pressure 
Even out the pressure
Add some miracle gel
Add a bit of oil
Print with felts 
Print with felts and a board 
Etc etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this looks really clean on the internet, id be interested to see it in person, and how the ink sits on the image. I feel like you might get some pushback from the traditional print community for kinda "cheating" with your color, but as long as your upfront about it I think you'll be ok. 

Anyway looks nice.  </TEXT>
