	<TEXT> Yes! I haven't thought about that in YEARS. My sister had a part in a youth production of that musical and I remember loving that song, but I haven't looked at the lyrics since I was a kid. Will have to revisit... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thom signed my ticket stub in 1997 right after playing a small show in a Cleveland high school auditorium. This was just months before the band's popularity skyrocketed. The black blob on the right was made by smudging the ink with his thumb.

It was the best show I've ever seen - or ever will see - in my life. My friends and I were freshmen in college. Our seats were in the 6th row, but we managed to slither right up to the stage for most of the show. In the middle an electrical storm killed the power in the venue for a good 5 minutes, so we just all screamed and shouted while Thom made remarks in the dark from the stage. 

On account of the glitch, the band decided to play an extra long set when the power came back on. For the encores, a bunch of folks were screaming "Play Creep!" but we knew they didn't want to, so we all decided to suggest something more obscure. We yelled "Play Killer Cars!" Thom shrugged and they played it.

The most magical thing about the event was getting to hear them play the OK Computer set right as their fame was rising to a peak. They'd already outgrown the venue but the tour was booked before the critical response to that album was so resounding. The track from that album that connected with me the deepest was "Climbing up the Walls" - it played a crucial role in an important time in my life, and I'll always remember hearing them play it live.

After the show, a group of fans huddled near the tour buses hoping to meet them. Eventually we got Johnny and Thom to walk over. Johnny was pretty friendly, but it was clear that Thom was a bit uncomfortable, especially when so many fans kept telling him how beautiful his voice was.

My buddy, who happened to be a brilliant artist, decided to ask Thom about the album artwork, rather than the music. He asked about Stanley Donwood and the White Chocolate Factory, mentioning how much he loved the album art. Thom walked right over to us and was excited to discuss the art. Especially learning Photoshop and working with multi-layered images.

After a brief chat we abashedly asked him to sign our ticket stubs. Thom wrote his name as shown in the image, then used his right thumb to smudge a blob of ink. It's not super obvious on mine that it was created with his thumb, but on some of my friends' it left more of a fingerprint smear.

So that's how I met Thom and got his signature, right before he became a global celebrity. I just found this subreddit today and thought it would be worth sharing. I'd love to hear if others had run-ins with the band in the early years before they were huge. Cheers. </TEXT>

Yours is looking good, but the Bends! You gotta add the Bends and then I will feel satisfied :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Start with rhythm. If you don't think about the rhythm of the melody with some intentionality, then you will often fall into boring rhythmic patterns song after song.

Once you have a melody rhythm that works for you, then try starting on a few different intervals (e.g. the root, the major or minor third, the fifth) to see what feels right as an anchor to start on. The root is often the safe but boring choice. 5ths feel a bit cold. 3rds often feel emotional, melodramatic if used too often.

Once you have your rhythm and starting point, your own instincts will carry you forward.

I think many songwriters come up with one melody and then stop if its good enough. I would also encourage you to keep going. Write 4 or 5 alternatives (unless you're just in love with the first one) and then try to compare them objectively. Ask a close friend which one they like best.

I often fall in love with a couple of the different melody ideas and end up using one as a counter-point harmony beneath the other in the bridge or later in the song. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm wondering if this is a common exercise. It was a great primer for eager history buffs. And it turns out Joel himself is an avid history nut, as described on the Wikipedia page for the song: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Didn%27t_Start_the_Fire

Some of the topics I remember finding the most interesting were:

Bernie Goetz
Belgians in the Congo
Space Monkey
Children of Thalidomide

Just wondering how many others on this board ever dove into that song, and the underlying stories, just for fun? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great technique. I'm guessing you can get paid gigs with this kind of skill. It produces a very clean and polished look. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've got a great voice, which is such an amazing tool for a songwriter. I really enjoyed the song - has a good hook, nice dynamics. I enjoyed falling action into the bridge and then the swell leading to the end of the song. Nice mix too, with the drums not doing too much and good guitar work.

Congrats on getting this out there. </TEXT>
