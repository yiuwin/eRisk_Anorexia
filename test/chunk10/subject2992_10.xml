	<TEXT> I had a thyroidectomy when I was 11. There was like a 1/200 chance that my vocal cords would be cut by accident during the surgery since the thyroid and vocal cords are literally right next to each other.

	<TEXT> One time I was sitting in my kitchen eating lunch and looking out the window. It was super sunny outside--not a single cloud in the sky. Then, all of a sudden, almost like a reverse camera flash, the sun dimmed, but in a flash. It was like someone clicked a camera shutter, but instead of lighting everything up, everything was darkened. The whole thing lasted about 3-5 seconds and holy shit I was so confused. I think I posted about it the day that it happened, but everyone was like, "lol ever heard of clouds?" And it's like, yeah, but that doesn't explain how it flashed. With clouds it's kind of like dimming a light, where it dims gradually, but this was like sunny, not sunny, then sunny again within a few seconds. I have no idea how to explain that.

**TL;DR: The sky flashed right before my eyes on a perfectly sunny day with no clouds.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've posted this on several threads in the past and I think I'm gonna do a YouTube video or a few YouTube videos because I've had so many downright weird experiences. 

I just wanna say that in my old house, I'm pretty sure it was the spirit of a young girl (my mom and I heard a little girl say, "mamma?" in the middle of the night on one occasion   I'm an only child). I'd also always find toys laid out in my room after leaving the room for a few minutes. I'd come back in and where there wasn't before, there'd be a stuffed animal on the floor in the middle of my room. This kept happening on multiple occasions over the span of like 6 or 7 years. And not only toys would move, but random objects. I was about to go to bed one night and decided to put eyedrops in. I had the eyedrops in my hand and a tissue box right next to me on the night stand. So I put the eyedrops in and I reach for a tissue to wipe my eyes, but the tissue box isn't there anymore. I was really confused because it had JUST been there. Then I sit up and see the tissue box on the other side of my room on my dresser. This happened in the span of about 5-10 seconds. I also had the door to my room shut, so there was no way that my mom or dad could've walked in without me hearing or seeing them. Then I thought, "Oh, good. The ghost is trolling me." 

Edit: I don't live in that house anymore. I moved out when I was 14. The tissue box thing happened a few weeks before my parents and I moved out.  </TEXT>
