	<TEXT> How has Cirie started flawed at all this season? Yes that's how she started in Panama but right now we're talking about only the edit of this season. Cirie started out a huge threat this season who everyone wanted to vote out first because she was too good, and it wasn't until after the merge that she showed any signs of weakness. That's completely different from David.

Brad was presented as flawed in the beginning because he was a premerge boot in his last season, and his reliance on wwmd shows that. It's not a perfect match but it's close.

And Cirie has Jay's edit because she was shown in the premerge, but not as visibly as others, and now in the postmerge is the underdog whose alliance was targeted out of the gate hoping to squeeze her way into the finals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved this episode but I'm so fucking sick of this show robbing us of any sort of victory or catharsis as viewers. If neither Reiner or Bertholt dies, I'm going to be so frustrated because with them plus Annie crystallizing before dying the enemies feel way too invincible...I can understand making the protagonists lose to show growth throughout the story, but after two seasons having them come inches away from killing an enemy and then lose only because of some random plot device makes for a highly unsatisfying and annoying watch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sophistication is a hard thing to define, but I do think sophistication of content is important, and it has to do with what is considered academic and what isn't. Something like Anna Karenina is a sophisticated example because it has been studied in academia and is considered, maybe arbitrarily, maybe not, to be canonical. Something like Survivor, though, which is contemporary, not studied in academia, and made mostly for the purpose of entertainment. It's not a sophisticated example. Do I necessarily agree with it? No, but when you are taking an AP test that isn't the place for you to talk about whatever you want to talk about; it's about realizing there is an appropriate time and place for different subjects. </TEXT>
