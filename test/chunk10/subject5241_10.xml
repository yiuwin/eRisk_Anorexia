	<TEXT> Depends on the day I'm a nursing student it's usually helping patients really anyway possible
Always 
Stay focused and keep the drive goin.
Annoying- the rude impatient patients who either are just rude or rude and don't need to be there 
4 years for BSN(on year 2)
Best part is when patients end up ok
Worst is when you want to help but there's nothing that can be done, or a young person coding(not breathing or heart beating) and dying.

Another tip, study often, study now even if it's just the summer.

I feel rewarded 
Also sorry it's a jumbled mess I have had no sleep  </TEXT>
