	<TEXT> I really couldn't get my head around the last question because i got to a point where I got arctan(-cot theta) and I didn't know where to go from there. I also forgot to account for the overlapping side in the perimeter of the rectangle for the window even though I counted the overlapping side for the semi circle. But I think I did OKAY otherwise, except for the mathematical induction question and how I missed out on the binomial question I still don't know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My end goal is to get into robotics. Does this program prepare me enough for that? My only uncertainty about this is that since this is a 3 year program, unlike the usual 4 year bachelor's degrees in North America, I might not be good enough to do a master's in Canada or the USA, which I plan to. Do you or someone you know have experience with applying outside of Europe for a Master's degree? 

Also, is it easy/possible to find work for an international student after completing my degree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would probably need to take out a loan, on top of my student bursary to finance my first year at McGill. I know that there's financial aid available for the following years but it's the first year that I'd have to show liquidity for. Would you advise me, an international student to take loans for an engineering course at McGill? Like do you think it's viable, considering that for education in 2nd, 3rd and 4th years I'd have to rely on my chances for need-based financial aid? If you do recommend me taking a loan, where would I take it from? </TEXT>
