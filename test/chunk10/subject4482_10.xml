Rig arcana votes knowing that a juggernaut arcana would get a shit ton of buyers while nobody really cares about wisp.

Insert an Easter egg in the jugg arcana referencing the rigged vote to pass the whole thing off as a joke. 

A year later, create a meme-y wisp arcana to win the hearts of memers. Basically targets the portion of the market that didn't buy/ are not interested in the jugg arcana. 

Insert it as a reward in the battle pass to look like it's consolation prize, in some way an act of giving back to the community. What really happens is the battle pass sales is greatly boosted. Technically you can level up your battle pass without spending money but it's at lvl245 so let's be real - it's a $100 meme arcana.

And people are actually glorifying it just because it references Portal. It's like the video game hats version of an alternate ending DVD set for some silly popular sitcom.

	<TEXT> The existence of that genre speaks nothing about its popularity or market share in relation to the whole of the PC games market. It's undoubtedly a niche genre, having a specific target audience, that is heavy consumers of Japanese media which more or less translates to anime lovers.

Considering that in addition to the fact that a portion of their target audience already have a 3DS copy of the game, there is little reason for them to put in resources to port the game over to PC. Mind you, an actual port isn't as straightforward as putting a rom into an emulator. And even then, to put the game on steam would mean their already meagre profit would be further reduced since steam takes a cut of the sales.

If you think "it's still profit to be earned for little work", that's not the case either. While porting might be insignificant compared to developing a whole game from scratch, they'd still need one person at the very least dedicated to the project. And that would mean they would need to find and pay additional people. Would the sales justify the expense ultimately? </TEXT>
