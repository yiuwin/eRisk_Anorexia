	<TEXT> So stoked to hear this!! What a great post. :) Can I ask if you did any other treatment for your ED? The only reason I ask is this is so similar to something I posted about a year ago. Only difference is I thought I was over it but I've been relapsing really really badly the past several months. The only time I look at myself and realize that I'm like.. sickly skinny is when I'm high. It's crazy (and I know this makes ME sound crazy) but looking at myself in the mirror after I've smoked is NOT the same this I see when I haven't. I actually SEE what I look like instead of just...fat. And sometimes I can get myself to eat then. But even then most of the time I have that voice in the back of my head telling me that I can't because I know when I'm not high anymore I'll hate myself for it. Any advice on what worked for you? Sorry this is kind of personal, ha. I'm just out of answers. Thanks for posting! Much love. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My parents moved to the US from Australia before I was born. All of my family still lives in Australia (Melbourne area) and I'm planning on going out for a while at the end out this year. I've been wondering what the weed scene is like there. I suspect some of my cousins may smoke but I don't know for sure.. haha. This is encouraging to see though!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One week. 7 days. I was 7 fucking days away from 6 months clean. And I let stupid fucking bullshit that, in the long run, doesn't matter all that much get inside my head and break me down. I broke and called up an old friend that I knew would have shit. I feel like such a fucking idiot right now. Spent the past 3 days using. It's been about 9 hours since I came down from the last time. And I fucking swear that WILL be the last time. I remember how much withdrawals suck a little bit too well. But that was coming off of 3 years of using. Anyone have any advice or knowledge of what level of withdrawals I'll get after this? Will there really be any after only that long? Any thoughts are more than welcome. Much love to you all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't posted here in ages. And honestly, I've been doing great lately. Until this past weekend. It's not like anything major even happened. Just stupid shit that's getting me down. I got in a huge fight with the kid who's one of my best friends. He's the reason I even managed to get clean. I don't really even understand why the fight happened. He got really pissed off one night and started punching shit and freaking out. I've seen him like that before. I've seen him dent a car punching and seen him with broken hands and shit after getting in fights. But this night was bad. After he apologized and said I probably didn't want to be around him anymore. So I was honest and told him that when he gets like that it makes me nervous because, even though I know he wouldn't hit me, anytime I've been around a guy like that I always end up taking a punch and it scares me to be around that. He knows I have a history of a seriously abusive relationship, so I thought he would understand. But when I told him that he called me a bitch, told me to fuck off and never talk to him again. I tried to talk to him about it and explain but he just told me that I labeled him as a woman beater and told me to fuck off. We work together and he lives in the apartment next to me so there's no way I can NOT see him everyday. We hung out every fucking day. He really is the reason I've been able to stay clean. He's been my everything the past few months. I know it's a stupid thing to let fuck me up but ever since it happened I've been freaking out and all I want to do is get loaded. I don't know how much longer I'm going to last. I know I can't really afford it, I know it will just fuck things up more if I give in. But damn. I can't stop thinking about it. I don't know what to do. Figured I'd come back here for a little support. You guys are all great. Hope things are going well for you all. Much love. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> First time poster. Struggling with guilty feels about my PTSD. Any advice gladly welcome. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all, I don't really know if this is the right place to post so I apologize if I'm doing anything wrong here. I'm 19. I was diagnosed with moderate to severe PTSD a few months ago, stemming from severe physical and sexual abuse that took place about 3 years ago. It's definitely fucked up a lot in my head in a lot of ways for a long time, but I never tried to get help or see a therapist or anything like that until recently which was when I was given the diagnosis of PTSD. I don't know why that almost makes it harder.. but it does in way. I feel..guilty. And stupid. And pathetic. In that meeting the therapist told me that having a diagnosis with it would help be able to treat it and recover from it. But I hate that she gave it to me. I feel like the stereotypical PTSD is war veterans. Thats what I always thought of when I heard it. I feel so stupid and pathetic that I'm claiming the same struggle and issue as someone who has been in a war. I can't imagine the things people in that situation have been through. I can't imagine dealing with that. I feel pathetic trying to compare myself to them. Like I just need to grow up and get over it. But I can't for some reason. I have night terrors about it almost every single night. I can't be in public or large groups of people without my anxiety flaring up. I can't be alone with a guy without going into panic mode. I can't see people with any physical trait even vaguely resembling him without getting nervous. I don't know what's wrong with me. I get so angry at myself for struggling with it. It's been three goddamn years. You'd think I'd be over it by now. What right do I have to be struggling this hard when there are people out there who've been through much worse? I haven't told anyone close to me about it because I'm scared they'll think I'm stupid and just trying to get attention. Any one else struggle with that sort of feeling? How do you deal with it? 


TL,DR: I feel guilty because I don't feel like the cause of my ptsd measures up to what I've always thought of when I heard ptsd. Anyone else struggle with that/how do you deal with it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion I don't think it would be hard to keep it recovery related. Anything positive or helpful in any way, to me, is recovery related. It doesn't have to be NA literature or something like that to be recovery related. Damn. I think just the act of caring about someone enough to want to give them a gift is recovery related. Hardest part of staying clean for me right now is just feeling lonely as fuck ALL THE TIME. Any positive interaction at this point is recovery related for me. As pathetic as that sounds. haha. I'd be down.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I lost all of my friends when I started doing heroin. And then got new friends that also did that sort of thing. And then started trying to get clean, consequently losing all of those friends too. Well. Kind of. I mean they all still hit me up pretty regularly to hang out. I've tried the whole be friends with them just do different things. Turns out I'm capable of that for about a week, 2 tops, before I'm using again. I'm really, really struggling to make new friends. I will openly admit that I'm weird as fuck. Which is fine. I fully embrace it. Couple that with ridiculously shyness though... Meeting new people isn't my strong point.

I'm telling myself that it's way better to be 19 with zero social life spending weekends by myself at home than being a drug addict. But damn. It would be super nice to say yes to some plans every once in a while. 

Anyone else struggle with social life after quitting? Advice for getting over the speed bump? I know it isn't a big deal. But it just feels like this is the time of my life that I'm supposed to be out DOING things, going to parties, whatever. Not sitting at home watching That 70s show and reading the biography of the Constitution. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so glad things are working out well for you. I don't know why I haven't been able to see that for myself yet. It just doesn't seem like things are any better. I mean, logically, I know they are. But emotionally, it doesn't feel that way. Since I started getting clean, my eating disorder has really flared up again. That's probably not helping anything. I'm just struggling to see how the way I'm living now is better than before. I'm not any happier. If anything, it's worse because I can't at least take the edge off every now and then. Things are just so... real. Maybe I wasn't fully prepared for that. I know it'll get better. Things always do. But for now... I'm just a little stuck I guess. Much love. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm struggling. Damn. I feel like I've been struggling for a long time. I just can't seem to kick this. I have 26 days clean. But god I never wake up without thinking about it. I've been trying to figure out why I'm having such a hard time. It got me thinking to why I'm trying to get clean. I mean... I can think of all the cliche reasons. I have more money now. I'm not AS sick all the time.. But.. I don't know. When I really think about it and I'm actually honest with myself.. I didn't decide to try because I wanted to. It was for a boy. (Laaaaaame I know) He's my best friend in the world. And yes because I'm a stupid girl, I've fallen for him pretty damn hard. When he found out I was an addict, he basically told me if I was using he wasn't going to be in my life. He means the world to me. So I decided to give it a shot. He's been great. He let me come stay with him while I detoxed. He was such a sweetie. He's had my back with some dealers. He's honestly been THE ONLY person in my life who's been support of me. But.... things are changing between us a little bit. He's still my best friend, but there's been a shift. He's going to court on Tuesday. I'm so, so scared he'll get convicted and I'll lose him. God I don't know what I'll do. When I think about it.. I don't know if I'm doing this for me. Or if I'm doing it for him. I don't know if I'll be strong enough to do it for myself without him yet.

What made you make the decision to quit? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've been through a lot together. A hell of a lot. Some where along the way, I fell for you. So hard it's not even funny. You know. We've talked about it. I told you I care about our friendship more than being in a relationship with you so I could handle it. And I can. But thing is... it's wearing me a bit. First of all, I never should have slept with you. God it was amazing. I just felt..safe. I haven't felt that in so long. You don't know I was raped. You don't know how huge it is for me to have been able to share that with you and not have melt down. But I know it didn't mean really anything to you. That hurts. But that's my fault, not yours. 

What's really getting to me, making me think maybe I can't be okay with this.... It's hard to explain. I know you care about me. A lot. But I just feel like I'm giving you everything I possibly can and getting nothing in return. Whenever I want to hang out, go get a coffee, watch a movie, whatever you're always the one that's down to go with me. I hang out with you more than I even hung out with my "bff" in high school. Seriously, it's a little ridiculous how often we're together. I see you every day, then we go to work together, then I normally crash at your house, then wake up and do it all over again. I wouldn't trade that for anything. But... sometimes just being there isn't enough. I know you're going through a lot shit right now. You have court coming up. I know you're stressing. I do EVERYTHING I could possibly do to be there for you when you need me. Even you've told me that I'm the one you can always count on when you're struggling. It breaks my heart to see you struggling as much as you do. But damn. Why is it that whenever I need you to be there for me... you just aren't? I don't feel like I can talk to you about shit when things are rough. I don't feel like you give me even half of what I give you. That's hard. I called you in tears. I told you some shit had happened and I just didn't want to be alone and asked if I could come over. All you said was I'm not home. You didn't even ask what was wrong. Why the hell didn't you ask me if I was okay? If I mean as much to you as you say I do, why the fuck don't you ever ask me if I'm okay? Why am I never allowed to be the the one who's having a bad day?

I don't know how much more I can give without getting anything in return. I'm terrified you'll get convicted for complete bullshit and I'll lose you. I don't want to lose you. For any reason. But this is really wearing on me. You were the ONLY person there when I was trying to get clean. You let me stay with you while I detoxed, made me tea, held me while I sobbed and shook sick as fuck.. But now I don't know for sure if I'm doing it for me or for you. If it's still just for you... I don't know if that's enough anymore. I'm scared of what happens if I lose you. I don't know if I'm strong enough to do this for me yet. 

I guess all I really want to say is... Do you still care? At all? Or did everything get messed up when we slept together? Am I just the girl you fucked now? My heart is a little broken. 

Please. Just for once, show me you care again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OH MY GOD. First of all THANK YOU. SO MUCH for sharing this. Damn. I was diagnosed with purge-type anorexia (didn't eat anything and when I did, threw it up) about 5 years ago. Last time I was hospitalized for it was about 2 and a half years ago. I had a reasonable ish hold on it. I mean I won't say I didn't concern myself with it in any way. I struggled a little bit. I mean, I never really made an effort to actually fix it. I just had to maintain a certain weight to do certain things so I did what I had to some of the times. But as soon as I started getting clean, all of it came back. HARD. I've been struggling with it so much since I've been mostly off drugs. It freaks me out. I don't really know what to do. But it's a total replacement. I won't lie about it. Being obsessive over numbers and food and working out and everything else is like taking the place of obsessing over getting high and getting my next fix. There's honestly no way to explain it. There's a ridiculous amount of comfort in it. (yeah I know how fucked up that sounds) Bulimia, almost more so than anorexia in my opinion, is a total emotional release thing. We use drugs to not deal with emotions and thoughts and whatever else. And when you hear "experts" or therapists or whatever talk about bulimia, they use kind of the same terminology. They like to spew bullshit about how it's like purging out the thoughts you don't want to deal with. I don't know. Just a slight parallel in my mind there. Not to mention that there are physical reactions to throwing up. I'm sure your body is releasing at least some amount of good feeling chemicals. from adrenaline to dopamine.. I don't really know all the science behind that. 

Sorry this was kind of all over the place. More than anything I just wanted to say you are most definitely not alone. I think eating disorders add a whole new level of fucked up-ness to trying to get clean. It's hard and it's INCREDIBLY hard to try to explain to someone .who hasn't been through it. Talk to people. Reach out. Hell, message me. I know what it's like. I would LOVE to give you a place to vent. haha. This is one of the things that has been complicating my recovery more than anything else. It's good to know I'm not alone either. Much love. Seriously, pm me any time. Hope things get better for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty okay actually. First time I've said that in weeks. It's my birthday today which I wasn't really expecting anything from. Birthdays have never been a big deal in my family. Just kind of another day. But it's only noon and it's already been a super great day. I was a little worried about it because this is the first birthday I've had since I started getting clean. So I wasn't really sure what was going to happen, no parties for this girl. haha. But I woke up to like 10 people in my apartment. All of them people who know I'm trying to make changes. Some of them I haven't talked to in years because my drug addiction pushed a lot of people away. But people they were all there to make sure I have a good day WITHOUT drugs. And then one of my very, very best friends in the entire world texted me and asked if I'd go to her first meeting with her tonight. I haven't been to a meeting in ages. But it's seriously the best birthday present I could have asked for. I sort of had to cut her off a little bit because I  knew I couldn't be around her while she was using and not use myself. I never really pushed her to make the same choice I did. But I am so beyond fucking happy that she's ready to start getting clean and she wants me to be there with her. So looks like I'll be going to meetings a bit more often now. haha. Hope everyone is having an awesome day. :) </TEXT>

Though I don't know you personally, in my mind you are one of the best people I've had the opportunity to associate with with. I know not everyone agrees with this, but as far as I'm concerned, who gives a fuck if you smoke weed? You know you better than anyone else. If you can do that without it jeopardizing other things, that's completely up to you. I've always been under the impression that this sub was a JUDGEMENT FREE community. That's totally your prerogative. I still smoke here and there. I mean, I don't have tons of clean time behind me so I guess I'm kind of a bad example. But like I said, it's your choice.

	<TEXT> I don't have tons of scientific facts to back me up here so maybe this isn't even the right place to respond. But it struck a cord with me because it's kind of my life right now. I'm currently trying to get clean off of opiate abuse. Been about 5 months since seriously heavy use and 12 days since the last use. One of the biggest changes I've noticed (from before I started using) since I've stopped being too high to notice anything is the way my brain functions. Before I started using, I was pretty intelligent. I mean I wasn't a genius or anything. But I did well in school, was in all advanced placement college classes,  and got a 32 on the ACT. By junior year of high school I had 18 college credits (at that point I was still in the earlier stages of use. I was addicted sure. But it wasn't massively large quantities.) Senior year I still managed to keep things together fairly well. Managed to pull of a 3.8 gpa by graduation. But a couple months into my freshman year of college I decided it was time to try and clean up. Things were getting out of hand. I wasn't going to classes, wasn't going anywhere good, whatever. A lot of things led to that realization, not what I'm trying to get at. Ever since then, my head just WILL NOT work the way it used to. I can't focus the way I used to be able to. And forget remembering anything. I can study something for literally hours and it will be gone the next day. I NEVER had that problem before. That was the one thing I knew I was good at. I had zero problem memorizing anything. I had an uncanny ability to remember things actually. Now... That's gone. I hate it. Like I said, I don't have any facts or science to back this up. But I know what I experienced. And intellectually, I firmly believe that my drug abuse played a huge role in where I'm at now. I've been enrolled at my university since I was a junior in high school. I was doing the college level workload so it's not just me not being able to handle college. My brain just ins't processing things and retaining them the way they used to be. I started a new a little while ago. It requires some computer work and a lot of memorization and attention. I thought it would be no problem. I didn't factor in what my head is doing now.  I don't really know how to explain it. This probably makes no sense so I'm sorry for that (again, my head isn't working the way it used to) It's just like everything is a little foggy ALL THE TIME. There's like a road block every time I try to remember something. I KNOW I know it. I know it's there. But for the life of me I just can't seem to find it. It's like somewhere there just isn't a gear connecting the way it should be. It's so frustrating. It's one of the hardest parts for me of getting clean. I know I'm no where near where I used to be intellectually. Whether other people can see it or not. I know my cognition level is drastically different from where it used to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I need to check in. I'm really having a hard time loving recovery. I read all of your posts and comments here and you all seem so positive and have all these great things to say about being clean. But for some reason... I just can't seem to find that for me yet. I'm on day 11 clean after off and on use for about 5 months after starting to try to get myself to quit. I don't have any major physical w/ds or anything like that. But damn. I just really fucking hate this. I know that attitude is probably why I keep fucking up and using again. But I just am really, really struggling to find the good in this. I lost the majority of my friends when I first started trying to quit. I could probably reconnect with most of them. But I KNOW if I hang out with them I'll be using. Whether or not they offer it, with where I'm at mentally if I put myself in that situation I'll ask around if anyone has anything. There is no way I'll stay clean if I'm with them. But I'm just so damn lonely and bored. All I do is work. Which isn't bad because I need the money. Badly. But I just go to work and get bitched at all day. It would be super awesome to be able to go relax with friends after. Logically, I know that it wasn't, but it just seems like life was so much better when I was using and not giving a fuck. Things are kind of shitty right now. I'm trying to deal with an asshole who won't leave me alone and figure out what to do there. My grandma (well she isn't technically my grandma. I didn't know any of my grandparents died before I was born. For all intents and purposes, she's my grandma) had a stroke and is in the hospital. I'm just overwhelmed and worn out and stressed and.. I don't even know what. I feel like I'd kill to go get high right now. It's not like it would be hard to make a call and get something... but I'm trying not to. Sorry. I didn't mean to be so negative. I'm just waiting for the "it gets better" and it doesn't seem to be happening. </TEXT>
