	<TEXT> I don't know if drawing the conclusion that popularity is based on how much of a particular series one has watch is a good indicator. You have neither demographic info, what if everyone that is on this reddit was around when tng waa airing but none had seen tos. However if everyone that responded was born in the timeframe of nu-trek and the results were as they were then you might have serious insight.

All you have is a data point that says tng era trek was most watched. When tng came out there was fewer quality sci-fi on tv than when the later series came out. So that can highly skew the numbers as just one example. </TEXT>
