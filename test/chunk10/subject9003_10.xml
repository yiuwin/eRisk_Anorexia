	<TEXT> While a lot of us here might agree with you, we should also remember that we are the fanboys and girls. A lot of the problems that pitchfork pointed out have some truth to them. I can cherry pick a lot of great things out of the album but at the end of the day, there is something to be said about the albums nature. I think that there are too many features (and I know Magnus didn't have much of a choice). It does not sound like the Cashmere Cat that I like listening to.


I enjoyed the album but I respect what Pitchfork had to say. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the Altra bandwagon, I've added the Superiors to my collection. Out of the box, the shoe was grippy but has seem to lose some of that now. After a hundred or so miles, the lugs are coming off. Altras are hardly the most durable shoes but I still love them.

On the positive sides, the shoe fits and feels great on my foot. The shoe is surprisingly soft for its stack height but it is supple enough that you can feel the ground beneath sole. This shoe will be my go to shoe for racing, intervals, and long runs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all,

I'm about five weeks out from my first 50k ever and I'm a little clueless on the nutrition side of things. What do you guys do race day? There's about 5,000 of climbing and I'm hoping to finish around the 4'30" mark. On my long runs, which are anywhere from 20-22 miles long with 3,000 to 5,000 of vert, I will carry two 20fl oz bottles of water and maybe two gels. That can get me through the run but I'm always pretty wrecked afterwards.

Also, how do you taper for a 50k? I've only raced trail half marathons and I have always done a two week taper. I've been doing about 80mpw with one week over a 100mpw. I'm hoping to hit 100mpw again but with more vert for peak week. Should I do that this week or next week? Race day is June 3.
 
Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read Foucault in a couple of my philosophy classes and in a couple of my sociology classes. The philosophy courses did a better job framing his work historically and theoretically. I read Foucault with two different sociology professors, one was more of a Marx-Feminist and the other was an anarcho-capatalist. They both picked works of Foucault that could affirm their theoretical preferences. 
Foucault, like most prominent thinkers, had a lot to say and it was good to get an idea of his scope as an undergrad. If I were to read him in the future, I would now know where to start and how to read him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much. Refer to props 109 and 126 of PI he writes that we resolve philosophical problems by rearranging what is before us, not deducing the answers from propositions, and "Philosophy simply puts everything before us, and neither explains nor deduces anything".

Or here... I'll just link prop. 109 because it's too late for me to be doing any mental work.

 "109. It was true to say that our considerations could not be scientific
ones. It was not of any possible interest to us to find out empirically
'that, contrary to our preconceived ideas, it is possible to think suchand-such'whatever
that may mean. (The conception of thought as a
gaseous medium.) And we may not advance any kind of theory. There
must not be anything hypothetical in our considerations. We must do
away with all explanation, and description alone must take its place.
And this description gets its light, that is to say its purpose, from
the philosophical problems. These are, of course, not empirical
problems; they are solved, rather, by looking into the workings of our
language, and that in such a way as to make us recognize those workings:
in despite of an urge to misunderstand them. The problems are
solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging what we
have always known. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment
of our intelligence by means of language." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This

The biggest difference between the TLP and PI is Wittgenstein's metaphysics. There are some things that Wittgenstein is consistent about throughout his career. In *Logik*, a notebook that he completed when living in a hut in Norway in 1913, he form a conception of philosophy that he goes to his grave with. Here's a quick list:

*Philosophy is purely descriptive. This appears in props. 109 and 126 of PI and all throughout TLP.

*Language gives no pictures of reality. This appears in prop. 6.432 of TLP and props. 420-428 (think private language)

*Philosophy is not a natural science. Prop. 4.11 of TLP, p. 18-19 of the Blue book, and prop. 109 of PI. For Wittgenstein, philosophy is descriptive and science is explanatory.

*"Philosophy consists of logic and metaphysics, the former its basis." Props. 6.53 and 6.111 of TLP and page 35 of the Blue Book.

I do not know how useful this info is but I think the continuity of Wittgenstein's thought is fascinating. I have written a couple of papers on the subject and would write more if I was not so lazy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> High school track is open to the public

Also, join the Durango running company and go for a run with them. They have runs for all ability levels. 

Try other parts of the river trail. The section from the high school to the surgical hospital is mostly flat. If you go around the college clockwise, it will feel like it is mostly flat and downhill.

There aren't a whole lot of pancake flat spots in Durango. We do live in a mountain valley after all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The density and sugar content of syrup is the same between grades. 

 Though all grades of pure maple syrup are identical in density and maple sugar content (66.9%), the color of the syrup can and does range from pale golden to dark brown. In fact, maple syrup is graded solely by its color. This difference in color has mostly to do with when the syrup is made. As the spring warms up, the sap coming from the trees becomes darker in color, producing a darker syrup. Corresponding to color, the darker the syrup is, the stronger its flavor. The State of Vermont distinguishes four maple syrup grades. From light to dark they are: Fancy, Grade A Medium Amber, Grade A Dark Amber, and Grade B. It is important to understand that ALL maple syrup is produced by exactly the same process.

	<TEXT> Grades of maple syrup do not differentiate quality, they differentiate color. Darker colored syrups are B and C. They are produced in the warmer months and have stronger flavor.

	<TEXT> I quit smoking and bought a bike in September of 2014. I rode 68 hours that year. In 2015, I did 160 hours on the bike and ran 100 hours. So far this year, I'm at 212 hours for biking and 140 hours for running.

This summer I consistently did 15 hour weeks with one 4-5 hour ride. I usually ride by feel and rarely do structured workouts on the bike. Usually I like to do 60% moderate/easy, 20% tempo, and 20% threshold or vo2. Running is always 4 days easy, one threshold hill run, and a hard long run. </TEXT>
