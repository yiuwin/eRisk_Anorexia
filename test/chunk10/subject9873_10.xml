	<TEXT> So I tried to contact Elektra Records (the record label that Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers were signed to at the time Believe in Yourself was released) and I couldn't find their email, I couldn't DM them on Twitter, and I couldn't tweet to them because my tweet was too long. It seems unless they get leaked somehow nobody will ever realistically have access to these stems. :\ </TEXT>
