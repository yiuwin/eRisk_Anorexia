	<TEXT> I think the Civil War is undeniably bad. In addition to dodecimating (new word?) our male population, it destroyed the wealthy South and left it our poorest region. The barbarous actions of Sherman gave us the staggering poverty you see in the South today, and the civil war undeniably contributed to the arrogant Northern chauvinism that disparages Southerners as hicks and Southern pride as racist.

Furthermore, thanks to chicanery and fraud, the Republicans held the White House for 6 straight elections, creating a single party state post-civil war. Along with Lincoln acting like a dictator, the Republican Party's actions from 1860-1896 leave a bad taste in my mouth. 

Additionally, the Civil War didn't end slavery: the 13th Amendment did. And even then, it did little to improve the lives of many blacks, who were still de facto enslaved via sharecropping. In 1872, Republicans won the election because Republican-dominated Reconstruction governments, black voters, and many former Confederates not being allowed to vote gave them the South, and thus the election, even while losing the white vote nationally. In 1877, they agreed to remove the military from the South in return for Democrats recognizing Hayes' victory, which gave the South almost entirely over to Democrats, thus dooming black citizens for the sake of Hayes' election. (I have nothing against Hayes, by the way, he is my favorite president.) The first black senator was from Mississippi, in the 1870s; the next black senator wasn't ected until the 1960s in Massachusetts.

. By the next decade, Republicans were able to recoup their losses in the South via the Western states, so they stopped trying to help the blacks in Southern states. Neither the supposed abolitionists nor the Democrats cared that much about blacks; most abolitionists merely opposed the power amassed by slaveholders.

It wasn't until 1965 that things really improved for the vast majority of blacks. I would have preferred legal slavery to have continued for a few decades before being peacefully extinguished than to have "ended slavery" in a half-assed manner which did not at all help most blacks. </TEXT>

Ah, I see. So you can point out the flaws you observe in your Christian brethren (even the Pope!) but when members of the Clinton campaign do it it's a huge problem?

There's a difference between "pointing out flaws" in people's Christianity and pointing to people's Christianity as a flaw.

	<TEXT> I meant to say that I don't believe that the ends always justify the means, not that they never do.

You support widespread theft of every citizen in the United States. Yet you don't support theft of one citizen? 

Being critical of certain Catholics they view as false or hypocritical is not the same thing as being critical of all Catholics or of all converts.

They were criticizing them for actually believing in the Catechism.

I repeat again that the folks you're quoting are Catholics themselves.

I don't think the people I'm quoting are religious at all, but if they're criticizing the Catechism, they're not Catholics at all and should be excommunicated.

So did you not read the link I provided or do you just not believe it?

I don't believe Hillary Clinton really believes in Christianity. I don't think most politicians do.

Ah yes, the No True Scotsman fallacy

You're essentially saying that anyone who claims to be Christian can be called Christian. If Christianity stands for everything, it stands for nothing - and people who directly contravene the scripture are not Christians.

I'd imagine the Pope would say anyone who opposes accepting Syrian refugees isn't a true Christian. He also also accepts the science on climate change, calling humanity's role in it "a sin against God."

I don't really care what the Pope says, though. This is the same bright guy who's said that "There is no such thing as Muslim terrorism".

And why didn't divorce or adultery make your list?

Because nobody is a "proud divorcee" or "proud adulterer". We aren't asked to give our tax money to finance divorce and adultery by supposed Christians. We aren't told divorce and adultery are things we should accept and we're bigoted if we don't. 

Nobody ever claims divorce and adultery are good things. Even Bill Clinton never said that, of all people.

many of your "Christian" brothers and sisters embrace the label only as far as it conveniences them.

No shit - that's kind of my point...

I think you're refuse to answer because you know the answer is Clinton.

I didn't refuse to answer... my answer was neither. I don't think Donald Trump is a Christian, and I don't think Hillary Clinton is a Christian either. 

Donald Trump is an adulterous, greedy, lustful piece of filth. He only claims to be Christian to pander, and I wish he would be honest about being irreligious.

Hillary Clinton is a congenital liar, supports the murder of babies, gay "marriage", and forcing churches to hold them; her husband is a serial filanderer and she stood by him for the sake of power. 

Neither one is really a believing Christian, and I'm not sure why you assume everyone who's against you is pro-Trump. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol. Yes, I support the concept of taxation, as does pretty much everyone in existence. What a radical I am!

I think you missed my point. You support massive, widespread theft (taxation) because it leads to better outcomes, in your opinion. Thus, you are, absolutely, an "ends justify the means" guy.

No, these are bastardized, twisted, Russian approved versions of what they wrote

I challenge you to back them up with direct quotes.

Sure thing. Here's a quote from Halpin mocking Rupert Murdoch for raising his children Catholic:

Its an amazing bastardization of the faith. They must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of Christian democracy,

He apparently believes that believing in the fucking catechism is "a bastardization of the faith". Palmieri responded:

"I imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion. Their rich friends wouldnt understand if they become evangelicals,"

That's the quote I was talking about. How disgusting. And Halpin's response:

 They can throw around Thomistic thought and subsidiarity and sound sophisticated because no one knows what the hell theyre talking about.

I guess it's no surprise Hillary's supporters know nothing about Catholic thought, huh? 

They weren't edited at all, despite your claims to the contrary. Even Hillary's supporters never said any such thing.

I highly doubt you've put any real thought into that stance.

Hillary Clinton claims to be Christian for the same reason most Democrats do: non-religious people will have a hard time getting elected. Anyone who supports gay marriage, abortion, and transgenderism - and especially those who insult Christians for following the Bible - cannot really be said to be Christians. 

EDIT: Out of curiosity, which of Trump and Clinton do you think is the more genuine Christian?

Neither. </TEXT>

Translation: "I can't actually debate you, so I will only tackle your weakest points."

I don't even know what you're referring to.

Taxation.

The Clinton campaign did not hold Christianity in contempt.

They talked openly about infiltrating the Catholic Church to make it more progressive, and referred to Catholics who actually believe in the catechism in very demeaning ways. For example, one of them said that Catholic converts were just "homophobes and misogynists with stone-age beliefs, but couldn't be evangelical because it's not fashionable".

Clinton herself and much of her staff were Christians!

Really? But he's a private individual, isn't he? And surely the leakers have some ulterior motive, no? You seem to be going against your own logic here.

I define institution the same way as anyone else.

Not really. I don't consider the DNC or the RNC or anything else an "institution" of our Republic.

Our elections are supposed to be free of clandestine, foreign influence. Is it really so hard for you to understand that?

The "influence" was "revealing the truth". If Canada had leaked Donald Trump's tax returns, you would not give a shit. 

I'm not an "ends justify the means" type

Oh, I seriously doubt that. You support theft on a massive scale because it leads to better outcomes. You certainly do believe ends SOMETIMES justify the means.

In this particular scenario their actions were illegal

So were Ed Snowden's actions... If you justify morality by legality, you're going to have a rough time.

and not helpful in making a sound decision.

Hahahahah what the fuck? These emails revealed a lot about the Clinton campaign, especially (for me) their contempt for Christianity. 

They were in this instance,

They were "partisan" in the sense that they hurt the candidate more likely to go to war with them...

Nope. It's not a hot topic at the moment.

So you only ever talk about things that are hot topics? You sound like a dull person.

The question is phrased so generally as to be practically meaningless. I support fracking in some cases and I don't in others.

That sounds like a copout way of saying "I don't understand the issue" </TEXT>

Then shouldn't you be mad about the leaks about Donald Trump, most of which are blatantly false? Presidential candidates are public figures.

The DNC.

The DNC is one of our institutions? What the hell does "institution" mean to you? It's part of a private political organization...

When the "more information" is illegally acquired by a geopolitical for and then manipulated for the purpose of influencing the electorate, then it's a bad thing for what should be obvious reasons.

You keep saying "obvious reasons" etc etc, but it's just not clear what those reasons are. Russia realized that Hillary Clinton is corrupt, and they revealed that to the American people. Should we be mad about Russia acting in their own best interest when it's also helpful to us in making sound decisions?

Snowden is not obviously partisan

Top fucking kek. And Russia is partisan?

I like how, instead of actually arguing, you're just insulting. Shows the liberal mindset.

Then you have absolutely no right to be upset when someone describes you as dense.

I can tell you're a liberal because you resort to insults right off the bat.

That's how we wound up with stories like "Clinton hates Catholics" or "Clinton practices bizarre occult ritual" or all the Pizzagate nonsense.

Actually, those came directly from the emails and were real things, which you're mischaracterizing. Pizzagate definitely didn't come from the Russians.

You know what *did* come from the Russians? Anti-fracking propaganda to protect Gazprom. Unlike the email leaks, that propaganda was false. And governments have taken actual action based on that false info, like my state banning fracking. Why aren't you angry about that?

Now, while the actual emails that were released all appear to have been legitimate,

Indeed. And I don't care what the source is; the truth does not fear investigation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From Carlyle onwards, but especially in the last generation, the British intelligentsia have tended to take their ideas from Europe and have been infected by habits of thought that derive ultimately from Machiavelli.  All the cults that have been fashionable in the last dozen years, Communism, Fascism, and pacifism, are in the last analysis forms of power worship.

Yep, he was totally speaking about Stalinism, not communism. You know so much better than Orwell did!

it makes any sense whatsoever to say that at a socialist hates communistm, you are painfully ignorant.

Do you actually understand the differences between variants of socialism? Orwell was a democratic socialist. He believed in a *democratic government* wherein socialism would be achieved.

He hated communism and communists. You see, communism is different, because communists believe in an authoritarian "dictatorship of the proletariat" which would eventually "wither away" into a stateless society.

If you don't understand the differences between the two things, you are "painfully ignorant", to use your own words.

Yes Orwell was definitely anti-Stalinist, that's a far cry from hating all communists.

Read *Homage to Catalonia*. He had some very harsh words for the communists, who betrayed the anarcho-syndicalists and doomed the cause of socialism in Spain. He hated communists as idiots, totalitarians and hero-worshippers.

You remind me a lot of the way I was when I was 13: An arrogant leftist who calls other people idiots without actually bothering to read or understand the topic in question. 

My friend, you have no fucking idea what you're talking about. You don't understand the differences between socialism and communism. You have never read an Orwell book, unless you read Animal Farm in school because it was required reading. You are an embarrassment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> horrific slave trade

Who sold us African slaves?

Horrific systems such as Leopold in Congo

Leopold was forced to give up command of the Congo because he was a shitty ruler. After that, the Congo became the best place in Africa. Infant mortality was lower there than in some places in Italy. More blacks were in school there than in France.

You than established colonial political states for European advantage ignoring the viability or long term stability of those states.

Their long-term stability and viability were fine. They only collapsed after we left.

When the local population objected or asked you to leave,

Asking us to leave with bombs and guns.

 you would suppress them or make war against the very people you were "benevolent" too such as the Mau Mau.

Yes, we would fight back. They could not rule themselves.

By the 1940s, Germans basically tried to implement what other Europeans did in Africa (and the rest of the world) in Eastern Europe. The first concentration camps were deployed in South Africa by the British.

This is just laughable. The Holocaust never occurred in Africa. You're literally just making this shit up.

you cannot kick over a hut; build a house on top of it; burn the house down when you're evicted; and claim that the people living there don't know how to keep up or build a house.

We didn't "burn the house down when we were evicted". We left them with modern technology, modern education systems, modern forms of government, and modern infrastructure. They burnt it down because they cannot rule themselves.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, immigration is what built modern Europe, from the ground up, after their wars.

Actually, Europeans built modern Europe. After WW2, it was the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe. Large-scale immigration into Europe didn't begin until the 50s and 60s during the era of decolonization.

Its what allows the West to maintain tech/developmental edges on the rest of the world (due to the qualified/educated from the developing world being allowed to immigrate West, and subsidize various high-level fields).

That's exactly why it's bad for the rest of the world. We take in the best people from other countries and allow those countries to wallow in their own filth.

Immigration is also what allows people born in shit circumstances to have a chance at a better life. 

For most of us, hard work is what allows people born in shitty circumstances of have a better life. People should work to improve their own communities and countries, not move to others. They're dooming everyone in their community to the same life they had - but they're taking up a precious slot in another country.

To provide for loved ones back home (where opportunities aren't available), or escape overt persecution.

Both things that they could do in their own countries, without making life worse for people here.

 It has its drawbacks (increase in crime/poverty from low-skilled immigrants, brain-drain in developing countries from the high-skilled people leaving), but on balance, I'd say its a positive development.

It's a positive development for the immigrants and for large businesses. For everyone else, in both countries, it's negative.

As someone who's lived in both mono-ethnic/national areas, as well as ethnically diverse areas, I find the latter a much better/fun experience. 

Getting hammered and doing heroin is a fun experience. Doesn't mean you should do it. Policy should be based on what's prudent and good, not what is *fun*.

Furthermore, in our modern world, most areas aren't deeply steeped in tradition enough for their culture to be enjoyable.

The former is boring//lame (like Squidward in his gated community where everyone's like him, and he realizes its not that great).

What kind of fucking child are you? Comparing real life to *Spongebob*?
