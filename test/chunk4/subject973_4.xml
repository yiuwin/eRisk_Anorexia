	<TEXT> Redskins fan here, this is absolutely true. He's without a doubt our number one target, but odds are he'll get hurt again so be wary. I think his ADP should be a little lower, but he's a top talent. If he goes down with an injury though we also have Niles Paul who is a very similar player (converted to TE, was a WR) and he'll probably get a decent amount of targets if Reed were to go down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Redskins fan here,
We're going to be throwing the ball a lot this year, I mean look at our running backs. We have one of the best TE's in the league, a down field threat (Jackson), and a big possession receiver (Garcon). Our defense isn't great this season, however they'll be decent enough to get a stop often enough. Our games will likely be shootouts so I would definitely consider picking him. He can put up big numbers with the passing game we have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few points

-I just think it's crazy how much Ozil changes the game when he's in. We play so much better with him.

-Xhaka is vital for our team. Those long balls are insane. The only way he can play effectively is with someone that plays more attacking than him (Ramsey, Cazorla, Wilshere). Coq should only serve as a backup to him in my opinion.

-Although Holding made a few mistakes, I thought he played well. His passing is pretty good and he seems very composed on the ball. That corner where him and Bellerin went for the same ball and flicked it on to Ighalo was atrocious, but I thought he seemed very mature for his age.

-Walcott was great yesterday. Quiet, but great. That cross to Alexis was fantastic and he did a great job using the space he was given. Him and Bellerin are our best combo on the right.

-Alexis drifts over to the left when he plays striker a lot, he was basically playing Ox's position. Ox was kind of obsolete this whole game, plus he was not tracking back at all. Not sure where he'll fit into the team.

	<TEXT> Yes I loved how much he was tracking back, he was helping out Hector so much. Ox on the other hand didn't track back at all leaving Monreal to take on Amrabat alone. And since Amrabat is much faster than Monreal, so many chances were created from that wing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I'd like to happen:
We win the group easily and draw Benfica in the round of 16. We beat them 4-1 on aggregate and then draw City, and absolutely smash them. Then we draw Bayern and get two massive away goals, but we lose the away fixture 2-3. We play a tough home match and Giroud scores a late header to put us through. Then we get Barcelona in the final and we win 3-0 through an Oli G hattrick with Mesut assisting all goals.

What will actually happen:
We'll lose both games to PSG and it will come down to the last fixture against Basel, where we will scrape out a 2-1 victory to place second. We draw Juve in the round of 16 and lose the home fixture 1-3 but win away 2-0, however Juve go through on away goals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I mean there were better options if he had completed this earlier, as well as the fact that if we had these signings before the beginning of the season we could have 6 points right now instead of 1. However, better late than never. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure how much playing time he will get at the beginning of the season, but chances are either Jackson or Garcon will get injured at some point and then he'll step up. As a Redskins fan I'm extremely excited about him, he's got so much potential.  </TEXT>
