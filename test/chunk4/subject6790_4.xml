	<TEXT> For me she represented someone who could kick ass, and look good while doing it.
It was breathtaking watching her in Star Wars, and then all these years with her acting, her writing, and her biting wit.
We are very worse without her.  I feel super bad for those that knew her personally, and especially for her family.
No parent should outlive their child.
She truly was Hollywood royalty.  A bit more of my childhood died this week. </TEXT>

All levels of government should be properly funding transit.  Period.

	<TEXT> I sent an email to all three levels of government, and was incredibly disappointed by the response by the Federal one.  The email was asking for PROPER funding to bring us up to the rest of the world basically.  We're so comically underfunded it's ridiculous.  Here's her response:

"Thank you for reaching out. I appreciate that you took the time to write to me concerning funding for the TTC.

                                                                                                  

As you may know, our budget which was tabled in March allocated $3.4 billion to public transit over 3 years. Almost $1.5 billion of this will go to Ontario which is the largest investment in public transit by the federal government to date. In fact, the Prime Minister was at Greenwood Yard earlier this year to announce that the federal government would invest $840 million in the TTC.

 

While the federal government is a committed partner to provincial and municipal governments, we are not the decision makers in regard to operations or the provision of services.

 

 

Yours truly,

Julie" </TEXT>
