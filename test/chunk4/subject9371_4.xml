	<TEXT>  mutual love of ABBA

Let's be careful, here.  My grandfather loved ABBA; I listened to their "Greatest Hits" album extensively in my own youth; currently I don't remember much about them at all beyond the fact that they wrote a trivial and appalling song about one of the greatest and most gorgeous battles in the history of the world, and that I subsequently brought shame to the entire universe by taking clips from the 1970 Bondarchuk film about that battle and creating a music video with this song in the 10th grade.

TL;DR: Atonement, of a sort. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I stand by my reading, and condemn wholeheartedly any view of history that characterizes an event as inevitable. 

In retrospect it may indeed look almost like a *fait accompli*, but at the time it was scarcely the case.  So many things about their performance were unexpected and unprecedented, from their language choice to their choreography to their costuming to the song itself (which was a last-minute substitution for "Hasta Maana", and which was not even called "Waterloo" originally).  Gigliola Cinquetti's "Si" had proven a controversial favourite on the international stage, and Olivia Newton John's "Long Live Love" was also a favourite to win in spite of its singer's low opinion of it.  That ABBA managed to win with a song that had enjoyed such a fraught production history is a surprise, but not an unhappy one.

I furthermore insist that the song's win at the Eurovision contest bears only the most minimal resemblance to the political landscape surrounding Napoleon's war with the Seventh Coalition and the tumultuous "restoration" of the House of Bourbon, and I note with particular emphasis that no contestant representing France even competed in 1974. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Against "Waterloo" --or-- First Blast of the Trumpet Against Four Fraudulent Swedes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-16 04:30:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In 1974, a rising pop group from Sweden stunned the world by [winning the Eurovision Song Contest with a bouncy love ballad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FsVeMz1F5c) that improbably took the Emperor Napoleon's 1815 defeat at Waterloo as its pretext.  ABBA (as they were called) were largely unknown in the English-speaking world in spite of a strong showing at the previous year's Eurovision competition, but the surprise victory of "Waterloo" -- one of the first songs at the competition to be sung in English instead of in its creators' native tongue -- helped cement the band's status as one of the premier pop/disco groups in the world.  The album of the same name had been released the previous month (March of 1974), and quickly climbed the charts.

But what are we to make of ABBA's "Waterloo" as a piece of historiography?

First, let's take a look at the lyrics:

     My my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
     Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

     The history book on the shelf
     Is always repeating itself

     Waterloo
     I was defeated, you won the war
     Waterloo
     Promise to love you forever more

     Waterloo
     Couldn't escape if I wanted to
     Waterloo
     Knowing my fate is to be with you
     Waterloo
     Finally facing my Waterloo

     My my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
     Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
     And how could I ever refuse?
     I feel like I win when I lose

     Waterloo
     I was defeated, you won the war
     Waterloo
     Promise you'll love me forever more

     Waterloo
     Couldn't escape if I wanted to
     Waterloo
     Knowing my fate is to be with you
     Waterloo
     Finally facing my Waterloo

     So how could I ever refuse?
     I feel like I win when I lose

     Waterloo
     Couldn't escape if I wanted to
     Waterloo
     Knowing my fate is to be with you
     Waterloo
     Finally facing my Waterloo

     Waterloo
     Knowing my fate is to be with you
     Waterloo
     Finally facing my Waterloo

While the song manages to achieve a certain blamelessness by skirting around historical detail, there's enough in here to cause any BadHistorian to reach for the bottle.  Let's consider some of the highlights:

     My my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender

Dear God, **no**.  Napoleon himself did not surrender at all at the Battle of Waterloo.  On the heels of his Hundred Days' reign in Paris after his audacious coup over the army at Grenoble, Napoleon still nursed the faint hope of consolidating the forces that remained to him after the events of 18 June.  He only fled the field after the collapse of his line and the encirclement of the Old Guard, himself having remained until dusk commanding the square nearest his headquarters at the Inn of Belle-Alliance.  15,000 of his men had left the field of Waterloo alive and at liberty, and a further 33,000 under General Grouchy were still at large -- and had indeed won a victory over the Prussians at Wavre that very afternoon, pursuant to the Emperor's orders.  In spite of Napoleon's immense frustration that the letter countermanding those orders and ordering Grouchy's army to Waterloo had seemingly never reached him (it would not do so until around 10PM, hours after Napoleon had already withdrawn), there was still hope that this army might reform in defense of Paris and Napoleon himself raise new levies to continue the fight against the Coalition.

Napoleon's actual surrender would happen in several stages; he formally abdicated in favour of his son on 22 June, fled Paris on 24 June, and finally turned himself over to the custody of Captain Frederick Maitland of HMS *Bellerophon* at Rochefort on 15 July.

In any event, this is all a very far cry from the blasphemous lie attested by the song's opening words.

     Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

This erroneously views history in a deterministic sense, as though events must unfold in a certain way and "destinies" may be achieved rather than ridiculed squarely for the fantasies they are.  We must also pause to consider the unlikelihood that the events described above could in any way meaningfully approximate the experiences of someone deciding to date someone else.  It's certainly true that on the night an ex-girlfriend and I had our first date I was constantly checking my texts to see if the 30,000 men I had sent out under my roommate's command to harry the Prussians would return in time to let me call the date off early, but there any similarities must end as they began.

     The history book on the shelf
     Is always repeating itself

That history repeats itself is as much an empty platitude as that it is written by a coalition of conspirators led by Victor Hugo, Victor Garber, and Victor Emmanuel II of Italy.

     Waterloo
     I was defeated, you won the war

Again, this is very far from being strictly accurate.  Napoleon himself was not defeated, and neither were his forces *in toto*.  Nearly 50,000 men escaped destruction or capture at the hands of the Coalition, and it was not until Napoleon's return to Paris that he discovered that both the populace and the civil government had turned against him.  Even at that, the final battle of the war would not even be fought until 3 July -- many days after the Emperor had actually abdicated, though still before he had formally turned himself over to the English.

     Waterloo
     Couldn't escape if I wanted to

This is also a flagrant lie.  Napoleon did indeed escape in good order (though his carriage eventually had to be abandoned, and was captured by Coalition forces with many of his documents and valuables still in it) and returned to Paris.  From there his escape continued, taking him to the coast of France.  There are apocryphal reports that he had intended to board a sympathetic ship and make his way to the Americas, but mounting concerns over his official "outlaw" status (declared at the Congress of Vienna in March of 1815) and the dead-or-alive price placed upon his head by the Prussians saw him instead surrender to Captain Maitland on the assurance of safe conduct to England, where he hoped (not without reason) to receive a sentence of permanent house arrest.  This did not end up happening, of course, and he was instead exiled to St. Helena -- but even then it must be asked whether or not he would have been able to escape from there if he had desired to.  He had escaped Elba without any great difficulty, but that was when chaos reigned and hope remained.  We will never known what he might have done from St. Helena if only he had willed it so.

     Waterloo
     Finally facing my Waterloo

More of the deterministic view, as though Waterloo and its consequences were something that sat inexorably in the path of Napoleon's life.  Any number of things -- down to the mute and mindless alteration of the weather -- might have shifted the battle in his favour, so treating it as though it was fated seems insane.  

     My my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger

Debatable.  Napoleon's Old Guard remained more or less intact, and constituted some of the finest infantry in Europe.  Blcher's arrival was fortuitous but not pre-ordained, and on his own he and his men could not have been decisive.  Grouchy's absence was pivotal, certainly, but should we really consider the Coalition "stronger" when it achieved this strength only by the absurd and unfortunate absence of two-fifths of the opposing force?  In any case, "strength" is always a relative thing.  The Royal Scots Greys were derisively known (by the French, at least), as the "noblest cavalry in Europe -- and the worst led."  What consequences would that have?  The French light cavalry charged at an opportune time but did not withdraw as it should have, instead facing the catastrophe of sprawling over a sunken road and being decimated (or I guess more than decimated) by massed British infantry squares.  Was the cavalry really not "stronger"?  Were the infantry "stronger" just because of how they were standing?  An endless debate. 

     Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

Fair enough, I suppose; the only way the Emperor could have consolidated his remaining troops was indeed by withdrawing, and so he did.

     And how could I ever refuse?
     I feel like I win when I lose

I don't even begin to know what this means.  At no point during any of the events occurring between 18 June and 15 July did the Emperor "feel like he had won."  We have evidence that he conducted his affairs in a sense of hope, but his actions during this period show that he was more than aware of the realities facing him.  As for how he could ever refuse?  Well -- twenty years spent at war and creating a nation and a legal code that redefined civil, economic, and military life in Europe.  Twenty years spent shaping a continent to his will, treating with duplicitous and skeptical enemies, conducting diplomacy across half the earth in dozens of languages, reforming a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, engaging in dozens of intrigues and affairs, inspiring and hating a people in equal measure, kidnapping pontiffs and emancipating Jews and flirting with Islam, bringing his nation to its greatest glory AND its greatest defeat, attempting to embody an entire Revolution in the person of one unhappy man -- I say again, **well**.  How could he ***but*** refuse?

**TL;DR:** A song being catchy is no guarantee that it is also accurate as a piece of historiography. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been surprised by the degree to which certain books have become near-universal touchstones for students coming out of high school, even in different countries.  There are few who have not been forced to read Orwell's *Animal Farm*, Shakespeare's *Romeo   Juliet*, or Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*.  For many people who later abandon reading as a source of pleasure, in fact, these stand a fair chance of being the only books they've ever really encountered in a serious way.

I'm curious, though: how would **you** sculpt a reading list for Grade 9, 10, 11 and 12 English that **doesn't include the following:**

- Harper Lee - *To Kill a Mockingbird*
- George Orwell - *Animal Farm*
- George Orwell - *1984*
- William Golding - *The Lord of the Flies*
- Aldous Huxley - *Brave New World*
- William Shakespeare - *Romeo   Juliet*
- William Shakespeare - *Hamlet*
- William Shakespeare - *MacBeth*
- Margaret Atwood - *A Handmaid's Tale*
- F. Scott Fitzgerald - *The Great Gatsby*
- Arthur Miller - *Death of a Salesman*
- John Steinbeck - *Of Mice and Men*
- Ray Bradbury - *Fahrenheit 451*
- Mark Twain - *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*
- J.D. Salinger - *The Catcher in the Rye*
- Anne Frank - *The Diary of a Young Girl*
- Lois Lowry - *The Giver*
- Nathaniel Hawthorne - *The Scarlet Letter*

Anything else is fair game.  I'd be interested in seeing your lists, and even more interested in hearing your reasons.  Let's assume at least three novels and one play per year, though I'm sure there would be more or less depending on how a given teacher approached the matter or what certain school boards mandated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just wanted to offer a quick note declaring that I really liked the various ways in which you've explained your key concepts in this comment, "absolute brutality" be damned.  It is very often forgotten that the firepower once available only to enormous groups of men and governable only by quite elevated officers became more and more accessible to smaller and more isolated groups as the various armies adapted themselves to the circumstances of the war; looking at the conduct of these armies in the trenches on the Western Front in neglect of this fact is not the most helpful thing.

I will also note, to bang my own little drum once again, that some of the (especially British) generals who are routinely criticized as imbeciles in modern discussions understood the crucial need for this sort of delegation very well indeed.  Haig, for example, placed a heavy emphasis upon leaving on-the-spot decisions to the men actually on the ground and possessing the relevant and immediate intelligence.  

One of the fatal flaws of this is how difficult it consequently became to get an entire battallion -- or sometimes an entire division, God help them -- to act properly in concert when so many decisions had to be made by leaders cut off from either the bigger or smaller picture, depending on what was most needful.  Still, I continue to be cautious in assigning all of the blame for this to the generals: if walkie-talkies (or something reliably and functionally like them) had been available in 1914, they absolutely would have used them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bairnsfather's cartoons were some of the most popular of the war, doing for the British Tommy what Bill Mauldin would do for the bedraggled American infantrymen Willie and Joe of the Second World War.  Bairnsfather's works struck a lighter note than many of his more overtly propagandistic contemporaries; unlike someone like the Dutch artist Louis Raemaekers, who sensationalized his German adversaries with every kind of slur and perversion imaginable, Bairnsfather's works focused primarily on the daily life of the indomitable and worldly-wise British infantryman in the trenches.

Still, much of the humour has a very dark quality to it, and Bairnsfather never flinched from showing the grotesque living conditions of the trenches in a far more realistic light than many more "serious" correspondents of his time.  His works remain a wonderful legacy of the war, and I'm very glad to see renewed attention being paid to him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When it comes to England, at least, there are two important components that I'd like to mention -- one a personality, and the other a law.  The following is derived largely from comments I've made elsewhere about a particularly infamous event, to which I will link below.

Anyway: The personality, to begin with, was **Sir Oswald Mosley**.  

The British Union of Fascists was founded by Mosley in 1932, and it was immediately successful. There were already a number of Fascist organisations in the British Isles to begin with, and Mosley managed to unite them under himself with the promise of turning them into a legitimate -- and, he hoped, irresistible -- political force. At its height the BUF boasted some 50,000 official members, and, though public protest against the Unions meetings and demonstrations was in constant evidence, order was kept through the deployment of increasingly well-organised (and increasingly violent) black-shirted footsoldiers. Brawls and riots became more common; public sympathy waned.

Still, the story is a familiar one; about on par, in fact, with how events played out in other nations across Europe. At first its one man forming a new and initially unsuccessful party, but soon there are uniformed men marching through your streets with their own anthem playing, people are getting hurt, and an impotent state looks on. So it was with Mussolini, so it was with Hitler, and so it was with Mosley.

The problem in his case was a multi-faceted one.

In spite of his charisma and his popularity with certain fascist demagogues, he had rather aggressively tarnished his reputation with every other major political force in England.  An aristocrat of well-established vintage and a notorious philanderer (it is said that, after his first marriage to Lord Curzon's daughter, he slept with her, her sister, her maid, and *her mother*), Mosley had filled out his early career by dabbling in quite conventional politics, spending a number of years as the Conservative MP for Harrow before crossing the floor and spending a few more as the Labour MP for Smethwick. By 1930, however, he had become disgusted with the state of the national political scene, and, resigning from the Labour Party, founded a new party of his own (imaginatively called The New Party). It failed to achieve much traction, and, disappointed, Mosley looked abroad for fresh ideas.

He found them in Italy, with results very much like you might imagine.  His return to form as a newborn fascist, after having grievously disappointed both Tory and Labour factions and having created a failure of a party, left him *persona non grata* with many of the leading papers, magazines, and social icons of the time.

As a consequence, he and the BUF came to rely more and more upon the sort of strong-arm tactics that proven so successful in Italy and Germany.  These culminated in the sensational [**Battle of Cable Street**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nkyoa/wednesday_week_in_history_oct_2_oct_8/ccjjzgs) on Oct. 4th of 1936, which saw Mosley and his black-shirted cohorts attempt to march through a region of London famously populated by immigrants, Jews, etc.  This resulted in a day-long running battle between the blackshirts and a veritable volunteer army, but there was one more far-reaching consequence that bears mentioning here.

We have considered the personality of Sir Oswald; let us consider in turn the law that his actions eventually brought about.

Both Cable Streeters and fascists were eventually dispersed and the police, in a general sense, won the day. There were arrests and injuries aplenty, and international fascism hadnt exactly been stopped for all time, but Mosley and his men had indeed been turned back, and would have to think twice before they tried something like this again. They werent afforded many more opportunities, however; as a direct result of the Battle of Cable Street, the government was moved to pass **the Public Order Act**, which came into effect on the 1st of January, 1937. While it didnt ban the BUF outright, the Act did ban the wearing of political uniforms in public, made illegal all quasi-military political organisations, and imposed stiff penalties on political marches and demonstrations undertaken without police consent. The BUF would not actually be banned until 1940, at which point Mosley, his wife, and hundreds of his supporters were arrested and interned as possible enemy sympathizers -- though, perhaps surprisingly, the real problems that the Mosleys had then been causing came in the form of too-various and too-broad calls for immediate and international peace.

The Public Order Act remained in effect from 1937, and the Second World War's outset in 1939 came at a time when any question about the suitability of fascism as a political system for England had already been decisively settled by the course of events.  In a sense, Mosley came the closest out any Englishmen to establishing a fascist order in England -- but he was also indirectly responsible for the legislation and widespread public furor that made such an establishment impossible.

**TL;DR:** The British Union of Fascists tried in earnest to bring about such a government in England, but intense public opposition and the drafting of anti-fascist legislation prevented them from succeeding. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sir Hew Strachan's single volume *The First World War* does an admirable job of covering all of the basics, but make sure you get the short one-volume one rather than *The First World War -- Vol. I: To Arms*.  The latter, in spite of having a very similar title, is the first in a projected three-part series meant to replace C.R.M.F. Cruttwell's outdated *History* that he produced for Oxford's Clarendon Press back in the 1930s.  It's 1000+ pages long and manages to be both in-depth and necessarily incomplete.  The shorter volume was compiled in the process of Strachan's work on a documentary series of the same name, and it is quite accessible.

Gary Sheffield's recent *A Short History of the First World War* (2014) is also quite good, and should be very easy to find.  Sir Michael Howard's *The First World War* (2002) may now be less immediately available, but it was designed to be a concise introduction to the subject and achieved this goal admirably. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What was so appalling about von Lettow? That campaign was handled absolutely masterfully by him.

I'm very much prepared to concede that Lettow-Vorbeck did what he did in a very competent manner, militarily.  I nevertheless remain ambivalent about the campaign as a whole.

For those who don't know, the story of the **[German General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Lettow-Vorbeck)'s** campaign in East Africa during the First World War is routinely cited as one of the most "badass" and "awesome" things to happen during the war.  He was one of very few generals of the time to have never once been defeated in battle; he kept his Allied pursuers tracking him on a fruitless wild goose chase through the sweltering jungle for just over four years, and only formally surrendered on November 25th of 1918 -- two weeks after the Armistice.  It took that long for him to get the news, and he wasn't even sure he believed it.  When he surrendered, he had to actually go find his enemies first.

Anyway, as I said, this story is often hailed for how badass and gallant and amazing it all was, but there's a very dark side to the whole campaign that is routinely ignored.  

Lettow-Vorbeck didn't do all of this on his own, naturally, and neither did the Allied armies (led for a time by the internationally famous South African General Jan Smuts); they had an absolute reliance on native African baggage porters who were used to carry each army's respective supplies around.  The Allied Carrier Corps was a voluntary wing, mostly recruiting out of neighbouring Kenya; the German porters were essentially slaves, given the choice of joining the German column or being either executed or left in the ruins of their village -- depending upon how close the enemy was at Lettow-Vorbeck's heels on a given day.  Countless men from across the reaches of Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda were pressed into service in this way, and their communities were stripped of any useful supplies or crops they had.  Many such communities were deliberately destroyed by the German column to prevent their being of any use to the pursuing Allies.  Sorry, Africans!  Better luck next time, I guess.

Over the course of the war's four years, over 300,000 soldiers (between Lettow-Vorbeck's column and his Allied pursuers) marched back and forth through this patch of jungle and scrubland.  They were assisted by the grueling and often unpaid labour of some 500,000 to 700,000 native African porters, who worked in conditions scarcely to be imagined.  Between 1914 and 1918, somewhere between 200,000 and 400,000 of these porters were literally worked to death, dying in their thousands to disease, exhaustion, accident, or even summary execution.  They also became a target for both sides, attacking the other to disrupt supply lines, and so were "destroyed" with as much zeal as rail lines or cargo ships might have been.  

In the wake of this deadly adventure lay thousands of devastated African communities, stripped bare of food, their buildings burned, their able-bodied men all gone.  Even where crops survived, there were too few to bring in the harvest.  The surrounding jungle's game had been devoured.  Corpses polluted wells and streams -- sometimes deliberately deposited to achieve a temporary advantage for one side against the other.  Disease was rampant; famine was inevitable.  In the war's aftermath, another 300,000 East African civilians would die of starvation or illness.  That's **500,000 to 700,000 dead in all**, and for a basically ridiculous reason -- Lettow-Vorbeck had been ordered by his superiors *not* to engage in this campaign, but had done so anyway out of a wholly misguided zeal.

Lettow-Vorbeck's escapade made [a great entry for a Cracked list](http://www.cracked.com/article_19534_5-soldiers-who-kicked-ass-in-face-death-and-logic.html); the hundreds of thousands of African dead didn't make it into the article, somehow.

 And in the spirit of REMOVE EUROCENTRISM, I contribute the Japanese movie "Bearded Paradise" (or Baruto no Gakuen) about German POWs in Japan during WWI.

Thank you for this!  I will try to check it out at once -- it sounds fascinating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to take any attention away from [the other FWW post](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2tf4p2/meta_reddit_posts_about_the_first_world_war_are/) that just went up, but good grief am I getting tired of this kind of thing.

From /r/Movies: **[When will someone make a modern WWI epic movie?](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2tdkbv/when_will_someone_make_a_modern_epic_wwi_movie/)**

When indeed?  It's a pity nobody ever bothered to make *Lawrence of Arabia* or the two *All Quiet on the Western Front*s or *War Horse* or *The Blue Max* or *Doctor Zhivago* or *The Monocled Mutineer* or the *Fall of Eagles* series or *Parade's End* or both film and television versions of both *Birdsong* and *Testament of Youth* or *Flyboys* or *Hell's Angels* or *Anzacs* or *Gallipoli* or *Beneath Hill 60* or *Joyeux Noel* or *The Trench* or *Wings* or *Passchendaele* or *The Lost Battalion* or *A Very Long Engagement* or who even knows.  Admittedly not all of these are modern or "epic", but many of them are at least one, if not both.  These are just off the top of my head; no doubt there are many more.

Still, let's take the complaint at its most literal and assume that modern should mean *new*.  When will someone make a new WWI epic movie?  Well, recent works like *War Horse*, *Birdsong*, *Testament of Youth* etc. aside, lots of people *are* still making them.  Russell Crowe's *The Water Diviner* should be out soon, and is getting great reviews, and there's perennial talk of a new WWI film starring Daniel Radcliffe in some capacity.  Apparently Bradley Cooper is also attached to a novel film about American efforts to disrupt German espionage in the U.S.

So, people are making them.  There are plenty of both long- and short-scope projects being produced for television, too, with the BBC having aired *Passing Bells*, *The Crimson Field*, *The Village*, *Thirty-Seven Days* and *The Wipers Times* all within the last year or so.  All of these were at least interesting; some of them were actually quite good.

All of this aside, why can't they just make more of them?  When are we going to get a good WWI movie, guys?

The answer is **never**, apparently, because it's impossible to make one.

 WWI doesn't lend itself to action movie heroics as much as WWII. As one of the first and largest industrial wars, fought over so little with such disastrous consequences, WWI lends itself much more to grand tragedy and misery than to heroism. The Normandy scene in Saving Private Ryan works because the cause is heroic. In WWI, it would be purely tragic, which is not as appealing to a wide audience.

We find in this one of the first and most frequent problems involved in how people tend to assess the war's cinematic potential: the war is only a tragedy, full stop, and so cannot be as interesting as something that was apparently more upbeat.  There is no reason at all for this to be true, but people sure do love to say it.

We also find a subsidiary and equally common problem: the equation of the First World War with the experience of the infantry on the Western Front.  No other branches of service or operational theatres need apply, everyone; if it's not the mud and futility of the trenches in France and Flanders, it's not the First World War.

 There were no Nazis or Japanese as easily digestible bad guys.

While this may be the case on a broad scale, one can find any number of acts of brutal evil or wickedness during the First World War if one is willing to look hard enough.  Can one really say that it would be impossible to accurately portray the Germans occupying Belgium in a negative light?  Or the Germans in East Africa?

Even apart from this, I can understand the problem posed by a lack of "easily digestible bad guys"; obviously movies featuring belligerents with complex motives are uniformly terrible .  It's just one of the laws of nature.

 I think the big difficulty with WW1 is its static nature. Millions died, but little in the way of movement, in terms of fronts and lines. 

This is not true in the slightest unless, again, you focus solely on the narrow strip of land running from the North Sea to the Swiss border.  The rest of the world also notably existed, and had many more things going on in it during the war -- many of them quite mobile.  My God, the untapped potential for an epic film about [the Serbian retreat of 1916](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_army%27s_retreat_through_Albania), or about Paul von Lettow Vorbeck's appalling campaign through Tanzania...

But no, nothing really happened, nobody really moved, nothing to make a movie about there.

 Jarhead is a modern equivalent of what a WW1 might look like, but look how badly that did.

Nooooooooo

 Also there is no real bad guy in WW1, except perhaps the ruling classes who dragged the continent into war for nothing more than a series of treaty violations (and a land grab in the imploding Ottoman Empire). Paths of Glory already covered that brilliantly, as well as Blackadder Goes Fourth.

 TLDR; Very little was achieved, The locations were dreary, life was miserable on both sides and no one was really the baddie.

Leaving aside the doubtful need for a TL;DR on a comment that is only a few sentences long, I have to just declare that I can't fucking stand it.

 There is nothing "epic" in WWI. It was only soldiers living and dying in mud, getting killed by artillery strikes, diseases, and really really short assaults. Like, run 10m and get killed.

 It was only soldiers living and dying in mud

 It was only

 only

Oh my god

 [Meanwhile, someone else is upset that T.E. Lawrence was white](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2tdkbv/when_will_someone_make_a_modern_epic_wwi_movie/cny9a08?context=5)

Which, I... okay.  I guess?

To conclude, here is a non-exhaustive list of First World War events and figures that it would obviously be impossible to make a movie about:

- The cruise of the *Wolf*, a powerful German raider disguised as a cargo ship that spent almost two years at sea conducting a series of pirate raids in every corner of the world.  The ship's captain fancied himself something of a knight of the ocean, and he and his crew conducted themselves with such courtesy throughout their campaign that many of the 800 prisoners they had taken by the war's end had become personal friends with them.  This, obviously, would make for a terribly dull movie.

- The Battle of Jutland (1916), which saw the British and German fleets in the North Sea meet for their first and last serious engagement.  It was an absolutely devastating battle, full of near misses, heroics, sudden turn-abouts, and the outcome always poised on the edge of a knife.  Could there possibly *be* a more boring and unlikely subject for a movie?  I can't think of one.

- On a smaller scale, the naval Battles of Coronel and the Falklands in November and December of 1914, which saw long running battles, brilliant maneuvers, sensational losses of life, unorthodox tactics, heroics, chivalry, brutality, romance -- everything that makes a story boring and not worth telling. 

- The Serbian retreat already mentioned above.

- Pursuant to that, the life of Captain Flora Sandes, the only English woman to serve as an "infantryman" in uniform during the war.  Originally a volunteer nurse working with the Serbian army, she was summarily drafted into that army as a private during the retreat to ensure that she would receive proper rations and protection.  By the war's conclusion she had reached the rank of captain, and would receive the highest Serbian honour that can be awarded to a foreigner.

- East Africa, also already mentioned.  Four years of guerrilla warfare in the sweltering jungle heat -- boring, I know, but we just have to scrape the bottom of the barrel here.

- Speaking of which, the exploits of the absurdly eccentric Geoffrey Spicer-Simson, who dragged the tiny [HMS *Mimi* and *Toutou*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Mimi_and_HMS_Toutou) through the jungle to wage a tiny war for Lake Tanganyika.  This could be one of the most uninteresting movies ever made, if only anyone would bother. 

- We are periodically reminded that there was a war happening in the air as well as on the ground and at sea.  I can think of nothing that would be less exciting to see on the screen than aerial warfare, but maybe there's some pervert out there who would enjoy it.  

- The [Siege of Kut Al Amara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Kut)!  Wake me up when it's over, *please*.

- The offensive of the last hundred days of the war, which saw all of the mobility and victory and sensational turnabout and ferocious action that we're apparently supposed to expect in a war epic.  I'm sure they'll get right on this.^1

Please list more!  I mean, if you can -- it's impossible, after all.

^1 - No they won't; the fact that the war ended with some of the most tremendous victories in the history of the British infantry (among others) is nowhere to be found in the popular memory of the war, so it's not likely that they'll be making a film about it any time soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Among other things, this would involve accepting a solemn German promise to respect Belgian rights... made specifically on the occasion that the Germans were violating a solemn promise to respect Belgian rights.

Germany tried to maintain this incredible pretense even as it was literally in the process of invading and occupying Belgium, in fact.  Field Marshal Otto von Emmich, commanding the Army of the Meuse, oversaw the assault on Lige beginning on August 5th, 1914.  Even as his artillery rained shells down on the fortress city, he ordered the [distribution of posters](https://archive.org/stream/scrapsofpaperger00malc#page/4/mode/2up) printed in French and Dutch which declared that the German army was only peaceably passing through as it raced to the southern Belgian border to thwart the dastardly French -- who had themselves allegedly violated Belgian neutrality by crossing the border in motorcars in disguise.

 The usual argument, not that it's a good one, is that British concern for Belgian neutrality was a mere pretext. I've never heard it applied to the Belgians themselves.

You're right that it's not a good one, as it isn't even the first time that this "pretext" nearly led to a continental war.  The threat posed by the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 to Belgian neutrality was so great that, on August 10th of 1870, the British Prime Minister Gladstone and his nemesis Disraeli set aside their usual mutual dislike to announce in separate speeches that their parties would support a declaration of war on any power -- Prussian OR French -- that violated Belgian neutrality at that time.  

Quoting excerpts here from *Hansard*:

Gladstone:

 What is our interest in maintaining the neutrality of Belgium? It is the same as that of every great power in Europe. It is contrary to the interests of Europe that there should be uncontrolled increase in the size of any one state. Is there any man who hears me who does not feel that if, in order to satisfy a greedy appetite for expansion, Belgium was absorbed, by no matter which power, the day that absorption took place, would hear the death knell of public right and public law in Europe?

Disraeli

 I infer from the statement of the Right Honourable Gentleman that Her Majesty's Government have taken decided steps to maintain and defend the neutrality of Belgium. I accept this as a wise and spirited policy, in my opinion, not the less wise because it is spirited.... Viewing it from a very limited point of view, it is of the highest importance to this country that the whole coast from Ostend to the North Sea should be in the hands of free and flourishing communities.

When you can get *those* two to agree on something, well...

In any event, both Prussian and French diplomats hastened to deliver assurances that no such violation of Belgian neutrality would take place, and new treaties to this effect were signed.  The events of 1914 should be considered against these facts as much as they should against that of the 1839 Treaty of London. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was at least fleetingly popular with at least one major figure, yes -- though one must naturally be cautious in taking a single example as definitive of an epoch.  

The deposed German Kaiser Wilhelm II, in exile in December of 1919, wrote to Field Marshal August Von Mackensen that he believed he had only been forced to abdicate because the German people "had been egged on and misled by the tribe of Judah."  He went on to refer to the Jewish population of Germany generally and Europe broadly as "parasites," and hoped that the German people would not rest until the Jews "have been destroyed and exterminated from German soil."  

It got worse, incredibly, as the deposed emperor called for a global pogrom against the Jews, denouncing them as "a nuisance that humanity must get rid of some way or other."  Chillingly: "I believe," he concluded, "the best thing would be gas!"

This material can be found in *Kaiser Wilhelm II: New Interpretations -- The Corfu Papers* (1982), edited by John Rohl and Nicholaus Sombart.  It should also be noted that the deposed Kaiser's relationship with the German Nazis was ambivalent and complex, and that he seems to have viewed their excesses in this direction with distaste.  He died in 1941, in any event, so we will never know what he might have thought of how things eventually turned out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've no idea if this is too slight a thing to merit inclusion in this thread, but I've always found it delightful.  Theodore Roosevelt, who would later distinguish himself as one of the foremost statesmen of his time, kept a sporadic journal in his youth.  This amazing document included his extensive impressions of the grand European tour conducted by his family when he was ten years old, and there are scores of fascinating (and often hilarious) passages in which the young ruffian finds himself confronted with the culture of the Old World.

By the time the Roosevelts reached Rome, Teedy (as he was then commonly called) had turned 11.  His time in the Eternal City was not the most exciting to him, at first:

 Dec 22d 1868, Rome: Papa made us stay in bed till 7 which is verry tiresome as we were awake at 6.  We dressed and now instead of the Roman sun the Roman rain is pouring in on the windows and from all I can see of Rome it has no pavements is verry uneven and houses are old, ugly dirty and awkward.  In fact entirely different from the romantic city I had expected.

Being stuck inside produces its own adventures, however:

 Dec 23, Rome 1869: Bamie and we stayed in in the early morning... We put up Christmas presents.  We then played.  I had the bath-tub and viel and they had two bellows and we fought.  Then they two had towels and I had bath-tub and towels and I attacked and beat them.  Read, dinner.

 Dec. 24th Rome 1869: ...Conie Ellie and I played in bed in the morning and then all except Bamie and we 3 went out.  Tomorrow is Christmas!!!! hip! hip! hurrah!!!! ... We made the trunks, sofas, chairs, and table in a row and then we two boys were donkey and with Conie on our backs we pretended we were crossing a pass.

 Then Conie went in a room and Ellie and I stuffed our pockets with pieces of bread.  We went round the house throwing bread at each other and letting it drop down stairs and laughing at evvery thing anything and nothing and then we came in one of the rooms found a lemon and went to the lardor where we got some sugar and made some lemonade.  We 2 boys drunk it with much relish.

 We then had lunch and then we 3 went out in the hall and threw some bread on another floor and then a man picked them up and looked fierce at us.  We were frightened and did not go out anymor.  We hung up Mamas stockings to a table.

Many more reminiscences of Christmas and so on continue, but I'm more interested in what happens later.  The family eventually undertakes a variety of cultural and political visits, including an audience (to Teedy quite tedious and unremarkable) with Pope Pius IX.  His encounters with this pontiff would not end there, however:

 Jan. 31st, Rome, 1870: I went to Dickeys house and then we met Ellie on the Pinchen.  We met some others and play fox and geese and bull and a kind of soildiers.  Ate ice and pelted a soildier with it.  Dinner.  Went out and played with a lot of Dickeys.  We saw the Pope and we walked along and he extended his hand to me and I kissed it!! hem!!  hem!!

I'm not sure why this chance encounter between Pontiff and future President pleases me so, but it does.  For all of his apparent sarcasm about the event, we learn from his sister's account of the meeting in her own memoirs that Teedy was actually quite polite in his run-in with Pius IX, kneeling solemnly to receive the papal blessing in spite of his own Dutch Reformed background.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One oft-cited failing of the British Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was his unimaginative neglect of the machine gun as an important weapon during the First World War.  This quote, widely attributed to him, is regularly offered in evidence of this:

 **"The machine gun is a much-overrated weapon and two per battalion would be more than sufficient."** (Usually cited as coming from Haig in 1915, but taken as definitive of his perspective as a whole)

The claim that Haig was blindly opposed to machine guns flies in the face of numerous other well-attested declarations by him from both before and after the statement above was purported to have been made.

The genesis of this claim does not lie in any of Haig's own documents, first and foremost; the **sole** attestation of it comes from the memoirs of one Christopher Baker-Carr (*From Chauffeur to Brigadier*, 1930), a major who was put in charge of the BEF's new machine gun school in November of 1914.  Baker-Carr's narrative of his early days with this academy is one of consistent frustration with the army's general staff, who apparently resisted his suggested innovations every step of the way.  John Terraine, in an amazing chapter in *The Smoke and the Fire* (1980), has pretty definitively shown that this narrative is rather unlikely in its own right, as all existing records apart from Baker-Carr's memoirs indicate that the general staff basically did everything he suggested very quickly in spite of any reservations they might have had.  I mention this not to put a slight on Baker-Carr himself, who was a remarkably interesting and accomplished person, but rather to establish that his memoirs may not be the most reliable account of all that transpired and that a great deal of personal pique seems to have made its way into them.

To give an example of this fantasticality which is essential to the quote being discussed, at some point in late December of 1914 Baker-Carr forwarded an urgent suggestion to the staff that the number of machine guns deployed among front-line battalions should be doubled.  He describes in anger having received a number of seemingly unaccommodating notes in return, including one from "an army commander" saying that "the machine-gun was a much over-rated weapon and two per battalion were more than sufficient."  We'll return to this in a few seconds, as it is the main focus of this post, but I will note first that the staff generals, contrary to Baker-Carr's unhappy declarations in his memoirs, *took his advice* and doubled the guns by February of 1915.  A mere two-month turnaround on doubling the number of guns among all front-line battalions -- at the urging of an untested officer representing a new training school -- would not seem to suggest foot-dragging or indifference on the staff's part, and this is even more apparent when manufacturing limitations are considered.  

By 1914 the Maxim was already on the way out.  Both the British and the Germans were using the heavy, outdated 1908 model, and the onset of the war inspired a flurry of redesign.  For the British this took the form of the new Vickers and Lewis guns; the former was far more reliable when it came to the problem of over-heating, and the latter was much, much more portable than any previous widely-adopted design.  The Germans stuck with the Maxims when it came to arming static gun emplacements, but also developed a portable counterpart to the Lewis, the Bergmann.

At the war's outset, the available machine guns would have been hard to widely distribute for anyone involved even if they did understand the weapon's merits.  The allocation of machine guns per infantry battalion was indeed two -- two, that is, for roughly a thousand men.  This was a matter of unhappy necessity rather than contented policy, however, as even though the War Office had placed a production order with Vickers for 196 new machine guns after the first week of the war, Vickers could only produce ten to twelve such guns per week.  It took time for the infrastructure necessary for widescale production to be developed, and it is in this context that any early-war statements on gun distribution should be considered.

First, Baker-Carr does not even explicitly say that it was Haig who said it -- only "an army commander."  Insisting that this refers to Haig requires some stretches.  The first is that he meant "army commander" in a literal rather than general sense; just prior to the war, the numerous men to whom his brief was addressed would have been referred to as corps commanders -- "army commander" was a necessary creation to accommodate the vast expansion of the army in wartime, but was still often used in lieu of "corps commander" on a casual basis in spite of it having become a formal rank.  Which would mean that, in addition to just the two formal Army Commanders (note the capitals), who were Horace Smith-Dorrien and Douglas Haig, the comment could be referring to any of the following:

- Charles Monro of I Corps
- Charles Fergusson of II Corps
- William Pulteney of III Corps
- Henry Rawlinson of IV Corps
- Herbert Plumer of V Corps
- And John French, the Commander-in-Chief

There was also Edmund Allenby of the Cavalry Corps, but it seems very unlikely that his word on the subject would have mattered enough to Baker-Carr to put him out as much as he suggests.  The comment -- assuming it is being properly ascribed -- could have come from any of them.

The reader may, at this point, reasonably ask why it couldn't have been Horace Smith-Dorrien who provided the quote above.  The main thing militating against this is that he -- like Haig, as we shall shortly see -- had been and would continue to be an enthusiastic supporter of the machine gun throughout the war; nevertheless, unlike Haig, his career was abruptly terminated in 1915 after a personal falling-out with Sir John French.  He is remembered primarily for his fortuitous decision to have II Corps turn and stand at Le Cateau during the retreat from Mons, and his subsequent nine months as a general preceded any of the parts of the war that are generally conceived of as being so catastrophically dumb.  He never had to preside over subsequent, less-flashily-satisfying campaigns (like Loos, or the Somme, or Arras, or Passchendaele), and nobody consequently found it necessary to develop lurid conspiracies about his callousness, his incompetence, his lack of imagination, his barbarity, etc. etc., into which some later claim about an ignorance of the value of a certain weapon could be so easily integrated.

Haig's own documents, by contrast, whether they be letters, dispatches or personal journals, are unequivocal in their support of machine guns as a necessary and much-desired innovation.  He took time out of his leave in January of 1898 to visit the Enfield gun works and see in both production and action the Maxim machine guns that they were then producing; his opinion of this weapon's usefulness can be seen in extracts from his written works.  Nothing he has written on the subject suggests any other attitude towards machine guns than that of serious respect.

From his report on an ambush he experienced while serving in the Sudan in March of 1898, barely two months later:

 *The Horse Artillery against enemy of this sort is no use. We felt the want of machineguns when working alongside of scrub for searching some of the tracks.*

From his *Review of the Work Done During the Training Season 1912*, a document aimed at bettering the proficiency of the cavalry:

 *More attention should be paid to the handling of cavalry machineguns when brigaded. Their drill and manoeuvre should, before departure to practice camp, attain a high standard of efficiency.*

From the agenda for a conference among the senior officers of I Corps on August 20, 1914:

 *German machine-guns are said to be well commanded; the French are believed to have lost heavily by attacking them with infantry.*

From a letter to his nephew, Oliver, November 1914:

 *You must not fret because you are not out here. There will be a great want of troops, and numbers are wanted. So I expect you will* **all** *soon be in the field. Meantime train your machine guns. It will repay you.*

[Note: It was around this time that the new Vickers machine gun had come into production and the BEF was in the awkward process of transferring over to it from the older, bulkier Maxim model]

From Haig's notes on a meeting between himself and Major-General Bannatine-Allason of the 51st Territorial Division in May of 1915:

 *Infantry peace-training was little use in teaching a company how to capture a house occupied by half a dozen machine-guns.  [Bannatine-Allason] should urge his men to operate at wide intervals, and use cover and try to bring a converging fire on the locality attacked.  We should also use our machine-guns as much as possible.*

By the next month, in a conference with then-Minister of Munitions David Lloyd George, Haig had already moved on from discussing the virtues of the guns that *did* exist to urging the manufacture of much lighter models -- which, in the event, did end up existing in the form of the far-more-portable Lewis guns.  In other venues he was showing a similar and insatiable interest in technological innovation; he cherished the aerial photography of the front lines which the RFC was able to provide him, and he was so enthusiastic about the possibilities afforded by the new "tanks" in 1916 that he may with some justice be said to have pushed them into action too early.  Even after their less than ideal debut at Flers, he placed an order for another thousand of the things to be delivered as swiftly as possible -- [another hope quashed by practical limitations](http://ww.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1uys7h/how_influential_were_armored_vehicles_tanks/cen0syl).  There is nothing in any of this that seems reconcilable with the absurdity attributed to him in the oft-cited quote. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a complicated problem!

It needs to be remembered that powered flight was still substantially a novelty during the Great War.  The first-ever parachute jump from a plane had only taken place in either 1911 or 1912, depending upon who you ask, and flying a plane was still such an unusual undertaking that the problem of parachutes for combat pilots had not been meaningfully tackled, or even really considered.  Planes had not been used -- at all, ever -- in inter-plane combat prior to this, and it was only during the war that they even began to be armed.  The possibility that a pilot would have to suddenly exit his disabled craft was a remote one up until the point that aircraft began to boast machine guns and accurate anti-aircraft fire became a reality.

The parachute situation during the war itself was fascinating.  Crews in observation balloons were given them as a matter of course -- they were stationary targets, totally unable to evade any incoming fire -- but these worked only because the balloon baskets actually had plenty of room for storage.  The parachutes were stored underneath the basket itself, with the observers tethered to them by a harness.  The parachute would be released by the tug of the observer's fall.  We've all seen WWII movies in which paratroopers leap out over occupied France; the principle is similar, though not identical.  A ripcord design had been patented (by an American, actually) in 1916, but the merits of this design didn't become clear until later.  This, I think, was the main thing against the idea.

Anyway: for pilots, the situation was necessarily quite different.  The design limitations of the planes employed by the combatant powers during the war made the kind of dangling parachute-sacks used by observation balloons impossible.  These were small planes made of wood and canvas, remember; we aren't talking about a Flying Fortress, where space is comparatively plentiful and another few pounds of weight can be easily tolerated.

R.E. Calthrop's "Guardian Angel" design was aggressively promoted by parachute enthusiasts in England -- not least of whom was Calthrop himself, who felt he hadn't been given a fair hearing by the Royal Flying Corps -- but its limitations were considerable.  It featured a bulky pack that forced the pilot to hunch up against the controls and changed the weight centre of the plane considerably.  What's more, much like the observation balloon parachutes, it relied on a harness attached to the body of the plane to tug the parachute free once the pilot had jumped.  Not every jump is the same, as you might imagine; the danger of the parachute becoming tangled up in the plane's various projections -- or simply not being able to deploy at all for basic physical reasons -- was very, very real.

The German air force was the first to mandate parachutes for its pilots, along lines similar (but not identical) to the Calthrop model.  It's worth noting that their success in this was severely limited.  While the chance at escape was welcomed gladly by the pilots to whom it was given, the parachutes ended up killing as many pilots as they saved.  

Now, it is often been suggested that a lack of parachutes was a consequence of some official disdain for the lives of pilots and a contempt for "cowardice", but this is a dramatic over-simplification.  One of the great crises facing Great Britain during the war was the problem of resource distribution.  Simply put, making planes was *expensive*, and the miracles that pilots in the RFC had hitherto been able to work in bringing down planes that had no right to still be aloft combined with this to make the Corps' administration wary of anything that might encourage wastage.  The money that might be put into such a stop-gap would -- it was thought -- be better spent in producing more robust planes and in training better pilots.  Both of these things were accomplished.  The history of aeronautical design as viewed through the lens of the RFC from 1914 to 1918 is seriously fascinating, and well worth investigating by those more familiar with the iconic monoplanes of WWII or the jet fighters of today.

In any case, all of the major combatant powers brought parachutes into service for their pilots before the war's end, though I seem to recall that the introduction of them to the nascent RAF (which came into being in April of 1918, replacing the earlier RFC) might actually have been delayed until shortly after the war due to production problems.  These things took time, but they did eventually come about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So while 1 million deaths for the British Empire and 1.2 million deaths for France may seem like a significant amount (because it was and is)

It does seem like a lot indeed, but it also weirdly fails to register on a national level for many countries where the census is concerned.  If you look at the statistics recorded by respective censuses before, during, and after the war, there is little evidence in the hard numbers that the war even took place.  For all that we speak of "a lost generation", the numbers bear out a far different picture -- a picture in which the war more or less supplanted the expected mortality of the period in terms of *cause* rather than in terms of actual *amount*.

The war (amazingly) actually offered an *improvement* on living conditions for many of its participants -- especially those who had previously been forced to make their livings in factories or mines. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This looks like a fantastic experience you have lined up.  I'm jealous.

Of the ones about which I know something:

 The Great War and Modern Memory by Paul Fussell

This is the most important and influential book on the First World War written during the twentieth century.  I also happen to think that it's one of the worst -- not necessarily for its quality *as writing*, which is quite high, but for the blinkered quality of its ideas, the arch emotional tone of its author, the fatuity of much of its analysis, the loose disregard for facts when they get in the way of polemic, and -- with all of this -- its near total impact upon the field of First World War studies since its publication.  I have more to say about it at greater length [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1egf8o/theory_thursday_professionalacademic_history/ca056vh).  It is a book that demands to be read, and it absolutely deserves to be on your list, but I recommend extreme caution as you go through it.

 The Face of Battle by John Keegan

It's an interesting but uneven piece.  Keegan's text was first published right in the middle of the huge boom in experience-oriented historical writing about the First World War (see MacDonald, Middlebrook, Leed, etc.), and -- though the book only focuses on the Somme for a third of its length -- Keegan is writing very much in this same vein.  The whole work is fascinating in this regard, but it is a work calculated to provoke a reaction from its very outset.  If you adhere to the thesis of what James Campbell has called "combat gnosticism" -- that is, that the experience of combat confers some privileged understanding of it and of conflict generally and of war even more generally -- you will bridle at the book from the very beginning: Keegan has no meaningful combat experience of any kind, and foregrounds his arguments with this admission.  Certainly his comments on "the experience" of Waterloo and Agincourt are necessarily more and more hypothetical as they go.  It's still marvelously written, anyway, and does contain much of value.

 Henry V by Shakespeare

Shakespeare's second-best play (after *Coriolanus*).  Read it.  Love it.  Remember it.

 The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien

An exquisite collection that dances across the boundaries between fact and fiction, memory and nightmare.  There are a number of pieces in here that function more like essays than like short stories, and there's a lot that O'Brien has to say about the role of conversation and "telling" in securing a sort of recovery for combat veterans in the modern age.  The book also frequently laments the impossibility of those conversations and that telling, however, so there's a tone of distant tragedy to everything even at its highest points.  Some of the stories are unforgettable, anyway, and you'd be well-served by the same author's *If I Die in a Combat Zone* and *Going After Cacciato*.

I have also to register my surprise at this point that Michael Herr's *Dispatches* is not on this list.

 Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card

A remarkable book, whatever controversies the author continues to court.  I think reading it in light of the others on this list will be an extremely interesting experience. </TEXT>

 just trying to turn every single known point of his life as show of demonic evil.

No...?  He's (correctly) pointing out Hitler's keen awareness of the importance of image-management and the part that this played in his rise to power.  There is nothing "demonically evil" about that, and nowhere is this even suggested.

 especially when the picture probably would've been taken there anyways if the guards had let him. Just seems like simple improvising, a workaround to me

Perhaps, but Moorhouse goes on to note that the man who actually took the picture chose that location specifically because of its better "fortress atmosphere."  An effect was intended, and it was achieved.  Nothing wrong with acknowledging that, especially when so many people for so long have been ignorant of this fact.

 It seems to me like the Author is grasping at straws, here. Trying to find new ways to hate the already most hated man in history.

You are really going pretty overboard on this yourself.  Moorhouse is instead concerned with the way in which Hitler's own moment of self-fashioning is still being taken at face value ninety years later even by scholars who should know better.  This piece is ultimately a critique of *them*, not of Hitler. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   And it may be that the sanctification of the later war has had more pernicious consequences than the anathematisation of the former. Any argument that the Great War was uniquely wicked and wasteful is plainly false in statistical terms, and the idea that the Good War was uniquely noble is absurd in view of its moral ambiguities.

 I am often at loss of words when I come across statements like this. The Germans had invaded and occupied a country which was protected by the Treaty of London (a treaty which Britain had signed). That in itself was a justification for going to war. Not only that, Germany had carried out atrocities all across Belgium throughout the start of hostilities. It is often forgotten that their eastern ally, The Ottoman empire was also waging it's own war against Russia which consequently led to the Armenian genocide. Again, it was Germany and her allies who were the aggressors. It's almost as if the author is trying to blame the victim(s) here. Ah, moral equivalencies.

You'll have to forgive me, but I really don't see how you get to the contents of your paragraph from the claims being made in the one you've quoted.  It seems like you're responding to something completely different from what the quoted author is saying.

Also, this:

 World War One was, as it's sometimes refered to, as a Royal Family Fued. The deadlock trench warfare and the hundreds of thousands who died for miles is a contentious issue to this day.

...is an absurd oversimplification worthy of a submission in /r/BadHistory itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not all that unusual, though.  

The title of "professor" is certainly applied to the ranks you'd expect -- assistant professors, associate professors, full professors and professors emeriti -- but it has also come to be applied to many who teach contract courses depending upon an often subjective mixture of their qualifications and their actual responsibilities during that contract.  Whatever the case may be at Algonquin, the Universities of Ottawa and Carleton both employ part-time or adjunct professors who are called as much in their contracts and who are also certainly allowed to refer to themselves as such.  The UO union for such employees -- the Association of Part-Time Professors of the University of Ottawa -- refers to them by this name as well.  I'm glad that they do, in fact, seeing as how I'm represented by them; my employee card, given to me by the university's HR department, says "Professor" on it.

Finally, since I just realized that this might be a source of the debate here: I meant in my previous post that there are numerous full- and part-time teaching/researching employees at Algonquin who have been hired with the specific title of and position of "professor," as stated by their contracts.  They are absolutely allowed to refer to themselves as such, but so too -- in cases like I've described above -- can some others. </TEXT>

Additionally:

 Clearly a reprint preceded this review, but I'm having difficulty finding *which* reprint Mr. Chesterton wrote an introduction for. 

I can actually shed some light on this, as Chesterton has been the focus of both my personal and professional interest for many years.  Chesterton provided a series of original introductions to each volume in a cheap, mass-market edition of Dickens' complete works; these introductions were collected in 1911 as *Appreciations and Criticisms of the Works of Charles Dickens*, which remains one of the most delightful introductory appreciations of Dickens' works I've ever read.  [His introduction](http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/dickens_A_C_1.html#I) to the collected volume gives some sense of his approach to the task, if you're interested.

I keep forgetting how astoundingly prolific he was.  This new collected volume came out in the same year as his book-lengthed poem, *The Ballad of the White Horse*, and also his first collection of the enormously popular *Father Brown* detective stories.

Anyway, thanks again for the wonderfully interesting answer to my question.  It's given me a lot of material with which to start. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yesterday I laid into a spot of discussion over in /r/Canada; today it's comments on [a commercial set against the backdrop](http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2m3wn0/sainsburys_brilliant_new_christmas_advert_based/) of the so-called "Christmas Truce" of 1914.  I cannot even express the feeling of weary dread I felt when seeing that this commercial even exists, to say nothing of what it would inevitably invite by being posted to Reddit.

I will say, first of all, that [the commercial](http://youtu.be/NWF2JBb1bvM) was indeed well-made.  Excellent production values, essentially well-acted, not even necessarily poorly-conceived.  There are naturally any number of comments (most massively downvoted) declaring this use of the war by a large department store chain to be tasteless and disgusting, but it should be acknowledged that the piece was made in co-operation with the Royal British Legion, with the new old-fashioned chocolate bar at the centre of the commercial being sold to raise funds for the Legion's charitable work.  All proceeds from the campaign are to be donated.

So why did I feel such dread?

Well, what else should I feel at the prospect of the most overly sentimentalized event of the war being used for commercial purposes in a piece of film that will then be commented upon by Redditors?  I almost didn't bother -- but I could not resist.

A mercifully downvoted comment sums up everything that I hate about everything:

 Very cynical and in poor taste. The only way this could have worked was to see the soldiers blown to pieces moments later, rather than 'Christmas is for sharing' - what bullshit. Most of these guys would have been dead within weeks/months. The truce ended because the generals were terrified at such fraternisation Better to watch OH WHAT A LOVELY WAR instead and remember that the whole war was a disaster, a slaughter of young working class people who were seen as cannon fodder , the destruction of a whole generation of men, rather than try to sell a supermarket and wrap yourself in both the flag and hollow sentimentality. See the same incident, but made by a filmmaker with integrity, here: [Oh what a lovely war!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHObCL2luMw). Marketing people are the worst.

This is almost like a parody -- like someone took every stale, underexamined complaint about the war and threw it all together in a blender and then just posted whatever came out, garbled and all.

 "...blown to pieces moments later..."  

This is a surprisingly common sentiment throughout the thread; "and then they went right back to shooting each other," etc.  Some step in to note that they were ordered to by superiors who were not keen to see this collapse of morale fester any further, but the obvious military rectitude of this is immediately thrown under the bus of sentiment.  In any case, it simply is not true that they would all have been "blown to pieces moments later."  Many sectors where truce events happened, and in which superior officers were not sufficiently able to re-establish order, saw a continued dithering of hostilities over the 26th and even up to the New Year.  Not every sector was a hot one anyway, so even this full resumption of hostilities would have looked quite muted in many places.  There's a reason that the major offensives of the war were planned for the spring and summer months; attacking in December is not exactly ideal.

 "The truce ended because the generals were terrified of such fraternisation."  

Well, "terrified" is rather a strong word, and it wasn't just the generals (those loathsome icons!) who were worried about the prospect.  Even commanding officers in the trenches themselves were uneasy about the truces, given the chaos they sowed and the ultimate collapse of morale that they threatened, and we certainly have many records of troops on all sides who responded to truce events in 1914 with gunfire, and were glad to have done so.  Civilians -- from statesmen down to the man in the street -- also had cause to fear what events like these presaged, given the likelihood of them prolonging the war rather than concluding it efficiently.  The widescale mobilization of civilian populations to contribute to the war effort essentially demanded that the militant arm of that effort keep up its own work; workers making shells, sewing clothes, manufacturing rations, and so on, did not have the liberty of any sort of "Christmas Truce," and would likely have balked at the prospect of taking one.  Knowing that the men they were breaking their backs to supply were just fucking around instead of fighting to a finish would not be a happy prospect.  

Finally, I should note that no matter what "the generals" may have liked to do on the Western Front, the likelihood of the truce meaningfully enduring without their attempts to stop it are very miniscule indeed.  One good reason for this is the division of responsibilities and of distance that existed between the infantry and artillery arms of the army.  Artillery officer memoirs reported far, far fewer encounters with any sort of truce events, given their remove from direct contact with the enemy firing line, and many reported thinking it was a joke when first they got the news.  What of the days to come?  The 26th comes around, the batteries open up -- and suddenly there's a frantic telephone call from the captain a kilometer ahead of them saying "stop that bloody firing, there's a truce on!"  What are they even supposed to do?

 "Better to watch OH WHAT A LOVELY WAR instead...  See the same incident, but made by a filmmaker with integrity, here: [Oh what a lovely war!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHObCL2luMw)"  

The only sense in which this is true is that it has better production values.  In no sense, however, is it a good film to watch as an accurate examination of the events of the First World War.  It is as nakedly a piece of propaganda as it is possible to be, and the fact that this user seems to think it's a product of total integrity is just astounding to me.  It is a musical comedy.  It is both a satire of the war's contemporary propaganda and a piece of modern propaganda in its own right.  The historical consultant for the play and film, the former Labour MP Raymond Fletcherr, boasted that *Lovely*'s message was "one part [him], one part Liddell Hart, the rest Lenin."  [My complaints about Liddell Hart](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1pq02a/hearken_back_to_precolonialist_india_the_idea_of/cd4wbkg) have been aired elsewhere, and Lenin's apparent  (if abstract) influence on the film's portrayal of the war should likely cause concern.  As for Fletcher himself, the release of the Mitrokhin Archive in 1992 revealed that the late Fletcher had in fact been a Soviet spy.  Dan Todman has considerably more to say about the film's genesis [here](http://www.warhistorian.org/todman.php). 

 "...and remember that the whole war was a disaster, a slaughter of young working class people who were seen as cannon fodder, the destruction of a whole generation of men..."

For fuck's sake.

My rather atypical opinions about the actual merits of the Christmas Truce have already been aired amid considerable controversy, so I should probably just stop here, for now. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-11-12 22:37:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This will probably earn a contemptible low-effort tag, but my God: I am too annoyed by this not to post it here, but also too busy to give it the attention it deserves.

A lot of political cartoons get posted in /r/Canada; [this one from yesterday](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2lyp9q/remember_who_they_still_are_in_spirit/) generated more than the usual amount of discussion.  It largely stems from the thread's top comment, which is the usual thing about the gnostic privilege of combat experience, the rich sending the poor off to die, veterans heroically repudiating medals, the true meaning of etc.  People are welcome to their opinions even when they are not ones I share, but I find this all rather dull.

But this thread... this fucking thread.  

Already in [another submission](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2m0vrd/myths_about_the_myths_about_ww1/) today in /r/BadHistory, we've seen a certain amount of justifiable fatigue at the constant stream of "FWW was futile/pointless/stupid/etc." pieces being released.  This is, I think, one of the problems with mainstream civilian engagement with military history; in no other field would such completely unqualified people be allowed to pontificate on professional and often technical matters so pompously, and in no other field would it be not only permitted but encouraged to simply say the same goddamn thing about the subject with every passing year.  People making posts like these or writing articles like the one addressed in the other BH thread seem not to know or care that FWW scholarship has changed considerably since the 1960s and 70s; there are entire new schools of research about the war at the present hour, with many cherished assumptions having been thoroughly upended.  None of this seems to matter.

The /r/Canada thread constitutes yet another barrage from this most pointless of batteries:

 If there had been no more war after that, then maybe all the remembrance, parades and accolades would mean something. All the death and destruction of WWI was for nothing, and therefore so was the sacrifice of all those people. I mourn all their loss, ruination and sacrifice but it wasn't worth it. It is never ever worth it. 

That's from the opening comment, but there are plenty of others to echo the sentiment:

 What cause was there for anyone to fight for in the First World War?

 ---

 WW1 was a meaningless war and a terrible tragedy for all sides. There was no "right" or "wrong" side. It was just a big war between imperial powers that was fought with no regard for the lives of the young men that were used as cannon fodder on the front.

 ---

 WWI is an excellent example of a horrific, pointless war. WWII is an excellent example of a necessary war -- to stop a war of aggression by an evil dictator.

What strikes me most about all of this is its casual surrender to ignorance.  The people who directed the war had very clear ideas about what it meant, what it ought to cost, how it was to be conducted, what strategic goals had to be achieved and what tactical means might best achieve them.  Sometimes those ideas proved inadequate to circumstance, but this is hardly a novelty in the history of combat and was not any more pronounced in the FWW than in any conflict before or since.  None of this is a mystery, though; you can go and quite easily read all of the various white papers and blue books and reports and declarations and speeches of those whose clashing spheres of power helped bring the war about.  It's all there, in black and white, much of it digitized and searchable and accessible for free by anyone.  So too is an endless array of opinion and hypothesis by those involved in the war; their thoughts and opinions can be known to us, their motives examined, their decisions explained.  You don't have to make bland assumptions or shrug despairingly when you can [just go read this](http://www.amazon.ca/Origins-First-World-War-Diplomatic/dp/0719074215/).

And yet... so many people do anyway.  It's easier.  If the war still happened in spite of the intellectual efforts of some of the smartest people in the world in dozens of different countries, what chance does the typical Redditor have of understanding it all?  The volume I linked to above is not even comprehensive (though it is very, very good), but it's still the size of a phone book.  Who has that kind of time?  Who could be bothered to read all of these diplomatic cables and treaties and plans and memoranda when you can just shrug it all off as a conflict in which "there was no 'right' or 'wrong' side"; as "just a big war between imperial powers that was fought with no regard for the lives of the young men that were used as cannon fodder on the front."  Nobody would even be mad if you did, because they're all doing it too.

The First World War **had actual causes**.  The First World War **bore actual results**.  Most of the First World War **happened on purpose for reasons that can be reflected upon and understood**.  The fact that it was intensely complicated and multi-faceted does not mean that we must simply give up, and it certainly does not give us the right to claim that nothing about it could possibly make sense.  It can; you just have to be prepared to do the work, and many people seem totally unwilling or unable to.  The war's leading scholars do not describe it in the trivial and reductive fashion of those in my quoted passages above; they know enough not to.  Who stands the better chance of being right about this?

Every conceivable strand of tired, reductive apologia is trotted out in that thread.  It's incredible to watch people progress indifferently through the whistle stops of "Germany did nothing wrong," to "even if they did everyone else was also wrong," to "well even if Belgium suffered they deserved it somehow because Congo," to "well even if that's a moot point war is still stupid so there," as though simply admitting to being wrong about something is worse than inventing a new reason to be upset on the spot.  Why must people be like this about such tremendously complicated and interesting subjects?  Why in the world are so many people actually satisfied with not knowing or thinking about a subject on which they nevertheless feel the need to broadcast strong opinions?  It's appalling.

The rest of that thread is a train wreck.  Everyone is accusing everyone else of glorifying war and not remembering things properly, or at least not ceremonializing that remembrance properly.  Heavily downvoted comments repudiate the very idea of commemoration, dismissing veterans as hired murderers who etc. 

Four more years, everyone.

**EDIT:**

Meanwhile, [one of the comments](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2lyp9q/remember_who_they_still_are_in_spirit/clzw2kx) I didn't mention because oh my god:

 Yeah, what a great reason to send tens of thousands of Canadians to their deaths. I mean, heaven forbid our politicians, the people chosen among us to PREVENT THOSE FUCKING MASSACRES FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE ever lift a finger to actually do anything but rally popular war support.

 It's not like we could've paid attention to the rising tensions in Europe and actually sent help over while it was still relevant to calm everyone the fuck down. It's not like Canada is an amazing country to grow hemp which could then be burned on battlefields like incense, causing a sudden downward shift in aggressiveness for every soldier for miles around.

The article seems quite short, and Caillois was considerably disenchanted with Bataille and his various excesses by this time, so I have no idea how reliable a source it is.

The thing, though, is that **I would have no trouble at all believing this of Bataille**, who was completely out of his entire mind in many interesting ways -- I just have no real substance to place behind it, at present.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In modern times (with a very long lens being used for "modern", here), it has become something of a sad joke for a senior English politician to be made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  

It is currently a position without real responsibilities that is granted to a junior cabinet minister without a portfolio.  While this may sound like a remarkably cushy job (and it is), it is also basically seen as a political dumping ground for people to whom the incoming administration had made cabinet promises but who, in the end, really cannot be admitted to the cabinet proper.  Many people have found themselves in this position and simply shrugged it off, going on -- like Winston S. Churchill, Clement Atlee, Lord Beaverbrook, etc. -- to bigger and better things.  Others, however, have not responded so favourably.  Charles F.G. Masterman felt that the position was given to him as a slight, and that it had more or less ruined his career; Arthur Ponsonby also somewhat resented the position, feeling it was stifling his effectiveness as a reformer, and Sir Oswald Mosley felt so jilted at having been reduced to it and its attendant inconsequence that he eventually resigned and [went off to do other things](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nkyoa/wednesday_week_in_history_oct_2_oct_8/ccjjzgs).

I know that the actual responsibilities of the Chancellor re: the Duchy itself have now descended to "a deputy", as Wikipedia vaguely describes it, but I'm not entirely sure why, or why this particular position should have become the de facto "also-ran" prize for people who might otherwise have been important.  Does anyone know? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sir Douglas Haig and the Machine Gun -or- The Perils of 'What Everyone Knows' </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-26 19:44:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With the Centenary of the British entry into the First World War nearly at hand, I am moved to post a reminder about one of the more spurious and frustrating pieces of Bad History that is routinely trotted out in criticism of one of the war's most controversial figures: Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.  Haig was Commander-in-Chief of the British Armies in France from the end of 1915 onward, having replaced Sir John French, and his post-war legacy [has been a complicated one to say the least](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hfffk/monday_mysteries_contested_reputations/cattizk).  An initial wave of laudatory biographies of the Field Marshal gave way to more critical (and eventually scathing) assessments, but in recent years he has experienced something of a rehabilitation -- at least among academic historians.  His popular reputation remains as shabby as ever.

One frequently cited failing of Haig's was his unimaginative neglect of the machine gun as an important weapon.  This quote, widely attributed to him, is regularly offered in evidence of this:

 **"The machine gun is a much-overrated weapon and two per battalion would be more than sufficient."** (Usually cited as coming from Haig in 1915, but taken as definitive of his perspective as a whole)

The claim that Haig was blindly opposed to machine guns flies in the face of numerous other well-attested declarations by him from both before and after the statement above was purported to have been made.

The genesis of this claim does not lie in any of Haig's own documents, first and foremost; the **sole** attestation of it comes from the memoirs of one Christopher Baker-Carr (*From Chauffeur to Brigadier*, 1930), a major who was put in charge of the BEF's new machine gun school in November of 1914.  Baker-Carr's narrative of his early days with this academy is one of consistent frustration with the army's general staff, who apparently resisted his suggested innovations every step of the way.  John Terraine, in an amazing chapter in *The Smoke and the Fire* (1980), has pretty definitively shown that this narrative is rather unlikely in its own right, as all existing records apart from Baker-Carr's memoirs indicate that the general staff basically did everything he suggested very quickly in spite of any reservations they might have had.  I mention this not to put a slight on Baker-Carr himself, who was a remarkably interesting and accomplished person, but rather to establish that his memoirs may not be the most reliable account of all that transpired and that a great deal of personal pique seems to have made its way into them.

To give an example of this fantasticality which is essential to the quote being discussed, at some point in late December of 1914 Baker-Carr forwarded an urgent suggestion to the staff that the number of machine guns deployed among front-line battalions should be doubled.  He describes in anger having received a number of seemingly unaccommodating notes in return, including one from "an army commander" saying that "the machine-gun was a much over-rated weapon and two per battalion were more than sufficient."  We'll return to this in a few seconds, as it is the main focus of this post, but I will note first that the staff generals, contrary to Baker-Carr's unhappy declarations in his memoirs, *took his advice* and doubled the guns by February of 1915.  A mere two-month turnaround on doubling the number of guns among all front-line battalions -- at the urging of an untested officer representing a new training school -- would not seem to suggest foot-dragging or indifference on the staff's part, and this is even more apparent when manufacturing limitations are considered.  

By 1914 the Maxim was already on the way out.  Both the British and the Germans were using the heavy, outdated 1908 model, and the onset of the war inspired a flurry of redesign.  For the British this took the form of the new Vickers and Lewis guns; the former was far more reliable when it came to the problem of over-heating, and the latter was much, much more portable than any previous widely-adopted design.  The Germans stuck with the Maxims when it came to arming static gun emplacements, but also developed a portable counterpart to the Lewis, the Bergmann.

At the war's outset, the available machine guns would have been hard to widely distribute for anyone involved even if they did understand the weapon's merits.  The allocation of machine guns per infantry battalion was indeed two -- two, that is, for roughly a thousand men.  This was a matter of unhappy necessity rather than contented policy, however, as even though the War Office had placed a production order with Vickers for 196 new machine guns after the first week of the war, Vickers could only produce ten to twelve such guns per week.  It took time for the infrastructure necessary for widescale production to be developed, and it is in this context that any early-war statements on gun distribution should be considered.

In any event, let us turn to the quote itself.  

First, Baker-Carr does not even explicitly say that it was Haig who said it -- only "an army commander."  Insisting that this refers to Haig requires a number of stretches.  The first is that he meant "army commander" in a literal rather than general sense; just prior to the war, the numerous men to whom his brief was addressed would have been referred to as corps commanders -- "army commander" was a necessary creation to accommodate the vast expansion of the army in wartime, but was still often used in lieu of "corps commander" on a casual basis in spite of it having become a formal rank.  Which would mean that, in addition to just the two formal Army Commanders (note the capitals), who were Horace Smith-Dorrien and Douglas Haig, the comment could be referring to any of the following:

- Charles Monro of I Corps
- Charles Fergusson of II Corps
- William Pulteney of III Corps
- Henry Rawlinson of IV Corps
- Herbert Plumer of V Corps
- And John French, the Commander-in-Chief

There was also Edmund Allenby of the Cavalry Corps, but it seems very unlikely that his word on the subject would have mattered enough to Baker-Carr to put him out as much as he suggests.  The comment -- assuming it is being properly ascribed -- could have come from any of them.

The reader may, at this point, reasonably ask why it couldn't have been Horace Smith-Dorrien who provided the quote above.  The main thing militating against this is that he -- like Haig, as we shall shortly see -- had been and would continue to be an enthusiastic supporter of the machine gun throughout the war; nevertheless, unlike Haig, his career was abruptly terminated in 1915 after a personal falling-out with Sir John French.  He is remembered primarily for his fortuitous decision to have II Corps turn and stand at Le Cateau during the retreat from Mons, and his subsequent nine months as a general preceded any of the parts of the war that are generally conceived of as being so catastrophically dumb.  He never had to preside over subsequent, less-flashily-satisfying campaigns (like Loos, or the Somme, or Arras, or Passchendaele), and nobody consequently found it necessary to develop lurid conspiracies about his callousness, his incompetence, his lack of imagination, his barbarity, etc. etc., into which some later claim about an ignorance of the value of a certain weapon could be so easily integrated.

Haig's own documents, by contrast, whether they be letters, dispatches or personal journals, are unequivocal in their support of machine guns as a necessary and much-desired innovation.  He took time out of his leave in January of 1898 to visit the Enfield gun works and see in both production and action the Maxim machine guns that they were then producing; his opinion of this weapon's usefulness can be seen in extracts from his written works.  Nothing he has written on the subject suggests any other attitude towards machine guns than that of serious respect.

From his report on an ambush he experienced while serving in the Sudan in March of 1898, barely two months later:

 *The Horse Artillery against enemy of this sort is no use. We felt the want of machineguns when working alongside of scrub for searching some of the tracks.*

From his *Review of the Work Done During the Training Season 1912*, a document aimed at bettering the proficiency of the cavalry:

 *More attention should be paid to the handling of cavalry machineguns when brigaded. Their drill and manoeuvre should, before departure to practice camp, attain a high standard of efficiency.*

From the agenda for a conference among the senior officers of I Corps on August 20, 1914:

 *German machine-guns are said to be well commanded; the French are believed to have lost heavily by attacking them with infantry.*

From a letter to his nephew, Oliver, November 1914:

 *You must not fret because you are not out here. There will be a great want of troops, and numbers are wanted. So I expect you will* **all** *soon be in the field. Meantime train your machine guns. It will repay you.*

[Note: It was around this time that the new Vickers machine gun had come into production and the BEF was in the awkward process of transferring over to it from the older, bulkier Maxim model]

From Haig's notes on a meeting between himself and Major-General Bannatine-Allason of the 51st Territorial Division in May of 1915:

 *Infantry peace-training was little use in teaching a company how to capture a house occupied by half a dozen machine-guns.  [Bannatine-Allason] should urge his men to operate at wide intervals, and use cover and try to bring a converging fire on the locality attacked.  We should also use our machine-guns as much as possible.*

By the next month, in a conference with then-Minister of Munitions David Lloyd George, Haig had already moved on from discussing the virtues of the guns that *did* exist to urging the manufacture of much lighter models -- which, in the event, did end up existing in the form of the far-more-portable Lewis guns.  In other venues he was showing a similar and insatiable interest in technological innovation; he cherished the aerial photography of the front lines which the RFC was able to provide him, and he was so enthusiastic about the possibilities afforded by the new "tanks" in 1916 that he may with some justice be said to have pushed them into action too early.  Even after their less than ideal debut at Flers, he placed an order for another thousand of the things to be delivered as swiftly as possible -- [another hope quashed by practical limitations](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1uys7h/how_influential_were_armored_vehicles_tanks/cen0syl).  There is nothing in any of this that seems reconcilable with the absurdity attributed to him in the oft-cited quote.

**TL;DR:** "Everyone knows" that Sir Douglas Haig was an incompetent butcher who resisted technological innovations and who failed to understand the realities of the war that he was asking his men to fight.  It is very easy to imagine that such a person might have declared machine-guns to be overrated and of little use.  Unfortunately, the source for this claim comes from a single, non-specific sentence by a hostile memoirist writing on a different subject years after Haig's death, and the evidence about Haig's opinion of machine guns that we find in his own documents suggests rather the opposite view. </TEXT>
