	<TITLE> So I gave this brainteaser to my 7th grade students, and then attempted to solve it myself but I didn't get the answer they listed on their answer key as did other students and even the math teacher. Can someone explain their answer or point out my flaw. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Nailed it. You need 3 corners in the new era of the NFL. Just like you need 3 capable WRs to be a good offense. Teams make it a point to pick on 3rd CBs. Plus, Smith isn't a spring chicken anymore. I think the raiders have to take him at 14 if he is available.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ha! I love this. I think you're close. Earn respect in the AFC West, maybe win the division. Get to the playoffs. Make some noise and make some the city show their hand. </TEXT>
