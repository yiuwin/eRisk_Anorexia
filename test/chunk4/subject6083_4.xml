	<TEXT> He's about 9-10 weeks old. He got plenty of exercise, he ran all around the house the whole day, he was quite hyper.

I'm just afraid something bad will happen if I leave him like this until tomorrow morning. But at the same time everyone says to just ignore. I can hear him crying constantly and clawing at the crate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was lucky enough to get him. The guy has a 93 mid and an 84 3pt shot. Online, whenever I am open with him, I get an excellent rating with either a B+ or an A. I ALWAYS miss. I am not exaggerating. I always miss. I've probably taken 100-200 shots with him in the past week. I am not kidding when I say I can't recall the last time I made a jumper with him.

And does Finisher even work? I've attempted countless contact layups with him, none of them have gone in, even though finisher lights up every time. It's ridiculous aahaha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah bro still works. You start a game with a throwaway lineup on Domination and quit after you get past the loading screen.

You do this with players you don't care about. I use this trick all the time with the MyTeam team (east + west all stars).

I have pretty much everyone out of there now though. I still do it. You get like 7000 points from the game, plus another 13000 for getting a duplicate gold player. Almost 20000 points a game. </TEXT>

Make a lineup full of bronze players you don't care about. Go in the Utah game and quit as soon as you get past the loading screen. The stars should get reset for Utah. Go for the 3 stars again. Same thing happened to me with the Knicks.

For Portland:
It's because of server issues. Nothing we can do about that one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dennis Schroeder at PG; he's extremely fast and has great ball handling. He's a very consistent shooter and his release is very easy to get used to. He's 6'1, that may be a problem for some people, not me though.

Kyle Korver at SG; the guy never misses a 3 as long as he's at least a little bit open.

Shabazz Muhammad at SF; very consistent shooter at mid range or at 3 point range. Sweet jumpshot as well.

Reggie Evans at PF; 99 defensive AND offensive rebound.

Jonas Valanciunas at C; has a mid range shot and great in the post.

These are my starters. I hear Gerald Green, Caldwell-Pope, Reggie Jackson, Terrence Ross, and Tim Hardaway Jr. are all good bronze players as well. I haven't been lucky enough to get them, so I can't tell. </TEXT>
