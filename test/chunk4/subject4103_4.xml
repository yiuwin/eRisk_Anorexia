	<TEXT> St. Ambrose didn't think himself too pure to talk with a manifest heretic who had an illegitimate child with a concubine, and helped him turn into St. Augustine. I think we can manage to dialogue with a person who decided to use a naughty word in an online handle a long time ago, who is earnestly seeking truth and seems to be positively disposed toward the Catholic faith. Which attitude is likely to lead to the conversion of her soul: a dismissive venomous attitude like yours, or a welcoming one that seeks to inform her about the joy and truth of the Catholic faith? Vatican II may have had its issues, particularly in interpretation and implementation, but if it made attitudes like yours unpopular then there's at least one positive aspect that came out of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's already well underway. Just look at some of the things Peter Singer says and the fact that he's considered a brilliant academic instead of a heartless madman. People think you can just conjure universal morals out of the aether, but don't realize how steeped we are in a Christian worldview to support what we think of as obvious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This comment helps neither your soul nor hers. Fraternal correction must always be done in charity, lest you become simply a clanging gong. I too am a fan of the Extraordinary Form, but the fact that it is associated in people's minds with attitudes like the one displayed in your comments makes it that much harder to institute in parishes. If you wished to address the impropriety of her username, there are several ways that would have been more charitable and encouraged her closer to God. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll see if I can invoke the Catechism bot properly. Long story short, the conscience is not infallible but Magisterial teachings are. Somebody that has a conscience that tells them that throwing toddlers of a cliff for fun is okay has a badly formed conscience. A conscience is not just a person determining what's right on their own but a participation in a higher truth, authored by God. People can, through ignorance or obstinance, form a conscience poorly and come to incorrect conclusions. You can also see St. John Paul II's stance in Veritatis Splendor, which speaks against many errors regarding the false notion of autonomy of individual conscience.

	<TEXT> Things are only going to get worse from here, I think. Western culture has long abandoned that which made it great, which was full recognition of the nature of the human person, particularly in relation to God. Without that, the institutions created have become insensible, then finally dissolved. These are just the latest tremors in a quake that has been building for hundreds of years. Recent wide information availability has simply accelerated the process. Now, relationships are judged based on the immediate feelings created, and the value of a person is based on their capabilities, and not on their identity. The allowance of gay "marriage" and abortion are simply extensions of a mindset that has been present for some time. What we need is to properly educate members of the Church about this implicit mindset in our culture, and instruct them on the correct way of viewing the world and our place in it. Which, unlike secular views, is actually cohesive and logical. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard this myself. It seems almost like a more grown-up version of a child figuring out that other kids call their parents "mommy" and "daddy" too. 

Was the person from the Midwestern United States? I could at least see the mistake since most spoken media have the majority of people speaking in that way. I think news anchors are still taught to speak with that accent. It could skew you to think that your accent is normal and everyone else's is an aberration. Or if you've really only been exposed to people from your part of the world. </TEXT>

It's either something they arrived at through a bizarre chain of reasoning, or else something false they were once told and never had occasion to question. What did they say? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went to Sandy Hook Elementary growing up, and was a teacher in Newtown until this school year. At my school, things are pretty much normal and you don't notice any difference on the surface. It's little things that let you know something has happened. If there's a siren in the distance, you can see their attention go up and they look around at each other. There's obvious unspoken fear there. If an administrator goes over the loudspeaker and doesn't sound quite right - a little too intense or worried - they notice right away and wonder what's going on. They've had several lock-ins and lockdowns since Sandy Hook, and it always brings out a wash of emotions that are typically held back. Several break down and cry, or rock slowly to themselves from their position on the floor (everyone's on the floor in a lockdown). Several had relatives that were killed, and many had friends or siblings' friends from outside of school that were killed. One of my students' little sister was killed, and another one had an aunt killed in the shooting. It's a pretty close-knit community, so pretty much everyone has some connection to a victim. I have a friend that went to school with Adam Lanza before he was pulled out to be homeschooled. We're moving on, but it's definitely taken its toll on the community, particularly the children. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't a writing response, so I don't know if it's allowed, but the old Nickelodeon show "Space Cases" had a storyline exactly like this. One of the crew members, Catalina, was from Saturn and frequently talked to her invisible friend Suzee. In season 2 Suzee became part of the cast and Catalina disappeared because of a dimensional tear and other such sci-fi hand waving.

	<TEXT> Chrono Trigger. I played the SNES version so much I got every character up to level **. I buy the game every time it comes out on a new platform. Love that game.

Also up there is Dragon Force for the Sega Saturn. Not as well-known, but I got the system for that game and it was worth it. Still play it every so often but I can't save anymore since the memory card no longer gets recognized. Sony definitely had the design for early external memory down better. I'm still sad Dragon Force 2 was never localized. On the plus side, thanks to this post I looked it up just in case, and it seems that fans are working on a patch for an English version. Soon my dream from nearly 20 years ago will be fulfilled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that was part of the point of the game though. You spend the first part of the game thinking you're playing as an All-American golden boy war hero. Then as you learn more, you realize Cole's entire persona is a thin faade. He's no war hero. He's a terrible leader and a bit of a coward who blundered into a situation where he got recognized by a superior officer and marketed as a hero to the folks back home. Part of the reason why the guys on the boat go along with the plan for the drugs is because they're ticked off about their idiot Lieutenant being treated like a hero. He hates himself almost as much as you, the player, start to hate him, and the affair is only one part of his guilt-ridden breakdown. To be honest, even his success in homicide is overrated considering he made several false arrests before finding the truth. He redeems himself somewhat, but Cole isn't really supposed to be a sympathetic character by the end of the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically it means that the pope can declare himself to be speaking "ex cathedra" which means "from the chair" and definitively declare a matter of faith or morals such that it is binding for all members of the Church. It's only been used a couple of times in history. Young-Earth Creationism isn't a matter of faith or morals, so the Church does not hold an official position. The only time an official statement on evolution was made was to say that it did not directly contradict the Catholic faith. This has been affirmed several times since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, but it hasn't even been released yet. And the media are already playing the tired old canard to pretend that Francis is super-progressive relative to his predecessors and therefore agrees with everything in the "liberal" category, since as we all know you can only ever be completely on one side or the other. That's what's upsetting - the fact that they are trying to shoehorn the Church into these narrow modern categories and winding up muddying the waters rather than doing their job of actually reporting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right up there with people who don't understand papal infallibility. We're just sick of the media playing games to make it seem like Francis is totally super-different from all previous popes, when he hasn't said anything contradicting Church Doctrine or opposed to what previous popes have said. The media just wants to play the liberal/conservative false dichotomy to pretend Benedict XVI was some big evil meanie while Francis is super-enlightened and progressive and the only pope to ever not kick puppies into volcanoes for fun. The biggest difference is that Francis isn't entrenched in European politics so he's not afraid to strong arm the Curia and hash out the parasites, which is a good thing. Also Benedict was more of a bookworm and intellectual, while Francis is more of an extrovert who can rally people. Those are the biggest differences. Not their beliefs or what they've said, which are not very far apart at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a couple of nieces who I really think would love the Discworld series and I was wondering if you could give me some advice on which book they should read first to hook them. I figure Tiffany Aching would be a good place to start, but I was hoping somebody could help me decide which "adult" Pratchett book could really draw them in. Especially advice from female readers who started reading in middle/high school.

Niece 1: Age 13. Enjoys reading books, especially traditional fantasy. Other interests include anime and video games, particularly Japanese RPGs.

Niece 2: Age 15. Reads even more than the younger one. Also enjoys fantasy, but her favorite genres are history and historical fiction. I think she'd really enjoy some of the obscure references Pratchett makes. Also enjoys Doctor Who.

A starting point for one or both would be much appreciated, thanks! </TEXT>
