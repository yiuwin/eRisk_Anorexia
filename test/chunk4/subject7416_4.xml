	<TEXT> It is part of this this garbage idea that people can't just casually enjoy anything, that they have to be die-hard fans something to have any sort of valid opinions or to truly like something. It isn't enough to appreciate the movie for what they are, we have to love them and think they ara amazing, and we can't just watch them once every year or two, we have to study the movies, and we need to buy tacky graphic t-shirts... because god forbid we just watch movies and have fun.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also appropriate if it is generally expected of people to have a certain level of knowledge to post there, which is also fine in my opinion. It might border on gatekeeping, but it it is a sub that is supposed to be for people who already understand some fundamental things about the subject then it is perfectly okay.

Now if the sub didn't have that framework, yeah then he was being a dick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because building a channel from the ground up is difficult, and SourcefedNerd still had over a million subscribers, so they thought they could just swoop in and take over. Obviously it is a fucked up thing to do, but I understand why, although it was pretty shortsighted of them, because this new channel will probably fail miserably. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well here is the thing, trans people are a minority everywhere, but being a minority doesn't mean that you should have to be dismissed as a niche or fringe group. On top of that language will always evolve, and taking a few steps to more inclusive might be forced (as in deliberate), but it won't hurt you and it will make it easier for the people involved. And you don't really need to introduce new and complicated terminology into the language, in Norway we have that same problem where we use sex to describe both gender and biological sex, but we just call gender social sex instead.  </TEXT>

Now if you're talking about language, and whether or not you have different words for gender and sex, then that might be the case. But I can gurantee you that there are trans people in Poland.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it is important to keep in mind that the vast majority of trans people and allies agrees that there is a difference between gender and sex, so this is not some anti-science push from the left, even though I am sure many people are running with that bogus story already. 

This was most likely a misguided attempt of the copyright owners of the show to avoid controversy, it was never some sort of hysterical anti-intellectualism perpetrated by "SJW" to spare people's feeling, nor was there any real demand for the segment in question to be cut. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah like I said in another thread, if people wanted to donate to Phil so he could buy enough skittles to fill a pool, then that would be perfectly okay. Because as long as the person is honest about what the patreon money go to, then that is all that matters, it is people's own money to spend however they want. 

Like I don't want to donate to anyone on patreon, not even Phil, but if I wanted to know it would be simply based on who I believed deserved my money and what I believed I could gain from it. And with a larger audience Phil can provide his donators with something that smaller youtubers probably couldn't. So the only thing that matters is honesty, because all I think Phil is obligated to do is to be transparent about where the money is going. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know man, this really isn't gatekeeping, sure he is being rude, but this seems just like an excuse to bitch about a slightly shitty confontration... and before you say I am gatekeeping or something, I am not, questioning whether or not something belongs in a sub is not an exclusionary tactic 

Edit: Don't bother to read the conversation with OP, it is not at all funny or interesting, and it gets incredibly stupid after a while. 

Edit 2: It is a waste of time, please for your own sake don't spend time on this stupidity, it isn't even the fun kinda drama, it is just lame, boring, and needlessly long.  </TEXT>
