	<TEXT> DotA 2 is about embracing multiversity. If the Philippines get their own server, then other countries in SEA such as Malaysia will also whine about not having good enough ping and wanting to have their own individual server. It is not by enclosing ourselves that we will make any positive advancements towards one's acceptance of his international community. 
Instead, why not simply asking Valve to improve the already existing servers. 

On a side note, I play in SEA and usually average at 20ms. Given that the Philippines is a developing country, it is understandable that the internet connections there might be a bit abrupt in some areas (ask your cable service provider, not valve, if that's the case). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My brother stupidly connected the balance plug of my lipo battery to the 3 channel 2.4G receiver. When he put it, he said that there was a bit of smoke, I'm guessing that he destroyed the receiver. Is there anything I could do? Do you think that it's even broken? When I plug the battery back in, I can see that the fan and the motor are working, but I feel that the receiver is dead is the lipo fine?, any suggestion?

	<TEXT> Not a chemistry teacher, but one of my former chemistry teachers once told us this brilliant anecdote. Back when he was teaching in Greece, one of his colleagues was teaching his class reactivity and the chemical properties of the group one metals, and did the good old demo with the sodium and the water and the nice little explosion. At the end of the class a fairly large lump of sodium vanished from the lab, and the teacher couldn't find out where it was. Two hours later, a couple of his students wandered into the bathroom, chucked a HUGE lump of sodium into the toilet and ran like hell. They were caught, and the missing sodium was explained by the fact that the stall completely exploded, so end of story in a pretty comical way. As the laughter subsided in our class, our chemistry teacher then added on to the story, as if an afterthought, "and the student in the stall next to them was killed. The teacher is still in prison in Greece." Never has an awkward silence settled in so fast. </TEXT>
