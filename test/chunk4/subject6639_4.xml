	<TEXT> I have no idea where you are located, but there are a lot of professors, psychiatrists, and psychologists in the Bay Area that look for students or graduates to assist in research. I would research this through hospitals (someone is bound to know something, especially by word of mouth) or sometimes contacting your local NAMI organisation for information on possible research experiences. You may not be in school anymore, but your help will be very much appreciated and needed.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Advice on studying forensic psychology. Please help! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I used to be a forensic psychology student in university and then went on to study other subjects but I have become interested in pursuing forensic psychology once again. I have been on hiatus from education in general for a little over two years and am in need of any advice or opinions on forensic psychology studies. I am also curious about the current financial and economic advantages and/or disadvantages of going into forensic psychology as it has been over 5 years since I was last a student in that subject. Are there better alternatives to forensic psychology (e.g., social work, etc) that may be more beneficial to me as far as a career goes?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He is in university studying physics and geology which requires a very large book load and on top of that he tours a lot with his band. I'm also searching for a new psychiatrist because the one I currently have doesn't seem to care too much. I have such a hard time articulating to him exactly what it's like to be bipolar because so much of it is illogical and irrationalsomething someone who is free of mental illness has a hard time comprehending. I'm at a loss.  </TEXT>
