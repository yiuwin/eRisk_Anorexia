	<TITLE> Squatting barefoot </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I don't own any weightlifting shoes, and my cheap-ass sneakers are the WORST. And I don't really want to spend a lot of money on special shoes (16 year old). So I have been squatting barefoot since I started lifting (two months ago). Is this OK? Or should I really buy weightlifting shoes?

 I got my squat 1rm (estimated from 5 reps) up to 1.8 BW, if that matters.

	<TEXT> There is no 'diet' you should follow. Just eat healthy foods. You will only lose fat in your face if you lose fat overall. But you already have a normal weight, so that won't solve it. I think you are just going to have to learn to live with it. People are different in how their fat is distributed over their body. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can get really strong and muscular with bodyweight training. Just look at Daniel Vadnal from FitnessFAQ's. However, if you do bodyweight only religiously, don't expect much leg development. There are just no bw exercises with which you can really overload your legs to maximize strength and hypertrophy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol, thanks for that. To be honest though I don't like a skeleton at my weight because I am really short. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The researchers also measured hypertrophy in the quads, as mentioned in the article: "The average increase in the 6/week group was almost 10% in the vastus lateralis and nearly 5% in the quadriceps as a whole. In just 12 weeks, that is great progress. The 3/week group did not make significant increases in muscle mass."

You need to get stronger to get bigger. Progressive overload is key. It has been proven that so-called brosplits where you hit your muscles once per week are just sub-optimal for drug-free lifters. You need to train a muscle group at least two times per week.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has been shown that an increase of training frequency, even when volume is matched is more beneficial (http://www.strongerbyscience.com/high-frequency-training-for-a-bigger-total-research-on-highly-trained-norwegian-powerlifters/) . This is only logical: if you distribute the total amount of work, you manage fatigue in a better way and the quality of your sets is higher. 

But there is a point of diminishing returns. Once per week is way better than once per month, and two times per week is a lot better than once per week. But three times per week is not that much better than two times. Ultimately, you have to find a frequency that allows the most volume per week (as this is more important than frequency). It's the total amount of work that matters the most.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everybody!

Training history: couple of months of calisthenics, followed by weight training for 2 months of weight training. Reached intermediate strength levels (according to multiple comparison sites).

Age: 16

Height: 5'5''

Weight: 128 lbs

Bodyfat percentage: 12% (measured by a scale and estimated by myself, can post pics)

Goals: functional hypertrophy and strength, while keeping conditioning levels.

The program:

**Day 1 (Intensity day, long rests, RPE: 8-9)**
A1. Bulgarian split squats 4x 6-10
 (I have a large leg imbalance)

B1. Weighted pull up 5x4

B2. Bench press 5x5

C. Calf raises 3x8-10

**Day 2. (shorter rests, lower weights, RPE: 7-8)**
A1. Dumbell clean and press 3x 810 
A2. Dubbel row 3x 8-10

B1. Kettlebell swing 3x10 
B2. Farmers carry 3x 
B3. Med ball squats + overhead throw 3x 10

C1. Dumbell curl 2x 6-10 C2. Overhead tricep extension 2x 6-10

D1. Calf raises 3x10

**Day 4 (RPE:8-9)**

A1. Bulgarian split squats 4x 6-10 A2. Bench press 4x 6-10

B. EMOM pull ups: 3 pull-ups every minute for the first 5 minutes, then 2 pull-ups for the last 5 minutes.

C1. Face pulls 4x 8-12 C2. EZ-bar curls 3x 6-8

D1. Lateral raise 3x 8-12 D2. Farmers carry x3

**Day 5:**
OPTIONAL: Sprint, core

**Day 6 (RPE: 7-9)**

A1. Trap bar deadlift 4x6-10 

B1. Incline dumbbell press 3x6-10 

C. Prowler pushes and pulls (optional) 

D1. Dumbell curl 2x10-12

 D2. Overhead tricep extensions 2x 10-12

So for each exercise I have a rep bracket. Once I get to a certain amount of reps, I increase the weights and then work up again. For the pull ups, I follow this program from T-nation (the 10+ one). The volume on this routine is not that high. Over the course of the week I will add sets to the accesory exercises The whole mesocycle will look something like this: 

Week 1: introductory, minimal failure, moderate volume) 

Week 2: increase reps within rep brackets 

Week 3: add sets to accessory movements 

Week 4: close to or to failure 

Week 5: Deload </TEXT>
