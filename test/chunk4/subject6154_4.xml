Disagree with this assessment. His name helped it attract *initial* attention - but the movie succeeded because it was FUCKING GOOD.

It's easily the superior film (with gorgeous cinematography thanks to Deakins) and possibly my favorite in the entire franchise. "Spectre" meanwhile just sort of languishes along with a poor villain (wasted opportunity that was) - and no great action for the entire middle hour.

Honestly, who knows? Never quite understood what makes certain SubReddits succeed where others fail. I do like the idea of a view/sub requirement though; would weed out a LOT of the elementary questions / threads.

/r/LetsPlay is (usually) an excellent community/sub though - genre-specific, but covers a lot of basic YouTube stuff better than most YouTube-related groups. Like here though, you get new users asking dumb questions, and others outright refuting /ignoring the proven advice from larger guys like myself. Which can be frustrating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The payout date is entirely irrelevant. 

Although you're missing out on revenue while the channel is down (sorry to hear that, BTW) - you'll get every penny owed to you up to the point the channel was suspended, in addition to every penny as soon as you re-start the channel.

Nothing to worry about (except appealing those strikes). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Blindspot is horrible. I'm honestly ashamed it's doing so well. 

I gave up after episode 3 when one of the characters (in the FBI) had to explain to another character (in the CIA) the differences between their agencies, and how one "operates domestically". No shit?

The writing was just SO dumbed-down and procedurally-formulaic.  </TEXT>

Besides, in 2008, etc, there weren't many other ways to earn money. Merchandise has never sold particularly well, and sponsorships just weren't negotiated regularly enough to be dependable. But, still, I've made tens of thousands on non-YouTube sources, it just wasn't a consistent thing I focused on until the past couple years.

And yes, RPM rates used to be about 4x what they are now, at least for my channels. </TEXT>

It's not like his videos are overly complicated or anything. Plus, they're mostly shot/edited in-sequence. Few cutaways to b-roll, either - so I'm curious as to your confusion.
