	<TEXT> Oh man, your message was chock full of great advice.  I got an appointment with the Mayo Clinic at my own doing, so that's one check mark. All the information is in my name and under my email and cell phone which are both locked with passwords Nparents don't know. I currently don't have a job, so I can't get another phone right now. The university couldn't accommodate me further, so I'm going to a local uni for my AA. I actually chatted with my therapist about this today: I will have scars. I can't build healthy relationships right now, and that's okay. Someday, I will be free.

Thank you SO much for that answer. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The other day, I wondered aloud why my dog (black lab) looks sad sometimes. If any of you have dogs, you may know the look I'm talking about. I'm sorry it's so hard to explain. Nsister replies with, "Why do you have a resting bitch face?" I was somewhat taken aback by this, but at this point it's kind of expected. She gave me a smirk and walked away. I voiced to Nmom that what my sister said was hurtful. She replied with "you need to stop being so sensitive". The discussion then turned to how I provoke my Nsister into saying the things she does because I overreact to things she says and am overly sensitive.  

The other day, Nmom and I were at the store. She was looking at meat, so I went to look at cereal. She said okay and we agreed to meet up in the next aisle. I met Nmom back in the aisle. She then started on about how she can't get what she wants from the cereal aisle because I wouldn't wait for her. I said I was sorry and she kept telling me that I didn't care about what she wanted or needed. She started to yell at me (we can just leave the groceries at the store, i'm ungrateful, etc) and everyone around us started to look at us. We eventually finished up shopping but it was really tense. 

I've been suspicious of a possible peeping Tom outside my bedroom. There's been beer cans, soda bottles, and candy wrappers. Our neighbor's son is the most likely person right now. He walks through our backyard occasionally, startes at me while I'm outside. It's been about a month of this and Ndad is finally taking it seriously. He works in public and private protection and brought it up with his coworkers. So yesterday, he decided to go to the neighbor's house and tell them he wants to get police involved.  They kind of brushed it off, then his parents left. After that, the son walked through the backyard and stared at me through the windows out back. 

I live in a family of bullies and it is the most uncomfortable and volatile situation. I hate being the scapegoat. I hate being blamed for things that I don't do. I'm so stressed out I've been pulling out my eyebrows. I have OCD that I'd started to get under control and all my progress has regressed. I'm so depressed and my anxiety is through the roof. My personal life is a mess. My home life is miserable. I'm just trying to survive until I can move out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I though that back in January. Then he started dating another girl. Granted, she supplies him coke and encourages him that hallucinogens control schizophrenia better than his meds, so it's not too healthy. He almost totally cut me off when they started dating. Last time we talked he seemed like he missed me. Said he was wigging out and needed someone. Who knows. Thanks for the input. Your last sentence describes him pretty well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> what you said couldn't be articulated any better. I agree with everything you've said. if I can get him.to answer his phone, I'm going to talk to him for a while. he's isolated himself and doesn't answer sometimes (which is incredibly worrying to me), but I try to message him every day or two. if anything huge happens soon, I'll make an update.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll preface this with saying I don't use any drugs or alcohol, so this isn't about me  I have a friend I'm really concerned about. the past six months, he'd started using multiple drugs (coke, MDMA, codeine, lean, who knows what else) and got to a point where he couldn't come to school because he'd start having withdrawals. he barely ended up graduating. 

curveball: he's a paranoid schizophrenic. he's not taking his meds regularly. I talked to him the other night. he doesn't look good. he's breathing really shallow, really phlegmy, waxy looking skin. I've had several loved ones die from their addictions. I'm genuinely concerned my friend is on the way to dying. 

I know that I can't make him stop using. he has to want it. I've talked to him about my concerns. I think he wants to die. he's never said it, but he's said some things that concern me. do any of you have any advice for me? do I let him know I'm there for him, but can't watch him fall apart? what do I do? any advice is appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sorry. I can only imagine how frustrating it is for your mother to disregard you for being who you are. do you have a friend you could go with to buy shoes and clothes with that you feel comfortable with? 

I know it probably means nothing coming from a stranger on the Internet, but I'm proud of you for being you. you're very brave for doing that in my eyes. If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm all ears! </TEXT>
