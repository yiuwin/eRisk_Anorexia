	<TEXT> So, I was normally dreaming, but it still had a touch of lucidity as I was doing things that I wouldn't in real life, and I felt as If I wanted to take control, but I just couldn't, It kept sorta going on. Then suddenly I just knew I was in a dream, no RC, no nothing, something just clicked in my brain. From then on, I immediately ran to my friend, shouting "I'M HAVING A LUCID DREAM", and he was really happy for me as well, I then ran over to another group of friends and said the same thing, then they replied with "yes... yes you are" in a really monotone voice, as if I wasn't supposed to know but they gave in to my will power, my other friend who was standing next to me still didn't believe I was in a dream, possibly because he is very critical in real life. So I went into the centre of a mass of people and started spawning lightning everywhere. After that it was like my energy was drained and I felt the dream starting to fizzle out, I tried to stay calm, but I couldn't really help it. I then woke up and now I'm on reddit. Forgot to mention, the technique I used was MILD

Question: I have heard that if you go and tell people in your dream that your in a dream, they will turn evil or something. I had the exact opposite of that, why would they turn evil for other people? 

And another thing, people say their dreams fizzle out if they get too excited, well I got really excited and did stuff for a good half hour, and only at the last point did I feel like it was ending. Why is this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so, yesterday night, something really strange happened to me, I was in a dream(I didn't know at the time), and from here on, this is what happened in the dream; I was talking to my friend about lucid dreaming, and we where joking about me being in a dream right now, I then saw a huge unrealistic monster in front of me, and another person in the dream was looking at it, and doing his/her own RC's, which me and my friend laughed at. So then I did a RC for a joke and started counting my fingers, I started counting my fingers, and just as I finished counting up to 5, I saw a 6th finger, which was when I realised I was dreaming, After that, it felt like the universe was imploding(my subconscious), and I felt that I was becoming aware of my surroundings, and then everything went a pure light grey colour, I couldn't see anything. Then I woke up.

This is just an experience I wanted to share. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is no rule or consistent pattern governing the formation of adjectives ending in -ic and -ical. Some -ic words are preferred over their -ical counterparts (e.g., ironic over ironical), and some ical words are preferred over their -ic counterparts (e.g., metaphorical over metaphoric, alphabetical over alphabetic). Still other -ic and -ical pairs have differentiated over time and now have different meanings. Historic and historical, for instance, have different definitions, as do periodic and periodical, classic and classical, and economic and economical. </TEXT>
