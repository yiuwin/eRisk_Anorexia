	<TEXT> It might be but saying "We deal with that emo shit all the time. Me, Pat, Don C" sounds like Kanye, Plain Pat (hosted Cudi's breakout mixtape and helped manage Cudi and Kanye as well early on) and Don Cannon all deal with Cudi's emoness and might be suggesting they've even talked with each other about it behind the scenes. Gives it a deeper less fake context but still, who knows </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TAMPA, FL  Those individuals who communicate with Kanye West on the daily are in for an uphill battle.

The ever-outspoken rap star, whos currently blitzing throughout the country on his Saint Pablo Tour, totally ignored Travis Scotts latest hit and said goodbye to his phone.

I got rid of my phone so I can have air to create, West tweeted earlier this morning (September 13), a day after he was spotted with his celly backstage at Philips Arena in Atlanta with 2 Chainz, Metro Boomin, Jermaine Dupri and Cap 1.

As an avid tweeter, it can be assumed that Yeezy will keep the Macbook handy to let off his 140-character public service announcements out for the time being. This isnt the first time Kanye has openly admitted that his phone was a distraction. Longtime fans will remember his now infamous blog, KanyeUniverseCity.com, where he revealed that he was traveling the globe without any worry of getting a phone call, as he was completely wireless, including the device in its entirety.

While it remains to see what the absent cell phone will add to Wests discography, the company he keeps appears to be ideal for creative air. Take a look at 2 Chainzs latest encounter with Kanye down below.

For your information, Andre 3000 was there too.

	<TEXT> You make good points and maybe as the show progresses it could show more of that however I don't think so judging by all the interviews etc that Glover has given out. Paper Boi seems really similar to the whole 2005-2016 trap movement with some of the names people give that are double entendres between street terms and non street terms, like OJ da Juiceman, Rich da Kid, Cash Out etc and the time era feels like its specifically about current times as opposed to the Atlanta Outkast grew up in </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was interested in Tidal because of the lossless audio quality but it seems like the other streaming services caught on and offered 320kbps Ogg which is very high quality comparable to FLAC and majority of people cannot tell the difference.. That seemed like the only actual incentive to get Tidal when it was introduced but now it seems like there's no incentive to have Tidal. Maybe there is and I don't know about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMO this is a product of the social media blowup that we are all influenced by, it's hard not to be sometimes. Now we live in an age where all these rappers can release every fleeting thought they have to the world and it gets turned into a headline or passed around Twitter/Facebook/YouTube etc. The world conflates their everyday stream of consciousness opinions with their music. Social media is definitely a detractor for rappers and other artists, it's like they have to use it all the time to stay in the mix of things or people forget about them if their name isn't popping up in their timelines anymore, but then the consequence is that their opinions can put a cloud over their music.

I would bet Tupac Biggie or anyone else would've said some shit on social media that people would be like wtf and it would hurt their image, but back in those days all it was was radio interviews and lyrics so their private thoughts or behind the scenes conversations were hidden from the world and their public image was separate and preserved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe on the 8-10 end because he did do a lot for rap in general and bring a lot of people into it. However if we are talking purely skills and ability probably not. Influence and progressing the genre as a whole, yes. Songs like Lollypop when I went to college everyone was playing that song and it was all over the radio and in all the bars etc. Then he held on to those fans through all that work ethic he had for mixtapes and new releases... and probably brought them even further into the genre when they wanted more but had run through his stuff already. 

During the 2000s I remember pop music went in waves, sometimes it'd be punk rock, sometimes arena rock, sometimes more acoustic stuff, but Wayne ushered in a new long era of hip-hop being a major player in pop mainstream music again. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for this rare Kanye West song </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-02 00:41:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The song is 7+ minutes long, it features a piano background that loops over and over. Kanye is in full autotune mode and it pretty much seems like he was drunk in the studio rapping about anything and everything during it. It was around the time that he was doing GOOD Fridays but I don't think it's on the GOOD Friday full mixtape. It's a very basic song without much work on the sample, kind of upbeat and cheerful. It's a long song very similar to Last Call with the free form lyrics but it was Kanye solo on it and with a lot of autotune rapping. If anyone knows what song this is I've been trying to figure it out for like a week now, but don't remember the title so it's making it more difficult to find it on Wikipedia etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright the melody has been stuck in my head for freaking weeks now but the lyrics are not coming back to me at all. Here's what has come back to me: Blue. Something about Blue that word keeps going off, whether it's in the song or the artist was named that. This song was popular it had a swinging, upbeat tone about it. 

This might be one of the most embarrassing things I've ever done but here is me singing the melody haha

http://vocaroo.com/i/s0ait3BTUOqZ


Also I could be totally wrong about this part, but for some reason that ending part, when the melody changes, in my head the last few words of that part are "So don't come back" or "I don't want you back" or something like that. I am pretty sure it was a breakup song, but the "to hell with you" type, possibly mentioning a cheating man, but now I'm going beyond what I can remember </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many probably have seen this since these are 5 years old now, but the viewcount on the videos are very low, I enjoyed the series a lot and ended up trying the wines because of it (before that I thought it was cool but figured it was a little gimmicky and one of those rich old celebrity type of things to do) after watching it and seeing Steve Reeder's passion for winemaking I gave it a go.

Watched these videos/bought these wines while on vacation at Keuka Lake in the heart of the Finger Lakes wine region. Went down to Water Street liquor store and the owner said to me "You know who's wine this is right? You probably just think it's Dave Matthews right?" before I could even answer he goes "This is Steve Reeder's wine! Guess where he got started? (pointed out the window) "right down down the street there" which was pretty cool </TEXT>

	<TITLE> YouTube could help to solve clickbait titles/thumbnails by only paying out for viewers who watched 60% of the video total. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-22 02:27:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Which also means that if a clickbait video creator tried to build up the end of the video the entire time without having any content at the beginning, a viewer could skip to the end of the video and the creator would not get paid for it. For example if someone tried to do one of those awful lists similar to those on Facebook titled YOU WONT BELIEVE THESE MYSTERIES THAT CANT BE SOLVED JUST WAIT TILL YOU SEE #2, and the viewer realized the rest of the video was garbage, they could click and watch #2 and the creator would not get any revenue.

This would help push people to make compelling content like some channels already do (Channels who already make this type of content for example, h3h3productions, tons of music movies and game reviewers etc would be getting paid out by viewers because people tend to watch those videos especially noticeable if you start reading the statistics page on them) 

Honestly the whole monetization thing with YouTube isn't such a bad thing, it makes total sense, but in its current state it's so incredibly easy to abuse by making clickbait content with really outlandish titles and misleading thumbnails just so that person can get a click. By changing things up a bit it might help cut down on a lot of that nonsense </TEXT>

Two Step --- Halloween to end it, huge! personal favorite part was the You Might Die Trying and the 12 minute Mercy jam N2, so damn smooth.

Also somehow the "Honey Honey" #36 chant got started in the middle of a long Mercy jam. Everyday/#36 weren't even played this night.

For example I noticed over the past few days, several people were selling tickets or looking to buy them in /r/davematthewsband and several were looking to buy/sell here in /r/DMB. There's a chance that not everyone involved with that knew about the other sub and perhaps (or in the future with similar scenarios) those people selling/those buying could have found what they were after with more effectiveness.

Being that /r/DMB is the higher populated subreddit, IMO the easiest solution would be to make /u/maxtrix and /u/TheGreenCouch Full Permission mods on /r/DMB , and having /u/maxtrix set /r/davematthewsband to be a private subreddit, and adding a message on the /r/davematthewsband "This is a Private Subreddit" screen, directing people to go to /r/DMB. 

A proposal to bring us all together and have one main active hub for all things DMB on reddit. What are your guys thoughts on something like this? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems like Blockbuster and all those video rental stores truly died off because movies were no longer being rented, but there really hasn't been a "Netflix for Gaming" that's been successful yet... I remember I had GameTap for awhile but it was the most random older obscure games and it was pretty shoddy IIRC. I've never done GameFly cause I  find the whole mail thing to be not really worth paying for as I'd not use it that often... however a something like a Netflix for Gaming, if it became viable, I could get into that. What do you think of the possibility that we see game renting make a return in the next ~5-10 years as technology progresses and SmartTVs become more common? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> NEO-GEO: The greatest system that never was in the U.S. (Discussion starter about NEO-GEO) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-15 00:33:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Any knowledgeable gamers/gaming historians able to lend some insight into why the NEO-GEO never took off in the U.S.? I was born in the late 80s and between me and my friends, we all either had Genesis or SNES, some leftover NES's around and a few rare kids had the Sega CD before the PSN/Nintendo 64 generation really kicked in. 

I think I can vaguely remember maybe 1 or 2 people throughout my childhood even mentioning a NEO-GEO and IIRC it was followed up with an explanation about what the system was. I never actually got to play one and had never even seen one until I googled it. 

I've been on a big emulator game kick lately and dove into NEO-GEO and I must say, the games kick ASS... the beat-em-ups rule, and the fighting games are cool too. I can't tell if the graphics are actually technologically better than SNES/Genesis or if it's just a difference in the style of the art the developers employed, but things feel a little more detailed and powerful on it than SNES/much more than Genesis. Everything is just way bigger and more blown out than games like Streets of Rage / Golden Axe which I'm more used to seeing. There are several pretty unique  games too and all around it's a lot of fun to play, possibly because it's brand new, but also because there's a different pace/style than the retro games I knew. I love the sports games on it, Baseball Stars 2 is unbelievably addicting for me

Anyone know what it was that stopped NEO-GEO from attaining more mainstream success in the U.S.? Purely business or just by chance, maybe the heavy use of Japanese animation made it feel foreign? Would love to hear anyone who knows about the NEO-GEO if you have any info about it or just want to appreciate the console too.

	<TEXT> I was clicking the random subreddit button on here this morning, checking out various subreddits and I came across one that left a serious impression on me.

/r/ChronicPain is subbed by people who have been diagnosed with long term or lifelong pain. The stuff I was reading over there was brutal. These are people who often were just like any other healthy person until something happened, often unexpected, and they were left to figure out how to cope with it.

While reading this I started empathizing with them and I imagined what it would be like. The thing that got me is how people said the mornings were the worst. Imagine if every single morning you woke back up in that same prison of pain and immediately, no matter how sunny or warm that day was going to be, no matter what you were going to do that day, you are just hit with it every morning. It is seriously enough to make the most sane, reasonable, calm minded person go crazy. There are people over there very vaguely discussing the idea of suicide, saying things like they can definitely understand someone else going through those thoughts because after awhile it's really hard not to have them. 

There are not many of them over there. Less than 10,000. They are fighting hard and they are supporting each other, lifting each other up and giving each other a push or pat on the back. Let's go put another hand on their back and push with them. Cheer someone on or cheer them up, and bring in some fresh new outside light into that place and show people that just because they are suffering from long term chronic pain, they're not alone. We can't expect to ever really know what that feeling is but we can still tell someone how they kick ass and it's pretty badass to fight through what they fight through every day and keep on rolling.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So 2 years ago I was doing a job where I would lift boxes over and over again in the mornings a few times a week. I never had any specific injury or "ouch!" moment from that, but it was around that time that I remember developing muscle knots in my back.

I lost over 100 pounds from ages 20-21-22. I worked out my lower body to the extreme, and did a lot for my shoulders and biceps/triceps but I NEVER worked out my core at all and I've never worked on it in my life. My core has always been very weak and my posture was good for awhile when I lost the weight but it slowly got bad again when I stopped paying close attention to it.

So these muscle knots started to develop, I had an X-ray done with my PCP and he said there was nothing particularly wrong with the results at all. That was around late summer 2014. I don't have pictures of those X-rays unfortunately but I am going to try to get a copy of them ASAP so I can see what it looks like.

I did snap a picture of my current X-ray which I am about to edit this post and add below.

So anyways, I got this back yesterday, sitting in the patient room with the (different from my PCP) back doctor and I specifically said "it really looks like my spine is curved or way out of place" and he sort of just casually said it "looks like scoliosis a bit" as he was having me do the curvature tests. I asked him further about having scoliosis and he changed it to saying that it was a scoliactic curve and more tests like a MRI needed to be done.

He also showed me one taken from my left side, and said that with scoliosis they look for a curve on that angle, but my spine was very straight on that angle.


From what I've looked at online it looks like I do have scoliosis, not as bad as some of the ones I've seen, but certainly not great. I'm not sure what the degrees of my curve is.


Can scoliosis be brought on by an injury that was left untreated? Especially one that I've been trying to deal with without medical help for almost 2 years now?

I still could lose another 30 pounds to get my BMI bracket in place, however at that point my head starts looking huge etc, since for some reason my body seems like it was designed to be stocky or I just developed as an overweight kid for along time. I'm going to do it anyways. Sort of just thinking out loud here... I think the important thing probably is start building some serious core strength. I've been thinking about getting an inversion table or at least a chinup bar so I can hang from it and have the weight of my body get reversed to the arms/shoulders/upper back and fully destress my lower back. I really want to STRAIGTHEN THAT THING BACK OUT but I'm not sure that's even a possibility, from what I read, it's not.

Here's another thing.. ever since I was a kid, let's say for example I am treading water in a pool... if I kick my left leg up, my hip will pop. I've had this happen to me since high school. The specialist guy yesterday also told me my left leg was longer than my right.

So I'm not sure what it is yet, and not really sure what the point of writing this orw hat I'm asking for with it. Just trying to vent somewhere to some people who know what's up with this stuff. Thanks for reading if you did.

Here's another weird thing about my back. It CRACKS all the damn time. I can seriously crack some minor things in there by shifting in my seat a little bit. Once I do some  physical activity and I have "de-inflamed" all of my muscles that are knotting up in there, I can completely crack my back so that ALL of the pain goes away for a moment, it almost feels like a rush of endorphins like I get high from it, but then very very slowly and unnoticeably it will go right back  out of place and starts to cause that pinching, annoying sort of numb pain that causes me to shift around in my seat and not want to put weight on any one part of my body standing/sitting still for any long length of time.

When I took this X-ray I was having a bad day with it and I could literally feel it out of place. I remember having a huge crack a few hours later where it felt like the muscles released certain parts of it back into place afterwards, and I was dying to have another X-ray taken then, but I was already out of the office. It's like I can feel it in there getting unaligned but with a lot of physical activity and loosening up, or a nice hot shower etc, everything can lock back into place, but that moment is unfortunately fleeting and then goes away again.

The next step is getting the MRI and going from there. They're ordering it now, not sure when I get in to have it but hopefully ASAP. </TEXT>

* NEWS: I talked to Rosiebun1 and he said that he wasn't even done sending stuff, asked me to tell him the last file in the DVDs so he could continue to send more when he gets the chance. So I guess this is all just Part 1!

All files right now are heavily 2007-2009 based. I have more 2006 stuff from my own collection to add, and I am hoping that Rosiebun1's next delivery will be the 2010/11 stuff


* [Worst of Anthony Collection](https://archive.org/details/anthonycumia)

* [Worst of Opie Collection](https://archive.org/details/oaopie)

* [Worst of Jim Norton](https://archive.org/details/jimnorton)

* [Worst of Staff, Interns, and Friends (Pat from Moonachie etc.)](https://archive.org/details/oastaffandfriends)

* [Worst of Comedians on O A](https://archive.org/details/PatriceONealGolfIsNotASport)

* [Bombs   Flubs Collection](https://archive.org/details/bombsnflubs)

* Everything that's left waiting to be archived: http://pastebin.com/Y7CJ3Q3j

Coming up today   tomorrow

* [PREVIEW- Studio Guests Collection](http://pastebin.com/XBaZfTQs)

* "O A vs." Collection -- All segments when O A show have a radio feud or any type of feud with another DJ, a guest, another employee etc (Danny hates Nik Carter, Whoopi Goldberg stuff, O A vs. Alex Bennet, Jimmy vs. Don and Mike, Mancow stuff, that kind of stuff in 1 collection)

* A separate video based one for all the videos that were included on them, and more videos that people on here helped me find during that sticky post this winter about the 2006-2009 video archive

Last note: After I started doing all this and got done with the first few, I totally forgot that I had 2 more big folders worth of material that I didn't sift through before making the above collections. Here are the files from those folders:

* [Folder #1](http://pastebin.com/YyLWYzpb)

* [Folder #2 (2011 stuff)](http://pastebin.com/LibQNc6N)


So those are gonna get chopped down and put into their respective categories this week. If there's anything in there you want to hear and its not up on an archive it will be by tonight or tomorrow </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Recommendation: Jeff Who Lives At Home </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-21 14:00:53 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Great movie, highly recommend it. The acting is superb in it, it has a great pacing that makes the dialogue feel just as fast-moving and entertaining as the "action" scenes that are peppered throughout the movie. The movie feels like it moves really fast and keeps you wondering and wanting to know what will happen next. The chemistry between the actors must have been very good off set because it feels really great during the movie, especially Ed Helms and Segel. 

Easy movie to follow but has a lot of themes and symbolic stuff in it IMO about how people carry out their lives, one of the main themes is the concept of idealism vs. realism and where they should/should not intersect. For example, one of the subtle undertones is that Ed Helms' character is constantly scolding or berating his brother on how to live in the real world while he goes out and buys a Porsche way out of his income range, infuriating his wife in the process. The movie doesn't flat out tell you this but one might interpret that Ed Helms character is a total hypocrite, subconsciously trying to create his own little fantasy world just as much as his brother who he looks down on. I took this movie as a sort of a social commentary, anyone out there who soldiered through PHI101 might remember the whole bit of [Plato's Allegory of the Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave), this movie made me think about that again because Jeff comes off like someone who's left the cave and isn't able to get himself back 'in line' while everyone else around him is trying to pull him back, but it's more like a theme in the background to think about rather than a big factor in what the movie is actually about. Even if you don't worry about watching "between the lines" or any of that stuff and just want an entertaining, enjoyable movie to watch that might tug a little at the heartstrings, this is a pretty good one to throw on if it starts raining this weekend. 

I could also very easily see how some might consider the plot a little ridiculous, unrealistic, or not into the ideas of fate or destiny or anything like that, and that could be a turn off for some. Even though I personally enjoyed it and looked past that or suspended my doubts etc, I can see it as being a valid criticism against the movie. 

Overall, if you never caught this movie back when it came out, it's sort of a low key sleeper but totally worth the watch in my opinion.

[Here is a scene without any spoilers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px_Ua27nIdY), showcasing the aforementioned Ed Helms and Jason Segel's onscreen chemistry while they argue in a park.

Unfortunately it's currently [DVD-only on Netflix](http://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Jeff-Who-Lives-at-Home/70208253), it has been on instant in the past though.
