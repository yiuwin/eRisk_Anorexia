It seems like they've slowly taken out all of it so they can "improve" these features but have yet to put just about any of them back in.

	<TEXT> I think the UI needs an overhaul too. It looks very weird and doesnt even work half the time you click it. Also i believe not having precise arm movements is intentional by the devs. I think its just the way the game is. Its supposed to be really hard to accurately throw punches because its a silly couch party game. The characters are just little clay blobs so they are supposed to be really clumcy and hard to control. I do agree with everything else you said though </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea but its kind of more about the principal. That's like saying it's okay to text and drive as long as you're driving a smart car lol. Being distracted by an electronic device is equally as dangerous while driving or walking or riding a wheeled vehicle(skateboards, bicycle, boosted boards). I mean just cause he directly cant cause significant damage riding a skateboard to things other than people doesnt mean that he cant create a chain of events that starts from him being distracted with his camera. What is he swerved and loses control and flies into a active intersection, then two cars going different directions swerve into each other to avoid killing Casey. Than one of the drivers die. Being distracted around cars is the same as being distracted driving a car.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its like nobody on our defense knows how to deal with crosses into the box. They never win headers. If Bendik doesn't get it than theres a 90% chance itll go in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like theres nothing they can really do to reach the top 3. The entire show concept is just not there in context of the show and it really sucks because they are playing their hearts out and working so hard. I've been watching them since day 1 and just waiting for that one change that shoots them up above everyone else but I'm scared that it isnt possible with the show design this year. It just seems so stale and bland, visually speaking. Music wise I think they have the best this year. Man I hope they prove me wrong and pull through with a super big change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me either. I just felt like a lot of people missed the fact that we lost both coaches. Even though one of them might've deserved to go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree, thats why I fear this subreddit will never get picked up even if/when the game gets super big. Mostly because its just a spam subreddit of self promotion. I've tried helping out by putting important info here whenever something new happens but it always seems to get drowned out by random peoples videos of themselves playing the game. </TEXT>
