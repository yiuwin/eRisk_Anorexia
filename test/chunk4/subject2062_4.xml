	<TEXT> Thanks for you indept analysis.  
One time it felt like they had wards, but it could've been just good timing from the Slark that he mised me only by inches with pounce while I was on high ground.  

I know my positioning and my awareness need to better, so thanks for pointing out a few things. If the last one was where Huskar and I were top and the rest was mid, I actually thought Huskar would join me getting to mid and help the team, when he didn't it made me insecure. So yeah should've commited to either one. Alas I wasn't actively trying to steal farm I wanted to push the lane asap to do as much damage with it.

Thanks again for you insight :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First thanks for you assesment :)

I thought it was mostly due to the comb that we won, but I would've thought that we would've won earlier, because Huskar and SB get weaker the long the game goes in my opinion.

So in general it all goes down the way it got, because they didn't play that much better if at all than we and we had the stronger teamfight heroes?

At the 45min I was kind of suprised that they didn't go for T4s, at least one of them should've died.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, this match just happened and I don't know how my team won it. Here is the [dotabuff](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1327827507) to make a little summary. My team had a Veno (me), Earthshaker, Mirana, Spirit Breaker and Huskar against a Slark, Morphling, Slardar, Troll and Ursa. We were behind nearly all the game and didn't think we could win the game late, which we somehow did. I understand that it is hard to push high ground against ES and Veno even more so if one or both have Aghs as it happens to be in the later stages but I feel like they could've ended it at 30-40mins easily.

I would really like some tips on how to be more effective as Veno early and mid, because I felt my impact wasn't that big and only started to really bother them after I got level 2 ult. I maxed the wards first but in hindsight I think getting more levels in Gale would've helped but I don't know.

So any input is much appreciated and if someone watches the whole game, well kudos to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right, however that does not mean that the people who were not born at the time and did not witness it have any right to hold a grudge because of it. They can be pissed about how it's treated, as some people mentioned that it's kind of denied. You see I'm from Germany and Germans did horrible things in WWII, but I wasn't part of that I had nothing to do with it nor could I have prevented it, because I was born after everything was over. I can understand that people who witnessed the horrors of WWII and the genocide are reluctant against Germans, but I can not understand people who did not witness it to be the same. That's bullshit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You seem to have a pretty skewed view of how most organizations function. If the dean saw this first, it would most likely be brushed under the carpet. I see no reason as to why racist views are not called out instantly.

In my experience it works most of the time better. Not as much backlash. However that's my experience and I do not claim that it's always the same, however if they try to hide it you still can publish it. But in my opinion it hurts your cause more if you first publish and then contact them.  
 Although I do agree, publishing the entire e-mail conversation would be the best way to clarify everything.

The thing both sides have to say that's how it went down and I don't see that either happening not matter who of them releases it. This situation will never be really cleared and that's not good for the dude nor for the prof. In my opinion both have lost.

 Also, are you perhaps blind to have not seen the various sources where she apologizes and claims that she made a mistake, while at the same time trying to push the blame back on the student?

I read from her that she said, that she said, that there are females in Europe that are concerned about the situation in India and that she made a generalization and that was bad. That's what I read what she admitted to and apologized for. Which I think is perfectly fine, because something like that can piss of people.

Honestly I don't know who is in the right in this situation and I don't think it'll ever be clear. I'm just sure that both parties are not saying everything and thus I can't make a decision who is in the right and the wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still not 100% sure if it's not taken out of context or if the E-Mail was not edited/faked. What throws me off in the first screenshot of the second E-Mail there is no picture of her but in the second with the "proof" there suddenly is. For me it does not add up. As far as I know and how I experienced it in Google Mail, when the E-Mail is public in their Google+ Account and they have an picture it's shown. So yeah.  
I'm not saying that she did not say it at all, she did say herself that she said the stuff about how she condones the culture in India regarding rape. However I have yet to see any proof or her saying it herself, that she said to him, that she did not take him into her group because he was a male Indian. She herself and the University gave statements which also contradict this whole thing about racism as she (and the university) claim that she has in fact Indian males in her group of students.  
Nontheless I find it quite awful to make that public without informing the proper places first e.g. the Dean and only if they don't seem to react publish it. I think this whole incident is based on miscommunication. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No you are twisting it all around. You are saying Bash is more powerful because it has more programs for it in the "standart" installation. Which is bullshit. Bash alone is not more powerful than Powershell alone. Both need programs for certain dedicated task.  
What I'm saying is that Bash is not more powerful as Powershell, because for complicated tasks you have to write something on your own or use something somone else wrote in one or the other language. Both Powershell itself and Bash are most of the times used to invoke other programs.
And yes even a DOS5.1 with the right programs can be used in the same way as Bash or Powershell, but you know what? DOS is not a shell of any kind, but a complete operating system, while neither Bash nor Powershell are that. They both need a third party kernel, in case of Bash it can be everything in case of Powershell it has to be a modern Windows system. So yeah in that regard Bash is more powerful if you want to say it that way as Powershell. But being an OS DOS is even more powerful than either of Bash or Powershell, but that does not matter here.

If you disregard ALL third party or own written scripts and programs there is little difference in what you can achieve with Powershell or Bash and most of these differences are not really that important. And even if you take all the programs in account the difference is not that big at all. I can understand if people don't want to learn something new because they feel right at home where they are, but I can't stand such bullshit as claiming the linux shell is much more potent than Powershell, heck even the normal Shell of Windows can do nearly all the things you can do with a linux shell, the difference is you don't know the commands, because you never cared to learn them.  
For example one thing I often here falsly claimed by many Linux enthusiasts is that Windows can't do Hardlinks without third party tools, which is utterly bullshit there is the [mklink](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/cc753194(v=ws.10).aspx) command which does just that. Just to give one example.  
I care for neither. I can work and life with both, both have their benefits but also drawbacks. Both have their strength and weaknesses and both have frankly a place. If you don't want to use Windows or Powershell fine, but don't go around claiming it's so much worse than Linux and the Linux shell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Sure, what you can achieve might be the same, but with PS, you end up programming in Visual Basic way too often. 

And on linux you have to program in bash so what is your point? I work with both relativly often. PS at home because I use Windows at home (gaming and such) and at work I use Bash because I work at a Webhoster. It's no different. On Linux I have to program in Bash or SH and on Windows I need to use Visual Basic. I don't have a problem with either.  
And on both systems I can use something like Perl or Python. I don't think the linux Shell is more powerful than Poweshell. I'm okay with either and I can use either, but honestly if I have the choice I use neither but a GUI. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Powershell is basicly just a bash with maybe a few programs like ls added but nothing more. So it's hardly fair to compare the entire GNU/Linux CLI enviorment to just Powershell. If you wanted to do that you would've take the entire Windows CLI enviorment into account to and then they are both quite equal in terms of what you can achieve. </TEXT>

Sorry but no. In any complex program, be it Dota 2 be it something "simple" as a Webbrowser or text processing it's not easy to fix something. Sure in theory it is simple in practice not so much. Why do you think there are still bugs in programs that are being maintained for decades? Sometimes there are bugs where one would think it's easy to fix, however without insight into the code base it self it's easy to claim the fix would be easy, but that does not mean it's easy to implement.  
Honestly in theory nearly every bug in Dota 2 is easy to fix and while some of the time it takes to fix it may not needed, it's not as easy as it often seems to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  BS. This is easy and unless valve shows honesty ( not going to happen) they are just going to coat it with the same ignorance or usual silent fix that issues brought up in the community usually do.

Have you seen the code base? Do you know how all the stuff is written? I bet not, so don't assume they are lazy or whatever. In theory it may be easy, but then again nearly everything is easy in theory, but in pratice it's a lot more complicated.  
I don't know the code base but I think it's safe to assume it's a lot more complicated than just an easy conditional statement.

 I feel like there is a serious lack of efficient management at Valve. There used to be, and they made very well concentrated games. But these new hatteries?

Maybe they are focusing on Source 2? Maybe there are priorities that are way higher, which in my opinion is most likely the cause. I mean let's be honest the bug may be game breaking but I don't think it'll happen that often. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't know who I am, I mean sure I know who I am on the official papers and stuff, but that's not who I am if you understand where I'm coming from. The thing is nobody really knows me neither my friends nor my family, they all know some part of me and a big part of acting so that I'm able to fullfill most of the stuff they see in me.  
For example for my family I'm the stoic kind of guy who doesn't show much emotions and even through he did some mistakes stand up everytime. For one group of my friends I'm the lighthearted but still kind a deepish philosophical guy who loves to educate himself about so many things that he can't keep them straight in his head sometimes, another group of friends sees me as the nerd who just loves to play video games and doesn't do much beside that, he focues on learning stuff about the games he plays to get the maximum out of it.  
While all of them contain something that is true non of them is me and I start to doubt that even I know who I am, because I've played some of these roles for so fucking long that they are more than a part of me, but I always did try to make them as something perfect. I don't know how to properly express is it in English nor in any language I'm capeable speaking in. I just don't really know who I am, sometimes I feel like I'm still the 14yo idiot who is in school, but then sometimes I feel like I'm even older than I really am. I think on top of all that comes that I don't really have any close friends anymore. Either they live way to far away or I just don't have that much contact to them as I used to.

Alle anderen Kalkulationen fhren ebenfalls wenn nicht sogar noch mehr zu Unmut seitens der Fahrgste. Entweder man erhht dann die Ticketpreise so, dass Sie immer die lngst mgliche Fahrt decken, da beschweren sich dann berechtigterweise die Personen, welche das Ticket nicht voll ausnutzen oder man schafft eine extreme Staffelung was dann wieder zu Unsicherheit seitens der Fahrgste fhrt, da diese sich nicht nicht sicher sind welches Ticket genau bentigt wird.

Ich vermute mal stark, dass die Preisfindung und Gestaltung bei PNV alles andere als einfach ist.

  Das Ticket berechtigt zu 90 Minuten fahrt in eine richtung.

Das Ticket berechtigt zur Fahrt von einer Person ber einen gewissen Zeitraum in eine Richtung. Ab einem gewissen Punkt zhlt die Fahrt als beendet und dann darf das Ticket auch nicht weitergegeben werden. Klar ist es schwer bis unmglich es nachzuvollziehen bei einer Kontrolle, aber ich schtze, dass es zumindest in einem dunklem Graubereich liegt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First things first get down from your fucking high horse and don't behave like an asshole.

You don't seem to be able to differentiate between what early access should be and how it actually is used. Also you seem to ignore that the developer have bills to pay and for that they have to earn money which they can't if they have to keep on putting resources into a project that is far from profitable.

No the disclaimer is "this game is in alpha, we are working on it according to this plan and HOPE to fulfill everything" I don't know why people don't get that just because they plan to do something does not mean they will.

I know both the road maps and the end product and as I said it sucks and I regret putting money in it. And DF has made errors no doubt but its not illegal what they did as you fucking claimed several times by calling it theft or breach of contract. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'd be curious to see what your opinion of this whole thing would be had you been on of those Kickstarter backers that fronted up a few thousand as opposed to the $20 it takes to get an Early Access copy of a project.

Easy I don't have that money on easy disposale so I won't spend it on something like that.

 If I pay money for product X, but instead get HALF of product Y that is theft. You are taking my money under false pretense, my money is my property, you are stealing my money and giving me something we have not agreed upon.

True but that does not apply here. You get the product you paid for which was the Early Access itself and the copy of the game. It does however not matter if the game is the way you imagened how it would be when it'll be released. I didn't get all what they planed and hoped for but I got the game and that means I got what I paid for. It may not be what I hoped or wanted it to be in the end, but I got the product I payed for.

With your logic every game that does not keep up with it's promises is  theft. So Watch Dog was theft, AC:U was theft? The difference was that when you bought Spacebase DF-9 you knew the product was not yet finished, you knew that there is the chance that it would not contain the features they planed.

 It's really as simple as that man. If you don't agree with me, I can't really explain it any plainer.

I don't agree with you because it's wrong. Simple as that. I never disagree that DF handled the whole thing wrong, but from a complete business logical viewpoint at that point into all the shit it was the right thing to do. I also believe that the guys at DF would've loved to complete the game, but not at the costs of their jobs or the company. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Generally Kickstarters and Early Access projects have stretch goals or a roadmap depicting a "contract ... (that) specified excatly what you want and what they will give you".

This alone shows me that you seem not to have an understanding on what kickstarter (or other form of crowd funding) is. Yes if they say "you pay $x you'll get the game" then they have to provide you with said game however the game does not have to be excatly what they had planned for. There are many reasons why it may not work. The things they are stateing as the their roadmap is something they aim for and if they can't complete it it's nothing illegal. You are an investor  and nothing else. If they think they won't be able to complete feature X it's up to them to decide so. Sure you can afterwards say that you are dissappointed but you have no legal way in any shape or form to force them to give you feature X.

 The contract IS there, it's just not legal or binding
Then it's not an contract. No discussion needed. 

  There was an agreement, money was paid, and the other end of the bargain was not upheld.
And that is wrong in the eye of the law. The ony agreement you and the developer got into was: "You pay me $n and you get access to the alpha/beta of the game and the full game upon release" All of the things they planned to do where not part of that.

 This is not "business as usual", this is theft. And I do not consider the capital that I use to invest in endeavors to be "learning money" as you put it.

No it's no theft in any way or form. It may suck for you or me or the customer but it's not in any strecht of the imagination theft. They have given out a plan on things they wish they implement in the finished product, but decided to scratch most of them because it was not viable for them as a company to realise them. Happens all the fucking time. 

 If a Kickstarter is not properly funded the money returns to my account and all is well. In Early Access many of them make it clear that "This game is still undergoing development, we are testing things" but there is an understanding that the game is STILL BEING WORKED ON.

The difference is that underestimated how much money was needed or overestimated how much they would made. Bad business practice yes, illegal no. It has been shown time and time again that Tim Schfer is not good with the business side of things.

 Double Fine just put out a hastily built "Final release" and washed their hands of it, giving the community a limited batch of LUA files and turned tail.

No they gave clear and to a degree understandable reasons why they ended development on the game. It was not viable on from a business standpoint. After all companies like DF are still businesses and they need to make money to pay for the stuff they need to be operational, that includes wages. If they don't at least break even with a project it's normal to stop it and that happened with Spacebase DF-9.

 Again, this is THEFT.

Again it's not but if you want to keep claiming that without giving LEGAL proof you just disqualify yourself from any further discussion about it.

And fyi I was "burned" by DF-9 I made the mistake to buy into it. Yeah it annoys me that I don't get the game I hoped for, on the hand m'eh shit happens all the time I have burned money for worse shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another difference between the contractor and a game developer in early access is that the contractor got into a contract with you what specified excatly what you want and what they will give you. However if you or anybody really thinks that early access or any other crowd funding way is anything like that well you are mistaken.

If you are baking a game on kickstarter or buying into the early access you are helping them fund the game. You don't go into a contract with them stating "if you don't fulfill are the planned features for whatever reason I'm able to sue you". That's just bullshit. See it as an investment it may pay off (you get a good game) or it won't (game is shit). It's not that DF did pull the game from steam so you won't be able to play it anymore.

The whole incident did however put a scratch on DFs credibility but you haven't and shouldn't have any legal way to go against them. Just fyi I bought the DF9 EA and yeah I kind of reget it on the other hand I see it as learning money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Your belief in the supernatural is every bit as irrational and crazy as what these people are doing

No, it isn't. Granted believing in a god may not be what most people claim is rational, but not believing is neither, because if it were rational you would have proof that there either is or isn't a god, which you have neither. So it's up to you to decide what is "rational" or more likely the "truth" and everybody has to do it for them selfes. What is important about it is, that you are not to pass judgement on them because they don't believe the same as you do. That's when it starts to get crazy.

Faith is not irrational as long there is no proof to state that it is in fact different from what the faith claims it is. I don't believe in God but I can see that it can be comforting to have such a believe and maybe even the structure of a church. 

  you just don't visibly act it out in this manner so its easier for you to draw an imaginary line and point at them saying, "I'm not like that!"

Because he/she isn't. He does not believe in what they are saying. They are clearly different form the modern version of most christian believes. If they are worse or better I can't tell from what little I know about it. Sure it is kind of silly what they are doing and I don't think there is a reason for it, but hell who am I to judge? What evidence do I have that they are really wrong? After all a bit to think about for you: How do we know that what we percieve als scientific evidence is real and not just imaginery?

So you are getting downvoted because you acting like an asshole and in the way you are not one ounce better than the religous people who claim homosexuallity is something bad, because you seem not to be able to accept that people are different from you in some matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ehm it's a bad decision not offer the option at least. What does it hurt? I mean seriously if you don't need it then you won't use it, but in the "rare" occasion that someone is to loud or quiet you can just ajust the setting, no harm done. 

 You just wouldn't have to do it with mumble.

Only if all people set everything up correct. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How secure and reliable it is usually yes

Well yes and no. Just because something is open source does not mean it's more secure and/or reliable, but it's in theory easier for you to check if it fits your needs and maybe change it so it fits your needs.

  Also open source usually means free.

If you mean free as in free to change, free to use even in a way not intened then yes, that's in the common open source licenses. However if you mean free as in "I don't have to pay a dime", then no, that has nothing to do with the fact that the project is open source or closed source. You could make a open source program which is not free of charge for usage, as long as you provide your customers with the means to acquire a copy of the source and that you don't put on rules to frobid certain usage of the program (e.g. Apples TOS about the nuclear warfare).

Alas the statement of /u/ccdude was right. For the most users it does not matter if a program is open source or closed source. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only one that may be inline with what I sad is 12.1 but in this case I don't think the Presserat would produce a Rge or one of the simmilar ineffective "punishments" they have. Besides even if it is in there my opinion is not based on that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not in the German press code and I don't insist on any code. I've seen similar shit in German news pages and I hate it just as much. It's pointless to mention any descent of any person involved as long as that descent has nothing to do with the case it self, which in the this particular case it has nothing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The nationality of the attackers may be relevant if it explains why no Germans have apologised to the Turkish community for the actions of their fellow countrymen.

Why do they apologise? Did they attack her? No, it were a few persons who happen to be of some special descent nothing more. It was an action of individuals and had nothing to do with the descent of either the attacker or the vicitim. It was not a situation that arose because of cultural differences, it was a situation that arose because the attacker is an asshole.

 It's a very fashionable thing at the moment to believe that since we are all "one family", nationality should never be an issue; but real life doesn't actually work like that, and serious problems have occurred in the past due to a failure to understand very important cultural differences. Race relations in the UK, for example, have been very difficult for this reason: the complete lack of awareness of the tensions that exist between, for example, the various African and Caribbean communities has been a serious issue that has caused a great deal of resentment and actually hampered murder investigations.

That's the thing I'm not saying that nationality or descent does not matter, I'm saying in most cases it does not matter and specially in this case it does not matter. There are cases where it does matter and than it's okay to mention it. If for example the attacker had attacked because she was of Turkish descent than it would be good and okay to mention it otherwise it has no real value.

 It's extremely important to guard against stereotyping; of course it is. But that's not achieved by being "colour-blind".

Please tell how this case does have anything to do with stereotyping? All I can see is maybe a negative stereotyping for the attackers descent and a bit to the girls who were harassed by him. Otherwise it just shows that descent does not matter there are nice and good people everywhere.

 Let's see how this can play out. The victim's name was Tue, which is a Turkish name; so clearly she's Turkish, or of Turkish descent. She was attacked, and died, in Germany. If that's all you know, what conclusion are you likely to jump to? I don't know about you, but to me it would look like a racially-motivated crime, even if I knew the part about how she was trying to save somebody else from a beating. No matter how I might like to believe of myself that I am not a racist, this would inevitably be filed in my brain as an example of German xenophobia. And in this particular case, that would be wrong.

Then YOU have a problem with your thinking. If I would hear something like this without knowing the descent (which btw was the case for me, because I first heard from it in the radio where they didn't mention any descent and only the name) I would think "poor woman and stupid arsehole who did it" and not "ahh that's an good example of xenophobia in Germany". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The people believing that immigrants are bad will only see the descent of the attacker don't really care about her descent, so it does not really help.

In my opionion it doesn't matter if someone is a immigrant or the child of one or whatever as long as that has nothing to do with the item of the news. If it's about nazis attacking immigrants, yeah mention that they are immigrant, because it's important to the news. If it's an asshole who beats somebody up, then don't mention if the person if German, Turkish, British or what ever the fuck, because he is an asshole regardless where he or his parents came from. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The right winged people will not care about it, they will see that the attackers were from a different descent than German and use that not that she was Turkish.

Well if it's just to show them it may be relevant for them it should be enough to state it once in the tile. Also why is the descent of the attacker mentioned? Does that matter in any form? Also is it so strange that people from different descents come togehter over something that is a tragedy? Sorry for me it's a bit fishy mentioning the descent if it didn't have to do anything with the crime it self. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But it will not work on those people, otherwise they wouldn't even think that people with different descent are bad. If they were open to resonable arguments I strongly believe they wouldn't hate or despise people from another cultural background.

I mean there are assholes and good people everywhere in every society sadly the assholes are often times the ones shoutin the loudest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The title is so bad, why does it matter that she was from Turkish descent? Why does it matter that the girls who she had helped where German? I mean let's be honest it does not fucking matter at all.

What happened to her is tragic and I hope the dude gets a punishment worth his crime, I also hope that the girls who were harassed come forth, but putting the nationality (or descent) of the people involved so prominent is just bad. </TEXT>
