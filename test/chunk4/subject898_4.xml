	<TEXT> As much as Franco has let me down as a director so far, this one has by far the most potential of all his projects. It's got very good screenwriters (wrote 500 Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now), a good cinematographer (the guy who has shot This is the End, Popstar, etc) and has Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg producing for the first time on one of Franco's movies. This a team that has a very good track record, and makes me think this is a different story than the rest of Franco's directorial projects.  </TEXT>
