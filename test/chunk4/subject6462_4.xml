	<TEXT> Are you me?! That's exactly how I felt yesterday. I wasn't even craving foods but still felt like, compelled to binge I suppose? How are you doing today? I was battling the urge this morning but now I feel like I could go a week without eating anything... 

So weird. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a recipe, actually! I found it in the freezer section at my grocery store - the brand is "Golden". They're ok, not great.

Another day of high protein for strength training. I've been trying to stick to 800 but I went over my calorie goal yesterday by 200 and need to make up for it today :( it's hard working in an office where all of the snacks I like are so readily accessible. I'm going to distract myself with gum and work, and hope that my willpower will win out.  </TEXT>
