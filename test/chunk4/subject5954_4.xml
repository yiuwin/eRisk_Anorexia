	<TEXT> I'm looking for the cheapest to cheaper options considering masks (Do not fog/are solid on my head) available for me. I live in Belgium and my local store offered me these when I asked about their masks:

The dye I4 of 110euro
The empire E-flex of 99,95
The empire EVS of 169,95
The valken sly of 89,95

Are those great prices for the masks? Any cheaper masks near me? 
Thank you for any help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am looking to design my own playmat and reach out to some artists or playmat company. Any companies you had great experience with? Any ideas/tips/help, all is appreciated!

(My design has quite some details which I could not do so a DIY project for this is excluded.) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Into Mirkwood - 1 ring but two players? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The Hobbit: On the doorstep; Into Mirkwood scenario 1A states that each player may add 1 copy of  Bilbo's Magic ring into his deck. We are playing with two players but the expansion only provides 1 copy of this card. Is this correct?

In the previous expansion (TH:OverHillandUnder) there's an objective card called Bilbo's Magic Ring. Are we supposed to use that ring also? (That cards ability is different and not as good) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watched all two seasons and this is just my favorite of all-time.
Right now I started reading the manga but I have some questions:

I read the english versions, my local store only sold the first ten but I might be able to order more from them. But is the english translation far behind compared to the originals? Are they also released on a vast schedule, kinda equal to the originals?

What's the best place to order their manga/DVD/books/merch from? (to Europe, Belgium)

They are releasing a limited edition manga including two new anime episodes. Will those be available with english subtitles as well? If so, where could I pre-order those?

Is "The Recipe book" available in english? And anywhere in stock?
(I"ll be trying the recipes on the thread here too!)

Thanks! </TEXT>
