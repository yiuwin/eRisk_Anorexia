	<TEXT> I'm in good terms with my "block" but I honestly want to leave them. They're cool to hang out with but damn they're also the most toxic people I've ever met and I'm one of them. Recently with this semester, I've made new friends with the irregulars in our class. Most of them are planning to advance this summer so I thought I'd join them. You know, a fresh start with new people.  
TLDR: My "tropa" is too toxic so I need a new set of friends. </TEXT>
