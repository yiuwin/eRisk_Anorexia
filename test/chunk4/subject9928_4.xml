	<TEXT> Ne, das ist Quatsch. Ripuarisch nennt sich "Platt", aber das heit ja nicht, dass es das auch wre. Ich verstehe das so, dass Platt das selbe ist wie Niederdeutsch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Turning a blind eye  certainly one of the most common political manuvres there are, and indeed often very necessary. Happens today with the US in regard to Saudi-Arabia, Egypt, Uzbekistan etc., with the EU in regard to the US and Turkey, with many Latin American countries in regard to Venezuela etc. I think that what you call "bad countries" are just the normal case, hence I don't see it as a surprise to ally yourself with one if you have to get allied with anybody at all.

Heh, your support list and mine varies considerably  just out of genuine curiousity, in good spirit: what good is there about Pinochet? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the many different layers of judgement that make me doubt good/bad binarism so much  on a world-wide scale, Castro could have had a positive net worth  from the practical to the abstract: By the humanitarian aid Cuba provided, by the country's shortage-caused ecological innovations, by his achievements of strengthening anti-imperialism (if you're into that kind of thing). On the Cuban scale his record looks bad, of course  but not Nazi-Germany-bad (didn't cause a world war, even if coming close), not Mao-bad (didn't kill 5 7% of his own population), not Stalin-bad (didn't kill % of his own population), I'd say, not even Chvez-bad. This is the main problem with binary good/bad opinions: Too easily you tend to lump all entities labelled as "bad" together. There is, however, such a thing as dictatorships less bad (or worse, of course) than others, and the distinction can be very important. Badness, so to speak, must be a gradual value and not a 1. </TEXT>
