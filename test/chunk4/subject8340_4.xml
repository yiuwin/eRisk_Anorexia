	<TEXT> I second the Rancillio. It's a great intermediate machine that really teaches you the nuances of espresso. Please don't forget the grinder. You can pick up a Rancillio setup for $1000. You can have a professional machine with a shit grinder and it will produce shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find it oddly satisfying that Meg's sol reference to a lemon is an allegory, not only in her pain of jaundice, but to anything relevant in her life. We must come to the obvious conclusion that her last name compels her, either consciously or subconsciously, into transferring descriptions of lemons to anything relevant within her existance.

	<TEXT> I agree. They should have included a caveat of "...on a budget."

When I see $$$, that's an indication of an mid to high end. In an espresso machine, that would be $1500-2500 range. $ would be under $500. </TEXT>
