	<TEXT> And there is no way to change appearance of tabs etc. Themes only change colours and wallpapers on starting page and most of them look even worse than default. Is there any way to change it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that the AIs in Civ 5 BNW is too static for my taste. The wars are rare and most of them last too short. I would like to play a dynamic campaign with epic wars where AIs take massive amount of cities from other AIs. To make WWII or Napoleonic wars scenario possible. I tried Artificial Unintelligence but it doesn't change much. Are there any other mods? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that GNOME is the best looking DE for Linux for now. It's modern, sleek and is very fast to use. Why there are so many people who like old-school DE with outdated start button with categorized menu. I have been using GNOME for a while and after installing essential extensions like Dash to Panel (or Dash to Dock) its very pleasant to use. I really like the keyboard focus workflow, the simplicity of file manager and so on. </TEXT>
