	<TEXT> Sounds like it could be interesting. There's a reasonably large market for predictive/useful data. Your primary concern should be how "unique" your data actually is: it will be difficult for you to break into the market if your data is very similar to something already offered by Quandl, Accern or EventVestor. Otherwise, it's mostly about demonstrating a compelling use-case for your data, and marketing that.

I actually know quite a few people involved with predictive data, both on the buying and selling sides. Feel free to send me an inbox message or an email to contact@subject5155.com and I'll see if I can help you out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, but I don't really understand the focus on the grades themselves. Columbia has a very rigorous admissions process. The admissions process at HLS is even more rigorous: it's extremely difficult and almost purely academic. Then he was even offered *tenure* multiple times at the UChicago Law School, one of the best in the nation. Judging by the tenure offers alone, It's safe to say that Obama proved himself an academic success of the highest order. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair: Reagan graduated from Eureka college in 1932. Grades have inflated immensely since then. Take a look at [this chart](http://www.gradeinflation.com/figure2.gif). The national average GPA back then was about a 2.3, which is a C+. If Reagan graduated with a C (2.0), then you can assume he was roughly an average (perhaps slightly below-average) student. 

Also, there's this line:
 He was elected student body president and led a student revolt against the college president after he tried to cut back the faculty.

That's interesting. </TEXT>

I can assure you that his grades most likely were rather good: transferring is generally much harder than being admitted as a freshman. Then he went on to Harvard Law School, which is one of the most competitive graduate schools *in the world*. For what it's worth, the average admitted student to HLS had roughly a 3.85/4.00 college GPA. </TEXT>

Given the delays I've seen in just about every part of the process over the last few years, I'm a little skeptical. I would be surprised if the _final_ design is revealed in March 2016 -- I'd expect it to be pushed back a few months.

	<TEXT> I've had one. It's a terrible idea. The size of the thing sacrifices the most central idea of Sushi: excellence in moderation. The sushirito I tried neither maintained the structural integrity of the burrito, nor the fine flavors that mark Sushi. However, that's not really surprising. The form of the burrito encourages taking bites that are as big as possible. That's a bad idea for sushi.

This is not to say that a good Sushirito is an impossibility: I think it certainly can be done. But it's hard to do, and it has to be done cleverly. I suspect the all-round low opinions of the sushirito are because the only restaurants that serve sushiritos are gimmicky ones, and as of yet, no serious chef has tried to merge these two cuisines in such an overt way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Some rentals don't allow early termination, so it can be an issue with renting.

Sure, though in that case you're at most going to lose a few months' rent. There is a ceiling on this cost. 

 Even travelling becomes harder because you need to find someone to watch your house in your absence.

 How is this not an issue with renting as well?

If you're renting, and damage is done to the house during your absence (broken pipe, fire, burglary, etc.) then it can get quite expensive, and it's mostly your landlord's problem. If you own the house, it's entirely your problem. (Not to mention: you're not there to fix it! You have to curtail your trip, hire someone to manage the problem, or let it get worse...) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something that nobody else seems to be mentioning is the cost of being tied down to a place. It's subtle and hard to quantify, but owning a house makes it much harder to move to another city for work or other opportunities, because you have to manage the hurdle of selling or renting out your house. Even travelling becomes harder because you need to find someone to watch your house in your absence.

I think owning a house as a primary residence can have a rather large quality-of-life cost by greatly decreasing your mobility. 

Beyond that, there's a compounding effect: owning a house usually means that you'll buy lots of house-specific items (decoration, tools, etc.). Generally, it encourages the accumulation of *stuff*, which is financially expensive and further ties you to your house. I've heard people say the following phrases:

* I can't go on vacation! I've got way too much stuff in my house. What if someone breaks in or it burns down?

* I can't move to new city, even though the opportunities there are great. The rent in new city is expensive and I couldn't get a place big enough for my stuff!

* I can't sell my house! I don't know what I would do with all my things. I need to keep my house for storage. </TEXT>

If a 12-year-old uses the word "veracity," I might be momentarily impressed. But if a 20-year-old uses it, I'm not impressed, it's just ordinary.

	<TEXT> Please be more concrete about your "ties". Having citizenship or permanent residency in country X can be useful. Having an uncle who lives there is a "tie", but probably useless. 

As I see it, there are basically three things to think about:

1. Taxes. Please consult a tax lawyer. It might cost some money, but the sooner you do it, the better. The US is one of only two countries in the world that taxes its citizens' global income, regardless of place of residence. This can lead to some issues. There are generally treaties in place to prevent double taxation, but they're often quite complicated.

2. Incorporating. You need to get an understanding of incorporating companies in these countries. Each has differing regulations and procedures. You can see the effects of such differences in the outcomes they produce: London is a hub for international finance and wealthy private clients due to the way British banking regulation is set up. The US produces an enormous quantity of innovative software companies, because the legal process to start a business takes about fifteen minutes. 

    It's useful to know the basics and distinguishing components of incorporating in each of these three countries **not only** because you might want to start a business. The other big reason to know about this stuff is that you may, at some point, be in a position where it could be advantageous to create a corporate vehicle to manage property, investments, or trusts for your children. Regardless of where you currently stand in life, this point could be today. Don't put off learning about ways in which incorporating can be useful to you.

3. Finally, consider social security, retirement programs, etc. You've already touched on those in your post, so I won't elaborate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep! I thought about buying a Millenium Falcon set about four years ago, when they were $800 and I had a brief, nostalgia-fueled interest in Lego. I decided not to. Now I'm kicking myself :-)

The downside of the unopened collectible sets is that they're highly illiquid. The market offers a nice margin, but that's because these sets are traded in very low volume. If you have enough sets to constitute a serious investment, then you'll probably crash the market if you ever try to sell them off -- so you'd need to carefully plan your exit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The same question has been asked about comic books and postage stamps.

Such "investments" in collectibles and memoribilia are usually fads with a heavy nostalgia element: the people who grew up with these items finally have the money to buy what they always wanted. The generation of their children, however, may not care much for these items. Naturally, this doesn't create a sustainable market. Investing in LEGO is only smart in hindsight, and you would've needed to start some twenty years ago. Investing in LEGO today doesn't seem like a good move to me. (Especially as 3D printing and injection molding becomes progressively more accessible to amateurs, it is likely that counterfeiting will sink the prices of the most expensive/desirable bricks and lego sets.)

Finally, suppose you make your investment in LEGO and buy a bunch of 2x2 bricks. I hear the going rate is about 10 cents per brick. A 2x2 brick weighs about 1.15g, and to the best of my understanding has measurements [16mm x 16mm x 9.6mm](http://www.robertcailliau.eu/Lego/Dimensions/zMeasurements-en.xhtml), equal to approximately 0.0000025 cubic meters. Suppose you want to invest $100k. That requires a million bricks, which will weigh 1150 kg and take up 2.5 cubic meters. Storing that is going to be annoying.

Perhaps most critically, your investment would be extremely illiquid. I expect that it would be remarkably difficult to sell off a million bricks within a reasonable timeframe without giving a massive discount (which in turn would bite heavily into your profit margin).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  how true is it that 50% of the country is republican? I've seen this taken as truth and I'm wondering if there's any polling behind this 

It's tough to get an exact figure, but as of a 2010 Gallup poll, 31% of Americans identified as Democrats, 29% as Republicans, and 38% as independents. More American independents leaned to the Republican Party when compared to the Democratic Party.

 also I'm not totally following why the drop in pro-life support is to be expected based on your numbers?

Because people don't always develop their own positions on issues, but rather adopt the positions of the group they identify with. That's especially the case if identifying with that group is very personally important to them -- so they conform to the group. For example, if you don't really have an opinion on issue X, but you're politically very much on board with a particular group, you might follow the group when asked to vote on the issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Millennials have also been divided on abortion rights

The graph shows millenial support for the position "abortion should (almost always) be illegal" fall from 47.5 to 37.5% over the last ten years. I don't think that's particularly divided -- it's to be expected, since roughly 70% of the country is Christian and roughly 50% of the country is republican, and the "pro-life" position is common doctrine among both.

The leading phrase of the article, "Politicians ignore them at their peril" seems problematic. Not only did the article not substantiate the claim that politicians are ignoring millenials, but it's also patently false. Bernie Sanders is definitely going for the young vote -- and I think Donald Trump is, too: Trump's platform on immigration is effectively promising less competition to disenfranchised workers, many of whom are not particularly conservative, but rather young and less educated.

	<TEXT> Your choices of font, jewel, and background render are pretty good. I can immediately tell what the logo design is for, and it scales reasonably well.

However, the stroke in cyan (looks like an outer glow set to 100%?) toward the top is unclean and potentially even makes the text harder to read. That should be faded or a little bit blurred -- the jaggedness doesn't come off well. Fix that and you'll have done a nice job.

General advice: whenever using a nonstandard font, think carefully about readability (and how this is impacted by glows, strokes, etc.). 

Finally: I'd suggest making the TM a little less apparent -- maybe move it back a layer, lower the opacity, etc?  </TEXT>

I wasn't arguing that Blu-Ray failed, but merely that it was said to become the next big thing -- and then didn't. BR has fine technical merit, but it (and its general class of devices) simply became obsolete.   By way of analogy, consider the best dumbphones of 2012: they were technically fine -- certainly better than the ones that came before -- but didn't sell well because the market had shifted to smartphones. </TEXT>

The outcome of this? Great variance among the quality of blog posts.

Why does Seeking Alpha not curate their content more carefully? Because they make money from ads, and more articles = more search results linking back to SA = more page impressions = more ad revenue. Beyond that, there's a honeymoon effect to news articles: people will keep coming back to a site even if only 1 in 10 articles is good. (Hello, Reddit!) The bad ones you stop reading after a few seconds, the good ones you're impressed by for minutes. You keep coming back in the hopes of occasionally reading a worthwhile article.
