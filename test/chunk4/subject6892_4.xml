	<TEXT> One thing I noticed is the lack of reviews. No major gaming press site has released a review as of yet. 

One factor might be that the game is hard, huge and doesn't tell you where to go so it's taking a while.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lack of Hollow Knight coverage </TITLE>

	<TEXT> TL;DR - souls-like metroidvania gets released at an unfortunate time

So as a few of you might know Hollow Knight has been released at a really unfortunate time, right along Horizon Zero Dawn, the Switch and Breath of the Wild.

I think it's a shame cause the game is phenomenal.

Here's the release trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAO2urG23S4

I think it's a shame the game is getting so little coverage so I wanted to try and start a discussion on what the devs could've done or do to promote the game more. Different release date would be my suggestion.

What do you think and also what do you think of the game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't know how many review copies the developer sent out and when. This is an incredibly large, slow-paced (when it comes to upgrades) and difficult game. 

Think it's gonna take some time for anyone to do a complete run. 

The game is fantastic but if you push past an hour without breaks it can get pretty tiresome.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sto se tice ukusa je jeben, ali najveca razlika od njih i nase ekipe je iksustvo. Louis je vec u svojim 20ima pisao za Conan dok je Bill Burr krenuo s 18 (ovo nisam sigguran 100%). Louis je 49, a Bill 48. Obojica imaju skoro 30 godina staza s tim da rade u televiziji, radiju i filmovima. Obojica imaju svoje serije. 

Nas najstariji komicar je Pedja, ali on ima jedva 10 godina staza. Lajnap ekipa isto tako. 

Zato sam jako optimistican sto se tice moguceg rasta scene u HR. Sto vise iskustva to bolje.  </TEXT>

b) ak si gledao preko interneta cini se dosta cringe 

c) uzivo je dobro ili okay 

Volio bih raditi na razvoju i rastu stand-up scene generalno u Hrvatskoj, a vec ima dosta ljudi koji se time bave i ide im. Dobri primjeri su Lajnap ekipa (tampar, Goc, Aleks, Koza) i Pedja Bajovi. 

Ima puno mjesta za rast, tak da bi volio vidjeti misljenja opet za nekih 2-3 godine. Primjerice mi nemamo nikakve booking agencije niti promotere. Zasad sav taj posao ovisi o komicaru. Industrija zasad nije toliko jaka (cast iznimkama).  </TEXT>

Veinu posla e morati sam/sama raditi to se tie terapije. Dobit e par savjeta. Neki dobri, a neki malo manje korisni. 
Oni sami priznaju da ne rade dovoljno dugo sa studentima jer imaju mal budget, ali voljni su pomoi i sasluati te uputiti nekom profesionalcu ako ti treba konkretna pomo (psihijatar).

CBT je super pod uvjetom da ju prakticira. Moe se puno obrazovati o tome online. Najbolje je raditi s psihologom i rei mu to planira samostalno raditi.

Ako ode doktrou i preporui ti anksiolitike rae nemoj jer za razliku od antidepresiva mogu izazvati ovisnost.  

Preporuio bi meditiranje, djeluje sporo, ali mi je uvjerljivo najvie pomoglo sa anksioznosti. Drugo najbolje je tranje, a onda bilo kakav drugi sport. Osobno preferiram teretanu.

	<TEXT> I met the dude at DotAPit in Split this year and it saddens me to see him getting all this shit thrown at him. 

He may not be the best DotA personality but he was very nice to us and other people at the event. 

Dude seemed super sincere.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hypothetical question - Ogre Magi core/carry (pubs only) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-06 20:26:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> TL;DR - I want to play Ogre Magi core but at the same time I don't want to be completely useless and ruin my team's fun 

I think it would be fun to run Ogre Magi as a core/carry in pub games. Obviously there are better carries to chose from but this seems like something fun I would like to try out. 

We're talking low pubs, something between 3.3 - 3.8k MMR. 

The idea is to run him offlane with a support and let the offlaner have solo safelane (say Timber or Bristle). 
Think Venge would be a really good combo with the attack damage aura to combine with his tankiness early game. I'm wondering what the best support (specifically to make Ogre lane easier) would be. 

Item build is still a question. Was thinking of trying to Vanguard first and after that to chose between Desolator, Battlefury, S Y and then maybe a Basher. 

Itemisation is my biggest problem. I have no idea what to take early, mid and especially late game.

Aging like a president and 'fuck my dad' had me laughing alot. 
Seemed to me like you really got confident on stage round the 3 min mark, my suggestion would be to try to open like that already - you obviously have the material for it so you can feel good about starting strong. 

Hope that helps.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the Pixar book they discuss how they had to train employees to not take criticism of an idea personally during idea pitch meetings. 

They had to take extra time to educate everyone and I think it took like a year to show results. 

Point being, even though you might criticize something a person said, rather than criticizing the person themselves, it takes a lot of effort for someone to realize it wasn't personal.

	<TEXT> Hello everyone, don't know how many will see this. 

So it seems as people like these comics. Even the last ones:
http://i.imgur.com/Jdy9qZr.jpg

And this one: http://i.imgur.com/Kq7jrVy.jpg



I'll probably do more in the future. Currently I don't have any site where I upload these other than imgur, I'm not familiar with running a site or using one to host comics. 

I won't be uploading regularly but I'll be publishing few short comics in a batch and link them here. 

The thing is I have no idea how the inform people that liked the old ones that there's a new update (for now). 

Wanted to say thank you to all the kind words because it made me excited to do more. 

Cheers!  </TEXT>
