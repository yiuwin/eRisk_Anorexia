I mean there's small things- dead expression (which I think was just because of bad photos) and slightly crooked teeth.   But those are minor.    The body shot is the one that had me puzzled.  It's obvious you were going for sexy, but the whole thing kind of looks goofy.  Again, I think it's just the photos.  Also i don't think it's the skin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd settle for any visible presence.  

Yes, this sub is one giant circle jerk.  I equate it to that old website hot or not.  The only reason I come here is because it's mindless entertainment to pass pointless judgement.  

To be fair in response to your comment about the people who visit the sub.  All we've seen is absent mods come back and tell us this sub is a cesspool we're the problem.  You know what would help?  Moderation.  

And actually seeing mods post in other subs from time to time, I think, is very effective.  Whether or not you roll like something is irrelevant to it's effectiveness. </TEXT>

I know people are going to be dicks anyway, but a quick stamp of *BAM* "Not in my fucking house" would deter it some.  I know when I offered to help, it was because of the umpteenth horrid comment I had read.  And I was like "Well I could have just deleted that right there before it spawned other hateful comments".  Because it does spread quickly from what I've seen.  People get bolder when they see nothing happened to someone else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A cursory search of the posts will show pretty toxic people.  I think people are used to seeing the mods actually post when the moderate from time to time.  It's like when we see something like (example;not to be taken seriously) "Jesus it looks like your face was on fire and someone put it out with a chain you cunt".  That seems like it would be inflammatory enough for a mod to step and leave a message showing that stuff like this won't be tolerated.  

There's almost no visible mod activity besides the auto mod thing that went berserk (I might be thinking of the wrong sub).  I personally don't bother reporting anymore because it didn't look like anything was happening.  Especially since this isn't the first thread to the mods and those seemed to be completely ignored.  

Hell when I checked the other day, 2 of the members hadn't shown any activity in a month. </TEXT>
