	<TEXT> Given *Player of Games* has been mentioned a few times already, it shall be near the top of my list. Blindsight as well. 

Fantasy and politics has worked quite well in the past, so I'll check out *The Gap Cycle* sometime. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If memory serves me right, the series was picked up by Frank's son after he passed away? 

This is a series I'll save until summer if it might require some trudging through. The advice will definitely be kept in mind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds quite fun. My father's interested in Hindu mythology so this is something I can recommend to him as well. Much appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Complex and dense is definitely something which piques my interest, especially if its a potential foundation to an entire course (similar to Godel Escher Bach, though that probably isn't considered sci-fi).

Will look into buying it sometime in the next few days.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, a highschool English teacher gave me her 25th anniversary copy of Dune. Tried reading it 2-3 times but kept getting distracted by something else. But if it's as great as people make it out to be, it'll likely be much more appreciated if I get to it after reading other sci-fi books. 

Would you say to read the sequels as well?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Will look into these after class. Started Rainbow's End before leaving for university but never got around to continuing. It was intriguing for sure. 

And instead of 'bleak', do any of these accentuate/demonstrate the *depravity* of the universe/it's inhabitants? 

The list itself is much appreciated, thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Blindsight definitely sounds interesting, it's [for now] at the forefront of what I'll be reading. 

I read Ender's Game a fair few years back. Wasn't too big on it at the time, but supposedly Speaker for the Dead changes tone quite a bit?

Gonna keep my eyes on the Culture series for later. Unfortunately, because of uni I don't have enough time to read into a potentially-10-book-series. 

Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A Fire Upon the Deep is laying somewhere at home (I'm away at university right now). Will give it a shot when back, thanks!  </TEXT>
