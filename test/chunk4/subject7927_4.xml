	<TEXT> OKAY Sorry for keeping everyone waiting!!!

Just to bring everyone up to date, Gramma fell and hurt her hip a few weeks ago so she is just recovering from it right now.. She is doing great but we figured it would be okay to wait a little bit so she could be a little stronger for the big surprise! 


Gramma Rose will be getting her cards this weekend so just a few more days .. more cards are still coming in the mail which is incredible!
You have all been such an amazing help this wouldn't be possible without you, here's a new news clip that was on this weekend...
