	<TEXT> It was the Season 6 episode before the finale, I believe. Bianca was doing some sort of red carpet interview thing? Or a photoshoot? My memory is fuzzy there, but I'm pretty sure it was that season and near the end of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can someone explain this to me? 

Is the person's phone hacked to prevent them from saying mean shit? Is it supposed to be a commentary on saying what we really mean?

I'm just confused because my understanding of "Not Delivered" means that there was a technical error, so the tone change at the end makes me think it has something to do with that, which obviously makes no sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have to say I agree. 

I was on board with the message, a little skeptical of the execution, but still interested in where they would take the story from here. Those last two spreads just came out of nowhere, and told me everything I needed to know.

I know this is not a new concept, but it's 2017 for god's sake. Don't the teenage boys of the world have anywhere else to look at bewbs than a shonen magazine? Like the internet?

edit: Also "The Sleeping Beauty of the Literary Forest." Okay, that's a big ass nickname. I would be surprised if anyone actually used it. </TEXT>
