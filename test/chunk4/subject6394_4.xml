	<TEXT> I agree with you, but I need to feel like I'm working towards a long-term plan in my chosen career while I'm traveling. If it comes down to taking a calculated risk, though, I'll do that. 

Also: checked your post history. I'm an INTJ too.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Traveling internationally as a journalist </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm 25, in my first real news reporter job at a small Midwest paper. Once my lease is up in November, I'll have been here for 14 months  18 including freelance work for them  and may stay longer. 

But here it comes: I've never traveled.

I've heard everyone's input on this. My military buddy went overseas and saw sunsets on the other side of the world before coming back home with a lethargic shrug to it all. 

I don't cry over sunsets, but I need to travel. 

"You're on the right path," a girl I know told me. "Eventually you'll move on, and this is looking good on a resume. You'll feel better once you move on to another job." 

I care tons about my resume, but I need to travel. 

"Your problems don't go away when you move to another country," my parents said. "This place is better than you think." 

I'll take my problems with me, but I need to travel. 

I'm starting to seethe every time I hear about someone's experience outside of the country. A two-week vacation to Italy in three years after I catch up on student loans isn't going to cut it. I need to see and experience other cultures long-term.

How long-term depends. Maybe a few years will do it. 

The issue is my ignorance beyond this Midwest bubble  the first steps to earning an income a world away. What I have is seven months in a small-town news market with an online presence that's somehow regressed since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Rural land has rich soil for digging deep into stories, but it's uncomfortably far away from an actual pulse. 

I've tried learning about a few ways. 

* A friend suggested teaching English in some "easy" place in southeast Asia  Korea, Thailand. That's great, but I don't want to give up journalism. 

* Travel journalism? Considering I'm lucky enough to land an actual good gig, I'm not feeling the Stepford vibe I get from those bloggers with trophy Instagram accounts. 

* Foreign correspondent? No foreign languages, which is a lack of foresight on my part. I don't know how long the queue is for covering areas that may get me blown up or beheaded, but I have a fine strand of caution threaded through this quarter-life crisis. 

* Freelancing? A possibility, but I'd have to hone my niche and build a client base. If I could travel through volunteer work and earn enough to pay my student loans, I'd be set. 

Am I being unrealistic? 

I love my job right now, but eventually I need to travel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of funny considering how university is still basically extended childhood in so many scenarios. 

The only people to react that way to community college would probably be 19 years old, or older and without a realistic view on things.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What is a good diet meant to help mental energy and focus? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My college diet was adderall and cheeseburgers. 

No meds now, for personal reasons. I'm 25, in a career I love that I need to bring my "A game" to everyday. Mental sluggishness isn't an option, and I've noticed that not taking adequate care of myself has affected my work performance. 

I've began running in the mornings and meditating before work, in addition to getting enough sleep. What are some good, cheap, healthy meals I can pick up after work tomorrow to begin improving my mental focus and energy during the day? 

Despite not making much, I've spent an embarrassing amount on fast food and other ridiculous bullshit. So anything recommended will be better for my budget.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Through a series of circumstances, I currently have a brand new Google Nexus 5X and Samsung J3. I'm going to keep one of them. Which one do I keep? 

What's a cool thing to do with the other one, besides sell it? Install a custom ROM?  </TEXT>
