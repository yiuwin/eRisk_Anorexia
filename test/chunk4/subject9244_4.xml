Maybe he's evolved his style as society has become more socially conscious over the last 5-10 years or so, but the constant flirting was a bit of a distraction at least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See, this here is 2016, where an athletic big having nice post-up skills is barely more important than a point  guard possessing the same ones. Andre's most important offensive aspect, by a mile, is being a PNR threat. Along with that his main priority as a player is being a defensive force/rim protector (has a long way to go there).

There are about fifteen aspects more important to the Pistons offense, or any theoretical NBA offense in 2016, than an Andre Drummond-type having post-up skills.

The Pistons and SVG have been trying to wean Andre off his post-up affinity for some time now. Stan drops subtle references pretty often. But Andre's Andre, he wants his touches, just like Dwight did, and he's getting the max, so it's hard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a very misleading 19-and-10; he didn't play well. He's played quite poorly since returning, a little more than expected perhaps. Not to say there's anything terribly wrong with that, but that plus the losing has shined a light on the difference between he and Ish, at least in the eyes of the players, I think.

In other words, Reggie is a very good offensive player when he's on, but he's probably not the most fun PG to play with if you're his teammates, unlike Ish. If you're winning that's fine, but if you're losing, well, frustrations like these make some sense. In an ideal world I think they'd like Reggie to score and play the 1-5 PNR like he usually does, but also distribute and move the ball a bit more. We'll see if he's capable of doing that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Judging from this:
In fairness, that lineup even before Reggie came back, the starting lineup with Ish (Smith) was outscored by opponents, too. Not by as much, but by opponents so that has not been as good a lineup. We were surviving because our bench was basically coming in and outplaying people. Our starting lineup has not been as good as it should be, its not as good as it was a year ago, certainly. We have to look at some things.

...I'm thinking the most likely move is Jon Leuer entering the starting lineup for either Marcus Morris or Tobias Harris at the PF spot. The Pistons haven't played very well with Morris and Harris paired at the forward spots so far this season; lineups with Leuer at the 4 have been quite a bit better. Leuer and Harris with the starters has been a very good lineup, I know. (it's their 3rd- or 4th-most used lineup) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Finally getting around to ***The Sopranos***: I was immediately surprised at its relative lightness of both tone as well as shots, at least compared to the deluge of serious prestige dramas recently. I can actually see things (oh hey, *Mr. Robot*); there are jokes and a nice mix of broad-ish characters. I planned on pairing the show with some old Sepinwall (or similar) recaps, but I guess I ain't got time for that. I'm in the middle of the second season, both of which have hooked me more as they progressed.

P.S. I can't fucking stand Tony's mother </TEXT>

I'd disagree there. I think a lot of people remember Reggie the All-Star candidate of the first half of last season and forget his second half. He's good, but he's no Isaiah Thomas, for instance, I don't think. </TEXT>
