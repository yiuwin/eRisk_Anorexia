	<TEXT> I was doing it with dairy, but a redditr told me that maybe that was causing the acne to worse so I cut it two weeks ago, more or less. I eat pork rinds and olives to compensate fat mostly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, maybe this can be useful for somebody. I've been acne free for one week now. I've tried many things and right now my main concern is to loose weight, but I've been suffering with acne break outs for months, finally I start to see some light. I think my skincare routine has helped but mainly diet + supplements:
Diet:
*Keto diet.
*Cutting cheese and dairy.
Supplements:
*Spearmint leaf capsules.
*D-Chyro-Inositol.
*Myo-inositol.
*Zinc capsules.
*Vitamin D3.
*Proderma antibiotics, one cicle.

Skincare:
*Lullage acne expert gel cleanser.
*Avene micellar water.
*Epiduo.
*Hidrocortisone cream for cystic pimples.
*Hydrocolloid bandages for whiteheads.
*Heliocare 50SPF colour cream sunscreen.

Edit: thank you redditors of /r/PCOS, /r/acne and /r/skincareaddiction for the great advises you give me everyday and the great posts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don,t know what to do to get rid of my acne marks and scars. I had a serious break out for the past few months and I start seeing some improvement after trying many things. For the past three days no new pimples but the state lf my face is not good and I,m really afraid of using exfoliation because they might make me break me out again. So I was thinking that TTO and rosehip oil had never broke me out in the past and I,ve read they could help but I don,t know if I can mix them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought some Paula's choice sample sizes and I thought I bought the vitamin c serum that everyone talks about, but it turns oout it was the "Resist Super Antioxidant Concentrate Serum with vitamin c". I wanted to buy it for my acne issues, as I read vitamin c can be helpful, but I don't think this product has enough vitamin c to help me with that, so I gave it to my mother and she's in love with the product because of the texture so she asked me to by a full size for her. She has oily skin and freckles, some wrinkles beggin to appear too. So, I want to be sure before buying a full size and my questions are: Have you tried this serum? Appart from the nice texture is any good? Do you reccomend it for her or for me (me: oily, acne prone, acne marks)? If not, what could I buy?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are studying a science degree I would strongly advise you against private, specially if you are not catholic or Christian, most of them, as someone said, are owned by Opus Dei and teach under their points of view, public universities are strong in sciences degrees. A private university is useful if you are going to study something like a business MBA that allows you to "pay" for a future job security, regardless that, to meet people and learn, not great. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Question] Can I use hydrocolloid bandages under the eyes? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-06 13:20:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Maybe it doesn't make sense... I have very recent under eye wrinkles, I think caused by my last eyes cream that I stopped using three days ago in case. I was reading how hydrocolloid bandages work (for acne) and it ocurred to me that it would be interesting to put them over the moisturizer at night to keep the humidity until the morning. I don't want to try before knowing if that's a completely wrong interpretation of how they works... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello. I've been breaking out for the past few months and by now I'm pretty sure is because of makeup removers. I've used: Banila Co. Clean It Zero, and then I switched to Avene Micellar water (that I was using before I broke out), Bioderma Sebium Micellar Water and lately Vichi Purete Thermale 3 in 1 makeup remover. All of them are breaking me out, I'm just using sunscreen and gel cleanser other than that, so it has to be that because I have used that sunscreen and gel for a long time. I don't know what to use to remove my makeup, everything I look have acne triggers. I live in Spain and they don't sell Neutrogena facial products here, and I need something I can buy in a shop. I was thinking about Baby oil, can it break me out? Do you have any suggestions? I don't want to spend a lot because I've already bought tons of products that I can't use. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-07-31 01:39:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a 31yo woman from Spain. 
I'm 159cm and 75kg. 
I have PCOS and high triglycerids and I'm on keto diet to reduce weight. 
I'm taking some supplements: Fish oil, Inositol, D-Chyro-Inositol, Vitamin D3 and psyllium fiber to help me with hormones and weight. I don't see that keto works for me as well as for people is doing it. I may eat too much but I don't think so, I ask this because I was seeing a nutricionist and he told me maybe I had high cortisol because I have some anxiety issues sometimes. 
*Could I get tested for that? What should I ask my doctor?
*Are there supplements or natural ways to reduce it in case I have it?
*Could it be slowering my weight lost?

	<TEXT> Don't worry, I understand is hard to believe for what I keep reading about keto and triglycerids. I don't know what's happening because when I started doing keto, in april, I first went to a nutricionist and he misinformed me, I discovered reddit and the keto subreddit and it blowed my mind. One month and a half later I quit the nutricionist and I started tracking my food, set my macros and doing it right. I don't understand why my triglycerids are so high (239). I'm going to get retested in august. My mother started keto a few months ago, and she's practicaly eating the same as me, and she showed me her blood panel, lower HDL, LDL and try. than in january, her MD was so surprised, since she'd told her the diet she's doing and she was advising against. But I don't know what happened to me. People have told me that sometimes the numbers get a bit crazy before they start settleling, I hope they are better next time, but I'm positive I'm doing keto right since may at least. </TEXT>
