	<TEXT> Hi all


We had some excellent discussion in the thread about what we enjoy most out of this awesome game.


The replies got me thinking, what would be your single most wanted feature in ESO?


For me it would be Zenimax investing in a better internet backbone for the EU PC realm (not sure if our brothers and sisters on XBOX and PS4 also have latency issues, if so then for them as well :) )


I am from South Africa, so I know I will have some latency, but in WoW and SWTOR may latency averages at 210 ms with 250 ms on a bad day.


With ESO however, I am very lucky to get below 300 ms and frequently go into 450+ ms.


So I would be thrilled if the latency can be reduced to values similar to SWTOR at least :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me it is the fact that the game makes me slow down, chill out and relax while playing it. I actually started exploring the world and reading the lore books and quest dialog as it is sometimes very funny, sad or just explains the world very well.


It is not just a race to the endgame as are other MMOs, ESO is a very enjoyable journey.

	<TEXT> I have the exact same hardware as you. Running GPU-Z and CPU-Z in the background shows little increase in GPU strain when in cities but CPU gets smashed. 

It is like Daagar said, MMOs are much more CPU bound than other games. Would be interesting to know exactly why, perhaps the client is predicting the location and movement vectors of all players ahead of time to make it seem like there is no lag. When server confirms the movement vectors the client adjusts accordingly and start to preemp the next frame. 

Anyhow there is an awesome add on called Valton's system settings (on phone now so exact name may require a Google ). This add on adjusts system settings in real time to maintain 60 FPS.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all

If a weapon have for instance a white base damage of 1250 and then an enchantment of Frozen Weapon that says it deals 1750 cold damage. Does this mean the total damage of the weapon is 3000?

Normal crafted weapons with only white damage have a damage of say 1350.

Does this mean that the mob dropped enchanted weapon is more than twice as powerful? If so, how does one learn the weapon enchants? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Started playing two days ago. Awesome, awesome game and great community. Here on Reddit and in game as well. 

What makes this game great for me is that it actually feels like an old school MMO again where you need to earn everything by playing the game. 

I only spend about 12 hours with my new ESO Nord DK but I actually start to feel for him. Haven't had this feeling of connection with my in game toon since the early days of WoW when the grind for everything was still real. 

Really hope the Crown store don't come and fuck this up with putting awesome gear and mounts behind a pay wall. 

That destroyed SWTOR for me and turned the game into space Barbie. 

I want to feel I put the effort in  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all

Playing a Nord Stamina Dragon Knight (may not be the most optimal race + class combo for min maxing, but I like the idea of it :) )

I am seeing from guides that all use bow and 2H at max level. Currently I am level 7 (still a baby yeah) and stuff dies very fast, in fact so fast that the bow finishes them off before I can get to chop them up properly with my melee 2H skills.


Given the above, following then:

1. Should I stick to using the bow until enemies start to require a bit more DPS to take down? 

2. Is there a quick button (PC) to switch between a bow and 2H on the run.

3. Should I alternate between bow and 2H every other level while leveling to keep them both equal on my way to end game?


Thanks to anybody taking the time to reply. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, I like the idea of leveling skills and professions by using them. It actually makes more sense if you think about it.

I definitely need to put in some hours into the game to get behind the combat and skills interaction. At least it seems that one can respec later if you messed up initially.

Is it also possible to repsec the points you put into stamina (currently as a dragon warrior I am putting all my points into only stamina as it says this is melee weapon boosting attribute). Do I need to split it between health and stamina, or will health auto increase as I level?

Thanks for the help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good day all


Starting playing last night. Game seems awesome :)


This is the first Elderscrolls game I am playing, but not my first MMO. I have a few questions though and would really appreciate some feedback regarding them.


1. It seems that none of the skills have a cool down timer. This is weird, because why would I then ever want to use any other ability as my most damaging single target ability on ST, and my most damaging AOE on AoE targets? Anything other than the single most damaging skill would be inferior? Really trying to get my head around this one.

2. Why don't the profession trainers have the options to train me in their specific profession? For instance in the starting island of the Nords there are a blacksmith, but speaking to her she only tells me about blacksmithing or give me the option to buy mats. Do I need to be a certain level to be able to learn professions?

3. How many professions can I have at a time? I would like to be a blacksmith to create my own armor and weapons. So for this I would probably need mining as a gathering skill right? Can one mix gathering and crafting professions?

4. Is it better to make all of your allowable initial professions gathering professions so that you can sell the mats you gathered while leveling on the auction house and then only start to max your crafting profession once you are max level?

5. I subbed based on the feedback you guys provided me with here. It seems like I have 2000 credits now. I am right in assuming that this game is not P2W right (seriously doubt it, because the community would not have been this great if it where :)) So are there any quality of life must haves from the shop that one need to buy on a new account? 

That is about it for now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am used to playing MMOs in third person. A lot of the screenshots I see for ESO is from a first person view.

Which one is better? 

My gut says third person, because you get to see what is behind you as well. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would a Nord 2H warrior be the closest to a WoW Arms warrior? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi all

Waiting for the game to complete the download (it is taking forever on my 2Mbs line ;p). So I am reading what I can over here and on some web sites.

I really enjoy playing a 2H warrior in MMOs. From what I can gather the closest to a WoW Human Alliance warrior would be a Nord 2H Warrior. 

Is my assumption correct?  </TEXT>

This way you at least have access to all the credits you obtained while having been subbed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is actually really sad. The game itself is awesome, I love the environments, choice of color schemes, the companions, the story, the whole Star Wars IP. 


It just seems that once you hit max level, you are done apart from the story. 


If one wanted to play single player RPGs, fire up for instance the Witcher. 


MMOs need to follow a very specific effort to reward formula to be successful over the long run. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is, I am questing still currently and have done a couple of dungeons and raids over the weekend, all on normal difficulty.

My crafted 228 fully augmented gear is good enough for this content, I don't die and do decent dps. It doesn't matter how many times I run a raid on normal though, I have a zero percent chance to upgrade my gear for at least a couple of months until I hit tier 2. 

Seriously though, what motivates you to do heriocs, dailies, dungeons and raids currently if you already did them and experienced the story if not for the possibility of upgrading your character in an MMO?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, level sync is nice while levelling but once you hit max level it definitely is a nuisance more often than not.

The mobs are not weak enough to one shot every time and not strong enough to be even remotely challenging. They are just there in the way of getting from x to y. Thankfully they don't dismount you frequently and it is sometimes faster to ride away from a green entrance until the in-combat debuff expires.

You don't gain anything by fighting them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wings of the architect does looks cool. I haven't seen it yet.

Well nice to know there are some unique cool stuff that can be found only by playing the game.

And personally I feel it is not elitist that people who put in the needed effort to do difficult group content over and over should have the right to wear the spoils of war. Personally I probably will not do it, but it is nice to know that the option is there should I want to try and commit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all


I have been thinking about this. Started playing the game about a month back. While I was levelling I took Archaeology, Underworld Markets and Synthweaving.


As soon as a new NPC joined me, I would send it out on the gathering missions. When I got to about level 45 I had maxed out Synthweaving and were crafting ilvl 228 gear to sell on the auction house.  

I hit max level yesterday evening and continued to play the story (finished Makeb last night). Due to my crew skill I was able to equip ilvl 228 augmented gear with purple 228 augments on every slot when I hit level 68.


Guess years of playing WoW conditioned me to optimise the game world and skills around me and min-max the shit out of everything :)

The problem however is that I now feel like I hit the ceiling gear wise in only a month. Part of the reason for this is that due to all my GTN sales from synthweaving I was able to buy a lot of the cool transmog sets I wanted like for instance the Exiled Master's set.

Also I see little benefit in mindlessly grinding away 200 CXP levels to start to get the possibility of slightly better ilvl gear.

What used to keep me going in WoW was farming old instances for gear to transmog, I must have done the old Karazhan about 50 times solo, once every week to get the Gorehowl axe to drop for my Arms warrior orc. There never was the option to buy it from the auction house. 

It feels like there is to much instant gratification in this game. When I see somebody on the fleet in a cool outfit / transmog / mount, instead of whispering them 'congratz on the awesome mount / axe' I look at the name of the set by inspecting them and then searching for it on the GTN. Seeing that it sells for instance for 2M credits, makes it accessible instantly to a huge amount of the population (credits are way to easy to get as well :)) 

So there is very little to feel proud about getting, after all why run an instance for 50 weeks just for an axe if not to wield it and get random compliments in dungeons / raids / openworld or to show respect to another player that have a very rare item that you know no money can buy, but can only be found by actually playing the game.

While on this gearing topic. Most MMOs typically have a very special (often much more awesome looking than anything before, partly due to it being new) set of gear that you can only get from completing the game on the most difficult content of the game while it is current. Everybody knows that if you see a player fully dressed in  Mythic Warforged gear in WoW for instance that that guy (or girl ;p) plays WoW like a second job and have very good skills. You have respect for the effort they put in to get it. Being able to buy the best looking gear on the auction house for a couple of hours worth of grinding materials takes away all respect one have for this gear.

If SWTOR is not like my initial one month view above, I apologise and would appreciate links to current only to be found in the most difficult content gear, then I will at least know what to farm, grind and practise for. </TEXT>
