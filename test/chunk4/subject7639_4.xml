	<TEXT> Its generally pointless to invest in subs, unless you destroy all enemy convoys sinking them will not do any damage and your enemy will still get his imports. Subs never manage to sink enough convoys. Just build convoys </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After many soviet games, I found out that to stop the German spearhead, you have to have your own armors striking at their rear. I don't advise tank destroyer divisions because these are usually soft themselves and hard attack will not help you much, since a tank division with motorized and SP-ART is like %50 hard, which makes wielding low soft and high hard bad. Instead, try to cut them off while they advance. Unless they are making a small encirclement, they will leave motorized behind, which is easy prey for your tanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tank destroyer divisions tend to be soft themselves, meanwhile main panzer divisions are %50 soft. So it doesn't matter if you have more hard attack or not, their panzer divisions will wreck your tank destroyer ones, since they have artillery. I tested this a lot, only way to stop the blitzkrieg is with your own tank armies with blitzkrieg researched. I don't rely on forts, and you need to have mobile warfare doctrine researched to match German panzers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well back then the games weren't designed for playing minors. I still find it pointless except Turkey, Romania and powerful minors. I see people who play belgium, australia and even switzerland in multiplayers who don't do anything until getting annexed by Germany. </TEXT>
