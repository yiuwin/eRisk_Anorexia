	<TEXT> He prefaces that statement with a tale about some wife beating scumbag who he could have killed, but let off with a "Mike warning", who came back and killed his wife. 

I feel like that is the half measure he was referencing. 

Maybe I'm crazy... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally. I prefer TV Shane to TV Rick any day of the week. I wish their situation had ended the other way around. No way Rick's skinny ass ever could have whooped Shane's ass were it not for poor scripting (let's not talk about Tyrone...). Rick was not the better character of the two. Tradition be damned. Shane's WD crew would have conquered the Southeast in two seasons. Shane would have become President Biff "Scarface" Walsh, and Carl would have loved his badass Pappy until the end of fucking time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The suits in Iron Man 3 were MODULAR. They weren't a one piece suit, they were many seperate sections that came together to make suits. Without a single solid frame to hold the sections together, these suits suffer from joint weakness in  every place that two or more sections come together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Solid Snake was trained by Miller to date Venom. Not simply take him out. This plan went to shit when Solid Snake found out that he couldn't take anyone over the age of 20 to Prom. It was then that Miller said "fuggit", and trained Snake to kill people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish for three things right now.

1. I wish I were a rentboy.
2. ... and that you would accept the services of a rentboy for payment.
3. ...and that the services of a rentboy could be delivered via mail.

Epic collection. Wish I had the cheese. Thats a terrific bargain. 

If thing don't work out, and you consider parting this lot out, I'd love to chat about that duo... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, if you pay attention to the multiple storylines in this game, you notice that something was building towards an epic climax between Eli, that ginger kid, and Sehalanthropus, but this kinda just went nowhere after those kids took what appears to be the series most advanced model of Metal Gear and ran off to God knows where. Next time we see Eli and Ginger they are grown up and scamming Solid Snake into activating a less formidable Metal Gear.  Sehalanthropus is never spoken of again. In all Metal Gear titles to date, the game has ended only after the destruction of said titular walking tank, and many times a satisfying one-on-one battle. 

Then there's that video of "Mission 51" which lays out exactly what was cut and underlines the fact that we didn't get a completed story. </TEXT>
