	<TEXT> Never said it didn't exist. My point was, purple can not be a single pure frequency of light as it doesn't appear on the visible spectrum - unlike violet which does.

What we perceive to be purple is a mixture of colours, usually a form of red and blue. In the case of the onion, the pigmentation is predominantly red, hence the name 'red onion'. </TEXT>
