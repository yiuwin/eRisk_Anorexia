	<TEXT> First of all, great choice on a booming industry. Radio is huge right now and as the population ages, i'm sure the market for radio shows is only going to grow.

i assume at this point in your life you realize that you are both hideous humans, however, what you may not know is that you are incredibly unentertaining and not funny. How do I know this? Simple everybody on the radio is incredibly unentertaining and not funny. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol, btw you know that the red bull commercial is actually joking about that very phenomena with that line. Thats not an actual statement of doing due diligence, they are literally making fun of the fact that american commercials have some absurd fast pace talking lines like that (mainly in prescription drug commercials) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> very interesting perspective. I'm curious though, do these immigrants coming to Mexico generally plan on staying because Mexico has a healthier economy then where they come from, or are they more likely to be just on the journey to the states? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will say this one time politely.

Tomorrow morning go to the nearest waffle house and get the all star special. If you fail to do this, I will call immigration services, explain to them that you have been living in America and not only haven't had waffle house, but haven't even heard of it. You will subsequently be deported.

My great-great-great grandfather didn't die at bunker hill for me to have to explain this to you. I will accept your apology in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This probably will get berried, but in these threads the whole talking to strangers thing usually gets brought up and as an american this is true, but there are some things i'm not sure you all realize about it.

First, this stranger conversation is very closely tied with the other theme of Americans being "superficial." These conversations on the outside appear as if two people are becoming new friends, but that very rarely is the case. We mostly keep the conversation as light hearted as possible.

Also this might be a generational thing for younger people (im 23) but I feel like there are a lot of invitations that people extend to new friends that are truly only half genuine. I think we just have an idea of sensing when they are genuine and when they aren't. I think with American youth people extend invitations to new acquaintances that are more so to be polite then an actual reflection of how you feel about them.

I haven't spent substantial time outside of the US so who knows, but I sense this point isn't always emphasized. </TEXT>
