	<TEXT> Na kiddo - I'll tell what I am...
I am the 5th son to 2 immigrants with 4th grade educations and from the 11th poorest country in the world, but ranked 1st in murder - Honduras. They left behind my 2 brothers for 5 years, they risked everything and I was born 1 year later in the South Bronx... 
I was there, have seen the beat leave the bedroom so many times... And it feels great - Go feel great my man and I hope you contribute more positively than this.... Peace. </TEXT>
