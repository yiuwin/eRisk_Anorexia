	<TEXT> I mean honestly they can say whatever they want to make themselves feel better and I'll just be over here with my hot boyfriend who's opinion about my body is the only one I care about besides my own. :')

I get what you mean though.  It annoyed me to see that stuff on Facebook when it was really prevalent a couple years ago, especially among people who often posted statuses about trying to lose weight...??  Nowadays on my Facebook feed at least it seems to be more about self deprecating memes which are slightly less infuriating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not trans but there's been times in my life where I've questioned it.  I think ultimately for me it comes down to not feeling comfortable in a womanly body.  Puberty was borderline traumatic.  I don't have much boobs, hips, or butt at any weight but obviously the lower I am the more they go away.  There's probably like an inch difference between my hips and waist so as you can imagine my fat distribution is quite unfortunate.  I end up looking boyish but that's cool with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of my family and close friends know because I have a history including hospitalization.  It was a long time ago though and I've been denying the relapse.  My mom and my ex bring up my weight sometimes and I just keep telling them I know what I'm doing and I wont go too low.  Mostly I want to tell them to fuck off and stop talking about my body. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im in a long distance relationship and he's coming to see me for a week!  We haven't seen eachother in 4 months and it's pretty much the worst thing ever and I can't believe I get to see him soon and I'm SO FUCKING HAPPY.  I'm probably gonna eat a shitton while he's here but I don't even care right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha yes, I feel so shitty about this after the fact but my boyfriend got upset/depressed about something for a couple days and didn't eat for at least two days without even thinking about it.  He's already small but he looked noticeably smaller and more delicate and I was jealous/turned on. -_- </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Warning: gross comment ahead

I lost one once and I didn't feel a thing. I had been drinking and forgot I had one in.  Get this - I even went to the doctor because I was having a weird discharge and he did a pelvic exam.  Didn't find anything.  They did a bunch of tests and didn't find anything except staff cells in my urine, which they put me on antibiotics for.  The discharge got worse.  It was absolutely terrible and I didn't know what the hell was going on.  Tampon came out on its own on DAY 20 (ewwww) during a bowel movement.  I was probably really lucky I had already been taking those antibiotics.

So if you don't go to the doctor now, if you notice any usual discharge within a week or so, get yourself to one fast.  Tampons can be very good at hiding. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a good question.  Sometimes I think I want to look attractive, but for example, when I wear something and can see the bones in my chest, I don't think it's attractive at all, and I'll try to cover it up.  BUT it makes it happy that I can see the bones.  It doesn't really make sense at all lol.

I do like baggy clothes and feeling tiny in them though.  Most of the time I feel like I dress kind of sloppy because of this.  Also most of the time I do not like to look feminine.  Once in a blue moon I will feel like looking pretty and girly but whenever I try I just feel awkward and stupid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was 108 this morning.  I know there have a been a few discussions about having no hips recently and I think I'm a pretty good example of that, lol.  Never curves. :(  
The stretch marks are from pregnancy. -_-

	<TEXT> I'm so sorry.  My mother minimizes everything too and it SUCKS.  It was related to something else but she used the "I never noticed that so it must have not happened," response.  I was not living with her!  Just fucking infuriating.  I hate when people just try to pretend nothing bad ever happens so they can go back to posting lies about their happy lives on facebook. -_-

Up to you obviously but maybe try having another conversation with them about how their reaction made you feel?  I know it gets tiring after awhile.  I've pretty much given up trying to make my mother understand anything about me, but I can't say I didn't try. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never fasted on purpose.  I've always done high cal restriction.  Even at my lowest weights, like sub 100 lbs, I would force myself to get at least get 800 or I would start passing out all over the place and bringing a lot more attention to myself than I wanted.  High cal restriction also makes it a lot easier to keep people from thinking I'm not eating.  I love the gym too so I feel like I need it for that.  Doesn't really bother me because I'm still losing and I feel in control most of the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Completely.  I love food.  I think it's hilarious when people say stuff like anorexics hate food.  Pretty much the opposite for me.  I constantly think about food, when I can eat next, what I should eat.  I don't fast because I absolutely do not care to.  I can still lose or maintain a low weight by eating something everyday; I look forward to it, lol.  I feel like through all my years dealing with this disorder I know a lot about food and calories and how they affect my body.  I like to think that I've made food my bitch instead of the other way around, but I think I'd be kidding myself most of the time. </TEXT>
