	<TEXT> Hasn't officially happened yet, but the first couple of drafts of next year's schedule has her teaching one class of 11th grade English.  She's a former English teacher and has made it her mission to revitalize the department, especially in the face of all the CCSS stuff we'll be working on next year.  So from her point of view, what better way to try and help move the department forward than to actually become part of if.  We will see how it goes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YES!  Just tried watching the last Rangers game and it kept freezing if I tried to skip ahead.  I think it was maybe doing that because I would skip into a commercial break and it wants to hold you there, but since you fast forwarded into it, it somehow locks up.  I also hate you can't skip those damn commercials. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's definitely in the wrong spot in the line-up.  He's killed too many scoring opportunities so far this season.  That and he's obviously trying way too hard, swinging at pitches far outside the strike zone.  He needs time to regroup and also to relieve a little pressure.  Put him either farther down the order, give him some time off, or MAYBE send him to the minors like we did with Odor last year and hope he comes back fired-up with his confidence back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had a heart-to-heart talk with this high school sophomore who was making one bad choice after another.  Really tried to help straighten this kid out because I thought he really wasn't as bad as others made him out to be.  This is after he threatened to fight me after school over some really small thing.  Anyway, after our talk, he thanks me, saying no one had really ever tried to just talk to him.  He was always just kicked out of class, sent to the office, suspended, etc.  

So I felt good after all this.  Thought I was making a difference.  Less than a week later he sets off hundreds of fireworks in the cafeteria during lunch.  Caught on surveillance tape and everything doing it.  End of his high school career.  That was many years ago and I'm still extremely disappointed in the whole thing. </TEXT>
