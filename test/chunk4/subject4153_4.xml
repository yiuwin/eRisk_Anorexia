	<TEXT> THAT'S really interesting. It's very neat to learn about these little quirks between sports. A baseball fielder running around inside and outside of the foul line seems perfectly normal...but it would be totally different watching a basketball player or football player treating those lines like the edge of a cliff. That would be completely expected. And that's where cricket seems to lie, as long as you can get the ball back into play without touching both it and the ground at the same time, it's fair.  </TEXT>

But, his movies sorta became shittier and shittier and so that all fell apart until the reboot. 

So it *was* in someone's mind. Just didn't work out as planned. It does make you wonder why they didn't hold off on Casino Royale just a little longer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is kind of odd. As a device to process information, square or rectangular is obviously the best. It's one reason we don't have round tablets or computer monitors. Besides replicating an analog watch..which isn't an insignificant reason, I understand, since the watches are pretty superfluous technology...there's zero advantage to a round face. So it's like people are getting passionate over their choice where the only edge of their smartwatch is the ability to make it really look like a "dumb" watch. It's a wee bit strange.

I don't hate the round watches, I've been designing watch faces and have thought about getting a round watch as well to open my possibilities more and have options. But I got the G watch at a great sale and just can't justify even one watch at full price, nevermind two. But when the R or the Urbane might go on sale in the future, I might just pick one up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll take a stab at some of it...

1. Yes. It was an intentionally vague presentation, but in some form of understanding the Island was there to keep "something bad" at bay. Probably not intended to be anything specific as we are familiar with..a literal Christian hell or Set from Egyptian mythology...but just an open "badness" that works well enough for storytelling. I'm not sure I understand the second part of this one though, what exactly is devaluing everything in your mind?

2. It was both. My conjecture would be that it started genuinely as a game between demi-gods and after several hundred years of just playing the game, Jacob turned his focus also towards finding a successor. Either because he was worried he would lose and be killed sooner than later or simply boredom from being the Protector for a couple thousand years. But, again my interpretation, I'd say it was ostensibly a game to the Man in Black until only fairly recently in their lifetimes, to when he might've clued into Jacob's true intentions and been more proactive in eliminating potential threats or being more heavy handed in manipulating groups.

3. With pregnancy a major issue, the long-term viability of the Others was a big concern. How else to keep the group alive if they can't "breed: it from within? And taking possible members very early on would be the best way to go, to start brainwashing or indoctrinating as soon as possible before things got messy and violent to where it would be very challenging as they would be trusted even less.

4. I think this is largely an account of grand "fate". And not one entity's intended plan. Rather than saying cancer doesn't exist, I think it's more accurate that the Island can heal. The Island can heal miraculously, maybe even just by default, and punish severely at it's whim. Ben was punished because he'd not..."pleased" the Island in his place of authority and he deserved to be dethroned. Richard told Locke that he'd become too focused on the pregnancy issues and had forgotten "they have a greater purpose". Ben wasn't a Protector, but Richard and Ben and the Others were an "extension" of Jacob's role and Ben had become too modern and cozy and too sidetracked on his own agendas and not concerned with the greater goal that the Island serves. And I mentioned "fate" because, my understanding is this judgment came down from the Island. Jacob was very hands off at this late point in his tenure, mostly focused on finding a successor. And the Man in Black had never been shown to have powers of this sort. So it was just that LOST coincidence/fate that the Island tried to eliminate Ben at the same time that Jacob independently had brought a new group of Candidates to the Island, and one happened to be a spinal surgeon. 

5. The blast door map is kind of a funny thing. In the end, I don't think it's something to be too concerned with sorting out. At it's introduction, it was a crazy-cool intriguing element to fill us with awe and questions. And later we learn it was made by Randzinsky, who at the point of creating it had gone a wee bit insane. So he and it are unreliable narrators. We know for a fact that he was very knowledgeable in Dharma's goings on from the beginning and shouldn't need a map and knows the virus thing is hooey. So was it born from insanity? Or him forming his own agenda? Seeing some purpose in perpetuating the virus myth and keeping his partners in check for some reason? It's hard to say how much of it, if in fact any, should be confidently embraced as canon and how much are just the ramblings of a mad man. It's great for the writers as they could appear to have dumped a lot of juicy, exciting info on us, but then they injected it with as much doubt and misinformation as they potentially needed...and later on anything that didn't vibe with the map wouldn't necessarily have to be retconned or explained...it was just crazy ol' Randzinsky.

6. At introduction...like the map..it was a crazy-cool thing to get forums and water coolers all a twitter the next day. Eventually at some point, Damon and Carlton said it was Dharma honoring the Egyptian pioneers on the Island. 

7. Like RegularGuy said, Locke was stuck after Jacob was killed and until then could do everything as before as far as morphing and impersonating other people. It was just in his best interest at this point to present himself fully as Locke for the most part, rather than manipulating through fear or wonder by appearing as the dead. 

8. I really don't remember...so I think it could probably be seen as just Jacob being Jacob. Something intriguing and mysterious early on, before we saw Jacob and his brother as boys and recognized who the apparition was.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't mind the flash sideways as a concept, I think the idea works well enough with the general philosophy of the show. But I agree it took up way too much time, because they felt so chained to their "flash-something" format. I get it, it makes sense to keep that consistency and be able to further twist the concept of flashbacks and have a thread of mystery on what exactly they were. But they don't hold up significantly in retrospect and so Damon and Carlton maybe should've reconsidered adhering so strongly to their format. Worse of all for me was the phony baloney sense of urgency in the flash-sideways story where they tried to make it run parallel to the island story and present it as if they didn't all meet up at the perfect time their "moving on" might be in jeopardy..which of course wasn't the case in the slightest. 

It's kinda like with the Jin flashback/Sun flashforward episode where the audience is flat out tricked...they acknowledged that they could really only pull that once and not have the audience be untrusting and not as invested in the narrative. But it was just one episode, and the flash-sideways kinda end up feeling like a season-long trick </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This seems pretty dumb. How exactly would it be structured? The first..I dunno, doesn't really matter..half? of the book is the miniseries and then you have to go to the theater to see the second half? It's supposedly being done this way to give more hours towards the story, so we shouldn't expect the miniseries to be fluff and unnecessary, right? And if you want to see the movie you'd have to also pay for Showtime as well or you'd be missing half the story. It makes no sense.

They're very limited with details on how it's supposed to work, but the only thing that would make sense to me is if the miniseries...and not an 8-part one, yeesh...was like a prequel of some sort or a companion and told a parallel story while parts of the book were happening in other parts of the country. Fun, but not vital to enjoying the theatrical movie. But like I said, this whole experiment is about giving a giant book as much time as possible, so wasting any time on new material would go against that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've used the Andy emulator some thinking it'd be a bit quicker to get through making a watch, and it just didn't feel like much of an improvement. I want to be able to quickly scroll through elements and scroll down to alter code, but I can't..I have to drag "my finger" on the screen to navigate and it's actually slower and not as fluid as doing it on the phone. I want to be able to write out a bunch of repetitive bits of code in Notepad and copy and paste them quickly into many, many watch elements...but I can't copy and paste from Windows to the emulator. The interface is designed for phone use, so the buttons and interactive bits are large and wasted space on a computer where you have a precision cursor.

It can be tedious as hell but, for me, editing on the phone ended up being the way to go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not too tough once you've seen the method. To help, I made a little simple watch with a big ol' button that simply switches the time from 12 hr mode to 24 hr mode. My understanding of Watchmaker and Lua programming in general is very limited, so take it with a grain of salt. But from what I've cobble together from looking at other watches and taking them apart, "switching modes" is really a matter of toggling visibility for elements. You hit a button and it makes one element disappear and another appear. This can be really basic like my example, where I have two time-telling elements and the button makes the 12 hr time disappear and the 24 hr appear. Or it can be very elaborate with backgrounds and other graphics could change as well making it appear like a totally different watch. Just a matter of what effect you want to accomplish.

This might be too explanatory or seem condescending or really elementary based on how much you've messed with the app..but I figure with teaching something it's usually best to err on the side of explaining into too much detail, rather than too little. And personally, I'd like to really know what the code is doing rather than just being told "Paste this here and paste that there". Ya know, one of those "Teach a man to fish..." kinda things. 

So download [this watch](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B87bLR2Jh090V1M2ZmNadUFtdFE) and it'll be much easier to follow along. It'll be helpful I think to have code to look at where you know exactly what each piece is doing and there's not other stuff thrown in to confuse the matter. Here, the only code is about switching modes. 

First thing, after you've imported it, go to customize the watch and before selecting any element, scroll down to the "Script" field and click the bit of code to go to the editor. Okay, at top: var_watch_mode = 1 is the name of the variable I'm setting up and it's current setting of 1. var_watch_mode can be anything, it's just easy to understand and self explanatory- it's a variable that's about changing the watch mode. And as soon as the watch is loaded, it is set to be 1.

Down below is the function that will change that variable number which in turn will change the appearance of the watch. switch is the name of the function, and again it could be anything, this is just a simple, intuitive name. The function basically says that when ever the function runs(when it's activated by my button, in this example) if the variable is less than 2, than we're going to add 1 to it. If it's more than 2, then it gets reset back to 1. The 2 in this code, is like saying how many modes you want to have. I have a watch I'm working on with 4 different modes you toggle through. So I change this number to 4. In the end, this is just a really simple function that does nothing but increases a number every time a button is pressed, but to make it useful, we'll tie in watch elements to those changing numbers.

Okay, hit the done button and go back out to where you can see the individual watch elements. Tap on the purple circle, that's our button, and scroll down to "Tap Action". Go to edit it, and you'll see switch () in the box. This is just referencing that function from earlier, just saying "when this circle is tapped, do that function". Hit done, and go back to select the second time, it should be the second icon in the row. 

Scroll down to the Opacity setting and go to edit it. Be EXTRA careful to hit the far right where the down arrow is, so you go into editing mode. If you just hit the middle of the line of code, you'll wipe out the code and reset it back to a number. I've done that so many times trying to work on my watches...ugh. Okay, once you're in the editor, you'll see an argument. What it's saying is if var_watch_mode is equal to 2 than the opacity is set to be 100(completely visible) and if the mode isn't 2 than it is 0(and invisible). And below the white box, in the light gray rectangle to the left of the black Done button...you'll see the answer to this argument, currently it should be 0 since the button hasn't been pressed yet. Hit done and go select the first icon, the first time-teller. 

Go to edit its opacity and it should start making sense now. Here is another argument that says the same thing as above, but instead of watch mode equaling 2, it wants to know if var_watch_mode equals 1. And in the gray box below, the answer should be 100. 

You can see I also added "12 HR" and "24 HR" indicators, using the same lines of code, just to make the change a little more evident. 

The last thing I did, just to show a tiny bit more of what you can do with the variable and function. When you press the button, the color of the button also changes. Go back to altering the button and scroll down to the color setting and try editing it. Same format as the opacity settings but using the color codes instead of 100 and 0 to indicate opacity. The argument says if var_watch_mode equals 1 than the color is purple and if the variable isn't 1 than it is red. Notice in this case, that you must put the color codes inside single quotes to make sure the argument works. Oh, and by the way, buttons can be invisible too, I'm sure many of the watches you've seen have been set up to where you tap the time itself to change between 12/24 hour mode or tapping the date to see the current temperature...or whatever. In those cases, you'd just make the button be the same size and shape as the element you wanted to tap and set it's opacity to 0. 

Let me know if this all makes sense and seems to work out for you. Like I said, this is really basic, but it's the building blocks for doing really complicated and interesting things. You just have to be creative and keep all your variables straight in your brain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was probably the best thing McFarlane made, I never liked their approach to the figures where each one was so uniquely iconic to just the character to where you could hardly have a group display. Certain characters, sure..I can see someone just buying a Jack or a Locke for their shelf...but who would've just bought a Shannon? It's an ensemble show, so I think an ensemble figure display makes more sense. Personally, at least. 

So since the figures were a bit of a dud and they nailed the playset, it's too bad they didn't try more of these types of pieces, I think there were a lot of potential 'dioramas' from the show. When the first series hit and you could assume it'd have a good future, I thought a playset of the hatch computer and clock was a guarantee.  </TEXT>

Well, at the risk of getting your hopes up falsely again...I tested this a bit more and it appears to be working. It seems like it might be a bug with the {ddw} and {ddww} tags, but I tried it with the numbered days of the week tag and it looks to be working. Give it a shot. I'm not using the beta though, so this might be no help as well. 

({ddw0}== 6 and 'ff0000') or ({ddw0}==0 and '0080ff') or '000000'

	<TEXT> I messed around with it and might have a solution. I thought it was maybe something with the parentheses, an argument not being closed off right and confusing the program...but I copied yours exactly and it worked fine with my argument based on hours instead of days (so I could easily test it right now). 

Then when I tried it with days, I was getting the same thing as you describe, it just stuck with black. But I tried removing the single quotes around the days of the week and it started working! That surprised me, typically it's the opposite and things don't seem to want to work right until you quote them..but give that a shot and see if it works for you too.  </TEXT>

But I haven't found any "trick" that produces a different result. Especially annoying when the green text uses a custom font as well but it worked fine perfectly from the start.

I even downloaded a couple copies of the font from different sources in case one had the error, but it didn't change anything. I might have to try a totally different look-a-like font.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm working on my first watch face and have loved the editor but hit a snag that I can't find a workaround for. I added Arial MT Black to use for my time digits, and everything looks fine in the editor, but when I send it to the watch, those numbers are skewed and partly cut off for some reason. 

I don't know if the custom font is truly the issue, but it seems like something might be screwy with it if all the other text I've added, including something else with a custom font, appears perfectly fine. I've included a [photo of my watch face](http://i.imgur.com/M2rFEoq.jpg), you can clearly see the first two zeroes are the issue I'm having. I did nothing in the editor to apply any obliqueness or anything like that, only changed the font size and positioning. Has anyone run into this problem before? </TEXT>

I'm sure having any reference in game will be some benefit but trying to gauge your accuracy when the overlay is hovering 100' above the map and therefore no longer to the same scale, that's not ideal. Projected on the map would be so much nicer compared to constantly raising and lowering it to see how the streets are matching up.

But it's one of my top requested mods since I have a number of cities I'd like to recreate, so I'm thrilled to have any help and I'm going to spend some more time with it and see how it feels. Thanks very much! </TEXT>
