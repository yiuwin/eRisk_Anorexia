	<TEXT> In 1939, the Germans had better tanks and aircraft than the Soviets. On top of that, a communist invasion of Europe would be something that the entirety of Europe could rally behind, possibly including the US. If the Soviet Union attempted to steamroller into Prussia and Pomerania, it would buy time for the allies to proper equip themselves for a war, including the full deployment of Dewoitine D.520s, better French tanks on the ground and the chance to properly equip the French Army. The British would be able to reinforce their troops in France and begin to bolster a potential French offensive into Germany.

In our timeline, the French were such pushovers because they had no confidence and their leaders had both feet planted firmly in 1914. A few victories on German soil would likely be the kick in the pants the French Generals need to sort their way of fighting out, as they had prepared for a repeat of the trenches.

The Russians, the French had not fought properly in recent memory. Against the Germans, the soldiers knew that they had come within a hair's breadth of losing Paris in the last war, so would have been understandably terrified and weary of fighting the same enemy twice in two decades. If I recall correctly, the last time the French had directly fought the Russians was the Crimean War, and they gave them a pasting. This time around, they would be more prepared and able to put up a more than decent fight. Couple that with the mammoth industrial machinery that is America and you have a decent war machine.

I could envisage a Franco British push into Germany when the Germans shift divisions East to fight the Russians. They would meet in the middle of Germany and attempt to broker a truce, during which both sides dig in extensively. When the truce breaks down, a brutal war of attrition begins.

Would put more but sleep beckons me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw something over at /r/daystrominstitute that makes sense about that episode.

It didn't actually happen. It was one of Tom Paris's early holonovels, as he was trying to capture the essence of 1930s novels of a similar vein, considering stuff like the sound barrier and the things people thought might happen once you crossed it.

The post itself is much more detailed, but I cannot for the life of me remember what the actual thread was about to begin with. Suffice to say, it is now part of my personal head canon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In our timeline, the Suez Crisis was a drastic miscalculation. This was down to it being seen as imperialism by the rest of the world. In addition, no one liked what the USSR was doing in Hungary, so Eisenhower had to be seen to tar both foreign interventions with the same brush to avoid aggravating the USSR further.

Therefore, the US must either pay no attention to Hungary, which would be in direct conflict with Truman doctrine, or condone the British and French intervention in Suez. Assuming the latter, the US ends up being seen as two-faced, seriously damaging their credibility.

On the other hand, British and French control of the Suez region and implementation of a sovereign base area or similar around the canal allows empire bias and mercantilism to continue much longer. This means that the largest trading partner for much of the commonwealth remains the UK. As a result, the UK economy remains manufacturing based for much longer, allowing for more stability in the economy. It may also slow drastically the decolonisation process. If the British are seen to have succeeded in what is effectively a colonial conflict, then they may be more likely to hold onto their African and Asian colonies and fighting off any independence insurgencies in the regions. In the long run, this would be better for the colonies themselves, as they are parted with much more smoothly with the British supervising free elections and ensuring stability before backing out entirely, to retain credibility and an on going trading partner.

I can't really comment on the other aspects, as I do not know much about French foreign policy during the 1950s. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're talking about **market socialism**, not complete Marxist worker control of all industry and commerce.

Edit: however, market socialism is a very broad thing. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism, the type described here is akin to what you describe, but the type of market socialism I am arguing for is a coordinated market such as the one implemented by west Germany after ww2. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy </TEXT>
