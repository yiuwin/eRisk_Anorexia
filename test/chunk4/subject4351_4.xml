ELMONT, NEW YORK, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 09, 2012, @ 20:10 HRS. (LOCAL) - A husband and wife, both highly educated professionals, witness, they estimated, approximately 12 orange lights in front of their car, as they drove on Long Island, New York, approximately 17 miles east of Manhattan . 

PEORIA, ILLINOIS, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2012, @ 20:15 HRS. (LOCAL) -Two women, driving from Peoria to Chillicothe, Illinois, witness a cluster of orange lights in the nighttime sky. Full The National UFO Reporting Center has received multiple reports about an alleged event that has occurred there tonight, September 21st, in England, Scotland, and Ireland. Multiple parties have reported to our Center, both via telephone, and via our Online Report Form, that they had been recent witness to clusters of orange "orbs" or "fireballs." In at least one case near Wolverhampton, one of the fireballs allegedly passed rapidly across the sky, slowed to a stop, and then took on the appearance of a cylindrical object, which exhibited lights at both of its ends. It then proceeded to pass slowly down the length of a local thoroughfare. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only remember one part of the movie and it is very vague so I am not sure if youll be able to figure it out. A woman is sitting in her rocking chair in almost complete darkness at the top floor of a clock tower and her son comes up the stairs and says something to her then something terrifying happens. It was quite an older movie, I just remember that scene scared the shit out of me.
Any help would be nice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dave Schrader received this strange photo, taken at Lost Lake, Colorado, from his friend Jami Windecker. Originally, she dismissed the odd 'entity' in the photo as merely smoke from the campfire or a cigarette, but was astounded once she saw the lightened version of the picture. Windecker agreed to share the photo with the C2C audience and appeared at the start of Saturday's program to discuss the baffling picture.

	<TEXT> It is an alien being or an interdimensianal being of some sort.

The being appeared to be wrapped in aluminum foil as it began to walk toward Greenhaw.

"It looked like his head and neck were kind of made together... he was real bright, something like rubbing mercury on nickel, but just as smooth as glass; different angles give different lighting. I don't believe it was aluminum foil."

The tinfoil alien's movements were very "mechanical" like. An antenna was attached to his head. Though in shock, he managed to snap off four pictures of the odd looking alien. When he flicked on his headlights the alien was obviously frightened, as it began to make its escape. </TEXT>
