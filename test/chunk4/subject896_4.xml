	<TEXT> If I see one more person texting while driving I will pull them out of their car and beat them. I'm so sick of watching people swerve all over the road b/c they're too busy texting "lol". 

However, as badly as I'd like texting banned while driving, I don't think banning the use of all devices is the answer. This mentions nothing about hands-free mode either. Why is the choice always all or nothing? </TEXT>

Your build is so simple, I feel like I can replicate it with relative ease. Which is good b/c I'm far from handy. Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't care about the characters anymore. I don't worry for them when shit goes down, I don't hope so-in-so finds love, and I really don't care for the complete character change Dexter has made this season. 

He used to be so calculating and careful. Now Vogel seems to control him like a puppet. He's a terrible Dad, as Harrison's main line in this season is reminding people of his name. I feel no chemistry between Dex and Hannah (Sorry, Yvonne- you're cute and all), and the only character that I occasionally sympathize with is Deb. 

Fuck the whole Joey and Jamie thing, too. It's a cheap story arc and no one gives a shit. We could have had naked Jaime shots some other way. I didn't need to see Joey getting banged yet again. 

Everyone in the series could die and my reaction would be, "Meh." The Trinity season was by far the best, and since then it has been downhill. Breaking Bad manages to keep up with good episode after good episode. It seems like the Dexter writers had a lot of other good things to work with, but chose not to. Instead, sex scene with Jaime. Sex scene with Hannah. ANNNNDDDD fill in the rest with whatever. Oh yeah, where's that cute kid? What's his name?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Problem is, I'm sure the police officer has the proof you want, not /u/Bohica_Dirtstar. And yes, Microsoft HAS ignored it. The officer has been waiting for a reply from them. I suppose if one has the money to hire a litigator, then Bohica would be set. Or he could forego all the tomfoolery in court and just buy another 360. Besides, their legal department will only speak to the officer in charge of the theft, not Bohica. 

And it's not like saying "I lost my Xbox. Microsoft should find it." It was stolen. There's a bit of a difference. And how would Bohica get a copy of the warrant anyway? So, when it comes to something wreaking of bullshit, I suggest you take a big whiff of yourself.

EDIT: Thanks, /u/LinkerGuy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I, personally, think it has to do with the lakes to the north and south of us. Also, Denton sits lower than it's surrounding areas. Maybe those factors keep a protective bubble over us? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A friend of mine was working in a grocery store late at night. A couple of girls come in and ask him where they can find cupcake mix. He tells them the aisle where the cake mix is stocked. They come back to him 2 minutes later and inform him that he was mistaken. All they had on the shelf was cake mix.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jericho has more audience over Firefly? Really? I find that difficult to believe. I completely disagree with the only-fans-of-Firefly-were-originally-fans crap. The majority of people I know that love the show, had never seen it before. Their fan base grows every year. The cast has mentioned it in interviews that their panel crowds get larger and larger.  </TEXT>
