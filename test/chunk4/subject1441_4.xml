	<TEXT> I really think you should tell your mom. She probably already can tell if she's an attentive parent. She just may not have felt comfortable saying something because she didn't know how you would react. My therapist told me that the best gift a kid can give their parent is to let them help them. I get where you're coming from though. I too live with my parents and it was really hard to ask for help. Good luck, friend! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two events for me really but they both happened the same day. I got up before classes at 5 am to go for my run. It was pouring rain and just above freezing. I had worn out shoes and was so sore and started crying partway through because I wanted to stop but was too scared to. Later that day, I went to Walgreens to buy a snack and stood in the snack aisle for literally 20mins analyzing all of the nutrition content of all the foods and googling about the fruit and suck. I was starving but could not make myself buy anything. So I walked out in tears.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Repost of my experience from another thread (except for last paragraph):
It's honestly not as bad as I had thought it would be. I was diagnosed back in April and started OP. That worked really well for a few months, but then for some issues with OCD, I freaked out and lost a lot of weight really quickly. Coupled with heart rate and liver concerns, I was admitted yesterday to stay for a week or so to get stabilized. 

In some ways it's a relief because your meals are picked and plated and you are told to eat then. It helps with regular eating. There is a lot of monitoring and rules which is weird at first being an adult (especially going to the bathroom with the door open) but the forced accountability can help break habits and develop new strategies. The staff is great and able to help 24/7. Where I am, we get schedules every mornin with groups and private appointments to attend. Downtime is expected to be spent in a sitting room with other patients and a nurse so they make sure you aren't exercising in your room. 

Speaking of the other patients, there is a whole gamut of people here. There is a wing for teens here and they are kept mostly separate. The adult wing is mostly people in their 20's but several in their 40's and some who have retired and such. A whole range of disordered behaviors too. It's honestly pretty interesting to see how the same/ similar disorders can manifest the same but different in different people. If that makes sense. It's also kind of nice to be surrounded by a community of people who actually understand this crazy disorder. 

I've since been discharged and inpatient was really helpful honestly. It's hard to be restricted but it interrupted symptoms and restarted my restoration process and in in the best place I have been in a very long time. I also made some damn good friends through the experience.  Kind, compassionate, and understanding despite their own hardships and struggled. I still have a ways to go but I feel so hopeful again. Feel free to PM me if you have more questions or need to talk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It definitely depends on what you want to major in/ what you want to do with the major. Med schools often prefer the two course sequence. As do many grad schools. At the end of the day, though, it doesn't matter too much. I will say that I have heard that the two course sequence is much more in depth and much more work than 501 (which is what I took). So if you are on the fence about it, I might recommend 501. But again, this really depends on your major as well as your academic strengths.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear that you're having such a tough time!  Have you tried telling your parents/ a teacher/ councilor what has been going on?  It's really hard and really scary but asking for help is the best possible thing you can do for yourself right now. Anorexia has one of the highest death rates of any mental illness and not just because of the starvation aspect- it makes many contemplate suicide. That being said, you are defiantly not alone in that regards. I'm struggling with anorexia right now too and even with parental and therapy, trying to gain back weight to be healthy is really difficult. I would be lying if I said that I haven't wished myself dead more than a few times during this process. 

What helps me with those feelings though is having the support of my parents. They don't truly understand the eating disorder because you can't truly understand it until you experience it, but they have read up on the subject such that they can encourage me in my recovery process and provide distractions from my feelings when I'm really low. 

My therapist has also been a huge factor in me working on recovery. My parents don't me in touch with her, and I honestly believe that I would be dead right now if I weren't seeing her on a regular basis.  It really helps me put the voices in perspective and to try to control them. I'm not trying to scare you, but I really really think it's important that you reach out to a close adult in your life that you can trust. You deserve to be happy and healthy and to live a full life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there, I have some weird things with utensils too. I have these small plastic spoons that my parents brought home from a froyo place once that I only use for dairy products. And the dairy products taste so much better when eaten that way. Without them, I'm more likely to choose nothing at all than eating something. I prefer plastic utensils in general but they're only a strict requirement for soup and dairy products. I also like to eat all my meals from bowls if at all possible. 

The partitioned plate thing you mentioned is really interesting. I have an issue with my foods touching and might have to experiment with that to see if it could help me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The gyms are all at their busiest in the mornings (around 8-9) and in the evenings 5-10) or so. The best is if you have a break during the day where you can go (late morning or early afternoon). If you can get there right when it opens, you're good too. On the weekends, it's busy except for the morning. 

All this being said, the least busy place is the shell followed by the nat. The serf will always be the busiest. Finally, this time of year is one of the busiest. Many people come to school with aspirations of visiting the gym regularly, but as the semester goes on, many stop going as classes get busier. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man, I feel like I could have just as easily written this post myself. You are certainly not alone in this feeling. I feel like my eating is constantly being watched and I'm being judged for eating huge amounts. I had to move back in with my parents because I just couldn't handle it on my own.  Comments like those made by your friends trigger me too even though I know they are not malicious. My friends and even some of my family members have unwittingly said this. Or commented on my food intake. As hard as it is, it might not be a bad idea to take a semester off and move home until you are more healthy.  You don't want to be chronically underweight and recovery is really really hard. I'm being supported by my parents 100% and I'm still struggling like that. Feel free to PM me if you ever need to talk with or vent to someone who gets it. Good luck! </TEXT>
