	<TEXT> It's really not at all. It only has 100 units so everyone knows everyone. The landlord is quick to put someone out if they cause any kind of problems. It's hard to get in and not be noticed. And the back gate walks you straight out to Northline mall/ Walmart. Now that Walmart and the area around it is ghetto as shit but as far as the apartments go they are nice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been gainfully employed for 2 1/2 years for the same company.  The money isn't bad but I feel like I could earn more. I've also been sober for 37 months and active in other people's recovery. I have a college experience but it's in Criminal Justice and I recently just successfully completed felony deferred adjudication. I've never been convicted of a felony just charged. I'm asking for y'alls input into what classes I can take at HCC to earn a certificate in some kind of trade or tech. I also work 45-60 hours a week so I would have to take classes at night. Please don't judge me for the felony. It was a messed up time in my life. And it wasn't a sexual or assault charge. I've overcome those demons and now a great member of society. Thanks in advance. 

Edit: I'm being down voted for whatever reason. I'm just asking for thoughts on college programs. Sorry if I have offended anyone.

	<TEXT> I love gooold. Anyways, the Juul uses nicotine salts from which I read it allows more nicotine absorption. The pods are really easy to refill. A simple YouTube search should explain it. But the cool thing is I found a liquid company that makes their juice with nicotine salts. [MrSaltE](https://gaslightvapor.com/collections/e-liquids/mr-salt-e-liquids)  </TEXT>

It's crazy how the company I work for can clean up that area once a week now and in a matter of hours it's back to where it was. I was talking to one of the police ladies and she said one time she gave them all trash bags and gloves to pick up all that trash and they did. So she was bringing them some treats (did not specify what they were) the next day and it was total trash again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Cync

Pros:
Premium juice pods that last about a day to a day and a half.
Pods are a decent price. 
Pods come in a variety of nic levels and flavors. 
Physical size of battery and pod isn't to big. 
Flavor on these things is amazing. 

Cons:
Pods leak and spit back every now and then. 
Battery doesn't last very long after full charge. 
Pods take 3-4 days to be delivered. 

If I had to choose between the Cync or the Juul I would pick the Cync. Battery may not last long but they have an option to get a bigger battery. The pods are very flavorful and there are a lot of options. If you are a cloud chaser then this thing is not for you.  </TEXT>
