	<TEXT> Basically some people on Facebook were saying that it's better to leave the car because it would "turn into a freezer". That sounds dumb to me but I never once experienced winter so I'm not the best person to judge. From my understanding, staying in the car should be better since it would block wind, which also means that inside of the car would effectively be warmer than outside. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fine Arts or painting probably aren't viable but digital art is definitely a sought for skill in the creative industry. 

As for music, unless you are qualified enough to be a teacher (instrument tutor,  music lecturer, etc.), I'd say you can't expect to survive solely on the Music Industry here.  However, I do think that the music scene in Singapore is slowly but surely getting better so I'm happy and supportive of our local musicians.

I don't know much about dance but it's not dead at the very least.

	<TEXT>  Over half the comments say that the low prio was justified anyway, because I picked techies.

I'm not one of the comments.

 Posting here has giving me nothing but flame and insults.

I have neither flamed you nor insulted you so far.

 It doesn't help me get out of low prio, it won't change the system and it sure as fuck won't change reddit's anti-techies bias.

I don't have an anti-techies bias. Or at least I don't intend to bring it into the conversation.

 Believe whatever you want to believe, report whom you want to report and live how you want to live.

Of course, but that's terribly off-topic and I want us to stay focused on the topic at hand.

All I'm asking is a couple of screencaps *you had declared that you are willing and agreeable to post*. All I'm asking is for your words to not be empty ones. You don't have to write me lines about how you feel personally attacked by other people for I am not part of it; I am not even "on the fence", I am just "away". You could have simply spent the effort on doing what you said you'd be "happy to" instead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care what anyone says, I see no balance in Monkey King at all.

* God-given 300 melee attack range. The basis is to fit the lore but it's too ridiculous an advantage to give to a hero just to be more lore-friendly. Literally the only deviant in the attack range mechanics. Even fucking TA doesn't have that attack range as a ranged hero.

* Boundless Strike is everything ES (fissure) dreams to be, especially the fact that it is fail-safe since it does not block the path.

* Tree Dance is basically a whole new mechanic by itself only Monkey King utilizes. It puts invisibility-based gankers, escapers to shame.

* Without specially picking heroes to counter Tree Dance, it is literally impossible to counter. There are just so many ward spots that provide flying vision, so basically forested areas outside the range of these wards spots are go-fuck-yourselves zones against Monkey King. Just to put it in comparison, invisibility is always possible to counter with detection items that everyone can purchase at anytime.

* If you are able to cut down the tree he stands on, it punishes him very greatly, that is true. However, what are the chances, really? His tree jump has such a long range and short cooldown. With flying vision, there's no way he can't see you coming, and if he does he simply effortlessly jumps far away into safety. Only an idiot Monkey King player would not escape a QB attempt or timbersaw (timber chain and chakra both have relatively long cast times and projectile traveling time). And this is all assuming you know which tree he is standing on in the first place. 

* Oh, don't forget, Tree Dance comes with a sub-ability which might as well be a standalone ability considering it is a heavy AoE nuke.

* Jingu Mastery is basically putting Ursa Fury Swipes together LC Moment of Courage and then upgrade the combination. And *then* further indirectly upgraded with the fact that Monkey King has 300 attack range.

* Transformation is yet another unique mechanic by itself, yet again exclusive to Monkey King. The only thing that comes close to this is Techies' warning sign, and I'm sure I don't need to explain why one of them is significantly better.

* Ultimate isn't very strong, to be fair. But also to be fair, it's pretty much foolproof and this hero already fucking has 5 other abilities.

* You must be thinking, "this hero's a strong carry, but since he's a carry it also means he needs items so we can work on hindering that". Well, let me tell you that Monkey King is a fucking carry and support simultaneously. As mentioned, Boundless Strike is a superior Fissure. Tree Dance basically makes him a mobile observer ward. Ultimate helps to make the teamfight messier in a good way for his team. He doesn't need to farm, he can fucking gank like a support early but snowball like a flash farming hard carry. Fuck this.

Ok enough complaining, here are some suggestions on how to balance Monkey King, albeit not necessarily well thought out.

* Nerf/remove Boundless Strike stun.

* Rework Tree Dance to make it less easy to use. Also make make it actually possible to counter without specific heroes.

* Heavily nerf/rework Jingu Mastery.

* Remove/ rework his especially long attack range. Maybe integrate it into Jingu Mastery?

* Remove Transformation. I know it's to fit the lore but is totally unnecessary for him to function well as a hero. </TEXT>

 EU player: "Fucking Russians ruining our games, go back to RU server."

 NA player: "Ow I guess that's just too bad for you. But Russians are funny anyway, I most certainly know that because I watch funny Russian pub videos on YouTube all the time!"

 SEA player: "Omg nobody bothers to communicate on this server, everyone just want to carry. Sometimes people just flame each other from the start and intentionally feed out of rage, how the fuck do I even climb MMR like that?"

 NA players: "Oh don't blame your team, you lost because you were not good enough." "You need to talk to them nicely" "If you think your MMR should be higher, that means you would be better than every other player in your match so you have no excuse if you lose. There's no way you can't climb ranked if you are really better" "You are tilted so just take a break." "I don't believe that every single game is like that, you're just exaggerating, get good boi." "Lolol you're just a shit player stop finding excuses."

2016-2017

 NA Players: "Guys Dota is no longer fun anymore, SA players flood our server and ruin our games." "Hey Valve you are destroying this game if you continue to let SA players play on US servers." "Nobody in my team speaks English ermahgerd how does Volvo expect me to win at all like this?" "SA players are intentionally trying to spoil the fun for us NA people. There's no other reason for them to play on US servers, I totally know that because I totally understand how every single person on Earth thinks." "If nothing is done to solve the situation of the US servers, I'm gonna quit Dota. Ha, take that Volvo"

 Me: "Fuck. Off. Really, fuck off. Bunch of hypcritical pussies. Like I'm not even gonna honey my words for this post. Just how fucking self-absorbed can you NA boys get? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (my current 1 only last 2-3 month 1 side no sound)

Then you're not handling it with care. If you don't think that's the case then you'll have to increase your budget. If you don't want to do that too then every 3 months spend $40 on new earphones.

 noise cancellation is maybe if dont have 1 thats under 40$ thats fine. 

Let's just say the cheapest noise cancellation earphones is above $100, typically $200-$300. You get the picture?

	<TEXT> I would like to recommend the ath-e70 over the shure se535LTD if you're willing to spend that much. I was eyeing the se425 or 535 when I stepped into stereo but, after trying them, I have to say that they're not suited for music listening; they're for professional music performers. The vocals on them sound like it can't get any more real on an IEM but the rest of the music are relatively heavily compromised. 

The ath-e70 however gave me the "wow, this is really next-level" feel quickly. Audio technica is kinda notorious for being no-bass but the e70 has clearer bass than the se535. The highs are also very noticeably less punishing, if you get what I mean. Also, the e70 is bulkier and appears less comfortable but it fit my ear much better and has impressive sound isolation. Best part is, it's only around $550 as compared to $779 I think for the se535LTD.

As for westone, I personally feel that their audio output are at their limits even when only driven by a cheap phone soundcard. Also, cheap build quality. I'd actually just recommend the se215SPE over westone IEMs. And if you want a premium upgrade to the 215, the sennheiser ie80 is a good option at $588. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's just so many things wrong with your question. Even after your edits.

You want "good earphones" and your budget is $40. It's like wanting a gaming PC with a $400 budget.

Then you say "dont need high quality, normal quality is fine." So what do you actually want?

And then you mentioned noise cancellation. Friend, do you even know how noise cancellation works? Are you even certain of what "noise cancellation" means and if that's what you're looking for? With $40?
