	<TEXT> There are some circumstances that it becomes an issue though. I mean, I'm a huge believer in not letting things get to you and being in control of your emotions and not letting others control that for you. But some people are just assholes. I dated a guy for a while who was a shit head about it. He'd been smoking 10+ years. I'd been smoking less than a year. But any time he took a hit, I had to take a hit. It was kind of fucked up. Like he would say the worst things to me or tell me he wouldn't be with someone who was too pathetic to handle as much as him. I mean I broke up with him pretty quick. But still. That shit just isn't cool. I got waaaay too high way too many times. I was scared and freaked out all the time because he just pushed too much on me too fast. It's not cool. It should be about sharing the love, not making people uncomfortable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the advice. I guess right now I'm just feeling really scared and overwhelmed about the whole thing and I don't know how I'm going to fit in meetings and things with my new work schedule and school. But I guess you just have to white knuckle it and try not to pick up day to day. The whole things just seems so huge right now. Like the concept of NEVER EVER using again... it's terrifying to me for some reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I go to NA here and there, I guess maybe not as often as I should. I can't do 90 in 90 because of my work schedule. Do you have any other advice for getting through the first little bit? That longest I've made is just over a month. The past few weeks, 2 days is a victory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Economically, it would be HUGE. You could do a three way tax on it. Distributer, seller, and buyer. 
It has numerous health benefits. It has been proven to help slow the development of Alzheimer's and has been used to treat cancers and eating disorders.
Marijuana has zero PHYSICALLY addictive qualities. (that's not to say that you can't become mentally dependent) To counter the argument that it's a "gateway drug" I would argue that the drug itself is not. It's the means by which it's available that leads people to using other drugs. Because it's illegal, you have to go to a drug dealer, who likely also sells other drugs. If marijuana were accessible through legal routes, people would be much less likely to ever come in contact with the other drugs. Also legalizing would make it so you could better regulate it by age and stuff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. Plain and simple, thank you. I've been struggling to let go and believe in a better tomorrow without drugs. I'm back to being only on day 2. But maybe this time it will be my last day 2. I appreciate your words more than you know. much love. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Large rant ahead.. Need to get things off my chest. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-03 11:23:22 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I apologize in advance for the length of this post. But I need help. I've been sporadically posting here for the past few months, in a different mindset each time. But things have gone downhill pretty fast the past little while. A few weeks ago I relapsed after only a little over a month clean. I went 9 days straight fucked up basically all day. Then got upset with myself, went to another NA meeting, and made it 2 days before I made a phone call and landed myself a free script of oxys. It's now 3am the morning of day 2.

I don't know what's been going on with me, what happened that derailed it all. I guess.. I just wasn't ready for the fact that, even though my life was changing completely and turning upside down, the rest of world was just going to keep going. It seems like every where I turn there's another trigger. I'm stressing hard core right now. I have finals coming up. I'm trying to go through the process of a getting a restraining order taken out. 

I don't talk about this very often. It's really personal and I struggle with it. But I feel like it is the main thing impeding my recovery and I need help. When I was 15 I dated a guy who was 18 at the time. He had serious anger issues and a tendency to get aggressive. More often than not I was on the receiving end of the aggression. It went on for about 6 months, came to a head when he decided it didn't matter that I was telling him no and that I was't ready to have sex for the first time. I stayed with him about another month after that. Two years later, another girl pressed charges. I ended up testifying against him. He got out of jail about a month ago and has been making my life a living hell since then. My anxiety has SKYROCKETED since he's been out.

I know everyone has issues. And I know that my struggles sure aren't the worst ones out there. I just don't know how to deal with it without getting stoned. Does anyone have any advice on dealing with life's bullshit as it hits you without falling back into drugs? Sorry for the rant. Thanks for reading.

Sorry for the long post.

Tldr: Having a hard time getting much clean time. Basically I just suck at dealing with life. Any advice on learning to deal with problems and triggers without turning to drugs is greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree. Marijuana has so many medical benefits it's ridiculous. Honestly, it saved my life. It's not even just getting the munchies while I'm baked or whatever. Since I started smoking (and I don't even smoke that frequently. Maybe a couple times a week) my eating disorder has almost completely disappeared, not just the physical part of not eating, but the mental/emotional side of it too. I can't explain what the shift was or why it happened. But it's completely changed my perspective on almost everything. I have so much more self love and acceptance. I don't know what I weigh and I am perfectly fine with it. I didn't think I would ever be able to say that. 

It has had such a positive affect on my life. It makes me so sad that marijuana is cast in such a negative light. It really is such a healing plant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a pretty severe eating disorder from age 12 to about 17. In and out of treatment centers and hospitals. Until I started smoking at 18, I would have thought this post was complete bullshit. Food was far from an experience I enjoyed. I used to be freaked out by the very thought of it. It sounds weird to say, but eating just seemed so unnatural and uncomfortable. Why would I be putting a variety of strange things in my mouth of all places?! But since I started smoking, I appreciate food more than I ever thought possible. It's the best, most amazing experience ever. There are literally thousands and thousands of possible combinations and new things to try. It blows my mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd be careful with that too though. Like.. You don't want him to get addicted to the pills. As someone who is trying to come off a pk addiction, pills are not something you want to fuck with. If you can stop it before the addiction starts, life will be sooo much better. Weed has helped me get through withdrawals and stuff. I don't know. I think it would be a good idea to offer.

	<TEXT> Would you celebrate someone who lost a ton of weight? Why should I be happy for them when I wasn't stupid enough to become overweight in the first place??

Same dame concept. This is an ignorant thing to say. You never know what someone went through that made them turn to drugs. Maybe their parents were drug addicts and the only time they had any contact with their parents was if they were getting stoned with them. Are you in any position to tell a 14 year old that they shouldn't want to spend time with their parents, no matter what it takes? If you haven't been there, don't make try to pass a judgement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy Shit. Maybe I should try this with my dog.. He has horrible anxiety. He'll hyperventilate and chew on his feet when he gets nervous. If there's a a new situation for an extended period of time he'll chew on his feet/legs until they bleed and we have to bandage them up and stuff. It's really the saddest thing I've ever seen. Maybe I'll give it a try.. Unless anyone knows of any adverse effects cannabis has on various animals that is. I'm definitely going to have to do some research on the subject. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I had the weirdest thought last night.. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-25 06:52:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I was with a couple friends last night, and, after a couple bowls, we settled in to watch a movie. I was probably at a solid 8, higher than I've been in a while. About 20 minutes into the movie, I decided I wanted to cuddle with my friend laying on the floor. Even though I hate being the big spoon, it was the most readily open position. So I snuggled up to him, and immediately the thought came into my head that I was just like a baby koala on it's mama's back. Even at the time, I knew that was fucking weird. But still, I couldn't shake the thought and feeling that we were just like two little koalas. 

And that's how I drifted off to sleep, imagining and feeling like I was a baby koala. It was weird. But somehow, I still woke up feeling more rested than I have in weeks. huh.

Peace and love homies. </TEXT>
