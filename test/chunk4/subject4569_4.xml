	<TEXT> I think a medium wash is the most versatile because you can pair it with dark or light denims, as well as various chinos.

From what I remember, those truckers have funny sizing so a lot of people go with a slim to avoid it being boxy in the body.

No way to know for sure without trying it on, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, I misread on the sleeve thing. I roll sleeves when it gets a little warm or when I'm working with my hands. If you're going to roll sleeves just make sure that you aren't ending up with a massive cuff. YouTube should help with that.

As long as your shorts fit correctly and they're only a little above the knee, no one is going to be seeing much of your thigh. If you want to play it safe then buy a pair that hits the knee and cuff them to see if you like them shorter. </TEXT>
