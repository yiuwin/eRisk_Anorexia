	<TEXT> That's a good point about Hyperbole and a Half. I didn't even think of it.  Probably more appropriate for this round, too.  Glad you pointed out it was an option, I'll be sure to vote for it.  I bought her book nearly a year ago and I still haven't read it.  

I've never thought about a graphic novel version of a "normal" story, but I'm seeing some options like that, and I'm really intrigued by the notion.  I hope one is selected.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome, thanks: 

So if I were on a calf raise machine, for example, that said, "Starting resistance = 30 pounds" and I placed 30 pounds of weights on the machine, would I be lifting 60 pounds?  

I just found it kind of hard to follow because I go to three different gyms that have three different calf press machines. One doesn't list a starting resistance. One lists one of 35 and one lists one of 60.  The first one always feels way heavier than the other two if I put 60 pounds on it.  The last one feels WAY too light if I don't put weights on it, but 60 pounds is ~ where I'm at right now, so I don't want to falsely think I'm able to lift more and then I can.  

Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to open a conversation thread to discuss the options in the suggestions thread.  I feel like there would definitely be a benefit to having a kind of companion piece where we can talk without things getting lost in the random shuffle of contest mode. 

I'll start with a question.  I really wanted to nominate this series for the topic: https://www.goodreads.com/series/57441-welcome-to-the-nhk but I was unaware it was in 8 books.  This is obviously not a cheap solution, and price has been mentioned as a factor in this particular phase.  

Do we even want to be nominating series? Or are we to stick to one volume?  Maybe treating that week as an introduction to a series and if the reader so chooses, they can continue on with it in their own time?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got into a debate yesterday on whether or not this book was fantasy/sci-fi and was told to wait until I finish it and then I'd see how wrong I was (that it was not really a sci-fi).

Sticking to my guns.  To dismiss this book as a sci-fi completely misses the point.  The idea isn't to focus on whether or not what happens at the end could happen in reality.  The idea was to show the dangers of a mind unbridled by the question of whether or not someone should do what they're doing.  The "fiction" of the science is hardly the point.  And it wasn't really posed that fictionally to begin with.

Loved this book.  Really loved how hard it hit you, and how suddenly, with the final destination for all of the fate-based building.  

Great read. Giving it a 4/5 on Goodreads, more like an 8.5/10 by my own rating system. </TEXT>

That's a good point, we could just start a thread now, there's no reason not to.  Maybe when I get home tonight, if I'm feeling initiative I will.

	<TEXT> I made a suggestion in the new sticky thread about the way we nominate books. I think it would be worthwhile to have a period of discussion before the actual voting so we can converse, defend and champion for certain selections. A book primary, if you will. It might be an interesting method to getting people to branch out. 

As for using the word fantasy to describe books... Well... Most nonfiction books are fantasy when you get right down to it. So it's easy to apply the tag.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My comment was blunter than it could have been and I apologize for that.  But what I mean is that there is voting, it's not like a handful of people are being louder than the majority and getting the books they want picked. 

Yes, exploring is good, but for me, I'm already going WAY out of my comfort zone with this.  I really stick to horror and sci-fi novels from the last 50 years, for the most part.  I love to read, but I know what I like, and reading takes time.  

Yes, a lot of these books have sci-fi elements, but let's be real, Dick has WAY more sci-fi than High Castle, Cat's Cradle just eludes to sci-fi, there's a kind of magic in Dorian Gray and Lolita is Lolita.  I'd be hard pressed to agree that any of the books this month were sci-fi, and while they were written by white men, they certainly are different. 

I've recommended books from Japan, from women, from men, etc, but if they don't get picked, they don't get picked. I'm always free to read what I want in the end anyways, and thanks to the submission thread, I have SO many options to choose from. 

There's discussion threads for what other books you're reading, and you could always start a thread on a book you're interested in, I don't think anyone would decry more discussion here, I certainly wouldn't.  

I'm finding myself sufficiently challenged by the entire task, but when there's a book I have read (next month, there are two such examples) then I crack my knuckles and dive into finding something in a genre I don't like (comedy) that I think I might find interesting.  And when I do, I'll post about it here in the alternate book thread and hopefully there will be some fun discussion.  

I just want people to talk and converse about books because they're great, and not argue about who the authors are.  That's all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just mentioned it in another thread, but there's got to be a better way to do the nominations thread.  The way it is now, if the books weren't nominated by the time someone goes to vote, trying to come back and see what was added to the selection is nearly impossible.  Is there somewhere we could place suggestions throughout the month (I.E. throughout February a thread would've existed welcoming submission ideas for Graphic Novels) and then on the day actual voting begins, launch a new thread with a post for each submission?  That way they're all there at once? Plus it would welcome conversation over the course of the month about book options, give people a chance to make a case for them, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part of it for me was that I've been trying to be better about not using an internal monologue when reading, but some of these books, like this one and No Country's lack of punctuation, makes it harder for my eyes to focus on the right things without reading internally, so I reread twice as much.  In the end, it would've been better if I'd just read High Castle normally.  

Still really enjoyed it. I think it's my favorite book of the lot, thusfar, this being a close second and Princess Bride a not-too-distant third. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone, 

I wish I'd known about this sub ages ago.  I found it, coincidentally, yesterday when I finally got back to my lowest weight ever.  It was a great day, a great motivator, and finding this place to post about it also made me feel pretty great. 

When I started really changing the way I eat and behave with regards to food and exercise, I was at about 190 pounds.  I couldn't believe how big I was, but when I saw a picture a cousin had taken of me in an unflattering shirt, I realized I'd been deluding myself into thinking that I wasn't *that* big.  I was.  

This was in 2013.  Over the following months I made it down to around 145 pounds. I was ecstatic.  And then I quit my job.  I quit my job, and fell into a pretty bad depression.  I moved cross country to follow my dreams, and managed to actually find that to be a doable pursuit.  I was feeling better, happier, working, and I knew it was time to get back in shape. 

At the start of 2015 I was back up to 170 pounds.  In May, I hit 135.  I was so happy.  I was no longer "obese", I was fitting into smaller clothes, gaining some muscle, etc.  But then I started gaining weight.  It would yoyo between 136 and 142, but never did it  get back to 135 again.  I was confused, flustered,upset, etc. I joined a gym, hoping that would be the answer, and started trying to build lean muscle.   The weight started going down again, but not by much.  Again, 136 was the plateau. 

Anyways, long story short: The holidays came, I stopped going to the gym, tried to count calories, and get through a busy time at work, without gaining too much. I got back up to 145, and was happy it wasn't worse than that.  Now I'm back in the gym, a member of a few subs, reading more scientific articles, understanding that I was snacking too much, and eating back my workout calories too often, and now I'm back on track.  Bought a Fitbit, following it's calorie limitations, not snacking outside of my designated snack times (no grabbing a couple of chocolate covered almonds at work anymore) and drinking a LOT more water.

And here I am, back at 135. I'm so happy.  I feel great. I am determined and I realize I CAN do this.  It's a great feeling.  

So, sorry if that was tl;dr.  I just wanted to get all of that out of my system.  See you around!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None of it matters, the way people on this sub have been talking about Arlovski lately. It's really disappointing.  Guy was really back into it, and in all likelihood could've been looking at a title shot, if the UFC hadn't pushed this Cain thing so hard, or if there were fights for the HW belt more often, taken your pick. 

I'm glad he's getting his opportunity, and I hope he can bounce back with it.  If he can't, it proves to me that Overeem has certainly earned a shot as well, but I think one has to remember that he did get owned by Rothwell, so I'm not sure why everyone's so insistent he get a title shot NOW.  </TEXT>

It quickly became obvious to me that not everyone was seeing what I was, then, boom, recollection.  Which leads me to realize that I'm not good about being a beta if I never stop in to comment on how things are going. 

This is taking a little while to get used to, but I think I like it.  Haven't run into any bugs yet, either.  Will be great to see how this can expand in the future.   </TEXT>

If he'd actually written you only live once, I think I'd've died right there in the gym where I was reading it.
