I find that no one really cares what I am drinking. So I drink what I like when I go to bars: Shirley Temples.

That being said, non-alcoholic beer has some alcohol in it. It would be breaking my sobriety to consciously choose to consume anything with alcohol in it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok I was wrong then!

I don't go to AA anymore, but I did.

I maintain a dry house, unless we have friends coming over, then I don't mind. I had booze at my wedding when I was 2.5 years sober. I go to bars for dinner. I go to parties. I work around alcohol.

I say I am in recovery from substance abuse. I don't call myself an alcoholic anymore. I used to. I prefer to label myself as "in recovery" because that's a more accurate representation than saying I have a drinking problem and using a term that is outdated. 

I do avoid trace amounts of alcohol. This is purely because of habit, I've been doing it since day 1 and don't really see any point of adding small quantities of alcohol back into my life. It doesn't make sense. The purported health benefits of kombucha are outweighed by the fact that there is alcohol in there. 

I do not feel at risk of relapse. That sounds cocky. But I am sure of my beliefs, goals, and dreams in life. I check in with myself everyday, I maintain open and honest lines of communication with my husband, family and friends and I do work that helps me stay humble. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still learning to deal with money. Something I do that helps me from impulse buying is to kind of check in with how I am feeling mentally before I go out. Like, if I am grumpy or cranky, and I do shopping, I'm at more of a risk to buy shit I don't need. Sometimes just saying "I am cranky and I think this shit will change how I feel" stops the impulse to buy.

Other times I need to actually give myself barriers. Not bringing my debit card, or bringing a certain amount of money. 

It's easier said than done. I think what has helped me the most is saving for big things. Right now, I am all about saving 100 dollars a month so that I can secretly buy my husband a Lazy-Boy chair. 

So really, I mentally check in and name the feeling. Then I'll physically limit access, and the biggest thing is having larger plans and making a very simple process for getting there.

Sorry that was so long haha </TEXT>

I will relapse if I stop being true to myself and my word. I will relapse if I start doing what everyone thinks I should and stop engaging in the life I envision for my self.

I decided to go all in. I became open, honest and willing.

I guess I sort of tricked myself into quitting. A very small part of me wanted it. I got a lot of support, did a lot of hard work, soul searching and a lot of practical things...and that small part became bigger and bigger. Now I cannot imagine my life as a drinker. It doesn't fit with who I am as a person. </TEXT>

But I mean, whatever works. 

The thing is, I can become obsessive about anything that is rewarding. I've got passionate and obsessive tendencies. And it obviously got me into trouble.

For me, quitting drinking was a jumping off point for changing the way I interacted with the world. Instead of changing one thing for another, I started going, "Wait, how is this serving me? What do I value and believe in? What can I channel this addictive tendency towards that is healthy and helpful?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just wonder about the state that someone is left in when approached about their problem.

OP mentioned living in a different country and seeing them randomly, and it seems like times where people might imbibe more. Holidays, get togethers with old friends. 

As well, I feel like it's irresponsible to plant a seed "Hey man I'm concerned that every time I see you, you're talking about drinking" and then just leave. I feel like if you are going to try to burst someone's bubble, you need to at least be available or have resources for them to continue their journey. Not just a "I think you have a problem, see you next Christmas" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gotta be honest. Getting to one year was okay, but it's more the quality of life I have. The time accumulated isn't much of a reward anymore.

Expecting to feel accomplished when I do something sets me up for being disappointed. I like to focus on living better today, and setting myself up for success. </TEXT>

I bet your intentions are in the right place, but this is his personal business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some people like repetition. Others don't. There are other options out there if you'd like to stop. I used inpatient rehab as my starter, then branched out into outpatient group therapy that was run by professionals. They always made sure the topic was new, and the group dynamic got really close. It was an amazing experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds difficult. I know that for me feeling connected with people has been the most important thing in recovery. I felt so alone, different and alienated when I was drinking.

When I got into recovery, I made a conscious effort to hang out with other sober people. Sooner or later, I started feeling like part of the regular human race again...I stopped seeing us as "alcoholics vs. normies" and started realizing that we all had our shit. Being in recovery from substance abuse doesn't make me abnormal. We're all recovering from something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I have carried around my baggage, trauma, pain and anger because it makes me feel entitled to act and behave in certain ways.

I am in love with the quote by Najwa Zebian: "These mountains that you are carrying, you were only supposed to climb"

I carry around things, events, moments, hates, loves, likes...when maybe, If I let it go...who knows what would happen.

For me there is a difference between letting things go after I have worked through them, and avoidance. For example, some trauma I've been through...I don't go "It doesn't affect me anymore"...that's not fair. It might. Instead, I don't carry around the story anymore and let it define my life. Same with substance abuse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Daily Mail has just written a blurb on SD. Usually they ask the mods for permission, but not this time!

I guess Recovery.org has done a bunch of research on us...without our consent or knowledge (I know, reddit is open to everyone).

I'm both saddened and enlivened by SD press!

	<TEXT> Speaking from the I means speaking from experience. We don't give direct advice on SD. It comes from a peer support model of recovery. I don't know you. You knoq you. Me telling you what to do and how to think isnt what we do on sd. So we tell our story, share what worked for us.

Instead of saying "you need to look at it like this" (which is an attempt to set someone straight), we say "I look at it like this"

 The challenging part just isn't supporting. It's directly telling someone "this is what I believe you need"

 Hope that clarifies. Yes we take this place very seriously. I know it sounds intense, but we've grown a lot because of the way we approach one another.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I fell out of favour with the ideas and beliefs that were behind the AA program. I also felt like it was very cliquey. I tried to go to different meetings and got involved in service, but it stopped feeling right.

I was also confused. I was told that if I stopped going to AA meetings, I'd relapse. That sounded irrational to me. Like, why would I need to continue to go to meetings for the rest of my life? Could I find something else that worked for me, that kept me aware of my problem, but didn't require me to somehow KEEP identifying as an alcoholic day after day?

I was also realizing that people on SD had never gone to AA and had stayed sober. Then I started to learn and read about substance abuse, and the theories behind it...and I realized there was more to do than a simple disease model.

So, it was a lot of things that accumulated over time.

Now I work in the substance abuse field, I volunteer with substance abuse organizations, I got training in peer support, and use SD as my support. I am happy and feel more well rounded than I did when I was in AA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New Years.

For many of us, New Years brings a fresh slate, a clean start to a whole new year. It provides motivation to start new behaviours and end old ones that may not be serving us anymore.

On SD, we are here to support and encourage each other in our attempts and successes to cut down or quit drinking.

Regardless of your goal, where you are, or how ambivalent you are...you are welcome here.

The [FAQ and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index) are a fantastic place to start. It includes commonly asked questions such as

- Why aren't people giving me direct advice?

- What's with speaking from your experience? Isn't it easier to just tell people how it is?

- Why aren't people giving me tips on how to cut down my drinking?

- Why are there so many non-drinkers here, where are the moderate ones?

- What are badges, what are those stars and numbers? What do they mean?

There are hundreds of resources out there. As part of my New Year Resolution plan, I actually follow SAMHSA's 8 Dimensions of Wellness, and have written down and mapped out a solid plan for me. [Here is what I use, pages 8-19](http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/health-wellness/wellness-strategies/wellness.pdf)

There is also

- AA

- SMART recovery

- Refuge Recovery

- Inpatient and outpatient treatment

- Finding a substance abuse counsellor

- Using exercise, nutrition or meditation

- Any combination and anything that works for you

Happy New Year and WELCOME!!!! </TEXT>
