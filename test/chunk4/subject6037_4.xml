Maybe they meant the oldest cathedral, St Paul's is just a basilica. A cathedral has a higher designation, but I abandoned religion a long time ago so I forget what the differences are. Something to do with the Bishop.

A basilica outranks a cathedral (http://www.bible.ca/catholic-church-hierarchy-organization.htm). See the list under this subheading:

Pretty sure St. Paul's Basilica is the 'oldest Roman Catholic congregation in Toronto, Ontario, Canada' (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul%27s_Basilica). As far as I know it's still being used for its original purpose. In fact, it's where the parishioners of St. Mikes went during the renovations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure Ryan used the phrase 'open source' or at least the word 'open' so I don't think it's you. Can someone else clarify?

So really the issue I have is with the use of antivirus software and the open source movement as a plot device. After thinking about it I realize they needed a product that Joe could sell using fear (as in getting a virus on your PC) as a motivator then swoop in like a saviour with a 'cure' - his software.

But the problem is the time line. Antivirus software was already being distributed for free via BBSs (ironically this was also the main source of viruses pre WWW). And as I mentioned releasing the code as an 'open source' move probably wouldn't have had any real impact.

Edit: spelling and grammar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Open source was not a really a thing in the time period in which the show takes place. As you can see here:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_open-source_software

there was only about 6 open source projects in the 1980s. It just wasn't part of the culture at the time.

Programmers made shareware or freeware basically as a hobby and distributed it via a BBS. This is exactly how McAfee started:

"The company distributes its antiviral and utilities programs on bulletin board services..."

Source:

https://books.google.ca/books?id=rjsEAAAAMBAJ pg=PA98 lpg=PA98 dq=mcafee+software+history+as+shareware source=bl ots=FUrjroPLes sig=ouahfDSHnJEIH2MheprLDk_q6SQ hl=en sa=X ved=0ahUKEwj6rajdqbPPAhViL8AKHZ4cDx4Q6AEILjAJ#v=onepage q=mcafee%20software%20history%20as%20shareware f=false

I'm not sure where the writers are going with this.  We understand the implications of what was done in present time as the outcome could be quite different. But back then code released in this fashion could easily be overlooked. No one would really care, especially if there was already a shareware/freeware anti-virus program that was popular.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are numerous buildings associated with Consumer's Gas in Old Town Toronto.

The main Consumer's Gas Building is located on 19 Toronto Street:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers%27_Gas_Building

This is not visible in the photograph posted.

There is also the Consumer Gas Company Station A, which was located at 51 Parliament Street at Mill Street. It's now the headquarters for TPS 51 Division. This is also not visible in this photograph.

There was another another Consumer Gas Building at 26 Berkeley St, which is now the Canadian Stage Company:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Stage_Company

Quoted from this link:

"The historic Berkeley Street Theatre complex contains two performance spaces, as well as a large rehearsal space, props and wardrobe facilities, and the companys administrative offices. The Berkeley site was originally built by the Consumers Gas Corporation in 1887 as part of a gas pumping station complex. The Berkeley Downstairs Theatre was originally a pump room and served in that capacity until 1955, when Consumers Gas moved their production out of downtown Toronto."

I believe is is this building that can be seen just east of the Elias Rogers  amp; Co. 

Another view of this particular building, which was located at The Esplanade and Berkeley can be seen here:

	<TEXT> Some very good points here. Do you see the Greenbelt Plan in any way accommodating these? 

What I mean is there are already issues with farming as you've pointed out. In your opinion does the Greenbelt Plan (or the Places to Grow Act) in anyway help address these? 

I'm thinking that if the Greenbelt Plan isn't working and farming already has other issues, which may be increasing and that make it a very challenging lifestyle/career path then I think there's an even bigger problem here. </TEXT>

I'd argue that farming isn't a dying occupation. It's just that farmland has been under constant assault from development, skyrocketing land values, and speculators. 

I was thinking more along the lines that farming has ceased to be profitable years ago as more food was being imported and sold cheaper at grocery stores. This, along with droughts, pest problems and other reasons for bad crop outcomes meant that more were leaving this type of work. It wasn't seen as profitable and too risky so parents in farming families were encouraging their children to pick other careers. 

Another issue, albeit a very rare one is the tobacco farmers like those in the Simcoe, Ontario area. As the pressure to reduce smoking increases the need for tobacco decreases. I believe some farmers have switched to growing asparagus in this area as this grows well in soil normally used for tobacco. But this may not be as profitable. So in this case it's market demand, or lack thereof that might put these farmers out of business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My (perhaps overly simplistic) understanding of this is that it's main purpose is to increase urban density, that is to build housing like condos that have a smaller footprint and can house hundreds of people rather than a dozen or so in the same space. These are to be in an already built up urban environment, which would cut costs on implementing services (municipal like water, roadways, transportation and federal like postal services). 

The flip side of this is to protect farmland from being used to develop new housing subdivisions, which would cost a lot of money to add new to services to. This is also to promote locally grown food in the farmland areas, which are no longer being used for new subdivisions.

However I seriously doubt this is the case. Developers are making money putting up poorly built condos in overly dense areas in order to quickly cash in on this. I don't think proper impact or environmental studies are being completed. Transit and transportation are suffering as a result. Also there's now an incredible strain on the infrastructure (evident in water mains breaking, electrical outages, pot holes) that no one seems to notice or care about. 

Further, I don't know how much support there is for farmers, whether that includes those currently in this occupation or recruiting new people to start working is this area. I thought farming was a dying occupation and in many cases new generations have left as there's no future in it. I don't think this Growth Plan is opening up so many new opportunities that people are flocking to farming. The growth industry seems to be condo construction. 

In addition, there's already been a few instances in which regions have tried to circumvent the Growth Plan:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_Plan_for_the_Greater_Golden_Horseshoe#Official_Plan_Amendment_Case_Studies

And various criticisms have been put forth:

	<TEXT> I think part of the whole "start over" thing regardless of why is to cut all ties with your former life including changing your name (it would make it difficult to maintain your medical or academic credentials as noted above), leave your family, friends and to move to another state. 

Once you've relocated you're expected to "lie low" or your cover would be blown. This is to protect you. Although working as a physician is not generally considered to be high profile there could be situations in your job where you are required to speak to the press, have your photo taken for some fundraising thing, etc. If this were the case with Jo she would likely have to say something to the hospital administration as to why she can't do this or she would be exposed.

	<TEXT> I've heard many mothers say their first born child is their favourite. Not saying anyone's negative experience as a first born is invalid. 

"Most parents have a favourite child and it's likely to be their first-born, study finds"

http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/study-finds-more-than-two-thirds-of-parents-have-a-favourite-child-and-its-probably-their-first-born-a6978911.html

There are other studies out there with similar results.

Often all the resources do into the first born and they're most likely to succeed later in life. Subsequent children are almost like an after thought. The first born passes all the milestones, like walking and talking, graduating from school, etc. first. When the others do the same it's not as big a deal. Most first borne have many photos taken of them as children. Other subsequent siblings often less so.

Two sports examples I can think of: Wayne Gretzky, great hockey player and first born. His other brothers didn't even make it to the NHL. Another sports example: John McEnroe, first born and an extremely successful tennis player. Younger brother Patrick didn't come close. Other younger brother Mark didn't even bother trying to play tennis.

I'm an only child so I'm just an observer of this phenomena. </TEXT>

The downvote tells you nothing other than perhaps someone disagrees or doesn't like what you posted (found it offensive, for example). 

When someone neither upvotes or downvotes little information about their perspective is conveyed other than perhaps they have no option. 

We also have no way of knowing how many have read any one post overall. This could be an interesting metric.

Perhaps if the upvote/downvote both required comments then we could engage in a more progressive discourse. </TEXT>

May be they will get few more locations to set up discounted fare accounts, after all they will have to do something with those collectors that they wont need. May be it will be done via mail, or even online.who knows..

I believe you need documentation to be approved for the discount. This needs to be done by a person. In person. One who is trained to examine the requisite documents not collect fairs in the booth.

	<TEXT> Quoted from article, "The value of having Presto for seniors and students who routinely ride the TTC is that theyre able to add a concession on the self-service fare card. This is a feature that allows customers to apply discounts. By default, the card is set to the adult fare, and in order to have their discount applied, riders only have one option: they have to visit Davisville station. While making the trip to Davisville is a one-time burden to get approved for discounted fares, having only the one option raises concerns for people who rely on transit to travel through the GTA, especially those with mobility issues"

So you have to pay to get to the Davisville station (if it's not already your stop) in order to get the discount? Spend money to save money.

	<TEXT> I agree it's getting tedious. I think people are just so amazed at how TM pulls it all off now they just want to see more. I personally would like more time spent on the clones we already have rather than introducing more.

You may want to check out the clip at this link:

The question about new clones is asked near the end of the interview and deftly handled.

there's so many classist implications with 'sophisticated and worldly'. do you mean rich/middle class? 

Not necessarily. Just someone who can show Ian there's a different world out there. It could be something completely different like joining the Peace Corp and doing volunteer work in a developing nation.

I don't recall anyone begrudging Lip for trying to make his life different by going to college.

	<TEXT> I can see (and agree with to a certain extent) the appeal to have them as endgame. However, I'd be concerned that Ian would have very little to learn from Mickey, at least in a good way. If Ian were to meet someone more sophisticated and worldly I believe it would be healthier for him long term. Now if Mickey comes back they could maintain a close, supportive friendship that would be beneficial to both (but probably not as emotionally satisfying to the viewers). I think Mickey knows Ian the best and vice versa. But I don't know if this means they should be together. </TEXT>

here is his underhand serve against Lendl

Watched this match live. It was beyond words. Lendl looked like a fool losing to a kid so overcome by cramps he had to serve underhand. 

Lendl was considered to be a joke on the tour at the time. When he finally won the US Open after making it to the finals for the 3 previous years he was so overcome he ran into the tunnel used to access the court and puked. 

Most of the criticism was likely due to his personality (or lack thereof). He was certainly a talented player but man was he disliked by tennis fans. </TEXT>

Kira's special whatever is called her "woo woo" by the writers. Personally, that sounds like they're referring to genitals but whatevs. 

According to the Urban Dictionary 'woo woo' is "Unfounded or ludicrouse beliefs" and in, "Belief in talking to the dead, belief in telikenesis, in fact any belief not founded on good evidence, the poorer the evidence the more Woo Woo the belief"

http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=woo%20woo

Sounds like the antithesis to the scientific work done by Cosima et al. </TEXT>

How has he achieved anything in his career thus far? He surrounds himself with talented people that he poaches ideas from and turns them into money making ventures.

I'm not saying he doesn't have any skills. It's just that his skill set does not require that he's able to create a product or service. He hires other people to do that. He knows how to maneuvure, manipulate and market it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's possible that the actor who plays Art, Kevin Hanchard may have been busy with other productions. He does a fair amount of theatre, which isn't really reflected in his IMDB profile.

Wasn't he only in a handful of episodes in season 3? (maybe this was just a side effect of the main story for that season). Then it became useful story-wise to give his character a bit of back history for the Beth focussed episode in season 4 so he was in more episodes.

Edit to add: To be fair there's a lot of characters in this show and I don't mean just the clones so I'm sure it's hard to balance character development with story telling.  </TEXT>
