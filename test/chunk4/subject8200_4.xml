A preacher said, "Anyone with 'special needs' who wants to be prayed over, please come forward to the front by the altar."

With that, Leroy got in line and when it was his turn, the Preacher asked, "Leroy, what do you want me to pray about for you?" 

Leroy replied, "Preacher, I need you to pray for help with my hearing." 
The preacher put one finger of one hand in Leroy's ear, placed his other hand on top of Leroy's head and then  prayed and prayed and prayed. 
He prayed a "blue streak" for Leroy and the whole congregation joined in with great enthusiasm.
 
After a few minutes, the preacher removed his hands, stood back and asked, "Leroy, how is your hearing now?"
Leroy answered, "I don't know.  It ain't 'til next week."

My "friend" actually asked my wife at the bowling alley about that night, about three weeks later. I never spoke with him after that. I kinda regret that now, because he does a couple of years later.

	<TITLE> One hot summer day, a blonde came to town with her dog </TITLE>

	<TEXT> 
One hot summer day, a blonde came to town with her dog, tied it under the shade of a tree, and headed into a restaurant for something cold to drink. Twenty minutes later, a policeman entered the restaurant and asked, 'Who owns the dog tied under that tree outside?                                                                                                                                      
 
The blonde said it was hers. 'Your dog seems to be in heat' the officer said.

The blonde replied, 'No way. She's cool 'cause she's tied up under that shade tree.
 
The policeman said, 'No! You don't understand. Your dog needs to be bred.
 
'No way,' said the blonde. 'My dog doesn't need bread. She isn't hungry 'cause I fed her this morning.
 
The exasperated policeman said, 'NO! You don't understand. Your dog wants to have sex!
 
(You have to love this)
 
The blonde looked at the cop and said, 'Well, go ahead. I always wanted a police dog.

	<TEXT> I worked with a few Germans in the 70's who fought against us in WWII and it was so uncomfortable standing next to them during Remembrance Day Ceremonies. They just did as all of did, bowed and stood in silence for 2 min. It was so awkward, because Canadian vets were also present. The Vets sort of stayed in their own group. This post just reminded me of that experience.  </TEXT>
