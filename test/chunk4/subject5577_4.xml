	<TEXT> That makes no sense to say that God can't do certain things God obviously controls everything God made logic to be 2+2=4 but God could have made it to be different just since God made things in a certain way we can't comprehend how that would be and in regards to the possibility of doing bad that is obviously within gods will and power you can't say that God is only God over certain things.

God obviously does not control us that is the advantage of man over animal that we have brain power not just specific attributes like a raven is an animal with the attribute of strength and hunting which go into the same category since hunting comes from strength or like a dovevis peaceful meaning all animals are limited only to their unique and specific attributes that God created them with but humans have the power of their brain that they can have many different attributes and make their own decisions unlike animals that don't have free choice. And God made the world to be in a state of good and evil in order that we should pick the good and through the good we can push away the darkness like a small candle in a large dark room or to purify the world through using the bad and turning it over to goodness 

Obvioulsy the bad is also in gods control and by doing bad itblifts you up higher like in order to jump high you have to bend down. Obviously bad is bad and good is good but everything is all in hids will and desire </TEXT>
