	<TEXT> /r/TWRP actually came out with a new album last month and the cover is heavily [inspired by Signalnoise's work](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4126128372_10.jpg) (Signalnoise is his pen name. It's what he goes by on everything.)

	<TEXT> As much as I love NSP and all the collabs, I think I prefer TWRP on their own. That new No Pants Dance is an exception though... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perogies? I'm sold.  

Yeah, I've heard they've had some issues with accidentally double booking shows? I could be wrong, but I think that's what's been happening.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on what you're looking for!  

Like Hex mentioned, 1Shirt hosts TWRP's official merchandise, but they've been closed for a while because they're moving studios, as far as I know. Alternatively, if you're ever at one of their Live shows they always have t-shirts available at their merch table there!   

If you're looking for fanmade work, I believe there are a few designs available on [redbubble](http://www.redbubble.com/shop/twrp) if you search TWRP over there. Also, I've recently taken up screenprinting at home and have [a few designs](http://subject811.storenvy.com/) available for purchase myself.  


That's all I know of so far! </TEXT>
