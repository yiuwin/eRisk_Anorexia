	<TITLE> average battery life on a 'new' surface pro 2? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-25 05:09:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> i bought a 'new' surface pro 2 from the staples 'clearance/sell off' a few weeks ago from slickdeals.  i full wiped and fresh installed windows 10.  all drivers are up to date.  i have a type cover 2 plugged in.  i get about 4 hours of use.  i did a check and its a brand new battery.  is this average?  Maybe the battery lost its mojo sitting around for several years on the shelf in the back room of staples?  I know Intel said they were working with microsoft on windows 10 battery life.  I never used windows 8 on the surface long enough to really gauge if it had better battery on it.  thanks for your responses! </TEXT>
