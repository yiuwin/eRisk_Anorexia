The owner of the company would never pay for someone external and expects me to do it as I'm working at this place anyway. He's done it before with other ventures he's had and I was new. naive and fresh out of Uni so I just did extra work. </TEXT>

Saying that though my very first play of the game last year I also did beat Vicar Amelia first time and thought nothing of it... until I tried on another save and I don't know how the fuck I ever did it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just downloaded the game and I noticed something that's kind of annoying unless I'm being stupid. I played for about 5 minutes and bought an egg that had 30 minutes to hatch so I turned the game of and went back to ~~working~~ reddit.

Fast forward 30 minutes and I get the notification that the egg was ready to hatch. I load the game back up but I couldn't get back to the egg unless I played the game and lost, then the option to hatch the egg came up.

I'm not sure if you can get to eggs without playing and failing? or if you can maybe it needs to be more obvious.

Apart from that though so far it seems like a pretty cool game and it looks great! (playing on a Nexus 5X / Nougat: 7.1.1) </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-03-09 12:48:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I currently work in marketing doing graphics and the odd web design (HTML/CSS). Like most people here I grew up playing and loving video games and I always wanted to get into making something myself but never knew where to start and didn't think it would be something I couldn't really learn as a teenager.

I'm 29 now and missed the opportunity to learn game dev while I was younger such as going college/university. (I did study Graphic Design at university though so not a million miles away).

I want to practice/learn in my own time so I can make something myself, whether it be a 2D or 3D game (preferably 2D as I have the required tools for that). I can handle the graphical side of game dev but I really don't know where to start in terms of learning to code - what coding language is best?

I've searched around online but I don't want to waste my time learning something that will only work with one program or piece of software, such as a "2D game maker" that is a drag and drop sort of thing. I want to be able to learn a coding language that I can apply to other software if possible.

I did download Unity but I'm not sure if this is the "go to" software for 2D game dev? also it's overwhelming if you don't know what you're doing.

**TL;DR: I want to teach myself 2D game development but I feel overwhelmed at where to start in terms of coding languages etc. Any tips or websites to point me in the right direction would amazing and I'd be very grateful**  </TEXT>
