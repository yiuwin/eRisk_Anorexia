This is before I accidentally gave my sister an adult ticket and I took the child ticket. She scanned through as an adult, and then said I could not come in, even though it was clear we mixed up the tickets. Took about 20 minutes for the problem to be dealt with, missing the first 5 minutes of the match.

You will not find a large news outlet which does not work with PR agencies. It is tough to be successful without one. You can't really lose them or your business will be fucked. You have nothing to write about.

	<TEXT> Why is it the 'least desirable and least respectable profession in the modern era'. Is this because of what a certain somebody has told you?

And no, the editor would not be told what he/she can publish. The PR company for the person that we are about to report on my say "if you report on this, we will never work with you again", which is not the government trying to stifle anything. This is something which occurs in every country in the world. The editor will then need to way up whether they can make more money publishing or make more money working with the PR company. This has happened a LOT. Gay footballers, for instance. Journalists know who the gay footballers are, but they will not release the names because the PR companies will threaten with not working with them again. This means cutting off a massive source of revenue. Again, something that happens in other countries.

But hey, you are insulting my profession and not 100% sure why. Sum your arguments, because it certainly is not least-desirable as more people than ever are getting into journalism.

	<TEXT> Don't be a crackpot. Free speech exists in the UK.

You *can't* say something which threatens violence against another group.

You can say:

"I hate Muslims"

You can't say:

"Go and kill all Muslims"

You want people to be free to go out there and threaten violence against other people? You can say whatever you want apart from that. That is fair.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yesterday I had an argument with a Canadian.

I provided him with a SHIT ton of evidence that he was wrong, but he was not buying it and said I was spreading 'fake news'.

It is really irritating sometimes.

A while back, I made a post on rape in Sweden. Got thousands upon thousands of upvotes in /r/bestof and I got 3 gilds. Yet, some /r/the_donald posters decided to work out who I was and send me my address in a threatening manner.
