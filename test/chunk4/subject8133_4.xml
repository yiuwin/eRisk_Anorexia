	<TEXT> Well I plugged them straight into the reciever yesterday and loaded up Spotify and first impressions were not very good. Then I realised I had the free version of spotify which has a lower quality than premium?

But I did some ps4 gaming, watched a movie and I can't fault them. Very comfortable and amazing sound quality. This is my first decent pair of headphones so I'm impressed. I paid $260 AUD for mine but they are worth every penny. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can tell you how it sounds tomorrow :) Still waiting for the post. The reason I would to run the 598's through my receiver is, I'd imagine the quality is much better than running through the controller? I don't know. I'm a noob when it comes to audio setups. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm confused about this cable. If I only want to plug the mic into the controller, why would I need this splitter? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Headphones for PS4, do I need an amp? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking of getting either Sennheiser HD558 or the 598. Would I need an amp along with this or will plugging straight into the controller sound decent? If an amp is preferable, any suggestions?
Clip on mic suggestions with this setup would be welcomed as well.
Cheers! </TEXT>
