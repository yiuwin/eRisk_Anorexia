	<TEXT> Thanks for the tips guys  . Since birth I have been overweight, I have been called names , and poked at for all my life. My mom bought a tread mill so I can lose weight last year. I started using and I was going great. Then i lost my motivation and it all fell apart and the pounds came back . I'm using it again and I don't want to disappoint my family. Is anyone out there who I can relate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The guys a punk for hitting the lady and if I were marching I would dropped his ass and kicked him out of there since it's obvious he doesn't belong there . With that said I heard this woman is starting some sort of witch hunt for him . Call the cops yeah , press charges, But a calling people to find him is a bit too much. There has been way more violent attacks on journalists and a pouch in the face , while still fucked up, doesn't require to put a public bounty of the fools head . She needs better than him by being the bigger person .Its just my opinion, I don't want to start any shit. </TEXT>
