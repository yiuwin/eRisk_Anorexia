	<TEXT> Two things. Pro wrestling. Fell in love with it way before being a teenager and always told myself this was something I truly loved. 30 and still watch everything I can.

Pop punk music. Got into it as a teenager and haven't stopped. I listen to stuff from back then and stay current with new stuff as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was pretty fun, I actually really enjoyed the opening match between Patrick Clark and Oney Lorcan quite a lot. Clark hit an amazing clothesline stopping Lorcan's comeback and Lorcan shot into the air and took a flip bump off of it, landing on Clark. Looked really impressive.

Also, Shane Thorne is a total freak athlete as well and I'm excited to see those guys more on TV. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They wrapped the main event with Aries/Joe Vs. Nakamura/Jose early due to an injury to Aries. It looked like he got busted open after going for a roaring forearm and Nakamura caught him with a kick to the face. Was down on the mat for a few minutes while the doctors attended to him, but got up on his own and walked off with the medical staff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hand squeeze is an indication of being ok. If a wrestler can't apply pressure to your hand and squeeze it it could indicate numerous things after a big bump. If you have a stinger, if you're knocked unconscious or in the worst you're paralysed. You'll see the refs do it a lot of the time after a wrestler will take a bump on there neck. </TEXT>

I was hoping to be shocked by even a Brian Kendrick coming in for Smackdown. I hope they still have a few cool things planned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This nerdy girl in high school always had a crush on me, she ran in the same circle of friends but was always in the background or not around when I was around. She was kind of a non-entity to me.

Fast forward a few years later, I'm working at a movie theater and this gorgeous girl comes up to me and says hi. I legit have no fucking clue who this person is and I straight up ask who she is and she tells me. It's the nerdy girl of course. We exchange numbers. Date... The sex was pretty fucking bad.

She would dry up like almost instantly. And sure that might be because turns out she wasn't as into it as she thought she would be too. She broke up with me on the phone after a few months and I was just like yeah yeah no doubt I'll see ya around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what needs to be done. They need to treat it as a hard split and give the two brands a different look. Keep them separate for a couple of years so if they do need to have an inter-brand match it means a lot more.

Want to build a huge match between Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens again a year down the line and they are on separate brands? Have them cross paths at SummerSlam and get in a huge brawl and then keep them mostly apart until the Rumble and blow it off at Mania. </TEXT>
