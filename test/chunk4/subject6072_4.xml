	<TEXT> Maybe I'm alone on this, but forget the treaties.  They were ill-intentioned, racist agreements made in a different time.  If you put them up in a court of law, they don't even meet the legal requirements of a contract anyways.

Imo, the best way forward is to drop those dumb treaties and start treating them like regular Canadians for starters.  I think its time we stop bending to discriminatory agreements made in the late 1800's and start figuring out how we are going to solve this problem today, in 2017.

And frankly, I think that we as a country need to move past that dark chapter of our history and figure out instead what the best path forward is.  And it has become abundantly clear the best path forward is not through those treaties. </TEXT>

I think O'Leary says too much dumb shit, it'll make it easy to put him on the defensive.  Unless something goes very wrong and Canadians are aching for a change, I can't really see O'Leary being able to convince Canadians to take a chance on him.

	<TEXT> Agreed totally!  I remember thinking at the time it was genius.

Harper had basically placed all his eggs in the economy basket.  No one voted for his undeniable charm, or superb foreign affairs handling, and well, as far as social issues went he pretty much just ignored them unless he was forced into dealing with them.

Trudeau (or his campaign) figured out that all they had to do was convince Canadians the economy would be fine without him, and the rest would fall into place.

That's why the ad was so genius. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing to remember is equalization payments don't always go to the same people.  Alberta has been a 'have' province forever, but that could change soon.  Some places like Quebec are basically perennial 'have-not' though.  Equalization payments are meant to even out living standards across Canada, they are never designed to end.  They definetly are not designed to make provinces more self-sufficient.  They're only meant to even out living standards.

Personally I think they're a bad idea.  Reason being is they make the whole country less efficient imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I agree, but your drastically overstating the importance of the tax rates in this.  I actually don't think she should have raised it at that time, but it did not have much more than a small impact.

Jurisdictions lower and raise corporate tax rates by a percent or two all the time.  No company is going to move based on that.

Did it help the problem?  No, it did not.  But did it cause it?  Not even close.  The problem is Alberta has high-breakeven oil that simply isn't profitable at these oil prices.  You can cut the tax rate in half, it'll still do nothing more than marginally help the problem.

And many of them [did go bankrupt](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/abandoned-oil-wells-in-alberta-1.3613068) though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All those tax increases still left Alberta with average to below average tax rates though.  Still very competitive.  As of today, Saskatchewan and Alberta [have the same corporate tax rate](http://www.taxtips.ca/smallbusiness/corporatetax/corporate-tax-rates-2016.htm).  Alberta does not have sky-high taxes by any measure.  Alberta has a carbon tax that Saskatchewan will too soon, but has no PST.  

There were *many* other reasons for the investment reduction, the tax rates were very arguably not even the most important, or even close.  All investment in the oil sands has died since oil prices plummeted because it doesn't make sense anymore.  Corporations aren't fleeing because of perfectly average tax rates, you're simply the situation.  Most of them didn't leave at all, they shut down.  Alberta's rig count is 10% of what it was two years ago.  Can you find even one example of a major company moving since the tax rates increased?  I can't, noti that moved their HQ out.  Plenty of companies have sold oil sands assets, but thats a reflection of oil prices, not tax rates.  Oil sands assets suck at these oil prices.

Brad Wall hasn't pointed out anything.  He just implemented a whole host of tax increases, can he really be pointing to Alberta for anything about making themselves uncompetitive now?

If Saskatchewan was so awesome for energy companies, Wall wouldn't have to go around begging and subsidizing individual companies.  They would just show up.

EDIT: And I don't think [anyone will be going to Houston for a tax break](http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/outside-the-boardroom/article/Texas-ranks-among-worst-on-corporate-taxes-9451809.php). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Results: Poll About Canadian News Sources </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-31 01:08:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So we held a short poll to get some people's opinions about various news sources, and it seems like the results are in.  If anyone is still interested in taking the poll, it is [available here](http://www.polljunkie.com/poll/xjobep/canadian-news-sites-poll) and is still open (I'll update the results if more people do take it).  I'm not professional pollster or anything, so no one take these results too seriously or get mad at me in the comments.  

So people ranked each news source from most to least for each question.  The number in brackets after each answer was the average ranking of it.  Here are the results:

**Responses**: 20

**Q1: Which news source is the most unbiased?**
[1] CBC (2.9)
[2] Globe   Mail (3.1)
[3] MacLean's (4.5)
[4] Global News (4.8)
[5] iPolitics (5.2)
[6] National Post (5.3)
[7] Toronto Star (5.4)
[8] Huffington Post (6.4)
[9] Toronto Sun (7.5)

**Q2: Which news site has the highest quality analysis of issues?**
[1] Globe   Mail (1.9)
[2] CBC (2.0)
[3] MacLean's (3.5)
[4] iPolitics (4.2)
[5] National Post (4.8)
[6] Toronto Star (4.8)
[7] Global News (6.1)
[8] Huffington Post (6.1)
[9] Toronto Sun (6.8)

**Q3: Which news source has the highest quality fact-checking?**
[1] Globe   Mail (2.6)

	<TEXT> Theres a difference.  Obama got book sales from books he had already published, so has Trump but I'm not complaining about that.

Bill made millions speaking.  Fine, but he did it AFTER his Presidency.  Trump is welcome to do the same.

And in niether of those situations did they make money off of the government itself.

He's literally forcing government agencies to rent out space in his buildings.  Thats beyond wrong.  Its not the same as previous Presidents </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Relevant piece from the Wikipedia article:

"The settlement (and Resolute) was created by the Canadian government in 1953, partly to assert sovereignty in the High Arctic during the Cold War. Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak, Quebec (on the Ungava Peninsula) were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife.[9] They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada's claims to sovereignty in the area and the Inuit were forced to stay."

And he cited no plans for a carbon tax, because he can't wrap his head around the fact that its coming whether he likes it or not.  He's also offering individual subsidies.  

All I can find is he said he will reduce royalties and corporate tax rates, but I can't find anything on when or how much.  And hey, I normally stay out of this, but Walls the one going around trying to individually poach our businesses, and publicly at that.  Good luck to him, but I doubt he's going to find any success. </TEXT>

Saskatchewan's carbon tax is coming soon as others have pointed out.  And the sales tax that Alberta doesn't have also makes a difference.

	<TEXT> Most Conservative candidates basically advocate for no action.   Up to this point, few democratic countries have [done as little as Canada](https://germanwatch.org/en/CCPI) to fight climate change.

Look, I totally get being skeptical about what we're doing and how fast we're doing it.  But too many people, and too many Conservative leadership candidates, seem determined to do nothing.  As the 8th largest emitter in the world, I think we definetly have an obligation to do something.  

I would be fine with Conservatives arguing about practicality, but right now it seems they argue against any and all action, and act like if we do something, anything, our economy will shrivel up and die instantaneously. </TEXT>
