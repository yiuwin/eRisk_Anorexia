	<TITLE> First year student, is it normal that i hate my university to my gut ? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-13 17:48:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> TLDR version below, also please pardon my bad English


I have been studying in uni  (computer engineering field) for 6-7 months and i absolutely hate it. Don't get me wrong, i love what i am studying, ( never have that much fun in my love when i code my own game project ), it's just 90% of my classes are absolutely horrible. 


Teaching methods are dreadful. Teachers don't seem to care too much about their class. 50% of my classes are literally someone reading from a slide and write anwser on previous assignment. The other half aren't that much better either. A teacher taught a relatively advance topic ( pointer ) yesterday, and i counted so many "erm..", "umm..", "maybe i just..." By the he figure things out for himself we were just looking at each other laughing because no one can understand what he just said. How can teachers not care enough to prepare before class, that's just unforgivable. In math class one time, i didn't understand a concept so i decided to ask my teacher personally, got a straight up fuck you figure it out by yourself i already taught this in class. The only reason i didn't fail Calculus and Discrete Math was because of Khan Academy and google. 

This is also a problem of facility but since my uni doesn't require a lot of money, i can understand that.

I tried so hard on my univesity exam to get into this place and now I lost all my motivation to go to class, What's the point really, since it doesn't do me any good. I have been skipping classes a lot lately, it's irresponsible i know but still feel so right. Please, someone tell me if this is just a first year crisis, that i am just nit-picking and complaining too much. Or my uni really is shitty and i need to find a better one

TLDR: Hate university, class suck, teachers and university don't give a fuck about their teaching or student. Should i find a new university or am i just bitching too much

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am trying to create a glowing effect by changing the sprite's value and saturation, but i don't know how to change them in code. There's a color_get_value and color_get_saturation functions but said functions can only return the value, not change them

I tried using the color_get functions to create my own the color with make_color_hsv(), but it's too complicated for me and doesn't seem to work </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This might sounds clich but what helped me the most was exercise, lots and lots of exercising. Being in uni does help with that since most of my professors  are "kind" enough to leave assignments. 

But i think you can easily find those exercise online, just need to categorize your studying since they usually aim at a specific subject. Set up your own deadline and do 1 subject a week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  f you make an object for the crop item, you can make a stage variable attached to the object and set alarms for each growth period. e.g. in the Create event, set crop stage to 1, set alarm[1] to some time period. In alarm[1], set crop stage to 2, set alarm[2] to some time period. et cetera.

i did that but it doesn't seem to work. I created a "stage" variable for each instance, and an alarm event that + 1 to  "stage". set alarm to 30*10 (10s), but nothing seem to happen. I debugged the game to check and the variable doesn't change  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am making a fairly simple farming simulator, things like inventory or planting seeds are already set up. But i have no idea how to set timer for crops to grow. My idea was to set a "stage" variable. 

stage  =  0: land not yet planted with crops

stage = 1: first stage of crops. Up to 3, and at 3 i will be able to harvest.

I don't know how to make GMS continously check for the stage variable, and how to change it with a timer, please help </TEXT>
