	<TEXT> Recovery or continue self destructing and ultimately,potentially slowly killing myself.
Recovery means reaching my life goals,attending Law School,hopefully marrying a great guy,and maybe even starting a family.
Recovery is also very,very scary,and will be EXTREMELY difficult,damn near impossible.
So I've ultimately chosen to continue my addiction,and hope to eventually "grow out of it" rather than enter Treatment and kick some of these habits for good.
I KNOW it's a mistake,but I can't seem to find enough reasons to begin recovery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently 19,but I had the Mirena inserted when I was 17. 
I've never had children,my period was very irregular,and very mild and light when I did receive get it,and to be honest, I knew very,very little about IUDs before getting mine.
I was in a Treatment Facility for Anorexia when my Dr. was very forceful about me being put on some form of birth control,and although I had no prior knowledge of IUDs,I liked the idea of having a more long term form of birth control,that required very little follow up.
Insertion hurt,like a bitch. Possibly because I've never had children or even visited a Gyno before,but it was VERY painful. My doctor had difficulty getting my Cervix open,so possibly that added to the crazy amount of pain,but it was a painful few moments.
The rest of the day,I was sore,crampy,and just kinda laid on my side trying to deal.
The next month/month and a half I had spotting,but since then I have not gotten my period again. 
After the initial pain on the first day,I haven't had any pain,difficulty or discomfort or any annoyances from the IUD. 
To me,it was TOTALLY worth it. I didn't have pain meds(they weren't offered,and I'm usually personally opposed to pain meds unless totally mandatory) but honestly you probably don't need xanax or anything too hardcore. 

***Side Note*** I was on my period the day of insertion,and I was so embarrassed and apologetic,but my doctor actually said that insertion is often easier when you're menstruating. So fun fact!

	<TEXT> My older brother went from February of 2013-February 2014 and showered less than 5 times that whole year. He smells SO funky.
He is a hardcore alcoholic,and is usually really depressed,so he just lays in bed,eats,drinks and smokes. It's not a good life </TEXT>
