	<TEXT> That! And the amount of food that goes to waste on a nightly basis. 


I can't tell you how much food I had to throw away after my mom has these elaborate dinner parties, and we're left to clean the mess. Whole falfels, samoas, chunks of meat, cornish hens, plates of rice, salads, fruit...


Pisses me off to no end that she will make us throw away any food  that was on a person's plate, even if it wasn't even touched. They simply aren't allowed to become leftovers or saved or given away, just because it was on someone else's plate. And this is food that is just laying there on a plate, no one took a bite out of it!


Oh well, people just like to look at food on their plates these days, I guess.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello!

I don't know why your comment is so down voted, but I really do appreciate your advice and taking the time to write a thorough and thoughtful response. You seem like a very devout Muslim who's very passionate about the teachings.


You still have faith, although not as high as you would like for it to be but you still have it. It's a matter of keeping and guarding whatever is left of that faith that's important.


Yeah, dunno how much of it is left anymore, unfortunately. 


we shouldn't only attempt to please God


I agree with you on that one, but that seems to be the logic of a lot of people here. 


Their motivation seems to stem down to do whatever God says in order to just please him and go to heaven and reap all of the rewards there. 


If all people are doing is blindly following the rules because they're afraid of hell or because it is just "the way" it's been done, without questioning whether or not what they are doing is fundamentally right or wrong or even beneficial, then that's just sad and dangerous and can lead to a cult mentality.


Thankfully, Islam encourages questions and curiosity. Which is why I'm asking WHY it's forbidden for me, as a woman to marry a good Christian man who shares the same values as me.


And with believing in Him, you'd also practice what He ordains because He knows what's best for you.


Well, that kind of completely nullifies what you said before. I thought we weren't suppose to blindly follow just because, just because, just because...God said so. 


Do you honestly think you know better than Him?


No, but I believe He gave us all free will and a mind to make decisions for a reason. 


If He wanted us all to just simply obey and be perfect, then He would have shaped us in the form of angels.


God knows we are all sinners, as none of us are or ever will be perfect. And He has given us the choice to not only do what is right, but to figure out what is right in the first place.


I don't think humans were just put on this earth to hear and obey. That is the job of angels. And robots. 


A concern that I share is your statement: "I'd like to admit that I'm a massive sinner." I hope to make an excuse for you that you did not necessarily mean that in a positive manner.


Not at all. 


I just wanted to point out that I am aware of a lot of sins that I've committed and that I am not extremely pious or of strong unwavering imam. I am a sinner, and while I'm not proud of it, I don't want to come off as a hypocrite or someone who believes she is following Islam spotlessly. 


what kind of sins are we talking about? Why or what compelled you to do them? Why did you not guard against them? Do you understand the severity of the sins? Do you understand why they're sinful? And more importantly, do you feel proud or ashamed of them?


Uh, quite a few. Circumstances, ignorance and mostly impulsiveness. A lack of faith, so I didn't see how it was important to guard against them. I understand the apparent severity of the sins and the punishment that goes along with them. I understand why some of them are sinful. Some other ones, where I don't see how I'm hurting anyone while doing them, I don't really see how they're sinful. I certainly don't feel proud of the sins...


When you pray, do you realize the heaviness of Surah Al-Fatihah?


Since my faith isn't as strong as it should be, I will honestly admit that I don't find prayer to be very consoling or a very profound experience. 


A question I have for you is why do you think loving someone is a sin?


I suppose it's not really loving someone, as much as loving someone who's of a different faith that is a sin. 


I don't have anything concrete from the Qur'an about love being wrong, but it seems like a lot of others on this post are firm believers of that. Someone here even quoted something about love being a "deadly illness". A lot of Muslims seem to perpetuate this idea that love is evil, but you're right I should have researched that myself and found evidence in the Qur'an myself. 


If someone with whose piety and character you are satisfied comes to you, marry to him.


Sigh, I'd love to, if I could. 


He may have the same morals and values as yours but so do a million other men in this world, Muslim or not. What makes him more special than anyone else other than the fact that you simply know him? 


Other than the fact that I've formed a deep emotional connection for him, we are very harmonious and compatible with each other which I think will allow us to maintain a very strong and healthy marriage. We're both very fond of each other, love each other and genuinely care for each others' well being. We've made a really profound connection because of the time we've spent together and the memories we've formed.


I'm not sure you understand the seriousness of our attachment, love and overall relationship since you're asking why I believe he's anymore special than any of the other men on the planet. He's very different, because I actually *love* him. 


And what is with the strong dislike for Muslim men that we're getting from your post? Why are you limiting a large amount of Muslim men to indecency and elevating non-Muslim men to greatness? Did you have some rough experiences with them? If so, how did you end up experiencing them when you shouldn't have in the first place?


I apologize. 


I don't mean to come off as generalizing about the entire Muslim population of men, but almost every Muslim man I've interacted with so far has not given me a reason to think very highly of them.


 Mostly, they are hypocrites who condemn one person for sinning, while they are sinning themselves. For example, I've met many Muslim men who scoff at people who eat pork or who don't fast, but who drink, do drugs and have sex regularly. It's not my place to judge them of their sins, and that's not even what irritates me. It's the fact that they feel entitled to judge and gossip about other people (especially Muslim women) as if they are pure and have never sinned or as if them being male excuses a majority of their sins.


Again, it's not my place to judge anyone of their sins, and it's not right to generalize about people, so I apologize for that. 



your spouse should be the one who shares the same religion as yours. He should believe that God is One and that Muhammad is His messenger. He should be the one that obeys God's laws down to the letter and should never partner anyone with God. 


And why shouldn't yours have the same criteria? Just because you're a male??


Why you would want to marry someone who doesn't believe in your prophet is something you will need to ask yourself.


Because I truly love and care for him. Why would any Muslim man want to marry someone who doesn't believe "in their prophet". Why are they even allowed to if this main thing is so important??

A more critical point is about raising your family. Islam is huge on family and familial responsibilities. Men and women have their places in the household.


This has been mentioned many times before and is a very weak argument. 


If there was such a huge discrepancy between what values Christians and Muslims hold that influence the upbringing of their family, then wouldn't marriage between the two for women AND men be haram?

Men being able to marry out of their faith just dilutes the entire "different value system" argument, because if that was really the case then it would be haram for both men and women.


You have no guarantee that your Christian friend would protect and defend your faith or even raise your family from Islamic teachings. In Christianity, men assume headship and must raise their children as Christians.


I have no guarantee of any of that stuff even if I married a Muslim. I've known this man for more than a year and trust him with all my being. 
Today's Muslims aren't very orthodox about these things that you mentioned; 

fasting during certain days, sexual abstinence, alcohol, interest, insurance, pork, mixed company, gambling, music, dog ownership, and more.


So I don't think marrying a Muslim will guarantee me a way out of those problems. 


The reasons why the "modern world" views marrying at a young age as unacceptable are because the meaning and understanding of marriage changed and maturity delayed.


Actually, girls today are entering puberty at a much more earlier age than ever before. But that's not the point though. 


The point I was trying to make is that since the interpretation of that part of Islam has changed due to what is deemed acceptable in the modern day world (i.e. we know that having sex with children is wrong) why can't the interpretation of women not being able to marry outside of their faith because they have no so called influence over the upbringing of their children (which we know is not true in the modern day world) be changed a well. 


Islam outlines how spouses should be compatible and only from there can love genuinely flourish.


Great! Me and him are not only compatible, but genuinely love each other! We should be able to get married then. 


 For the most part, we can explain them and it makes perfect sense. In other times, we have to say, "God knows best."


I still don't think God meant for us to follow things blindly. Knowing the reason behind why things are the way they are strengthens our convictions in them. This is why I was losing my faith to begin with. Because I was never given a concrete answer that truly and logically answered my question of why.


I don't think it's wrong to question. And when we are lead to a dead end, or to a place where no one has an answer, then maybe it's time to re-evaluate what we're doing and if there is any benefit to continuing the practice. 


Anyways, thank you for your thoughtful response! It gave me a lot to think about! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  so it's not like we have total freedom.

Right, but you still have an unequal advantage compared to women. If I was a man, then I wouldn't even have this dilemma. Why?


how can you turn around and say something like "I think this is outdated"? How could something that you believe has been passed down from God for mankind for all time become outdated?


Question. Do you still believe the marriage of a young child, the age of what Aisha was when she was wed is still applicable to modern day life?


If you have a daughter, would you allow her to get married at 6 years old and then have sex at 9??


This is what I mean about outdated. Yes, that might have been okay back in the day when people were wed at a younger age, but it's very disturbing to think about in the modern world. 


Some things which were historically okay back then can't just can't be applied to life nowadays. 


Saying you'd rather go to hell just to spend time with someone in this lifetime is extremely foolish to put it bluntly and actually worried me a bit reading it.


Saying you're willing to just obey anything without question because an authority said so or because it was "passed down" for years worries me a lot. 


An eternity of unimaginable pain just to spend a few fleeting years on Earth doing whatever?


Not doing whatever. Getting married to the man I love. 

And yes, spending my life with him would be worth all the pain and suffering I'd have to endure in hell for doing just that, if that's what it comes down to. 

You can't see into your future and know what will happen by being with this man. You can't see what potential harm or problems it may cause.


Of course not. But that also means you can't see what potential positive consequences will come from the union of two kindred spirits who care very deeply for each other. No one can see into the future.

I think that you have allowed an infatuation with a man to cloud your judgement.


Not infatuated. Love and care for him, yes. Blindly infatuated implies I've lost all reason and rational. This is clearly not the case if I'm willing to ask and discuss this with people who have opposing viewpoints.


putting in that little bit of extra effort and finding a good Muslim man to be with


Why would I do that when I already have the man I love and want to be with the rest of my life?


Why is the Muslim man who I have no feelings for given the priority or treated as superior to the man I feel a deep connection with??

	<TEXT> If we were only made to obey God and sacrifice, then why wouldn't God just make us into angels, who's only apparent job is to worship and obey Him?


We're not zombies. God gave us freewill for a reason. So that we can choose between what's right and wrong for ourselves and deal with the consequences. God already knows that all of us are sinners and that none of us will ever be perfect or follow everything exactly. The choices are ours and at the end of the day, we're all sinners, some way or another.


If the only reason why you're following something is because of fear of hell or because of the rewards that will be awaiting you in heaven, and you're not questioning whether something is fundamentally right or wrong, then you're not really living. You're just following. 


Doing something because it is the way that it's been done forever, or because someone with authority told you to do it, without asking whether it is right or wrong, or if it is beneficial to anyone is a dangerous cult mentality. 


It's what normal German citizens once did long ago that encouraged the Nazi party, and what many corrupt governments, military and terrorist organizations adopt to in order to have normal, civil people do what they want. 


You do what your told because someone who has more authority than you told you to, or because of fear of punishment or because of promise of reward. 


You're not really considering whether it is right or wrong. 

Renew your connection with Allah



I'm afraid if I'm forced to severe my connection with the love of my life, my connection with the God that people are claiming *wanted* me to do so will never be the same. 


recommend ending this relationship as quickly as you can

Give me one good reason besides "God said so" or the lame "you have different believes therefore your children/household will magically be drawn to whatever the faith the father is".


It's not very easy to leave the person you want to spend the rest of your life with because of something as small as a religious title, when you don't even have a concrete reason as to WHY it's wrong in the first place. 


I encourage you to look at things in your life, and imagine having to leave your wife because of this. It's much easier said than done.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! Thank you for being understanding and trying to see things from my perspective! I truly respect that. 


I do believe that God has blessed us all with many things and that he must be wiser than his creations, since he created us all...

And I think one of the greatest things God has blessed us with is a brain and the ability to think and reason through situations. 


We were blessed with free will, and the ability to decipher between right and wrong. If he wanted our strict obedience, wouldn't he have shaped us like angels who just follow what they are told and are literal slaves of God? 


Islam strongly condones asking questions and figuring out for oneself how to do the right thing. To me, leaving the one I love for one simple reason (the title of his religion) would be more harmful to him and me, as well as both of our futures and would create resentment in our hearts for the rest of our lives toward the deity who forced us to be separated from each other.   

I just don't believe that a loving, merciful, God (which is what is described to us in the Qur'an) would want us to do things that hurt ourselves and each other without question. 


God knows we are all sinners, as none of us are or ever will be perfect. And he has given us the choice to not only do what is right, but to figure out what is right in the first place.

	<TEXT> Maybe they are already taken, or the love is one sides, or the love of their life has passed away. 


I kinda don't understand how my situation, where I can readily marry a good man that I love and who loves me, and who makes me into a better person, can compare to all those other situations you described.


An unrequited love or death of a loved one are obviously extreme circumstances which would not allow a person to even really think about getting married in the first place. So it's not very fair to compare that with our problem.


We're already at that point where we already *know* we're compatible and I'm ready and he's ready to get married, but we apparently can't according to this one Islamic law, which is our only obstacle.


I also don't understand how he will be harmful to me or my future children. Just like you and your wife, we're very harmonious together. We share the same values and morals. The only difference is that his title is a Christian, and mine is Muslim. 


Let's change the roles here. What if you were a Muslim man, and she was a Christian woman, and it wasn't allowed for you to marry her, simply because she was Christian. Would you give her up so easily, even though you feel this deep emotional attachment to her? Even though you love and care so much about her, and know how much of a good person she is, and realize how kindred your two spirits are. Would you just let her go for someone who satisfies the title of Muslim?


If there was such a huge discrepancy between what values Christians and Muslims hold, then wouldn't marriage between the two for women AND men be haram? 


Men being able to marry out of their faith just dilutes the entire "different value system" argument, because if that was really the case then it would be haram for both men and women. 

I think maybe your viewpoints on the roles of men and women are a bit outdated. Maybe back in the day, when men were the sole providers of the household, you could make the argument that they were meant to be the leaders of the family and that they have all of the responsibility of maintaining the household. 


Today, however, there are many women who work full time, and still play a huge role in rearing children. They are not only responsible for providing for the family, but also for instilling good values/raising kids. No matter what you believe, you can't deny that mothers hold a large influence in the upbringing of children and how a family functions. So why do you believe men have this huge responsibility in the household that women don't? 


Allah calls you to Islam (submission to Him alone) while a non-Muslim husband calls you to other than that.


That makes absolutely no sense to me...Can you explain? Does him being Christian imply that I will be forced to worship him or anyone else??

as a non-Muslim he won't be making his decisions according to Islam

You're right, WE will be making decisions TOGETHER. Because WE are equals, and we will be united in matrimony. Therefore, neither ONE of us will be making a decision alone according to one faith or the other. That is what equality is all about! 


Also, I'm not too worried even if he happened to make decisions  by himself according to his faith since there is really hardly any difference between our faiths and value systems that we share (remember Islam is based off of Judaism and Christianity!). 


Marriage to a non-Muslim when you are a sister is forbidden. That's why you stay away from getting too close and falling in love with someone you can't marry. 


If everything happens for a reason that God ordained, then he was put in my life for a reason. I didn't purposefully stay close to him and tell myself to fall in love with him so that I would desire to marry him and consequentially sin.



Be patient and you will find insha'Allah someone wonderful who meets all of your expectations and is Muslim. 



He already has.


Still don't understand the need for him to have the title of Muslim for me to marry him.


He's met every expectation I have for not only a man I'd like to marry, but for a soul I would like to spend the rest of my life with. If I were to marry someone else, I'd be committing zina of the heart because my love, soul and heart belong with him.

	<TEXT> Also, I realize that my post must have been deleted before some of you were able to read it, so here it is, in case anyone is interested. I guess this is what must have offended some of the people there and started the whole attack:


SubhanAllah, I'm at the lowest point in my faith and spiritually during the month of Ramadan, when your moral is supposed to be the strongest. I don't know what's wrong with me. Things just aren't making sense these days.

Even though I still do it, I don't see the point in fasting anymore. It feels like a punishment, and I've lost all the motivation I once had to do what God ordained was right. To be on His good side. I'm so apathetic. I don't even care if I make it to heaven anymore.

I'd like to admit that I'm a massive sinner.

I wasn't always like this. I used to loveeee following all of the rules and practices that are required of a Muslim. For a few recent years though, I've gotten myself into some terrible stuff that my parents would kill me for if they ever knew. But I simply don't seem to care, or don't see how it's even wrong anymore.

But the biggest reason why I'm losing my religion is my head just keeps circling around this idea. I'm a sinner for loving someone of a different religion? Really? Since when is loving someone even considered something terrible to do?? Why is it a sin in the first place???

He has the same morals, values and is a much more decent person than 75% of the "Muslim" men out there. Just because he doesn't call himself a Muslim, I can't be with him? Even though he's the kindest and truest man I ever met???

If Islam is based off of a lot of the same values of Judaism and Christianity, then we share the same basic value system, and I don't understand what the huge discrepancy is between marrying a modern day "Muslim" man (who are usually huge misogynistic hypocrites who confuse religion with their f-ed up culture) and a kind hearted Christian or Jew or any other decent man. And I don't understand why a man can marry whoever he wants but a woman HAS TO marry a Muslim man. I feel like this type of thinking is outdated and limits women and the potential spread of Islamic ideals around the western world.

Just like people are saying that the marriage of Aisha at the young age of 6 was seen as something acceptable for that time period, and that now, it's not acceptable for the modern day world, I think that women being forced to or limited to only marrying men who call themselves Muslim, while men can marry whoever is completely outdated.

During Taraweeh, I start crying in the middle of the prayers because It's the only thing my mind is able to think about. It's simply unfair. I hold so much resentment towards this philosophy. I can understand why most of everything else is deemed haram in Islam, but I just can't wrap my head around this.

I've heard arguments that it's because if a Muslim woman marries a non Muslim man and has kids, the kids will take after their father.

That is simply not true. Who do children spend most of their time with as infants and children and kids? Their mother is usually the caretaker and has ample time to teach them about Islam and instil Islamic values into their hearts. Also, growing up with the knowledge of two different kinds of religions will only strengthen an individuals conviction and desire to do what they believe is right. At the very least, the child will not be ignorant of anothers' religion, as they would have grown up knowing the differences and similarities of both of their parents' faiths.

I just don't know what to do to. I can't get over the idea that this is completely wrong. Women are not children. They should not be told who they can and cannot marry. Good people come from all different faiths, not just Islam.

If marrying a good, kind hearted Christian man who I actually love is wrong, then I don't wanna be right. If it's going to compromise my place in heaven, then let me go to hell.

	<TEXT> Hello /r/exmuslim!! 


I was linked here, and just wanted to say thank you for all the support and positivity I've been getting on that post!! 


I didn't realize I'd be attacked so much for simply asking for advice...Some of those people really know how to bring you down and make you feel like the most terrible person in the world for just asking a question...


It's funny though, that subreddit is supposedly /r/islam but they've actually turned me away from Islam moreso than before I posted that. 


So yeah, I appreciate your guys' positivity and encouragement! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're generalizing about a whole group of women based simply on them being Christian. Muslims and Christians and Jews share a lot of the same basic principles. There is no religion that is inherently evil or that promotes not being chaste. 


Also, it's hypocritical to think that a Christian woman wouldn't give up her right to custody of her children and upbringing them with Christian values, but that a Muslim women would. We're not any weaker. 


Using that logic, Muslim women would be better candidates for rearing Muslim children with a spouse that has a different faith than men are, because we wouldn't give up our right to custody to them if things get bad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Completely unfair how women have to limit themselves! 


There are so many good people in this world who just don't take on the title of Muslim. So it's just completely out of the question to marry them because of that small thing?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, my mistake. 


Muslim men can marry any Jew or Christian, Muslim women can only marry Muslim men. 


Still unfair and makes no sense. 
If I was a man attempting to marry my good Christian fiancee, I wouldn't be in this dilemma, and I just don't understand why that is. 


Growing up, I knew a lot of Muslim kids who grew up with a Muslim father and a Christian mother, and they ended up resenting their father who imposed certain traditions or practices on them without explaining why Muslims have those certain values.


I don't think retaining a Islamic household and upbringing good, Muslim children has much to do with which spouse is Muslim. It has more to do with how those values are instilled. Is the father an authoritative man who's forcing his daughter to wear the hijab even though they have no idea why, and why isn't their mother wearing it??


Nowadays women have as much say in how their household is run as men. They will have ample opportunity to influence the upbringing of their children's moral and value system. 


Just seems sad how people are so concerned with the title of the religion these days, when there are good and bad people of every faith. There is no guarantee that by simply marrying a person with the title of Muslim (man or woman) that they will be a decent, honorable person. Consequentially, writing off a Jewish woman as a "whore" simply because she is Jewish is just ignorant... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's exactly what I'm saying! 


There's nothing righteous about blindly following something because if you don't, you'll get punished or because tradition or someone with authority is telling you to do it. This is cult mentality, and I don't think Islam was meant to be interpreted in this way. 

Those are exactly some of the unsettling things that came up when I was learning about Islam that made me question why certain things just need to be followed just because. A lot of these ideas seem to be very outdated in this time and age.  </TEXT>

It's nice to see some reasonable encouragement throughout these comments. :) 


You're right, I think that's the point I think people are missing. We're all sinners and God judges! Not about to give up the love of my life, just because people believe it's a sin and can't even explain why it is a sin in the firs place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My fault, I thought people here would be more open. Well, some actually tried to give some helpful advice. 

The problem with talking to real people around me is that you never know what can slip up in conversation and make it's way back to bite you. For a religion that condemns gossip an backbiting, things sure get around quick in Islamic communities. 


And it's super dangerous if things get back to your parents, especially if you're a girl. Things can escalate pretty bad. Not to perpetuate the notion of stereotypically controlling parents who turn homicidal when it comes down to this type of stuff. But that is my reality as of now, and the reality of many other people. To be clear I blame the oppressive, backwards culture for most of this. I don't think Islam condones honor killings or whatever other violent things these parents think they have a right to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good point! 

That's what I'm struggling with. Why would God allow people to develop feelings for each other and then be like nope you can't marry them and punish them for it...Don't know why anyone would want to believe in this kind of a God. But this post made me realize that there are actual people who really believe in this, and believe it's the way of the world.

Just seems really sad when your religion leads you to believe that feeling such a wholesome, positive emotion like love will send you straight to hellfire.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! 

It's so strange how so many of these people believe in one God, one creator, one ruler, one judge and yet take it upon themselves to critic, judge and attack other people, like they feel a need to do God's job. According to Islam, everyone here is a sinner. Why do they believe my sins are worse than theirs or make me a worse person than them? Only God can judge people and their sins.


I know this isn't a very good reason, but I'm Muslim because I was raised with it. I'm sure you know, but it's extremely hard to forsake something you've known and were told was right all your life. 


It's ironic though, because the harsh, negative people who were attacking me just illustrated exactly what I do not want to become and are just pushing me to really re evaluate whether or not I want to continue being a part of a group with people who claim to believe in one God, but who act so judgmental and critical of their fellow brothers and sisters. They've really opened my eyes, as I'm not sure I want to follow this version of Islam anymore! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it began as a small cascade of events that eventually led me to stop being as consistent with things like prayers, and unwavering faith among other things.  


I was one of those good teens who did things because God said so, and I never questioned how beneficial they were to be doing them, or why we even did them. 

As I grew up, I started asking these questions and I never got any real, strong answers besides people just saying to do them because God said so and he knows best or because of hellfire or any rendition of that "logic". This just hurt the strength of my faith and made me more skeptical.

I still fast and pray taraweeh, mostly because I'm forced to. To me, it just feels hypocritical to just do these things during Ramadan. I still want to believe in God. I don't know, maybe it's my conscience and the strong upbringing of believing in God speaking, but I never wanted to completely turn my back away from God and deny the possibility that he exists. 


I'm just not sure about this angry, vindictive God who just wants people to suffer during their life to prove they're worthy of heaven that a lot of people are describing here...I thought God was forgiving, and loving and cared about his creations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, for anyone who was curious, this was my original post:




SubhanAllah, I'm at the lowest point in my faith and spiritually during the month of Ramadan, when your moral is supposed to be the strongest. I don't know what's wrong with me. Things just aren't making sense these days.

Even though I still do it, I don't see the point in fasting anymore. It feels like a punishment, and I've lost all the motivation I once had to do what God ordained was right. To be on His good side. I'm so apathetic. I don't even care if I make it to heaven anymore.

I'd like to admit that I'm a massive sinner.

I wasn't always like this. I used to loveeee following all of the rules and practices that are required of a Muslim. For a few recent years though, I've gotten myself into some terrible stuff that my parents would kill me for if they ever knew. But I simply don't seem to care, or don't see how it's even wrong anymore.

But the biggest reason why I'm losing my religion is my head just keeps circling around this idea. I'm a sinner for loving someone of a different religion? Really? Since when is loving someone even considered something terrible to do?? Why is it a sin in the first place???

He has the same morals, values and is a much more decent person than 75% of the "Muslim" men out there. Just because he doesn't call himself a Muslim, I can't be with him? Even though he's the kindest and truest man I ever met???

If Islam is based off of a lot of the same values of Judaism and Christianity, then we share the same basic value system, and I don't understand what the huge discrepancy is between marrying a modern day "Muslim" man (who are usually huge misogynistic hypocrites who confuse religion with their f-ed up culture) and a kind hearted Christian or Jew or any other decent man. And I don't understand why a man can marry whoever he wants but a woman HAS TO marry a Muslim man. I feel like this type of thinking is outdated and limits women and the potential spread of Islamic ideals around the western world.

Just like people are saying that the marriage of Aisha at the young age of 6 was seen as something acceptable for that time period, and that now, it's not acceptable for the modern day world, I think that women being forced to or limited to only marrying men who call themselves Muslim, while men can marry whoever is completely outdated.

I just don't know what to do to. I can't get over the idea that this is completely wrong. Women are not children. They should not be told who they can and cannot marry. Good people come from all different faiths, not just Islam.

If marrying a good, kind hearted Christian man who I actually love is wrong, then I don't wanna be right. If it's going to compromise my place in heaven, then let me go to hell.
