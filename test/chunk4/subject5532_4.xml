	<TITLE> Thinking of putting together an fanmade album of the AM tour. What should be included? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-21 12:41:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In a similar style to the fanmade albums high green sheffield and fools on parade. 

We're looking for the best performances of the main songs of the tour. What should I include?

Also, thinking something along the lines of "Early Morning Music: Artic Monkeys Live, The AM Tour" for the title? Music of the Morning? Early Hours? Before Sunrise: the AM tour? I know that's not what "AM" stands for, but I feel that fits the tone of the album well.

Some suggestions:

One for the Road - Sydney Entertainment Centre

Knee Socks - Austin City Limits

Snap Out of it - Album de la Semaine

505 - Glastonbury 2013

Knee Socks/My Propellor - Rock Wertcher

Fluorescent Adolescent - Sydney Entertainment Centre

He just finds the whole things hilarious and he's OBVIOUSLY sick of playing Dancefloor anyway, so he just mixes it up and fucks around with the lyrics, even teasing Jamie by going over and playing in front of him... and then he started doing the ridiculous crowd-hand-summoning things...

Also - does anyone know whether Alex just stuck to his normal part during Dancefloor when Jamie's guitar wasn't working? or did he try and cover areas of Jamie's part that were necessary?  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-04-11 10:11:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For me, the latter issues of this arc surrounding the problem of being on the road, running out of food, finding Tyreese etc. are much better than when they get to Hershel's farm.

Much with like I said with Shane in volumes 1-6, I feel both the "walkers in the barn" situation and Maggie and Glenn getting together are severely underdeveloped. The show just built everything up so that the walkers in the barn actually felt much more impactful when they came out. I also found it weird that Maggie and Glenn all of a sudden just loved each and Glenn was willing to leave the group when they depart from the farm.

Laters arcs in the series, such as the [](/c "Alexandria safe zone arc, with Rick gradually taking over leadership") feel way more developed.

Also - Donna's death :D </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I figured it would be cool to discuss the comics as a community, rereading and discussing as we go. Naturally I think we could be discussing events in relation to stuff that comes after (eg a thread on issues 1-6 might still have spoilers for issue 100) but we should certainly put spoiler tags on (cause although I'm almost up to date, I still haven't read the All Out War arc, a situation that other would be in, perhaps at different areas though). Spoilers from the issues we are discussing don't have to be spoiler tagged. 

Some general notes:

Naturally this was Moore's short stint with the artwork. Although, I do like the detail that is presented, I don't think the style is right. It is cool, but the grim and gritty style that Adlard presents from issue 7 onwards suits the feel much better. Although I must admit I agree with those that say the artwork has gone downhill.

Another thing I love about these issues is they stand really well on their own. They set up the story well, a lot of shit happens and they have an artwork style that is different to the rest of the series. I just really like this arc as whole.

I do feel that the Shane arc was really underdeveloped however. I like it much better in the show as it was really fleshed out and built up over a long time, whereas here I feel the audience barely gets to know Shane before Carl shoots him...

I thinking creating these discussions every 4 days would be appropriate, or maybe a week? Each discussion would focus on the next 6 issues.
Thoughts?

	<TEXT> The parts where you sing in higher regions sound better than than parts in the lower regions, which is probably just due to the key you're playing in being ill-fitted for your register. Perhaps move the chord progression up a few keys, as when you singer higher your voice is quite good.

Example of low region: "I thought I saw you in the battleship"

Example of high region: "she was close, close enough to be your ghost"

	<TEXT> Despair in the Departure Lounge is about having to break a relationship off as you're moving somewhere else

Do I Wanna Know is the singer asking himself if he wants to get romantically involved with a woman

From the Ritz to the Rubble is about trying to get into a nightclub and how the city looks different the morning after

Dancing Shoes is about not having the nerves to talk to women in a nightclub, even though it's the only reason you came

A Certain Romance is about English chav culture

When the Sun Goes Down is about a prostitute and a "scummy man" (a pimp)

Riot Van explains itself

Cornerstone is about a girl who a man loved. The girl is dead but the man searches for her everywhere, and sees her in every new girl he meets.

Arabella is about one hell of a sexy girl

	<TEXT> It depends what you find easiest to get into. I've come around to all their albums eventually, but I had to use the others as stepping stones. Here's my guide:

Whatever people say I am, that's what I'm not:
-True rock sound
-Very raw
-Catchy with some good "story" tracks such as Mardy Bum, When the Sun Goes Down and Riot Van

Favourite Worst Nightmare
-Similar to their first, maybe a bit darker though
-Highlight tracks: Fluorescent Adolescent, Balaclava, Brianstorm

Humbug
-Hardest to get into for me, very different to the previous two
-Very psychedelic rock
-Highlight tracks: Crying Lightning, Cornerstone, Pretty Visitors, My Propellor 

Suck It and See
-I like to describe the feel of this album as "Electric" 
-Some great lyrical songs
-Highlight tracks include: Suck It and See, Black Treacle, Don't Sit Down Cause I've Moved Your Chair, Reckless Serenade

AM
-Easiest to get into as it has broad appeal
-More pop, whilst still containing that Arctic Monkeys feel under the pop facade
