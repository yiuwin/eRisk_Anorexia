	<TEXT> Is there an out-of-universe reason why TNG started with very little emphasis on engineering? Were they trying to focus solely on the bridge crew? Were they trying to save money by minimizing the number of necessary sets? Italways seemed silly to me that there was no significant engineer cast member in that first season.

	<TEXT> When you are teaching pottery you have to be hyper aware that everything will sound super suggestive. I once told a class of first year art college students "always be touching yourself" while trying to explain that while using the pottery wheel it is crucial to have your hands in constant contact with each other for stability. Things like this happen to me on the reg and I've learned to acknowledge that I've said something hilarious, laugh it off, and humorously warn the class that it probably won't be the last time clay makes a teacher say something stupid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> isn't anyone going to mention that it's pretty irresponsible to goad and taunt his friend into jumping out of a moving car? as a new driver you may not yet realize that there are going to be plenty of times when you are going to have to be more grown up than other people around you, whether they are your passengers or other (bad) drivers. it's easy to say "it wasn't my fault" but as a driver you are absolutely responsible for the safety of those in and around your automobile. while your friend was being a dick it was your job to be the more mature one in this situation. cars aren't toys and if your friend had been seriously injured (which could have easily happened) you'd be answering a lot of very difficult questions right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the remote northern canadian village where I grew up the local corner store had games for rent, including a single copy of the japanese version of smb3. This was long before the english version was published in north america, and, i if i remember correctly, even before smb2 was available in our area. kids in our town were crazy for this game. if you wanted to be a someone you had to rent this game and have all your friends over to play it. which was not easy to do, because everyone else was also trying to rent it for their own gaming party. you had to book this cartridge weeks in advance, and hope/pray that whoever rented it the night before brought it back in time. i never thought much about it at the time, other than it was a bit of an oddity. but now, looking back on it, i gotta wonder where that cartridge came from. certainly no one in my town had ever been to japan. and the old couple who ran the shop - did they comprehend this gold that they'd somehow gotten their hands on? they probably made a fortune from this one cartridge alone, but did they have any idea what it meant to all of us? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Solar System as a whole is very suspicious. First there's that sun and moon thing you mention. Then Venus is just sliiightly too small to make out as a crescent shape when it's closest to earth. Jupiter is just sliiiightly too small to be seen as a disc. Saturn is just sliiightly too small to be seen as oblong (due to its rings). Jupiter's moons should be visible to us, but they're just sliiightly too close to Jupiter for us to see.

The solar system is a messy place full of random weirdness, but the way our eyes render it makes it appear rather mundane. Two almost identical discs and five almost identical point-like things. It's an astronomical coincidence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you said:
 he's not the best at anything

but he's objectively the best of his generation (the best by far) at goals+assists per games played, which most people believe to be a very important statistic and metric of excellence.

	<TEXT> yes, after reading OPs post my first thought was that perhaps high powered transmissions move faster than low powered ones. that might explain why sometimes messages take weeks to reach distant locations while at other times distant conversations happen in real time. in practice higher priority messages could be allocated more resources and hence reach their destinations quicker. in emergency situations damaged vessels sending distress beacons might have less power to dedicate to communication meaning said communication would travel slower and presumably be weaker. </TEXT>
