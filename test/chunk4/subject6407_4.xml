	<TEXT> I try doing it only in times of stress when under crunch time (like during tests). Outside of that I'm not to big on practicing it as much, but I've noticed I still managed to be more productive after this whole time slowing technique became more and more frequent, it always have a positive effect if you know how to use your time wisely! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is more of a short-term method of slowing time, but I read a book a few months ago titled the motivation manifesto. It has a chapter outlining how to slow the essence of time. The biggest highlight is to be aware of all senses at all times. Trying to conceptualize and focus on what's going around you will make it seem like more is going on by heightening our senses, therefore a certain period of time will almost feel like it is quantitively expanding. As we tend to drag on through the day, we will involuntarily lose focus on our surroundings and sensory awareness. This is why time dilation (or slowing down of time) happens when we are encountering activities involving reflexes or near death experiences. Our brain will tend to sort out the details that will be essential for avoiding any dangers in times of fight or flight. So one way to always start off the phenomena of time dilation is to breathe slowly and take deeper breaths, and then you should try to take note of what's going on **right now**. Ideologically, the next route will be trying to make this a habit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never, unfortunately.

Due to the highly unique properties that make Earth a planet (rich in Oxygen, dense ecosystems, fair amounts of water, etc...) its standards as a planet are relatively high to any astronomical bodies outside of its solar system. It is known for putting any other similar planet in the friendzone. AstroPsychics like myself, believe this is because Earth was once hurt after having a fight with her abusive meteor boyfriend billions of years ago, thus creating the moon.

	<TEXT> I'm not a mathematician, but I am doing research in college for it.  What I can grasp so far about mathematics is that there still are many mysteries about math along with unanswered questions that need to be solved to this day. It's mostly theoretical stuff that sum up a bigger picture on how math works (Riemann Hypothesis, Transcendentalism in irrational numbers, Hilbert's Problems, etc...). On top of that, math is a complex subject that isn't simplified completely, there are many ways that math could be the answers to many questions in other sciences as well as a tool to improve science, but mathematicians still are working at it to this day to find more correlation between math and the tangible world.
