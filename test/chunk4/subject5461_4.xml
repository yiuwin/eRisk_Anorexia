	<TEXT> I was playing a quickplay show a few days ago and took a break in-between songs, leaving the game and drums still on. When I came back, no buttons or pads would register as input. I shut down the PS4 and the drums could be used to turn the system on, but after that I couldn't use them for anything, not even turning it off again with the PS button. I've had them for about a year now with very few issues, but since that day I haven't been able to use my drums and it's bringing me down :( Has anyone heard of a problem like this, or is it time to bite the bullet and get new drums? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is technically nudity but I include it because that wasn't the bad part. A few years ago I went to what was advertised as a performance art piece, which isn't normally my thing but I thought I'd try something new. Drove for three hours to see... a blank canvas lying on the ground in a cordoned section outside the museum holding the exhibit. Then this guy walks out with an unusual gait, straddles the canvas, drops trou in front of the entire crowd, and craps out the brightly-colored paintballs he had stuffed in his butt before the "show". The end result was... I guess imagine Jackson Pollock by way of a nightmarishly distended anus, but god damn I was pissed. Seriously, I understand that modern art is about adjusting your expectations to live in a new world that embraces progressive thought, but I still reserve the right to feel ripped off when somebody can literally shit on a canvas and call it art. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a relatively simple UI tool that lets you pre-arrange a build and swap it out with whatever you're using. Say you're a speedfarming Whirlwind Barb and your buddy asks you to switch to a zDPS for a GR push. Would you rather meticulously swap each piece of gear, extract your gems, re-insert them, change up your Cube slots, swap out skills and runes, and double-check all of it to make sure you didn't forget anything... or just click one button that does all that automatically? Of course you have to have already farmed the items, but since alternate builds of gear would have been in your stash anyway, all it does is save you some time and uncertainty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I were a Blizzcon bookie, I'd wager a 5% chance of D4, 35% for a D3 expansion, and 60% for news on a series of game-balancing patches.

Furthermore, if D3X2 is confirmed, I give probably 85% that it consists of Act VI that takes place in Skovos. Very small odds for the introduction of a new class (let's say 20% tops), but fair odds (~55%) for the inclusion of some sort of fast build-swapping feature (for example, an armor rack on which you can pre-equip your gear and swap it for your current gear in town), although that's probably just wishful thinking on my part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry if this isn't the right place for this, but it was hard to think of how to phrase the question for Google so I came here instead.

So the Uliana's 4-piece bonus says "Seven-Sided Strike deals its full damage with each strike", which is another way of saying the damage is septupled. My roommate keeps insisting it's a 700% increase, but that doesn't sound right to me because a 100% increase (like from the Bastions of Will) is double, so scaling that would make it a 600% increase, right? Wrong? I bet the tab for dinner on him being wrong, so who's buying? </TEXT>
