	<TEXT> I sometimes feel that we'd have more Rakudai anime if it had aired in a different season to Asterisk.

I agree, it would've fared far better.

However, after Digibro's Asterisk War series, people realised that Rakudai was actually a good show and it's rating on animelist increased. </TEXT>

I love Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry unabashedly and realised very quickly the vast difference in quality.

I think people ignored Rakudai because of the incredible similarities between the two shows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> gone was the vulnerable rookie Superman that we all loved in MoS.

The end of MoS with the "welcome to the planet" ending, had already given us the beginning of the quintessential Superman. 

Such a perfect end to the first chapter of his story.

I still wonder to this day, why Snyder decided to focus on the African incident, instead of the BZ Event...which was a far more engaging topic post 9/11.

MoS is like the gifted elder child of the DCEU, BvS is the angry and rude middle brother.....the family don't like talking about SS. 

SS likes bellydancing, abusive relationships and chicken. XD

	<TEXT> so because someone is excited,he/she has the right to pester the Director?Hell,someone made a t-shirt with the caption "release the Justice League trailer'.

How is wearing a T-shirt pestering?

I remember the photo, the guy asked for a picture with Snyder politely.....how is that pestering?

Is he being stalked?

Has his office in the WB lot been broken into?

Pushing a camera in front of somebody who just got out of a flight is pestering......easily ignorable social media posts from fans is **engagement**.

Fucking yes but constantly harassing the dude when he doesn't have the final say is stupid to say the least

He may not have the final say, but he can communicate with the fans.

Saying that the trailer is close, and then 3 months passing is torture for fans. 

Snyder is such a tease, which is where the fan frenzy originates from.

For example, he posted the Aquaman footage for no discernible reason. Fans took that as a sign that the trailer was close.....why do that if you were not expecting any interest/hype? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> does that 'voice' include pestering the director several times asking for the trailer?

They're pestering the director because they're excited.

Also, it was Snyder who decided to use Vero and post content for fans.

Zack's friend co-founded Vero....and because of that - DCEU fans have made the social media app a lot more popular.

People hate TMZ when they're famous, but realise the importance of paparazzi when they're burnt out and forgotten. Clay Enos and co have every right to complain, but once the fans stop caring.....they will crave the attention yet again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that Snyder advances the cinematic language but he needs some help with the pacing and story aspects.

I think MoS is close to being a masterpiece. 

However, the third act is so action heavy that it becomes overbearing, then there are the issues with the script and the kissing atop vaporised human ash.

After Terrio signed on for BvS, I thought this would be the final nudge Snyder needed to make an amazing movie. He was already an amazing visual director, but had a few kinks that needed mending. 

Which is why BvS is the most disappointed I've ever been with a movie in my life.

Hopefully, JL will be a great movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm one of the few people here that doesn't want a trailer anytime soon. However, I disagree with Clay Enos's remarks.

There is no such thing as fans being "fucking spoiled", WB and Enos are lucky that they work on a project that is loved enough by people for them to actively seek it out. 

I've seen fans here thank WB for making DCEU movies, grateful for anything they release.

The reailty is, movie making is based on fan/audience equity. Your movie will be successful when the general audience decides to show up. Therefore, it's the studio who should be thankful.

Clay Enos should be thanking fans for their passion and dedication. Most of them have done nothing wrong, as long as it doesn't hurt anybody.....I say go wild.

I think someone spoiled a major part of JL for me.

I doubt it...other than the set visit - nothing much has been released. Even r/DCEUleaks is bare.

Even people on THIS sub breaking down things that have potentially given away HUGE MOMENTS.

Are you serious, you're blaming fans for uncovering something in a trailer the studio put out?

During the 90's, comic book fans would devour any movie comic book related and thank the studio for making them.....no matter how bad. Now, we are at an advantage.....we have the voice.

	<TEXT> Snyder has always had a problem with creating a concise story. It's no surprise that movies like Watchmen and 300 are considered his best movies.

Watchmen followed the source material religiously and 300 was based on an extremely simple premise. 

The simplicity is what's needed in JL.

I hope Snyder learns from his mistakes and focuses more on the characters, rather than a convoluted story. Afterall, Justice League will be an introduction to three of it's main heroes.

Sadly, I said the exact same thing before the release of BvS, so I guess we'll wait and see.

It's a cinematic universe that ties multiple movies together.

My example is one of multiple pre credit scenes that could've been hypothetically used in MoS.

They had a certain vision in mind for the character and they found the man who could portray that.

How would the scene I proposed affect Eisenberg and BvS?

It's literally a shot of a random person looking at the destroyed Lexcorp building. It could be Luthor or it could be a bystander... </TEXT>

Imagine if the final scene of MoS was  the back of a man looking at a destroyed building.....only to see the Lexcorp logo on the floor.

It would allow them to establish Luthor as the villain for the next movie **and** give them time to find an actor to play him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As Max Landis put it, (paraphrasing) "the equivalent of ten 9/11's".

I'm sad they didn't use the amazing story lines in the prequel comics.

In Lois Lane's comic, large corporations were stealing Kryptonian parts and selling them on the Dark Web. Criminals started using these parts to develop dangerous weapons.

Bruce Wayne noticed this and made it his job to get official access to as much Kryptonian tech as possible and analyse them at Wayne Tech.

There's also Zod's armour left on the roof of the building, which could've been a great explanation for the durability of Batman's armoured suit. 

All BvS needed to do was to focus on Batman, Superman and the BZ Event - the African incident and even Lex Luthor were unnecessary. </TEXT>

The BZ Event was an earth changing event, but BvS completely ignored it's repercussions world wide. I'm still confused as to how Superman has a statue after only two years.

It would take more than two years for people to trust Superman as a hero.

Before I saw the movie, I thought the statue would be unveiled *after* his death. </TEXT>

You could fly high enough to avoid prying eyes but low enough so you don't choke. 

The speed would be pretty low, but you can commute to work without traffic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speed as this is the most useful power in our world as fighting criminals isn't a option and flying... I would probably die as my body isn't for it

I think stamina is a better ability than speed. 

With speed, you could break your bones quite easily if you don't control how fast you run.

With stamina, you can run all day long, making it practical in the real world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it is sad how psychologically damaged she must be. I guess the mind can do strange things to deal with trauma.

When I saw the story, it reminded me of the relationship between Harley Quinn and the Joker. Never thought I would see a relationship like that in real life.

I wish I could say it was different or that this was a unique example but, frankly, when there is money to be made there will be journalism like this.

I haven't watched ACA for a long time, but in my memory - they were a lot better than that. I sincerely admired Tracy back in the day.

I guess with the current political climate, this method of reporting would garner more views.

They could have had on politicians and law enforcement and held their feet the fire and ask how services which help victims are being funded or what special training police officers receive to help people who report assault.

I agree, sexual assault and domestic violence are still big issues in our country. It would've been interesting to see them discussing those side of things. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Did anybody see ACA's exclusive story about the Skaf gang rapes today? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-06 09:54:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, just about twenty minutes ago, *A Current Affair* on Channel 9 - aired a story about the Skaf Gang rapes in Sydney.

The Sydney Gang rapes were one of the most heinous crimes in Australian history. Fourteen Lebanese youth led by Bilal Skaf - raped multiple women during the Olympics in 2000.

Both Bilal Skaf and his brother are both in jail.

The ACA however, were more focused on the woman who married these disgusting men. Joanne Senior, an ex criminal psychologist had secret affairs with both Skaf rapists.....and married one of them.

She even converted to Islam and bore his kids.

While this women is indeed deplorable, what scares me most is just how Channel 9 presented the story.

I didn't notice it at first, but it became more obvious as it went on.

I have to preface first, I'm a muslim. 

I was young when the rapes happened, but my parents and relatives have told me of the national sentiment towards Islam and Muslims during the trial.


By only focusing on Joanne's niqab as she ran away from the reporter, ACA was connecting the religion with the rapes to their viewers.

Furthermore, a random muslim woman began to help this monster into a car. 

When asked if she knew her......the woman said no....

I don't know if I'm sensitive post Trump, but I understood that small altercation as ACA putting forth the idea that muslims accept their own no matter what....even the most vile criminals.

The icing on the cake was when the story finished, and it was followed by a Pauline Hanson interview.

The interview was something to behold, it was a propaganda piece if I had ever seen one. She was crying and emotional as she met with her family and discussed Australia, Muslims and the Senate with Tracy Grimshaw in the beautiful outback.

Pauline Hanson: *"I want the good old Australia back"*

I haven't watched Australian TV for a very long time, so this really caught my eye.

To ACA, would it kill you to show real Australian muslims who abhor these men and their crimes...it's not that hard. 

Perhaps a sheikh/community leader and his/her reactions in 2000 when he heard about it. Or perhaps a look into how the Sydney Lebanese community sees these rapists.

Isn't showing both sides of the story the job of a journalist?

I apologise for the long post.

Did any of you manage to catch it on TV?

What did you all think?

	<TEXT> Take your personal projections to bed with you then. Make your points clearer, and try to refrain from sounding like a dissatisfied child when addressing these things.

Look, the warehouse scene is cool.

You see Batman use gadgets, every fan's dream right?

However, Batman using his **non lethal** gadgets in a tactical manner, showing his two dozen year experience would've been great.

Yes, he disarmed the guns, but decided to fight them head on anyway.

Why not kill the lights and do it stealthily?

Yes, he used his Batarang to kill a man (I believe it hit him in the chest), why not hit his leg and take the henchman out of the fight without killing him?

Yes, he used the Bat claw to squash a man's head on the concrete with a crate and spear another man.

Why not use the claw to confuse the henchman and attack them from different places?

Batman seems like an angry amatuer...rather than an angry veteran.

An angry veteran doesn't give himself unnecessary work.

"I'm too old for this shit"

He would avoid the henchman and find a way to save Martha without wasting time or advertising his location.

Hell, Alfred using the Bat-plane and the infrared could use a winch and grab KG Beast from the window.

	<TEXT> His armour remained well intact and unbroken as shown in the film. The only damage it took was the left half of the armoured cowl being ripped off, but it served Bruce well in its purpose of defending him from Superman. Clark can easily see it had protected Bruce from his attacks.

Batman's armour being strong enough to protect him is not the issue.

He's Batman, he could do anything.

The problem is, why is Superman fighting with a human like he did with Zod.

His mum is in danger, Batman no longer has counter measures.....it was the perfect point for Superman to talk and explain his situation.

Instead he threw him again to the right and through a building like he was fighting Zod.

Also, do you not see just how inconsistent the armour is.

It's undamaged when Bruce gets pushed three times, gets thrown in a building at full force and then thrown like a rag doll on the Bat signal.....but it gets damaged with a running punch Superman attempts while under the influence of Kryptonite.

Does that make sense to you?

I wish I didn't notice these things, but I think internal logic is important when creating the universe of the character/s </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which is shattered when he is led to believe that Superman caused the Capitol explosion

Wrong.

The news he was watching even confirmed that the bomber was not Superman and that it was in fact Wallace.

The letters Luthor conjured up didn't work.

They were supposed to come to Bruce regularly, but his staff decided not to give it to him. It was his first time seeing the letters. Further reinforcing that Wallace's anger and frustration finally resulted in him bombing the Capitol building.

No one cares about what you wanted, especially as you're using your own personal projections as a means to defend your ill-worded comments. Any credibility in your answers are gone by this point.

You said it was boring to see the fight in the trailer, only for it to end in a few seconds.

However, I only care about internal logic.

The Batman warehouse scene didn't make sense, It has nothing to do with what "I want".

You're blind as a bat. He uses his weapons disruptors to disarm the men right at the start of the fight, his Batclaw to grab one of the men towards him and send him flying backwards, his Batarangs to attack the gunmen shooting at him... is your brain permanently switched off when watching films? Or are you so eager to pick faults that you overlook what's right in front of you?

I apologise, I must be sleepy.

Let me reiterate.

**Batman didn't use his gadgets in an intelligent way to save Martha.**

Yes, he used the gadgets to fight.....but none of his gadgets were used to save Martha.

He decided to save her by aiming a gun at a man with a flame thrower...and then proceeding to shoot.

You might feel differently, but I didn't want Batman to use gadgets for the sole purpose of fighting...but to use his brain and come up with smart tactical ways to take them down.

	<TEXT> Before I respond, I just want to say that I will not belittle you for having a differing opinion to me. This is all civil and I think we can have a good natured conversation without judging each other or anything. (Looking at all the nasty people in the comments rn).

Thank you.

So, he was judging Superman preemptively. He knew there was a difference between the criminals he kills and Superman. But he began to blend them together in his emotional trauma.

I honestly side with Batman on his worries. 

Superman was raised human, so he has the powers of an alien and the emotional capacity of a human.

We saw just how easily he could be triggered in MoS, a rude customer throwing beer on him resulted in the man's truck/livelihood being skewered.

What if a warlord had kidnapped Martha and told him that he needed to attack an important landmark to save her...would he do it?

I don't know.....and that's a scary thought.

Criminals might kill people, but it's nothing compared to a man whose split decision could cause the death of a hindered people easy.

But Batman only kills those who are already trying to kill him.

What about the car he T-boned into an office? Were they trying to kill him?



The reality is, Batman didn't even need to engage them. He already shot a tracker on the truck, he could've easily waited until it reached the warehouse and just steal it. Instead, his actions caused numerous deaths and millions of dollars in public and private property....including a civilian truck, a few boats, a few warehouses etc.

why were they showering bullets at the very sight of Batman?

Yes they did.

They're mercenaries paid to protect a special cargo....if they see an intruder they're going to shoot.

However, no bullet dented the Bat-mobile, even the machine gun rounds bounced off it. He's in no real danger, meaning he didn't even have to engage.

He didn't have much reason to judge Superman the way he did.

This is my opinion of course, but the BZ event scene was masterful, as after that scene....I felt the same rage as Bruce.

So for me, I understand why he's fighting Superman. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That he'd spent the last 18 months wrongfully trying to hurt someone who was just as good as he was, if not even better as a person. He was ASHAMED of himself, as evidenced by throwing away the spear in his realisation

So let's get this straight.

Superman has been saving people for two years.

A statue was made to honour Superman for his bravery.

When the Capitol Hill was bombed, it was known that Superman was not the culprit...but cameras shows him trying to save people.

I will repeat this again for you because it seems you don't understand;

**Batman knows Superman is a good person**

Batman's entire thought process is simple. No matter how good this alien is, his unlimited power will spell destruction.

It may be tomorrow, next year or even ten years from now....but there will be a day when Superman hurts people by mistake or on purpose.

*Count the dead: thousands of people. Whats next? Millions? He has the power to wipe out the entire human race, and if we believe theres even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.*

Bruce's way of thinking is similar to Dick Cheney's One Percent Doctrine.

*If theres a 1% chance that Pakistani scientists are helping al-Qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon, we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response.*

This way of thinking doesn't care whether the person is good or not, but whether even one percent of error is worth the risk when the consequences are so dire.

The fact that you overlook the most obvious of details is painfully obvious in your commentary.

I would understand shame in a Batman who doesn't kill but has been teetering on the edge. Then, his intention to kill Superman is far more important. 

Will he break his rule to kill a dangerous alien?

However, that tension is not there....because we know Batman can kill indiscriminately.

You don't think Batman is clever enough to create a heat-resistant cape? Or bullet-proof, at the very least?

Why put her in that situation in the first place?

 I'm for debating things in a civilised manner

While you do debate well, I have seen your comments on here and I do see you as rude and condescending.

but frankly, you've grown so petty to the point that it's no wonder the majority of your posts are heavily down-voted on here. It isn't to do with having a different opinion

It's exactly because of my different opinions.

I saw this exact picture three times in the last month, and each time it racks up upvotes.

A post discusses some criticism a OP has....downvoted.

It's the reality of the sub.

Except his attention was focused on the sound of Batman attacking his men and trying to think of a back up plan, as his facial cues dictate.

He needed three minutes to come up with a plan? Really?

1 - Call Luthor

2 - Kill Martha

3 - Get out while your goons are distracting Batman.

4 - Drive away.

He sends his men one by one but they all get their asses handed to them. He knows the Batman is coming for him and his inability to react responsively is due to his fear.

KG Beast has shown us that he's a professional brutal enough to kill and burn their bodies. Luthor told him to hide Martha and to kill her if Superman tries to save her.

Now, how does he know it isn't Superman who's engaging his soldiers?

The reality is, Martha had plot armour.

Perhaps the only semblance of logic you show in your words, but just imagine how anticlimactic that would have been. You see Batman defeating all these thugs in the third trailer and then it turns out that he had finished his job in two seconds.

There were a million and one way they could've made the fight interesting. Furthermore, they showed the warehouse fight and didn't show us the actual theft of the kryptonite....the whole point of the first half of the movie.

I wanted to see Batman use his brain and also show us proof of his 20 year experience.

Why not counter the flame thrower with a freeze grenade....hinting at Mister Freeze?

We didn't see Batman use any of his gadgets or even his detective vision....which was in the BvS magazine.

	<TEXT> It only showed him that Superman isn't a monster and they relate in some way.

Batman wasn't fighting Superman because he thought "he was a monster". He was fighting on the one percent chance Superman will use his powers against the human race. Everybody knows Superman is a good person, he saves people everyday, but his unchecked power could spell a disaster when combined with politics and the media.


Afterall, it only takes one day of sadness/anger/loss of control for Superman to kill thousands of people. The knightmare showed us that...

In that moment, his nihilistic mental wall shattered and he realized he was no different than the man who murdered his parents.

I would absolutely understand this if Batman was not a killer in BvS and killing Superman was the only kill he was legitimzing to himself. Then, the comparison with his parent's killer makes sense.

However, this Batman just kills, those henchman who were told to move a piece of rock....all had families to go back to.

Superman's sacrifice is what restored his faith.

Was Batman's resolve so weak, that an alien he had hated for two years dying changed him.......

What about the innocent civilians and good police officers who die everyday. Wouldn't their deaths be more meaningful?

I honestly think this Batman is too far gone for Superman's death to affect him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He had to use extreme ways as time was running out to save Martha. Lex had still set a timer for her head and Batman had to act fast. And plus he was still incredibly angry at himself so that carried through.

Let's unpack this, shall we?

You stated that he was running out of time to save Martha, but his actions say otherwise.

Why would Batman, a veteran vigilante fight two dozen armed mercenaries, instead of taking the fastest route. Alfred had already sweeped the building and he could easily create a path of least resistance.

Why not attack stealthily from the floor below and take them by surprise instead of announcing his visit by mowing down two men?

KG Beast could have easily killed Martha in the time he was aimlessly fighting the goons....he wasted precious time.

Next you stated that he was incredibly angry at himself....but for what?

That he was about to kill Superman? 

That he couldn't kill Superman?

That Superman's mother is called Martha and is kidnapped by Luthor?

No matter how cool the warehouse fight was, it was a sloppy hostage rescue.

I mean, Batman was stupid enough to shoot a gas tank near an open flame.....one metre away from Martha.

KG Beast dies in the explosion, but somehow Batman's body and flimsy cape protected Martha......

	<TITLE> TIFU by sneezing and smashing my car 30 minutes before exams. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-03 14:44:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This was a few months ago, but I have never really talked about it with anyone.

So, it was exam day.....

Our family had two cars, one that my mum uses solely for work and one that my father and I share. Most of the time, my father takes me to uni - and then he goes off to work.

However, since the exams are taken elsewhere, I needed the car to get back home. The plan was to take my dad to work and then to go to the exam, which was at 8.30 in the morning. 

One last thing before I continue.....I was sick.

I had been sick for the last few days, sneezing like a rabid monster - but strangely enough.....I felt normal that day.

Everything was looking up.

I drive my dad to work at his office at around 7.40 am, and start driving to the exam venue. About five kilometres from my destination, I suddenly have a sneezing fit.

I was driving in a narrow part of the city, the street had two narrow lanes on either side and parking in the middle.

I was on the left lane going up the hill when I sneeze again.

This wasn't a normal sneeze, this was a bomb...

AAAAAAAAACHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

My hands jerk the wheel to the right and before I could course correct, I smashed into a parking meter.

I had never taken accidents seriously until that day.

I was going 40 km/h but when I hit the pole, the force was so vicious that I couldn't breathe.

It wasn't that bad, the airbags didn't even deploy, but for a solid 20 minutes - I couldn't stop shaking. Some kind citizens helped me get out of the vehicle.

It was 8.00 am.

10 minutes later, the police arrive to fill an accident report. Then a truck came to tow my car away.

This entire process took about 15 minutes.....during that entire time - I had forgotten about the exam.

8.25 am.

I gave the keys of the car to the tow truck driver and emptied out our belongings from the car.

Finally, I remembered my exam and this sinking feeling consumed me. 

I wouldn't be able to make it.

As I was walking aimlessly through the streets of the city, I felt this weird wetness on my thighs that I had not noticed.

Yes.....

^I ^wet ^myself.

**Was I so scared that I had urinated all over my light blue jeans??!!!**

So then followed the nightmare of taking public transport home, walking funny and smelling like piss and regret.

The car wasn't damaged badly, but it was totalled anyway. The insurance company that was covering the car found this loophole out of nowhere where it says a son/daughter still under the age of 23 was exempt of the insurance. My parents didn't think the exorbitant fee to repair the car was worth it...and decided to buy a new car with that money instead.

For proof, [here are two photos I took of the accident](http://imgur.com/a/YIzSJ).

TL;DR

- I sneezed while driving to my exam and crashed into a parking meter. 

- Missed the exam and urinated on myself.

- Took public transport while smelling of urine.



**Edit**: I talked with my subject coordinator and got to do the exam at a later date, so I was lucky there.

	<TEXT> Sorry, but the D.C. Reshoots posts are very well known. You acting like that don't exist doesn't make them untrue.

I seriously haven't seen these "well known posts".

So I'm asking again, do you have any links to a post on r/movies where people are shitting on the DCEU because of reshoots? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While any other movie gets the "it's normal" treatment.

People were freaking out when they heard Rogue One was going through major reshoots.

 This is undeniable and no one can legitimately disagree with me on this.

I simply asked if you have a link to a post where people are shitting on a DCEU movie for having reshoots.

If you don't have it, just say so....no need to get angry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's good fodder for r/movies to post so they can talk shit. 

The guys/gals at r/movies know that reshoots have no correlation with film quality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Justice League won't shy away from that, they will see bright suits, Aquaman and think that it should be fun before being good because it's a super-hero movie before being a movie...

It should be fun **because** it's good.

I honestly think WW will bridge the gap between serious period drama and "bright suit" comic book movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's certainly a chance that shooting out the tires could have been just as bad, but I can guarantee you the audience wouldn't have blinked an eye had Snyder shown the car spinning out and hitting a wall.

If you time it right, a shot tyre would just stop a car and not kill the driver/passengers. Police officers use the method quite a lot... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There were a few ways he could've taken down the SUV with the mini gun.

1 - He could dodge the Mini gun's direct fire, open the door to the Batmobile and shoot the car with an immobiliser. Then, he could to the same with the Mini Gun (the warehouse fight shows he has the tech to do it).

2- Approach stealthily, meaning the Mini gun would not even be in use.

3 - [He could pull the Batmobile in reverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnKrSncXs5E feature=youtu.be t=28), protecting him from the bullets. Then, he could open the two doors of the Batmobile and use them as a shield as he shoots some kind of non lethal bullet.

	<TEXT> You aren't in full control of anything in your life? That sucks for you, man. If being extremely nebbish gets you through the day, then go for it

**You are never in full control.**

You can decide to go to the store and buy milk, but a car crash can happen....stopping you from reaching your destination.

Human beings are never in full control, even when they think they are.

No shit, Sherlock

So why was it suddenly an issue when I was worried about a DCEU related matter?

Why the fuck do *you* care?

I seriously don't get people like you.

What did you gain from your altercation?

Did posting *"We should make a petition to force Jamaa to stop posting worrisome BS"* make you feel better?

Fucking pathetic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> why would I be worried about something I have no control over. 

Then why worry about anything?

We as humans are never in full control, are you saying we can't worry about *anything*?

...plenty of other things in the real world to worry about right now besides movies. 

....this is a DCEU sub

	<TEXT> Also as I have said for more than a year, since you have openly hated the DCEU since forever could you just fucking leave?

Although it's embarrassing, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/4blxcq/today_a_part_of_me_dies/) was one of the first few posts I wrote on this sub.....don't you fucking dare question my love for the DCEU.

I criticised BvS TC because I thought it was a bad movie.

I criticised SS because I thought it was a bad movie.

Simple as that...  </TEXT>
