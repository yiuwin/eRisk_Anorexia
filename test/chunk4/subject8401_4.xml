	<TEXT> Growing in the Republic of Texas is a new political party, the Texan Independence movement, whose goal is, as one can tell, the Independence of The Republic of Texas. This party is currently a both a small and old party, rivaling only the Texas Christian's party, with approximately 5,000 currently registered members, and of those most being supporters of the original secession of Texas. However, the Party is expected to grow further as word of it spreads to others who took part and supported the original secession of Texas back in the 2010's. While currently small and inconsequential, this new faction bears watching. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [DIPLOMACY] To America- Regarding greater Autonomy </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-15 02:07:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Government of The Republic of Texas would like to request greater autonomy from the United States of America. While this does not mean that Texas is declaring independence or is making plans to declare independence, It does mean that Texas wishes to have more freedom in opening Dialogue with foreign nations and the Deployment of troops to areas of conflict. The terms proposed by Texas are thus:  
    Permitting Texas to open dialogue with Foreign countries regarding economic matters within Texas  
    Permitting Texas to Contract Pmc's to carry out security on facilities required, or to provide 
    training  
    Permitting Texas to purchase arms and equipment form foreign countries  
Any additional concerns will be brought up, and these Terms may be discussed and changed. </TEXT>

While they currently have no chance of an election to high office, such as Governor or a member of his cabinet, they would definitely be able to secure seats in the Senate or House given time, money, and clever campaigning.  </TEXT>
