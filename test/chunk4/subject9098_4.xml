	<TEXT> But Bleach is sold with a lot of others manga that aren't necessarily for older viewers; about killing, how many gore-ish panels can you say that there are? The only one I can remember is Yama-jii being slashed and it wasn't that gore-ish so just cutting without dismembering and saying: John Doe is dead isn't really considered as "visual disclaimer advised".

Have to disagree with you in that second part, if the author didn't say it was wrong it is not implicit nor explicit that it is also wrong, it would be closer to right than wrong in this case.

There is a difference between Chinese mythology and Chinese Buddhism mythology, even because Chinese Buddhism is "Chinese" because it isn't from China. His Bankai comes from Buddhism, not Chinese Buddhism, the fact that Chinese Buddhism and Buddhism share some of their aspects is a different story. A simple analogy would be saying that American Football created Rugby.

Although they're mostly found in Japan, there are some found in China and Korea as well.

So why a Chinese sword? If Japan is where you can mostly find those trees it would make much sense, but the one I brought, and the one that I believed to be true until Kubo proved me wrong made sense at some level, Chinese sword, firework sounds, the bright colours, all pointing to Chinese mythology, if I didn't say before I'll say it now, there is a Chinese tradition, still alive today that said that fireworks were used as a form to scare and dispel things and the ancient Chinese would pass on to their children that the fireworks would scare the dragons so they would attack their village in any way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Self-harm basically. For instance, Hellsing was a manga for 18 plus so - most - people wouldn't be stupid to attempt crazy things that the manga had shown, but Bleach had a wider audience with young people included, if Kisuke to increase his powers had to hurt himself, some people might think it would be okay to self-harm, so to avoid any future suing, Shonen might have advised Kubo to not continue with the self-harm thing to avoid legal issues.

Why can't you base it on the anime? It wasn't filler, so as long as Kubo don't say it is wrong, I don't think that "can't really base things off of the anime" is a legit argument. Also, it is easy to say now that it was based in buddhism - note that it is not "Chinese God of Mercy" as you said -, before the revelation of Kisuke's bankai there wasn't much to go on, so on my research I've come across a myth on Chinese culture involving dragons and fireworks, so it did make kind of sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Impressive attention on details, I believe that Kubo, originally, wanted to use that blood thing, however with the impact that the manga has and being a weekly manga the publisher must have noticed that as well and "advised" him to not doing because it could have been seen as an apology of cutting oneself and since Bleach can be read by anyone Kubo backed out with his plans, unfortunately.

Also, if I'm not mistaken, some people have pointed that out before, but I disregarded because they didn't use the same image that you did, so I'd prefer believing on Kisuke's Bankai being something related to fireworks and dragons - Chinese mythology - for the sound that the anime implied to its attacks, also the sword's design. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really, easy? I died so many times, I misjudged the damage I was taking and would die 5 times per phase until the fourth one, then I had a lot of tonics and a bunch of life. I thought the first one was easier on that point.

What do you think is boring about the story? The fact that you are running after your daughter or the meaningless tasks that you are obliged to do just to get that train moving or is it something else?

On a side note, I think that Lamb was a pretty lame enemy, not that I wanted another fight such as the one against Fontaine from the last game, but she didn't have any charisma. Also, I was a bit disappointed with Sinclair and how the things turned out for him, not that I was hoping that he would pull out an Atlas, but really disappointed. Also, I've just remember Tenenbaum was there for 5 minutes and then gone, maybe they could have used her more, idk.

I didn't like the shotgun, nor that "spear gun", even though it was funny impaling enemies with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, that's why several conquerors killed so many people in History, they were worried that this many people would destroy the planet, so they would wait for them to reproduce and then killed then, for instance a greatgrandma has a daughter with greatgrandad, if the conqueror killed both in every family the Earth population would decrease 2/3. You should be thanking Genghis Khan for that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that "normal" Metalgreymon was able to evolve into infected Wargreymon without digivice intervention is worth mentioning? That digimon with the red scarf was in the distortion again, probably, so can we be sure now that he is the catalyst for mega evolution?

Could Gennai and thaT woman always grinning be interested on the orginal digivices or their crests? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> PhD Haddaway has imposed a similar question on early 90's, he would inquire what was the purpose of this feeling because his significant other would bluntly injure his sentiments, so far he wasn't able to find a real answer for that questioning, but maybe, some day, people will be able to learn: "what is love?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Apparently" it seems most people haven't played the first two before playing the third, I'd recommend anyone to play, the first can come as a little bit dull and boring - if you like Assassin's Creed, is the same feeling as playing the first one after playing the second or any other after that - but it is quite amazing. </TEXT>
