om polisen antyder att man inte borde vara p plats r det fr en amerikan i princip likvrdigt med att bli fysiskt avvisad, om man inte avlgsnar sig direkt nr en amerikansk polis sger vad svenska polisen sa till honom kan man ltt frvnta dig en WWE bodyslam takedown och en skarpladdad pistol kommer frmodligen komma ur sitt holster  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the US and france are not comparable in that sense

the US has value to leverage against the corporate tax rate to entice a corporation to do business there. France has less of that, you need to evaluate what works for each country instead of comparing straight numbers between two countries that are in very difference economic situations.

and for reference, Sweden has 22% corporate tax rate, denmark 24.5%. This is not because sweden and denmark are more capitalist than the US - but because sweden and denmark, much like france but to a greater degree, lack the market attraction that the US has. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well it's all relative to where you start from

I'm not sure if Bernie would be against lowering the rates that france currently has, I think Bernie is a realist and would weigh the job market costs against the tax gains and make a decision from there rather than have a pre-set condition that taxes neeed to go up for rich people. What I do know is that Bernie used the Nordic model as a good example to draw from but not necessarily an example to mirror, and it seems Macron is doing something similar.

and by the way, the "nordic model" is all about pragmatism over idealism and it's what makes it different from generic leftist politics </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well the full context is - 20.00: the police are in the process of arresting a guy, with arrest warrant, at or near by the rinkeby subway station and a nearby group of people starts throwing rocks (because they were arresting "one of their own"), police fires a shot (no one hit) and the group disperses and the arrest is completed. 

shortly after this, reports came in of burning cars in the area, 7-8 reportedly at first. If this is related to the arrest incident or not is up to you I guess.

22.00 About 2 hours after the arrest more reports come in about rocks being thrown, police spokesperson says there was a crowd of people (30-50 people) walking together throwing rocks. Stores were looted and 2 people were physically assaulted, one of whom was a store owner of a looted store. Riots stopped around midnight

no further arrests have been made

	<TEXT> ill just echo what I said in other comments

isn't it interesting how russian defeats are seen as evidence of how russian infantry has to be a genocide fiesta to be historical but all other nation's defeats at the hands of russia has to have some circumstance that made it happen; from frederick to sweden to commonwealth to ottomans to napoleon it's never the russian military that put a stop to them but some freak storm or political circumstance. the fact is russia inflicted that "worst defeat" of frederick the great where no other nation could and yet prussia gets uber space marine ideas and russia doesn't even get ideas on par with austria (who repeatedly got slaughtered 2:1 vs prussia in the war) or ottomans (who lost many many battles in numerical superiority to russia, while repeatedly beating the austrians in the same war)

and isn't it funny how as soon as you start talking about how russia should at least have the baseline european military ideas like a tiny bit discipline or morale people start defending prussian ideas </TEXT>

	<TEXT> relative to russia prussia's performance on the battlefield does not warrant a 20% morale 7.5% discipline 20% inf combat gap. If there's one thing prussia did better than russia it is the size of their army relative to population, which would translate to force limit bonuses in-game. Russia should have a *low* forcelimit and high manpower for their development for historical accuracy, not high. Sweden and Prussia should have high forcelimits and low manpower recovery, not the other way around as they do and on discipline/morale/combat ability russia should be at least better than austria and probably on par with poland minus hussar cav combat ability

if anything austria should not have morale or discipline seeing as they are the ones who got their asses kicked by inferior numbers consistently. in the battles russia participated they fought prussia evenly while in the game a prussian 20 stack can wipe the entire russian army

I'm not necessarily saying prussia needs to be weaker but I am saying russia should have *some* military ideas outside manpower and forcelimit

it's interesting how talking about buffing russia elicits "dun nerf muh aryan space marines" so quickly, though.

	<TEXT> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Borodino france won a nominal victory on the battlefield but where every european power had been forced to capitulate russia was the first to deal a heavy blow and halted the french advance

napoleon had to retreat and regroup because of this battle, not the winter - he started the retreat before the severety of the winter was even apparent. Even if he was able to burn moscow before retreating napoleon could not have advanced on russia even without the winter

but isn't it interesting how the first instinct to any russian military feat is to blame some enabling circumstance like the weather (napoleon) or political disarray (commonwealth) in the enemy but we don't do this in reverse when russia suffered large losses and instead give other nations discipline, morale, and combat ability all over the place </TEXT>

	<TEXT> russia also beat the biggest army ever seen under the "best general" ever seen (napoleon) which is the "end game" of eu4 and was the only nation to have a successful campaign against france (second coalition in italy)

I guarantee you if this guy was swedish or german it would be a national idea or event "gain +135235% morale for 50 years"

also how does prussian performance in the seven years war pretty much on its own warrant the best military ideas in the game when russian performance in the same war gives them nothing? when the only reason prussia even survived as a state is because russia switched sides in the war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kunersdorf the russian army clearly could compete 1:1 with prussia so this thing with paradox just wanting a punching bag for sweden needs to go away for the sake of a better game

and the sweden-russia war is the turning point for russian strength, peter the great is named "the great" because he created russia as a military power. before him russia could not muster an army to compete with european armies but under and after peter the great they crushed not one but three of the (then) major european powers (sweden, commonwealth, ottomans) in quick succession 

1768 is part of what I call "later half" of eu4 period  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> on a similar note I think they need to revamp russia too

the orthodox faith needs an update and if ottomans can have cores on their entire neighborhood and an extra pip on their starting units and all the railroading they put in to make them strong early, russia needs something similar in the later game

the russian empire was a much bigger power factor in than ottomans during the later half of the eu4 period

a big part of fixing this could just be done by either giving them discipline and morale or just nerfing discipline and combat ability across the board. The idea that russian empire troops were as weak as they are in this game is just stupid and borderline bigotry (saying this as a swedish person lol)

also the change of tech cost reduction to +institution spread at the end of the idea tree has to be the worst nerf to a national idea ever </TEXT>
