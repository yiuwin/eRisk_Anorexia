	<TEXT> I just ran around exploring, doing shrines and getting to the tops of towers. By the time I even had all towers (which is the very first thing I did) I don't believe my equipment was that bad. Couldn't get lynels but I could kill hinoxs. I don't know any specific quests for better equips but shrines will some times give some. My fav set is the barbarian I won't spoil where you get it but it's not hard to google. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah dude, lots of lynels need to be killed to upgrade barbarian armor fully. At first I was the same, but after a few and figuring out a good technique, it was a lot better. I still die occasionally but not nearly as often. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it's quite a bit of work to get it all upgraded. I only have my barbarian set fully upgraded and even that took me a day or 2 of lynel hunting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Upgraded 4 times on each piece that can be upgraded is max. 4 stars on each one. 
If you really have all armor, koroks, shrines and memories. The next best thing I would do is upgrade all my armor. I've been slowly working at everything. To have it 100% (besides koroks) for when DLC comes out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Best 1h weapon I've seen for sure, all my lynel swords are even close. The best I ever had was a 101 2h lynel crusher. Wish I would've known about it not breaking when mounting a lynel before it broke though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't even do that but I got it no problem. I was trying to 'force' a blood moon but nothing happened after 5-10 nights. So I just played the game normally and when I noticed it starting to happen, just went to the shrine and made it with more than enough time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find this too chancy to try. When 'snowling' worked for me so much better for making money. I only did it earlier in the game though as I have 13k rupees and don't even know what to do with them now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is how I always fight them. It's cheap, but it works. I usually don't even stasis. I am good enough at dodging that if I miss with an arrow I can usually dodge and hit him with an arrow again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's how I get him. Although the lightning one is easy too. Just go to lakeside stable, wait until morning and head over to the bridge, he should come down one of the water falls.  </TEXT>
