	<TEXT> He thinks of me. Sounds silly. I've been in two abusive relationships before I found him. He will be at the store and see something I need (when.I did not ask) and get it for me. 

She said her back was  hurting? I see a messager  at walgreens when picking up snacks. Get It for her! She was complaining her blue nail polish ran out? I'll grab some!

It's not just stuff he buys me, it's the thought. She said she is frustrated and stressed ? Let me do the dishes. Let me put the kid to bed. Shit I don't ask for that he perceives because he pays attention? Sheer gold.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know there are a few web pages that do online therapy. I don't think they take insurance though but it's cheaper out of pocket than regular therapy. I did a free trial of one and I personally hated it. I think you can find ones where you do it in a Skype-like setting but the one I tried was just a chat box. It took the therapist really long to type and I could tell he was not paying attention to me because I would say something like "I've never had an all out panic attack" and 15 min later he would say "I know you mentioned you have crippling panic attacks, tell me more." The sessions were still half an hour but we got so little done because typing takes longer than conversing. Maybe I just got a bad one. If it's your only option though and you have the money, I would give it a shot. I'm sure there are better ones out there. I just tried that one because the first week was free.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 200% agree. I spent some time in recovery for bulimia and met a lot of  overly skinny girls with terrible food issues. Normal weight and even "chubby" people can have issues too. Sorry Maybe my original post needs to emphasize that more. 

Sometimes when someone will talk to me about wanting to lose weight, I'll ask if they have food issues. If they say no and they are looking to lose 5-50 lbs (roughly)  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. If they are super overweight and say no, I have a lot more trouble giving them the benefit of the doubt because I was in denial and in my head you don't just get as big as I was without some issue.

God that who paragraph sounds so judgmental and bitchy, I hope it doesn't come off that way, I just really want  them to consider it carefully. I'm glad you pointed out that people of all sizes can have issues too. That absolutely needs to be seen.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tough love in regards to food, psychological issues and getting help. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Losing a massive amount of weight is a journey, and it is just as much a psychological one as a physical one. I always recommend that for those of you who have or need to lose a large amount of weight, to seek therapy if at all it is available to you. That's pretty much the main point of this post. Below is the tough love. 


Let's face it, for some of us, it's impossible to deny that something is wrong with our brains. I'm not talking about the people who are 15, 30, heck even 50 lbs overweight (depending on your height). I'm talking about people around the 100 pound club and beyond. For the longest time I always told myself I didn't have psychological issues with food. I was not a food addict. I did not self medicate with food. I never ate a whole pint of ice cream in one sitting. I never went to multiple fast food restaurants in a day. I wasn't broken, I had just gotten a little fat. 


It's taken me a long time to see how adept I was (and still can be) at lying to myself. Now don't get me wrong. You can ABSOLUTELY have psychological food issues and not even be overweight. (Heck you can be underweight, as many are.) Still, I feel once you get as big as I did, claiming not to have emotional issues with food is not very believable anymore, considering I was killing myself. 


Even after I began to think that maybe I had some sort of problem, I told myself I was just really good at being in denial. Yeah, that was it. I was in denial. No big deal right? Sure I was really big but I had not noticed how big, so it's just that I was not paying attention right? No psychological issues here! Tell me, if you knew someone who was told they needed a heart transplant say Nah, I'm fine, wouldn't that just be denial? Yep. Denial is a big-effing-deal. It's a big deal when you are literally killing yourself with food and it's a big deal when you start practicing unsafe diet methods. (Just skip a few meals here, throw up a little there, binge a little here, it's all good, right? I don't have an eating disorder.) 


I don't know all of you. Heck, I don't know 99.9% of you. All I want for those reading this is to take a really hard look at themselves and maybe consider the possibility that you didn't get to where you are/were without something going on in your heads that needed adjusting. People don't wake up and decide to drink themselves to death. People don't wake up and decide to to starve themselves to death, and people who are using food as a slow form of suicide do not get that way without forces other than their forks and plates. 


Consider that maybe we ended up here because there's something more to it than just over eating and under exercising. And if you got that way with the help of psychological issues, it only makes sense that you might need some psychological tools to get yourself out of it. You can fix half the leaks in your oil tank, but you're not going to completely stop leaking oil until you fix them all. 


Thanks for reading. I'll get off my soapbox now. I love this community and I care, please believe that. I've just had to deal with a lot of grief because of my denial/food issues and I feel like getting help early can be extremely important.

	<TEXT> My daughter saved my life. She was not a child of rape, but she still did. I was a college dropout working a dead-end job, doing drugs and living in a horrendously shitty two-bedroom apartment with like eight other people. My boyfriend was a drug dealer and I got knocked up at 20. 

The moment I found out I was pregnant I left the apartment (and eventually my abusive boyfriend) never touched another drug and went back to college. After my daughter was born I lost 130 lbs (I was 270) because I wanted to set a healthy example. I graduated and got into a program to help me pay for my master's degree as long as I agreed to teach Special Education at a low income school. I'm almost done with that now. 

I have a good job, I published a novel  few months ago and I have been with the man of my dreams for over three years who considers my daughter his own. We live in a 3 bedroom house with two dogs, two cats and a whole lot of stability and love. 

I never would have done it if it had not been for her. I didn't love myself enough to be better, but I loved her and she needed a better mom. As I got myself together I began to love myself too because I was beginning to see I was worth it. People always tell me "Wow, you did all this in spite of having a kid!" No, I did it BECAUSE I had a kid. Girl Saved. My. Life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love that you included all the good and the bad parts of weight loss and the psychological tournament that can go on when you experience this journey. It really never ends. Some of us who had a lot to lose always focused on hitting a target and once we did I think we subconsciously told ourselves that we would finally be done. It's not done. It's never done. Maintaining is just as hard as losing.

I suffer from bulimia. I purged enough to put my life at risk and needed emergency surgery. I relapsed again last august after four years "recovered". At this point I know what I need to do to get better and I'm slowly getting back there again. I'd never trade my weight loss for anything in the world but sometimes I'm just so tired. I hope to find the balance you have one day. Just have to keep trying for it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much I really appreciate your response. That is a really good idea about making my own individual lunches instead of forcing myself to eat something I don't want. I never considered changing my containers. That is a good idea. They are pretty old. 

As far as a thought process, I don't really have a back story going on in my head as to why I think the food is contaminated. It's more of a psychological response. I'll smell it and at times, though not often, I might think it smells bad even though it's not and could not possibly be. Most of the time the reaction is more of a texture thing. I'll hit an itty bitty hard part when eating some leftover beef and then get grossed out and feel like I have to throw the rest away. If an onion is under-cooked and crunches or seems too cooked and slimy, I have the same reaction. My standards for how perfect the food must be for me to finish it are insanely high. One bad bite and I won't eat it and the meal is ruined. I notice it only happens with leftovers and not fresher meals. 

Maybe part of my ED brain thinks if something is not absolutely perfect, then why am I "wasting" my calories eating it, when there is something else I could enjoy more. The problem is, since I've been losing interest in food, I can never seem to come up with what exactly I would enjoy eating more. I don't keep junk food in my house, but on the off chance it's here, I will eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner until it's gone. A friend of mine left a bag of jolly ranchers here and I ate nothing but that for like 1.5 days. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person with an ED who still eats junk food when given the opportunity. I didn't binge the candy though, I just ate it slowly over 36 hours and that was all I ate because I couldn't think of anything in the house I wanted more than candy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (skip to the # if you don't want a back story)

I was diagnosed with BN in 2010 and it was really bad. I went through recovery and had been relapse free for four years. I ended up relapsing due to a change in my medication, getting off birth control, having my thyroid give out on me and surviving a week long list of work events surrounded by all my trigger food. It was basically a perfect storm. I still take responsibility for it, but my environment and hormones were a mess. 

A few months after my relapse I started seeing a shrink and things have gotten a lot better, but I am still purging on and off in little stints. 


(#)


My problem right now is that I'm having trouble eating leftovers. I'm a mom and I cook for my family. We are not destitute or anything, but money is tight and we don't have room for waste. I cook a lot and so I usually only buy raw ingredients and make everything from scratch to save money. This also prevents me from a binge because there are no snacks. 

The past few weeks I've completely lost interest in food. I'll walk into the kitchen 100 times a day and stare into the refrigerator and nothing will look good. If I force myself to eat something that is not appealing to me, I quickly get grossed out and purge or only have a few bites of it before I can't take it anymore. 

When I cook a big meal for my family, I usually have no trouble eating because I cook something that appeals to me at the time. We always have leftovers and use them as lunches for the next day. The thing is, every time I try to eat leftovers now, I just get totally grossed out. I start thinking there is something wrong with the food. Like it's contaminated or slimy or rotten even though it isn't. I throw things away that I think smell or look funny even though logically I knew they could not have expired yet. My mind is playing tricks on me and if I eat it, I feel like I'm going to be sick. 

I haven't binged in months but every time I make myself eat something I don't want to, or something left over, I can't finish it and I feel sick. Because of this the purging is starting to ramp up again. Sometimes I keep it down. Sometimes I don't. Anyone else experienced this? Any advice? I don't have medical insurgence any more so I have not seen my therapist in about 6 months.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On top of that, now places of business seem like they are required to say "We are always taking applications" when you ask if they are hiring. (This more applies to entry level stuff.)

"Hey, are you guys hiring?"
"We are always taking applications!"
"Yeah, but are you really hiring?"
"We are always taking applications..."

It's like, Jesus Christ! 90% of getting a job is going in and asking at the right time when there is a position that needs to be filled. If you have no open positions just tell me instead of wasting my time filling out your stupid application that asks questions that are already answered in my resume. 

I swear, the entire hiring process is designed to fuck your weekend without actually getting hired.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with the points you made in the first two paragraphs, but not the last. Women being home makers does not lead to happier lives over all. Having enough money where one parents gets to stay home makes for happier lives over all. It doesn't matter if it's the man or the woman who gets to stay home. 

I was more arguing that some overly-zealous feminists mistake the feminist original mission of "I should be allowed to have a choice between a career and being a home maker" for "No girl should ever want to be a home maker." Even though I now have a good career that I can do from home where I can be both, I still get flack I suppose.  </TEXT>

I excitedly told some of my friends, "Yeah and It's great. I can work and still be with my daughter. I can cook and clean and work on my own schedule. It will be great when I want to have more kids."

I got a lot of flack for being excited about staying at home, cooking, cleaning and making babies. What's wrong with that. I *want* to do all those things and I also *want* to have a career. Why can't I have both? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I was raised in a religious cult. Got out when I was 16, almost 17. I graduated high school and went to college where I went completely wild due to all the repression before.

I started dating my weed dealer. He knocked me up. We got married and the relationship became extremely abusive. After four years together I left him. 

I went on to lose 110 lbs (I was 270 at 5'5" before) because I hated myself. I did it in the wrong way and developed bulimia so severe that I had to be hospitalized and had to have emergency surgery to save my life. After I was discharged I gained all the weight back because all I ever knew was either over-eating, or binging and purging. 

Decided I loved my daughter too much to check out of life early(I'm all she has). I would not let my eating disorder kill me and I would not let obesity kill me. 

I re-enrolled in college and graduated a year later with my bachelor's degree in English, despite the fact that  I have severe dyslexia and could not read until 3rd grade. I lost 130 lbs in a healthy way and became a health nut. I also landed a really great job and met the man of my dreams. I'm a year away from my master's degree. I WILL give my daughter the happy life she deserves.  </TEXT>

She got so embarrassed that she started to cry and he and I both set her up on the couch to sleep it off. A few days later I asked him "If it were a guy that said/did that and not a girl, would you have let him stay?" and he was like "fuck no."

	<TITLE> How the world shows me (a bisexual), that it still thinks gay sex doesn't count </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-21 02:19:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last night I ended up in a situation I've grown all too familiar with. I'm at a gathering and learn from one friend or another that there is another bisexual or lesbian girl who is interested in me. Honestly? I'm flattered, but always politely decline. See I have a boyfriend. One who I currently am missing very badly right now as he has been gone for three months to a school offered by the military out of state. 


As usual, my friend asks me why I'm declining and I have to tell her something she knows all too well. I have a boyfriend.  Then out come the surprised questions that pop up like well-oiled clockwork. What? You mean he cares? It's just a girl. It's not really cheating. *Great.* I've never had to explain it to one friend more than once, most of mine are rather respectful, but It always blows me away that in general (Or at least maybe in my age demographic or in my geographic area) people assume that gay sex doesn't count. 


I'm only twenty-seven and I'm already tired of people calling me Katy-Perry Gay. I'm tired of men thinking it's a hot kink and I'm tired of lesbians thinking I'm doing it for attention or that I'm not being honest with myself and that I'm actually all the way gay. In any standard heterosexual or all-homosexual relationship, most people would not suggest one partner cheat while the other was away. When you're bisexual it's almost assumed that you can't keep it in your pants. It's also assumed that you are allowed to have sex with other people as long as they are the same sex as you are. It irks me. Why is that the default?


I've met people in open relationships who are very happy and I think that's great. They agree they are allowed to sleep with other people, or date other people, or same sex people or certain other people. That's cool and it's not cheating because it was agreed to by both partners. It's not for me, but I respect people who want to do that. I just don't understand why a bisexual who is allowed to sleep with other same-sex partners is considered standard instead of an open relationship. I feel like it cheapens my sexuality. It tells me there's no way I could *really* fall in love with a girl because I'm not *really* gay. It tells me that to them, gay sex doesn't count.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend is in the Army and so on week days he has to go to bed really early, which works for me because I get up early on week days too. I totally get that the poor guy wants to stay up late on the weekends. We stay up late together and play video games and watch movies really late, but sometimes he can stay up all night and I can't. 

For some strange reason if I go to bed alone and then wake up at like 4 or 5 am and he still has not come to bed, I get SUPER irritated in my half-asleep brain. I don't let myself nag him and I realize this is a problem on my part and not his. Anyone dealt with this or know why it bothers me so much? It's hard to get my head around it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally understandable. I totally get that I can politely say no. I do/would if/when i'm directly asked out. I can even say no when someone offers to help me with something. I guess in all actuality, my biggest issue is being showered with compliments because it's hard to say "no" when someone is like "You're gorgeous!" Then you either come off like a b**** or a girl who needs to be convinced. 

Congrats on your weight loss! It's always exciting to meet another big loser.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The neighbors came by earlier tonight and told me that they found a cat in the road. It was Pho Pho. He had already passed when I got there. I'm completely devastated. 

He was such a fighter. None of the other cats in the neighborhood would mess with him. When I was pregnant or when I was sick, he always brought me birds and insects. He was a master hunter, and completely tolerant of all of Cora's (my daughter) love. When Cora got hurt a few years back, I stayed in bed for days. Every day he would come into my room with a dead animal as if to say, "Here, eat something."

I lovingly referred to him as "My big man" and "Little Asshole." People who say cats don't love their people are wrong. At least, they were about him. He loved me. He greeted me with headbutts. He went on walks with dogs. He caught birds out of the air, and he always came when I called. The world lost a bad-ass today, and I have lost a piece of my heart. 

Rest easy my big man. I love you.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. Living together for 2.5 years. 10 weeks ago he left for a military school over 1,000 miles away. It's one of the hardest ones in the army. He is in school from the crack of dawn until about 5 pm and then has to study for at least four hours a day. He's busy. 

When he first left it was really hard being away from him, but now I'm starting to get used to it, and for some reason that makes me worried. Insane right? I mean I still miss him terribly but I'm getting used to it and then that worries me because maybe he is getting used to it too. we've gone from talking on the phone three times a week to maybe once every five days. We text pretty often though. The internet there is awful so we can't skype or face-time. 

I'm going out to visit him in three days and I'm literally vibrating with excitement, but now for some reason I'm also nervous. It makes no god-damn sense. Our relationship is rock solid. We want to get married and I'm, not worried about our future. I'm just super anxious. Is this normal? I feel like he has not done anything wrong and everything is wonderful and we miss one another so much, yet my emotions are self-sabotaging me. I'm worried and uneasy and anxious as if our relationship were in trouble, yet it's not. Why brain? Why!?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I met my friend at NMSU. She dropped out two years into her degree because her mom and step-mom (who she was very close to) died within two months of one another. She moved back to Socorro and moved in with her boyfriend who lived there.  This already had me concerned because he is the biggest piece of shit I've ever met.

Anyway, after almost two years she announced that she was going back to NMSU in August. She broke up with her boyfriend about two days ago. He was abusing her horribly. The only issue is that she is still living with him and has nowhere to go. She's afraid. She called me and I offered to let her live with me until school starts. (She already has an apartment in Las Cruces waiting for her in August). She wants to come but the only issue is that she has no job here in El Paso.  She has car payments and such. 

Is there anywhere in El Paso that is always hiring? It's fine if it's entry level. Maybe something with a high turnover rate? She won't come unless I can find something for her. I'm worried for her and I want to help.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad is a very smart engineer. He moved to the USA (Indianan) from Argentina with his parents right before he went to college. In the USA he was ostracized because a lot of the other boys in school told everyone he was a "fag" (their words, not mine) due to the cultural difference. In Latin american countries, men are much more open with their feelings and warm and loving with their other male friends. 

My father's parents forced him to give up his dream of being a musician (he was VERY good) to peruse a degree in engineering. He struggled through the program but eventually made it through. He worked on his English and got to a point where nobody would have ever expected that he was not born and raised in the USA (He is very white looking, and his parents were natives from the USA before he was born.) 

He worked in a job he hated his whole life (so far). All this made him a very cold and distant man. Calculating and unfeeling. I suspect that my father never wanted children but he loved my mother and so he gave them to her. My brother and I have always known our father loved us, but we were never shown much warmth. At most we were mess makers and annoying distractions that he also loved, which made our relationship very complicated. Still, he worked and worked himself at a job he hated to provide for us. 

A few years ago my dad made a friend with a guy from Mexico. They would sit on the back porch and rattle on and on in Spanish and I would see my father's eyes twinkle. I would hear his loud belly-laugh and see him joke around. He was a different man in Spanish. I wanted to know that man. I've been trying to learn Spanish, but I'm still not very good and when I try to talk to him in Spanish, he makes it hard because he is a perfectionist and always getting frustrated and correcting me. 

I feel like a warm and loving father lies in my dad. The dad who speaks Spanish. I feel all his burdens and troubles that made him hard, are on the shoulders of the English speaking father. I long to meet the man from Argentina.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually kinda hate exercising with people. Even when my boyfriend and I go to the gym together, we immediately break apart into our own separate routines with our headphones on. On the off chance we are both doing the same kind of cardio, we will pick an elliptical or treadmill next to one another, but we don't talk and 99% of the time we don't go to the gym together at all. We have very different schedules.

I have a lot of other female friends who lift but none of them live close enough to me for us to realistically work out together. Every so often I'll get a girl from work or school or one of my kid's friend's mom ask to come with me. I don't think I've had the same person ever go with me more than twice. I'm usually there longer than they want to be, doing things they don't want to do at a pace they are not comfortable with. 

Even before I lost 135lbs, I didn't like working out with other people. I was serious and they were not and I had friends actually get mad at me because I was going to *run* on my run instead of speed-walk and chat. 

If you can find someone who likes to exercise the way that you do, is at or around the same level as you, and has the same drive, that is fantastic. Still, I think at least starting out alone is better. It helps you build a base for making the habit. That way if your partner quits or can't make it or moves or gets injured, it's not an excuse to just fucking quit. 

(I swear I'm not as intense as I sound)

	<TEXT> I was just waiting in a long line for my medication at Walgreen's. There was a drunk guy ahead of me in line and he kept saying to my five year old daughter "You have such beautiful eyes." I was friendly and smiled while he tried to talk to me, but it was a long line and his comments started getting more and more inappropriate as he turned his attention to me. I mentioned my husband (I actually have a boyfriend not a husband) and the guy went on about what kind of a husband doesn't get his wife a ring. At this point he started telling me how sexy he thought I was and I firmly told him that he was being inappropriate. He got called next in line, and soon I was called to the other teller. I got my meds and took my daughter's hand, relieved to see that drunk-guy was nowhere to be seen. As we started making our way out the door, I saw he was standing outside the door in the corner where I wouldn't be able to see him right away. I spotted him just as we were crossing the threshold of the door and I said loudly "Oops sweetie! We forgot something!" and grabbed her hand and went back into the store. 

I pretended to be browsing the isles but really I was watching those mirrors they have hung at an angle near the ceiling. Sure enough, drunk guy was following me down every isle, making sure to always be an isle behind me. I finally turned down a isle and saw a big brawny guy with a scary-looking goatee who must have been 6'3". He was looking at the toys with his toddler-aged son. I walked up to him and whispered "There's a guy following me, can you please walk me to my car?" The guy didn't hesitate. 

We walked to the next isle where his wife was and told his son "Stay with mommy" and whispered to his wife that I was being followed and needed someone to walk me to my car. As we walked away I mouthed "Thank you!" to her and she gave me a nod. When we got outside, drunk guy was nowhere in sight (most likely still in the store) and brawny goatee guy made sure I got to my car with my little girl safe and sound. I said thank you quickly a few times before I drove off, but in all honesty I was dying to speed away before drunk guy could hop in a car and follow me.    

I'm pretty shook up right now. I don't know what would have happened but I'm SO GRATEFUL brawny goatee guy helped without a moment's hesitation. In the car I realized just how much danger I was asking him to put himself in for a stranger. The drunk guy could have had a weapon, or gotten in a fight with him. 

To all you guys and girls out there willing to stick your necks out for strangers THANK YOU. And thank you to his wife for understanding and not getting upset over the idea of her husband walking another girl to her car.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Been there, done that. He cheated on me with seven different women (and at least ten men), got me pregnant, wouldn't let me leave the house for weeks at a time, and after I left him, told me he was not interested in helping raise our daughter (not that I really wanted him to). 

I'm now happy with a wonderful man who makes me want to pinch myself every day to see if I'm dreaming. He is a wonderful father to my daughter and I plan to marry him and screw his brains out till we die.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend is ten years older than me. It doesn't really effect our relationship much, but we are so crazy about each other that sometimes I get sad thinking about how there was this whole apart of his teen/adult life that he had without me. Like, I'm 27 and in love with him, but when he was 27, he didn't have me. I know it's weird. 

Anyway I had a dream once where I met him when he was like 16 (He looked just like he did in the photo albums when he was a teen) and for some reason I was 15. We started making out in his parents basement. Things started getting hot and heavy and I woke up. I finished myself imagining screwing my bf at the age of 16 and I was 15. I told him about it later. He laughed, but said that was super weird. 

What's strange is I am not attracted to younger guys. Not even guys my own age really. No idea why but I came so hard. Was weird.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My daughter is amazing at saying awkward stuff. She's five. Just last week I was picking her up from school. She has been asking a ton of questions about the equality movement ever since they studied Martin Luther King Jr.  Her best friend is also the only black kid in the entire school. So a week ago, she hugged her friend goodbye and as we walked away, we passed her friend's mom making her way towards the school pushing a stroller with her friend's baby brother in it. My daughter turned to me and loudly said "BLACK PEOPLE HAVE BLACK BABIES!"  Nice... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I passed over a dozen gallstones before the doctors would take me seriously. It felt like I was having a heart attack every time and I would go to the ER and they would send me home saying I had heartburn. Then one day I went to the ER twice because even the painkillers they gave me were not taking the edge off. They did an ultrasound and saw that I had made a gallstone so big that it had impacted and I had pancreatitis and was going septic. I didn't know it until after surgery but they told me I could have died.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Way to go! You should be so proud of yourself!!! I had the same experience about a year back. Also at Old Navy. I was clothes shopping with my friends and we were all being funny and tried to see what the smallest size we could fit into was. I grabbed a size two, joking about how it would most likely not be able to get past my thighs. 

Went into the changing room. Slipped up right on and zipped up. Perfect fit. My friends wondered why I was taking so long and when I came out I was crying. Kinda killed the mood for them until I told them it was because I was happy. 

Keep fighting the good fight OP. You should be on top of the world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My parents dated for four years before they got married. They have an amazing relationship to this day. I got pregnant at 20 and after dating the father for four years, I thought "Well I guess that means we should get married." I had strong doubts. Still, I figured we already had a kid together. Either shit or get off the pot right? Besides, all my doubts were just nerves right? We'd been together four years so it's solid right? I remember I would look into his eyes and ask myself "Is this the man you want to spend the rest of your life with?" My gut said no even though I pretended it didn't.

We divorced six months later. 

I can't give solid evidence that my new relationship is any different. We've been together for three years and he has made me the happiest girl in the world. We knew at six months we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. The only reason we are not married already is due to money. Sometimes, you just know.  Maybe it's not the same for everyone, but I just know. It's not about how long you are together, as long as you *really* know them. I look in his eyes and can see us traveling the world in an RV in our 80's. 

Yes, I'm a sappy, sappy person... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are a huge inspiration to me!! I've lost 135 lbs and I also have loose skin. I remember seeing your video on here before it went viral and then a few days later I was in the doctor's office and I saw two people next to me watching your video. It was crazy!! I wish I was as brave as you, to show the part of my belly that I tuck into my panties, but I'm not there yet. Lifting has helped me a bit though!

	<TEXT> Here is a tip. If you need to get something important done after a long days work, when you get home, DO NOT sit down. As soon as you move your body from active to sedentary, it's much harder to get up the umph to get going again. I know it's been a long hard day but if you do it as soon as you get home and don't sit down, it's easier.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The pockets and regular mini-pizzas are made with the same ingredients and the same ratios, so the calories are the same. 

Dough

1 pouch (or one TBS dry yeast)

1 tsp salt

2-3 cups of flour

1 cup of warm water

Directions - knead together ingredients. Make sure the water is luke warm. If it's too hot you will kill your yeast. The flower ratio is different because it will depend on the humidity of where you live. You want it moist enough to have it all stick together with no excess flour, but not so sticky that it sticks to your hands. Knead well. Remember, it's easier to add flour than have to add more water, so knead in flour in small amounts until it's right. 

Sauce

1/3 cup tomato sauce (I use the kind from the can)
 
1 tsp salt

1tsp ground oregano

1/2 tsp black pepper

1/2 tsp onion powder

1/2 tsp garlic powder

Directions

Mix the sauce together. This is the sauce I grew up eating and I LOVE it but it is slightly different tasting than store bought pizza sauce. If you wan, you can but your own sauce. 
 
Finishing directions

after letting the dough rest for 10 min, break it into ten small balls. Roll them out thin (on a lightly floured surface), but not so thin you would get a hole if you plan to make the pockets. Put down enough sauce to cover the middle (little less than a Tbs in my experience.) Sprinkle with mozzarella and top with turkey pepperoni. If you are making the pockets, fold the pizza over and crimp the open edges with a fork. Place on lightly floured baking sheets. sprinkle some oregano and garlic powder on top (not too much!) Let it rise for about 30 min, then put it in the oven at 400F for 20-30 min or until golden brown. 

mine came out to 150 calories each.
