	<TEXT> Play at least 3 national tours with my band. Already got the first locked in for Feb. Now just gotta sort 2 more 

Edit. Wow thanks guys. [Here's](http://keggin.bandcamp.com) a link to our stuff! It's Australian punk rock mainly about boxed wine (which we refer to as Goon. Of which Fruity Lexia is a sub brand). Kinda hard to explain but its super cheap here so connects really well with the punk community.

We also play a select amount of songs about beer, jack daniels, tequila and Smirnoff. But they won't live in the studio format until next year possibly! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a big drinker so I can pretty much only recommend pubs. There's some good wineries out the north site of Moama. One I recommend is Silverfox, they do Port and Wine and age it in Brandy Barrels, Google is saying it's permanently closed but it might be worth trying to give em a ring. If you wanna try some local wines, my parents operate a Wine Tavern in Rochester (about a 25 minute drive back towards Melbourne from Echuca) but that's just a good local plug.  </TEXT>
