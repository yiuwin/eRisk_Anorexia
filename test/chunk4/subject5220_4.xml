	<TEXT> A lot of Asimov's early short stories were based around a similar concept: Multivac; a central computer that everyone had access too via dumb terminals in all communities, and which could answer (almost) any question). This theme doesn't ring a bell, so possibly not a Multivac tale, but something that you may want to look up too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, Lagavulin 16, tis one on my very favourites! After buying 5 bottles of the 12yo Distillers edition (2008-2012), I've decided I don't like them (far too sweet compared to the lower ABV 16yo). For shame. 

Still, will probably sell 'em and get more of the 16 - better to have something nice to drink than something that looks nice on the shelf.

	<TEXT> Some of my favourite books are based in a single universe; Iain M Bank's Culture series being one; if you read one book in a series and enjoy it, you've got a good idea about the flavour of the other books in the series - I've a pretty good idea I'm going to enjoy his next book in a culture setting. That's a bonus. 

That said, I'm not averse to books in a one-off setting. Short stories are a great example of this; they're designed to be snappy, without giving the author the requirement of setting up a complex backstory. One of my all time favourite short stories is Peaches for Mad Molly by Steven Gould; a dystopian, cyberpunkesque affair, only 20 or so pages long, but a city\environment unlike any other I've come across. Love it, and am happy for it to exist on its own with no followup, further explanation or expansion.

	<TEXT> A colleague of mine (an ergonomist) was fond of telling people that "Moving from one unergonomic position to another unergonomic position does no harm", meaning that you can sit in a position that may cause harm if you were static for many hours, but for short periods of time did no real harm. 

He was prompted to mention this to me by by continual changing of positions at work; one leg underneath me, crouched on my chair etc, but regularly changing.

	<TEXT> My wife was in a coma. After several months of this, one of her doctors approached me and said, "you know, there have been some recent studies that have shown that oral sex can help revive somebody if a coma" and suggested I might try it with my wife. He was good enough to arrange a quiet time when I could visit uninterrupted to try out this unorthodox approach. So I went along as usual, and feeling somewhat uneasy, I went along with his advice. Seconds later, alarms started going off, my wife's ecg went off the scale, and the doctor who gave the advice sprinted through the door. "what did you do?!" he gasped, "oral sex, doc, just like you suggested. She must have choked" I replied </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple of years ago now, but...took my bank to court for all the charges they'd applied over a period of 6 years (the statutory time limit that I could pursue charges within). I'd been in debt anyway, and having regular charges applied to my account did me no good. 

Ended up getting all my charges back, plus interest at around 28% (What they charged me for unauthorised overdrafts at the time). Total amount: 4500

The cheque originally came with a proviso that I never discuss the settlement, so I rejected it. They then sent it back, unconditionally. 

Paid it in to my account at the same bank the next day :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Main benefit it, I can have sex without worrying about paraphimosis, which is where a tight foreskin can retract, and get stuck behind the glans. It's frakkin' nasty - google if you want to. 

Sensation wise, intercourse is better purely for the lack of constant worry on my part. Had to be so careful before the op - asking my partner to take it ridiculously slowly etc. 

bear in mind I had it for purely medical reasons though, so I didn't really see an alternative. Or rather, I tried a few alternatives and they didn't work. 

Op really was that simple, for me - cut, clean, heal and use about sums it up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, funny you should mention that...I found out the hard way. 

Thoroughly advise several weeks abstinence after having the op. No lasting damage, but feeling a warm sensation, looking down and seeing your johnson oozing blood, is somewhat surprising, in a bad way. No pain, strangely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I won't lie that I was very apprehensive about it. Mainly because after having so little contact, my glans was super sensitive - touching it when washing was painful. 

However, the operation was fine. I was under general anaesthetic, though the op was probably less than half an hour. After the op, the surgeon had used some numbing gel, so I was still numb around 5 hours later after waking up - virtually no sensation down there in that time. 

As sensation came back, there was a bit of pain, but it was the more distant pain of a bruise, rather then anything else. The worst part though was being woken up in the night by my stupid body getting boners. Getting boners while you have stitches in the end of your cock are an unpleasant way of waking up. However, as soon you wake, the pain makes the boner disappear. Off back to sleep. Rinse and repeat for a few nights. 

Definitely glad I did it, and it was far easier getting over it than I was expecting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Visiting the hospital for [phimosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis) (nsfw) as a kid, probably around 10. Lying on a hospital couch, trousers round my ankles, doc, after liberally coating me with anaesthetic gel and then trying to (unsuccessfully) retract my foreskin. All the while, a nurse is standing to one side, holding my hand, any my mum is in the room too. 

As it didn't work anyway, I ended up going for circumcision about 10 years later, after trying various other ways of 'fixing it'. 

About 5 years ago, went along to the sexual health clinic for a free checkup as I'd just started getting into a relationship I wanted to go somewhere, so thought I'd get myself the once over. Lying on a couch, two young nurses come in, take a few swabs, then jam a cotton bud down my penis. Sounds embarrasing, but I ended up having a chat with them whilst this was going on, as if we were just passing the time of day. Quite weird. 

Also ended up having a joke and a laugh with the anaesthetist, doctor and attending nurses whilst waiting in theater to be knocked out prior to my circumcision.  </TEXT>
