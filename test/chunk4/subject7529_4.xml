	<TEXT> Dont worry about chaos resist unless you are energy shield based, there aren't many enemies with chaos damage and its harder to get than elemental resists, so its not worth investing on It.

Elemental resists should come from Gear, and the tree should be focuses on getting lifeevasin (in your case)damage

Also remember that the 62% chance to evade is the OVERALL chance to evade taking into account every single enemy you have faced, this means that against normal mobs you will have like 64% chance (because they are the most common source of damage) and can be much lower against bosses or specific enemies with high accuracy, and by much I mean 20% or even lower in some extreme cases </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, welcome exile, If you need a friendly hand during your trip through the cursed land of Wraeclast you can always come here and join us in jolly exiled cooperation

I dont play bow characters at all, so I could be wrong at something, ANYWAYS:

1-Your first character is 95% sure to NOT be endgame-viable, most people dont prioritice defense as much as they should, both in Gear and in the tree, yours seems a typical glass cannon first character which will fell off pretty hard in the endgame. Dont worry too much about It, its completely normal, no, in fact, beneficial, so that you understand the value of defense.

For starters you should aim for 300 life at the end of each act, 300 at the end of act 1, 1200 at the end of act 4, 1500 at the end of act 1 cruel, and so on, and always cap your resists for the 4th act. Or you can try your character. First levels will be fine, but you will probably hit a wall around lv 60-70.

2-Multi-layered defenses are really good in this game, leech works fine with high dps characters as yours. The only problem being that its imposible to leech damage over time, so all the bleeds and poisons won't help you regain health.

3-It heavily depends on your budget, for a first build you wont have any, so aim for 3-4, when you start being able to afford decent Gear try to get 6-8. But that will come with future characters.

4-Blade vortex requieres you to be in melee range, which is certainly not advisable with this build, as for ethereal knives I have no fucking idea, I'd say bladefall is better but dont mark me on this one. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Game theory IS WILBUR SANS? (Spoilers from Darkest Dungeon and Undertale) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-24 09:01:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We know that Sans has a hidden machine in snowdin, some of his quites and his weird powers suggest that he may come from another dimension. The truth is that Wilbur knew the truth about the Heart of Darkness and he used its otherwordly powers to travel to another dimension with his brother Papyrus.

Then who is papyrus?, you will ask, well, obviously he is the Swine King, only that the dimension travel had unexpected side effects on him and his brother, this explains the Obsession papyrus has to enter in the Royal guard, because a long time ago he was a sovereign.

The warrens also resemble the Undergroud, implying they travelled to a dimmension similar to theirs, which is furtherly enhanced by a weird fact, both dimensiones exist only in cycles, in DD each new heir calls the next one to the manor, and in UT determination created New timelines.

This ALSO explains the Nature of W.D Gaster, he is the Ancestor guys, he "created" Sans and Papyrus (Wilbur and Swine King), he is fussed with the Hearth of Darkness which makes him be everywhere at the same time, also, the riverpersons quote "beware the man who speaks in hands" is obviously a reference to the Ancestor, as he wrote the letter that makes you come to the manor (writing is speaking in hands) and he is initially the narrator of your adventure, only to show up as part of the final boss.

The weird powers of Sans then come from his pact with the Hearth of Darkness.

But wait, how could It Be that we dont see the Hearth of Darkness in Undertale? Well, the thing is... We do. The hearth of Darkness is the true power source of The Core. Think about It, It is buried Deep in the hearth and was "created" by Gaster (the Ancestor) who was also "killed" by It, just like the Ancestor.

And last, but certainly not least, which attack can hit both Wilbur and the Swine King during the Battle? EXACTLY, ceiling SPAGUETTI!

But remember, its just a theory, a GAME theory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First timer, the game is a blast, bla bla bla...

I recently beat the hydra, I used the stairs in the lake to reach the other side of the big locked door in the Darkroot Forest but the Knight/mage duo in there wrecked me, so I guess I'll go there later.

Now im trying to beat the Butterfly, which I guess is guarding the second Bell. I'm using a spear/shield for reference. The problem is that im uncapable of dodging/blocking that attack where he bonbards you with a big magic sphere, whenever I have almost defeated him he starts spamming that attack and I ran out of estus.

I dont care if this isn't "where im supposed to go" or the second Bell is in another place, I just want to beat this guy.

So, how do I Dodge that attack? Do I need to roll towards him? Is there a Magic shield/ring I can use to block It? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been slowly (very) making by way through the game. Playing the prepare to die PS3 edition. In 20 hours I have beaten the Gargoleys (Praise the Sun suckers), the Hydra in Darkroot Bassin, made my way to the Lunar Fly or whatever, which will get his ass served soon, discovered the Dragon Valley,  Ruins of New Londo and found a key to the Undead Asylum (so I guess I can return, somehow).

Also I killed the guy in the firelink shrine who laughs at you and the creepy golden guy staring at the firekeeper.

I got invaded 3 times, the first 2 being sunbros who dropped some humanity, Praises the Sun and returned to their own business, and the 3rd one being a mage that was kicking my ass before he dropped to the void and died miserably.

The game is absolutely amazing and I'm loving every pixel of it.

I'd like to know, with the least amount of spoilers posible, if there is something that I MUST know before advancing. Like... Is there a point of no return? Is there a level or time cap to some areas? Its simply that I want to enjoy the game as much as possible and want to do all the content If possible.

Also, is there something I need to know about multiplayer? Like some sort of code that most players follow for honor? Things like not abusing the enviroment or not backstabbing? </TEXT>

-Mid game based meta, everyone wants to get some Power spike and abuse the advantage. Morde is insanely powerful when he gets rylai's+Hextech gunblade

-Low cc teams(for competitive scene), Morde gets hard countered by cc.

-Ghosts are easier to get If your team coordinates. </TEXT>

Also, a cinematic narrative... Metroid Other M tried that and... Well you know how It ended. BUT, we also have Metroid Fussion who uses a similar estructure and then breaks it by making you navigate the station freely. And also, without such a controlled progresin the SA-X, who is for me the best villain in the series (screw Ridley) couldn't have been half as effective.

	<TEXT> I really think that the game itself is the reasons why this subreddit is so amazing.

We all have our stories of that one run where you forgot torches and met a not-so-friendly neighbourhood shambler, or god forbid, killed Wilbur. And coming here and sharing them, only to find out that almost everyone had a similar experience makes the game feel a lot deeper.

It may be that all those hours crawling in the depths of the abyss make us aprecciate more the bright moments; a silly joke told in the campfire or a mercenary turned into a hero in the face of desperation.

Thank you Redhook, and thank you too guys.

	<TEXT> Hi! So first thing I only play Mordekaiser in Top and Bot, so I may be wrong on something:

-Morde jungle is playable if you know what you are doing and you run into a favourable team comp. As you said, he is quite similar to Graves, only that he suffers even more from lack of cc in his team, as he doesn't have the same movility as Graves.

-For jungle mordekaiser I'd definitely pick stormraiders unless you are going for some yolo full ap build, luden procs+liandrys+DFT add up for some insane dot. If you are more conservative pick Stormraiders which makes your ganking actually reliable (kinda), TLD is a big nono for me.

-I can see ghost working in certain matchups, but generally flash for 3rd q+flash *bonks*

-The best thing I can tell you here is to experiment, take whatever you feel confortable with. If you want especific builds you have burnkaiser, which uses DFT+ lyandris+luden procs (jungle item will do) + full ap to oneshot adcs (if you're fed enough), if I recall correctly Mordehuezer experimented with some weird full tank jungle Mordekaiser and was quite succesfull with it, ask him if you are interested. Also rylays is always a good item on Mord.

-He suffers a lot again control mages, but with the assasin meta (which he is good against) he is kinda okeyish in midlane. Best advice would be to push like there is no tomorrow then doing chickens, if you have some ap and do it correctly you heal in doing so and get some nice gold/exp. At least this is what I do when I somehow play him mid, then I procede to use the gold advantage + zoning to get some dragon ghost and snowball the game from there.

-I don't buy any skins, but if I had to get one for Morde it'd definitely be king of clubs, just to get rid of the pizza feet.

-You remember correctly, not 100% sure but I think it was: lv 1 w if you have leash, q if not, lv 2 q/w, then max e for insane clearspeed.

-Just a last thing, Mordekaiser has a toxic relationship with snowballing, he is very weak when behind, but if you get a lead you HAVE to push on and make the game a constant feast of kills and objectives. If the game slows down you will probably get outscaled and loose. </TEXT>
