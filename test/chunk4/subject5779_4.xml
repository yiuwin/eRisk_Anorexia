	<TEXT> CPython is a runtime written in C. Clojure uses JVM GC. Should I choose Rust for my programming language with GC and threading? Did anybody make a  implementation of a GCed language in Rust? Is there a GC implementation itself which I can plug in? 

I am leaning towards Java but I want the perfect excuse to choose Rust.

E: Its an dynamically typed, interpreted language. Interpreter works on the AST rather than make bytecode. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to make a runtime and have a REPL. So I have to implement a GC too, right?

The HTTP server thing was a distraction. I wanted to reuse the host standard library instead of building one from scratch. </TEXT>
