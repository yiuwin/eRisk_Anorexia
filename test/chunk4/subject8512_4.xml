I however require a small starting fee as a security payment for lost work time if the game doesn't get greenlit. Depending on the amount of work that fee would be between 50-100$ 
If that's okay with you I can send you some of my previous work! </TEXT>

And thank you for the compliment but there are no chimes in it! You maybe meant the high notes at the piano? Or something else? :)

The basic chords are:
Dm, Dm, C, F, Bb, C, Bb, C and so on for the main part
If I remember correctly I think the "other" part (without listening to it, Iv'e played this before) is Bb, A, forwards and backwards :)
It's called Gratia Mundi btw (i think)

EDIT: no, the "other part" is probably Bb, and F forwards and backwards :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I followed IGN's video ["How to Make Final Fantasy XV's Food In Real Life"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X32v5_psqEA ab_channel=IGN) and came up with [this](http://imgur.com/a/tPpes)
It was actually really tasty!

I definitely recommend making this to get in the "FF mood" and if someone would want me to write a guide to make the video easier to follow, just comment!

(Stupid me forgot to add the parmesan on top in the end, but it still tasted good!)

Enjoy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, in my experience, especially with Apple Music it's hard to control your prices. They usually decide how much the music they sell go for. 
But anyway
I didn't get if you did this or not, but it's totally illegal to distribute any music, free or commercial, with any samples from any other track without that tracks creators explicit consent. 
Good luck!

	<TEXT> Yeah. Idk how to make the world better, just how I wish it should be. :)
I think the best way to fix the world is trough education though. Instead of having ridiculous laws telling people what they can do and not, it's better to give them enough sense to make valid life choices themselves. With better education in America I think anti gun laws will be put up and respected within a few generations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats just stupid. 
The main way people get seriously hurt is by guns (I guess, I have no real idea, could be wrong, please enlighten me). To bare arms to protect yourself from other with arms makes somewhat sense, but because the one that would want to hurt someone, always would shoot first, in the end we are going to en up with more hurt people than if no one had guns.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm So hyped for FFXV! I love FF over all and XV seems like one of the better games in the series so far! The problem is that the only current gen console I have is the Wii U. So I'm not going to be able to play it for many years (not gonna buy a PS4 for more than 100$ just for FFXV, I game on PC and nintendo, but next gen maybe...)

I just wanted to express my exhilaration and at the same time melancholy for only being able to watch youtubers play the game, but that I'm very thankful for!
Thank you Reddit for being a place for me to dumb some feelings!
Have a nice day! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My top 10 in a not very "top ten" order but in somewhat of an order anyway. 

10. (Not currently listening) Welcome to Night Vale. Google it. 

9. (Not currently airing) Serial! Needs no explination! Excellent and interesting!

8. (Not currently airing) Rambling with Sips. My favourite podcast of all time, maybe on the same place as the YogPod, but is sadly not currently airing. The triforce podcast is almost the same thing though so Yay!

7. No Such Thing As a Fish, a podcast by the "QI elves" about lot's of cool random facts!

6. Piano Puzzler, every week Bruce Adolph rewrites a well known tune in to a style of a classical composer. Very interesting for music and or piano enthusiasts!

5. Dekonstruktiv Kritik, a swedish, kind of political, almost, hmmm, can't describe it: podcast. 

4. IGN Podcasts including: IGN GameScoop, IGN NVC, IGN Beyond, IGN Unlocked, IGN Unfiltered and some others that I don't listen to! Perfect newsfeed and bus-ride distraction for the gamer!

3. IGN Sveriges podcast, Swedens very own ign podcast!

2. TSKNAS: "Till slut kommer ngon att skratta" A Swedish podcast with three brilliant stand up comedians (I've made 2 of the jingles they are using)

1. The YogPod! Currently hosting "The Triforce Podcast" with Lewis, Sips and PyrionFlax! They always crack me up and make my day better! The Bodega story is exhilarating and I die a little every week when I have to wait for a new episode! </TEXT>
