	<TEXT> I hate the comment, where will I get my protein from?

What about all the other essential vitamins? B12, Vitamin A, B, C, folic acid, calcium, iron and zinc? 

They each play an important role in the body but as we are all Neanderthal hunter gatherers protein is the main concern.. Wrong! 

Going vegan is a step which takes time, you don't just know which food you like to eat, or what you can eat. It's a process which is so fun!  </TEXT>

How was the map? I loved the first few minutes of 3v3 getting the resource pads, towers etc. Is this still a vital part of 3v3s?

	<TEXT> 1) Heard about it, but not overly interested in the idea!
2) I'd probably try it out of curiosity but after not touching it for many years I'm not bothered about it.
3) It's still going to be unhealthy and it's still going to be effecting the environment. 

Like people have said, people who are trying to push this lab grown meat do think vegans will try it. I'm trying not to speak for the majority here but I think we know what's good and bad for us and after we've all left it behind us, we're feeling healthier and living a guilt free life. I'd probably try it and then stay on my plant based diet. 

Still, interesting stuff! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm no expert but to create one you need some sort of system how you define word order, how to show cases and tenses, do nouns have personal pronouns etc. 

I'd suggest doing some reading on how modern day languages are based on older languages like Latin or Sanskrit and see how they changed and get some ideas! 

Good luck on your language endeavour.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me and my girlfriend were in the west of Canada going through Bannf and Jasper and we were going to a place called the ink plots, takes about 1/2 hours to walk to this place, so..

We were walking on this rough path through the woods and there was a couple walking towards us about 15 metres away. We heard what we thought was a bear yawn, both couples froze, both looked at one another like we need to move quick. 

Heard the noise again, turns out it was a tree rubbing against another tree. We both laughed and just carried on walking.. 

For a few brief seconds both couples were thinking about running! </TEXT>
