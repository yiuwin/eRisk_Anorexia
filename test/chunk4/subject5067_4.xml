	<TEXT> What kind if experiences have you had with any authorities that caught you and what happened after you got caught? 

Please share any experiences because I'm super fucking scared of getting caught and that kinda limits my climbs/exploring, the thing is that I simply don't know and i've been asking and googling but have found pretty much nothing. As a student I don't have too much money to pay fines or anything and criminal record surely isn't a thing i want 

Oh and i live in Finland so if anyone happens to know what happens here if you get caught please share that too. I'll probably end up going to a police station and asking if I'm ever walking by or something just to be sure lol

Ps. I obviosly don't vandalize or cause any harm to anything while exploring

Edit: 'Ill end up asking a police station', not just going into there for no reason

	<TEXT> Yeah, but most junglers need to realise that pressuring a lane doesn't only mean ganking. Clearing wards for example is a thing most junglers dont do enough (plat 2 eu so obviously im still pretty bad and  in a pretty low elo). But yeah, i completely agree. If you get to choose between going top and facing a 3/1 darius who's sitting at full hp when your riven is 1/3 and has 50% hp, or going bot and possibly getting your adc few kills AND a dragon, not hard to choose.

But junglers, please try to help losing lane as much as you can without risking making the lane lose even harder. Rift herald, pinks, pressure, not pushing the lane every time for some minor turret damage over letting your laner get the extra 10 last hits without getting poked etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been testing the new assasins one the pbe (mainly kha since I just love the changes) so i've mainly played jungle. 
And no, unlike pretty much everyone here i don't think the plants are that big of a problem, now, this is coming from a pretty bad player (plat 2 eu atm) so obviously my opinion will be different compared to the good players, but imho the plants are really good idea, clearing/defending the right plants can turn a fight around, and it takes skill. The only problem i have with plants is that they seem like a replacement for the smite buffs, which i really like.

That being said I do and can see why people would feel the way they do, but im just afraid a lot of people are only complaining because it's something different and new, rather than actually bad (obviously you right there might not be doing this. 'Lot of' doesnt mean everyone) 

The plants are a new objective and they open some really cool and new opportunities for example, if you play a jungler that has a pretty bad clear and tends to lose a lot of hp during his first clears the healing plants (i really dont know the proper names) can really help you, but if the enemy jungler is smart enough to ward them/get scuttle early that can lead to several very easy first bloods (as i've seen)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah so, the first ever climb i did was a crane so it feels kinda silly that some buildings feel 'too high' (I live in Finland so the buildings aren't even 2/3 of the crane's height). But yeah, I'm just not comfortable with straight ladders and im just wondering if i should just climb a tall building to get rid of the feeling or go little by little. 
Also, what do you guys consider ''Too high''? And how do you deal with those buildings? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I'd love to climb buildings but most here in Finland are either impossible to climb due to area alarms which basically triggers before you get to the building or its just way too dangerous (I'm willing to take a little risk but having to actually risk my life at a 20-80 % is a bit too much)

So yeah, I've climbed one crane but several roofs, idk, i just prefer roofs they're a lot more interesting. Still ladders which is boring but hey, keeps me entertained :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, my grandmother owns (after my grandfather died) this decent sized ''farm'' i could say, its old so they don't have any animals there or anything anymore, the thing is that i keep dreaming about this place, which i occasionally visit, and every single time thus far, the dream has turned into a nightmare. It has to mean something, I've also kept seeing dreams about my dads place which also turn into nightmares, and my own house (which my mom owns, im 17 atm) which, yep, you guessed it, turn into nightmares. So, many of you probably think that something abusive etc. happened, but that's not the case at all, only bad thing that ever happened was that my dad has an alcohol problem (wont go into details because i dont think that's needed) but nothing ever happened to me that traumatized me, so why do i keep seeing these weird dreams? Also, the dream usually starts with me being in one of these places doing something, and then i just get this weird insanely bad feeling of insecurity and something (never really seen it before until last night) chases me or tries to invade the house etc. And yeah, the guy who i last night saw, was (okay. I already know the description of the thing will be shit, but that's the best i can do) Completely black figure, kinda like a shadow, that had fairly long pointy hair and i could sense death. Also in that same dream my grandfather woke up (woke up from sleep, even tho we all in the dream knew that he's dead) and bunch of other random shit happened. Does anyone know what's the problem here? By reading what i just wrote it seems like i'll be seeing my school psychiatrist soon, lol. 

Sorry for long post and if anyone knows anything, thanks =).

Ps. Feel free to ask any questions that help with further analyzing of these dreams, 100% willing to help anyone who's willing to help me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Group ironmen? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-02 16:20:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Got this idea waay back when ironmen were first released. 

What if instead of being ironman or ultimate ironman you could choose a third option 'Group ironman', the players you'd group up with would have to be on tutorial island standing next to you to join the group.

It would simply be a group of ironmen that could boss together and still receive the drops and trad each others, but still wouldnt be able to use the GE or trade other players 

I'm not even sure if its possible to make the game know whether or not the other player damaging the boss is somehow grouped with you so you will receive the drop, but i'd simply like to know what other people think about this, thanks.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ''New'' boss idea. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-20 20:51:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yea so this might've been suggested couple of times but I just felt like asking what people think.

So after hearing about the raids (that are maybe coming to osrs?)  I started thinking about a boss that would pretty much be unbeatable, but it would have stages where people would get the opportunity to be rewarded and leave the dungeon/place (or any other thing the fight takes place in).

So let's say the boss would have 5 stages for example. First one could be like some level 150 guards that are pretty easy and simple to kill, would require nothing but some tanks and so on.

Second one would involve some mechanics that you'd need to know to beat the monster. For example 2 level 300 monsters that when close to each others heal passively

Third stage would start to get harder, and it would require your team to be  coordinated and have some non-combat stats. For example the boss has nest that keeps spawning some small minions, you need to cut a tree and then burn the nest with the logs you get, or something like that.

Fourth stage would be the last monsters between the boss. For example 2 jad-like bosses that constantly (while alive) spawn minions that attack with melee, range or mage, while the 2 bosses hit you with slow attacks that you need to pray flick or else you get dealt massive damage (80+). The ground would also turn into water/lava/poison so you couldn't keep hitting the bosses all the time if you were only using melee.

And the fifth stage would be the boss itself, so pretty much like level 1000 boss that has one shot mechanic, poison, venom, all attack styles, minions and healing, and would also require 90+ non combat stats to kill. 

Now just keep in mind that these are just examples so that you guys understand the idea, the stages could be completely different and there could be way more or less of them. Just the basic idea. 
Also, the minions/bosses wouldn't drop anything but occasionally some food/brews/restores. After every stage people would find a teleport that teleports them to the start and a chest. The chest could have thieving level requirement or something like that. 


I just want to hear what people think of this, please leave your opinions below. Thanks =). </TEXT>

Why does shit like this happen? Why is there every week something bad happening? What happened to this community? I mean, I know it's never been perfect.. But i also know it hasn't been like this. I miss the times when reddit would be filled with cool ideas and the comments on those posts would be about the idea (yes, I know there still are some and I'm really happy to read those). Just seems like now its hate hate hate.. And no, I'm not bitching, but I can't say that I don't care either since I really do. What's happening? 

Also just want to point out that this post is not about the video, it's about the ''topic?'' I know you're all smart enough to understand but the last thing I'm trying to achieve is hate lol 

commentsupvotes please I don't want to see this be popular i just want an explanation.

Thanks and have fun scaping =)

EDIT: ITS NOT ABOUT WHETHER HE SCAMMED IT OR NOT. It's about stuff like oakdice vs them drama and emily drama etc. popping out all the time, this is not attack against mote or jacob or oakdice OR the guy that made the video, I don't know what happened, im not smart enough to talk about that so i wont. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because scamming irl is different, people have actually done something for their belongings and not just sat in front of a pc spending time. You could also physically ruin someones life by scamming them, and I'm completely willing to make someone rebuild if they're dumb enough to get scammed, but im not willing to make someone literally start a new life simply because i just felt like taking their bank account, money etc. And yes, im selfish. No fucking shit? If i have 60m in runescape i keep it to myself not because i think i worked hard for it but because i want to spend it and care more about me having fun than someone else having fun. Sure if i make some nats for 30 hours i can also feel as if i deserve it more but thats sorta rare.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Smurfing, interesting concept. Yes. I'm all for smurfing, but hear me out. So i used to be global elite in csgo (highest rank, not trying to brag i have a point just wait.) from time to time i'd get on my friends account and just have fun there, if i was drinking or had lower rank friends to play with. I won the games single handedly EXTREMELY rarely, like once or twice, and always had intention of having fun and not ruining the game for anyone. This is my concept of smurfing, this is what i think when i hear the word smurfing.

And again, i need to say that smurfing isnt comparable to scamming. It should be common sense to use your common sense, if someone tells you to give your stuff to them, why the fuck would you. Just explain me, give me one reason why you would trust a random person, not only in games (since you keep comparing them im just gonna do it too and be hypocritical yay me) but in real life too. There is no reason, no possible explanation, you're intentionally taking a risk when you do that, just dont take the risk. 
People who go against smurfs, on the other hand, have nothing they can do, it's their muscle memory and knowledge of the game, not common sense, that's stopping them from performing as well as the opponent is.

Also, let me just clear something out. I don't agree with people being assholes, i just dont think the scammers are being assholes and if you say that the people who scam do it because they cant or something, where are you statistics, where's your proof. I seriously doubt people scam because they cant scam irl ?

	<TEXT> So you're saying, that if i play a game and simply think it's entertaining to try to trick people im an asshole? Do you see how this makes no fucking sense :D? 
'' killing in games to real life, yeah, thats why we have games, so that we can create a world in which you can kill. pvp is also an activity that people can willingly chose to engage in. people have full awareness of what they are doing'' 
Im pretty sure runescape pvp wasn't made so people can experience killing others, but to test which one is better. 
Also, i feel like you're not really arguing about scamming being allowed or not, you're arguing about whether we should be nice online or not. Also, there is no way. Literally, no way that someone can scam you if you're smart enough, if you just mind your own business. No1's gonna ruin the game for you if you're cautious enough. I just don't know how to else explain it, it's not something you can just go ahead and do no matter what the other guy does, it's something so insanely easily  preventable that i don't see a reason for it to be 'illegal'. 

Do you also think that bad CoD or CS:GO players should be allowed to kill just as many opponents as the good players, because you know, if the other guy is better and takes advantage of it it's kinda unfair! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, so, i never said you're not eligible for the same customer support, all i said was that it makes sense that the streamer gets it faster. 
'Please help me understand my faults' Wait what? What faults? What the fuck are you on about lmao? Who said you did anything wrong?

Why do people comment without reading the messages they comment about? If there's something that you need me to explain feel free to quote me so i understand.
