	<TEXT> I'm so sorry you're feeling this way- it truly is the worst feeling. I am struggling with it a lot lately as well, but I have found going to therapy has helped tremendously with baby steps. Its good to have someone "talk you down" or bring you back into reality of what you truly look like. Hope this comment helps- message me if you'd like!  </TEXT>
