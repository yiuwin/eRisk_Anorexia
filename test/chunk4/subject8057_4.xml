	<TEXT> Drug testing is imperfect, but it doesn't really matter; from the company's liability standpoint, it is better than nothing. As long as the company can show it took reasonable care in avoiding having a high or drunk forklift operator running people over, it can avoid being held soley liable if their worker's comp insurance company hangs them out to dry after someone using drugs has an accident.

Generally speaking, if you operate heavy equipment as part of your job, there will be some sort of standing agreement in place that if you fail a drug test, you will be fired. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I literally used a direct metric for criminal behavior. How is that "strawmen piles" or "goalpost shifting"?

The question was whether or not corruption increased with increasing amounts of money.

I pointed out that available data of empirical measurements of corruption (crime rates) does not support that conclusion.

How else are you planning on measuring it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Poverty should be an absolute measure. The 60% of median income metric is a measure of inequality, not poverty.

The US's poverty line is above the median income of most countries.

This is why people make a distinction between absolute and relative poverty, as well as poverty and "extreme poverty".

A measure which simply measure the standard deviation of your population is worthless for telling whether or not there are more or less "poor people". Indeed, by that metric, if your entire population doubles its income, you won't see any decrease in poverty at all, which is clearly nonsense. </TEXT>

Moreover, law is mostly designed to not be too subjective.

On top of that, you're just flat-out being disingenuous. The bad part of town is where poor people live. Crime maps show that crimes are committed much more often around where poor people are. Poor people are much more likely to be victims of crime because they are around people who are much more likely to be perpetrators of crime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Forklifts are like, one of the defining pieces of dangerous heavy equipment. If you get a DUI, no one will hire you to operate a forklift. Likewise, drug testing is likely.

It's for liability reasons; if you run someone over in a forklift, they're going to die. If you hit someone with a forklift, there's a good chance of serious injury. If you tip over a forklift, it is likely to cause serious damage and serious injury is all too likely.

Places that have forklifts generally have insurance, and that insurance may well require such things, and insurance payouts might be denied on the basis of "The accident was caused by drug use." As such, it is very important to the company to avoid liability in such cases. And the best way to do that is to simply not employ anyone who fails a drug test as a forklift operator.

Weed is the #2 drug-related cause of fatal accidents, second only to alcohol.

If you do something like fly a plane, drive a train, or operate a forklift, your workplace is likely to be a Nazi about drug testing for liability reasons, because they don't want to be on the hook for any damage caused as a result of someone being on drugs at work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The original topic was "does money make people corrupt?"

The answer is no.

This is one line of evidence as to why - black people tend to be poorer than white people, and also are more likely to commit crimes.

Ergo, this is evidence against the premise that greater wealth leads to higher crime rates, because members of a group which are generally poorer have higher crime rates, not lower ones. And thus, this is evidence against the idea that money makes people more corrupt.

This isn't a dog whistle. It is a statistical argument based on correlations within a population.

Poor people are also [more likely to be victims of crime.](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail iid=5137) This is also well-known.

This is because people tend to target people around them for criminal activity; thus, poor people (who live amongst other poor people) are more likely to become crime victims because poor people commit crime at a higher rate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Which is endogenous - whether something is charged as a particular crime is up to the prosecutor.

What *evidence* do you have for prosecutors being racist?

Do you have *evidence* that this effect is *sufficient* to explain the vast gulfs?

Moreover, it should be remembered that manslaughter itself carries a hefty sentence, and that the homicide rate amongst whites is much lower than it is amongst blacks. You cannot blame this all on prosecutors, because we have empirical measures of crime reporting which line up with the arrest stats from the NCVS (National Crime Victimization Survey).

 There are strong correlates between both race and income on the SAT's. There is some work done to suggest that there are racial bias in how the test is constructed - there was a whole debacle about the word 'regatta' and the vocabulary portion of the SAT.

Nah. The idea that the test is racist is, I'm afraid, pure bullshit which is not taken seriously by any specialist in the field. As it turns out, *all* g-loaded tests show a large gulf between blacks and whites, because of the large black-white IQ gap. This is [scientifically uncontroversial](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf).

Moreover, the whole regatta thing was pure bullshit from stupid people. The reality is that the question, like many SAT questions, is actually a measure of reasoning.

 RUNNER: MARATHON ::

 A) envoy: embassy

 B) martyr: massacre

 C) oarsman: regatta

 D) referee: tournament

 E) horse: stable

This was intended to be a hard question. While some people might know what a regatta is, it isn't actually important to correctly answering the question.

The reason is pretty simple: what does a runner do?

A runner runs in a marathon. But nothing else can use that analogy - none of the others involve running.

It cannot be super general - horses live in stables, referees oversee tournaments, martyrs are killed in massacres, and envoys work in embassies. They're all clearly related.

So we have to go more general - a runner competes in a marathon.

We can immediately eliminate horses, envoys, and martyrs - they're all too unrelated. This leaves us with oarsmen and regattas (whatever a regatta is) and referees and tournaments.

The problem is, referees don't compete in tournaments - they officiate them. This is closer to envoy::embassy (envoys work in embassies, referees work in tournaments) than it is to runner::marathon, so it must be wrong.

So by process of deduction, that leaves us with oarsmen :: regatta.

We don't need to know what a regatta is to know it is the right answer because we can determine pretty confidently that all the other answers are wrong.

I had no idea what a regatta when I first saw the question, but it was immediately obvious to me what the correct answer was because all of the other answers had to be wrong.

Of course, I'm also the sort of person who got a near perfect score on the SAT. This isn't coincidental; I understand how this stuff works.

The people who whined... well, didn't.

The reality was that you weren't expected to have a perfect knowledge of 100% of the vocabulary on the test, but you didn't need it. Indeed, part of the test is testing people's ability to determine the meaning of a word from context, which is an important part of literacy in general.

 I'll leave this here: http://www3.amherst.edu/~jwreyes/papers/LeadCrimeBEJEAP.pdf

It is not only bullshit, but obvious bullshit, I'm afraid. I've done quite a bit of research into it, and indeed, have read that very paper before.

As it turns out, the whole thing is obvious nonsense. Lead exposure began to increase before the crime wave started (for example, via lead paint). If lead was the cause, why didn't crime rates go up back when lead exposure began going up after the turn of the century?

Moreover, the time-lag is wrong. Peak crime was in 1994, but peak crime happens at about 18 years of age. Peak lead from gasoline happened around 1970, which would suggest that peak crime should have been sometime in the 1980s - about 18 years after peak lead, if not sooner (depending on exposure patterns).

Additionally, the crime rate increased precipitously in the late 1960s. This is highly problematic, because there's no evidence of a corresponding spike in lead exposure two decades earlier. Indeed, crime spiked up in the late 1960s, then stayed at a relatively constant level from the 1970s to 1990s, with some peaks and troughs but no clear pattern arising from lead exposure.

Worse, it doesn't work out if you look at international figures either - China, again, has very high blood-lead levels due to all the coal burning, but their crime rate is much lower than that of the United States.

Additionally, the levels found in people's blood were far too low to cause such large effects - we're talking maybe an IQ point of difference, if that.

 And finally, a refutation of your original claim. Evidence that higher levels of wealth are linked to lower levels of compassion:

 https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-wealth-reduces-compassion/

First off, my claim was that richer people commit less crime.

Secondly, the reality is that the study cited... doesn't actually show that rich people have less compassion. Sadly, it is fairly typical pseudoscientific shysterism, by measuring proxies and then claiming an effect which is not directly measured by the study. It is, I'm afraid, purely driven by ideology.

If rich people show less compassion than poor people, why are poor people more likely to commit crimes? That's an *empirical* and very direct measure of compassion, and yet, we see that poor people are more likely to commit crimes. </TEXT>

You seem to be confused about what racism is.

These are FBI statistics, a representation of reality. Is it "racist" to say that blacks have a higher poverty rate than whites? No.

It would be racist to say that all black people are poor. It would also be incorrect.

But it is not racist to report on reality.

I'm citing my numbers from the US government. I'm not making this shit up.

The reason why you're calling me a racist is because I just demonstrated that you are wrong, and now you are claiming I am evil, so my argument doesn't count.

Either put up or shut up, but don't just insult me.

FYI, the correlation between poverty and crime occurs across all races; poor white people commit more crimes than rich white people, poor black people commit more crimes than rich black people. A higher percentage of black people are poor than white people. </TEXT>

Fraud, embezzlement, forgery and counterfeiting...

A third of these crimes are committed by blacks according to the FBI.

For reference, blacks make up 12% of the population, indicating that they're disproportionately likely to commit said crimes relative to the general population.

Non-hispanic whites commit about 48% of forgery and counterfeiting offences and somewhat over 50% of fraud and embezzlement offenses (Hispanic whites commit about 16% of forgery and counterfeiting offenses and about 10% of fraud and embezzlement offenses, which is roughly proportional to their fraction of the population).

I'm pretty sure I'm not the one who has the wrong idea about who is most likely to commit these crimes on a per-capita basis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is simple nonsense.

First off, the idea that the 2008 market crash had its roots in criminal behavior is simply false. The proximate cause of the crash was not criminal behavior, it was a housing bubble. While some criminal behavior occurred around the whole thing, the reality is that the proximate cause was not criminal behavior but simple greed - people wanted houses, bankers wanted money. Because it was perceived that housing prices would only go up, bankers felt that loaning money even to sketchy people was valid, because even if the sketchy people defaulted on their mortgages, they could just flip the houses and sell them for a higher price to the next person along the line, or at the very least not lose money. Likewise, the homebuyers figured that prices could only go up, so took out mortgages on houses based on the premise that the value of the houses could only go up, and so overvalued the houses.

When the economy slowed down, people stopped being able to make their mortgage payments. This resulted in people defaulting on their mortgages. This increased the supply of houses on the market. The greater supply of houses caused the value of houses on the market to drop. This caused some houses to drop below the remaining value on people's mortgages, which caused some of those people to walk away from their houses based on the premise that their house was now worth less than their mortgage - i.e. they owed more than their house was worth. This resulted in more houses ending up on the market, further depressing the price of houses.

This caused a sharp crash in the housing market, and because a lot of people had been investing in housing because it was making lots of money and because it was "safe" (as if there is such a thing as a safe investment), a lot of people lost their shirts and some of the people who insured the mortgages failed because (shock and surprise) when the whole mortgage market collapsed they couldn't pay back the insurance on *everyone's* mortgage investments.

While some fraud did occur, most of it was just regular old greed on the part of investors, bankers, and home-buyers. Everyone bought into the idea that housing prices could only go up, and so when they crashed, people got fucked.

The idea that this was all some sort of criminal scheme is obvious nonsense when you look at the fact that a lot of people lost a crapton of money on the market.

While some criminal behavior did occur, a lot of it was wishful thinking. And indeed, part of the reason why few people were prosecuted was because a lot of the very same people who were allegedly committing fraud ended up losing large quantities of money by betting the wrong way on the mortgage market - if they were truly involved in some sort of criminal scheme, why were they invested in the market? Why did they lose so much money?

That's not to say that fraud didn't occur, and that people didn't do illegal things, but a lot of it was genuine human greed.

Blaming it all on illegal activity is pure, sheer nonsense, and the idea that it was a "heist" is, I'm afraid, pretty much pure bullshit. Banks lost a fuckton of money out of the whole thing, and they were the people who had primarily been profiting off of it.

The reality is that people have a poor idea of value. People assume that because the housing market lost a huge amount of value, that money must have gone somewhere. But the reality was that the money never existed in the first place - it was imaginary. It was based on the value of the capital, and when the capital devalued, the alleged money disappeared because it had never really existed in the first place.

Secondly, very few people were actually involved in criminal behavior there - thousands, maybe a few tens of thousands. There are over 8 *million* crimes reported every year in the United States alone.

It doesn't "add a whole new dimension". </TEXT>

The difference is that people who are below average are incapable of evaluating the competence of others, while people who are above average are capable of evaluating the competence of others - the people who are below average are unable to properly evaluate the performance of others and, even after looking at the performance of others, still overrate their own ability. Conversely, competent people will recognize competence in others and will adjust their own evaluation of their own ability upwards, closer to their true ability level, in light of their new knowledge of the competence of others.

Incompetent people tend to overestimate their own competence, while competent people tend to overestimate the competence of others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "The hideous thing about meritocracy is it tells you that if you've given life your all and haven't gotten to the top you're thick or stupid. Previously, at least, you could always just blame the class system."

Once you understand this, apologia like Michelle Alexander's book falls into place.

The reality is that the claim that law enforcement and the criminal justice system are used as a mechanism to keep minorities poor and limit their opportunity for advancement is not actually something which there is much evidence for. It *is* a belief which is desperately clung to by racists like Alexander, because it gives them a reason to hate and a way to externalize blame.

The reality is that systematic studies of the US justice system have failed to bear out the claims of people like Alexander. IRL, we see that blacks are no more likely to be shot than whites in similar situations when faced with law enforcement - the reason why black people are more likely to be shot on a per-capita basis is because blacks are more likely to be in such situations in the first place on a per-capita basis.

Likewise, blacks are sentenced to longer jail terms than whites, but the cause is not racism in sentencing, but rather differences in severity of crime and criminal histories - blacks tend to commit more severe crimes on average (particularly robbery and murder, both of which carry hefty sentences - blacks make up over 50% of robbers and murderers in the US) and are more likely to have a history of criminal behavior.

The cold, dark reality is that when we deal with murders (which are a very empirical measure - corpses are easy to count, and we solve about 60% of murder cases), blacks make up [44% of victims](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2014.xls) and [half of perpetrators](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43). It should also be noted that solution rates of murders in majority-minority areas, such as [in Chicago,](http://heyjackass.com/) are lower, not higher.

Indeed, crime reporting and conviction in majority-minority areas tend to be lower in general because of underreporting and lack of cooperation by witnesses in such areas. This isn't surprising - criminals and relatives of criminals aren't very likely to call the cops, and criminals intimidate non-criminals in such areas. Combined with general dislike of the police (in part because of the perception of being targets), and you get a lower rate of people in such areas being nailed. Thus, it is likely that arrest rates of people in such areas actually *underestimate* the true crime rates in such areas.

 If people don't have access to the same level of education because of state-level school funding models and the reliance on local property taxes in many jurisdictions, there are fewer dual-income households because one parent is in prison or a druggie or can't get a job in the formal economy because of a criminal record, you're going to see more people turning to gangs and the underground economy. I don't think that's evidence of corruption.

The poorest areas of the US tend to be poor rural areas, generally populated by Native Americans and white people, not blacks. Poor urban areas, which have the highest crime rates, tend to be much less poor than these rural areas.

These poor rural areas don't have particularly high crime rates, despite facing even greater difficulties in terms of funding for education. [And indeed, poor rural whites do better than *rich* blacks on tests like the SATs.](http://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html)

The claims of education being the cause are questionable. It is more likely that the [IQ gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence#United_States_test_scores) is to blame.

 There's also evidence that the presence negative environmental factors such as lead and other pollutants are strongly related both to wealth and to future levels of crime.

This is pure and obvious nonsense. Blood-lead levels are vastly higher in China, but they have a much lower crime rate. Indeed, there's no evidence of the link at all; blood-lead levels were high before the American crime wave, and the fall in crime rates did not correlate well with the fall in blood-lead levels.

And to forestall your inevitable but nonsensical claim that rich people are secretly all criminals but are just never prosecuted:

A) Where is the "bad part of town"? Poor areas.

B) If you look at crime rates (as in, the rate of crimes happening, as opposed to prosecutions), you'll find that they are higher in poor areas. Robberies and murders are both much more common in such places, and poor people are both more likely to murder people and are more likely to be murdered. </TEXT>

We would expect rich people to be more criminal than poor people if the statement in the OP (money is power and power corrupts) was true.

 That's the definition of poverty by the government in the U.S. 3x the economy meal plan from 1955 adjusted for inflation. Anyway you cut it that is not a relative measure.

All criminal behavior which involves acting dishonestly in return for money or personal gain is corrupt.

 If you want a hard definiton of a person being a corrupt person, I think that not caring about the well-being of other humans is a good one.

If power corrupted, we should expect powerful people to be less moral than less powerful people.

Given that the original question was "money is power and power corrupts", if this statement was true, we should then see that wealthier people would tend to be worse than poor people.

IRL, we see the opposite - wealthier people tend to be better than poor people, and commit less crime.

Therefore, the idea that "money is power and power corrupts" is probably wrong, or at least, there isn't good evidence for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you even read the article? It specifically notes that the measure is dependent on the consumption rate of the population as a whole, and it is based on before-aid income.

The idea of "adjusted for inflation" is gigantic lie anyway; not only are there multiple inflationary indices, but they overestimate inflation.

---

 I get that, I was characterizing your tangent which was clearly attempting to shift the discussion from the corrupting influence of power, to castigating the poor; a totally unrelated issue.

You asked what the view was on the corrupting influence of power.

I pointed out that the empirical evidence suggests that power does not corrupt, because crime rates are higher amongst the poor than the rich. If power corrupted, we'd expect for rich people to be more criminal than poor people.

This is not "castigating the poor", it is pointing out that evidence suggests that power doesn't corrupt.

In fact, the reality is that the idea that power corrupts actually comes from people without power trying to make up reasons why they are secretly better than people with power; the idea that rich people are evil or corrupt comforts them, as they can then pretend like they are, at least, good people, even though they are poor or powerless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Poor people are vastly more likely to commit crimes, independent of prosecutorial discretion.

A good example of this is murders. Murders are not a matter of prosecutorial discretion - there's a corpse. You know it happened.

Poorer areas have higher homicide rates than richer ones.

Poorer races have a higher homicide rate than richer ones.

Poor black people are by far the most likely demographic to both commit and be victims of murder, but make up less than 5% of the population as a whole.

 A better answer to that question would be to search the literature on regulatory capture and institutional design. Countries with stronger and more trusted institutions tend to be wealthier since there are fewer channels by which kleptocrats can siphon public wealth into their own coffers.

But there's also a correlation between criminality and corruption. More corrupt countries tend to be more criminal, generally speaking. The major exception is socialist countries, which are all corrupt regardless of underlying crime rates.

In other words, the wealthier countries having better institutional design and fewer issues with regulatory capture may be the result of them being less criminal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Violent crime has been declining for decades, while U.S. poverty rates have gone up and down. Can't explain that.

Absolute poverty has been in decline for decades.

You're looking at a measure of relative poverty which isn't even adjusted for government aid programs; it isn't actually a measure of poverty, but of income inequality.

However, as noted by my post, poverty probably doesn't cause crime, it is more that criminals tend to be poor.

 Your post is a total non-sequitur, whether poverty is causally linked to crime has nothing to do with whether access to power is a corrupting influence.

If having more power made you more corrupt, then we would expect crime rates to increase with increasing levels of affluence.

Instead, we see the opposite - better off people tend to commit less crime.

This is evidence against the idea. It isn't a non-sequitur at all. </TEXT>

Was there any reason to believe otherwise?

That said, I think it is important to differentiate between liberalism and leftism. These studies seem to be conflating liberalism and leftism, but socialists and the ACLU have markedly different views on society.

I'd be interested in seeing if people who are more liberal (i.e. are more in favor of civil liberties) have the same level of confirmation bias as authoritarians.

A lot of people on the left are not particularly liberal. The anti-free speech folks on university campuses and the anti-property rights of socialists and anarchists are two good examples of such. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unions are often monopolies whose purpose is to eliminate competition and hike prices above the fair market rate. Hence their hostility towards scabs and historical links to organized crime.

They had a major purpose back in the day when company towns were a thing. But such cases of monospony are rare these days.

Moreover, the idea that unions are necessarily beneficial for compensation isn't even necessarily true.

This is not to say that unions are inherently bad - unions like SAG and the writer's guild are probably a good thing, at least to some extent (though there are some negatives there, such as protectionism). But the idea that unions are about "evening the playing field" isn't really correct.

If you've ever been fucked over on plumbing bills or electricians' bills or paid for an overpriced American car that wasn't very good, you have union price-fixing to thank for that.

Things like glassdoor.com and similar things - and a greater willingness to discuss compensation in general - are more valuable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While monospony-type situations can result in strange behavior, this is not a good example of such a situation. Housing construction isn't very monosponous; there's generally a lot of construction companies in large areas like this, and housing construction is much more pay-as-you-go than a lot of other industries - the amount of capital costs you need to start up your own construction company aren't so bad compared to a lot of other industries. This makes this industry a lot more vulnerable to outside competition, which weakens its state as a monospony.

Thus I wouldn't expect construction to be particularly vulnerable to this relative to some other industries, especially not in the region described in the article. Anywhere with 72,000 construction workers is a pretty populated area. Monosponous unemployment is more likely to occur in areas where there are few employment options, rather than areas like this, where there are a lot of employment options.

If the competitive market wage to hire new workers is really $11/hour, then why haven't their construction workers abandoned ship already?

An additional issue lies in the fact that wages *are* increasing. As the article notes:

 As the Dallas Morning News notes, between 2012 and 2016, wages for Texas construction workers rose 21.2 percent, compared with 12 percent for all construction jobs in the U.S.

Thus we're seeing wages going up for these people, which suggests that the monosponous wage stagnation being described in your post isn't happening here. In fact, wages are going up *faster* here than they are elsewhere.

It is also worth noting that housing prices are themselves increasing, which suggests that the marginal value of the labor is going up as well.

One plausible explanation is simply that there isn't a labor shortage at all - that the allegedly missing 18,000 construction workers simply don't exist. The perception of scarcity gives them a rationale for hiking prices on customers.

It is also possible that this may be just a repercussion of the pre-great recession construction boom, and there may yet be something of a glut of houses, reducing the demand for just generic "new houses", but people who are buying new houses are willing to pay a premium for the house *they* want. Thus the new housing market is confined to people who don't just want *a* house, they want a house with particular features which aren't available in the mass market.

I'm not sure how they're actually estimating that they're short 18,000 workers. Without knowing that, it is hard to say for sure.

But I'm suspicious of the argument that this is a result of monospony, because we're seeing above-average wage increases, which is the opposite of what we'd expect in such a situation. It seems likely to me that some other factor is in play here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sort of thing is inherently unsteady state. If you can raise prices, then you can hike wages and hire more people to build stuff at the new, higher prices you're getting and make more money.

You generally won't see this be persistent for any real length of time if it is possible to raise prices on consumers.

Thus, the situation will only really exist in two situations:

1) Consumers won't pay higher prices (i.e. they can wait), which makes paying higher wages impossible. This can happen if your customers are particularly price sensitive.

2) The situation is temporary, not permanent (i.e. the shortage is temporary/the surge in demand is temporary, but employees are likely to walk if you lower their wages back down after the surge in demand. Thus, even if you might be able to make money now by hiring more people and hiking wages, you'll lose money in the long term). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obama failed to sway the American public to his side, as proved by him failing to get a Congress that would do anything for him. He beat McCain and Romney for president, but he failed on the legislative end of things. Obamacare was a mess, and several parts of it - particularly with the rollout - were directly his fault.

He failed to deal with Syria correctly. He didn't bite the bullet and do what needed to be done, and instead we have the mess we have now as a result. He should have intervened in 2012. Yes, it would have sucked, but it would have sucked less than the ultimate outcome. He failed to show leadership.

He failed to appropriately deal with Russia in Ukraine. He failed to appropriately deal with Russia interfering in the Republican party, which did not start in 2016, but before that.

He failed to deal with Black Lives Matters. He failed to prevent the present crime surge, particularly in cities like Chicago, his hometown, and Baltimore.

He failed to deal with the far left. The far left is incredibly toxic, too. Sanders and his cohort constantly lie about important things as well - international trade, unemployment, ect. The so-called "SJWs" are also broadly hated and with good reason.

He was a weak, ineffectual president. He may have been a nice guy, but "things are hard" is not an excuse for failure, I'm afraid. Clinton was impeached by Congress and still managed to get a balanced budget passed. And there were a lot of things Obama could have done from the executive branch that he simply failed to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Median income has doubled since 1990.

*Real* median income has probably increased by less. My disagreement is that real median income has increased by a lot more than "almost nothing", which CPI claims, and that CPI is not a particularly good inflationary measure.

I would be interested in seeing how much real median income has actually changed by, but no one actually seems to be interested in studying that, instead blindly using inflationary indicies which were never designed for such a purpose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pot is not indicated for long-term pain. In fact, it isn't indicated for the treatment of any medical condition.

Pot has massive side effects, most notably the fact that it makes you high. This is a very deleterious side-effect for a medication to have. But its numerous other side effects aren't great either.

 Well than what does one with chronic pain do instead?

As I noted in my post, the appropriate regimen depends on the particular nature of the problem. Opiates are indicated for some conditions but not for others. I listed off a couple of conditions (pain from inflammation and pain from migraines) which I happen to know the proper treatments for offhand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Ask any clinician and they run into this all the time....

Clinicians are not scientists.

 Physicians were taught by purdue driven studies that you cannot get addicted to opioids if you are not using them recreationally and that simply proved false.

The addiction rate is very low. Doctors, not being scientists and generally being deeply ignorant of such things, often have to have things greatly simplified down for them, because they really don't understand science very well, unfortunately. And people unfortunately conflate "low" with "zero" or just decide that because it is non-zero, it must be high.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489635

Do people get addicted to opiates? Yes, of course they do. Is the addiction rate *high*? No. 3.27% is a low rate of addiction.

As noted:

 Within this grouping for those studies that had preselected CPPs for COAT exposure for no previous or current history of abuse/addiction, the percentage of abuse/addiction was calculated at 0.19%.

This is very low indeed.

If you dig into the study, you find that people who have a history of addiction and drug abuse have much higher rates of opiate addiction and misuse, with some finding that people with histories of drug abuse running as high as a 30% rate.

Opiates being ridiculously addictive is a myth. They're not.

The problem is that they're really prone to abuse. It isn't that most people are likely to end up abusing them, it is that people who abuse drugs are very likely to abuse opiates.

 Aside from rare specific circumstances long term opioids are not an appropriate treatment for chronic pain and chronic pain patients not on opioids should be wary of starting long term treatment plans with opioids.

There are conditions for which long-term use of opioids is indicated because there aren't any better treatments.

For conditions which have better treatments, they use other drugs instead of opiates because the other drugs improve their condition in other ways.

 A lot of those studies were pushed and funded by pharma. It now seems that those previous studies were wrong and some are based on old data that does not take into account modern synthetic opioids.

Such as what exactly?

I cited a study. Your turn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is flat-out false.

They've done studies on addiction to opiate painkillers in patients with long-term pain; only a very, very small fraction (only a few percentage points) became addicted.

However, among people with a history of addiction (particularly abuse of illegal drugs, less so nicotine addiction), the addiction rates are in the double digits.

Opiates, if used as prescribed, simply are not very addictive. It's a myth.

It isn't that opiates are particularly addictive, it is that addicts are particularly likely to misuse opiates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There ARE food labeling laws and they're pretty specific. Like, mayonnaise has a legal definition. The reason why some places have stuff that's called "meat filling" instead of "100% beef" is because the meat filling isn't a high enough percentage of meat.

Contrary to what a lot of people believe, though, this isn't because the rest is some sort of mystery stuff or whatever; it's usually because a lot of it is either binder (to give it a certain consistency) or other ingredients (like spices, flavoring, ect.). [Taco Bell, for instance, is 88% premium beef,](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/29/taco-bell-beef_n_5232605.html) with the rest is various other ingredients.

For example, [here's FDA guidance WRT % juice labelling.](https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064872.htm):

 Answer: An exception is that beverages containing minor amounts of juice for flavoring are not required to bear a % juice declaration provided that: (a) the product is described using the term flavor or flavored, (b) the term juice is not used other than in the ingredient list, and (c) the beverages do not otherwise give the impression they contain juice such as with the use of explicit vignettes on the label or physical resemblance of the beverage to juice such as pulp. 21 CFR 101.30(c)

	<TEXT> I explained above why illegal immigration was bad. Did you not read that?

We have border controls for a reason. Do you not understand what those reasons are?

If you don't understand why we have border controls in the first place, then you cannot have a meaningful conversation about them.

We have multiple reasons for border controls, but they all basically boil down to one thing: we want to keep out undesirable foreigners.

Mexico isn't shitty because it is south of the United States; it is shitty because it is full of Mexicans. Mexico is a corrupt country where people bribe cops, cops take bribes, a lot of people idolize the narcos, a lot of people *are* narcos, there's a general disregard for the well-being of others and human life, a lot of people don't have very sophisticated skill sets, ect.

Syria isn't shitty because it is Syria, it is shitty because it is full of Syrians. They are a fractious bunch who hate each others' guts and think it is appropriate to kill each other, while still others flee instead of standing up for what's right.

Is everyone in these countries shitty?

No. But we don't want everyone from those countries to come here.

Hence border controls. We can weed out the less desirable people and let in the more desirable ones. This keeps the US a nice place.

This is why it is easy to enter the US if you're Canadian and harder if you're, say, from the Congo. Canadians are very similar to us, so it isn't really the end of the world if they come here; even if someone illegally immigrates from Canada, they're more or less from the same society, so the downside is small. Moreover, because Canada is a nice place, it is less likely that someone is going to come here to ditch their home country in the first place.

Conversely, the Congo sucks. The average person there is going to have a hard time in our economy, and there's a huge incentive for them to stay in the US illegally rather than return home. </TEXT>

Pesticide is safe when it is used appropriately. The amount of pesticide we ingest via food is harmless because it is simply very small. It isn't something which is designed to be chugged by humans, it is something designed to be applied to plants.

That's like saying toothpaste is horrible because you shouldn't eat a whole tube of the stuff. Or that aspirin is dangerous because if you eat a couple bottles of it you'll die.

That being said, the acute oral LD50 of glysophate in rats is 5,600 mg/kg. So for a 70 kg human, that'd be about 392 g of glysophate. You could probably drink a cup of pure glysophate without dying.

This isn't surprising, given that the LD50 of glysophate is similar to that of pure ethanol, which has a LD50 of about 7,000 mg/kg.

And it is worth remembering that Roundup is diluted - depending on the formulation, it is somewhere between 2% and 41% glysophate. So that's even less dangerous.

I'd be willing to drink a dose of glysophate relative to someone drinking a similar dose of water compared to normal ingestion of water. [They'd die long before I suffered any ill effect from the glysophate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication)

That being said, the acute oral LD50 of glysophate in rats is 5,600 mg/kg. So for a 70 kg human, that'd be about 392 g of glysophate. You could probably drink a cup of glysophate without dying.

I'd be willing to drink a dose of glysophate relative to someone drinking a similar dose of water compared to normal ingestion of water. [They'd die long before I suffered any ill effect from the glysophate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication)
