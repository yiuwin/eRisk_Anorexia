	<TEXT> While I can appreciate the skill and the art, there is always a little sadness when I see alters for the reason you mentioned. Somebody posted a pic of a signed Alpha Lotus on here not too long ago. It was signed by Richard Garfield with a bic pen. While Richard is the man, the writing on an otherwise perfect Lotus just looked terrible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh awesome, thanks! What's crazy is, that wasn't even the music I noticed as Morricone's, so I'm pretty sure there is *another* part in the movie that uses this: https://youtu.be/REYcShr_lQY?list=PL0828E3D6929DFDB6 t=166

I don't remember what is happening in Hateful Eight at that point of the movie, but this is the music is playing. Apparently people in the Youtube comments noticed this as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This movie gives a HUGE nod to John Carpenter's "The Thing". The only sad part about this for me is that I think few people will notice this (I could be wrong).
The scenario of both movies is putting a bunch of guys indoors, surrounded by a blizzard/extreme cold weather, they start to slowly (or quickly in some cases) distrust each other. 
On a visual level, it hit me when they have to tie a line to the outhouse. In one scene from H8ful Eight, there is music directly FROM "The Thing" - a score also made by Ennio Morricone.
The endings are vaguely similar in that it shows the last 2 guys left and the whole place has gone to shit. But the tone is quite different - the ending of Hateful Eight is pretty much a happy one. 
Maybe I am just a "Thing" fanboy, but I couldn't help but draw a corollary between the two. And just to be clear, this isn't a "Quentin stole from The Thing!!!" post, it's just something cool I noticed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Has anybody else been humming the main theme music since seeing the movie? It's been stuck in my head (in a good way). I had been reading and watching interviews of Tarantino talk about his collaboration with Ennio Morricone, so I had high expectations. But the music more than delivered, dare I say it almost eclipsed the movie in a way. As others have mentioned, the opening shot with the crucifix has really stuck with me visually and musically. </TEXT>
