	<TEXT> Smart Question! I love it! Here's what I would do!

*Let Living Scenery sit on the back burner for a while; Have that and both Helping Hands be a little less frequent.

*Have them play Let's Make a Date; The guest is the contestant, The other four have the quirks; Possibly try that out for Party Quirks (Guest is the host;Other four, etc etc)

*Singing Guests; No more Song Styles/Duet to them. Let them sing w/Wayne or Wayne/Singer Fourth seater to an audience member. Song Styles becoming Duet (Wayne/Guest) and Duet becoming Trio (Wayne/Fourth/Guest); Perhaps one occasion the special guest joins Wayne or Wayne/Fourth in Greatest Hits. 

*Little more frequent on Three Headed Broadway Star; Either Wayne/Fourth/Colin to Guest or Fourth/Guest/Ryan to Audience Member.

*On rare occasions switch it up on Sound Effects; Both one audience member and the special guest provide the Sound Effects. (Imagine if they got Michael Winslow and he played the game!!)

*Daytime Talk Show (Take a look at the Jerry Springer playing!)

*Questions; We saw it with Cedric yes, but why not have all five do it (All Four + Guests) 

*Scenes From a Hat; On a few occasions perhaps we should see them with the other four, trying the game.

Long Story short, I don't see it lasting long, Both that and The Messengers don't do well on Friday's (Resulting in Cedric being Pulled and Messengers getting cancelled); Also looks like Whose Line survives the Friday line up again; It'll be switched to Monday's in July and a New Season is expected in 2016.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's no reason to not watch it; It's just as good without Drew. This is the thing that kills me. It doesn't matter who hosts it! If we're getting the improv we know and love, the games we know and love. Why should who's hosting matter? We've got the same cast performing for us! It worked with Clive, It worked with Drew, and It works with Aisha!!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the two complaints, we're pretty early into the Season. The editor is bound to edit more points giving away into the show. Aisha gives away a load of points during the tapings, nearly after every game; It's just what the editor decides to keep in. Same goes for Credit Readings, Think its a third time the editor put in an all four credit reading. (And they do at least 4-5 each taping!) Same also goes to the audience suggestion and participation games, It's what the editor does (They're choosing out of 18-22 played games; though the editor could make a load of better choices!) </TEXT>
