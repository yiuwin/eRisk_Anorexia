	<TEXT> I was making an educated assumption based on the fact that you were taught what a period was, grammatically, while not many other first-world countries are taught the same thing, and considering 64% of native english speakers live in the US [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world), it is not unreasonable to assume so. Especially when you take into account your knowledge of the period, while not many other countries are exposed to said name. </TEXT>
