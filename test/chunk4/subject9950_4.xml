	<TITLE> Orientalism and Kunlun </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-25 11:28:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> One of the things that worries me about the Iron Fist series is the Orientalism.  I mean, Danny Rand survives a plane crash and finds himself in Kunlun.  Is that the real place in China or the mythical place of Chinese myth, home to the Jade Emperor?  Because the latter may turn off some people.

Imagine the reverse.  Imagine a Chinese drama about a young boy from China whose plane crashes on Mount Olympus and he learns the ways of Western culture from the gods of Olympus and returns to China with god like powers.  Actually, that sounds a lot like the Percy Jackson books.

The point is that if they want people to take Iron Fist seriously then they might want to downplay the mythical aspect.  Just as Olympus is an actual place in Greece, Kunlun is an actual place in China and you could totally go there and study martial arts.  There's even a martial arts style called Kun Lun Fist.  It can't be a coincidence: the creators of Iron Fist had to know that, like Olympus, Kunlun is both an actual place and a mythical place.

Finn Jones said recently in an interview that the Iron Fist series will be "taking these superhero characters, and bringing them down to the real world, and youre making them have very real problems".  If that's the case then I am going to be disappointed if Kunlun turns out to be some mystical city in the clouds.

	<TEXT> Actually, it might have been Hugh Jackman who wanted to be in Captain America: The First Avenger as an Easter egg.  That would have been cool.  Hugh Jackman would have been up for it.  Hugh Jackman, reportedly, was going to cameo in the original Spider-Man movie but it fell through because Sony wanted Hugh to appear in costume and there was no way Fox was going to agree to that.  

An early draft of X-Men 2 had a cameo with the Fantastic Four but Fox was not going to pay marque actors for ten seconds of screen time.  X-Men 2 similarly originally had a Nightcrawler / Toad fight in the script and was going to introduce Gambit.  We can't complain though because X-Men 2 turned out great.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I have an idea for a Marvel Studios related flash game </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-23 17:22:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ive got an idea for a flash game called Interviews with Kevin Feige.  You start in 2007 interviewing Kevin Feige about the 2008 Iron Man movie.  In every level you try to get him to reveal information about future movies and TV shows.

Level 1.  Its 2007.  Try to get Kevin to spill the beans on the Iron Man movie.  Ask him the right questions and he will tell you about the end credits scene with Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury.

Level 2.  Its 2008.  Ask Kevin Feige about future plans with Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Wasp and Ant Man.  Ask him the right questions and he will lay out all his plans for Phase 1 of the MCU.

Level 3.  Its 2009.  Ask Kevin Feige about Iron Man 2.  Iron Man 2 should already be filming so he should have some footage to show you.

Level 4.  Its 2010.  Ask Kevin Feige about the Thor and Captain America movies and try to get him to show some footage.  He should also have some pre-production story boards from the Avengers he can show.

Level 5.  Its 2011.  Try to get Kevin Feige to show some Avengers footage.  Ask him the right questions and he will tell you that Thanos appears at the end.

Level 6.  Its 2012.  Ask Kevin Feige about Phase 2 movies starting with Iron Man 3 and Thor 2.  Ask him the right questions and he will tell you the Mandarin / Trevor twist and how Loki manages to secretly replace Odin as the leader of Asgard. 

Level 7.  Its 2013.  Ask Kevin Feige about Agents of SHEILD, Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy.  Ask him the right questions and he will tell you that Agents Stitwell and Ward are working for Hydra.

Level 8.  Its 2014.  Ask Kevin Feige about Age of Ultron and Ant Man.  Ask him the right questions and he will tell you about Quicksilver dying and the Vision picking up Thors hammer.

Level 9.  Its 2015.  Ask Kevin Feige about Phase 3 starting with Civil War and Doctor Strange.  Ask him the right questions and he will tell you that Spider-Man and Black Panther show up in Civil War and that the eye of Agamoto is actually the time gem and that Doctor Strange uses it to stop Dormammu.

Level 10.  Its 2016.  Ask Kevin Feige about Spider-Man: Homecoming and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.  Ask him the right questions and he will tell you about how Michael Keaton will be playing the Vulture and who will be playing Starlords father.

And so on.  Future versions of the game would be released every year as new information about future movies becomes available.  The game would feature a mix of actual quotes from Kevin Feige with things that he would never have actually said in interviews because they would have spoiled things.

	<TEXT> In theory, either Alan Fine or Joe Quesada could take Feige's job.  Joe Quesada has been Chief Creative Officer at Marvel Comics since 2010.  That's the same position Geoff Johns had from 2010 to 2016 before being promoted to President of DC Entertainment.  In other words, Geoff Johns had Joe Quesada's job at DC Entertainment but then got promoted and now has Kevin Feige's job at DC Entertainment.  People have speculated that Geoff Johns and David S Goyer were both up for the job but given the success of the DC CW series versus the failure of Batman v Superman it was Geoff Johns who got the promotion.  In Kevin Feige's case, Captain America: Civil War was a huge success so he's in a much better position than David S. Goyer was.

Meanwhile, I really don't know much about Alan Fine.  He is President of Marvel Entertainment but he answers to Isaac Perlmutter who is Marvel CEO.  Kevin Feige, meanwhile, answers directly to Bob Iger who is the CEO of Disney.  As I understand it, Ike Perlmutter, Alan Fine, Brian Michael Michael Bendis, Dan Buckley, Joe Quesada and Jeph Loeb form a "creative committee" that oversee Marvel TV: Ike is the CEO, Alan is the President, Brian is a prolific writer for Marvel, Dan is the publisher for Marvel, Joe is the CCO and Jeph is the head of Marvel TV.  Brian and Dan are too busy on the comics side of things to have a larger role at Marvel Entertainment.

Long story short, there are people waiting for Kevin Feige to fail.  Whether or not they actually want Kevin Feige to fail is another question.  After all, it was Kevin Feige himself who brought in Brian Michael Michael Bendis, Dan Buckley, Joe Quesada and Jeph Loeb in the first place so that creative decisions would not come down to the opinions of men in suits who cared only about making money and who knew nothing about the source material.

I think if Kevin Feige got hit by a bus then he would want Joe Quesada to take over because Ike would expect his buddy Alan to answer to him as Marvel CEO and Feige wouldn't want that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR

Thanos shows up in Nepal.  He is after the time stone.

Wong: Begone, Mad Titan!

Thanos: Out of my way!

He takes the stone.  He leaves.

Strange shows up.

Strange: What happened here?

Wong: Thanos has taken the time stone.

Strange: Who is Thanos?

Wong gives Thanos a backstory.

Wong: As of right now... we... are... at war!

Cut to Asgard.

Thor, Sif, Banner, Valkyrie and the Warriors Three are having a party to celebrate their victory in Thor: Ragnarok.  Thanos shows up.

Thor: Begone, strange purple man!

Thanos: Out of my way!

Valkyrie: NO!  We shall... defend... this realm!

Banner hulks up.

Thanos uses the time gem to freeze them all in place and simply takes the tesseract.  He leaves.

Strange arrives.  He has brought the entire Avengers team with him (except Ant Man and the Wasp who have their own movie).  Tony and Steve complain about how they don't like each other anymore.  Strange tells them that they need to set aside their petty differences and get this done.

Strange: First, we need to find Thanos.

Heimdall: I have found him!  He isn't exactly hiding.  He is on Xandar.

Strange and Odin muster up a large enough portal to send the Avengers and a large amount of Asgardian troops to Xandar.  The Nova Corps and the Guardians line up with them.

Thanos already has three stones.  He laughs.

Thanos: You have saved me the trouble of going back to Earth and taking the mind stone!  I shall simply take it from your companion's forehead!

Cap: Not today!

Iron Man: Avengers assemble!

Strange quickly recites a spell that prevents Thanos from using the stones.

Strange: We must act quickly!  I can only hold back his power for so long!

Thanos fights the Avengers and appears to be winning.  He is about to grab the mind stone from the Vision's forehead.  Captain Marvel appears from nowhere.

Captain Marvel: Not so fast, Mister!

Captain Marvel quickly overpowers Thanos.  The other Avengers recover.  But Thanos is getting stronger as the spell that Strange recited begins to fade.  Then Loki appears.  He is carrying his staff.  It no longer has the mind stone but it still packs a whollop.

Thanos: You dare betray me!

Loki: I am not betraying you!  I was betraying them!

Odin appears.

Odin: For Asgard!

Thor: For Earth!

Loki: For myself!

The Avengers pile on Thanos.  They take the infinity Gauntlet from his hand.  He is defeated.

Nova: You Avengers have fought bravely!  I am R'chard R'der of the Nova Corps!  I wish to go with you and be one of your members!

Quasar: I am a Kree!  We and the Xandarians have traditionally been enemies but today I fought alongside all of you!  I too wish to join you!

Captain Marvel: Actually, I'm from Earth.  You don't know who I am so you're going to have to watch my solo movie.

AVENGERS 4: RAMPAGE

Back on Earth, the Leader has used Bruce Banner's blood to make an army of Hulks.  They have all been driven mad, except Jennifer Walters who, while tall, green and strong, has not been driven mad by her cousin's blood.

People on Earth ask "Where are the Avengers when we need them?"  The Defenders and the Agents of SHIELD are seen fighting Hulks on the streets.

The Avengers arrive with the Guardians of the Galaxy.  

Nova: You saved my world so I will help you save yours.

Starlord: This is my world too!  It's a long story.

The Avengers and the Guardians fight and defeat the Hulks.  Then they take down the Leader himself.  She Hulk explains that she isn't insane and, in fact, can help.

With the Leader defeated, the Avengers and the Guardians assemble at Avengers compound.  Thunderbolt Ross shows up.

Ross: While we are all very grateful for you saving the world, there are some who would call you... vigilantes.

Stark: Right.  Sorry, for not asking permission before we took down the guy who was going to destroy everything.

Ross: Quite.  Look, I've spoken to the President.  He says that a group this size is too much.  First, the Guardians have to leave.

Starlord: Can I at least stay long enough to watch a Simon Williams movie?  I mean, man, come on!

Ross: Second, Captain America, Iron Man and Doctor Strange must operate in separate groups.   It is way too expensive for Marvel to hire all of you actors for every movie going forward.

Steve: I can live with that.

Tony: Works for me.

Ross: Alright then, so let's hope this movie makes a lot of money and spawns a lot of sequels!

	<TEXT> The Universal monsters were also in a shared universe.  Shared universes are not that uncommon.  Think of all the TV shows that have spin offs.  What is different about the Marvel shared universe is that they have a narrative that flows through the different movies.  The Avengers movies are not just one off events that bring our heroes together: they are part of an over arching narrative that continues in the solo movies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein_Meets_the_Wolf_Man

"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is a 1943 American monster horror film produced by Universal Studios starring Lon Chaney, Jr. as the Wolf Man and Bela Lugosi as Frankenstein's monster. This was the first of a series of "ensemble" monster films combining characters from several film series." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, SHIELD is _probably_ going to be renewed and Season 5 will premiere in November after the Inhumans have finished their eight episode run.  It may not be renewed in 2018.  The characters on Agents of SHIELD simply aren't interesting enough to warrant their own show.  It was okay when the Agents of SHIELD were fighting Hydra and the Watchdogs but I don't know if a season of the Agents of SHIELD reacting to the events in Infinity War is enough to sustain an entire Season 6.  I'm not even sure what Season 5 will be about.  If Inhumans Season 2 is only eight episodes then perhaps they can do eight episodes shows for Ghost Rider and Blade.  The Agents of SHIELD would be characters that show up on all three shows so it would be as if Agents of SHIELD had continued for another season but it wouldn't just be them reacting to Infinity War.  But, yeah, having the Inhumans, Ghost Rider, Blade, the Defenders and the Agents of SHIELD team up against the Chitari would be cool. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know.  A Ghost Rider show would be expensive for ABC and would have to be shown at 10:00 because it is not for kids.  Streaming services can show more adult content because parents can choose not to subscribe to streaming services that has questionable content.  Plus, like I said, we'd be more likely to get an Inhumans Season 2 than Ghost Rider on ABC.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If New Warriors, Ghost Rider, Blade, Kamala Khan and Damage Control all got pilot orders who would distribute what? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-10 17:41:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Marvel is distributing content on multiple platforms (Netflix, ABC, Hulu and Freeform) so it is no longer a question of just Netflix and ABC anymore.  New Warriors, Ghost Rider, Blade, Kamala Khan and Damage Control series are all rumored to varying degrees.  If they all got pilot orders then which shows would appear where?

NETFLIX already has the Defenders and the Punisher.  One advantage that Netflix has is that the seasons are only 13 episodes and they new seasons don't come out every year.  That means that they can add new shows and give themselves more time to work on the shows that they already have.  This can be a blessing because it makes crossovers easier: Iron Fist can appear in Luke Cage because the actor playing Iron Fist isn't busy filming his own series while Luke Cage is filming.

The Punisher is the first Defenders spin off.  While there are no rumors of an Elektra spin off, Elektra is confirmed to be returning in the Defenders and if the character is still alive at the end of the Defenders then she could return in Daredevil, the Punisher and / or her own series.

Similarly, while there has been speculation of a Moon Knight series, there has been nothing from Marvel (other than a comment from James Gunn that he had a idea for Moon Knight but that he himself didn't have time to do it) to indicate that a Moon Knight series was in the works.  What Marvel could do is have Moon Knight appear in an existing Marvel Netflix series and then, as was the case with the Punisher, see how fans react.  They could do the same thing with Spider-Woman.

Ghost Rider and Blade, however, are strongly rumored to be in development, with the sources being Gabriel Luna and Wesley Snipes, respectively.  Nicholas Cage also said that he did "not want to reprise his role as Ghost Rider" although the question could have been referring to a movie and not a Netflix series.  Wesley Snipes also, presumably was talking about a movie when he said "the ball is in Marvel's court".  The older he gets the more likely it is that they would simply hire a new actor to play Blade.  Perhaps this time the could get someone with a British accent like Blade in the comics.  It would be a shame if Marvel couldn't get Cage and Snipes to cameo though in the same way John Wesley Shipp and Dean Cain cameo on Flash and Supergirl.

HULU has Runaways.  They aren't going to pick up the New Warriors because, bottom line, the two teams of teenaged superheroes are superficially too similar.  Besides, if they did a crossover there would be way too many characters.  Hulu would then be a good platform for John Ridley's rumored Kamala Khan series.  John Ridley could be secretly working on a script and casting Kamala Khan and if Runways works out then a Kamala Khan series could be announced and could then be released in time to reference the Captain Marvel movie and / or crossover with a second season of Runaways.

FREEFORM has Cloak and Dagger and could pick up New Warriors.  New Warriors is supposed to be a lighthearted comedy which would make it much less dark than the shows streaming on Netflix or Hulu.  Freeform used to be ABC Family so Cloak and Dagger is also supposed to be lighthearted and family friendly so the two shows could have synergy in Freeform.

ABC has Agents of SHIELD and an eight episode season of Inhumans coming in the fall.  As Inhumans is only scheduled for eight episodes, people are assuming that Agents of SHIELD will get renewed for a shortened Season 5 after the first season of Inhumans ends.  If Inhumans gets renewed for a full season then that could spell the end of Agents of SHIELD, although with the Inhumans supposedly taking the Agents of SHIELD time slot, it wouldn't be so much a question of Agents of SHIELD being cancelled so much as the show being replaced with another Marvel show with a different cast.  Daisy and Yoyo could easily show up in Inhumans Season 2 and not be out of place.

The only other Marvel show that could appear on ABC is Damage Control.  Really, it depends how well Powerless does on NBC.  I guess that means if you want to see Damage Control on ABC then you need to watch Powerless on NBC and get the ratings up.  If Powerless is a flop on NBC then ABC is going to say "No" to Damage Control.  Whereas streaming services can offer as much content as viewers are willing to watch, networks can only fit so much content into their evening schedule and are more likely to turn down pilots.  ABC already turned down Marvel's Most Wanted.  (To be fair, the title was the worst.  They should have called it Mockingbird.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> John Ridley supposedly wants to do a Kamala Khan TV show.  I think they want to wait until the Captain Marvel movie is coming out and then she can take up the name Ms. Marvel as a homage to Captain Marvel.  You just gave me a good idea though.  KAMALA KHAN could be the name of the show.  I mean, it worked for JESSICA JONES.  That way they don't have to wait until after the Captain Marvel movie comes out to introduce the character.  There could be an announcement soon.  Most likely distributor would be ABC Freeform or Hulu seeing as how they have one show each right now.  There could be an announcement soon.  I imagine that they could have KAMALA KHAN on Hulu and NEW WARRIORS on Freeform and do crossovers with RUNAWAYS and CLOAK AND DAGGER.  A RUNAWAYS / NEW WARRIORS crossover would be difficult because there would be so many characters.

They could also add THUNDERBOLTS and NIGHT STALKERS to Netflix but a crossover with DEFENDERS would be difficult. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it possible Rip is not being brainwashed?

Presumably Rip wants the spear of destiny so he can save his wife and son.  The question becomes why he didn't use the spear of destiny before.

An even better question though is why he had a piece of the spear of destiny in the first place.  The Legion of Doom assumed that Rip was entrusted to the spear of destiny and was keeping it safe.  What if Rip was looking for the spear of destiny himself but he didn't have the amulet so he couldn't find the other pieces?

Rip originally formed the Legends to save his wife and son and the spear of destiny was only a back up plan in case they didn't succeed.  He had no way of finding the other pieces.  Indeed, Gideon herself didn't even know that he had a piece of the spear of destiny and he was looking for the other pieces.

So why wipe his memory?  Why become a film student?  Why bother bringing the piece of the spear with him?

He obviously planned to have somebody find him and go to the bank in 2025 and get his lost memories.  That was all part of his plan.  It was a pretty shitty plan though.  How did he know the Legion of Doom would come after him?

It doesn't really make a lot of sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I got the gist of what you are saying.  Here's my reaction.

It seems as though you might think you are too good for the work you are doing.  That might make it hard for you to make friends because you will sub-consciously look down on the people you are working with.  At the same time if you regard them as whores you may think of yourself the same way and this will lower your self esteem.  Remember that every job requires skills and that you are being paid for your skills. You are not just a piece of meat being put on display.  You have been doing this work for a while now and you have an advantage over someone who shows up with no prior experience.  Try to think of your job as not just a job but an art form.  It isn't just stripping: it's dancing and you have an opportunity to express yourself on stage.

Don't be so quick to dismiss people's concern about you.  If they think you look like an addict then it could be you are not eating enough.  Also if there is something in your demeanor that puts people off you might want to change things up.  Don't drink alcohol at work unless you really need it to relax.  Think of drinking some coffee before you go to work: you are working at a time when you might normally want to sleep.  And don't take any drugs other than the drugs you are already taking for your anti-depression.  It is dangerous to mix drugs, alcohol and medication.  Besides, they may be able to pick up on the fact that you are taking anti-depressants.  I don't know how.

Try not to be a prude.  You admit that you enjoy porn and you think about sex a lot and yet you look down on your coworkers and your customers and think this work is beneath you.  Keep in mind that you did not get a university education and that you basically chose this lifestyle when you chose not to continue your formal education.  That is the harsh reality.  Keep in mind though, that it does not make you a lesser person because you did not get a university degree.  Every job that you get paid for is a job that fills a void.  The guys go to the clubs not just to be entertained but to interact and socialize.  Pleasing the customers requires a skill set that needs to be developed.

Being ashamed of how you make a loving can be a downward spiral.  You may feel less about yourself but then wonder what else you can do and feel that you are not good for anything else.  Think positively: you have a job and you are getting paid for a job and that means that people think that you are good at that job.  Don't feel bad about the fact that you have had jobs before and lost them.  Focus on the job you have now.

If you don't like the job you have right now then you might want to consider working at a different club.  You worked at other clubs before and maybe they don't want you back so that might make things difficult.  I think if there are girls at your club that also work at other clubs then you might want to make friends with them  to make a connection and maybe get introduced to the owner of a different club.  I realize this isn't easy because girls are competing with each other and they might not want you at a club where they and you can make more money because that doesn't help them.  Then again, club owners are always on the lookout for talent and if you can convince somebody that you are somebody with talent and experience then you would be able to make a move to a better club.

Finally, yes, you are right.  Your physical appearance is an important part of your job and the fact that you don't have a university education means that you would not be able to do anything else when you are too old to strip.  So maybe you can take classes during the day and strip in the evening.  Not for a university degree but for something practical, something useful for a job when you aren't stripping any more.

And, yeah, it is selfish of me, but I kind of think it would be a good idea for you to do some work in front of a camera, if only because it means you will be seen by a wider audience.  You take pictures of yourself and put them on the net so you're not shy so that's not a problem.  And when you are too old to model or act then you can transition to working behind the camera, which seems to be the sort of thing you want to do.

Keep in mind that you can be creative in anything you do.  You have an opportunity right now to express yourself doing what you are already doing.  You just need to figure out where you want to be ten years from now. </TEXT>
