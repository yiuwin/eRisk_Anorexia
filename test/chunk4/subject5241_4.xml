	<TEXT> Ouch, I've seen quite a few too, including one where no I just didn't feel a thing. It happened in the er and I remember the family was just annoying(not that like sad/scared annoying but like rude and idiot annoying) and I walked by them as they crowded the door to the entrance(which I wanted them to back wayyyy away from). So anyway I walked by them and in all of their stupidity I didn't feel a thing, just kept walking. I walked back into the er and saw them, again felt nada. Then there's been some where I've felt everything and yeah. There'll be some where ya feel it all and some where you don't. Let's go be great.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What's one thing a patient or family member (technically patient too) has said that's stuck with you? Whether it was positive or negative, and how did it help?

For me it was as a student, I got someone a chair, and asked about the person they were with to see if they could say a quick hello(aka stable enough for a quick one second) and they did stop so she could say she loved him and she turned to me, hugged me and she and her sister(a nurse at a different hospital) said to me "you'll be a great nurse." It just helps when I'm having a long day as a student to know that people believe in me, even if it was after such a small thing to do on my part.

Mine as a student was at the ER and I knew an incoming critical was coming in, and they got there I heard they were 18, few minutes later they died. It just struck me hard that they were 3 years younger than me and I couldn't piece together why it happened. The only reason I got through it was because one of our security guards who I'm friends with saw me and hugged me because they just knew.  </TEXT>
