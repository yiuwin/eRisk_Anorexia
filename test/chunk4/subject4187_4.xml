	<TEXT> I've had high success rate with WBTB. I've tried reality checks but i never got to the point where I've been doing them religiously 1-2 times a hour or when certain parameters are met. However WBTB is as simple as setting a alarm to wake up in the middle of the night then going back to sleep and for me, I don't need a reality check to realize i'm lucid most times i just kinda know especially since before I go to bed the 2nd time I visualize myself becoming lucid. Reality checks are only good for grounding yourself in the dream more, at least for me.

But I suppose if you get consistent at reality checking you could increase the chances of becoming lucid  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try WBTB. It's a really good way to induce a LD, and it pairs up really nicely with what you are already doing (Reality Checks and Dream Journaling). 

Just go to sleep for about 5ish hours and set a alarm to wake up after the 5 hours then stay up for about 15-45mins then go back to sleep. While your awake you want to think about Lucid Dreaming, try visualizing becoming lucid in a dream. Try to avoid going to the computer or watching tv during this time. It has a really high success rate so try it if you haven't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the first part of the fight. 
[1]Attack the guy when he is by himself.
[2]When the 2nd guy appears try to stay away from them and buy time for the 3rd guy to show up
[3]When the 3rd guy comes he will attack the other two
[4]While they are fighting each other try to attack the main one(the one that drops the health bar of the actual boss). Try not to attack the one with the red eyes/the 'evil' one as it will make him aggro on to you which means gg
[5]Keep doing that until first part is over

Second Stage.
[1]This guys does fire damage I believe so get some fire resist
[2]His attacks have a fire AOE part so be sure to not get too close to him. His combos are also very long so if you get caught in them (mainly the spining one I think) it's gg
[3]Wait for him to do the dashing attack where he dashes to you and leaves a fire trail. Once he does that roll dodge to the side where the fire is not there, this is your window of attack because he will take a bit to recover. Get a couple of hits in and roll to safety.
[4]Continue this until Victory.

Very fun boss imo, music is amazing. Good Luck! Let me know if I helped

Edit: You can backstab and parry him also. Backstabs are safer so do that in the first part of the fight also when he dashes to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just say "I don't really know a lot about sports" or something like that. Then change the topic (do it in a way that doesn't sound like you are being rude, disguise it as a question or something), but don't start talking about anything too serious because that will catch people off guard most of the time (most not all). You said you like talking about science so talk about that, you can have some really cool conversations about astronomy or physics that are also 'light' and people will mostly be interested in what you have to say, at least for me. I wouldn't talk about politics or anything tragic in the news unless you can "feel them out" and see in they can handle it, if you know what I mean. Talking about how the universe works can lead to some really deep conversation I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly man, you just have to practice it. Fake it til you make it. I'm not a big fan of small talk either, but I understand why small talk exists. The more you practice it, the less draining it becomes.

 You can learn a lot about someone through small talk that can allow you to ask follow up questions to get deeper into whatever you're talking about, which can progivessly lead to interesting conversation. 

It doesn't always have to be about sports or the weather. Ask people what they are studying in college or what do they do for work. Or if it is about sports, ask then what made them intersted in it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I keep seeing posts talking about how disappointing spells are in this game. I really don't want that to be the case, because I love this game for the different play styles available to you, and it would be terrible if the only good builds are generic Str/Dex builds (without castings). Also do you think they would buff some of the weaker spells?  </TEXT>
