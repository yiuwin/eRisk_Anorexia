	<TEXT> Yeah the hardest bit was just getting started! I made it a routine and eventually it became habit. Some days my workout didn't feel like it did much. But then I was told the only workout that's bad, is the one you didn't do. Keep going mate, and thank you  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's all about the little steps. A few more calories, a few more fork fulls of whatever. The hardest thing for me was loving myself. I felt envious of everyone for being "normal" and having weight. One day I realised that me and my body are on the same team, so we started acting like one. Good on you man, proud of you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! 3 I think a lot of mental health issues all men suffer with are a stigma. There's the whole concept men are meant to be strong and we are somewhat immune to mental illness so it's looked down on. I still get the looks when I talk about it today! Hopefully this post helps though, everyone has been amazing in this subreddit! Thank you again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! It took me a while to post mainly because I hate looking at the first picture. It's a mix of shame and embarrassment. Eventually I came to realise that it's me, regardless. And that's nothing to be ashamed about!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One reason I posted this is because I lurked for a long time without posting, and I wouldn't have been alone. Hopefully others in similar situations to me can realise they can do whatever their aims are too! Thank you :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks dude! I lived a long time telling myself I couldn't do things. It got to the point I told myself I couldn't do things I hadn't even tried, to protect myself incase I failed. I guess one day I stopped and said "why can't I?" And it all stemmed from there!

Thank you for the kind words  </TEXT>
