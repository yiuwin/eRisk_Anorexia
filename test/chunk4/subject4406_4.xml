	<TEXT> Get something that you enjoy seeing everyday. Don't get something that's on trend now, but will be out of style in a few months. If you can get some hands on some older home decor magazines, see what is still in style now. Know your budget. Maybe buy or invest in some art that you really enjoy. Commission something if you can afford it. Shop around, use pininterst boards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This game was recommended to me by a bunch of people from reddit for my partner who has PTSD. Honestly, it has changed my partners life. Playing games again is exciting and and it's amazing not having to worry about guns, cars running over people, seeing terrible gore. Thanks you so much u/concernedape  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your reply. I've never framed a coin before. Do you know if coin shops would do this? I don't think I'm game enough to cut the loop myself. I guess I could find a jeweler who would? I think the loop is made out of gold too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yesterday my mum came over and gave me some things that I inherited from my grandmother who died in 1994. I was too young back then. This coin was one of the things. From my research, it's a 1861 Gold Sovereign : Victoria (Young Head) Shield. I don't want to sell it, I'd like to frame it if I can. But it has this loop on it, which I assume my grandmother wore around her neck. Any ideas on how (or even if) I can remove it?

Here's the other side: https://imgur.com/gallery/GZMmH </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There have been a few posts I've seen about "Hey I'm visiting/moving to [insert city]. Where are all the lesbians at!"

	<TEXT> One of my New Years resolutions was to read 12 books in 12 months. I enjoy reading, it's more about the time doing it. No idea what books to start with. I really enjoy motivational books, fantasy novels (I've read a lot of robin hobb) and anything to do with my career (user experience/user interface design). Any recommendations? </TEXT>
