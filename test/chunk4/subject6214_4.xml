	<TEXT> I'd recommend International Superhits. Not an "album" but a great way to get into their early work. 

American Idiot and Dookie are of course the most commercially
 successful but my personal favourite three albums are(in no particular order):
-Dos!
-Kerplunk
-Nimrod

	<TEXT> As the title says I picked this up for 15 at my nearest record shop (around 55 miles away). Sadly, the store owner was struggling to pay rent (mentioned this after my purchase so it wasn't a pity buy). It was only a small record shop but enough to keep me busy for half an hour. I went in looking for Green Day and David Bowie. I'd recently become interested in Bowie's earlier stuff after coming across a job lot of 175 7" for 35! This contained a couple of Bowie's singles including The Laughing Gnome which is an absolute joy to listen to. However, I purchased 2 Saxon vinyl, a Flotsam and Jetsam vinyl, a Kiss vinyl and a Dio vinyl. My overall spend was 70 so I was very happy. The Cult was a bit of a blind purchase, the store owner played a song for me to see if it liked it and I did. So I purchased it and loved the rest of the album </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Interesting

But for those wondering I managed to come across this is a job lot of 175 vinyl, I had suspicions from the title of the song but believe it was probably a coincidence then when I listened to it I was pleasantly surprised. So it is now the latest addition to my Green Day (and Green Day related) collection. </TEXT>
