	<TEXT> Stuff like this happens to thin people too.
 
It took a while to get a diagnosis for my younger sisters GI condition because everyone just assumed that that her problems were caused by an eating disorder and tried to just stick her in therapy. 

We don't blame the doctors because that wasn't a crazy thing for them to think, especially since I struggle with anorexia and it tends to run in families.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a nursing major, and we regularly talk about how obesity is such a HUGE problem in nursing. 

My freshman year we actually had to do assignments where we used MFP and pedometers and wrote reflections on how we could make healthier choices. 
As someone struggling with anorexia I was SO scared of being outed during that assignment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am personally against abortion, but I vote pro-choice because I understand that we don't live in a world where banning abortion is a realistic goal. As someone from a relatively privileged background, I know that I will never fully understand what can drive a woman to make the decision to terminate a pregnancy. I also understand that sadly, we live in a world where many women may see abortion as their only option as the very same people who push to stop abortion seem to stop caring about the sanctity of life once a baby exits the birth canal. Banning abortion won't do anything but further burden marginalized women; to prevent abortions we need to create a system that better helps women prevent unwanted pregnancies, and provides proper support to those who become pregnant whether they want to keep the child or give it up.

	<TEXT> I usually drive because I'm a bit of a control freak and my boyfriend drives like an old lady. 

I grew up in a family where my dad always drove; I don't think I have ever seen my mom drive with my dad as a passenger. While my mom is a completely fine driver and we all trust her, she always lets my dad drive if they are going somewhere together because driving is something that he actively enjoys where she just sees it as a way to get from point 'a' to point 'b'. 

I don't think that this comes from women thinking that they 'can't' drive their male partner, I think it is more that male partners tend to have stronger feelings about driving and a lot of women just couldn't care less.  </TEXT>

Know what things you just need to wait out (colds etc.), what you should make a doctors appointment for (cold that has lasted a really long time, green snot and sinus pressure, signs of strep), what warrants taking a trip to urgent care (sprains, inability to keep down fluids after 24 hours with a stomach bug) and when you should to go to the emergency department (medical emergencies)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey ladies! 
I am got a summer job as a camp counselor, so I need to get a "work appropriate", speedo style swimsuit! 
 
I'm having a bit of trouble because it seems like each part of my body needs a different size; I basically have the body of a 13 year old boy (no hips or butt), but I have big boobs (I wear a 28F or 30E), and a 24 inch waist. I'm also on the tall side (5'8'') and I get a decent amount of height from my torso but I only weigh 120 pounds. As you can see, my body makes no sense. 

I'm cool with a suit that just smooshes my boobs down, but I'm concerned about them spilling out of the top or sides of the suit.

We ended up getting back together after 6 months of being best friends, and we are still really happy together.

	<TEXT> I am so, so sorry that you have had such a rough time, and I really hope that you are able to accept your diagnosis and get the help that you need, because eating disorders are SERIOUS and you can be suffering at any weight. You ended up in the hospital, and these days they don't admit people unless they really need to be there; if people who have spent the majority of their adult lives studying the human body are telling you that you are sick, it is probably a good idea to listen. 

Starvation impairs your cognition; it causes cerebral atrophy (your brain literally shrinks) so between that and the eating disorder you are not able to think clearly or rationally right now, that is just a fact. In order to do the emotional work that you need to heal, you need to normalize your intake so that your brain has the nutrients that it needs to work properly. 

I can promise you that there will never be a time when you feel like you are thin or sick enough to justify getting better; you need to take a leap of faith and allow yourself to be taken care of physically before your denial kills you, because it will kill you. 

I just want to give you a hug right now </TEXT>

I am sure that my views will change, but I'm only 19, so chest hair is still very much something that I associate with men my dad's age as most guys my age are just starting to get hairy.

	<TEXT> A lot of things can happen that will push a doctor behind. 

You have a kid come in for a normal physical and when you are examining them you hear a heart murmur so you have to get an EKG, educate the family and make a referral to cardiology. 

You have a patient coming in for follow up on a chronic disease, and their lab results look kind of funky, so instead of just asking them how things are going and doing a basic exam you have to do a full head to toe and have repeat labs drawn so you can see if this was just a fluke or if they need to be admitted. 

And then there are the patients who come in for a cold and as you are leaving the room say "oh, so it burns when I pee and I have this rash on my junk, thats ok right"  </TEXT>

What does it even mean to "cure" cancer; we have gotten pretty good at treating a lot of cancers, but they can still come back even after a patient is declared cancer free. We have also made a lot of cancers more survivable; even if we can't completely get rid of the disease, patients are able to live with cancer for a long time and maintain a pretty good quality of life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am also in my second year of college, and I've been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years. 

If you want to wait, that is 100 percent your choice and I respect that, but it should be because YOU want to not because you feel like you have to. 

I'm personally grossed out by the whole "purity" culture; I see sex as an expression of love and I hate that something so beautiful and natural is used to shame young women. 

I personally did not wait until marriage, but I did wait until I was in a longterm, committed relationship with a guy that I love and I feel like that was the right choice for me. Even if my boyfriend and I don't end up married, I don't think that I will regret sleeping with him. 

For me, waiting until marriage seems so arbitrary; especially in our culture where it is common to date for a long time before getting married. I believe that sex is

	<TEXT> I'm 19 and this is my hair is short. 
I've had some variation of the same haircut since I was 16 and I absolutely love it. Cutting off my hair was one of the best things that I ever did for myself and I can't ever see myself going back. 

The style varies because I keep it so short I can change it up a lot without really committing, and I'm really lazy so I'll go a long time between cuts and call it a style.

	<TEXT> For me it was just exposure. I have to get blood drawn almost every week, so I'm fine with it now, but shots still freak me out because I don't get them often so I psych myself out. 

With shots, I do best when they just stick it in without warning, if the person administering it counts down or whatever I have time to start freaking out and tense up, which will make it hurt worse. 

If you are a fainter it could be a physiological response since needle sticks are a super common trigger for vasovagal syncope. Its basically just your body overreacting to a stimulus. When you are stressed your sympathetic nervous system will increase your heart rate and constrict your blood vessels which will lead to an increase in blood pressure. Your body wants to regulate itself, so the parasympathetic nervous system will be activated in response to your elevated blood pressure, and it will dilate your blood vessels and slow your heart rate to get your BP down. In vasovagal syncope, your parasympathetic nervous system does too good of a job and your BP gets too low, so you pass out. 
Fainting actually serves a purpose, as it gets you to a horizontal position, so blood doesn't have to fight gravity to get to your brain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, before we started dating I thought that I was a lesbian because I wasn't attracted to any of the boys in my middle school. Turns out I'm bisexual and can be attracted to men, once they have gone through puberty. 

My boyfriend and I started dating when I was in 10th grade and he was in 11th, and we are still incredibly happy together after close to 4 years.

We have survived him going away to college 4 hours away from home, me having a really severe relapse into my eating disorder, 7 fucking proms, me going to college 10 hours away from home (4 or 5 hours away from his college) and brief "breakup" (we still talked every single day) when I started college because we are too gosh darned rational and felt like we had to because "high school relationships don't last". 

Our relationship is disgustingly healthy, which is impressive since we neither of our parents are the best examples (his parents had an ugly divorce, mine are together but don't particularly like each other). My face still lights up whenever I talk about him, and I truly do think that he is the love of my life. I don't know what is going to happen in the future, maybe we'll be together forever, maybe we won't but I feel so lucky to have been able to spend my formative years with such a kind, caring and intelligent man.

	<TEXT> My first year went really, really well! 
I struggled a fair amount: I developed really severe testing anxiety and ended up in the hospital because of my eating disorder, but I was able to handle these things like an adult and I was still academically successful in my challenging program. 

I think that being 10 hours away from home was really good for me, I overcame a lot of my fears because I had no choice but to do things that made me uncomfortable. School also gave me motivation to continue recovering from my eating disorder. I had a lot of support; I have a therapist at school and had almost weekly doctor appointments to monitor my weight but I stayed compliant because I was so happy at school that I was willing to do anything to make sure I could stay. 

I really surprised myself with how outgoing I was able to be; I tend to be very shy and didn't really have friends in high school so I was worried that I would end up lonely. I went to football games and frat parties and flirted with boys- all things I never thought that I would do. 

If I could have done anything differently, I would have worked on my study skills more in high school! I never had to study to do well in high school, even in my AP classes my idea of "studying" was skimming my notes for 45 minutes the night before an exam. I did well, but I think this year would have been a lot easier if I didn't have to spend time learning how to study.  </TEXT>

I don't think that masturbation is inherently sinful, but it has the potential to be sinful, like most other activities. 

I do masturbate with some regularity (probably a few times a month) and I generally feel the urge pretty easy to resist.   I don't have a high sex drive so while masturbating is enjoyable when I do it I could just as easily abstain completely.
