	<TEXT> I was just listing my *actual* music preferences to establish that I am *not* an Adele fan, I like that *one song*. 

And I absolute hate Justin Bieber, his songs make my my ears want to commit suicide. But hey, his music makes a lot of people happy, so my opinion doesn't mean it's shitty, it just means I don't like it.

And for the record, I do not enjoy Starbucks in the least.

Have fun living your life being a pretentious asshole and thinking your sooo fucking special because you like "real music", not like plebs like me who listen to modern sounds. I hope you feel better about yourself now that you've had an argument with some random internet stranger over something as petty as music taste, you really showed me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She's not who I look for for meaning. I like that *one* song. And I don't like the musicality of classic rock, but I do appreciate the meaning. I usually listen things like Sleeping with Sirens ("Sometime you have to fall before you fly" "Can't promise that things won't be broken, but I swear that I will never leave") Bring me the Horizon ("You could drag me through hell if it mean to could hold your hand") Pierce the Veil ("My love for you was bulletproof but your the one who shot me") Panic at the Disco ("These words are knives hat often leave scars") and such. 

Oh, and whether music is GOOD is not determined by your close-minded view, but by whether or not it makes people happy or helps them in anyway.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only feel hostile towards the fat people who are hostile towards me. Like the ones who say shit like "Real women have curves", "Fuck those stupid skinny bitches", and "Real men want a woman with meat on her, only dogs go for bones". If a person's going to insult my body, I'm going to give it back. Whenever an overweight person tells me "Go eat a Big Mac" I will say "Go eat a salad with a light dressing on the side". When one tells me I'm too skinny for anyone to ever want me, I will tell them they are too fat for anyone to ever want- "No one wants your bones poking them in bed"..."Nobody wants to be crushed under your fat folds in bed". 

If a person wants to be unhealthy and die an early death, that's their choice. But if they think that gives them the right to talk shit about my healthy weight I will show them what it feels like.  </TEXT>

It's sad really. Feminism started out as such a good thing. I have so much respect and admiration for the original feminists, the ones who fought for equality, not domination and superiority.  </TEXT>

They kind of have the perfect opportunity. All alone with the patient, and they really don't often have to worry about being caught because 1) if you're dealing with mental patents it can't be hard to convince people they are lying if they do try to speak up and 2) nobody is expecting that. Nobody arrives to a treatment facility thinking "Holy shit, I'm gonna get violated" so nobody's going to be on guard and ready to defend themself and 3) who's going to believe that a person who's occupation is to help people, dealt such harm?

No one has any right to tell a another human being what they can and cannot do with their body.

	<TITLE> I was sexually assaulted by a female psychiatrist </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-12 09:20:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Remorse]: If you feel bad

A year and 4 months ago I was sexually assaulted after being involuntarily admitted into a treatment center for eating disorders. I didn't get there until very late at night and I was immediately taken to a room after being weighed. Soon a female psychiatrist came in and shut the door behind her. This made me nervous, especially because I had previously been abused in different ways by a different woman for years so I've always been very uneasy around them, but of course everyone assumes that because I'm a woman myself I'll be more comfortable with other women, but it's bullshit but they do it anyway. 

She sat in a chair by the bed and started asking basic questions to get necessary information but then the questions became very inappropriate things to be asking... and then she pinned me down and...did it. Ruined me. Violated me. Touched me and viewed my body in intimate ways that nobody ever should without my permission. 

And I didn't do *anything*. I swatted her hand away *one time* when she initially went to grope my chest and that's it. I just let her do it. I couldn't even really process what was happening and then I was naked and then she had touch me and then it was too late. 

I lost all of my value as a person so quickly. My body doesn't even belong to me anymore. 

I cried and screamed for so long, my arms and legs wrapped tightly around a pillow, trying to get rid of the feeling of exposure. I was threatened with sedation. So then I just started rocking back and forth and repeating "It didn't happen it didn't happen it didn't happen it didn't happen" over and over again...

Now I'm used and impure and I can't stand living in my filthy body. I have flashbacks and nightmares and I can't handle anything anymore. 

And I never reported it. She could hurt somebody else like that because I'm a fucking coward. 

So that's my confession. My first sexual experience was an assault forced upon me by someone who should have helped me and I didn't do anything to protect myself or the people she might hurt next.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So...a year and 5 months ago I was sexually assaulted by a female psychiatrist while I was in a treatment center for my eating disorder. I feel a lot of shame because my body was violated and touched and viewed against my will and now I'm impure and it kills me a little everyday that that monster *knows my body* in such intimate ways. 

This has ruined my life. It ruined my relationship, my self-esteem, my happiness...I cry everyday and things as simple as laying down to go to sleep trigger flashbacks. I can't even take a shower without freaking out. I can't stand seeing my soiled body. I can't even handle sitting without my arms crossed over my chest. 

And it's so inconvenient and terrifying to be afraid of other females because people always assume that just because I'm a woman too I'll be more comfortable with them. I was forced to see a female therapist, female doctor, everything and it was awful. Going into public restrooms is nearly impossible because obviously it's full of other women. 

My ex, (who broke up with me because I wouldn't stop complaining about what happened) told me that it didn't matter when I tried to tell him about it. He said it was basically "a brush on the shoulder" and that because I wasn't fully raped it's nothing. It was very crushing to hear that so I'm so scared to tell anyone else. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to handle this. I hate myself everyday for not fighting, for not stopping it from happening and because my body doesn't even belong to me anymore. 

I just needed to get it out in a place where I won't be judged and invalidated. Thank you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The majority of my family, my mother and father, grandparents, great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, second cousins, were (and most still are) Jehovah's Witnesses. My parents forced my brother and I to attend the "meetings" (they couldn't call it mass, no, they're too special for that) until I was 12 and he was 14 and we just started refusing.

I never believe it for a second. Any of it. I always saw problems in the logic. God is a loving, forgiving man. But God would also strike down a person simply for loving someone if the same gender as theirself. That made no sense to me. God loves everyone the same. But God orders all women to "be in subjection" to all male peers. 

The Witnesses follow a very homophobic religion full of mysogyny and hate speech. I don't stand for that. 

I am a bisexual pro-choice female, so why the fuck would I want to be a part of a religion that tells me my very existence is a sin? That my job is to do nothing but bear children and raise them in the lord under a husband (who would have been chosen by my parents) who would treat me like an animal? Why would I want to be part of a religion that constantly tells me that just being a female makes me inferior and weak and that I need guidance by and to be controlled by a man so I don't "give in to the desires of the flesh" like the weak, stupid woman they want me to believe I am? 

It is just a toxic environment. So much shit goes on within their ranks. They do things like refuse to allow those who are being abused by a spouse  to get a divorce, because that would be sin (but it's totally fine to beat on your spouse, but only if your a man), they encourage hitting kids, they talk about gay people the way a normal person would talk about Jeffery Dahmer, they treat women like incompetent, unstable things that cannot survive without being held on a man's leash. 

They do things like tell us reading Harry Potter is a sin, that dressing in anything that will catch attention is a sin, talking to people who aren't Witnesses unless absolutely unavoidable is a sin, using birth control pills is a sin, tattoos are a sin, piercings are a sin, abortion is a sin (even if you were raped or will likely die in childbirth or something they would still disfellowshipped you), receiving blood transfusions is a sin, getting a collage education is a sin (because all you should be doing is the pioneer work, preaching door to door)...it is full of such things like that.

According to them I will be struck down forever when Armageddon comes just for wearing shorts, having dyed hair, donating blood, supporting reproductive rights, not considering gender as a factor when choosing a partner, and watching Black Butler. Yep. That is why I left. It is full of bullshit and flawed logic, homophobia and misogyny.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to bring up my childfree stance in a new relationship? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-28 21:59:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So...I recently started dating someone new after a break up with my best friend who I have to come realize is not meant to be anything more than that- just my best friend (ok, so technically he was the one to realize it and break the romantic things off, but it didn't take long for me to realize we are better friends than lovers too).

So he introduced me to one of his other friends and we really clicked. I really think I could fall for this guy. He's so good to me and he's endlessly patient and kind. I want it to work. But how do I make it clear that I never want to have children, ever? I want to get it out of the way soon, before I get too attached to him in case he's not ok with my choice, but how? I'm worried it will seem like I'm coming on too strong if I bring up (a lack of) future children but I'm also worried about coming to love him only to find we won't be compatible. 

How can I bring it up in an effective but not weird way? I know I need to tell him but should I wait? Or should I do it soon like I originally thought?

I'm also really anxious about this because it was one of the reasons myself and my used-to-be-SO friend realized we couldn't work like that. He wants a child someday, I obviously do not. When I told him this (stupid me waited until we'd been together for 2 years before bringing this up) he unleashed a string of bingos upon me and totally invalidated my stance. I'm worried that will happened again.  

Any advice as to how to tell my new SO I never want children would be truly appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So...my Nmother just gave me and my brother one present each for Christmas Eve...and when I opened mine I found something I had specifically said I *didn't* want when she showed me a picture of it a couple weeks ago and suggested it. It was just very frustrating because she totally ignored that I said I didn't want it and just got it anyway and then got pissed when I wasn't thrilled to tears upon opening it. 
But is that even really wrong of her? She says I'm an ungrateful bitch for not appreciating it...but I told her ahead of time when she suggested it that I didn't want it. It feels like she's right though, that I'm wrong for not being happy about it even though I said I wouldn't be before it had been purchased. 

So yay me, I ruined Christmas because I wasn't happy about receiving something I had clearly said I didn't want :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, it can go both ways. But not in extremes. Obviously if you have a BMI of like 13 that's not natural and there is must be a medical reason, extreme hyperthyroidism, anorexia nervosa, something. Same if you have a BMI of like 38. Maybe hypothyroidism, binge eating disorder. Neither of those are natural. However somebody could just naturally have a BMI of 17 or another of 26. That's just a slight variation that can be attributed to body type. That's all I meant.  </TEXT>

Sounds like the author has a very unhealthy relationship with food and doesn't even realize it, so she thinks her friend is abnormal for not using food as a coping mechanism for her problems.

Now, I actually had anorexia. If I had explained my dieting technique to a doctor I would have been immediately hospitalized, taking into account I had a BMI of 14 that I had for several months, but of course because I *actually have the mental disorder* I didn't want help (as is the norm with most anorexics). She's clearly just a wannarexic who wants the attention and sympathy you can get out of it. If you tell a doctor you eat 500 calories one day and then fast the next day and repeat that or that you eat only one handful of nuts, a slice of lettuce, and a diet coke everyday, for example, they are not going to encourage it. She's bullshitting.   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-12-18 06:18:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since my recovery from my eating disorder I've gained a lot of weight. From 67 pounds to 98. This is a big thing for me. It changed my body type a lot, not just my size. I feel gross and unfeminine and I hate my body. I was curvier then. I had a (very small but proportionally correct) hourglass figure. Now I am shaped like a chubby child. I've honestly never wanted to get better, I just deal with this shit so my SO won't be worried about it. Because what I want doesn't matter right? Bleh.

So anyway. My Nmother is *always* getting in little jabs about my body type. She tells me things like "You know, if you ate just a liiiiiitle more, you might actually have an ass" or "Maybe if you weren't so skinny (she always says that word like it has a bad taste) maybe you'd have more boobs." It's really painful to hear things like that because I've been trying so hard to stop binging. I eat so much it hurts and then she says things like that. I feel so unfeminine and she points it out. She's always telling me I'm too skinny and that I "need more meat on me" even though for my height and body type my weight is perfectly fine (expect that it makes me feel worthless). 

She shames me in other ways too. She's always accusing me of being a slut. And a few weeks ago I was complaining my side hurt really bad and she asked in such a rude condescending tone "You're not pregnant are you? I wouldn't put it past you."

She scolded me when she found out I'd been talking to my best friend again. She makes me feel like shit. 

Why does she think it's ok to mock my body?  </TEXT>
