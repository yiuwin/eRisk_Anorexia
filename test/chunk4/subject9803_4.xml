	<TEXT> Though I agree that the comic is sensationalized, the idea that an artist should be making work soley for the reward of making art, without the financial incentive perpetuates the stereotype of a "starving artist" which further diminishes the value that society puts on artist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well if you asked them, and they don't know what it is, then i'd assume they don't have it. 

alot of the time to get specialty paper you have to order them in, If you live close to a University, their bookstore may have a art department, which might have a selection of specialty papers. if there is an locally owned art supply store, you could inquire with them about if they can do special orders (theres a store 2 towns away from me that doesn't keep X in stock, but if i ask them they can add it to their next order so i don't have to worry about shipping costs) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Think to yourself, would I buy this for $X. would you buy it for 20, would your buy it for 40? Personally i think i'd put it around a 20 dollar range, IT SOLD OUT THE FIRST DAY? well then next time jack it up to 30. it didn't sell so hot? maybe 25 will be a happy medium. Its all about testing the waters. are there people around that are also selling prints? what are they selling simularly sized/ detailed prints for? take this into consideration.

Pricing is also a strange thing that kinda of sets the value of your work.... now that might seem obvious, but your set up a this crawl, and you put a 500 dollar price tag on your work, or a 25 dollar tag on your work, that 500 dollar tag might get scoffed because someone might think its overpriced (sorry i don't think your print is worth 500), but it might get more attention for the more high brow crowd due to its price point. where as the same piece with a 25 dollar price point might be brushed under the rug because its assumed its student work or something of the like. just like this crawl, if your piece is in a Fine Art gallery, the 500 price point is more likely to be understood/ expected, where as if the same piece is in a coffee shop the 25 is more expected. Its really stupid and assinine, but its part of the Business side of art. 

 I sell my work quite affordably, i usually range from 20-60 dollars. now the last fair i was at, there was another printmaker, who was ok, not great, but he sold his work for 600-3000 dollars. And i the thing is, he could sit in his booth all day and make 2-3 sales and make just as much, probably even more, that me even though i made 100 sales.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Official Post: 1st Annual Hand Printed Holiday Card Exchange </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-13 21:23:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys so quite a few people thought the card exchange would be a cool idea and would be interested in participating. So this is what i'm thinking would be the simplist way about it. 

1) everyone makes 10 Cards. The card when folded should fit into a 7.5"x5.5" envelope (a standard card would be 7"x5"). I think it would be best if they were a solid edition, but you can do whatever you want. you can use whatever medium you want as long as you do it by hand (ei: no straight digital prints please), just have fun, and make something that you'd think would be cool to get as a Holiday card. 

1.a) Don't post images of your card until you get package back. I'd rather people be surprised when they open up their collections. I could post a album of all the cards a week after i ship them out (again, don't want to ruin the surprise for anyone who hasn't got them yet). 

2) everyone ships those 10 cards to me no later than November 28th, we could do it where everyone ships 1 card to each person, but i think that having a "hub" would simplify things. So after i got them, i'd ship each person 10 different cards. along with 10 envelopes. Since i'd be shipping/ supplying envelopes, i was thinking about charging something like $10 per person to cover costs (no i'm not trying to rip you off, just things cost money), which if you guys wanted to ship to everyone individually we could get around that.

3) about one week later i'll ship out each one of you a pack of 10 cards! 

i really have no idea how many people are even going to sign up, i doubt it'll be that many, but if its slightly over 10 but under 20 it might be cool if we upped the edition size to the number of participants so that way everyone could get a card from everyone. 

If your interested, comment here (don't just like a comment) so i can gauge how many people are interested. 

If your 100% interested send me an email at ToddHerzberg@Gmail.com and i'll send you an address to ship the cards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess this is kinda my way of looking at it. as an artist your style is what makes you you. its what defines you as an artist. Relatively anyone can be good at drawing, most of the technical skill demonstrated in any work of art can me copied a decent "artist". but its the personal style that takes the longest to develop, its something that has taken the artist years to evolve. people look at their work and can be inspired by it, can be influenced by it, take parts of it and make it their own, but then some just come out, and straight rips it off thats really hack shit. 

Lets just take a regular person as a non art example. now if you have a friend, whose name is Kevin. Kevin notices you have a cool shirt, and then he gets the same shirt, no big deal, Kevin is just coping one thing. but then Kevin starts coping more and more of your wardrobe, ok thats kinda wierd but you let it slide. now Kevin is stealing your mannerisms, he's coping your likes and dislikes. your getting real annoyed now. You go out to an event, someone comes up to you, and says "Man that shirt is totally Kevin" you try to explain that you were dressing this way before Kevin, they don't really believe you, soon everywhere you go people confuse you for Kevin/ think your ripping off Kevin. Don't you think you'd get annoyed of someone that did that? then why shouldn't Daniel Danger get annoyed?

	<TITLE> Ideas to Liven up this sub </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-12 18:07:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello printmakers,

So I was just thinking that it would be cool if we could work on livening up this sub a little bit. I don't know if anyone else would be interested, but heres a couple things i was thinking of

having quick (say 1-2 week) print challenges. nothing complicated just like have general theme given on monday and everyone make a small print based on it by the next monday, wouldn't have to be the best print ever, just think it could be cool, I might be willing to ship some kinda prize to a winner (Ei: a shirt, or some stickers or small print, etc)

maybe a small print exchange. i mean this could be really simply since i doubt it would be huge, but lets just say start with a holiday card exchange, everyone makes 5-10 cards, ships them to me (with a couple dollars for return shipping) and i'll ship you back 1 an edition of all the other cards.

These are just 2 ideas, let me know what you guys think / if you'd be interested / if you have any other ideas

	<TEXT> Like others posted, start with a dick blick order. I'd grab

(1) battle ship grey linoleum: it's what I've used for about 5 years and I like it 

(2) speedball lino cutter: it has 5 tips to it cost less than 10 bucks, there are better tools, but again, I've been using those for about 5 years and I like it. 

(3) small cheap brayer: get whatever one/ size you want. If your starting small, just get something small. A small speedball brayer will do to just fine. 

(4) biggest choice for you is ink: oil based vs water based. Oil is what I use, richer colors longer working time, thus longer dry time, but since it's oil harder to clean up. Water based I've never used, so I can't really comment in its quality

(5) if you are hand printing your going to want to use a thinner paper Japanese papers would probably be ideal, it's much harder to transfer the ink with hand pressure if your paper is to thick. 

(6) your buren:  now you can go buy an official printmaking buren which isn't to expensive, or you can just use a spoon. What I'd recommend is going to a Asian market/ store and getting a bamboo rice spoon with a flat bottom, they're only like 1-2 dollars and the flat bottom make them much easier to work with than the rounded bottom of a spoon. 

(7) shirts: so I don't know how successful handrubbed shirts will be, but my advise: Get an can of Gamblin's Drive By Black. Google "drive by black" and watch them print a shirt, there are slight variations that come with shirt printing, and they go over most of them.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From their FB post: 
Well, we have bad news and good news. The bad news is that due to our 90% chance of thunderstorms, Night Market won't be happening on Bryan Ave. The good news is that the fine folks over at the Bread Box are letting us move it there! Vendors will be at the Plantory, beer and food at West Sixth Brewing and Smithtown Seafood, plus Chef Mikey Catering Co. outside! It's our first off-site Night Market!

Since it will be in the middle of a residential neighborhood, we ask that everyone strongly consider taking alternative transportation methods - bike, walk, Lextran buses or ColtTrolley, Lyft, or Uber!

	<TEXT> yah, so they don't need to be cured, just dry and good to go. The first round of shirts I made faded real bad, looked into it a bit, and I was printing them the same as is they were paper, so I had to modify how I was inking. Second round I used straight gamblin ink, it faded a little bit, but not really much. I've washed it about 5 times now, and it seems like it's good. Round 3, switched to Gamblin's drive by black, let em dry. Washed em, and they didn't really fade at all. Maybe very minimally, but they seem to be holding up really well. I've been washing them cold (that's what the actual shirts call for). I mean I've only been at this for about a month and a half so I can't tell you how they'll be after 50 washes but they seem just fine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I think your technical printing ability is excellent. Your registration is good. But your drawing needs some work. In an image like when you are using hand drawn imagery, superimposed onto a realistic (though modified) background it polarizes the quality different in the subjects. In you last post it was photo images imposed on photo images, and it made sense, everything seemed to exist in a similar plane  but here they seem disjointed. The lack of a shadow under the figure makes him seem unconnected. The super crisp lines of the pentagram Vs the more sloppy/ fuzzy body of the goat man just seem strange. Also in the previous post the pattern created an overlap on the subject and background which made them seem more cohesive, here I feel like it is very much more flat/ is a clear separation between background layer and foreground subject/layer.

	<TEXT> Thanks, 

process is pretty simple, draw out the guy, carve him out, cut him/the background off of the piece of lino (i hate chatter, so i make my block just what i want to print), cut the background off of him, ink figure up black, place on press, ink up background in red, place on press around him, put shirt with news print inside on top, put board on top, crank dat press, let dry, and VOILA! you have a shirt. So I do like the white outline stylistically, but it also serves as a bufferzone for cutting the pieces apart/ fitting them back together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I think the hardest part of doing all of it yourself would be getting things accurate/ precise. I mean you could probably carve a block, and carve out a a slightly larger negitive on another but it'd be impressive to get everything to line up. If you want to emboss prints you could just blind emboss your paper on a press ( thought it's not as fast as squeezing some tongs) Why not design your logo/ design yourself, carve it (or w/e you do), print it, scan it, take it into Ai or some other program live trace it and then have these fellows.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice print, my only critique is the noose.  when it comes out of the beak. It seems like it just awkwardly comes straight down, if this was my print, i would have the rope come out of the side of the birds beak, have a little bend in the rope when would make it seem more part of the image rather than just an un attached afterthought. Just my 2 cents. And good luck on this exam of yours. 

Edit, just looked at this again, and said aloud, "man that registration is on point." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So i don't think i see enough Critiques on here. I think they're very helpful in the growth/ development as an artist, so heres my critique of these 4 pieces. 

#1 the boat is by far my favorite out of this collection, it has a very nice balance between antique and modern. although its an old ship that could have sailed at the time of the map the printing method makes it seem fresh. the rainbow roll is lovely, and texture overlay on the boat silhouette is a really nice touch. nice job. 

#2 has some nice textures, i expecially like the area with the brown fairly geometic circles overlapping the more organic forms, i feel like this could be pushed farther, right now, i feel like it feels slightly more hap-hazard, but thats just my opinion

#3 Honestly, in every print class i've ever been in i've seen at least 1-5 samurai prints. again in my opinion they're very kitschy, unless something about them is done very differently/ modern-esque. unless you actually doing something reinventive/ semi original with them they'll get lost in the swarms of other samurai prints. that being said, its fairly well done. 

#4 although i see what you did, it seems like the 2 images are fairly unconnected visually. I think that although a 7 layer screen print is technically impressive it isn't entirely needed here. i think it would have served you better to maybe incorporate some of the colors from the bomb into the detenator. or overlap some on the imagery. right now it feel more like object A) bomb-- object B) detenator -- object C) backround instead of simply being one image. and although thematically they are make sense together, i think you need to work on visually tieing them together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It might, dunno how much pressure it'll give off, but it's possible. If that doesn't work, you can do it by hand. Use a thinner paper (Japanese papers work well) put it on top of the inked block, then use the back of a wooden/bamboo rice spoon (or other flattish spoon) they also have water based inks relief if you don't want to use oil based stuff (oil is harder to clean, but is often richer in color, and takes longer to dry)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So those backgrounds are all from the same block. It's a 2 color 1 layer print. So all I did was the figure, cut that outa the block, cut those yellow pieces off the original block, ink them up at the same time, then puzzle piece it back together on the press. It was a total pain doing this one it's 9 pieces, and just took forever to do because of that. If you have a reliable registration method it'd probably be faster/ easier to do with 2 layers, but I had to have this done by this weekend for an Big art fair I'm in so I did it this way, plus it saves linoleum :) 

As for the shirts I'm using gamblin relief ink, I'm experimenting with some things but they're not 100% yet. Gamblin makes a fabric relief ink "drive by black" problem is I want to be able to print color too so that why I'm doing it on my own. Think I'm gonna have to get some cobalt drier and add a little of that into my inks, I hear that helps.  </TEXT>
