	<TEXT> My smile quickly faded into a very concerned look. "If finding a dollar corresponds to stabbing your toe...", I thought, while holding my lottery ticket,"then.. what does this mean?".

   I quickly snapped out of my thoughts and began preparing for the worst. I hid the lottery ticket inside a locked drawer, I boarded up all of my windows, I locked all my doors. If something was going to kill me, it would have to get through all my defenses.

   I then proceeded to sit on my couch and watch the  news. Suddenly, I felt hungry. I got up and stretched as my stomach began to rumble. I slowly walked towards the kitchen, where I remembered having placed a bag of chips on the counter. I grab the bag and begin to walk back to the living room where my couch was located.

  Suddenly a thought of dread came upon me. It almost felt like I was about to experience this ultimate payback for my lottery winning. My heart raced as I walked back into the living room. Then ,"BANG!". I had stubbed my toe.

-This was my first writing prompt story. Hope you like it! Any feedback is encouraged!

	<TEXT> Hi reddit. Im going to Disneyland next month and I'm going with a big group of family and friends. Things can get chaotic when theres a lot of people and I'm afraid we'll waste the weekend we're at the parks. I've never really gone in a big group before and I'm a bit nervous. Any tips for still enjoying the experience while in a big group? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Info about House of Blues Replacement. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-03 06:22:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a friend who recently got a job bartending at Catal in downtown disney. Every once in a while he overheards conversations from imagineers and disney execs who are eating at Catal. Recently, he told me he found something out that nobody (from what I have seen) knew about. Basically, when at his bar, my friend heard a couple Disney executives talking about the House of Blues and what would be replacing it. My friend didn't tell me much but he said that the execs said that it would be replaced by a bowling alley/restraunt thing. 

Take this with a grain of salt because I have no idea if my friend was lying. Although I'm fairly certain he wasn't, you can never be sure. A bowling alley woudn't be that weird considering Downtown Disney has a cinema. I hope this will spark some speculation. Although it isn't a super interesting topic, I still liked sharing it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sorry for the vague title, but there is some serious speculation going on. Disney has confirmed that they will be making a new parking structure. However, if the Toy Story parking lot still remains after the new parking structure is built, it wouldn't need to really exist anymore. That is a LOT of land which could possibly fit a small new park. It's a stretch, but if they do make a new park, what do you think its theme should be?
