	<TEXT> He was apparently terrible away at Huddersfield (in the context of an awful all round team performance) 

He was very good against Charlton, but it's hard to tell because they were - frankly - abysmal. His crossing was excellent though, and he worked ridiculously hard, which is always a good sign.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Transfer fees for the buying club are accounted for in one hit - the cash is irrelevant. The example someone's put up there is quite good - if a player is bought for, say, 5mn on a 5 year deal on 100k a week, the actual annual hit in terms of profit   loss is 6mn - 5mn in wages, 1mn amortised transfer fee. 

edit: that said, I don't really understand how Fifa then give a club a limit on their spending in one year, unless a different kind of P L is prepared showing total spending in fees in the year or some such? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, it's not as if the players set out to fail; there wasn't a huge amount of investment, as there wasn't really the money available. Key players (Richard Johnson, Nicky Wright, Allan Smart, Tommy Mooney, Gifton Noel-Williams) all missed large parts of the season. We were essentially playing a squad which had been in division 2 / league 1 two seasons previously. It wasn't until Man United destroyed us in about ten minutes in mid-November that our season fell to bits. 

We had one goal losses to Liverpool at home. Bradford away (in which fat cheat Dean Windass dived to win a penalty),Wimbledon at home, Man Utd at home, Spurs at home....the list goes on. Stupid fine margins that the points tally really doesn't tell the tale of.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably the game where I scored the only two goals in my Sunday league career.  It was the first season for the team I was playing for and having started the season as a right back, I was replaced as starter and having had a reasonable substitute runout as a one paced right midfielder, the manager decided to start me. In the first half, I made a run to the penalty spot, and side footed in a cross, and then about ten minutes later made a run to the front post and bundled it in to make it 2-0. Never matched that epic 45 minutes again,  really.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Er, at some point in tbe late fifties or early sixties,  having previously worn black and white then blue, it was decided to change the club colours to yellow, red and black to stand out, and the Hornet was adopted as the club badge. In the seventies, with the arrival of Graham Taylor,  he insisted that the club badge be something more professional than a cartoon hornet,  at which point,  the current crest which features the head of a "hert" or male stag was adopted. The hert reflects the clubs position as (at the time) the only league club in the county, something which persisted until Stevenage were promoted a few years back.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spurs are being Spurs. What do you expect?  Arsenal will turn it round and finish fourth. Liverpool are struggling because their two most important players from last season have barely played (Suarez and Sturridge), and they can't defend. I'm not convinced the return of Sturridge will turn it round,  to be honest though. You just can't replace a genius like Suarez, even if he does need muzzling. </TEXT>

More specifically, a maniac who runs the Twins into the ground. 

Probably helps having a half decent third   fourth line though. 

It's not just the Lou trade; getting rid of a demotivated Kes   replacing him with a couple of players who actually want to perform probably helps.

That said, I saw him give a speech once about his daughter who's deaf, and it was wonderful. I think you need to seperate his gooby football persona from his other side.  </TEXT>

That said, McGugan can bugger off. He's nowhere near as good or important to this team as he thinks he is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We don't particularly want to sell him, so have refused every offer so far. If clubs want to make those offers, great. Hardly our problem. We're now, financially, in a position where we don't have to sell our best players. 

Out of curiousity, how much do you think a player who's scored over 40 goals in the last two seasons is worth? 

Edit: I'm not saying Troy is worth 12mn but it's a free market, and it's up to us to decide an acceptable amount to decide to let him go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funnily I'm publishing an entire XI of youth team products who never quite made it later today. Best for me was Gifton Noel-Williams.  Youngest ever goalscorer, had 14 goals by January in his debut division 1 (now championship) season before an appalling tackle by Sunderland's Paul Butler (as revenge for the minor wondergoal GNW had just scored) destroyed his knee at 18 and he ended up with arthritis in it. He never really recovered from it. His son is now working his way through our youth set up. Hopefully he makes it.

	<TEXT> For a start, Il Duce didn't lead them into the war until 1940 when he felt it was clear that the Axis were going to be the winning side, and I guess the fact they were so *stunningly* incompetent means that they get something of a free pass. 

I've always felt that although obviously their actions in the run up to the war (Invasion of Abyssinia, arming Franco   supplying troops) certainly helped the gathering crisis, Mussolini has always been presented as a kind of slightly more friendly fascist than Hitler - didn't seem as involved in the Holocaust but also, I suppose, he doesn't really feature on a level of evil as Hitler did.

	<TEXT> Well, I think the evidence more or less points to that being less likely to happen. I'm not an expert on Forest, but I know that on our promotion in 1982, Graham Taylor added a couple of players and we finished second. In order to achieve that now, a club would need to invest *millions*. It's just not possible. Still want to get promoted, mind. 

The franchise system works for the MLS,   that's great. They shouldn't be forced to conform if they've got a successful system that helps to attract investors in a way they're comfortable with.  </TEXT>
