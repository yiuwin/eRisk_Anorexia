	<TEXT> I had an extra pass for SDCC last year (2014) that was free (thanks to my cousin) and I ended up offering to give it to Matt Lieberman (a host at SourceFed) since he had never been to Comic Con and didn't have a pass even though a bunch of people from the company had passes. So I gave it to him (free of charge, obviously), and it wound up getting confiscated because the name on it said Monica or something like that. It was a professional badge and he tried to get into the pro-lounge and a convention center employee busted it. The pass that *I* had wasn't even mine (it was my cousin's), so I was scared about getting mine taken too. Turns out it was perfect timing because Matt was about to leave anyway and I didn't have anyone else to give the pass to. So basically, I was really stressed out about the whole thing, but it paid off. Matt and I are now pretty good friends because of this situation. (And no, I did not get my badge confiscated).

**TL;DR: My extra pass that I gave to someone at SDCC got confiscated, but I ended up becoming pretty good friends with the person I had given it to.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a kid who graduated from my school last year whose name was Blade. I also know a girl whose first name is Lucy-Bleu (the last part is pronounced like 'blue') and last name is Knight. I also know a guy named Rakshit (he's Indian), but he goes by Rick. On the cooler side though, I have a friend named Nirvana, which is pretty unusual.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I must've been about 13. I was an early bloomer (I started wearing a training bra half way thru 4th grade and was a C cup by the time I was 13. I was also one of the tallest people in my grade up until 6th). I've worked in the fashion and entertainment industry for almost 5 years now, so I learned that guys were starting to notice me at around the age of 12 or 13. It really hit me when I was walking around at around midnight (I had gotten in a fight with my mom and left to do whatever which was really stupid) and a 40-something-yo Caucasian man in a sweatsuit approached me. I was already kind of scared at that point. He then told me I'm cute and asked my name. I told him my name was Amber (which is not my name), and he said that Amber's a beautiful name. Then he reached out at me and I stepped backward to the point where I was literally backed up against a tree trunk. Then he said, "Don't be scared, little girl." and smiled one of those really creepy smiles. Luckily, at that point, some cars started coming down the road, so he chuckled and said goodnight and walked away. 

**TL;DR: Some pedo freak tried hitting on me when I was 13.**

Edit: I have now learned to say things such as "If you lay so much as a finger on me, I'll fucking break it" and "Wanna say that again? I'll make you piss blood for a week" which usually works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have 2 small dogs, but the one this is about is a yorkie-chihuahua mix named Libby. When I'm studying, watching TV, browsing the internet, etc., I like to keep her on my lap. This dog also loves licking any part of exposed flesh. I love her to death, but this asshole decides to constantly lick me, even though I say no and make it obvious that I'm not about that at the moment. Sometimes she stops, but most of the time, she leaps to lick me. My arm is exposed; lick. I'll pull my sleeve down and then she'll actually sit up from lying down and crane her neck to get my hand. So then I pull my hand away and she tries to jump to lick it. And then if I'm wearing shorts or something, she'll lick my legs. And if I'm totally covered, she'll proceed to lick my clothes...and my chair/couch. And she doesn't do this to anyone else on my family--only me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually only used temporary dye. Like the kind that washed out right away. I was really mad at my mom because she wouldn't let me permanently dye my hair pink. She also wouldn't let me get gauges, which I did at one point, but I ended up getting up to like a size 8 I think.

Edit: My hair is actually dyed platinum blonde now, but I actually go to a hair salon to get it done professionally.  </TEXT>
