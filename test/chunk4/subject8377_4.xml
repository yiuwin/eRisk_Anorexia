	<TEXT> :( damn. I am a nurse, although I work in surgery now and not on the floor. Definitely have a word with the unit nurse or nurse manager in charge, however with that said the nursing system is hierarchical and if upper management is shit, don't expect lower management to be any good. I'm so sorry you are going through this - I've seen my fair share of apathetic nurses. It's a stressful job where you often have to let go of your own humanity just to get by each day what with seeing death and illness all day. Not to mention we're overworked and underpaid. Still though, not an excuse. 

I can understand why some nurses are upset about visitors - it messses up their schedule especially if there is more than one visit a day. Also, be careful about thinking the nurses and doctors are being dismissive. Chances are they have run tests and are investigating issues and expected that there would be fever, I mean, infections usually always lead to fever. Sometimes a lot of the things we do don't make sense to the lay person, but if it's anything like the hospital my friend did her placement at, if they're underfunded and understaffed they will under supply and under medicate due to cost and only act when they feel they absolutely must. Which sucks, but it's happening and governments need to step in and fix this issue. 

I am so sorry about you going through a rough time. Some hospitals have a counselling service that you can contact. Maybe look into that for some in house guidance and support. Best of luck to both you and your partner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Klonopin lasts for 12-24 hours though so I will not be surprised if it was making you feel fatigued through the day. Fluoxetine/Prozac alone made me feel really tired (but not enough to sleep). 

It's funny though. Benzos are rarely prescribed where I am as they are a drug of dependence (a lot of people use them as a recreational drug or become addicted), it's usually only for people who are either at risk of seizures or have very psychotic disorders and often they are in inpatient care. Weird how medical practices vary across countries despite having the same science and diagnostic models. Anyway, good luck on the arduous quest on finding a medication that works well with you. :)  PD is pretty hard to cope with, but just keep practicing your CBT and you'll be right as rain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really unnecessary. That's what the SSRIs are meant to do - keep you calm. Are you seeing a Psych or a doctor? Doctors are not really trained thoroughly in handling psychiatric drugs. Not to mention Klonopin is a benzo, it's addictive and can lead to sexual dysfunction. I find it unusual that it has been prescribed. Usually you only get benzos if the SSRIs are not enough, but you never had them on their own. I'd recommend seeing someone else. I took benzos for a time, but as mentioned I had quite severe PTSD as well. It's left as a last line of defence  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, not being able to cum is not a good reason to quit taking anti-depressants for panic disorder. 6 weeks is when the SSRIs start doing their job, especially for a slow activating drug like Fluoxetine. 

Now, I have panic disorder as well. It's great isn't it. :) I was first put on a drug called escitalopram or Lexapro. It has a diminished effect on sex drive (ie, I was pretty horny all the time), but it made me feel sick (am Asian, apparently Asians cannot metabolise the drug well). So I was put on Fluoxetine which made me so apathetic towards sex and then Zoloft which made it so difficult for me to stay hard. After that I was finally put on a high dose of a drug called citalopram (Celexa) which had been a god send for my panic attacks, depression and my sex life.

The great and shit thing about SSRIs is that there are so many drugs out there. You need to do a little playing around to find a good one. It was a little hard for me because I had comorbid depression and PTSD and was in more than just anti-depressants. But citalopram has been the go to drug for psychiatrists in treating panic disorder. You find some luck there, but like I said. It will depend on how your body metabolises them. I recommend getting a genetic pharmacology test, no idea what they are called, but basically they screen for all medicines for all illnesses to find which will best suit you according to your genetics. It becomes quite useful in the future.

Also, why are you taking Klonopin? If you are still restless and have insomnia despite the SSRI you are on, you need to switch. Citalopram really got me to go to sleep when I should, but Fluoxetine and escitalopram did not. You'll have to have a chat with your psychiatrist over this. </TEXT>

Their behaviour is short sighted. But, it is important to have open dialogue with such people to at least bridge some gaps in understanding. They all believe we are spreading disease, but we have a higher proportion of people who get tested and utilise safe sex compared to straight people and they believe gay people cannot be committed, thinking we only date for sex. They have horrible false stereotypes about us - at least attempting to educate them will lessen the bible beating over time. </TEXT>

It's the guys who think or know they're hot shit who are too up tight and vapid in my experience. They don't understand that there is more to sex or getting a date than to just look good, not to mention they generally seem so much more insecure being fixated on BS like penis size. 

Of course I am generalising. But I have hooked up with guys who I am not attracted to on a physical level, but they just made me want to suck their dick so badly. For example, I am not into fem guys, but some of the people on RuPaul's drag race have such amazing personalities that I find them really sexy. I'm also not into twinks but I have fucked a few because they made me laugh and had amazing confidence. I like to say that having a great personality is a shortcut to my anus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well this brings me way back to PSYC1001. This was commonly a behaviouralist approach to human behaviour and psychology - think B.F Skinner and Steven Pinker who consider humans to be born as (close to) blank slates by which experience determines our behaviours and attitudes.

The modern psychology approach is more biopsychology which is sometimes referred to as cognitive psychology which takes concepts of behavioural psychology, but says that there are inherent innate neurological patterns, preferences and responses as well as genetics which determine outcomes. So depending on which school of thought you like more it either means you are what you experience, or you are what your genetics determine the product of that experience to be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look. I was doing my second masters degree at 23, this kid hasn't even been to college. This doesn't sound temporary imo. He's had 5 years to get his shit together and he hasn't, forget the age and focus on where you are at. You will have much less stress being with someone who is on some equal footing with you whether that is going to college or having full time work. Otherwise, prepare for unnecessary stress </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like if you are still living home and not taking advantage of that by going to college or work, you're in for a rough future. I understand the job market is abysmal. When I was at university I could not land any jobs in retail or the likes for over 3 years! Thankfully I had professional ballet training so I could teach that. I wouldn't be surprised that he can't find stable work - the market is what it is. 

However, unless he can't afford to go to college, he doesn't have an excuse not to go. Personally I could sympathise with someone in his position, but if you're not working full-time or studying full-time, then you are just wasting crucial future building time. I had however been in a similar situation, but my husband had plates put into his back after an accident when he was deployed and was in a wheelchair for over 2 years. He could not work or study for 6 months so I picked up the slack. However, I feel that's a different situation. It's hard though, because being the only breadwinner puts a lot of pressure on you to provide for two people on a one person wage </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope he realises that the 'drama' on RuPaul is mostly editing and TV magic. If you watch, they actually hate when people get catty unless it is very obviously a joke. However, I do feel like Detox and Kim Chi are the only ones who clearly look like they are kidding. You will never get far in drag if your cattiness is not just your act - it's a supportive community of people who generally respect and care for each other. Being a bitch is going to force you solo and unable to bag some good shows. 

To me, it sounds like he's projecting how he thinks he should act like, rather than how he should act. Drag is an act, it's not real life. These people have personalities out of drag and I think your friend is really confusing the two. And honestly I wouldn't be surprised if he is using drag as a way to act like a bitch, even though that's really not how it works. 

I think you should at least tell him that he's being caught up in himself and that he's using drag as a means to get away with the shit he says.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm muscular/toned skinny no matter how much I work out. For some people, it's a genetic thing that determines how much they can bulk up. I was doing the whole protein shakes and heavy weights business, but all it did was strip the fat from my body and made me look not so great. So really, don't be disheartened if you can't bulk up. Like John said, think of your proportions. If you're a shorter guy you will look better with less bulk than if you were taller. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Um, I am Australian and I have to somewhat disagree with the 'white people have it better'. For the most part, it's fairly equal in Sydney. White people are just wealthier and have more connections because they don't have migrant parents like most of us Asians do.

Getting mad over this won't help. While it is true we get less swipes, I also realised that we are less inclined to get hook ups and more serious or long term relationships. People swipe for white boys because they're a quick shag that they see in porn all the time. I'd say we do have the whitewash of porn to blame for this, and it's not just Asian men, but also women. 

I also find it pretty fucking ironic that so many Asians I know want to fuck white guys. You need to remember, on Grindr/Tinder, people are shopping. There are TONNES of people on this site and most just want to swipe for the hottest person they find. H3H3 did a wonderful video on this, he swiped until he no longer could, and got no swipes at all. 

So if you don't look like a porn star, you won't get any tbh. There is a lot of competition out there. Not to mention, you have a limit of swipes on Tinder. For that, people are going to be super picky on who they can/cannot swipe for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You will be surprised at what will be useless in other countries. Even things like computer science, medicine and health science courses can become redundant. Unless the language course you are studying is accredited by the country's national assessment standard, then it will be useless and you may have to restart your study following their national curriculum. In the case of German, a university course must follow the Goethe-Institut structure and produce the same outcomes, otherwise it's relearning and exams to get a visa.  </TEXT>

Maybe it's because I'm Australian and my experiences may be different. When I was in the US they seemed to celebrate diversity by dividing people - like oh those are the Asians and those are the black people. In Australia, everyone is just blended all together, it feels less segregated.  </TEXT>

But now that westernisation is upon us, we are seeing gay men become more into the kawaii culture, with straight men either abandoning it, do it mockingly or still hold onto it. In the end, just ask him if he's gay. It shouldn't be awkward since you two seem good friends already </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You sound great. :) There are plenty of fat/chubby guys who find love, you have just got to own it and be confident. Your confidence will improve when you find flattering clothes, work out and eat healthier. While I suffered from anorexia, my goal was to put on weight. What really kicked my body dysmorphia was to start working out - I could breathe better, I was getting a more attractive body (sort of) and I just felt better inside. I also cooked. Cook, cook, cook. And I love cooking now. I scheduled in two days of vegetarian/vegan food only and it really got me used to eating healthier and better (before that I was just taking multivitamins, dry biscuits and sugary food). 

I'm not saying this to make you lose weight, but rather a good diet and exercise do help with confidence and feeling better.

If you are dealing with feelings of depression, I recommend seeing a doctor about getting your hands on some SSRIs/SNRIs. It's easy for people to say "hey get confident and socialise more!" but sometimes there is a barrier or illness which gets in the way, when you receive the proper help, then you can start doing those things and will see better results with how people treat you. :) </TEXT>

Edge him. When he's really turned on, either squeeze his dick really hard so it hurts for a while or stop getting him off and just suck and play with his balls. 

Use restraints if you want to or if he wants to jerk off, bite him on the inner thigh or pinch his nipples. This all really depends on what you guys are into and what your limits are. Not sure whether you are the top or the bottom, but as a bottom I like to rub his dick against my asshole to tease him when he's really horny. If he tries to thrust or is impatient I'll stop it and lick slowly up and down his dick. 

But yeah. Have fun. </TEXT>
