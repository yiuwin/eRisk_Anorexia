	<TEXT> I was raised a Larry Bird + Celtic fan and converted my dad to the Spurs when I was 8 years old, so the Celtics always have a spot in my heart. 

Edit: So I just so happened to be reading my "Bird Watching" book that I stole from my dad over a decade ago and I found this passage highlighted: http://i.imgur.com/POMdksX.jpg  

It didn't take to much work to convert him into a Spurs fan. The principals that Larry exhibited were the same as Timmy and the Spurs. He'll still debate me on the greatest passing team of all time, though. I've heard enough about 1986 Boston Celtics for five life times.

	<TEXT> It was like he was trying to explain why it was a boring fight, not defend it, yet he was still defending it. Joe's one of those guys who thinks he's tremendously smarter than he really is and he shows it quite often. Saying that "anything could happen at anytime" doesn't make a boring fight interesting; that's called anticipation. Perhaps his anticipation changed his perception, but it didn't change the actual fight that happened. It's a really weak argument when you're trying to argue for why the fight was good...the rest is him explaining why it's boring. I'm sure he patted himself on the back for proving everyone who thought the fight was boring wrong. I'm sure a lot of people are going to be upset with me on here for being critical of Joe, and I understand that. A lot of people love him here, but to me, there's nothing more pretentious than responding to someone who didn't find something interesting in a matter of preference: "I guess you're not educated enough to know what you were watching then," which is clearly the line Joe is taking. It's a statement that shows that the person thinks they have a monopoly on truth when it comes to something that is purely subjective. It also shows that they find their opinions to be more sophisticated than the majority.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wonderboy's logic and plan was basically this: "If I don't get hit with those couple shots, if a handful of shots don't land, I win the first fight. I have to go out there, do what I did in the first fight, but avoid those few big shots." This was a recipe for boring because Wonderboy wasn't the most entertaining fighter in the first fight. His plan was to be even more careful than the first fight, which was certain to mean that he wasn't going to put on an entertaining fight. At the end of the day, that was why I was more upset with Wonderboy. His plan wasn't to go out and win the fight, it was to avoid losing the fight like he did the first time.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to get a life. You seriously responded to a discussion that was over; one in which you had already responded to a day earlier. It's as if you were still fuming on it, or had to feel like you got the final, final word. I've tried really hard not to be super mean to you, even though you've given me plenty of reasons. This is my last response to you. Stop questioning my love of the Spurs and basketball. It's a dick move. You're not nearly as bright as you think you are. I suggest you check out the Dunning-Kruger effect. Your sentences are full of comma splices and logical fallacies. You've been doing it from the beginning of the conversation. Here is an example from the last thing you posted: 

"Since when have the Spurs had the personnel to be a quick fast break team?"
This question right here leads me to believe a couple things:
1) You don't play basketball. Or haven't grasped the concept that a team that plays at a slow pace still runs fast breaks.

This is called a straw man fallacy. I talked about having the kind of pieces to be a team that is quick, that runs a lot of fast breaks. I then presented the stats that showed we were in the bottom five in fast breaks. You raised up a straw man that was saying a team who doesn't score a lot of fast break points, who's offense comes mostly in the half court setting, can't run a fast break, and can't score quick points. This is ridiculous. You have to be smarter than that. You claim to be an adult, but you don't argue like one. Building a straw man while saying I don't play basketball is childish. 

2) You haven't followed the Spurs for very long.

This is funny, because you obviously don't remember something YOU said. 

I've also been following Spurs for over 20 years.

Which was a response to something I said in the post prior:

The offense has certainly evolved over the last 20 years I've been a fan. 

It's rich. If I had to speculate, I would guess you do things like this because you get angry. You obviously know better. It's not an argument; it doesn't help your case; and it's certainly not indicative of the behavior of a rational, intelligent adult. 

Then you top it off with this:

But I wouldn't expect you to know that, your probably a kid yourself.

Tell me, would an intelligent adult, one which has a great argument, feel the need to accuse someone of creating multiple accounts because he's not getting up-voted, question how long someone's been a fan, question how old that person is, say things like "you don't know what the fuck your talking about," question whether I play basketball, and so on? You do these things all while reminding me over and over that you are an adult and how long you've liked the sport. These are not arguments. You need some self reflection. This is not how an intelligent adult behaves or proves his point. I think you could be a smart person, but clearly anger is an issue that clouds your intellect.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is exactly what I didn't want to do, because you're not going to win this debate that easily, and neither am I...this goes both ways, man. It's also funny how defensive statistics such as steals and blocks are not important statistics to you. You have to realize that shows your bias, and it's not like I am not biased. It's not the TBSA (the best stats award). If it was, Russell Westbrook would win. More points, less turnovers, more rebounds, more steals. He's beating him in every important statistic (of course I had to leave assists out, just like you had to leave out blocks and steals). This debate is far more convoluted than just pulling out statistics, and I think you do know that. There's literally a thread on this every single day. It's getting kind of tiresome because the only thing that is accomplished is elucidating the subjective nature of the MVP award.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A seasons worth of greatness for 4 games of Kawhi being clutch

I see you went with the straw man, nice. My four saved games was more in reference to what Spurs fans are responding to. The excitement has been building for four games and was at a peak last night. If you need someone to explain why Kawhi is in the argument (infinitely better defensive player, possibly more important to his team, better team record, less than half the turn overs, and so on), then I am sorry I didn't do that for you. I thought it was pretty obvious...and after the obvious, this game certainly doesn't hurt Kawhi's case.  </TEXT>

In case you haven't noticed, this is the fourth game **in row** (all the plays have been on the front page) that Kawhi has had a game saving/winning play. If that doesn't refute your one awesome play comment, I don't know what does. The Spurs circle jerk for Kawhi has been building for games and games and this one has it at a peak. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Spurs have traditionally scored most of their points in the half court offense. The Spurs have never been one of the top teams in fast break points. The Spurs have rarely been described as a quick, run and gun team. The Spurs are currently 21st in the league in fast break points. My opinion was that Murray seemed to be a better fit for a quick team, but that I hoped he would wind up being a perfect fit for the Spurs. Also, who knows what the team will look like in a couple years. The offense has certainly evolved over the last 20 years I've been a fan. Man, it's not that serious, calm down.

	<TEXT> A lot of guys were hurt during that 20-62 season. Namely, David Robinson, who only played six games. Sean Elliott only played 39 games. Dominique Wilkins was the leading scorer on the team that season. David played 73 games during the Timmy's rookie season. I think that is worth noting when you look at the records.  </TEXT>

Tyron did what Wonderboy was making him do. When he rushed in, he was getting caught. Wonderboy had him where he wanted him but he had a game plan that did not involve trying to finish the fight. He thought he was going to cruise to victory. His game plan was to be boring, that's why I blame him more. Wonderboy was getting the looks he wanted all fight and did nothing with it. Woodley was being dictated by Wonderboy and still capitalized on his few opportunities to make something happen in a boring ass fight.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He obviously has put work into it. It's not just you and the ball and the rim.  It's you, thousands of people in the arena, loud noise, 9 other players on the court, and pressure. He's altered his mechanics over the years, so you are going to see a change. Consistency is key, but when you're consistently shooting poorly from the free throw line, consistency is not a good thing. It's a vicious cycle.

Another thing you should think about is how much work he's put into his jumpshot over the years. He's a two motion shooter that relies on a tilt when he shoots (look where his hip and legs are before he jumps), so it wouldn't shock me to find out that he's less comfortable at the line.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. LMA was better last year, plus we had Timmy. I think we moved the ball better last year. Timmy was a big part of the team last year, and he was still a very good player. 

Take this into consideration: "In 7 more minutes a game, LMA is averaging the same amount of rebounds, less assists, less steals, less blocks, and a worse field goal percentage than Timmy last year, who was nearly 40 years old....and for triple the money that Timmy was making."

The absence of Timmy shows up in other areas, too. For instance, we were 5th in the league in defensive rebounding last year. This year, we are 18th.  We were 3rd in assists, now we are 8th. We had the 4th rated offense last year, now we have the 6th. The list goes on. Relative to the league, we were better last year.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No chance that he grabs 20 rebounds. Dedmon will grab 20 (and has been closer this season) before LMA does. LMA is not a great rebounder and he's having one of his worst rebounding seasons of his career, just behind his rookie season.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's disappointing when you consider the fact that he makes more money than Boogie and is the highest paid player on the team. Also, some games he just disappears. Ask me in a couple years, because of the bias of watching Timmy for two decades. LMA is not as good as Timmy in any facet of the game and that's obvious every night. 

Edit: In 7 more minutes a game, he's averaging the same amount of rebounds, less assists, less steals, less blocks, and worst field goal percentage than Timmy last year, who was nearly 40 years old....and for triple the money that Timmy was making. 

TL;DR: I think LMA is good. I am glad he's on my team. He is not worth what he's getting paid. I wish he didn't take nights off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His field goal attempts are down, and quite considerably in his first two years in Cleveland. His three point attempts are up. He is spreading the court more and being less of a go to guy in the post. The offense certainly, 100 percent, runs through him less in Cleveland. What's more, who's the other big that plays with him? Wasn't this about two towers mostly (smb bigs)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Over the last few weeks, I have come to wonder if he will be a Spur for a number of years. Currently, I felt like he doesn't fit the system we are running. He wants to run. I see him fitting perfectly in a team that likes to push the ball, which doesn't describe us. With LMA and Kawhi's half court offense, I wouldn't be shocked to see him treated like an asset rather than a future star point guard for the Spurs. Then again, Pop made Tony into a PG that fit within the team dynamics, so I could be wrong. I'd love nothing more than seeing DM become a star on the Spurs. </TEXT>
