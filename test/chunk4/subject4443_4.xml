	<TEXT> It's actually an extremely progressive country compared to the region around it. 

The whole US hates Iran and Iran hates the US comes from the fact that the US installed a Shah in Iran who was ruthless to the people. They had an uprising against him which was lead by their religious leaders and ended up with the progressive region partly getting more religious than before. ( It was actually a pretty modern and progressive country before and still is. )  </TEXT>
