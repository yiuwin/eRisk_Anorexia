	<TEXT> I suffered from depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self harm, all that fun stuff. And the only thing that has truly helped me change and embrace life is to find activities that give me and my life meaning. I got a job and started to go out of my comfort zone and make friends with coworkers. I took up knitting and drawing as it makes me feel good. I journal to get those suicidal and self deprecating thoughts out of my head and onto paper. I read a lot of random quotes. I got tattoos to form some sort of self identity. 

Also, acknowledging the thoughts and not trying to suppress them. Instead, realize they are there and then choosing not to act on anything. Takes awhile to do, but 100% worth learning. Check out some DBT skills and mindfulness may be good too. 

I dunno, man. It's a lot of true, hard working effort. You can't just expect the thoughts to go away, you have to actively work on yourself and your life and finding meaning in anyway you can.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I joined a gymnastics team when I was three years old. My first coach, Russell, moved from gym to gym following me and some of my teammates. When I was about eight, Russell got arrested for molesting children while teaching "at home lessons." My good friend was molested by him as he convinced her family she needed "at home lessons." I am very fortunate that nothing happened to me as a kid, but it makes me sick to my stomach to think that there are people preying on lovers of a sport. This needs a lot more attention.
