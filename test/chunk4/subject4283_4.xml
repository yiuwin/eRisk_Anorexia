	<TITLE> Does Toronto have a Film Industry? (thinking of moving) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-17 18:07:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a 23 year old amateur filmmaker from the UK but in terms of jobs in the city where I live, there isn't much happening on the filming side. My mum lives in Canada and she recently sponsored me and I now have a 5 year working visa. I'm on the fence about moving over as it's a massive step and I also don't know if it'll be wise. Is there a film presence in Toronto? And do you think it's a decent place to live? </TEXT>
