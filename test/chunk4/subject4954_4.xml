	<TEXT> True, but Geddy Lee was absolutely central to the overall songwriting and creative process for Rush, so that's not exactly what I'm thinking of. Still worth noting, though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bands with Lead Singers who didn't contribute to the songwriting? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> A friend and I were discussing this the other day: how rare it is for a band to have a lead singer who isn't a meaningful driver of the creative pulse or direction of the music. Only one perfect example occurred to me, which is Oasis. To my knowledge, Noel Gallagher basically wrote all the music and his brother Liam sang lead.

Of course I'm talking about modern bands, not the super-produced vocal groups of the 60s and 70s, like those coming out of Motown.

What other examples can you think of? I wondered if Van Halen during the David Lee Roth years applied, as I'm not sure how involved DLR was in the songwriting process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good call. I also might nominate Farewell to Kings or Signals. Neil Peart didn't do much writing about love.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A bunch come to mind:

Weezer's debut album. Ziggy Stardust. Brian Eno - Here Come the Warm Jets. Pink Floyd - the Wall. MGMT - Oracular Spectacular </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely sounds like it's clipping somewhere in the signal. The Focusrite has a "Pad" button you could hit if the sound coming out of your amp is too hot. You also might want to try putting a bit more distance between your speaker and the mic if you're getting too much low end (I'm listening on cheap laptop speakers so I can't tell).

Getting a good crunchy amplified guitar sound always takes a lot of trial and error, in terms of amp volume, mic selection and placement, level of distortion coming out of your stomp box (if you use one) and the recording levels.

Keep experimenting, and in the process you'll learn more than anyone here could teach you with their comments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wes Anderson's style is so memorable and contagious, I find it constantly tempting to attempt to mimic him. This is such a nicely executed attempt that I really enjoyed it. 

There's a Utah amusement park that recently did an ad campaign in Anderson's style and pulled it off pretty impressively. Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A59590wS3r8 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a fan for sure, but this feels like clickbait. Why not mention the Gorrilaz in the title? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Melodyne Essential is super easy to use and intuitive, and it probably can do whatever you need for pitch correction. It's the little brother to the full version and you can pick it up for $99. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We need more information from you before we can answer intelligently. Do you prefer using a Mac or a PC, for example? Are you just looking to multi-track audio, or are you going to dive into MIDI and using soft synths? 

If you just want the basics and use a Mac, then garage band is probably all you need. If you want a fully functional DAW, use Logic Pro if you're a Mac user. If you're a PC user, you'll get a bunch of different opinions, but the right answer is using the software that feels the most intuitive to you. Pro Tools is probably the most common option. Ableton and Reason also have lots of proponents and a decent entry price point. I learned on Cakewalk Sonar years ago, so that's what I still prefer to use. </TEXT>
