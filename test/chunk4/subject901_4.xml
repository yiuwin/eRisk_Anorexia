	<TEXT> In the afternoons, I watch a 20 year old with down syndrome and I took him to see Thor 2. I thought, just like the first Thor, there was a LOT of pointless talking before you get to the good parts. That being said, Christopher Eccleston plays the main villain and he is my favorite Doctor Who (9th). He did a good job being creepy. When the action kicks in, it is pretty fun to watch. The kid enjoyed it, so that's all that matters. The **poopcorn** was 5.75 for a medium and that was ridiculous. TIL movie popcorn cost more, per ounce, than sirloin steak. </TEXT>

"Questions" is one of my favorites and it's one of his first songs. Anghellic has some great tracks on it like This Ring (loved seeing Tech perform this live). Absolute Power is one of my favorite albums. Slacker is my anthem! HA! Just listen to the whole discography front to back. You wont be disappointed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of, I'm a Technician 4 Life. Have been since "Questions" and Something Else is ony my top 10 greatest albums of all time. You inspire me in my writings. Real Talk.


On October 26th, 2008, I got VIP tickets for my gf at the time and I to your Amarillo, TX show. We almost didn't make the Meet N Greet because that venue was in the middle of nowhere! We did make it with 10 minutes to spare. You, Krizz, Kutt, Prozac, Grave Plott, LA, Skatterman and Snug Brim were there....and everyone else was gone. Twas awesome. Just me and these talented rappers I looked up to. Got some pics, autographs, handshakes. http://i.imgur.com/GDj4vVR.jpg

Before I left, I asked you if I can give you my demo. I had put it together the 3 days before I left Dallas for the show. It was called "The Entree Sampler" and it featured songs that I had made the beats and lyrics for and my buddy did the producing. I said I would beat myself up if I didn't take this chance. You said (paraphrasing a small bit), "Yes. We listen to everything. You never know when the next big thing is going to pop up." It really made my day. In fact, it made my year. 

One of the songs on there was called "The XXX Mile". https://soundcloud.com/johnny-pree/xxxtra-mile

A year later, you put out K.O.D. (which was an incredible album, but then again, all of them are) and you have a track called Strange Music Box. http://youtu.be/r6FNB2Hy5j8

My producer and other people say it is quite similar and I must agree. But I'm not here begging for money or want any problems. I just have to ask...

Is there a SLIGHT chance you did hear my song back in the day, forgot about it, and while you and Seven were makin' tracks for K.O.D. the melody from my song might have popped back into your head, without knowing or realizing where it came from or that you heard it before? 

I just want to know if this was just an honest accident or a unfortunate coincidence. If anything, it would be flattering. =) No matter what, I will always be a Technician. In life and in death. 

I wish nothing but greatness for you and Strange Music.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Old Man Ozzy should be a supervillain's cat!

This is L.G. and Smuggles: http://i.imgur.com/f3zviD9.jpg

They are best friends, but my story is about L.G. My father used to live in these apartments that I stayed at where the hallway connected to the parking garage. One night, at 3am, I come home to this cat, no more than 5 or 6 months old, meowing up and down the hallway. So for the night I let him in, made him a bed and shared Smuggles' food with him. (Smuggles, from what we can guess, is the same age) The next day my dad and I put up signs all over our apartments on how we found this cat and we were looking for the owner. We decided until we found his owner, we would call him Little Guy since he was a little cat and we didn't want to get overly attached. FAST FORWARD no one called about the cat, he is 3-4 years old and weighs over 20 pounds. Little Guy got shortened to L.G. (or Large Guy). He and Smuggles share sunlight together, clean each other, and occasionally rough house all over the place. I even wrote a parody of the Pinky and the Brain theme song for them: https://soundcloud.com/johnny-pree/smuggles-and-l-g

	<TEXT> I have added this album to my wishlist: http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-New-Orleans-Jazz-Part/dp/B0082AQI1U/ref=reg_hu-rd_add_1_dp 

(I heard his version of Happy Together just yesterday on the radio and it brightened up my shitty day. It's the only album on my WL)


I don't cry easily, but I almost did the other day watching The Muppet Show. Gonzo fell in love with Madeline Kahn and overheard her telling Kermit that she doesn't have feelings for him. At the ending of the show, Gonzo sang this song about how he doesn't like being him that Madeline Kahn overheard and she apologized to him. Then Gonzo sang the second verse about how he loved being him.....and son of a bitch if my eyes weren't ready to burst into tears. Luckily Madeline Kahn was about to cry herself and asked Gonzo for a hanky, to which she gives her a magician's hanky scarf that just keeps going. It made me laugh instead of cry. I was watching this episode with my sister who came in from out of town and she had the exact same emotional roller coaster as I did within that 3 minutes of show. 

While I was typing this, I decided to find it on YouTube. HERE IT IS: http://youtu.be/UCtDHjuF8ik I am watching it again and I'm about to cry again. Holy Crap the feels. I loved this show and I will always have great MEMORIES of childhood because of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always liked The Pied Piper of Hamelin. It's a great character you can take in any direction. Switch the gender, make him the hero/villain, The Pied Piper is the way to go! 

What if you did the Frog Prince before he became a frog? Eh?!?!?

Of course Rumplestiltskin is a great villain, but what about the Boogey Man? I'm trying to think of a good old timey myth creature to throw into the mix.

I could just list a ton of characters, but I will stick with just my 3. Pied Piper, Pre-Frog Prince, and The Boogey Man </TEXT>

My reason is this: in a world of video games, iPads, and instant streaming of shows, it is important to keep a kid's imagination alive by going outside and being awesome. Even though Scribblenauts is a very imaginative game, I think a costume of the main character would be great to keep that same mind frame of creativity and take it outdoors. (Let it be known I LOVE Batman. A costume of Batman would also be nice, but the Scribblenauts one is more create things and less break things on accident around the house.) 

FYI my brother's wife is having twin boys and on is going to be named Maxwell. I love that name. MAXWELL ROCKS! </TEXT>

I thought it was going to be a bust, but he enjoyed it a lot. We used to read the books and it is something that brings us closer together. Here is a pic:

	<TEXT> British: The Ricky Gervais Show. Karl Pilkington's blabberings are hilarious. Plus it's a cartoon. (Also recommend An Idiot Abroad. Same cast. Real life travels. I think one time you see a baby matinee)

Since you watched Doctor Who: Watch Torchwood. Captain Jack Harkness. More raw (but there is lots of cursing, more blood, and more male butts, but no baby matinee) I'm watching Season 4 that Starz did and it's good.

Australian: Danger 5. Though there are only 6 episodes, you can get the DVD or watch it randomly on Hulu. Funny FUNNY show mocking late spy shows. "And like always, KILL HITLER."  (I watched this with my baby matinee friend and he couldn't stop blubbering with laughter)

American: Mel Brooks Collection. Though expensive, Amazon is having a Black Friday deal on them. More than 60% off! (insert baby matinee pun here)

Other shows: Anything from the Planet Earth Series. Life, Blue Planet, Human Planet, Baby Manitee World. They are all good and worth rewatching over and over. The BBC version with David Attenborough is the better version. [WARNING one of the series might not exist]

Just to be clear, I love baby matinee.

Her and I go way WAY back. The first time we met she was 7 years old. She was like most young girls, afraid of monsters in her wall. Frightened, but she felt safe around me. I didn't see her again for 12 years. Even thought she was older, she still had the imagination of that little girl. I was like her "imaginary friend" and we would go on adventures through time and relative dimensions in space. We would fight robots, aliens, dinosaurs, and meet very interesting people. We were the best of friends. Still are. You can find out more about us on November 23. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One day, beloved actor Nicolas Cage was at an Italian restaurant and he ordered his favorite, a meatball sub. It wasn't a dish the restaurant was known for, but he thought it was the best meatball sub there was. So great, in fact, that he could swallow the whole thing up in one gulp. Well that night, when the waiter delivered his meatball sub, Nick Cage received a phone call about an upcoming movie role, and it was important that he took the call right away. While on the phone, two mice were hiding in a plant that was sitting not too far from Nick's table. When they saw that he had left his meatball sub unattended, one mouse said to the other, "I'm going to steal one of those meatballs and we will eat like kings!" The other mouse replied, "Ok, but please be careful, Gary." So Gary the mouse ran out of the plant, across the floor, up on the table, and made it on to of the meatball sub unnoticed. Gary the mouse couldn't decided which meatball was the best to take, because they all looked so delicious. Suddenly, Nicolas Cage got off the phone. He had landed the part! He was so excited that he didn't bother to look at his sub before he picked it up and swallowed it and Gary the mouse whole. A few moments later, Gary awoke inside Nick's stomach. He looked around and saw another mouse playing solitaire on a matchbox. Gary ran over to the other mouse and said, "Did you try to steal a meatball of Nicolas Cage's sub?" The other mouse answered, "Yeah. He got a call about a movie he ended up taking. That guy will do anything." Gary then said, "Well we have to get out of here!" The other mouse stopped playing his game of solitaire, walked over to Gary, put his arm around his shoulder, and said, "Im sorry, but there's no way out of here." Gary didn't take the news well and began to throw a temper tantrum. He knock over the other mouse's cards, flipped the matchbox, and stomped his feet in a circle. The other mouse tried to calm him down and was like, "Chill man! Goin crazy isn't going to help matters!" Gary stopped, took a few deep breaths and said, "You're right. In spite of my rage, I am still just a rat in a Cage."

TASK 2) The Incredibles. Not only do they show family values, but they also show teamwork. Almost every superhero has had a partner one way or another and it is important to work fluently with them. They fight without killing, they are greater when they play off each other, and they prove it's possible to have loved ones and live a normal life while saving the world. (Other than that, Batman is the bee's knees)

TASK 3) This shirt is.......dare I say......incredible?

	<TEXT> I recently went to a costume party.

I had somehow convinced 8-9 people to all dress up as the Red Ranger. Well, a lot of bullshit happened to me and I didn't have the $55 for the Red Ranger suit...so I improvised. I got a park ranger costume and spray painted it red. I won the costume contest.

So I decided to post a pic of me and one of the Red Rangers on Reddit. The other guy had the zentai suit and lets just say it twas a bit cold outside. I ended up getting frontpage but most of the comments were about his "lil moose knuckle". THEN I did a random Google search for it and sure enough other people had blogged about it but not about my costume....but about the small package. Turns out the internet loves tiny weiners more than clever puns. 

Dickness be whack, holmes.....oops. I meant Sickness be whack, holmes!
