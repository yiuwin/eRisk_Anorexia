	<TEXT> Would your government really use drones against its own people, though? 

Considering some of the shit some police currently do against the citizenry, this wouldn't seem like a far-fetched idea.


I mean, the moment they did, the international community would leap to help America!

I would hope so. But, do we still have anybody willing to support us? Trump certainly isn't making us (the US) look very likable, at the moment.

Like we did with Syria!

Genuinely curious by this statement. You must be Russian?

Or, by *help*, you mean the countries that took in Syrian refugees? Not trying to be dense here. Just kinda confused.

	<TEXT> Thanks for the well thought response. I suppose, as I play this half hearted "devils advocate", that I might be giving their party too much credit. I may be underestimating how entrenched their indoctrination has become. I really hope that this isn't true, but all signs point otherwise. Until I see some of the system's predictive molds and regularities break cadence, I fear that you are probably right on most counts. 

Personally, I just don't get it. I never understood the want to follow the status quo (I mean I do, I guess...it's cuz it's easier than thinking for yourself). This is something a lot of people, regardless of political preference, seem to prefer. Fuck all that. I am a confirmed Catholic and I managed to break the shackles of much of the thought control that was flung at me throughout my childhood. It's not that hard, and strangely enough I never turned into a criminal (I may be somewhat of a deviant at times though..)

But I digress, I know I can't expect everyone to think like me, I suppose. I just wish that people weren't so stupid sometimes. Whatever.. I ramble. Take care! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with everything you said, except I'm having a hard time thinking that the GOP, as a whole, would be okay in making themselves look even worse in the public's eyes. And not just on the nat'l level, but the international one, as well. If they want their party to be a political mainstay (and not a mockery) throughout whatever is left of America's history, there should be some resistance from within, at least minimally; it doesn't have to sway conservative minds necessarily, just some sort of gumption to show people that they aren't the idiots that Trump is currently making them out to be.

I speak as a registered non-partisan and I would love to see the GOP grow some balls and speak out and tell their leader that now is the time to behave like a professional. The stage he is now on is not a fucking playground. The GOP needs to help get some sense into this guy (a first good step, imo, would be to eliminate poisonous counsel, like whoever this Conway is). The image of America is getting destroyed right now. That is *sad*.

	<TEXT> Ahh! Thanks for the response. 

Had to go and some a bit of goog digging to see if I could stream that doc somewhere to see the mentioned 100 footer. Although, I'm still looking for a decent link, I did come across a good article from 2003 detailing the Odyssey's mission, and both [Cortez and Jaws were mentioned.](http://www.si.com/vault/2003/03/17/339758/the-chase-is-on-for-the-hundred-foot-wave-the-billabong-odyssey-has-the-worlds-top-surfers-gunning-for-the-really-big-one)

Nazare, Portugal seems to have some pretty gnarly waves too. Gonna go back and googs some more; this kinda shit fascinates me


E: Apparently Mike Parsons was the one that rode that big one at Jaws in the Odyssey doc and it was a [64 ft wave.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsHzU0ynRZk) So not 100 ft, but still fucking huge. Before the Odyssey, however, he rode a 66 footer at Cortez, which he got the world record for. Then he broke that record in 2008 with a 77 footer again at Cortez.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Parsons_%28surfer%29

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortes_Bank

http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/surfing/sites/features/pages/billabong_odyssey.shtml


Garrett McNamara has the current *Guinness* record of 78 ft surfed at Nazare, Portugal (I italicized Guiness, cuz it looks like there could be dispute over the tallest wave ever ridden, but Guinness seems to be the most "official" documentation). Garrett also has claims to have ridden a 100 footer also in Navare.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_McNamara


Benjamin Sanchis has also ridden a wave that many believe to be at least 100 ft.

http://www.theinertia.com/surf/did-benjamin-sanchis-finally-break-the-100-foot-wave-barrier-2/#modal-close



I'm sure there are others claiming the "big one", but I'm getting hungry. I didn't realize how much homework looking this up would be haha. Feel free to expand.

	<TEXT> The standard grip amongst us kitchen dreggs with a chefs knife is probably the grip shown in the right-most picture; i.e. the "pinch grip". It provides the most stability/control and prevents the blade from twisting while you are cutting.
For example, the potential of the handle becoming a bit slippery when cutting is a pretty common occurrence in the kitchen. And the potential for the blade rolling or twisting in your hand is much higher with the first two grips vs. the pinch grip which pretty much eliminates this possibility regardless if the handle gets slick or not. The choke up and the pinch of the blade prevents any kind of roll out and/or possibility of bleeding all over someones dinner.

I do find the middle photo, with the index finger splayed over the spine of the knife, to be somewhat useful/comfortable when butchering/cleaning proteins, though. 

I guess it's really whatever floats your fancy and is most comfortable to you when you use a knife. But, for me, one of the first things I notice about a cook is how they hold a knife. It says a lot.

	<TEXT> Yeah, it's crazy what age has done to me and what I'm not ashamed to say I listen to these days. Not gone as far as Taylor Swift, Kanye, but what I'm *open* to these days is way different than when it was all Bad Brains, Strung Out, Mudvayne, Slipknot, etc, etc. 


Tool will always be my mainstay, though

	<TEXT> Idk, I'm kind of opposite you guys (also, probably a few years older~36). I hated them when they first broke out...like 15 years ago? But, it hasn't been until maybe 4 or 5 years ago that I've come.  to appreciate them as a band. But don't you ever dare call me a recovering punk/metalhead:P

	<TEXT> Although, I really would probably  disagree with just about anything she had to say from a political (maybe any) standpoint, I really can't fault solely her for thinking this way. People are molded by their upbringings: family, friends, localized society. It's pretty easy to get lost in that sort of dissonance when you never have anybody within your "circle" to encourage you to look outside the box. And you know what? Why the fuck would I want someone that counter thinks things a part of my circle, anyways? 


Maybe, perhaps, for growth/maturity/wisdom? And, I know that that is the answer. But, I aint gonna lie, it's hard to break that mold. I know. I struggle with this *all* the time.


E: cadence and clarification </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I just finished watching the rest of it and it was really good. But, it is quite a bit different than Soderbergh's version. Neither in a bad or good way. Just different.


Having not read the book, I feel like Tarkovsky's version may be more closely aligned to the book and Soderbergh may have taken a little more directorial privilege in his adaptation. There seemed to be more story in T's. Like on an *existential* level. I mean that was there too, in S' version, but the idea of intimate love, in his, seemed to predicate the former.

Camerawork, composition were beautiful in T's. And the screenplay and script were also on point.


Like I said, I think they are both good; just *different*. I'll definitely have to watch T's a few more times to try and understand it better for sure. All in all, I think you would really like it. Fyi: It is pushing on 3hrs, though. Which I don't mind, but it is the reason I had to take a sleep break, in-between </TEXT>
