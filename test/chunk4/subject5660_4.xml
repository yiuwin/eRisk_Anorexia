	<TEXT> I have to say there is this "gimmicky" way that bioware is using females. Like that crime lord or whatever, it just feels so "forced", the fact that she is a female. Dragon age is full of it, when you see some woman who is a "seargant" or something like that, it just feels so awkward.

Dark Souls however has so many characters that are females, but it never feels forced when they are a warrior or some badass, it always feels that the creator created them organically from ground up. While in bioware, they feel so ugh... Like I will write this  character and just drop a random female model voice actor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a very weak point here, but I think why TF1 and 2 can't break out is because of the main game mode. Everything is fine about attrition, except that it ENDS or ends too soon. 

Even with TF2 I can't keep myself for playing too long, like other games, but in most other games there is a better relation of time-fun.

I just think they need to let you play more Attrition, the game mode needs to last longer, too many times I just get warmed up and into the game, when you are forced to end. 

Also fuck that campaign and the resources wasted on it. I wish narrow minded people would stop screeching at the developers for a single player campaign where its just not needed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "if you're white, in America

That's the problem, Americans are so inside their own asshole that they forget there is a world out there that works differently. They truly believe that white people are privileged everywhere even in countries with 100% white people. I think its also dangerous to believe that by being white even in America you have some institutional privileged status, its almost like saying "Hey you white homeless people, go fuck yourselves".

I think its setting a really cancerous and toxic worldview, and it can create problems.

	<TEXT> I really don't give a shit if physical print dies, I am not sentimental to paper. May I just add, that I cannot stand the people that say they "need the feeling of paper between hands etc", mankind existed before paper and it can exist after, your eyes can absorb information perfectly well of a digital print too. Stop making book reading look like some deep ancestral, sensual experience like its sex. Just get some books on your phone and start reading them, its what you read what matters not what you hold while reading it.

Now , what does worry me, is if we start over relying on digital, as in it will be very dangerous if something happens to our electronics, and I don't mean world disaster, even just on local level.  After all, I if a power outage happens, I can light on a candle and read/write, but not with my device, because it has a very short battery life. 

So it feels more comfortable if we have both ways of preserving knowledge, rather then one.  </TEXT>

I have been playing this game on and off for months, for entire months on my 8.1 Win Pro. So I do not understand why is that the solution suddenly, because the game worked fine all this time.

The DirectX 9 bothers me, because it makes the game feel clunky and unresponsive to me, when I alt-tab it feels so really uncomfortable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was really a rookie with MMA when I watched that fight. The round-point system made me confused and it still does a bit.

I mean, I was completely baffled how can Bispin win this match when he did nothing, fuck the significant strikes. Fact is, if this was fight with no financial incentive, nobody would have want to be in Bispin's body.

Then also, I though and still think, fighters like Bispin need to be praised for recovering from such brutal shots, not everybody can do it.  </TEXT>

Well, there was also that football player, the way he talked about Trump I liked, it didn't come as he recited classical complaints, but he just spoke out of his heart in a very reasonable way.

	<TEXT> What ideologies, he talked about his personal life or rather some cool anecdotes and about numbers and economics. Maybe I should have phrased it differently as he didn't bore me with his political ideologues.  To me he seems like a man who just does what works for him, like he gives a shit about some grand ideas or policies. 

Anyway, that's why the podcast felt completely different than for example Crowder or McGuiness who can't shut up about the left/right etc...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the most refreshing podcast, Pena didn't spew any ideological bullshit.

EDIT:

I seriously don't get this sub, any guest that doesn't spend every second talking bad things about Trump is "literally Hitler". Why do people even watch Joe Rogan? Seems like a wrong place to be if you have special snowflake feelings and just want leftist crusaders or scientists that are heavily leaning left.

	<TEXT> As somebody living in the region, I can safely say that I have never seen or heard a Serbian/Croatian/Bosniak politician that seems like a legitimacy good human being that wants just wants to improve the life standard and try to let everybody get along. Like I have never seen a single one I would vote for, and all the political leaders are horrible, like all of them make me sick.

My rough guess as for why that is, is that all the good ones got "cleansed" or died during ww2, and all you got left was the corrupt elite, their offspring and people who learned their trade. Also, the West(US,EU) since the 90s is playing the ex-Yu countries like a flute, though Russia is getting its influence back.  I have just seen and heard too much to be an naive idiot to think they didn't want to the tear apart Yugo.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I got my lenses from my doc, I was told to not shower, wash my face or swim with the lenses. Logic being that my eyes cannot clean themselves with lenses inside. 

But my question is now, at which point is one to careful? There are many ways minute amounts of fluids, most likely water can enter your eye (or at least I think they do).

I mean do I really have to take my lenses out and clean them eyes with the lens solutions, every time:

I wash dishes, sit in a summer cafe with sprinklers, workout (sweat goes down into my eyes), when I drink something, when its raining etc...
