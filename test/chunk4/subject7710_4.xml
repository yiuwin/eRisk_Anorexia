	<TITLE> Toronto real estate market </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-12 10:38:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, my family has been shoveling money into the Durham region (East-end of the Greater Toronto Area(GTA)), and a few other parts of the GTA. We're talking upwards of 60% of our assets. 

The market shows no signs of slowing down! A home we purchased in 2008 for $350,000 just sold for a little over a million! That isn't even an outlier, [a home worth around 240k in 2008 is worth 655k today](http://creastats.crea.ca/osha/images/osha_chart05_xhi-res.png)!

That being said, there are a few caveats to this growth. The Canadian dollar has depreciated considerably over this time. This is great for our family as we are buying with U.S. dollars and paying the mortgages with USD, but if it continues, it could reduce our returns. 

Also, that average price doesn't take into account the increased number of new, large homes. It's simply a market average, not the price of an equivalent home in both time periods.

Regardless, this growth is incredible. My question is, what are your expectations? How long do you see this growth lasting? How would you proceed in this situation? What are the implications of the upcoming land transfer do you expect?

	<TEXT> The best thing about real estate is that you can earn rent while your investment appreciates. When my dad was in university, we owned a home but lived in the basement and rented out the upstairs. Our tenants paid our mortgage and utilities! 

We are pretty happy today and it's all thanks to putting our money in that [real estate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJeVCdEVpHc). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted to be a rapper/actor growing up.

In reality, I'm going to be interning in the investment banking arm of a large bank over the summer. Most likely, I will have a career in finance (portfolio management, banker, etc.). 

I hope it'll be like *Wolf of Wall Street*. </TEXT>

Birds are super light fluffballs. They're designed to fly.

	<TEXT> I fucking hate April Fools' Day, it's the day I lost my mother to a 5-year battle with Lou Gehrig's disease. Saddest day of my life. 

I didn't believe the *nurse* on the phone. "It must be a prank, I thought. I have some asshole friends, they're just pranking me...My mom can't be gone." Of course, that itself is an April Fools' joke.

	<TEXT> Oh my sweet summer child, what do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die, all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little lord, when the white walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story you like?  </TEXT>

1. Rule 4: Don't repost

Don't post stuff you found from elsewhere on the web, it's probably been here already.

This subreddit is for original content only, meaning memes YOU made.

Do not resubmit your post because it did poorly.

Reposting is a bannable offense.

If you see a repost please report it as such, and send a quick note to the mods if you can.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1 2. Rule 3: Follow the correct format

Two line joke over a re-usable character.

We understand that some established memes do not follow this format, such as

What Year Is It?

I Should Buy a Boat Cat

Etc

However, these memes are already well established and thus have been grandfathered in.

Not all image macros are memes

Meme -

/mm/

noun

an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, esp. imitation.

source
Basically if the image is only relevant to one's own submission and can't be re-used (or has limited re-usability) then it's just an image macro and by definition not a meme.

This is an example of a generic image macro.
and

This is an example of a meme.
Memes are allowed on the subreddit here, while generic image macros are better suited for /r/funny.
