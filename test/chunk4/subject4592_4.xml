	<TITLE> [EVERYTHING] Shuffle the personalities of several of the characters, what happens? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-27 16:29:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Suppose you were to rewrite all the personalities of the personalities of the characters. They retain the social positions, birth orders and so on of the character, but they simply act in the way another character would act.  
For simplicity sake, lets refer to a character by the personality not the position.  
For example: Let shuffle Arya, Sansa and Daenerys's personalities.  
Now Daenerys is eldest daughter of the Starks, Sansa is the younger, Arya is a Targaryen and in exile across the narrow sea.  
What happens?  

In this example: Arya was always tomboyish, so I think she would take to learning archery first from the Dothraki, this might earn Drogo's favor in a different way then Daenerys's seeing her as a warrior and instructing her in he way of the arakhs, for her first kill she face stabs Vaserys, she rides the Dothraki sea as a warrior queen until Drogo dies... possibly in roughly the same manner as he did in the prime reality, but more interestingly, in a duel with Arya over a perceived slight to his authority. A pyre later and she's got dragons, some walking later and she learns the way of the westerosi knight from Selmy, a demonstration of the use of air power later, she's learning the fighting style of the Unsullied and so on. So in this reality Arya is more of the  face bash type of ultimate warrior, rather than the sneaky stabby kind of ultimate warrior.  
  
Daenerys is betrothed to Jeoffrey. She is rapidly disabused of any notion of Jeoffrey being noble, but does something about it. It's a tug of war between Her and Cersei for Jeoff, but the Queen has entrenched position and more starting political capital, Robert dies, Ned is killed in a target strike from the Queen. Dany is still building favor with the Jeoff, Cersei enters into a tacit alliance with Margaery. It still isn't enough, Dany has been building favor with both the King and has been starting with the other lords. Robb is dead, it's against Jeoff's will but Maragery is now to be Queen. Tyrion is forced to marry her. Tyrion sees potential and his own declining position in the family, they forge a platonic alliance. With the two of them doing a good cop/bad cop on Jeoff he is almost completely turned. Cersei is beginning to see the Jeoff is now completely lost. She poisons him and pins the blame on Tyrion and Danerys. Jamie and Little Finger spring the two of them, they escape north to rally the Stark armies.  
So in this reality, Daenrys is fighting against specific opponents using manipulations rather than fighting against socio/economic forces. It's arguable which one is harder, on the one hand she has people specifically targeting her and actively countering her moves, on the case she is attempting to undo civilization underpinnings in a system too big to care about her.
  
Sansa continues to be useless and mopes about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, loving the game.  
I also love playing healers.  
Got a level 70 sorcerer and am working on a smuggler.   
I have a couple of questions regarding healing in this game.  

1) I have found the user interface slightly lacking for healing (kinda hard to tell at a glance which team mates are about to die ), are UI mods available/legal? If so, which ones would you recommend?  
2) Am I expected to be able to keep a team of 3 DPSers alive? or is it reasonable to expect a tank?   
3) When a tank is present, are they expected to maintain agro at all times, or is large amounts of damage to he DPSers and myself to be expected?  
4) Am I expected to deal damage at all?

Factories will shut down, shops will close, stock markets will not trade, and government will grind to a halt.The wealthy will flee overseas with their families, citizens desperately trade their currency for food, doors all across the country will be plastered with red notices and the empty streets will reek of lingering gunpowder. The people, with nothing to do will turn to day-long drinking and gambling. Children will roam the streets begging for money. So sad."

	<TEXT> Hi, so I just started playing, barely level 5.  
I've been planning on playing a Sorcerer.  
I like healing, I'm definitely one of the better healers in PVP/PVE in The Secret World and from what I gather the Sorcerer is one of the better healers in the game, is this still true?   
I've also read that they have some of the worst DPS in the game, is this also true?  
If it is, will I have difficulty with the solo content due to my lack of damage.  
How easy is it to switch between roles in this game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So gaming is a pretty big part of my life, I was hoping I could introduce my father to gaming.  
Unfortunately he's very closed minded.  
He seem to have decided he hates games even though he has never tried them.  
I've tried showing him the Telltale Walking Dead game, he walked out after 5 minutes.  
I really want to introduce him to the wide world that is modern gaming, but I can't get him through the first door, anyone have any advice? </TEXT>

I have spent more time outside of the country I was born in than I have inside it.  
The thing about America is, that after a while it seeps in.  
I've developed an American Accent, I thought I had developed an American world view.  
Maybe in a way I thought I was something of an American, despite lacking any of the legal trappings.   
This election just proved me wrong, I do not share the world view of America. There is no place for me in America.  
And that got me thinking, where is my home? Where do I belong.  
I've been back, I don't speak the same way.   
English is my only real language, the way languages work in Singapore is that pure and "proper" english is reserved for formal interactions and business transactions. Casual conversation is in a creole language that I can understand but not replicate. As a result I constantly came off as stuck up and arrogant.  
When I went back for a visit and had some errands to run, people automatically assumed I was a foreigner.  
Do you have any idea how fucking emotionally damaging it is to know that no matter where on earth you are, you are a foreigner.  
I am homesick, and I don't have a home.  
I don't know what to do anymore.    
I am not an American, I never have been, now I don't know what I am. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From my understanding when it was created in 1871, Germany instantly became one of the most largest, most populous and most powerful countries in Europe.  
So why did the other major powers let this happen? Wouldn't a bunch of weak minor powers be better for their goals?   
How were Germany's founders able to pull that off?   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Getting really frustrated with the Note 7 exchange in Australia. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-05 09:41:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am seriously getting frustrated with the Note 7 exchange program here.    
  
I bought a Note 7 from a store in Singapore, was force to leave it behind and had a family member ship the replacement Note 7 to me. And now the saga really begins.  
  
So the 2nd Note 7 recall begins, I go to a Samsung store in Australia, they tell me I have to go through support.  
I call support on October 13 and they say 14-21 buisiness days for processing and I get a replacement Edge 7.    
OK, that's fair organizing this stuff takes time, etc.  
Now, I get a call on Nov 3rd, "Oh your processing is complete, now wait up to 21 business days  for us to send a courier to your door, no we aren't going to make sure he calls you to arrange some pickup time, it's down to pure luck if you're around at that time, he might leave you a note if he can't find you. " Well duh, we haven't coordinated jack! Are they just expecting me to be at my apartment for the entirety of the next 21 days?  
  
Oh and they'll be sending me the gift voucher by SNAIL MAIL, and they are only posting it after I make the exchange.  
So that's another week or so of hoping I don't drop my phone face first, or just wasting that money buying the case out of pocket.  
Oh and they were also apparently out of my first choice of color too, they only told me that in Novemeber.  
   
My only question is: WHY?  
Why can't I just go to a service center somewhere, hand in my phone and get the new one. I'd take an Uber to some random warehouse in the outback if it would be faster.  
Why can't they just email me the voucher, or hand it with the courier who is apparently authorized to handle a $1000 device.   
  
I was still a Samsung fan after the first recall, now this second recall is has killed any brand loyalty to Samsung. If one more thing messes up with this process I'm not even going to consider them for my next phone.

In order to make a 180 you see the bike turn around before going straight.  
Just wondering if really makes you turn slower. </TEXT>
