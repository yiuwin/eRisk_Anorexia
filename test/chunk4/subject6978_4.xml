	<TEXT> I had this exact pain around a week ago when I changed my routine. I took some ibuprofen  to avoid inflammation based on a doctor's recommendation, and used some arnica cream, which is made out of herbs and helps with muscle and joint pain. I still kept on working out every other day and it passed after 5 or 6 days </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started making tuna balls
I brown some onions, add in red bell pepper and shredded carrot. Mix in the tuna and some egg to make it moist. Season to liking with salt pepper and parsley, stuck in the oven for half an hour.
Easy, fast, filling, cheap, healthy! Love it. They turn out pretty moist too! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course. Whatever you can think of, accutane can dry it. I had a bloody nose once or twice but nothing major. The problem solved when I started applying whatever I used on my kips, in my nose. Aquaphor, bepanthene, whatever it was... Now no issues  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something you should be aware of is that research shows that to achieve long term results, and not get acne back, you should reach 100-120 mg of accutane per kilogram. You can divide that in a few months or more. For me personally it is exactly 40mg for 6 months. This is considered an average dosage, not too high or too low.
Everybody reacts very differently to accutane. For me, dry lips and arms. Hair and face stopped being a greasy mess and became normal to somewhat dry. Sometimes dry eyes, and once in a while dry nose with a bit of bleeding.
I had mild acne, which is why I only started taking accutane in my twenties, after nothing worked for about yen years. I'm now entering my sixth month, and the results have been amazing. I had a very fast improvement and haven't had a zit since a month and a half in!
Good luck, feel free to PM me </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you taking accutane? If you are, you must stop all kinds of topicals, and anything you use for treating acne! Your routine should be as if you were taking care of a baby- mild soap like cetaphil, moisturizer, and sunscreen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest the only think that helped my acne was accutane. I know many people don't want to take it.. I say be as gentle as you can to your skin. Use mild things, try the beginner's routine from here </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few weeks ago I started making green smoothies! Decided to buy a cheap blender and try it out, couldn't be happier! 
My favorite so far: 2 cups of spinach, 1 big carrot, half a red apple, half a banana, low fat yogurt. So creamy with the yogurt, tastes very good. I sweeten with some stevia, you could also de agave or honey if you need more sweetness. I usually drink this smoothie every day now. I just froze some bananas and apples already cut into portions- this makes a very cold and refreshing smoothie and assures you won't be out of ripe bananas! Give it a go </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't pop or pick at anything! When on accutane, they heal faster anyway. Your skin is very sensitive now, so doing anything to your pimples would be a very bad idea. Before accutane you probably would have applied some sort of topical- so imagine that right now you are putting on the best topical that you can... Except for you're taking it orally. 
I never picked it my skin, and wore sunscreen, now during my fifth month accutane everything faded away, you can't even tell I once had acne! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was at the gym, doing some arm exercises, looking in the mirror. I looked at my skin, admired how great it looked and wondered, "which foundation am I wearing today?" Well, in fact, I was not wearing foundation, just rolled out of bed in the morning and went straight to the gym. Yay accutane!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've made it a point during my entire course to take accutane along with something fatty. The one time I didn't, just ate a salad before, I got a stomach ache.. A very unpleasant one. Also as mentioned before, you need fats for the accutane to absorb properly. Of course there's no need to go crazy, just make sure there's something there, chicken, avocado, oil, milk or whatever  </TEXT>
