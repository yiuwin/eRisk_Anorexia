	<TEXT> 4 phone lines are ringing but no one is able to pick it up.

 3 patients are waiting to check out, but the current patient checking out wants to schedule appointments and chit chat for 15 minutes.

The lobby is so full that patients have to stand around or outside.

The doctors' schedules are over booked, but patients without appointments keep walking in.

The printer's jammed again, but someone wants a printed receipt.

There's paperwork and files everywhere on the counter.

The float is running around trying to keep patients in order and the doctor's from getting behind.

And it's only 10 in the morning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love haircuts. I love how they feel and I love making drastic changes to my appearance. 

Bangs? Bring it on. 

Layers? Love it! 

Pixie cut? Perfect. 

I've been itching to start dying my hair different colors, but my work has already said that it isn't allowed. *Sigh*. Guess I'll just have to keep getting it cut! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure! I think pastel colors are refreshing and crisp. I've never been a fan of neon and bright colors. They throw me off and I don't like looking at them. But pastel colors like lilac and mint green seem so inviting to me. Mostly they remind me of the sky and how I feel when I watch sunrises and sunsets, utterly relaxed. </TEXT>

I don't know if it stems from my terrible self esteem. 

I don't know if it's because I might not be attracted to guys.


All I know is that every time I kiss or let someone touch me, I am deeply ashamed and sickened with myself. I can *feel* it in the pit of my stomach and the back of my throat. The next day I'll sit in my bathtub and try to scrub away the repulsion, but it's still there. I don't know how to be okay with it. </TEXT>
