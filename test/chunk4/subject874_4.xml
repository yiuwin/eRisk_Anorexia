Bonus LPT: For places that accrue points or whatever, you can even try redeeming the rewards it has gained. Is this ethical? I don't know, but the free sandwich was super tasty! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I assume:
1. Less corners, less places for dirt/mold to collect.
2. Less floor-level barriers means mopping can be done faster
3. For a large bathroom, it could save a few minutes, and if you have 10 to clean it makes a difference.
4. If you need to collect any debris, all debris can be swept/mopped into one spot and then picked up instead of picking it up out of each stall </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another one that got me about 10 years ago in Budapest is called "Consumption Girls". Some attractive local girls in nice "normal" clothing approach you and make small talk. They invite you to "have a beer" in a pub just around the corner. They take you to a restaurant which is not easily exited (long hallway, elevator, etc.). They order appetizers and drinks, assuring you it's "what they drink" in Budapest. They are charming, invite you to dance, and you might even have a nice time (I did). Until the bill comes, at which point you are frantically trying to figure out the USD equivalent for whatever ungodly number of "forint" is on the bill. For me it was about $400. I asked if we could split it between us, but they said in Budapest the man pays. I asked the waiter how this could possibly be, and he brought me a menu (for the first time) and it actually had those prices. He also pointed toward the ATM, which was on the way out, but the exit was blocked by a large man whose job it was to require only paying customers would be allowed to leave. He could have broken my arm in a jiffy, and it was clear to me what my options were. I kept my arm and paid the $400 and got out of there. I later spoke with some Canadians and found out they were scammed in a similar way, but tried to make a run for it. One of them did end up in the hospital, so I think I made the wise choice. </TEXT>
