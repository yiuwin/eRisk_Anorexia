	<TEXT> Some examples would be cosmic rays, neutron radiation, alpha radiation, beta radiation, muon radiation, and antimatter radiation.

Some related questions: How is non-electromagnetic radiation detected, and would it ever be evolutionarily beneficial? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That study still seems to show a weak trend of wealthier countries in warm-climate regions, but you're right, it's not huge. 

It's interesting that back then the GDP per capita varied so little geographically. Scythia was just as wealthy as Roman Britain? Weird. I wonder if the large modern-day wealth gap between different countries is an aberration, historically. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking the Industrial Revolution caused the flip. In ancient times, the most productive farming happened in warm climates, so that's where the biggest and wealthiest cities were. Once industrialization happened, it was probably more important to be near coal mines and important trade routes than in a warm region. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting. I would have thought colder climates would be less productive, all other variables controlled. It's easier to work and travel outside in the heat than buried under 5 feet of snow. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why are regions with warmer climates typically poorer? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've noticed that whether looking within a country or between countries, the warmest regions are usually the poorest. Some examples:

A) The Deep South in the US

B) The Deep North in Australia

C) The Mediterranean countries in the EU

D) Equatorial Africa is poorer than North Africa and South Africa

E) Central America vs. Mexico

F) Brazil is poorer than "Southern cone" countries such as Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay

This pattern isn't true everywhere (for example, North vs. South Korea), but it seems to be true for most of the world. Is there an economic reason for this, maybe related to natural resources and/or agriculture, or is it just a coincidence?

	<TEXT> They say "nature abhors a vacuum", so the likely hypothesis is that the sound waves are sucked in and then repelled from the vacuum at supersonic speeds and finally reach your ear. </TEXT>
