	<TEXT> Classical liberalism is a political ideology that values the freedom of individuals  including the freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and markets  as well as limited government. It developed in 18th-century Europe and drew on the economic writings of Adam Smith and the growing notion of social progress.

We are all "liberals".... The Democratic Party is full of communists now a days. </TEXT>

This was the pinnacle of the Obama race-baiting. There's not 1 reason he could consider Trayvon his son, besides the fact that they're both black.

	<TEXT> Well if you hate living in America then you are in for a rude awakening if you ever move somewhere else. In some European countries your username would be considered hate speech against the government and the police would come knocking at your door. America is the only country left with true freedom of speech which allows you to make your claims. Maybe instead of trying to find the worst this country offers, try to be appreciative for the things it provides. You might not be as miserable. I can tell that you've been brainwashed a little bit. You want to spread your negative propaganda so much that you even made your name "inferiorAmerica" so that whenever you post people know your motives. Maybe you should read the constitution and compare it to other countries founding documents and compare and contrast them. Sure you may hate some of the things we do, but no other country enjoys the simple freedoms that we take for granted.  </TEXT>

The girl who is scheduled to sing the national anthem at the inauguration is getting death threats just for singing the national anthem. If you want a country that accepts people for their differences maybe look at your own party first before calling people out. Anybody that publicly supports Trump is shunned and called a racist.  People have different opinions on the president. Why can't the left accept that? If you aren't a liberal then in the lefts eyes you are a dumb hick conservative who isn't educated.  </TEXT>
