	<TEXT> Patience is the key. Learn every moveset. Learn dodging. Use the pillars. Always keep them both in your sight. Persistence will get you through. And you'll be a better player. Keep trying.. But not aimlessly. Try just dodging for sometime. Staying alive is more important that getting a hit in. Once you figure that out, you'll start doing better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well one factor can be the minimum to no hand holding. Like, all they teach you in the start of the game is some basic mechanics. Once you get to firelink all you're told is that you have to ring two bells, and something happens. Brilliant right? You're not even told how to get there except that one is up and the other is down below.

Second maybe the rewarding experience. Beating a boss you are stuck on for hours keeps you wanting more.

Third. The brilliant world design. At least the first half. Discovering that shortcut from undead parish to firelink through the elevator blew me away the first time. Also reaching Anor Londo the first time.

Fourth. The NPCs. I don't need to elaborate here, do I?

Fifth. The sheer number of ways you can do things. Different builds, the different order you can do areas, how you can skip bosses. 

All in all you always get back to the game. It's some sort of magic the game has that in my opinion others lack. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dodging will really help you more than blocking tbh. Fast roll with the lightest armor and basically just keep back peddling till Ornstein comes for you. Roll dodge and you can easily get two hits in, which will stagger him(depends on your weapon). I recently soloed them on my NG+ run . You can [watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOhwbX04HGw) how I did it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really prefer dodging because it consumes less stamina. All his attacks can be dodged well and it leaves him with an open window to attack. Another reason is I use the zweihander a lot. So when you light attack after a roll you get a thrusting attack which is +100 free damage. Love the fight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NG+, Ornstien   Smough, solo, melee only.

What an amazing fight. I'm so ecstatic right now.

I had posted around two days back for tips to solo them and I must say all your tips have been very helpful. Did it by two handing my Black Knight Halberd, Grass Crest on the back, Havel's Ring, Leo ring   mask of the mother for the extra HP. Basically I went in a little aggressive with Ornstein   took it really slow   careful with Super Smough.  

[Here's how I did it!](https://youtu.be/GOhwbX04HGw)Had a little shaky start though and almost died before the second phase.

I really loved the fight and can't wait to solo them again. Such a feeling. I LOVE THIS GAME!
