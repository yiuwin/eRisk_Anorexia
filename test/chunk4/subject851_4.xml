	<TEXT> The dynamic pressure is the kinetic energy one small fluid parcel has; in other words, the kinetic energy of a fluid per unit volume. 

Likewise, the work done by a fluid is the (static) pressure it exerts, integrated with respect to the volume an object spans (the area of the object, tines the distance it moves). 

This derivation comes from the definition of work as force times distance, and the definition of pressure as force over area. Since you end up with area of the object, multiplied by pressure and by the distance moved if you replace for force in the work definition, you get the pressure times volume equation. 

In this sense, the total pressure represents not the total energy of fluid, but its energy density, the energy per unit volume. Of course this ignores gravity because then the fluid has potential energy as well. 

The static and dynamic pressure, in the absence of gravity, don't equate each other. However, their changes must equal each other, provided no external work is done on the fluid by the conservation of energy. You can see it by looking at the sum of the kinetic energy, and the work done by the fluid: since no external work is done, their sum must be constant.

Anyway, I was just talking about how I could justify eating meat to myself. I mean, everybody will have their own take on the matter, and you can't argue that there is something inherently wrong or not about it. And it's weird that I say that eating meat is fine, because in the end I don't. I just can't bear the taste of anything other than chicken, and SOME fish. Not even other seafood. And even then, the chicken has to be made just right, and I need to want to eat it, and that is so exceedingly rare that I never eat chicken. And I demand even more from fish, so that's even worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to make use of a = v^2/r.
a is the total acceleration, which is given by applying the Pythagoras theorem to its components, which are given in the question already. You can see that it is constant by using the theorem on the components, so you can solve for it to obtain a value of 85.

Next you need to find v. Since this is circular motion, the magnitude of v is constant, and since speed = distance/time, the speed is the length of the arc divided by the time taken to travel that length. The problem is that you have the time, but not the length of the arc. 

You need to make use of the change in the acceleration's components. You can see that at one point the acceleration is (7,6) and at another it is (6,-7). It has the same values, but they are swapped around and one is negated. Physically speaking you can imagine the circle, and then you can see that this will happen only when the particle travels a quarter circle.

 You can also see it geometrically: when two lines are perpendicular, the x and y coordinates are swapped and one of the two is negated. That's why if the gradient of one line is m, the gradient of the perpendicular is -1/m. (Imagine a Cartesian plane if it helps.)

You still don't know the arc length it travelled, but you know the angle that it did (/2 or 90) and you know the relationship between arc length and angle: s = r. So use r for s, plug it in in the expression for v, use v^2/r = a, then solve for r.

	<TEXT> It is arbitrary. Not in the sense of units as the question asks, but in the sense of simplicity. 
Without delving into 4-vectors, the energy for a particle in relativity is

`[; \sqrt{p^2c^2 + m^2c^4}  - mc^2 + E_0 ;]`

where p is the momentum and E_0 is the energy of an object at rest. 

You can't really extract the energy of an object at rest, so the value of E_0 does not affect anything at all. Therefore an object at rest can have any arbitrary amount of energy; after all only the changes in energy count, not the actual value, and if you calculate the change in energy, the constant value means nothing. 

In Newtonian mechanics, the energy is defined as

`[; \frac {p^2}{2m} + E_0 ;]`

at least, without potential energy. In this case the value of E_0 is simply chosen to be zero, because it is the most convenient value. 

In relativity, the value of E_0 is chosen to be mc^2 to cancel out the -mc^2 term in the energy. So the choice of E = mc^2 is arbitrary, but not to make the units come out right. 

The expressions for energy that I gave above are a result of two basic principles that we assume: the law of conservation of energy and the principle of relativity and its corresponding velocity transformation law, and the definition of the kinetic energy as:

`[; T = \int {udp} ;]`

where T is the kinetic energy and u the velocity. The right hand side is just the work done; u is dx/dt, where x is the position, so dpdx/dt can be rewritten as Fdx, because dp/dt = F by Newton's second law. And since kinetic energy is generally defined as the change in energy due to the net work done (the work-energy theorem defines the kinetic energy), you can see that the above must hold true. 

There's a paper that goes on this exact premise, and it can be found here if you are interested:

	<TEXT> There's no real way of knowing. According to the wikia, he swapped bodies with some rich kid from his school when he was a kid too. But then again, it seems like he was born with that body of his that he had on Namek. So really, no way of knowing. 

Now if I had to take a guess, I would say it was his original body. He became the commander of the Ginyu force, because of his strength and dance skills. This means that he was the strongest non-family member Freeza had ever seen and highly likely to be the best dancer, unless King Cold did ballet. The Ginyu Force probably originated with him, meaning that Freeza got the idea after seeing him. This implies that he already was the strongest by the time he met Freeza at least. Which makes it seem like he did not switch bodies after having met Freeza. And there is not much reason for him to travel across planets before having met Freeza, and it is unlikely that he would have met someone strong enough to swap bodies with on his own planet. 

Furthermore, if he did that it would just be awkward. I mean, you swap bodies with some guy on your planet, and then you see him everyday. Unless he killed the guy with whom he swapped bodies, but when you do not have the insignia of the Freeza army, you probably can't kill someone and escape scot-free. 
Of course, if strength was not his goal when swapping bodies, as with the rich kid, then it is hard to tell. 

Thus, it is unlikely that he swapped bodies at all till meeting Goku, at least not if his goal was only strength.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First focus on the denominator. The denominator is z + 1, or 
rather

1 + cos  + i sin 

which is a complex number, with real part (1 + cos ) and imaginary part (sin ). You cannot, according to mathematical etiquette have a complex number in a denominator. You have to reformulate the denominator as a real number by multiplying by its conjugate.

Of course, in a fraction as above, so below, and vice-versa. You have to multiply the numerator by the conjugate of the denominator as well. Then you expand, take the real part of the above and use trig identities to solve it. 

By the way, the only time you need to concern yourself with the denominator is when finding its conjugate. Once you do that, you can completely ignore it, because the denominator can take whatever value it wants, but it will never make the expression zero. Only if the numerator is zero will the whole thing be zero.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The equation only works when something moves in a circle and with a constant radius, and there is zero tangential force. 

You can derive the equation by computing the second derivatives of the following two:

x = r cos 
y = r sin 

where  is the angle to the horizontal and r is the radius. If you compute their derivatives, you get the x-acceleration and the y-acceleration. To derive the above equation, you have to assume that r is constant and that angular speed is as well. Squaring them then adding gives the total acceleration squared, which is only mv^2 / R if the object moves in a circle and at constant tangential speed. 
You can roughly divide motion into two parts: the tangential motion and the normal motion. The tangential one is the velocity of an object that is perpendicular to the radius of the curve it traces. The normal one is the one parallel to the radius. 

Forces can also be resolved in this way: in the normal direction, which is parallel to the radius and in the tangent direction, or normal to the radius. 

When an object moves in a perfect circle so that the radius is always constant, the tangential velocity is always constant. In fact, the object moves in such a way that the force on it is always parallel to the radius. Its tangential velocity is such that the object always "dodges" the tangential component of the force. Therefore, the tangential velocity for a perfect circle is constant, and there is no tangential force. 

In general, objects moving in a curve do not need to trace a circle. Some, such as planets will trace a conic section (ellipse, circle, parabola or hyperbola), but you can create all sorts of curves by using different forces. 

On the other hand, the tangential and the parallel force are the two components of the total force, so you can work them out if you know the total force. Newton's gravitational law usually helps. </TEXT>

Britain was in a similar position, but at least it tried to resolve some conflicts. It wasn't as affected by the war and did not need that many resources to recover. However, it still was reluctant to go to war, especially with Italy or Japan and without the support of France. 

Europe was in shambles at the time. America was that parent whose always on a business trip. Britain was the big brother responsible for everybody. France was the big sister who was always mad because she had to look after the kids and who would just lock herself up. Italy and Japan were the two big bad bullies and Greece and China were their victims. Russia was that weird kid everybody ignored. Finland and the others were the small, well-behaved kids who listened to their brother. Switzerland was the kid who would sit in a corner and read, not paying attention to what was going on.

	<TEXT> The US did isolate themselves, but what I meant is that Europe badly needed their help. US was the most powerful country, and was the least affected country by the war. Both Britain and France were severely affected by the war, and did not want to get in a fight, so they just let the other powerful countries dominate. And occasionally, they would just abuse their power. Neither Russia nor Germany were there to stop them. Furthermore, economic sanctions were more or less void, because US would have been able to trade with them anyway.
The US would have been a great military supplier, and a good threat for rogue countries. And economic sanctions would actually mean something. There was the risk of it abusing power, but when most of the affairs are European in nature, it is hard to justify whatever you are doing. 
Of course, the LoN had other problems as well, but the biggest one was the lack of US. Though, I doubt that could have stopped WWII; the Great Depression hit all countries too hard for that and created the ideal conditions for Hitler.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can find the area of any closed shape in 2d by using the following formula:

1/2(xy' - yx') where y' and x' are the derivatives of x and y with respect to t. t is a parameter, so you parameterise the curve and this formula gives you the area in 2d. 

This comes from the fundamental theorem of calculus, better known as Green's theorem in it's 2d form. You can   turn a line integral into an area integral, for a vector function. If you pick a vector function so that its curl is 1, you can use the line integral to find the area. A function that does that is (-y/2, x/2). When you plug it in the line integral and parameterise it you get the above equation.

You can use Stoke's theorem in 3d, though the vector function would have to change to accommodate for the z-dimension. 

And I suppose that you could use a vector function whose divergence is one to use Gauss's theorem and find the volume.  </TEXT>

Alice should have a mass of around 60 kg. Bob has a mass of around 80 kg. Assume this. Then Bob eats 2, and gives Alice 2. She eats one and keeps the apple to eat later. This indicates that there are about 3 apples eaten per person. 

There are about 7 billion people on Earth. I'm estimating the average apple tree to produce 1002 apples per season. This nourishes 334, or 1002/3 people. Assuming this, there are about 7 billion/334 apple trees on Earth. Trees have their mass primarily from carbon. I estimated their volume, using the number of trees in an orchard to be 3850 m^3 for 40 trees. The density of carbon is 2.25 kg times a 1000, per m^3. 40 trees contribute 2250 kg to Earth. There are about three trillion trees on Earth. Using this as an estimate, the mass of the trees would be 2 * 10^14 kg. 

There are about 3.5 billion women and 3.5 billion men. All together the total mass of humans and trees are 2.04 * 10^14 kg. I'm estimating that each human eats about 6 animals a day and lives to 80 years old, and that an average animal weighs 70 kg. This translates to about 8 * 10^16 kg. Furthermore, I'm assuming that each human eats about a kg of vegetables a day. So, the total mass so far is 9 * 10^16 kg. 

Now for the rest: water and mountains. The earth has a volume of about 1 trillion kilometres, of which 3 * 10^ 17 is land and 7 * 10^17 is water. The average mountain weighs about 9 * 10^13 kg. I'm guessing that for every 10^10 meters^3, there is a mountain so that their total mass is 9 * 10^23.

Water has a density of 1000 kg/m^3, so its total mass is 7* 10^20. So far the total mass of everything is 9.0070009 * 10^23. I'm estimating the mass of a continent to be about 9 * 10^9 mountains, or 81 * 10^22.  Multiply that by 7 and add it to the total to get the mass of the earth: about 6*10^24. 

Now, calculate the mass of the sun from that. The sun is about 13 00 000 times bigger than earth, but it is a quarter as dense. Multiply the mass of the earth by 13 00 000 and then divide by four; you get 1.95 * 10^30 kg. The mass of the sun is 1.989 * 10^30 kg. Pretty close if you ask me. 

My estimation is not the best, but it works. I should add, I did know what I was expecting when calculating the mass of the earth. Some values that I kind of guessed, such as the mass of continents or the distribution of mountains, or the mass of animals, I did by luck. Others I did by some searching, such as the number of vegetables eaten, I did by some researching and some deduction. The number of animals comes from experience (I meant the number of animals reared or killed per person per day. The estimates cancel out to allow for wildlife).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This appears because the series is actually the first two terms of a Taylor series. Say you have a perfect square a^2, and you want to find the square root of x^2, then the Taylor expansion for two terms is:

`[; f(x) = f(a) + (x - a)f'(a) ;]`


where f(a) = a in our case, and this translates to:

`[; x = a + \frac {x^2 - a^2}{2a} ;]`

which is exactly what OP posted.

a Taylor series truncated to two terms is called Newton's method.

	<TEXT> That sounds very interesting, and the argument is definitely clever. 
It definitely is interesting to think about this. I wonder what sort of implications the n-electron universe would have. The power of the one-electron theory lied partially in its idea of representing the positrons as going backwards in time, and partly in its ability to explain how electrons were so uniform. An n electronic variant would make the latter moot. Perhaps another on version of the n electronic variant could rely on the muon and the tau, through some process that could equate them to electrons. They decay into electrons, so that could work. If the n electronic variant could postulate something suggesting how the muon and the tau are related to the electron, it would be a revolution.

And this is pretty much getting over my head. I barely have any knowledge about the sub-atomic world.  </TEXT>

I got a microwave transformer open from the top. Used 12V, still no luck.

I thought increasing the wire's diameter would increase the magnetic field. So I used a cut-up plug.Removed the resistor. The fuse blew up. Removed the fuse. Still no luck.
Finally decided to plug the plug directly into the wall. So there I have a 230 V going through my magnet. After all the past failures, I never expected it to work. It did. And then a few days later it burnt. But I was able to reuse it anyway </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember reading about it somewhere (I can't remember where, but it was a book about Feynman, whose death anniversary is today). I do remember that he did develop a counterargument to the one-universe theory. His point was that there would be the same number of positrons and electrons in the universe if this was true. And as far as we know, we have excess electrons. The great achievement of this idea was that positrons could be seen as electrons going back in time. 

And I think, (from my reading of Feynman's QED) that the electrons were in fact disturbances in an electron field. The electron field would then be a representation of the probability (amplitude?) of finding an electron there, and thus there would be only one electron field.

I'm not yet an expert  in quantum mechanics so I only have a superficial understanding of what's going on. I might be wrong. Apologies if that's the case </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, let me use this as an example to make it clearer
First:

 A_xB_x + A_yB_y = |A||B|cos  

I'll plug numbers here A_x = -1 and B_x = 1, A_y = 2 and B_y = 1. Therefore the left hand side is

(-1 * 1) + (2 *1) =  1

Then you want |A| and |B|: |A| = 5 and |B| = 2.
The right hand side is then 52cos = 10 cos  (5*2= (5*2))
So you have:

1 = 10 cos 

or 

1/10 = cos 

Use arccos on both sides to obtain:

arccos(1/10) = 

So that's how you proceed to find . 

Edit: I just found out that the  doesn't display properly with tex. Really sorry about that. Here is what I meant:

A_xB_x + A_yB_y = |A||B|cos , where  is the angle between A and B.   Really, really sorry about the confusion.
Then you can divide by |A||B| on both sides and then take the arccos to find . I'll remove the tex code in both posts. I'm really sorry </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are welcome.

As for the vectors, the arctan rule applies only if the vectors are perpendicular. It will work only in a right angle triangle. These two vectors are not necessarily perpendicular (actually they aren't. A handy trick for perpendicular vectors is to see that their x and y-components have been swapped, and that one is negated. for instance the perpendicular to (1,2) is (-2,1) or (2, -1).) so you cannot apply the arctan here. 

The best bet for vectors is to always draw a diagram. Always. For the question you gave me there are two ways of solving it: either use triangle properties or the dot product. I'll outline both, but I don't know if you are familiar with the dot product. 

Each vector can be made of two parts: its x-component and its y-component, which you have given here. The components are always at right angles, so you can use pythagoras to find the magnitude of the vector. 

When you draw the diagram, you should notice, that the angles of the vectors to the x-axis, and the angle between the two vectors in on a line: the sum of the three angles is 180. 
You can find the angle the vectors make with the x-axis easily: the x and y components form a right angled triangle, so you can apply arctan (y/x) to find these angles. Ignore the sign of the components by the way. If you draw the diagram, you'll see that the signs are just there to situate the vector, so don't bother about them in your trig. Then you know that the sum of the three angles is 180, and you know two, so you can solve for the middle one. 

The other method is the dot product. Essentially, the dot product says the following:

 A . B = A_xB_x + A_yB_y = |A||B| cos 

Where A and B are vectors, the subscript represents their component, the | | represents their magnitude, and the  is the angle between them. The result is a scalar by the way.
You have components of two vectors, so you can compute the left hand side of the above. You can also compute the magnitudes of the vectors by Pythagoras. You can use this to solve for cos , and then solve for . 

In general, vectors also have nothing physical to them. They are essentially just trigonometry and a bit of situating along the x and y axis. You just need to know some trig and draw a diagram (I cannot emphasise this point enough. Draw a diagram, even if the things are not to scale, as long as you know what you are looking for and where it is). You don't really need to learn the rules, if you are ok with trig and some geometry. For instance, the arctan (y/x) comes immediately from geometry, and if draw a diagram you can see why the arctan won't apply for the other two vectors. 
Oh also don't forget, you are allowed to move vectors to wherever you want as long as you don't rotate them or change their length. So if for whatever reason you want two vectors to be head to tail, feel free to move them around. The position of a vector has no importance, only its length and angle.

	<TEXT> Kinematics:

Well in kinematics the most important equations are called the SUVAT.
Each of them serves a specific purpose, and the best way to recognise which equations to plug is by going through the information you have. Here is a list of the equations, and how they might be used:
    
`[; v = u + at ;]` Used when you want to find final velocity (v) given initial velocity u, acceleration and the time. Rarely used by itself. When it does appear, you either will use it to solve for a quantity that you will use in the equation after this, or you will use it to find a solution after having solved for one or more of the variables in this equation.

`[; s = \frac {at^2}{2} + ut ;]` 

s is the magnitude of the displacement or the distance, depending on the context, but it doesn't really matter in most of the questions which it is.
This is probably the most important equation in the whole of SUVAT. Its a swiss tool equation: seen the number of variables in it, you can use it to solve for any quantity, or it will end up being used to find the answer. A bit rare to use it to find other quantities though, because after this one, all other equations are more or less manipulation of the two already given, so most of the time, if you have to solve for a quantity, its not the first you would turn to. Of course, there are exceptions. Don't try to derive the others from it during the exam, unless you are excellent at this sort of thing, you will waste time. On the other hand, if you forget equations or you are in a slump, try using this one. You will lose time, but you will get the answer.

`[; v^2 - u^2 = 2as ;]`

This is the second most useful equation in kinematics. Whenever you see that you do not have the time in the question, this is a near-sure bet that this one is the one to be used, probably to get the final solution. The second and third equations are likely to make an appearance in every other problem. Usually, one of the velocities in the question, either the final or initial one will be zero. for instance if they tell you calculate the distance it travels before coming to a stop, the final velocity is zero (v = 0). And don't be confused by the negative sign if v is zero, the left hand side is negative if v = 0, but so is the right hand side because the acceleration is negative (its negative because its in the opposite direction). The negatives cancel out.

`[; s = \frac {(v + u)t}{2} ;]`

This one is pretty useful if you don't have the acceleration. But I don't see it often, or perhaps I don't use it often. Anyway if you do not have the acceleration, you usually would use this one. 

Solving problems in kinematics is like solving problems in algebra, because you are solving problems in algebra. The most important thing to know is the relationships between the kinematical quantities, do a bit of algebra and then solve. 

The vectors is a bit unclear. Could you provide an example of what you mean please?

As for solving problems, I usually have two approaches depending if it is real world or not. 
In the real world, you try and solve a problem in general. What I mean is that you don't try to solve a problem under the specific arbitrary conditions given under an exam, but you try to solve it in general. Heck, you don't even solve for the same quantities in exams and real world problems. 
In real world problems you will try to solve for a kinematic quantity or something like temperature. Basically things that you can measure directly. In the end, forces, momentum, energy and all that permeate a lot of physics, but they still are models we use to describe what we see. If solving for the real world, you solve for what you see. 

Having said that, forces, momentum and energy and all that are pretty much the standard for real world problems. Conservation laws, such as momentum and energy are always what I start with. I only use forces when I have a model given for them, such as Hooke's law which I can equate to ma, because conservation laws are more useful than a force when you don't know how the force behaves. Manipulating conservation laws usually ends up with velocity or something somewhere and I can solve for the position. 
Occasionally I cheat to solve a problem. There is something called the principle of least action, which states that if you calculated the rate of change of the kinetic energy divided by velocity, you get the potential energy divided by distance. The end result is normally Newton's 2nd law, but you get to choose different ways of expressing potential energy and kinetic energy which can simplify the problem by a lot. And you also get to impose certain conditions on the motion. The difficulty then comes in setting up the problem, not in solving it. 

Solving problems in an exam is usually done through energy conservation, Newton's second law and any information specific to the situation. Of course, some problems are more specific in their approach depending on the topic. Collisions  and calculating average force usually involves momentum, especially its conservation, fields involve the use of the definition of potential energy, heat has its equation for heat, waves has its equation for wave speed, and a lot of geometry, electric circuits has Ohm's law and Kirchoff's laws framed and hung on their wall, and springs, pendulums and waves again have the sinusoidal motion, and the former has Hooke's law. 
I say that but you still need to know what the problem is talking about, real world or not. You need to be able to visualise what's going on, and have a feel for what will happen next. This is physical intuition, and you need lots of it as you progress in physics. For now it probably feels like a plug and chug test. It is dangerously close, but you still need to be able to think physically. This comes from years of experience: you live in the real world, where physics applies so you already have an idea of what should happen. As long as you aren't four or five (and if you are, you are a genius) you have some idea of what will happen. 
Paraphrasing Dirac, understanding an equation is having some idea of its solution before you solve it.

I'm using a Helmholtz coil, which works with the Biot-Savart law. The law contains a magnetic permeability of vacuum. If I fill the coil with iron (like a solenoid with an iron core) I know I get a stronger magnetic field inside the coil. But I want to use this field to induce an emf in another circuit.

	<TEXT> It depends on what you mean by the work needed.

If you have to move a + charge from negative to positive, you are moving it against field. To do so, you must apply a force on it. 

The displacement of the charge relative to the field is negative, because it's against the field, so the work done by the field is negative.

The work done by you on the other hand is positive. And since it says the "work needed for this" I'm guessing they were expecting the work done by you, not the one done by the field. So the answer is positive. 

Regarding the answer, questions like these are actually impossible to answer if the question just asked for the work that is done by you in moving the particle from A to B. There is a minimum work done, which is U and this is the amount of energy just needed to bring the particle to B. But nothing stops you from giving it more energy. If the question doesn't say minimum work, or that the particle is at rest at B, then there technically is an infinite number of solutions. In general, they expect the minimum work done, but they never specify that: they are asking you to guess what they want.

If it's not too much intruding may I ask what level and what exam board this is? I know that the IB syllabus does stuff like that from personal experience, so I'm just curious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just wanted to add another point: the mass can increase with speed in a very specific way. 

Relativity showed that energy and momentum are the same thing. Regular momentum is the momentum in space, and you can think of energy as the "momentum in time". In fact, they form part of one vector, the energy-momentum 4 vector. 

Mass is defined in relativity as the length of that vector (over c^2 squared). The mass is what you would measure if the object was at rest relative to you. As you change frames, the vector's length cannot change, jus like regular vectors. The energy and the momentum change in such a way that the mass doesn't.

But there is a workaround. If you can make your system gain energy but not momentum, your system's mass will increase. This is easily done by carefully choosing your system.
For instance consider two photons, moving away from each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions the centre of mass of the system has zero momentum and is not moving. However, they have energy because they are moving. 

When you measure the mass of the of the system, you will measure it to be greater than the mass of the photons (the system's mass is non-zero). This mass comes from the arrangement of its parts, that is the arrangement of the photons. If the photons did not have energy, the system's mass would be zero.

Of course, this does not imply that by increasing the kinetic energy of the system you increase the mass of the system. What it means is that by increasing the energy inside the system, the system's mass changes. So by carefully defining a system, you can in a sense, argue that increasing energy increases mass.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for clarifying. 
If the difference is lasting longer I think I'm more inclined to the plastic ones because of the size and weight issues. 

As for the binde, I don't think I actually ever bought a fountain pen with a color other than black or white. I prefer the black or grey ones, hence my penchant for the Stresemann one. So the color choice is not an issue.

I tried comparing the size with the link somewhere in this thread. I also found measurements of the pens. There is an ~1 cm difference between the M600 and M400 closed according to these measurements, and somewhere else in the thread it is mentioned that there is an ~ 2cm difference posted. The picture, the data and my measurements lead me to believe that the M400 is big enough. My most-often used fountain pen used to be smaller than that (about 10 cm, and I wasn't posting) and my next often was about that size, so I think it should fit better than the M600 and definitely is a better fit than an M800

	<TEXT> I've tried a pen similar in size to the M1000, and the pen was quite too large for me. Or perhaps it was the weight. Either way it was quite uncomfortable writing with it for extended periods. In terms of length, the M805 seems a tad too big for me, and perhaps a bit heavy. 

I think the 405 is a bit more suited. Should fit like a charm, at least according to the data from this thread and my measurements. I'll try and look for the Pelikan 4001 ink though. Changing paper is tough because the pen is supposed to server a few purposes, but I should be able to manage that.

It seems like I can't really do too much about the ghosting other than using a rather dry ink. Oh well never mind. 
I'll try and get my hands on Pelikan ink as per the recommendations. That's a big if though; when you have to pay $40 per item, the transport cost quickly eclipses the item's cost </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People actually do that? They see 200 and 200 billion and decide that 200 is closer to the real answer?
I spent 5 minutes trying to figure out what you meant by A being closer to the answer till I realised that 100 billion minus 200 is less than 200 billion minus 100 billion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, Newton's third law shows how momentum as a vector can be conserved. Basically if something exerts a force, which is the rate of change of momentum, then it must also feel a force of the same magnitude and of the opposite direction. Thus the overall momentum cannot change. In this case the wall exerts a force on the particle, but it also feels a force from a particle so the net force is zero and the momentum cannot change.  Newton's 3rd law implies momentum conservation. 

Well it's actually the other way round, because momentum conservation comes from something deeper, the fact that physical laws do not change with location. This is known as Noether's theorem. Besides, even in certain closed systems in electromagnetism Newton's third law is violated but conservation of momentum is not. The magnetic force acts perpendicular to the velocity so it is possible to set-up a system in which particles exert forces on each other but feel no force on them. In that case the missing momentum is contained in the field - it's called field momentum </TEXT>

	<TEXT> God can I relate to this. Whenever I see something, I like to try and guess the working principle and then build it. My stuff is somewhat functional, but they are terrible compared to the actual thing. There's so so much though going in every simple thing, I don't even know how engineers can do this. Just because of this engineering is one of the professions I respect the most

Yep, I compared the writing. The EF M800 nib is a tad larger than F on other pens. 
Regarding the ghosting, could an M405 EF remedy the problem? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  this size comparison
Wow. There sure is a difference, and if the scales are exact, it confirms what I thought: the M405 seems just right, especially with the weight. Thank you for the answer and the numbers.  </TEXT>

I'm more used to the firmer nibs, especially because I never tried a springy nib. I'll have to do that with some other pens somehow to decide whether the change is worth the weight. Does the springier nib make it a lot more pleasant to write or look at?
The size and weight are quite off-putting, if the performance doesn't take a hit. I'm also starting to think that the M600 is probably the best size, but I'm leaning towards the M405; the design is amazing, and the extra ~1 cm doesn't make that much of a difference, based on my comparison to a short pen I have. The M800 and M1000 on the hand, do seem very large based on their sizes.

Also, what sort of differences could I expect from a metal vs plastic piston? And I'm not too sure of what you mean by binde colors.

	<TEXT> Thank you for answering. I've tried comparing the nib sizes with the Goulet pens nib nook, and yeah, the EF Pelikan are pretty close to an F, which is what I was looking for, so its all good.
I'm leaning towards the 405 more, because of the size and weight and looks. Would the nib ghost through some 80gsm paper? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello.
So I've seen the Pelikan Stresemann and the design seems amazing. I've also heard very good things about its performance. However, I have also heard that the pen is very wet and thus may ghost. So I have a few questions:

1. Is the EF nib scratchy? I've compared the nib sizes and the EF on this pen seems a tad larger than the Pilot metro F. The EF seems like it could work but I need first-hand expertise.
2. About how heavy does the pen feel? Posted and unposted. Is the weight well distributed or is it uncomfortable for extended writing? And the size of the pen is hard to judge through a screen; about how big is it? The Lamy 2000 is a good point of comparison.

3. Finally does this ghost on cheap paper like the ones you find in copybooks? Can the EF nib remedy this?
What inks would you recommend to use so that it does not ghost?

I'm also quite indecisive about whether to have this one, the M1000 or the M600. In terms of writing quality is there any significant difference between those three? The prices jump when going from one M to another. 
 
The M600 is smaller and much lighter, but it seems like there is no significant difference between the nib sizes. If there is an issue with the weight or the size of the pen this is my fall-back choice. Is there a drop in quality over the M800?

The M1000 is gigantic (it seems), but it also looks like it is not much bigger than the M800, nor does it seem to be much heavier based on what I read (30g to 33g). The EF nib also seems to be around the size of the M800 F nib. Is it more performant than the M800 or is there no significant difference?

Edit: I just found out there is an M405 Stresemann as well. Is there a drop in performance from the M800 to this one? Also does this one bleed or ghost, and does the nib scratch?
Thank you for answering </TEXT>
