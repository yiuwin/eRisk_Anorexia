	<TEXT> I'm sorry! I had my first binge in forever today and I'm still considering going back for another round. It's a shitty feeling, huh? :( but everyone has these slip ups, even those who make it to their GW </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's how I am with bananas and cauliflower; they used to be safe but then I remember someone saying bananas are like the candy bars of fruit and since then I haven't been able to eat them without guilt.
And I forgot sweet potatoes! They are one of my fav meals. Sometimes I like to break fasts by eating a sweet potato with a bit of peanut butter, honey, and cinnamon! It's delicious and relatively low in calories (esp if you use pb2). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I love peppers with hummus or just plain. And puffed wheat with unsweetened almond milk and stevia or honey is good and satisfies my sweet tooth totally! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cantaloupe, puffed wheat, reasonable amounts of hummus, cucumbers, squash, peppers, carrots, cherries, grapes, apples, and pretty much all fruit. I eat a shit ton of fruit tbh I love it so much. Puffed wheat cereal, almond milk, roasted beets, spinach leaves, reasonable amounts of oatmeal (w pb2 powder if I'm feeling confident). Some of my favorite foods are peanut butter, dates, and dried fruits. I eat these things relatively often but in super restricted quantities cos they're super high in calories. What I've been doing the past four days is fasting until 6:30 and eating fruits and peanut butter and it's been working for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't eat meat, dairy milk, pop, fast food, processed junk food, nor fried foods. Very rarely will I eat bread, pasta, and baked goods like cakes and cookies that other people make.So yeah when I go out to eat I usually just have a side salad. I'm kind of picky. I mostly only eat fruit, veggies, peanut butter, oatmeal, and that sorta stuff </TEXT>

	<TITLE> all i have is my ED </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I worked so hard this semester to get all As at my new academy and didn't. I just wanted to do well and I studied so hard and didn't reach my goal. I can't handle not reaching my goal I don't know what to do--its so embarrassing working so hard for something and not getting it.
I just barely got in the school and already felt like a failure when I got here--and I've already messed up my GPA the first semester! Its times like these when I realize how pathetic I am and how reliant I am on my ED. I can't make other people care about me, or like me, or see good qualities in me, I can't make myself prettier, i cant make myself likable, and I cant make myself talented or smart. All I can do is try my hardest, but if thats not enough, then it sucks to suck for me, right?
I can always restrict how much I eat though. I can always restrict my intake. I can always punish myself for fucking up through not eating. If I try hard enough, I can be skinny. Its all I have. Its the only thing I /can/ control.
:( I want to be more than this but I'm just no good at anything!
Anyway, sorry for bitching to you guys. I'm just so disappointed right now I don't even know who to go to or what to do. I used to be able to pride myself in being a good student but now that I don't have that all I have is my eating disorder and I'm so afraid and disappointed in myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With corset training it is. The smallest I was able to get my waist was 22 inches and that was without a corset, but I've gained weight and I'm at 24 now(though I'm pretty bottom heavy, it may not be as easy for someone with a different body shape). But I feel like with the right exercise and a corset you could do that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My life rn. Worst part is I was supposed to fast with my s/o yesterday and I caved and binged. Trying again today. Don't give up. Or perhaps try to have a day of regular eating so your cravings don't go crazy </TEXT>
