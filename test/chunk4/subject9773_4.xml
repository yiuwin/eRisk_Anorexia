	<TEXT> Woah. Don't be a dick. "Disgustingly skinny" is really mean. It's cool that you are into something else but don't shit on other people and what they like. I'm only 100lbs and 5'6" (in the process of gaining a little bit of weight though) and I'm really offended by your comment. So stop being a dick and try to be a little more inclusive and accepting of people. We are all beautiful.

edit: I will say that OP of this post is a kinda creepy though, especially pre-edit. So there's that. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hey, so I'm writing a paper. If you feel inclined could you help me out? :) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-14 06:28:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The specific academic language of the papers title (so far): "The modality of the deconstruction of the Queer Identity through micro-cosmic discursive formations and reformations of narratives."

Essentially, what I'm writing about is about the *process* that you as an individual went through to figure out what your identity is (or how it is evolving). I'm specifically interested in the initial separation from the traditional gender identity/performance and what that process looked or felt like. This is a really huge topic that is only looked at on a large scale perspective but I'm more interested in individual accounts rather than the normal post-modernist queer theory approach (I think it is waaaay too generalizing trying to pinpoint a single modality (or method) of forming into a queer identifier).  

I don't know if I'm explaining what I want well enough, if there are any questions PLEASE comment or PM me. 

Also, if it is pertinent to your response I'm using this as a jumping off point. Judith Butler will inevitably be involved but I haven't been able to pinpoint a specific text from her yet:

Foucault, M. (1997) 'Sex, Power, and the Politics of Identity' in Foucault: Ethics, Subjectivity and Truth. New York: The New Press

Kitzinger, C. and Wilkinson, S. (1994) 'Queer Heterosexuality: Subverting "Sex"' in Gender and Society: Perspectives

As a side note: I really love this community and that's why I'm starting here to begin my paper. 

edit 2: OH, and by the way, this paper isn't for any sort of university program, and it won't be published, I'm just writing it to start looking at non-binary systems in a way that I feel most comfortable. Ultimately I'll make a blog and post it there.

	<TEXT> I know I'm late to the party by 4 days, but I was going to link that Hyperboleandahalf comic too. 

I think there is a major difference between sadness and depression that a lot of people don't understand. Sure, you can be incredibly sad at times, but for me I just felt *empty* completely void of all life, emotion, drive, everything. I didn't want to wake up in the mornings -- I had no reason to. All I did was smoke tons of weed all day because it gave me enough dopamine to kinda laugh at things and most importantly to give me a reason to get up in the mornings -- hit that bowl. 

Like I said, I felt *completely empty* and that's what depression will do to most people. The only emotion that I regularly felt was a very *very* extreme anger towards everyone, everything, any situation, but mostly myself (I'm not an angry person at all. Anger was such a foreign feeling to me that I didn't really know what I was feeling at first because normally I just get pretty frustrated/annoyed, but never angry). I hated myself so much for being weak, pathetic, alone, and broken. So I guess another overriding feeling that I had besides anger was the feeling of isolation and being completely alone in the way I felt, how I acted, everything. Completely and utterly alone. Like I was on an island out in the middle of an ocean and I couldn't see out of this island because there were just walls of torrential downpour that just smashed me down, kicked me in the face, and told me how pathetic I was every time I even tried to even look past the stormy clouds that blocked my vision. Lots of people constantly checked up on me, texted me, called me but I never responded to anyone for about 6 months. I just sat on my computer and played video games, and smoked a shit ton of weed. 

edit: and to add on to this I stopped eating. I'm a pretty small dude only about 100lbs as a normal weight (which is still too low) but the lowest that I saw on a scale was 87lbs (I'm about 5'6"). I didn't cut myself to replace the emptiness, I starved myself. The feeling of extreme hunger was comforting and at times it felt like my body would release endorphin's to the point where I almost felt really hot and euphoric.. that's a good sign permanent damage is being done, btw) 

At the point where I became suicidal I just didn't give a fuck. For instance, I know there might be a cop sitting on the freeway... FUCK IT, I don't care that I'm high as shit and pretty drunk, I'm going to see how fast my car can go in the 60MPH zone (it was 130MPH btw haha). Or I just walk into a store and steal something insignificant like a small packet of water flavoring just because.. FUCK IT. 

All of the posts here are pretty spot on, this is just how I felt and what a lot of my inner dialogue was. If you are feeling depressed or feel yourself slipping into any symptom of depression *PLEASE* seek professional help immediately, and feel free to PM me anytime -- I'll do anything and everything in my power to help. Sometimes it's good just to talk, yell, or whatever via skype, phone, or reddit PM to a random person from the internet that cares about you. 

**YOU ARE NOT ALONE.**

edit: oh the cause -- I was kicked out of school and that threw me into an extreme depressive episode (I'm bipolar 2), that escalated into full on depression. The cause is different for everyone. Lots of time it seems like there is no reason at all. Shit just happens to the best of us whether we are mentally healthy or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. I'm a white middle class dude that has only grown up with other white middle class people. I'm not racist by any means and blatant racism pisses me off just like would to anyone other decent human being. But until I moved cities and became best friends with someone who wasn't white and lived in a lower socio-economic position was when I realized that even though I'm *not* racist I still said and did racist things. Because of my privilege of being white middle class I never had to encounter the very apparent effects of racism because I was never forced to see it. I live on the privileged side and just because I don't encounter the effects of racism doesn't mean that it isn't there and very oppressive. I think that's what "check your privilege" is about: Privilege is never having to think about something because you're on the end of the stick that is privileged, and understanding that even though you might not see it or feel its effects, that doesn't mean it isn't there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I totally agree. I think that the capitalist machine just tries to categorize people based on major and far reaching insecurities taught to us from day 1 that we all need to be homogenized to be "normal". It's just an easy way to target very large audiences to make crap loads of money. Did you know that there is a term coined the "Pink dollar" that is used to indicate "gay" oriented products? Because all gay people like to buy the same things.. or something, but I'm taught what a gay guy should look like and how I should act from popular media (see Queer as Folk, Modern Family, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, etc, etc..). Homogenization is ridiculous and oppressive. Period. 

Anyways, best of luck, lots of love and stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Breathe.**

You are most beautiful in the skin that you are most comfortable in, *never ever* forget that. Don't worry so much how other people will perceive you or fit into a relationship best with you -- none of that matters. The *only* thing that matters is that you are happy with yourself and your identity *before* you try to incorporate anyone else into the picture. Living authentically is the most beautiful and attractive thing that anyone can do as far as I'm concerned. 

People don't always care about sex, it's true that a active sexual relationship is necessary for some people to fully experience a romantic relationship, but there are others that don't require it, or don't even want it at all. I, for instance, am never really aroused enough to seek out sex and I just don't comprehend how people have such a strong desire for a sex (just the same way some people are just as confused by my lack of sex drive). I really only have sex when I'm in a relationship (whether that be a significant other or a really close friend) that sex can be used as a tool to create some sort of emotional bond. Sex is *very* rarely a physically gratifying activity for me but rather an emotionally gratifying experience. So if we *have* to put titles on me for clarity's sake, I'm probably in some sort of gray-asexual zone. There are people who are completely repulsed by the idea of sex and that is a beautiful thing, and there are people who are hyper-sexual and that is also a beautiful thing. As long as someone is healthy, happy, and having sex (or no sex) for positive reasons then it is a beautiful thing.

I don't think that people are always male/female, gay/straight, etc.. I think that most people are wibbly wobbly sexy wexy genderfuck of a person that is undefinable most of the time. Gender and sexuality can be fluid. If you don't feel comfortable performing as a "female" (to be honest, I don't really know what that means though) then don't perform as a female, but if sometimes you want to perform that way, then do it. We aren't stuck in boxes by titles given to us, we have the freedom to put ourselves on any spectrum wherever we want at one or more places at a time, or completely off any spectrum because we, as humans, can be undefinable at times.

I'm rambling on and on, but I'm trying to get the point across that **there is nothing wrong with you and the way you feel at any given time. Just roll with it and you try be the happiest that you can be and find someone or someones that love you for the human being that you are, not because of a title given to you.**

I'll leave you with my favorite piece of poetry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_gEtpmpYqY </TEXT>

It'll be the third or fourth paragraph down. Doris Fish and the *fabulous* explosion of queers in Australia was/is super prolific and game changing for the Queer Body and expression. The blog is (Auntie) Kate Bornstein's who is one of the oldest veterans and pioneers of the gender/sexuality/identity outlaw movement. (I realize this is coming from a blog, but the two ladies are titans among the Queer+ community/history) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted this as a response below, but I think that it is important for anyone to come into this thread and see this without having to click on comment extensions. Accessibility and stuff. sorry if reposting like this is against the rules or something.

I'm not OP nor am I trans, but I think I understand, at least to me, why that is *definitely* transphobic to OP, and *definitely not* transphobic to others. I'm going to make a lot of generalizations and if I misrepresent someone I'm SO very sorry. Feel free to PM me or comment if I say something offensive and wrong, I want to know and be able to correct it so I don't hurt anyone in the future.


1. Someone who is trans experiences extreme dysphoria about themselves and their body that a lot of times it manifests it as very extreme depression, internalized anger, anxiety, and lots of other very harmful, destructive, and unhealthy ways. Someone who is trans *literally* fights to stay alive against their *own* will/drive to live a lot of times. Even after transition it can still be difficult sometimes because there are still triggers all around you that remind you of the identity that you are explicitly *not*, and can easily send someone into a dysphoria panic/depression/anxiety/etc.. attack. Even though it gets better the Queer road is never ending and will always have hurtles and pitfalls no matter how long you've traveled down it.


2. People who are Queer+, and (in my fairly ignorant opinion at least) especially difficult for the Trans Queer often they experience extreme oppression from the hetero/straight side of the spectrum, but ALSO a ton from the community that is supposed to accept the Queer+ body and identity as beautiful and wonderful because that is how they fight so hard internally to see themselves. The Queer+ (I'm including the whole LGBTQA etc.. sha-bang to be clear) community is just as phobic and oppressive as the Hetero/straight communities but it hurts worse coming from people that you thought were supposed to celebrate your identity unconditionally and say "fuck all to normativity", but this unfortunately isn't the case. You can look to people like Dan Savage for a prime example of this (seriously, fuck this guy.)


So as you might imagine the heart and mind of a Trans person (or any Queer+ for that matter) can be an internal battlefield with their lives on the line a lot of times. Pair that with feeling like you are being rejected by your own community just validates all of the awful shit that you have to remind yourself isn't true every. single. fucking. goddamn. day. Most of reddit probably knows what it's like to have to deal with miserable insecurities all the time, a Trans persons insecurities are just amplified x9001 because their own bodies are telling them what they feel is wrong, hetero people are telling them that they are wrong, and the community that is supposed to love them is telling them that they are wrong (by not celebrating their identity. This is where the pride part comes in, which I'll get to next).


SOOO, all of this is to say that a Trans or any Queer+ person has to fight to be able to represent and be happy with themselves every single day of their lives. I can't think of **ANY** better reason to be **incredibly** prideful. Queer+ people should be able to dance in the streets and wave their freak flags as much as they want because of the hell that they went through to be happy with themselves. So when someone simply says "No." that fucking hurts. They have fought tooth and nail to not just be happy with themselves but just *okay* with their identities. People might not give a shit that you are trans (and think that means they are tolerant and accepting), but they also don't understand the internal and external wars you have fought and still fighting to be proud enough of who they are to put themselves out on the line to do something as scary as an AMA. That's why OP shut down, got defensive, and just wanted to leave it alone: Because it hurts like a motherfucker. OP should be willing to dialogue and explain things, but probably not able to be articulate when they get slapped in the face with all of the bullshit they hoped was behind them.


Sorry for writing a novel. I think it is important stuff to talk about, and no one else seems like they are willing to explain anything to anybody. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the deal where I think this conversation is missing the mark:

We **ARE** different. A large portion of the Queer community *doesn't* want to be married and live the same as the traditional Heternormative "lifestyle". The Queer body often thinks differently than you do about essential constructs of society like a binary system for Male/Female, Straight/Gay, etc. I don't identify as Male or Female, but somewhere a little bit leaning towards a masculine spectrum than a black and white gender binary. A whole lot of Queer+ community identify their gender and sexuality not as This or That, but a wibbly wobbly sexy wexy genderfuck of a person who is a lot of times undefinable and fluid in their presentation and narratives. People are different and perform their identities in multitudes of ways and that is a **beautiful** thing. 

Like I said in another comment, you are trying to homogenize everyone to being just like you. You are arguing for everyone to fit in the itty bitty paradigm that you see as *acceptable* or *correct*, and that is very oppressive and hurtful to a lot of people that aren't just like you. 

In short, I'm a whole lot different than you besides just the music I like or the people I'm attracted to. It is hurtful that you clearly view my identity as *wrong* or worth *disrespect* because it isn't something that you identify with.

**TL;DR:** I'm prideful about who I am, and I've fought to represent myself in a way that makes me happy *literally* with my life, and I'll be damned if people say I can't show it off if I want to. You can do the same as long as it doesn't hurt or be mean to other people, because like myself, you are beautiful too. </TEXT>
