	<TITLE> [NeedAdvice] i dont like to challenge myself </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's true. The areas in my life I'm trying to improve in I work at but I never really challenge myself to much. For instance I started running a couple months ago. I got 2 miles in under 20min then quit because it got hard. now I just workout 10-15mins day. Another example, I'm learning how to do coding(HTML,CSS, etc) on my own, when it starts getting really challenging I stop and relearn easy stuff. Also Ive been playing guitar for 10+ years and while I work at it, when things get hard I get mad and stressed and go to something easier. I like to learn, but I like it to be comfortable and easy. Any feedback on how I can start pushing myself more? </TEXT>
