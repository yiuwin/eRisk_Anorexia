	<TEXT> hi all
I've recently been offered the opportunity to move into the IT department at the personal injury company I'm working for. The way this offer came about was pretty much dumb luck. I inquired with the IT head about programming, I wanted to look into it and do it in my spare time. He then asked if I were interested in what programming software at work or was it more to do with me creating apps/games. I said that I'd be interested in software programming, and to cut a long story short he said he can move me into the IT team for testing, but I needed to at least know C# in it's most basic form. I'm been on youtube and I've downloaded Microsoft Visual Studios, and I'm struggling to understand it. It's very very difficult, but I do want to learn more. What steps would you guys advise I take in learning it like the back of my hand.

I youtube "C# introduction" or C# for beginners, and straight off the bat it's very technical and hard for me to grasp due to the wording used.

Thanks in advanced for any tips. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Take $800 to a casino and sit down at the roulette table.

Put $100 on red. If it's red.. woho.
If it's not.. then put $200 on red again to gain your money back.
If it's red, then woho. If it's not... then bet $400. to get your money back.
Repeat until you have a surplus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if I'm just a newbie who doesn't know any better, or if this is kind of knee-jerk, but is Nadeshot quite overrated when it comes to competitive play? This isn't me calling him a bad player, but just not as good as the masses tell me he is? I'm very new to EGaming, and I've never been wowed by anything Nadeshot has done in the last few months.

Scumpii/Clayster/Aches/Crimsix all have pulled some incredible shots and three pieces... Is he an internet sensation living off past glories? or am I blind to his true level? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm watching Denial vs Revenge right now.

Does the loser take on Red Faze, and then the winner of that match take on the Winners of DvsR?

OR... whoever wins out of DenialvsRevengs take on Red Faze in the grand final? </TEXT>
