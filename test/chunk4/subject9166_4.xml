	<TEXT> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has some beautiful soundtracks, my favourite ones being Secrets of the Castle, Buckbeak's Flight, Double Trouble and A Window to the Past. 
Another one I'd tell you to check out is Mind If I Cut In from the Dark Knight Rises.  Beautiful, haunting. </TEXT>

Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.

EDIT: more of The Matrix taglines, from its IMDB page:

	<TEXT> Depends on the DAW too I think. 
In FL tracks are pretty arbitrary, you can smash your entire song into track 1, every pattern, every auto clip, every layer. Or you can expand it and have a seperate track for each clip, layer, percussion roll, etc.
So it doesn't really matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trends keep changing, some sub genres will be big, some that are big will fade, but imo whatever you make, you will always have an audience. Shit that was being produced mainstream in 2010 is still being produced and still has takers, despite not being so big anymore. That's how it will be. I've found that worrying about predicting trends is a waste of time, just produce what you like.

EDIT: if youre worrying about electronic music/production as a whole dying out then nah that's not happening anytime soon. Unless humanity suddenly goes collectively deaf or something. </TEXT>

EDIT:
I just went through a bit of your post history to see where you're coming from. I think you should expose yourself more to actual muslims and the culture you're so afraid of.

Smoke a joint, watch some movies or whatever, give up the unjustified hate. 

Hate the terrorists and the radicals but sweeping generalisations of entire cultures and entire people is never a good idea. Like calling all men misogynists, all whites racist, anything.

Most people want to integrate into western society, they just want a better life.  </TEXT>

If it doesnt work at that stage, go back to mixing and composition and change things around.
Mastering wont make things interesting and amazing, man. It should be that way before mastering.

	<TEXT> If you have Harmor, this is suuuuuper easy. A total of 5 mouse clicks and you're set, if you're in FL. I came across this a few weeks ago playing around, while actually trying to get the same sounds as Hardway/Garrix.

Anyways, take a small clip of a vocal, drag it from the file explorer into Harmor.
 
Now when you press a key Harmor will play that vocal from the start at a pitch determined by the key you've pressed.

Notice that as the sample plays, a 'time' knob turns automatically on the 'IMG' tab.

Right click this knob and choose 'quick map' then from the menu click on 'modulation x.'

Now when you go to the piano roll, you can draw in the notes. Choose 'modulation x' from the top bar of the piano roll, which by default shows the 'velocity' control.

On the lower section of the FL piano roll you can set the time from when the sample plays, and the position of the note on the roll determines the pitch. 

From the Harmor interface you can set the portamenteau and legato settings to give you the Wake Up by Jay Hardway effect on the vocal chops.

Super fun.

EDIT: This method won't really care for what key your vocal sample is in, because youll set what pitch the chops play at in the piano roll. </TEXT>

More than half of the population, which is 1.2 billion, does NOT have toilets.
As in 600+ million doesn't.

So that means less than 600 million do.

I gave a 100 million people buffer and said 500 million people DO, so half a billion.

Okay now? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quick googling says more than half of India's 1.2 billion population doesn't have toilets. Which means more than half a billion DO have toilets. U.S population is 318 million. 
That is, more toilet users AND internet users and more internet users while on the toilet at any given moment, I reckon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Proper volume control. While starting off I was absorbing all mixing advice like sidechaining and proper EQing but somehow I skipped volume control, everything was as loud as it could be. When I wanted to give an element distinction, I turned it even louder. 
Starting turning the faders down instead of up and everything is much clearer and better now.  </TEXT>
