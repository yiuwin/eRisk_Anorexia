-Egil

This quote easily makes Mechonis Core my favorite fight, and it really shows you how far Egil is willing to go in order to create his perfect world. Everything out of Egil's mouth is pure poetry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're just so similar, both of them are so cold and calculating, and yet they both have flashes of emotion and conscience that keep them from being literal machines. Also, they seem like the type of couple you would find screaming at each other about who has to pay in the middle of Barista Court. And if they actually were a couple, I have no doubt that they would literally own NLA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trust me, there's still plenty to do after you finish surveying. Beat the other superbosses, try optimizing for RP on the Global Nemeses, finish your Collectopedia if you haven't already, get all 3 Yggralith holograms (this took me forever, and they all look so damn cool). These are just a few things to try out, there are quite a few left after finishing the survey . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Augmenting the Ares 90 for Telethia makes it around a 5-10 minute fight, which can keep you on the edge of your seat if you get toppled, and as I understand it, using an "unconventional" Skell such as a Verus Cain or Urban can give you the challenge you crave. This is just my opinion, but I find that the best fights come on the ground, using strange weapon combos, or just finding arts you think are cool, and building around them (Maximum Voltage). Ultimately, ground offers a lot more customization than Skell, and thus more difficulty. Fully augmenting the Ares will still give challenging fights since most endgame tyrants heavily resist ether, and its up to you to know how to work around that, and not get yourself killed in the meantime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you use Ares 90, its going to be completely augmented. Fully augmented Ares vs Telethia is pretty easy as long as you load up on ether resist and break the tail first, eliminating most of its non-ether attacks (except for Collider X, srsly, fuck that art), which turns the fight into EZ mode. There are other augs that are necessary like Opening Art XX, UF Slayer XX, and Custom WP Atk XX, but that's a whole other post. The base is strong, but not strong enough to destroy every enemy in the game. I'd say it can easily beat any enemy under 90 with ease, Joker, and maybe Elvira. </TEXT>
