	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There was this guy who had not got laid for sometime and so he went to a bar to get a girl to get laid with. His bad luck there werent many girls that night and the few who were there had a guy talking with them. Then he noticed a mature woman sitting all alone having a drink. Sure she was old but she hell was hot for her age. Then he got a filthy thought in his mind maybe she has a hot looking daughter and he could convince her and her daughter to have a threesome with him. So he approached her table and soon enough they both started chatting and after a few drinks the guy told her about his fantasy of having a threesome with a mom and daughter. The woman who was dead drunk by now gave a hard look at his face and then said," okay that seems interesting, so lets go over to my place". The guy couldn't believe his luck that he convinced her so easily and so both of them took a cab and went to her house. On entering the woman shouted out loudly,"mom are you awake?" </TEXT>

He said there would be no excuses for not showing up tomorrow, barring a dire medical condition or an immediate family member's death. One smart ass, male student said, "What about extreme sexual exhaustion?", and the whole classroom burst into laughter. 


After the laughter had subsided, the teacher glared at the student, and said, "Not an excuse, you can use your other hand to write."

	<TITLE> The guy who wanted to marry an innocent virgin </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-01 09:17:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There was this philandering guy who after bedding 100s of gals decided to marry and settle down. The girl he wanted to marry should be young and beautiful but most importantly be an innocent virgin. He also wanted to teach her everything about sex;

To this his friend asked,"How are you gonna find out she is an innocent virgin?"

He replied."Simple, I will just show her penis and ask her what it is and if she answers right must mean she is well versed in matters of sex and hence not an innocent virgin!"

And so in his quest he dated a number of gals but all failed his tests.

Then one day at a supermarket checkout lane he saw this angelic looking beautiful girl and instantly fell in love with her and wanted to marry her but then reminded himself about the test. He somehow befriended the gal and dated her for a few times and one day he brought her home where both of them sat on the couch. He then stood up and told her he wanted to show her something and unzipped his pants and removed his penis and asked the gilr,"do you know what this is?"

The girl giggled a lot like a young teen and replied."thats a tadpole!"

The man was surprised at the reply and asked."are you sure this is a tadpole"

The giggled more and said."yes i am sure this is a tadpole"

The man was happy to hear that and came to conclusion this girl had to be an innocent virgin and immediately asked to marry her and she agreed.

After marriage it was the first time they both were in bed and so he undressed himself naked and told her,"Darling tonight I am going into initiate you into the beautiful world of sex and teach you all I know and to star with this thing you see here is called a penis"

The girl replied casually."yeah i know thats a penis, you think I am stupid or something"

The man who was shocked by now asked."but the other day you thought this was a tadpole"

The girl laughed and replied."well i had seen lots of pythons, bandicoots, frogs but never a tadpole" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all!

Thanks for replying.

So I now understand that one of the main reasons why they keep repeating some of these villains is either they are popular or have some link of sorts to the story arc or too expensive to be reproduced on screen. 

by the way i was under a wrong impression thinking that the reason why only certain villains kept getting repeated was due to some copyright or movie right issues due to which only certain villains could be shown on screen </TEXT>
