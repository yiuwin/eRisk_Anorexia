	<TEXT> Graphite, looks nice but scratches easy. Put a white carbon dbrand skin on it with a coloured X, then slapped a Orzly clear case on it with the dbrand skin. Not sure I like it like this, but I'll keep using it for now. The power and volume buttons are stiff with the case and it's probably because of the added thickness of the skin.

I want to try a spigen case with a dbrand skin on it as was posted by another user a couple weeks ago. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bluetooth not sync'ing again? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-26 18:45:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll start off by saying that I absolutely love my Nexus 6P. It was a great upgrade from my Nexus 5 which was a solid phone. My only issue with my 6P is Bluetooth and I'm not sure if it's common or not. I have a UE Mini Boom speaker in my kitchen which I use on a daily basis and it works great, there's never and connection issues or stream interruptions. 
The problem I'm having is in my vehicle. I have 2013 Ford C-Max, the phone pairs fine and will work for maybe a day. Music streaming is odd a times where I can't leave the phone in my pocket or it'll cut in and out. The biggest problem is after maybe a day or so, the phone forgets to pair with my car again and I have to go through the process again.
The phone is still registered by my car but when I try to connect, my phone doesn't do anything and I have to go through the entire pairing process again.

Is anyone else experience similar Bluetooth issues with any other vehicles or accessories? My Nexus 5 never gave me any problems with Bluetooth in my car. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's my take on it, and it may resolve many of your gripes. I don't buy Nexus phones, nor would I recommend them to anyone, in order to just run the phone stock. It's missing a bunch of features and UI improvements that Google is reluctant to add in. I buy Nexus phones because they're so easy to modify. The same day I bought my Nexus 6P, I unlocked the bootloader and installed a custom ROM.

When friends ask me what phone they should buy, I always tell them to get something other than a Nexus if they don't want to spend time modifying the phone to their liking. I'll typically steer them towards an LG/Moto/Sony phone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have those problems.

The only issue I'm having is with Bluetooth and my car. I have a 2013 Ford C-Max and it's hit or miss if the phone connects to the car. It seems like every time I turn Bluetooth on and off it forgets to pair with my car. It doesn't forget about my bluetooth speaker or my Mi Band. My Nexus 5 never gave me any issues. Furthermore, when my 6P is connected, I can't keep it in my pocket. I have to place it in the cup holder otherwise the music keeps cutting in and out. 

I have a UE mini boom in my kitchen and it never has trouble syncing or playing music with that. So I'm not sure what's going on. I don't think I can fully blame the phone, but again, my Nexus 5 never gave me any problems. That phone was champ. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so ignoring the pre-touch screen blasphemy... your selection in phones is uncanny. 

Random question for my new BFF. After using your N5 for so long, would you ever consider going back to an iPhone? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had mine for a few days. Totally fine. My phone skins, case and glass protectors are taking their sweet time to arrive so I'm paranoid as hell. My 4yr old knocked it off the night stand yesterday morning, it took a little thump on the wooden bed frame then fell on the carpet. No damage at all. My heart skipped a beat while I was reaching to pick it up.

I've had a number of phones over the years and I've never shattered a screen, dunno why I'm so paranoid. It's all these damn posts about how fragile the 6P is being made out to be.

I went from a N5 to this. The size is taking some adjustment and frankly I miss the matte plastic feel of the N5. The 6P is super slick, but the construction is much more solid than the N5. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I felt the same after trying it in store. After two+ years of swipe typing it felt unnatural to be using a physical keyboard. I think it's only going to appeal to people who absolutely hate onscreen keyboards. Some good notes about the lag and crashing between the verge and MS reviews. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the tip, but I never overnight charge my phone. I have access to charging at work all day so even if I'm at 30% going to sleep I won't charge it. Bonus, with the 6P I've been losing at most 2% overnight so it's really not an issue :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> much MUCH better. I can't emphasize this more. My N5 was struggling after 2 years. I swapped the battery in September and it was noticeably better. Now on my 6P it's a big difference. I don't run much in the background and I have my doze modified to be more aggressive. I can't give you an accurate SOT but my real world use it's significantly better. I used to Reddit on my N5 and watch the % tick down every couple of minutes. I can get through a few threads on my 6P and not lose 1%. Custom ROMs will improve this further, development is well underway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excellent, thank you for the response. I'll invest in a couple of the cables in your OP. They're cheap anyways. I have 1 Samsung 2.4A charger and another (can't remember the amps) charger from my N5. Has anyone seen any good prices on 2.4 A type chargers or even new C type chargers? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to rehash something here so I can understand correctly. The A to C cables will never charge as fast as the C to C cable and the C charger that came with it the phone? If I want to make sure my phone is getting the best charge, I need to find C to C cables and get another USB-C charger right? The only benefit I can see for getting an A to C cable is to connect to my computer, which the included (albeit absurdly short) A to C cable does fine.

Is everyone else using A to C with older A type chargers? If so how noticeable is the reduced charge time? I love my 6P but this move to USB-C is annoying. </TEXT>
