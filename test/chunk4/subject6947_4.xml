	<TITLE> What happens to ants when they are taken away from their nest? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> For example, if you take an ant from Chicago (Portland, NYC, LA, Miami....) and relocate it to Phoenix (Boston, Seattle, Charlotte, Boise...) will the ant be completely lost and end up dying alone of starvation (etc.), or will it find the nearest ant nest and become part of that group? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love how they [ended season one:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olh8QvnGLEk)

 Our season ends right there

 With questions everywhere

 Like "Will the princess waste her whole life waiting?"

 "Will Gareth and the queen rule the entire scene?"

 "Will all this singing kill our Nielsen ratings?"

 "Sid. The peasants. The entire crew.

 Will they be back for season two?"

 Who knows?

 But if there are more shows

 Then off our hero goes

 And so the legend grows

 The legend known as Galavant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was a matter of size. From what I gleaned, it would've been walk on, say a few lines, leave.

With Rebels, if he's a major recurring (in about 65-75% of episodes, for example), it might be of a more comfortable scale for him. Plus, he can literally phone it in.

Plus, he did VO for the *Rogue Squadron* games, which, back then, were a "low-level" art form. (Versus today when you can get A-listers to be in them without it being seen as detrimental to their career, e.g. Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Kevin Spacey) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I noticed something with the Force Friday wave and amongst the rumors of upcoming figures (e.g. Hux).
(As a note, I'm talking about the 3.75" figures)

It's missing quite a few big significant players:

* Luke, age 53
* Han, age ~63
* Leia, age 53
* R2
* C-3PO (with red arm)
* Chewie (IIRC)
* Snoke
* Tasu Leech
* Bobbajo [](/s "I mean, who wouldn't want him as a figure?!")
* Maz Kanata
* Maz Kanata's criminal pantheon, as seen in the Empire (magazine) photoshoot
* ~~Teedo~~ and their luggabeast
* Max von Sydow

amongst others.

For a franchise that creates figures for characters that had literally three seconds of screentime in the background of a single shot, they sure are short a whole bunch of characters.

Which makes me think that a second Force Friday is going to happen on December 18. A lot of the directly-related books (Visual Dictionary, Incredible Cross-Sections, TFA novelization...) are due out that day.

Just a thought. </TEXT>

Part of it (set after ANH) would be him having to deal with the realities of him leaving Luke and Biggs to fend for themselves, and perhaps some survivor's guilt over Biggs' death. Perhaps a struggle with "if I had stayed, might Biggs have lived?" And his evolution from generic Rebel pilot to bad-ass Captain Wedge "Gunther" Antilles.

I think they are splitting it over three parts A) to avoid spoilers before TFA and B) because the story that is being told is so important to the following 30 years of galactic history that you'd end up with War   Peace if you tried to put it all in one volume. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My thought is that it's Vidian from *A New Dawn*.

Rae referenced him a number of times in the book. He is a person she could have lied about him being dead, and that the Empire/the galaxy would presume dead.

Another piece of evidence comes from Pg. 365-366.

 This is how it must be. The Empire became this...ugly, inelegant machine. **Crude and inefficient**. We needed to be broken into pieces. **We needed to get rid of those who want to see that old machine churning ineluctably forward. It's time for something better. Something new.**

Vidian was obsessed with making things efficient and "forget[ting] the old ways".

Even though he was blown up (off-screen) in *AND*, he was very much machine, so it's entirely possible he could have survived in space. </TEXT>

[Mild spoilers follow]

And, it also seems like he's paying homage to the Legends continuity. During the committee meeting, the "remnant" debates whether to divide the galaxy with the NR, go to war, start a cold war, etc., all of which the Legends Imperial Remnant did with the NR.

Nice to see the little nods to things in there.

Most sentences in novels are descriptive and action combined.

whereas his are more broken up.

He turned to look at Jenny. His face showed the shock he was in. "What in the name of hell did you do to him?"

I don't mind it.

As soon as I saw that Michael Fassbender was going to be playing an original character in an original story, I got genuinely, enthusiastically excited for it.

Am I still worried it's going to be like pretty much every other VGM and be a piece of crap? Of course.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **The Capital Wasteland has no showers.**

Since 98% of the water in the CW (before Good Karma PP) is irradiated, and any "purified water" is somewhat rare and in small bottles, it's reserved for drinking.

Also, in *none* of the houses I've been to (Megaton, assorted shacks, etc.) do they have showers. Toilets, yes. Sinks, yes. Drinking fountains, sometimes. Showers, no.

This brings me to conclude that pretty much everyone in the Capital Wasteland would have a massive stench. Considering how arid it is after the bombs, that means that the summers get hotter, which means more sweat. And considering everyone gets around on foot, especially caravans, they would all be rancid as fuck.

**No one has made any mention that the Lone Wanderer (and the Courier) have telekinetic abilities**

When you go to pick up an item, you clearly don't use your hands, especially because often there is a gun in them.

And yet, even when you pick up an item in front of someone, they don't freak out. At all. Even though no one else (as far as we know) has telekinetic abilities, they just go on about their business as though it was something everyone had.



Just some thoughts. Take from it what you will. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Anyone else really want to see Jimmy Smits return (even just as a cameo) to play an old Bail?

Since the plans were given to Leia to take, wouldn't it also make sense to have Leia in the movie, as well?

And, perhaps, have Rohan Nichol (in makeup), return to play [Captain Antilles](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Raymus_Antilles)?

I think it would be kind of a neat link, since RO is going to be almost immediately (probably no more than a month; more likely a week or two) before the opening of ANH.

Having Felicity Jones hand off the plans to Bail and Leia, who then confer with Captain Antilles, as the *Tantive IV* prepares to leave Alderaan, perhaps?


I dunno. I just thought it might be a neat way to link RO and ANH. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Potential Spoilers] A thought I had today about Rogue One </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Might Felicity Jones be playing [Ryoo Naberrie](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ryoo_Naberrie)? (Padme's eldest niece)

In Legends, her sister [Pooja] (http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Pooja_Naberrie) becomes Senator for the Naboo region, as well as a Rebel sympathizer. So, it makes sense that her sister might be, too.

Granted, this is all wild speculation, since there is no Legends info on her past Padme's funeral.

Assuming the birthdate of 28BBY, Felicity Jones (31) is about the right age to play Ryoo; she also has the right coloring for it (over Pooja).

	<TEXT> In short, no.

A 1-2 million viewers per ep range is, if I'm not mistaken, about average for cable. If it can hold that (or even increase come S2), it will get a third. And if S3 can hold or increase, a fourth, etc.

For example:

The debut episode [of *Better Call Saul*] set the record for the highest-rated scripted series premiere in basic cable history, with 4.4 million viewers in the 1849 demographic, and 6.9 million viewers overall

Walking Dead gets network-level numbers regularly (low-to-mid 10 millions, on average). Such viewership numbers would all but guarantee renewal on network, let alone cable. For a network, it would have "good" to "quite good" viewership numbers. For cable, it turns AMC into the 13th US Mint.


So, for now, Mr. Robot is safe. Though, I am predicting a Season 2 viewership spike due to word-of-mouth. 

(Also note that the numbers count only same-day watchings. Anyone who watched the show between 1-3 days later is in an expanded category, and anyone who watched it after the three day mark are excluded completely from any number counts, as are On Demand-through-cable viewers.)

	<TEXT> From [Wookieepedia](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Garvin_Dreis):

During the pan-galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars, which broke out in 22 BBY and raged for three years, Dreis served with his homeworld's Rarefied Air Cavalry. When Virujansi was occupied by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Rarefied Air Cavalry fought alongside the Republic Navy to liberate the planet. Much of the air-based combat was fought in the borecrawler caves, where Dreiswho had only just graduated from flying T-16 skyhoppers to Z-95 Headhunterswas given the opportunity to fly alongside the heralded "Hero With No Fear," Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who was leading the Republic air forces in the battle. Dreis was considered to be the hottest pilot on Virujansi despite his youth, until Skywalker arrived. On Skywalker's first trip through the borecrawler caves, Dreis had flown in the lead position, and wondered if the Jedi would be able to keep up. After two minutes, Dreis' musings were answered when Skywalker snap-rolled his Delta-7 and took over the lead. Dreis struggled to keep up, and his astonishment at Skywalker's feat was acknowledged back at base by a smile from the Jedi. Thanks to the efforts of the Rarefied Air Cavalry and the Republic, Virujansi was successfully liberated. In his later life, Dreis would hold Skywalker in great esteem.

Like Domhnall Gleason as General Hux is known by pretty anyone that went to SDCC (so a few several thousands) and it's a non-spoiler spoiler, that is one that gives away information that isn't at all relevant to the story or any gives away any sort of surprise.

Now, if it's leaked/revealed Max von Sydow is playing Phil Skywalker, Shmi's long-lost Force-sensitive brother and Kylo Ren's master, now that would be a genuine (and big) spoiler.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Finally getting around (five years later) to playing and completing Fallout 3. I'm en route towards the end game and had a couple questions about the DLC.

From what I gather *Broken Steel* is a sort of Fallout 3B, a semi-sequel/continuation to the game. Am I way off base?

And, as for *Operation: Anchorage*, *The Pitt*, *Point Lookout* and *Mothership Zeta*, when are they "supposed" to be played? Are they set during the main campaign + *Broken Steel*, or after? (I know it doesn't really matter, I'm just a nut that way)

	<TEXT> What I'd like to see is a Call of Duty-type situation, where Bethesda puts out the numbered installments, which would be set in the east, and Obsidian does the subtitled installments set in the west (perhaps using the Mississippi River as the dividing line, as is geographic convention?).

But instead of annual installments, like CoD, have them come out two or three years apart (depending on the needs of the developer), since they are open-world games and require longer dev time by nature.

Also, having a semi-fixed schedule would allow BGS and Obsidian to plan ahead for stories, to make Fallout 5 and 6 a duology, for example (in a similiar vein of Fallout 1 and 2, if not even more directly than that)

e.g.:

* October 2015 - Fallout 4 (Bethesda)
* between Fall 2017 and Fall 2018 - Fallout: Subtitle (Obsidian)
* between Fall 2019 and Fall 2021 - Fallout 5 (Bethesda)
* between Fall 2021 and Fall 2024 - Fallout: Subtitle (Obsidian)

I'm hot by nature and sometimes even shorts and a t-shirt is too warm. No air flow to anywhere. Dresses allow airflow all the way up. Must be nice.

When you think about it, guys are the ones who should be wearing dresses and skirts, since women's parts as all internal and guys are external and temperature-sensitive (thus why the scrotum tightens and loosens, in case you didn't know), so dress and skirts seem more natural for men to wear and pants for women to wear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> e.g. NCR continues expanding east after taking New Vegas, BoS moves west after taking control of the Capital Wasteland (pending FO4). The line eventually meets in the center of the country, with Texas becoming the front-lines of the inevitable conflict.

Texas is very proud of being Texas. You don't see people in California or Indiana with the shape of the state plastered on front doors and cars and everywhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Texas, NYC or San Francisco.

Texas is probably going to become a major battleground between whichever two factions won in F3 (and depending on how it plays out, F4) and NV. It also has a history of having an independent streak a mile long and an inch deep, which could be used to make for a massive War for Texas between the factions of the Texas Triangle (San Antonio, Dallas, Houston), as well as Far West, like El Paso, and the Panhandle. They could have a massive up-scale in map-size and send you all over Texas on missions.

NYC was hit during the Great War and it would be interesting to see how a major city recovered (or not) over the last 200 years. And you could go all over the city (yes, even Staten Island!).

SF was last seen 100 years ago in Fallout 2. Being a key city for the Enclave, as well as (likely) being a major port city for the NCR, I would think that, since FO2, it would have recovered very nicely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that if Lucas had made the politics of the GR and the CW the B-plot of the PT, they would have come out much stronger.


If you look at the PT from the political angle, it is a great (and scary) story of how one man brought down a government through wholly legal and legitimate means. 

The OT is clear-cut black-and-white/good-vs-bad, whereas the PT was made up of varying shades of grey.

Even the Jedi weren't the beacons of light they were always made out to be in the OT (perhaps the biggest lie of omission to Luke by Obi and Yoda). They had become complacent and, because of the lack of Sith for 1000 years, their collective ego had become grossly inflated. In a way, they were as bad as the Sith ("only a Sith deals in absolutes") because it was either the Jedi way, or no way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indeed.

I think, given the right author (or even recommissioning Zahn himself), Thrawn could easily be worked back in in the 30 Year Void.

Some things would have to change, since it's now an equal-opportunity Empire, but he could still be the lone Chiss in the Empire, for example.


If not Zahn, then I think Christie Golden (who wrote Dark Disciple) could pull off his reintroduction well.

Story Group has said (don't remember where I read it) have said that they are well aware of who fans love/hate/love to hate and may or may not have plans for them.

e.g. Armand Isard's re-introduction (albeit with a massive promotion to head of COMPNOR) into the canon in *Tarkin* may be setting the stage for Ysanne's return. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mad von Sydow's role in TFA </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-15 08:47:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With the Vanity Fair article, the SDCC panel and the trailers, we have had zero news about Max von Sydow, an A-list Oscar-nominated actor.

This leads me to think that:

* he is doing a voice-over of a CGI character and was announced early due to his fame and/or contractual requirements and/or union rules (He's 86, so he may have just recorded his lines in LA, which were sent to the studio for insertion in post-production)

*  he is playing a very major role that is central to the story and are keeping it under wraps because of how important he is to the movie

* he's a returning face from the OT, PT, CW, or Rebels and they want it to be a surprise as to who he is

* he has just a cameo role in the film that is important, but not critical, so they aren't focussing on him

I'd put good credits down on it being 1 (he did VO for Skyrim) or 2.


Thoughts?

Requirements:

The BDP-S3500 has all of that, plus Sony was the creator of Blu-Rays, so they know their shit.

But does anyone else have a better one to recommend? </TEXT>
