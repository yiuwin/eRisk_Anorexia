	<TEXT> "OV1-8 Passive Communication Satallite (PASCOMSAT) Gridsphere To reduce the effects of solar pressure and space drag, the USAF contracted with the Goodyear Aerospace Corp. for construction of a 30-foot diameter grid-sphere balloon. It was made of a soft aluminum wire grid imbedded in a special plastic designed to dissolve in space under the sun's strong ultraviolet rays. On July 13, 1966, the USAF grid-sphere payload was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., atop an Atlas booster. It went into orbit 620 miles above the earth and was automatically inflated with helium. The plastic covering soon dissolved, leaving a 30-foot diameter open aluminum structure orbiting the earth. Tests indicated that the satellite would remain in orbit for at least 11 years and that it had a reflective power five times greater than that of a solid sphere."

	<TEXT> I'd say something weird is happening, but we can't confirm the source(s).

Here are a few confirmed sources of UFOs (IMHO): known/unknown natural phenomena, hoaxes by civilians and militaries (intended to seem like non-human technology), advanced human technologies (secret military aircraft/drones, balloons, satellites), misidentification of prosaic things.

**If** any UFO/UAP is non-human technology (and this has *never* been confirmed), then we have other **theoretical sources**: aliens, time travels, inter-dimensional travelers, earth civilizations from an earlier time (a civilization that developed before an earlier extinction event), etc - but this is ALL just **speculation**. 

Even with some of the most credible cases (ex: JAL 1628), we can say something weird happened, but we can't say it was non-human technology.

Regarding credible witness cases, what evidence do I, as an independent researcher have to corroborate this case? None. 

Credible witness testimony is awesome, but not tangible evidence: astronauts can be wrong/lying/insane/etc.

It seems some formerly credible cases have liars involved (see Jim Penniston's binary code BS). That taints the entire case with a haze of possible hoax.

And that makes you question how many other *credible cases* are BS as well.

There are credible cases, but they seem to be few and far between. And most of them happened decades ago (and even for those there isn't *much* evidence).

Frankly, in this day and age, I'm guessing *most* new UFO cases are drones/photoshop/hoaxes.

So to seriously research this stuff, you may have to go back decades; and even then, the evidence isn't very much to examine.

 And becoming part of ufo communities (similar to this one) is a large part of what turned me off to the idea of ufology.

There are a lot of Believers on this subreddit, but there are also a lot of sane, curious people as well.

 The Phoenix lights: an event where countless people saw a real big fucking object and not just a light. But a solid object moving through the sky.

Lets speculate: this could be a military hoax (lights attached to a giant blimp) or civilian hoax (guys in aerolights spread out). Or aliens/time-travel, etc.

There is no *evidence* for anything other than lights in the sky. Anything more is just speculation.

 Former astronaughts claiming they were watched by aliens in space as they were on space missions. Deathbed confessions.

Could be telling the truth (as they know it). Could be lying, insane, or senile.

No evidence either way.

 Life is weird as fuck man!

Absolutely!

 The school children that saw the alien: some of their stories conflict. But it's still interesting. So do we say that they probably saw something strange? Or do we draw the conclusion that they probably just made it up and we just don't know the "why".

They may have seen something, but we don't know what, and there is no evidence. Maybe they saw a hoax/social experiment, maybe they saw an alien, or maybe they're lying, who knows. No evidence either way.

 Why does there even need to be a motive for making things up anyway? Sometimes people are just nutty.

Agreed.

 So it seems without real tangible and testable evidence, all we can do is go off kind of a faith based system. You either want to believe aliens are visiting us or you don't.

Or you can say weird shit has gone on, and is worthy investigating for the curious. That's why I'm interested in the subject.

 I hate being conflicted. I feel like I'm right in the middle. 

Nothing wrong with that. Be skeptical but keep an open mind. </TEXT>

From what I've read about UFOs near nuclear facilities, they usually seem to be orbs or lights.

It makes me wonder if there is some sort of unknown natural phenomena UAP emitted from (or perhaps attracted to) nuclear materials and facilities.

 His amazon pilot last year was just this awful and seasons 8 and 9 weren't good either.

	<TEXT> As a long time viewer of the show, it was disappointing as well.

But there are 2 types of episodes: 1. Mythos episodes like this one that deal with aliens, and 2. Standalone, Monster of the Week episodes.

Watch the latter ones in the revival, I'm assuming they'll be better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Mulders entire perspective to be thrown away after a short conversation with one woman? Its not even this definitive thing. She already has stated her memories are fuzzy and impossible to know for sure. It seems like Mulder and Scully shift their dispositions 5 times in the episode alone, so its hard to see where anyone stands and where anyone is going.

That was the worst part for me.

 hoping to see more of Skinner and CSM.

Absolutely. Was so nice to see Skinner again. If I was him I would've bitch slapped Mulder though, acting like a teenager when he's 50. </TEXT>

And that Asian scientist (that got blown up) was in a couple of earlier episodes: Firewalker and the one with the Time Traveling assassin at MIT. </TEXT>

Frank has got to be one of the most selfless protagonists on TV. But always to his detriment.

Very sad to see Fritz go. Michael Chernus nailed his role.

I hope piece of shit Meeks and Darrow face justice, if we get another season.

And I hope Frank gets his redemption. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The truth is [creator Sam Shaw] and I and the other writers, we certainly talked a lot about what Season 3 is. We certainly know thematically what Season 3 is, which is the aftermath of what happened to the place, that was the most secret place in the whole world, becoming one of the most exposed places in the world. When all of those secrets get exposed what happens? As well as who are the new enemies? And I think we're setting that up in Season 2, where it's the birth of the Cold War. That's why this show always was never about the end of World War II, but always about the new world order that World War II ushered in, and the birth of the Atomic Age. For us always, these two seasons are Act 1 in a three-act series. By dropping the bomb, now they've opened Pandora's box, and that begins the next chapter of our storytelling."

	<TEXT> It's still a good show, but yes, IMHO it's been boring up until a few episodes ago.

Some of that has to do with the plot lines. Last season we dealt with treachery and terrorism in Pakistan; each episode was riveting.

This season, we deal with a Wikileaks/Snowden type plot initially, then a Russian mole in the CIA, then finally Jihadi terrorism in Europe.

The first two plot lines (Wikileaks/Mole) are interesting, yes, but they don't keep me glued to my seat.

Once we started dealing with terrorism (and Quinn) again, the show became awesome again.

And the Alison/SVR plot has *dragged on*, and it's still going. I'm interested in the plot, but I'm frustrated.

After Season 3, the show stopped being Brody TV, and became an espionage show.

The show is great when it deals with terrorism; it starts firing on all cylinders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So now that Quinn's face is in the public domain, I'm guessing his undercover career is over.

If he makes it to next season, I'm guessing he'll have an analyst or political position. </TEXT>

It just makes me appreciate last season that much more: there was a great mix of action and drama from the first episode. This season, not so much. </TEXT>
