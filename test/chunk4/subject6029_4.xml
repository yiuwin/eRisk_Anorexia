(The phb ranger does not allow large creatures and the [unearthed arcana ranger](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/UA_RevisedRanger.pdf) has a list of creatures that the elk is not a part of). If I bend the rules a little bit and let them do this, will it give them a considerable advantage? I've looked and the elk is weaker than many of the beasts allowed RAW.

	<TITLE> A mind flayer colony for my players. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-28 03:44:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **The mind flayer hive. **
Accessible from the surface world only through the Jotunskye sewers, a mind flayer colony is forever growing and expanding its influence. Taking the proper path through the sewer will lead to a bridge ending halfway over a vast cavern, with the only way to go being down. A floating craft will ascend to the bridge to transport thrills to and from the city. No light from the city ever reaches the top, as the craft will move down thousands of feet before it reaches the bottom and it passes through a thin layer of magical darkness before it reaches the city. Armed thralls await the craft, along with a mind witness connected directly to the elder brain. When the doors to the city are opened, the craft floats downward still, floating past the thrall barracks and to the main chamber. This is where the mind flayers go about their business. Markets filled with artifacts, the mind flayer private chambers and even a gladiatorial arena are present here. Visitors welcome in the city are allowed in this chamber only. 

**Thralls**
Mind flayers, (as many know), consume the brains of creatures for sustenance. Their many thralls, (who outnumber the mind flayers 5:1) need to eat too. This problem is solved by taking the bodies of dead thralls (or living ones if necessary) and placing them in large vats where they will be liquified and fed to the other thralls.  The brains will always be removed first unless it has been damaged severely. The brains will mostly be used as food for the elder brain (more on that below) but sometimes the colony will see other uses for them. (Such as intellect devourers. 


**The inner chamber**
Lower still, is the inner chamber. No one except for certain thralls and high ranking mind flayers are allowed in this sacred place. A different craft will take those allowed down hundreds of feet through total darkness. This chamber holds both the incubation pods and the elder brain. A complex system is in place for feeding the brain bio-material and separating the tadpoles from it,and placing them in their tanks where they will form into new mind flayers over the course of decades.

**Caring for the brain **
The most dexterous thralls will be used to massage the elder brain, and facilitate its feeding and its children. 
To the mind flayers, the elder brain represents their only salvation, their ancestors, and the only hope for their species. They will do everything to protect it. 
Anti magic generators are attached to the sides of the spherical room. 
The elder brain is sensitive enough to pick up the radiation of the weave, this annoys it. Because of this, no arcane magic works in this room. 


**The elder brain**
The brain appears as a mass of grey matter, with veins pulsating and glowing in a myriad of colours. Near the frontal lobe there is a small orifice called the neural siphon. this will lead to the centre of the brain. When a mind flayer dies, it's brain is extracted and lowered into the siphon where it is meticulously dissected by the elder brain. The consciousness of the mind flayer then joins its ancestors in the realm of thought. 
Closer to the back of the brain, the lobes separate and pool of briny liquid sits, about a foot in diameter. This is the dissipation pool. Brains that do not belong to mind flayers (or mind flayers that have been ostracized by the brain) are placed here. The fluids will dissolve the grey matter and the elder brain will continue to thrive. This is the only food that the elder brain can survive on. 


**Incubation **
Below the brain are the incubation tanks. Tubes connected to the elder brain will release tadpoles that that swim down into a  tank of briny liquid. Captured humanoids deemed to be incubators will be paralyzed, taken to the inner chamber and placed into a coffin shaped incubation tank. From there, a kind of oxygen mask will be attached to the subjects face and several needles will pierce into the subject's spine. Detaching the nerves that allow motor control and rendering them completely paralyzed. The needles will then lock into the spine. If the subject is pulled from the tank, their spine will be ripped apart. Thin tubes will pierce through a few of the subjects arteries and food will be introduced to the body intravenously. The tank will then fill with briny liquid, and glass will be placed over the top. When the elder brain releases a tadpole deemed fit for survival, it will be transported to an incubation tank and released. The larva will burrow into the subjects chest and begin feeding. The entrance hole will heal quickly in the briny solution. Because the incubators food enters and exits the body through intravenous tubes, there are many organs that the subject no longer needs. The tadpole will consume all of these over the course of a couple weeks. Although the incubator cannot control its body, it still feels everything, and this is extremely painful. Eventually, the tadpole will swim up to the target's brain and begin eating. The cerebral cortex of the incubator will be eaten and replaced by the larva. 
This is when the larva begins to develop psionic power. A connection between it and the elder brain is formed. The mind flayer's mind will mature as hormones are produced that slowly turn the body of the incubator into a mind flayer. The larva will grow, slowly consuming the rest of the target's brain. The subject will understand this is happening, as the larva will be able to telepathically communicate with them the entire time. They will feel all their thoughts, feelings, and memories slowly be consumed by the mind flayer, until there is nothing left. When the larva has completed it's decade long transformation into a mind flayer, the incubation tank will drain, the needles placed in it's spine will unhook, and the glass lid of the tank will be opened. The newly formed mind flayer will step out and ascend out of the inner chamber, past the elder brain and it's younger siblings. It will then join the rest of its kind in the main chamber. 


P.s. Part of this is based on the answers to question I posted here a couple days ago. Thanks for all your help gals and guys! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am creating a mind flayer hive for an upcoming campaign and I want to have the mind flayer incubation tanks play a prominent part in the adventure. How could the mind flayers efficiently paralyze a large amount of humanoids so that their tadpoles can grow? I'm basing this off the tarantula hawk, a wasp that will paralyze tarantulas and lay it's eggs inside it. 

It's important that the incubators understand what is happening to them. 

Ps. My mind flayers are aliens that crashed on this world long ago, so they have some advanced technology. </TEXT>
