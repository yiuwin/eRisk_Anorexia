He's obviously a talented developer, so why not make your own game with your own art and ideas, why put all this time and effort into something that obviously breaks so many content laws and is bound to be demolished by Nintendo.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I'm looking for a list of exchanges which trade doge directly to USD. I'm setting up dogegraph.com to record and display data of actual doge-usd since I think that should be our real goal instead of getting excited everytime bitcoin goes down and we think doge is going up..

What I'm looking for is 3-4 of the bigger usd exchanges to query for data. I'm a programmer so have no problem getting the actual data from the sites, I'm just looking for people thoughts on which exchanges the site should monitor :0

Any suggestions is appreciated </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Truth is I don't know :) But here's my logic.

-Huge exposure around the world in the past 2 days.
-Block halving in few weeks
-lots of people sad they didn't get in on bitcoin groundfloor are seeing doge rise and gain traction

We are trading such volume at this current price there's not going to be that many 'cheap' dogecoin available (doge mined early or bought alot cheaper) so I would predict most people don't want to take a loss, so they will fix their sell price to this new peg.

Who knows though, not me.

I really have no idea, </TEXT>

Yes we can provide a system to verify the shuffle. We store all that information at the moment so at the end of each hand we could make it available to the player.

What we need is a way to step backwards through the shuffle to prove it followed the hash however, with little development time available and alot more features planned however it's not a top priority to get this live just yet. It will get done eventually though :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to find the .dogecoin directory (sorry not sure on mac, on unix it's in the users root folder) and delete blk0001.dat, blkindex.dat and the database folder (I THINK).

This will redownload the blockchain, and after 30-40 mins depending on your connection everything should be back to normal :)

source: I had to do this yesterday

BEWARE: there will also be a wallet.dat in that folder, that is your wallet. Deleting that will delete all your dogecoin, back it up before making any changes even closely related to dogecoin :) </TEXT>

If we were going to scam people we wouldn't have gone to the effort of actually programming the games. And ripping people off tends to be bad for business and building repeat players :) We're here for the long haul and are working on some new games over these next few weeks.

I hope you decide to give gambledoge.com a shot :)

	<TEXT> Hi guys,

http://GambleDoge.com

We've just added video poker to our lineup of DogeCoin games. I've made all these games myself and would love to hear some feedback form real players.

If you want to post your GambleDoge.com username here, I'll send you some doges on the site to get started :)

Thanks!


EDIT: Thanks guys I must go now, please leave all your feedback in the comments I really look forward to reading it. We've given out a few thousand doges tonight :) TO THE MOON </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys,

I posted over the weekend with our first game (10x or nothing) being live. I've just now put live our first slot machine. It's quite simple at the moment but before I expand it I'd really appreciate people taking some time to test it.

I'm very much open to suggestions for tweaks, new games etc and really want to hear your feedback. Check it out, post here or PM me.

To the moon shibes! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I've been working on a doge casino today and have the first game (albeit simple game) working.

If you've got a moment, and are interested in wagering a few doges please head over to http://www.gambledoge.com (use http://89.32.148.203 if the domain isn't resolving yet, it's new!)  and register to play :).

You send doges to an address and gamble directly from the address, I am yet to push live the withdraw code, but will have that automated within the next few hours.

I'm a programmer, not a designer. There is absolutely no styling on the site. I hope that doesn't put you off too much...If you're a designer, feel free to give me a psd of something pretty and I'll turn it into html :p

Please PM me or post here if you have any issues or suggestions!!!
