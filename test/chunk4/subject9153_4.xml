	<TEXT> I was thinking about this as well

Since LR Goku will be kinda game breaking, his best booster should get some honorable mention

Kinda like TEQ Cell and SSB Goku.

Both TEQ and PHY Bardock have reasonable advantages.

I'd add that PHY Bardock acts as a shield since he can take the INT hits that would kill LR Goku (he's strong enough to warrant using him even with type disadvantage) </TEXT>

Indeed, some 16 years old already have adult bodies so BEING ATTRACTED TO THEM IS NORMAL. Acting on it? Not so much.

But if you show me, uh, I don't know, a pic Taylor Swift I will want to fuck her brains out. If now you tell me she's 16 but looks like an adult, why wouldn't I still be attracted?

	<TEXT> Can they be denounced or something?

I'm sure some psychologist or something should be able to identify how toxic this is

When I was a child I would have felt like shit if suddenly my teachers started talking about how much innate power I have over my black classmates.

And that would probably made said blacks feel worse, too. 

It just creates an uncomfortable situation instead of letting those kids grow up and be normal. It's not like we're teach to beat blacks, some people fear them by experience and some never had any problem with them.

Don't put any weird ideas on those poor kids  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tell me a good reason the States can't just bomb the fuck outta Palestine and end it once and for all.

It's clear they are the villains in this story, and they will never stop. Even their president is rotten to the core with that Hamas ideology, his right hand or something even said "if you see someone from Israeli slit his throat"

So, why are well-armed countries expected to just watch? I'm sure if they just ganged up on it, they could destroy it before they retaliate.

Then each country just look at each other, nod, and never talk about it again. 

If Germany suddenly said something so outrageous about wanting to kill people from other countries, say, France, I believe every country would give them a warning. Why does Palestine have special treatment? </TEXT>

If they actually knew anything, it's not like you are forced to watch this. I haven't heard of anyone refusing to watch movies because Michael Bay movies exist. 

This is just another part of the whole anime thing, you choose to watch it or search for something else.


Also, cartoon chicks are nice. Every person I've know has been attracted to some sexy anime/cartoon character, it's only natural to still consider them attractive if you still watch it.

	<TEXT> Honest, I'm asking honestly, why isn't islam just banned?

Why are they clinging to some set of beliefs if they already saw what it causes?

Best thing they can do is STOP TEACHING IT to new generations. They need to separate themselves officially from that. You even said that less than 100 years ago they weren't that deep into religion.

In the past people just banned what they deemed dangerous, like science. But there's a clear difference, Islam is doing no progression except for mass murder. Only problem if Islam is forbidden is that current practicers will mentally struggle for a year or so, then live their lives. 

It wouldn't be the first time humanity does something like that, it's been proved that it's effective. Lots of knowledge have been lost throughout history, this could be another instance of it.

Not that I hate islam or muslims, just the stuff it causes. Something has to be done and I'm not sure if the government is even thinking about a long-term solution. </TEXT>

But then I remember, a woman's word is everything that matters in those cases. You may or not may rape her, once she talks it's all the same. 

I don't see it happening with other crimes like murder or theft, you can't just go into the police station and claim Billy killed Jimmy to get them insta-jailed just with good acting. Hell, some people even get their houses occupied by strangers and they have to go through a lot just to get them out because the police doesn't believe they are the rightful owners. </TEXT>

It's more against people who self-diagnose themselves with it just because they overreact to things. Like, there was some reporter claiming he got PTSD from firing a rifle in a practice. That's how light that shit's used nowadays. He was just being a sissy, a cupcake, he could have been said he was upset, but no, gotta make some drama.

And almost everyone (SRS) getting mad at "offensive" comments are like that. The "Triggered" is meant to give em' a lil' slap.

It's up there in the Hall of Shame with people claiming depression because they didn't get an A+ on their test or idiot girls saying they're Bipolar because they have a normal range of emotions.

	<TEXT> Alright, I've got too much bottled up hate, I never really had this problem before but this is too much. First a little bit of background about who I am. Skip to the next half of the thread if you wanna get to the point right now.

I'm Bisexual, but I've never had a problem with it. I grew in a low income family and went to medium class over the years so I could afford all levels of education; currently in College. 

That means I've met a bunch of people like most of you do, I wasn't secluded on some mountain. I always liked girls since I was 5 years old but only at 13 I had attraction for a male friend for the first time.

But at that age we made jokes about gays so it wasn't obviously going anywhere, and I didn't actually care that much since I also liked some girls. I'm not talking about love, it's just that I was like "hmm, he/she's pretty" 

And that's it. Since then I can totally see some dude and think he's hot, I would bang him, but just like you don't fall in love with everyone, I've only ended up dating some girls by chance. Not many mind you, I'm your average redditor who is mostly on the internet or playing videogames. Sexual orientation doesn't really do much. I've told some close friends on college but only as a novelty, I said I was more into girls and didn't really like them, we laughed about it and we never talked about it again.

What do you get from this story? I am Bisexual, but it doesn't define who I am. Sexuality shouldn't be your identity. I still have a functioning brain and my actions aren't decided by my "sexual identity". 

Of course, it'd be for the better if I could freely talk with everyone about being Bisexual without raising any brows. I'm a pretty normal person, I use the F-word and some slurs and don't get offended by "anti-LGBT" trolls because I KNOW I am normal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And that's where the problem starts. I'm all for Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals acceptance. They are mostly accepted by the society right now, we're constantly showing that WHICH PEOPLE YOU DECIDE TO LOVE DOESN'T CHANGE WHO YOU ARE. 

Getting my point by now? We're gaining the RIGHT to be part of the mainstream culture. Well, I already consider myself part of it, advantages of being Bi, but there are people out there who still feel oppressed. 

Since the Orlando shooting happened, it was the best time to show the world that homosexuals and bisexuals are the same as you and I. We're no different. For all you know, Superman might be banging Batman while we don't watch, because sexuality has nothing to do with who we are. It's about loving someone.

With the years we're always represented as sexual, flamboyant deviants who are only sex driven or have weird mannerisms but that was wearing down with time. Here it is, Youtube will release a video, it will surely be a big hit and open some eyes.

And man, it DID open some eyes. Wide. In shock. I never cared that much about being Bi but I was happy that everything was going places, then I watch the video and see how they lumped us together with... I don't even think transexuals is the right word. Some kind of queers I believe talking about omnisexuality, being agender, some thing which didn't even said what it was and looked like an alien (probably by choice, that's the bad part) and some other gross stuff.

By now you're probably outraged but so am I, that was the last straw. I was always like "homosexuals are fine, they could be a part of society and you wouldn't know because it doesn't mean they become monsters or something, they don't stick out"

AND YOUTUBE JUST TURNS 180 DEGREES! To drag down the whole community and tell people "look at this rogues gallery, lovable aren't they?" as if they were fucking mocking us.

No, please, no. People thinking homosexuals are flamboyants was a bad enough stereotype, not even I like them so I get why someone would get grossed out by them. BUT YOUTUBE GOES AND SHOWS SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT

That's not a right message, people already had a hard time with homosexuality and instead of saying "Your sexual orientation doesn't make you weird" they just go and show people with sexualities no normal people has ever heard of AND people who totally mutated their bodies. 

Be assured we LGB aren't anything like that. It was the last straw. Now I fully believe that instead of adding more letters to "LGB", they should just separate and form a whole new acronym with the rest of Queers. We were close to being mainstream and that sent us directly to the abyss so hard Youtube had to deactivate comments.

It doesn't matter if Trans were once avid fighters for our rights, thing is, LGB is practially mainstream and they are dragging us down HARD. 

Right now, Trans on the LGB is the same as People of Colour on the LGB. Sure, both want to fight for their rights, but they are different battles. 

LGB is about being normal even tho you have a different taste for your partners, T is not a sexual orientation at all. They are asking a totally different kind of acceptance; a physical one with an image who doesn't fit the standards of society. 

Now a lot of people and me just feel like we'll need to wait some more years to freely talk about who we like because Youtube grossed out the public showing people and putting us ALL under the same banner, "LGBT", while it's inaccurate. For god's sake, on that video were things that would scare children, that's not a good image to have you know!?!?

We're not partners on the same community anymore. 3 letters are fighting to be accepted for who they love and be able to lead an average life, while you fight for your "identity" and it gets really blurry what falls under that definition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because of the HUGE miss representation the poor community got.

LGB try to convince society that they are normal people and can easily integrate, and then youtube goes showing some kind of vampire and a man saying he's pregnant "Here, these are members of the LGBT community, like the ones killed on the Orlando shooting. Love them" 

That doesn't reflect reality at all. LGB people are like you and me, they only happen to like their same gender or both of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I said that jokingly but my stance is actually well thought out.

People say that you should invert the genders but they fail to realize, Men and Women are very different. He's a champ and his life would have been better had his mother not come across the phone.

Remember a common trope about kids stealing porn magazines and talking about boobs with their friends? It's real. 

Male kids are not oblivious to this stuff. The whole purpose of laws is to protect them from rape but there are rare instances like this where there was no possible harm. Not physical nor mental. Just win.

And yes, some kids already beat their dongs at that age and would rather a hottie like that.
