	<TEXT> I do think every comedian can go a little too far. "Oh, my last joke was funny? Let's add on even more edginess because thatll make it even funnier !!"

in general, however, iIfeel like he is pretty aware of showing he doesn't mean what he says. Under some circumstances that doesn't matter, but it's kinda "I know I'm a bad person for saying this but..."

I guess I can't completely explain it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really love the characters, but can't get into the plot. To me, it's getting to be a lot of reading through repetitive chatlogs are overcomplicated exposition. So I have a question or two:

Considering this, should ai continue reading? I'd like to get more dharacters, or develop old ones more. Am I remotely close to being up in speed (probably not)?

Yeah, I have diagnosed with an eating disorder, depression, secondary amenorrhea, osteopenia, anxiety, and am being tested for Aspergers. I still treat people with the respect they all deserve. Having mental or physical difficulties doesn't mean a free pass to be as nasty as you want.
