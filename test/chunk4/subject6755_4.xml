	<TEXT> This. OP, you have to understand that sampling isn`t "copying" and "slightly changing" sounds. It`s about reusing music for a new purpose that would not have been imaginable or applicable before. Having tried sampling myself, I have so much respect for Daft Punk`s ability to make such amazing music with only bits and pieces of other tracks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I 100% agree with you. I admire Kanye's work not because of his personality, but because of how well he transfers his personality into his music. There are few artists out there, obviously including Daft Punk, that have the talent and musical insight into expressing emotions so naturally. Kanye exudes a great understanding of the angry, egoistic quality that humans possess, and his music shows it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remember, this is exactly what Daft Punk wants. Low media attention yet still having a strong fan base. Also, don't forget all the media attention Justin and One Direction have "milked" (movies, street racing, etc). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I were to assume this is real, I love the duality Nintendo is making here with Majora's Mask. Majora's Mask revolves around the moon destroying the Earth and Link's endeavor to restore balance. This game, inferring from the title, will protect a dying sun. Also, the title better translates to "The Protector of The Aero Sun." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I saw the three words and thought of song names with three words in them. Comparing the words and song names, I saw there wasn't any strong correlation, so I looked at the letters themselves and realized "hey, that kinda spells out...." so I tested my hypothesis and turns it spells out "Technologic."  </TEXT>
