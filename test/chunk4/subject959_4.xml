	<TEXT> [Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst -- Kendrick Lamar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WQV_cULobA)

In reality a lot of his songs have done this for me I only chose this one because it's probably my favorite song of his and it's one of the first moments I can remember listening to a song and feeling actual chills down my spine. If there's a song out there I think is perfect this is it </TEXT>
