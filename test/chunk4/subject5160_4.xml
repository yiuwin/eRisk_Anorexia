	<TEXT> Skullknight warned Guts that what he wants may not be what Casca wants. Its clear that Guts is still in love with Casca and wants her sanity restored so he can be with her again. But if Casca remembers the Guts's assault on her, it may very well be a key factor in her rejecting him once she's sane again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think your right in that it was a screw up, because the Holy Chain Iron Knights question how Serpico got the position in the knights that he has, yet in another scene refer to him as her flunky brother. Its a direct contradiction, if they knew he was her brother than they would assume thats why he has the job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While i'm not aware of any nuclear weapons based infrastructure projects in the United States, there have in the past been various projects related to medical research and psyops testing that were conducted on various civilian populations by the American government. In particular, MKUltra comes to mind, where the US Government tested mind control and psyops techniques on unwitting subjects in the populace, giving unsuspecting individuals LSD and other drugs in experiments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [The Soviets actually did enact a program like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Explosions_for_the_National_Economy), they used nuclear blasts to shut down out of control oil and gas well fires, geological sounding research, and excavating natural gas storage chambers. These blasts went on until 1988, and there are advocates in Russia to restart the program, largely for the purpose of putting out uncontrolable oil and gas well fires that no other means have been able to put out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone about a year ago posted story-board type threads with shots from other movies that proved its possible to film at the very least the  Golden Age parts of the story. The black swordsman arc is probably filmable as well. Anything beyond that would likely require a massive budget due to the large amounts of CGI needed. It would not surprise me at all if Netflix actually went forward with a live action adaptation of Berserk, given that they have already shown an interest in other live action anime adaptations and that they have shown an interest in Berserk in general by streaming the Berserk films on their site. </TEXT>
