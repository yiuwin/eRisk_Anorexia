But the themes behind this post (themes like me wanting to die, me joking about it in texting slang, me really wanting to fucking kill myself) are so fucking true you don't even understand. 

Why am I like this!!!!!???? Why won't it end!!!!???? Why won't Rachel MdAdams let me have sex with her????!!!!! I've seen everything she's been in except Everything Will Be Fine, and the tv shows she's cameoed in!!!!! 

Plz help lmao!

Why did /u/subject6620 kill himself?

~~To end its miserable life of depression and anxiety~~

Because despite living a pretty damn good and privileged life in a first world country he still felt empty inside and became so depressed he decided to end it on August 15th 2016. 

If I survive I can always say I was just doing it ironically so it's cool!

	<TEXT> I've been watching it. It's pretty good. The main actress is great and so is Keith David. The teenage daughter seems more realistic than most teenagers in shows.

The only major problem is that it seems a little slow and sometimes really boring. It's taking 13 episodes to tell a 10 episode story. 

One of the best parts about this show is the setting. I've never seen a show set in a megachurch before. The interesting setting makes it a little more than just another family drama.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm about to watch it because the trailer looked cool and it has some good reviews so far but a 93 minute first episode is kinda off-putting. If the shows good then it shouldn't matter but 93 minutes feels like a long time. 

I've never liked movie-length episodes. TV is great because it's in short(ish) bursts.

Edit: It's funny that Jaden Smith's character says stuff like "Constellations tell a story." And everyone calls him a weirdo.
