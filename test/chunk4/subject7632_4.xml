	<TEXT> Fair enough :)

I actually don't remember most of the shiny colours anyway. I have to double check most of the time to make sure.

But I do hope Shinies are a thing. It's another piece of gameplay that will keep me going :)

However, I really don't want it to be an "ONLY WHEN YOU CATCH IT" thing. It should at least show that colour in the capture arena, if not the overworld map </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As u/ntnl said, you're missing the point. Most of the game is based on random occurrences. If there IS a Pokmon near me, I don't care whether it's a Pidgey or a Dragonite. I want to know what's near me. I'm not asking to be given GPS co-ordinates, but they already got us used to using the nearby tab to check what was nearby. Taking that away (in my opinion) is a complete fail in progressing the gameplay. It's literally taking a step backwards with regards to the tracker. I don't understand why they can't just make it work with both Nearby AND Sightings or at the very least, have a total of 9 in the combination of both.
Most of the time, I have 5 "Nearby" spots filled at a Pokstop that is barely on my map and because of that, I cannot see what is near me and I just have to actually check every half an hour or so. </TEXT>

But, while the Omanyte looks like the shiny, the Staryu doesn't fit the actual sprite here:

It should be more light grey than dark green. And the middle gem should be blue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happens to me about once a day and it ALWAYS happens when I'm not looking at my phone.

So basically, I check my phone, swipe a stop or something, then continue to do something else and when I look back, it's on my home screen. I've never actually noted why or how this happens.

It might be important to note that I've never seen it say "Pokmon Go has stopped" - which indicates that it might be CLOSING. Not CRASHING. Just a thought. Maybe I'm totally wrong. </TEXT>

Suicune fits in with Mystic's theme.

Entei fits in with Valor's theme.

And Raikou fits in with Instinct's theme.

Perhaps even a new team leader for each team.

I actively searched for it every day for the week it was announced and I only found one the week after that. Still haven't seen another one even though I catch every Pidgey, Zubat, Rattata and Magikarp I find.

TL;DR to me, it's rare. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had the error yesterday. It kicked me out mid-battle and I couldn't battle for a while. I tried a few times, then gave up, bought groceries at the shop next to the gym for about 10 minutes and then tried again and it worked. Unfortunately, I don't know how long the delay/soft ban was except that it must have been 10 minutes or less.

I was training a Mystic gym. Not battling a rival gym.

Also, I noted that my attacker kept its battle damage after I got kicked out. Not sure if this was always the case.

But I'm relatively sure that the prestige went up for my one battle as well. I guess the one battle saved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When a Mummy from Niantic and a Daddy from Niantic love each other very much, they make a baby application named Pokmon Go.

But Mummy and Daddy need money from Pokmon Go because they are using money to make it.

So that's why they want to make lots of fun characters for everyone to spend money on.

Now, there's lots of people who want to know what Mummy Niantic and Daddy Niantic want to do, so they look at Pokmon Go while the Niantics aren't watching. They examine everything they can and they find out lots of things. Then they show everyone these things to get lots of internetz. Everybody is very happy and we all know what's going to be in the app!

The end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. u/FlashFlyingTrample might be doing something "magical" but it's ruining the entire point of playing a game.

This is just my personal opinion, but the game isn't about just having everything. It's about playing to get there.

I feel like this is the gaming equivalent to buying a driver's license. Sure you have the end result, but you have no idea what is normally supposed to go into getting that and you don't understand or appreciate it at the end. </TEXT>

It really could be the Gen 2 thing. However, as I said, let's not assume anything until Niantic gives us more info. </TEXT>

I think it's a legitimate question.

 It may have something to do with Niantic being a US-based company.

Hopefully this will work like the Nearby tracker where they got something working in their area and then expanded on it.

Maybe we'll get Starbucks stuff a little later. I have no doubt that if Starbucks made extra profit with the American event, they'll want to roll it out even further. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jokes aside, the reason your idea won't work well is because many Gen 2 Pokmon are linked to Gen 1. How would you get a Crobat in Johto if it didn't link to Zubat and Golbat in Kanto?

Unless you're suggesting that the entire 251 Pokmon would be in Johto, but then there's no reason to separate the two.

The only other alternative I imagine would be to only have linked Gen 1 Pokmon (Zubat, Poliwag, Slowpoke, etc) in Johto. </TEXT>

As far back as I can remember, people have been saying their relative works at Pokmon and that's why they know what's going to happen / have all the stuff / get things for free.

This applies to pretty much any community though. People did this for Dragonball Z, etc too.

Anyway, this was almost always nonsense and it became a running joke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  it just takes away freedom of choice.

How does it take away freedom of choice?

Right now, if you're Mystic and you find a Level 10 Mystic gym, you can't do anything about it. THAT's taking away your choice or stopping you from playing at this gym. My suggestion is to promote diversification.

 what if you went to go join a gym and you have to choose between placing him and only getting 2 coins, or placing something much weaker that would get you more coins but could easily be kicked out because it's the lowest on the CP stack?

Remember that it's not just level 30 players in this game. There's level 5 players who don't get to use gyms at all because there's 10 level 30 Dragonites in them all the time.
At the very least, if there was a Pidgeot, maybe the low level guy could take it down with his/her 6 best Pokmon.

 now we have to make a choice between coins and strength/longevity/CP stack placement (even the opportunity to be a gym king) simply because we didn't get there soon enough?

All the gyms I see now are either Level 2 gyms with absolute crap in them because someone rushed to put something in and collect coins... or it's a Level 10 gym with ONLY Dragonites, Vaporeons, Rhydons, etc. If you're a level 5 player, you put your highest CP Pokmon in there anyway and that's probably 500 CP but you get to put something in. If it's 50 CP, is that going to make a massive difference to the next person attacking it with 6 of their 3000 CP Dragonites?

This was part of my thought behind this:

I saw a Kabutops in a gym recently. This was so awesome to me because I never saw a Kabutops yet. I've noticed that this specific trainer always takes down gyms and puts in something less common in our area as a gym defender. He/she also put in a Jynx a while ago and a Ditto before that. I have some new 'dex entries because of this dude and I was pretty excited about it.

I'd love gyms to have less common Pokmon on a regular basis.

Wouldn't you like to fight an Omastar or a Rapidash sometimes instead of the same few Pokmon every time?

Besides, there's enough top gym defenders to still allow a full gym of decent Pokmon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. But I also want u/epracer71 's idea to have some effect on the gyms because I'm also tired of seeing 6 Dragonites and 4 Vaporeons in a level 10 gym.

I think you should be able to place the same Pokmon, but at a reduced-income.

If the gym is brand new and Person1 adds a Dragonite, they get to claim 10 coins for that gym. Person2 also adds a Dragonite and gets to claim 5 coins from that gym. Person3 also adds a Dragonite and gets to claim 2 coins from that gym. Each next person adding a Dragonite gets to claim 1 coin from that gym.

This won't prevent people from adding Pokmon to gyms but will definitely decrease people from spamming the same Pokmon. </TEXT>
