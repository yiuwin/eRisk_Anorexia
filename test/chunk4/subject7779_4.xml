	<TEXT> Well the upcoming Pokemon Sun/Pokemon Moon will make it around 800+ I think. Been a fan since the 90s and yes, I do agree the Original 151 is awesome and still close to my heart. Though Electivire from Gen ~~5~~ 4 is still my favorite.

EDIT: Gah! I got mixed up with the gens! I have failed you fellow Pokemon fans. My apologies.

	<TEXT>  Don't talk like you have a better alternative.

Well better alternative is buy a Nintendo 3DS/2DS and a copy of Pokemon X/Pokemon Y or Pokemon Omega Ruby/Pokemon Alpha Sapphire or even wait for November 2016 for Pokemon Sun/Pokemon Moon.

EDIT: Add to that, there are plenty of weekly Nintendo 3DS/2DS Streetpass meet ups around the Metro and play Pokemon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Plenty of possible reasons I suppose but most reasons is that they finished the game and would want to move on.

A brand new original game usually costs less than 3k so the resale value to second hand buyers is a good way to buy the games at a lower price. At the same time, the original owners now have additional fund to buy a new game and they will just add money from savings/payroll to purchase the game.

When I sold my game I always say to myself.. 

*"Let other people enjoy the game you finished playing."* :) </TEXT>

Though I have no plans downloading the app, I am in content playing Pokemon in my Nintendo 3DS/2DS and I've been going to weekly meetups to a small Pokemon community in our town. By the time of the release of Pokemon Sun/Pokemon Moon, sure enough it'll be bigger.

	<TEXT> The "XL" you see is only a size variation. The latest console is still Nintendo 3DS but with upgraded hardware which is called "New Nintendo 3DS" that also has an XL variant. Nintendo won't be letting go of 3DS since it is highly successful. As I know, one unit of New 3DS XL costs LESS than 13k. But if you want a budget friendly one you can still purchase regular 3DS XL and there is even a more budget friendly, 2DS which costs LESS than 7k. 2DS doesn't have 3D features and 3D isn't that big of a deal but it does enhance your gaming experience.

Nintendo is currently focused on their incoming gaming console that is still code named NX.

EDIT: The one i'm using is 2DS. I'm still thinking of upgrading to New 3DS. BTW, the games will work on both old 3DS/2DS and New 3DS but there are only games exclusive to New 3DS like Xenoblade Chronicles for New 3DS. </TEXT>

You should start with Symphonia Chronicles if you are into the very traditional Tales because Graces F uses CC similar to Tales of Destiny (PS2). I didn't had the chance playing Tales of Xilia and Xilia 2 but as far as I watched videos on the net, I feel like its a hybrid of Traditional and CC. </TEXT>

Also, the very last jRPG that I played was Tales of Graces F. Then my PS3 went YLoD. I'm still going to buy Star Ocean 5 and a PS4 that I saved 16 months ago! Reviews won't stop me now. I need my jRPG fix!

I plan to change the whole set pa naman next year. Well mukang four wheels na lang bibili ko. Magiging spare yung binili ko ngayon pag bili ko ng new set.

If you're Pocket Wifi is Huawei, like the one from Globe, the app [Huawei HiLink](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huawei.mw hl=en) (both available in App Store and Google Play Store) will feel like your phone has dual sim except your pocket wifi number won't be able to make and take calls.

Better option for you, may nabibili na open line Pocket Wifi at least you're flexible to what mobile carrier to choose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For my Pocket Wifi, I use it when I'm only out of the house or office. Tumatagal yung battery for two and a half days because I power it off when I know there is wifi or I'm not using it.

My phone is Sony Xperia C5 Ultra. One full cycle charge from 100% to less than 25% takes less than 40 hours. I use my phone for: 

* Call
* SMS
* Telegram
* Viber
* Twitter ^([when I'm bored or I want to Tweet something])
* Instagram ^([again if I'm bored or want to post something])
* Reddit is Fun ^([do I have to type it again why? LOL!])
* Waze ^([only using it if I wanna know that my prefered route is traffic])

I only use m.facebook.com because the FB + Messeger App itself really drains battery even if you're not using it. Lastly, for YouTube depends because I know it also sucks out data and battery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, I have a pocket wifi that handles my Data. So I spend another for GoSurf299 that has 1.5GB consumable net with Spotify Premium that also has 1GB consumable Spotify streaming for 30 days. Add the free FB and Free Viber too. All in all I have 1.7GB consumable net. I also schedule it so it won't be that heavy in one payday. I pay 300php for the myStarter Plan every 30th or 31st payday then I pay my mobile internet every 15th of the month.

The reason why I have a pocket wifi is because I want my phone battery to focus on the phone itself since mobile internet really sucks battery life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally enjoyed the movie but I feel like there are characters that felt somehow underused. The Easter Eggs also made me giggle. **In my Opinion**, I still like Days of Future Past more compared to Apocalypse.

If you have questions, feel free to ask. I won't spoil you too unless you want to   I'll PM it you.

EDIT: I'm from South East Asia by the way so I may be asleep when you read this. I'll reply as soon as I wake up. </TEXT>
