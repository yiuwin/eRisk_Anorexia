	<TEXT> but even electrons in other orbitals will still experience an attractive nuclear force wouldn't they? Sure they experience more shielding as the orbitals increase, but if i remember correctly it is after a certain element that shielding outways the effective nuclear charge.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [CHECK MY ANSWER] Using Uncertainty Principle to explain why Wave Mechanical Model should be used over Bohr Model </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-15 07:04:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As a particle electrons must have precise position but as a wave, due to wave properties, moving electron spread over region of space. Thus the position of electron cannot be precisely defined. Due to relationship between momentum and position, if the location of electron can be precisely determined, its momentum cannot and vise versa. As a result of this uncertainty, it is more appropriate to talk about finding probabilities of finding electrons of specific energies in a particular orbit. The wave function gives the probability of where an electron will be in a certain region at any time. A Regions of high probability have high electron density maps called orbitals. The 4 quantum numbers can be applied in determining the electron's general location. 

Thank you, i can understand the structure is a bit off...
