	<TEXT> Oh man, kinda late and I'm typing this on a cell phone but I have to tell this story.

Freshman year of high school a friend of mine had a very large iguana. Had to be nearing 10 years old. They took it outside in the front yard to play around with it and ended up tossing the iguana to each other back and forth. They soon started widening the distance between them as they are throwing this iguana to each other. Pretty soon it turned into a competition of who could throw the iguana in the air the highest. After this, I'm assuming the iguana is dead by now, they begin tossing it in front if cars driving by in hopes that one runs the iguana over. After several tries they end up getting the iguana right under a passing car's tires and couldn't stop telling me about the image of the iguana's eyeballs exploding out of it's head. Truly fucked up story. Some real sociopathic shit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my college town it was one of the big party nights where they bring in a a van downtown cause there is so many arrests. Anyways... my friend who was arrested informed me that one of them got arrested without being searched and he had about 20 molly pills on him. He didn't want to get caught with them so everyone took them while in the back of the patty wagon. He said it was the best night you could of ever had in the drunk tank.  </TEXT>
