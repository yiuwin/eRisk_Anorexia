	<TEXT> I have two issues with the kinds of montages. First of all the video quality. You need at least 720p for it to be remotely worth watching in my opinion. So many videos are out there of premiership games and you can barely see a thing. Next is the pacing of the video. Apart from trying to time the big hits to the drops there is not much else done with the music. Might seem me being a bit petty but that's how I feel about a lot of these channels. BsporTV and the like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. I think in the heat of the moment and passion of the day the NZ fans were confused as to what happened and can only have thought that O'Driscoll must have landed awkwardly until well after the event when they properly saw the highlights.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Haka itself adds so much to rugby in my opinion. It is world famous around the world and it is in its right iconic. Teams facing NZ know they are going to have to face it. If anything it should get them pumped. Having said that I would probably be pissing myself if I was facing an All Black doing the Haka. </TEXT>
