	<TEXT> Prosecuting dead people is the very definition of wasting resources. The DOJ already gets stretched thin going after living criminals, no point in having them (or worse, a whole separate agency) going after people who by definition can't be brought to justice, just because it makes some people feel good. Historians can clear up the record without needing a government stamp of approval or government resources too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a bad thing because it is a waste of resources. Other than potentially going after this woman for perjury, which would be difficult if not impossible, there is no judicial route to seek justice for Emmet Till left. Everyone else involved is dead, so this would just take away resources from cases with potential real outcomes such as convictions or acquittals of living people. </TEXT>

You can't send a dead body to jail and there is no lack of actual living criminals that deserve their day in court and a proper prosecution. You're forgetting, or willfully ignoring, the fact that even the DOJ doesn't have limitless manpower, time, and resources. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See the note at the bottom of the page. The author took some pictures themselves, but the restaurant forced them to use press photos, rather than allowing them to photograph the dish themselves (after the review was written, TIL that's a thing) to get more honest photos.

Some readers may notice a difference between my description of the onion dish  mostly black, like nightmares  and the picture of it above, which is golden and rather beautiful.

Theres a reason for this.

Le Cinq would not let us photograph their food, as we usually do after Ive reviewed, and insisted that we use press shots. This is extremely unusual. However, I did take pictures during the meal, on an iPhone 7 using the available light. And that makes things a little clearer, as you can see.

	<TEXT> It's because BLM and other modern movements are inherently a bit insecure. Being leaderless, and to an extent rudderless, movements, they can much more easily be trivialized, marginalized, and just plain laughed off, not to mention potentially co-opted, than a movement with leaders that can better and more easily push back against any attempt to co-opt or marginalize the movement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if the cost to employ someone would bankrupt the company, you don't hire that person   

That's a bit of an extreme example, but in a less extreme example of just costing the company a lot of money, there is definitely a principle of hiring a person regardless of whether they're controversial or not. I'm not by any means saying it's the case here, but sometimes the most controversial candidate may be the best candidate (again, not the case here). That doesn't mean they should be excluded because of possible protests or violence though, since that is akin to appeasement, such as giving in to terrorism or other forms of violence. It's a form of surrender. </TEXT>

I'm not sure Occam's razor applies here, since her having previous enemies (although those are weaker ties to security risks for her than her present job IMO) doesn't require more assumptions, but the simplest and IMO the most plausible one involves rowdy protesters who have no problem blocking her from doing her job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd argue that it matters, if only because it was such a widespread and intergenerational shunning of something that had such a huge impact. Nobody is going to call *The Social Network* the greatest movie of all time (or even a great movie at that). They might not even call it a good movie. The same can't be said for Kane.    
Also, the timing is different. Zuckerberg could ban all references to the movie from Facebook, but it wouldn't have nearly the impact that Hearst blacklisting the film had. Also, unlike Hearst with *Citizen Kane*, it's a lot less likely that this will become an intergenerational thing.  </TEXT>

They probably can't tell anyone else, because of IP restrictions and especially if created on company time, but they donut have to tell the company.   
Companies that value innovation from their employees will reward it accordingly and those that don't won't, and will get fewer ideas as a result. It's not a right vs wrong thing, it's just a company's culture and management. </TEXT>

My concern with Russia, and particularly Putin is much larger than Ukraine though. My concern is that he, and what at least seems like a large group of people in Russia and scattered throughout its former satellites, wants to recreate the Societ Union. There is an obsession, for lack of a better word, with bringing back the power and perceived respect that they had back then. That is rightfully scary to its neighbors who don't want to be under Russia's influence/control and to NATO, which does not want to deal with another Soviet regime gobbling up its neighbors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On one hand, there is a very real goal/standard in many cultures that lighter skin is better, and even though that standard has very real negative effects, companies have to (to an extent) follow what people want to buy. On the other hand, it is relevant how much do these companies help perpetuate and reinforce these negative cultural biases with advertising like this.   
Skin care companies especially, are often caught between a rock and a hard space. On the one hand, they can't be expected to forego sales by not marketing to, or outright ignoring what a large segment of the market is looking for. On the other hand, how many dark skinned people, even in relatively progressive countries like England are using lightening products but might not if they had a harder time identifying and/or buying products like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> America != Europe, or heavily European inspired countries like Canada. Unlike many other countries, we have a very different history that is based in large part on not letting the government run things unless there is a good reason to. Add a large dash of individuality, and it's a tough thing to overcome to make the case that the government should be running all health insurance.   

If that wasn't enough, even though there would be very real advantages to government run health insurance, the idea of letting the government fund R D for drugs and medical technologies and then own a piece, if not all of the result has major problems, not least of which is how to still incentivize private money in the process (which would still be a necessity) while controlling prices and allowing/incentivizing multiple companies to compete on formulations and other relevant designs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> they introduced a substantial hike on a product with no competitor which literally saves lives   

To play devil's advocate, the former isn't something they'll ever see as their problem, despite the fact that they've lobbied for that monopoly, and the latter is not something they ever need or want to concern themselves with. Saving lives is nice for PR, I'm sure, but they aren't in the job of saving lives, they're in the job of selling a product. If that product saves lives, then that's just the same as the result of anything else they sell.   

Price gouging is, outside of specific laws ~~designed to limit supply of essentials during an emergency~~...wait that's not right...~~designed encourage hoarding~~~...wait, not that either...designed to control the price that people can sell products for during an emergency, is a purely subjective term. Without getting too much into moral relativism, there is no way to substantiate what is and isn't price gouging for a product with a steady demand, such as essential medications. They can and will pay what the market will bear, but barring outside influences (such as new government rules), that isn't going to change a whole lot. That actually supports the idea that they were, on a purely economic level, undercharging for their product, since they could have been charging the higher price for much longer. </TEXT>

As far as I can tell (IANAL btw), the action is being brought because they are paying rebates to PBMs. If other companies are paying rebates as well, which seems likely, and Mylan is just paying higher than the competition, which the article implies, then Mylan will probably will win unless they're doing something else like colluding with the PBMs.   
Both the company and the PBMs wanting to make a profit, is not the same, and that statement as a reason to say that it is unfair, should be treated like a joke. I say good luck to the plaintiffs though if that's the tact they want to take. </TEXT>

Mylan's price hikes were in themselves perfectly legitimate (i.e. allowed by laws and regulations).     
If other companies don't use these rebates like this then it may be a legitimate issue, but this smacks of revenge for the price increase, pure and simple. You can call that justified if you want, but it's a stretch to call it justice since it won't make them lower the price. </TEXT>

The place where pressure should be placed is on Congress and the FDA to reform the system so that more competition can exist. </TEXT>
