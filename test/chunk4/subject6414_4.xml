	<TEXT> I know exactly what your going through. I'm in a similar position myself; I have no real, close friends, and I feel lonely and depressed. I just relapsed yesterday too, and I hated myself for failing again, hated myself for what I was. Everything seems so black, bleak and grey and meaningless. 

But I have hope that things will get better. Even though I haven't seen the light, I have seen glimpses of it in my life. I little something here, a little something there, enough to convince me that I can get out of this place, can achieve my goals and dreams. So please, have hope. I know it sounds stupid and cliche, but my experience has showed me that there is hope, there is a way out, there is a meaning to living. There are people out there who care about you, this community included.

	<TEXT> I agree with you, some people take this way to far, even abstaining from sex because they consider it a relapse. And I also agree that just abstaining from PMO is not *the* reason he got laid. But NoFap is a lifestyle change that goes beyond not fapping, and these other changes are what presumably helped him get laid. That said, there are benefits to not fapping, and this no doubt helped him get where he is now. </TEXT>
