	<TITLE> Question about gifts... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-08 05:09:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello again everyone, 
First off, I wanted to thank everyone so much for the support in my last post. It really did help me out and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. 
As for the situation at the moment, my cousin is rapidly deteriorating and the fluid buildup in her stomach and chest is happening more quickly, they drained 9 liters off her stomach yesterday. She said the clinical trials the doctors want her in won't start for another month and I think she's scared to wait that long. Last night she flat out told me "I'm dying of cancer. It's only a matter of time and it sucks." 
My heart is breaking and sometimes I can't find the right words to say, I just want to hug her and take her pain away. 
I will be going to visit her next week and I wanted to bring her some gifts or something, but for some reason I can't figure out what to bring. My question is, what kinds of things might be best? I wasn't sure about food items as she's still on chemo, tons of pain killers, and the fluid buildup kills her appetite. I just wondered what kind of stuff anyone who has ever gone through cancer or treatment for cancer most appreciated receiving. 
Thank you for reading, all your advice is greatly appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the advice :) As of today, she's starting to come out of it I think. She's actually laying right next to her sister on my moms bed right now and hasn't been hissing as much, she's letting us pet her, and she's kind of playing. So I'm hoping its over with. I have just never seen her act like that and it was awful, she acted like a feral cat. But thank you for your advice and if she starts acting up again I'll definitely do what you suggested :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If this is not allowed, please delete and I apologize. I just figured this is probably the best place to ask this.
I've had two cats that are sisters for five years now. They are both spayed, completely indoor cats (never stepped foot outside, they're too scared), and out of the five years we've had them they have both been the most friendly and lovely cats ever. They got along so great, never any issues with either of them.
Well, Monday night our friend stayed the night and brought his five month old kitten, as he was giving it to a friend whom could give it a better home the next morning. It was a male and my cats have never been around other cats. They were upset, hissing and hiding, and I finally put it in its carrier to sleep for the night. My friend left with it the next morning, so all was said and done.
So the next day, my cat Lucy is still upset. Hissing and growling at everyone that comes within five feet of her, especially her sister. Its now two days later and she's still hiding, hissing and growling, and her entire demeanor is a polar opposite. I mean, this cat was such a big baby. Followed you around, was very happily vocal, ran and played constantly, and now its like she's feral. She is eating, drinking, and using the litter box though, so I'm hoping its nothing health wise going on. 
But I was just wondering if anyone had any insight or advice for a situation like this, I was going to call my vet tomorrow but I'm not sure how helpful they'll be. I really really do not want to get rid of her or put her outside, but I cannot have her attacking my other cat, my dog, or my mom. She's beginning to lunge at us now. 
Thank you so very much for reading, I'm at such a loss and love my kitty dearly but I have no idea what to do.  </TEXT>

Just try to relax, don't lay down too soon so you don't get heartburn or indigestion. Usually it just takes patience to let it digest and for the feelings to go away. I hope you feel better soon!  </TEXT>

My cousin actually got the results of her pet-scan and it's contained in the pleura around her lungs, stomach, and intestines right now but has not spread to any other organs. I was so happy to hear that! I know once it usually starts spreading it can happen pretty fast so hearing that was kind of a relief.

	<TITLE> Antibiotics and probiotics. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-31 18:22:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello everyone,
I had a quick question regarding the use of probiotics while taking antibiotics.
I was prescribed Clindamycin for an infected tooth and gum yesterday, but was warned about the possible severe diarrhea, colitis, and c-diff complications. I know that with any antibiotic comes the risk of diarrhea but I guess this one can be a doozy. 
So when I picked it up from my pharmacy, my pharmacist pulled me aside to talk to me about it because of my history with IBS-D. He suggested that since I'm lactose intolerant and cannot eat yogurt or anything, that I take this Floragen Acidophilus probiotic. It has 20 billion live cultures per capsule and he said it is what most people recommended and take.
I've never even taken a probiotic before but I know some are prone to causing diarrhea when you first start them. 
My question is has anyone tried this probiotic or taken probiotics while on a strong antibiotic? Or should these probiotics really help while I'm taking them? I'm terrified to start this antibiotic cause I have a history of being hospitalized due to severe diarrhea, but I can't risk this infection getting worse or spreading. 
Thank you for any advice or input!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey I'm sorry you're having a rough time, its night time here but I'm not sure about you. 
First off, try to just walk around a little and take a few deep breaths. Try your hardest to relax a little. Maybe sipping some water would help.
Anxiety is the worst, and I'm sure thats probably the most of what you're feeling right now. If you're stomach is really upset, try some 7up, ginger ale, Pepto, an anti-emetic if you have one at your disposal and see if that helps. 
Just keeping yourself distracted helps a ton. I hope you get to feeling better soon :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And that she is also incurable at this point. This is her second run with Triple Negative breast cancer, and it started out this time with a mass behind her sternum. It has now spread to the pleura around her intestines and elsewhere. 
They will continue chemo to try and fight it as long as possible, along with some other types of drugs and possibly clinical trials at the Mayo Clinic. She didn't want to know how long she has left but was told she has a 22% chance of survival at this point. 
I grew up without my family and just a couple years ago, they came back into my life. My cousin has been such a great friend, listener, supporter, and she's just all around fantastic. I love her so dearly and I'm so heartbroken over this. She is not giving up the fight, but is finding it hard to not lose hope. I was the very first out of the family to receive this news, so now I'm waiting for everyone else to find out. 
Has anyone else ever dealt with, either themselves or a loved one or family member, stage four triple negative breast cancer? Even with the drugs and chemo, how fast does it grow? I'm just looking for insight ir advice to better prepare for what's coming and to be there for my cousin, well, my entire family is by her side. But any advice, information, or insight is greatly appreciated.
Thank you so much for reading.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, its not your fault. Don't beat yourself down like that, you didn't ask to have emetophobia, it happened. Take a deep breath and try to just relax for a bit. 
I've been in your situation so many times, and the only reason I ever feel sick is because of my anxiety. When I have an attack like that, I'm hyper aware of my body, looking and waiting for any little symptom to pop up and feed my fear. 
You're probably just sore from the day itself and getting anxious doesn't help, unfortunately. Just try to distract yourself for a while or try to sleep. 
You made a huge step, be proud of that! :) Its going to take times like these to get to where you want to be with your phobia. Just roll with the punches :) 
If everyone else is feeling fine, I honestly wouldn't worry. Plus, in my experience at least, once food poisoning hits, it REALLY hits and you'll most def know you've got food poisoning. Nachos are kinda heavy and greasy anyways and always kind of sit heavy on my stomach, but have never made me v*. 
I really hope you feel better and don't let this discourage you! Keep taking these steps, they're gonna make a world of difference :) You've totally got this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly cannot stand people who are either sick, catching something, or just getting over something who show up to peoples house or parties. Granted, if they're getting over it, its highly unlikely they're contagious, but still. 
If he's at least eating and out of the house (at a party nonetheless) then he shouldn't be contagious or even carrying germs. Unless he's actively been sick right before coming there or at the party, cause remember how you catch these things - coming in contact with or ingesting v* or feces particles. Its highly unlikely he's spreading either of those two things there. 
Just try to remember logically how you could catch it and try to get your mind off of it and enjoy the party. Just avoid him if its bothering you that bad and just wash your hands, and even ask your boyfriend if he could please wash his hands, as you're this worried. 
I truly feel you though, I hate when I'm in a situation like this but I just try to use the knowledge I have about it and try to have a good time :)  </TEXT>

So, long story short, I suffer from chronic pain, gastro problems, anxiety, and manic depression. I hate taking pills, they make me feel even worse, so I figured maybe cannabis is the way to go at this point. 
My question to all of you is - is there a certain type I should try? I know there's so many different strains and I used to just smoke whatever my fiance had, but its been years. 
I'm not looking to just get ripped, I want something that just straight up helps the pain, nausea, anxiety, etc.

Just try eating a little something before you take it and drinking plenty of water.
