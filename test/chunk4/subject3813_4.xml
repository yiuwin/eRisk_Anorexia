	<TEXT> Just wait. You won't be able to find any reputable artist who will tattoo underage. You'll end up with a terrible tat or hepatitis.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all! I'm transferring to sb as a junior this upcoming fall, and I need housing. I would rather not live in a dorm, and I'm trying to find female roommates to share a house. I know about the stony brook roommate referral on the off campus housing site, but most of the posts are old. I don't really know anyone that goes to stony brook. Any ideas how I can find roommates? Thanks ahead of time! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help! Part of my three week old tattoo has vanished! No, I'm not kidding! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I got a tattoo at House of Colour in Bayshore, Ny, about three weeks ago. The tattoo is "All was well" and three stars on my right foot. It's very small(less than an inch tall) and finely lettered. It is still partially raised, and is not flaking or itching. I never once picked at it or scratched it, and put the ointment they gave me at the tattoo parlor on it at least once a day. Now, the middle line in the "a" is totally gone! In addition, an "s" is significantly fading. Wtf is going on? Did the tattoo place fuck up? Did I not take care of it correctly? Help!!!

Here is a shitty pic because it is very hard to take a picture of your own foot without covering it in shadow. Sorry it is upside down, I can't seem to get it to save properly after I rotate it.
