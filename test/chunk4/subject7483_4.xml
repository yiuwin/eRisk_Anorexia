	<TEXT> What is more surprising than Dunkirk is the Battle of France itself, the Germans only had ammunition and fuel for a few months of war. They also lacked motor transport, something needed for their war of movement. Had France held the Germans back along with the BEF the war could very well have ended much sooner. That said, the French government and military was in chaos and used antiquated tactics.   </TEXT>
