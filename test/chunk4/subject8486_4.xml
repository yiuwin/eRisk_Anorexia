	<TEXT> Saying your favorites are green and black is a bit like saying your favorite wine is "red".  There's a huge variety of different green and black teas.  

My favorite black teas are Assam and Keemun.  Both are a good brisk morning tea.  Even within those categories there are a bazillion choices.  I drink them with milk and sweetener.  But there are other teas, like a nice Orange Spice, that I just drink with sweetener.

My recommendation: go to http://uptontea.com and order their catalog.  Then go through and order a bunch of their 10-cup sample packets for a buck or two, and see what you like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like it might actually be more efficient to use the debit card instead of taking a ticket every day - assuming it works consistently. The time saved would be more than outweighed by the lost time if the attendant has to come over and you have to explain the situation to him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got a bunch of clear plastic bins and tried to sort them into standard pieces/flat pieces/special pieces/minifigs.  It kind of worked, but my kids weren't that into Legos.

	<TEXT> Unless you have a huge driveway, I'd say shovel through the whole winter to see how much work it is.  You won't fully appreciate the snowblower until you've shovelled.
