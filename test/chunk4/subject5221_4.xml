	<TEXT> So I want to start working on a desk with a PC built in it. I have everything sorted out in my plans except one thing. The i/o . How would you guys suggest sticking that out the back. I don't really want to leave gaps between the ports and all that jazz and the i/o aluminium shield seems so fragile to mess with in a wooden desk. Any ideas or other posts that could give me some ideas?? Thanks in advance guys.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I already have dust filters on every fan. Unfortunately the case has kind of shitty fans... 2 on the panels which I can only replace if I cut trough the metal because I didn't see any way to get them out of the casing and they are very weak you can't even feel the air when you put your hand against them... And 2 other fans, one in the front and one in the back which are reasonably strong the problem is that the air is not circulating in and out of the case as fast as i want there is a large amount of air circulating but really slow </TEXT>
