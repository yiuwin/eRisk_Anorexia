	<TEXT> I love this comment.  Ents were slow to anger but when they decided to fight its all over.

So this means we are at the end of the two towers and destroyed Saurman (Clinton).  So now we defend and defeat against the ultimate evil Sauron (Soros)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So here is why I don't like anti-war protests.  As a soldier, when they return home and see these protests what am I to think?  I've just put my life on the line for nothing?  My sacrifice is for nothing?

That's why even if I'm against a war I wouldn't protest out on the streets or on social media. 

I'd protest by voting for an anti-war candidate such as President Trump. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She is currently ahead in the popular vote by about 400k, or .2%.  That would be great if we used the popular vote to decide elections.

I'll use a football analogy.  A team dominated possession of the ball, always on the field.  The other team though, scored more points because that's how you win.  Should the other team protest the score knowing that it is whoever has more points wins? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What?  I thought we treated kids the same as adults.  I explained to my 5 year old everything about spirit cooking, grabbing the vagina, Bill having an affair and his rape accusations.

He agreed with me on how the emails were a much more serious issue but the FBI was being blocked by the DOJ.

WAIT WAIT WAIT!!!

He's 5!  I told him two people are running for President.  I disagree with one and I'm voting for the other.  He shrugged and I continued to read a Jingle Bells pop-up book with him.

	<TEXT> Corinthians has the best definition of love I've ever seen.  It's referring to God's love for us but can be applied everywhere.

"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.

And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Time for my best Andre the Giant story I heard on a documentary!

He was at a bar drinking when four guys started harassing him.  He was a gentle giant for the most part and ignored them.  They finally pushed him far enough that he stood up to face them.  All four ran to a small car and Andre followed them.  He ended up pushing the car over with all four of them in the car. </TEXT>
