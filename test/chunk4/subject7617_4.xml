	<TEXT> or people can use it to kill time in line, or while sitting and waiting for others to finish their meal, or sitting and waiting for the fireworks/parade etc. yes there probably will be people wandering and looking at their phones, but...people do that A LOT now as it is. I've seen it in the parks all the time. If that is their typical behavior, that behavior won't change. But, if this game can make the "waiting" aspects of disney more bearable, then cool. Also...it's a super fun game :) it actually interacts with landmarks in your neighborhood so i find it actually gets me out more and going to places i don't  normally. </TEXT>

He really disliked the parks, though did enjoy dinners at resorts, parasailing ,etc. In the first few days, i really guilted him about not ruining my vacation. I really should have just been more lenient, understood it wasnt his favorite thing, and let him go take breaks mid day, instead of making him feel bad about it (though in my defense, he complained a LOT haha). Still, i could've handled it better too. 

We now agree that he won't be coming back until we have future kids, but that I'll be going plenty with friends + solo. Sometimes you just gotta accept someone isn't going to love every single thing you love! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys! So, I had the opportunity to go to PAX East in April and came across a game called Dead by Daylight. It's a little hard to explain other than it's a multiplayer, classic horror style game. One killer, 4 victims trying to survive. They recently sent me an email with a BUTTLOAD of keys for beta this week, which makes sense considering it's a multiplayer beta. Need people playing to be fun, right? Anyway, I'd like to give them out to you guys because you've been such an awesome community to be a part of. So, please send me a PM and i'll give away what ive got :) It's on Steam, and PC only I'm afraid. [Check out the game here](http://www.deadbydaylight.com/) **EDIT: All keys have been given away! Thanks for reaching out, guys! Hope to see you on the game this week :)** </TEXT>

And it does the flames in a circle move, but they don't circle around, and then it just disappeared. And then there's just fire shooting everywhere, and the other 2 hell guards don't show up. I can't do anything but jump around the flames. I kill myself by burning myself to death, and sure enough it didn't checkpoint or anything, so I have to restart the boss fight all over again.

	<TEXT> So I'm an idiot. I ordered sushi for lunch today and didn't pay that much attention to the tuna i ordered. I ordered "white tuna" instead of regular tuna. That was a bad idea. Turns out a lot of places sell a fish called escolar as "white tuna". It's not tuna at all and it's known to have an oil people can't digest, so it's called the "ex-lax fish". I am so glad that I only ate 2 pieces of the sushi roll before I found this out. A co worker was like "oh, dont worry you need to eat like 6 oz before it makes you sick." Well, they don't know I have IBS. I may have ingested about 2, 2.5 oz but within 20 minutes I was running to the bathroom. Peeing. out. my. butt.

I am doing better now, an hour later + imodium. But word to the wise... dont do white tuna/escolar. Not even a little bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While enjoying the pool with a couple of friends at Wilderness Campgrounds, we were taking turns on the slide. This was a couple of years ago, i was about 26, 27. I had a bikini top on that had ties for both behind the neck and behind my back and let me tell you, the fabric they give is just not enough to keep those ties tight. The friction of the pool slide undid that top neck tie, completely. Luckily I realized this as i entered the pool and didn't actually lose the top, but held it real close to me as i kept my body underwater and retied it. I almost flashed a bunch of little kids that day, plus my best guy friend.  Needless to say, i chucked that bikini for a more secure new one! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you can compromise here. I think you may want to work on your anxiety a bit. It's something I've had to do myself but then I'm able to say, travel and go on vacation with my boyfriend, or go out to a bar, or what have you At the same time you work on that, he needs to understand that it makes you just as sad when you ARE too sick to go out, and its nothing against him. He can try and be more supportive in those scenarios where doing something fun just isn't an option. I think if you both work on it from your ends, you'll be OK. My boyfriend and I have been together 4 years, 3.5 of those I've had IBS. We're going strong because we try to be empathetic to each other around the problem. Also, sometimes we come to a compromise that I don't feel well but he should still go out and be social with his friends etc. and not feel guilty. But i think because we've been together so long that's a little easier to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2 days is definitely not enough time, unless you are doing only the Magic Kingdom. You have 4 parks and on my recent trip, in 3 days I only did 3 of them and felt rushed. 5 days is ideal minimum amount of time. If the cost of rooms offsite is cheaper for you than a value hotel at disney (which range from about $89 to $120 or so depending on time of year) then definitely go for it, if you've got transportation locked down. The benefit to onsite is free transportation (ie, buses from hotels to parks). 

Remember that the more days you go to parks, the cheaper (per day cost) the tickets are. Play around with the prices on the site and you'll see what I mean. If park hopping doesn't matter to you, meaning going to multiple parks in a single day, you can save by eliminating that option on your tickets. </TEXT>

It was quite possibly the best vacation down there I've had in years. Single rider lines are awesome. You get to do whatever you want, whenever you want, eat whatever you want, wake up whenever you want... etc etc. I had a HELL of a time.

	<TITLE> Annual Pass Question </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-10 03:38:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Everyone, considering my first annual pass next year after 11+ trips to the world. I forsee an 8 day trip coming up and then likely a 4-5 day one later in the year. Anyway, I live in NYC, so I know that when you buy an AP, you get a voucher which you then have to turn in for the actual pass at the parks, which is then activated. SO, does this mean that some of the special hotel discounts I could get for being a passholder, would NOT be able to be applied for my first trip, because I'd have to book the hotel before I had a chance to get down here an activate my pass?  </TEXT>

I also don't care when it's multiplayer. I choose who i like the best, that may not always be the female character. In games like Rainbow Six Siege, where each have their own abilities, I always pick Sledge, a dude, because I love his abilities. I don't care at all that he's male and i don't wish he was female. I guess i just don't care enough/think about it enough. I'd feel more burned if someone picked a character i wanted for their perks, but never for their gender. </TEXT>
