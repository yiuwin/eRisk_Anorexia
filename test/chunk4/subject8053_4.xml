	<TEXT> I just came back from maple after a few years break. I'm on a fresh new account in Broa and i'm wondering the best way to fund myself. If i were to buy a $10 nx card and sell it, how much will i be able to sell it for and what are the best items i could buy with that money? Thanks. 

Additional Info: level 110 Hero, no funded friends, ign:CDIZZLE </TEXT>
