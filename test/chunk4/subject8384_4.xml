	<TEXT> Hallo,

ich recherchiere gerade etwas ber Deutschland und bin etwas verwirrt ber das deutsche System. Es gibt die ARD, ZDF und Deutschlandradio und dann noch 9 Landesrundfunkanstalten. Jedoch taucht nirgendswo der Begriff das Erste auf obwohl der Sender so heit? Wie kann man sich die Hierarchie vorstellen?

Danke fr Hilfe!

	<TITLE> [BF4] Can I buy Battlefield 4 Premium on PS3 and use it on PS4? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-12 15:24:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I dont know what to do, in Europe Battlefield 4 Premium is on sale for 15 Euros but for the PS3 only. I already own Battlefield 4 on PS4 but I want Premium without having to pay 50 Euros. Can I buy Premium on PS3 and use it on PS4? Has anyone experience with this? I dont even understand why EA only put the PS3 version on sale not the PS4 one as well.

Sorry for my bad english!

Thank You! </TEXT>
