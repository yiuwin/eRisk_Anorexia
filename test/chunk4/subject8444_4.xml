	<TEXT> I know this would never happen, but it would be pretty neat if your "career" altered depending on your style of play. You could start say as a tactical captain, but because you rely heavily on engineering abilities (I know some of those abilities being to BOFFs) your career path title changes.

Also with how the skills are now I feel that you can play whatever role you want regardless of career anyways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If Tarbell hasn't graduated from his GA contract he is automatically protected.

Honestly I think leaving Dawkins unprotected would be a small gamble, leave Amarikwa off as he is recovering from injury. Probably gamble on Wynne as his salary is high. 

For me the real question is Ceren and Quintero. I hope we can keep Colvey too.

One would think protecting Wondo is a no brainer, but I wonder if either team would take him? I figure at this point Wondo is Quakes til he dies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know a bunch of people gave you advice on how to fix your ship build. I want to point out to make sure that your BOFF abilities are set to auto-execute do that they are being utilized. (I play on Xbox so I don't know your key bindings but this post is easy to follow) first make sure your power levels are set to weapons. Use right on the D-pad to cycle the four squares on the bottom left corner to the fuss square on the left. That will increase your attack, allowing you to do maximum damage. Now on the bottom right you have your 5 ability icons that you can activate by pressing the respective button. If you hold down each button it will open a radial menu with all your other abilities. If you use r1 (right bumper?) You will cycle the option for auto execute if available. You will see under the radial menu options to activate, set as main or auto. Autoing these abilities will help a lot.

If you already knew this, feel free to ignore maybe others will find it useful. I have a couple links to guides for people starting to learn. If you are interested let me know. They should pop up on google, although some are a bit out of date.

I used this one http://sto.necrobones.com/science-dps.html it was written before the skills revamp (and also for pc) from what I can tell. But the basic ideas are there. It talks about DPSing in a science ship, but I found the advice to be useful in cruisers too. How this helps </TEXT>
