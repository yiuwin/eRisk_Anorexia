	<TEXT> It is a very interesting point you bring up, I myself am in a similar position at 27 and now understanding the true history of the day and our treatment of original Australians. 

I don't know to be honest. I mean you can go all out and protest the day at a number of different rallies I am sure will be popping up tomorrow. 

Then again, Australia day has come to represent so much more about Australia then just the historical context. It is now about, mate-ship, multiculturalism and inclusiveness and so much more.

Id say, make the day your own and celebrate how awesome this country and people are, I know that's what I want to do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all, just testing the waters for how many people would turn out to a workshop or some such. 

I just couldn't believe we don't have one in Sydney somewhere. 

My idea was just to go to a major sydney park (hyde park probably) where we can frolick around with lightsabers and do some good training with fellow star wars nerds.

Afterwoods we could just sit around and talk star wars in general, or exercise our brains with star wars philosophy and some casual debate. 

So, if you are keen or think of something else that would be awesome in addition to this let me know.


Needed:
 - martial artist that knows sword play.
- some philosophy students
- star wars nerds and proud of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As it says above. Looking for fun times and some ranked games with a good group of people.

On the NA server but am an Aussie and will be playing from the AEST time (sydney time).

So if you want to add me and play some ranked games that would be cool.

I have only got a few ships.

- Pensacola
- Gernvery
- hatsuharu

Some other ships that prob won't be able to play ranked with.

I play most days, drop me a line.
