That is a really tired argument that ignores a bigger issue wherein we push kids to get a degree, not a passion.

Go get lost for a year an find your passion. Maybe you don't need to go school right now. Maybe you want to teach English in Nepal or ride elephants in Thailand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indian

Be careful with that word around some of the younger tribe members. They never get pissed off, but Native is much more preferable. I go to a small college that gives free tuition to native kids and most of them don't like Indian because of how it was once used. 

I know that 90% of the time no one is being derogatory when they say Indian, but some people have ruined it. And, do note that Native American can be equally awkward. I'm Irish, Dermont is Native, and Erik is Norwegian. At the end of the day we're all people, but Dermont and I drink too much. We aren't helping our stereotype at all </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's with all the downvotes. It is a bad argument because it is a burden of proof and it diverts from the issue at hand.

If a lobster is reacting in such a way that clearly demonstrates that it does not want to be acted on in such a way, we should not act this way.

Also, to address the claim "they don't feel pain as we experience it", we cannot ever know if this is true. If we are talking about pain as qualia this argument would go to say that I am the only one to feel pain. We can extend this argument further if we assume the argument with crabs concludes with "keep eating them because they don't suffer"

1. Your reaction from an injury is yours bodies response to protect you. 


2. This doesn't mean you are suffering like I am. 

3. I can go onto harm you because you are not suffering.

The problems of the qualia argument is its broader applications. This is largely a problem with any consequential view. This is why I prefer a deontological view on the subject, "don't eat animals because it is categorically imperative". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've got a lot more to infer now. 

 I've let the air out of some tires or put masking tape over their cars in the same linear direction as the parking stripes, though. Or give them a particularly vulgar business card.

This is not justice. You are acting out of ego, not anything remotely deontological, like justice. You ruin the day of those who you fail to park properly. They did not ruin your day. Maybe they were maybe a minor inconvenience and you took it upon yourself to greatly inconvenience them. Instead of giving them flat tires, vulgar notes, or tape to clean up, try showing them the categorical imperatives of the parking lot. Make it ironic or reasonable, I don't care. You have committed revenge, not justice. 

I prefer these methods because who knows how douchey the individual parking like an asshat is - they could be willing to damage your car to get into their own or to return the point. I don't like giving them that option.

...

**You're inferring** a lot from my sentence.

You are also inferring a lot from one's action. What if they were in a rush to pick up their injured daughter, to get to work, or maybe they simply didn't realize how they parked. Maybe they knowingly blocked three parking spots. Maybe they felt entitled. That's their problem. You are always gonna have those people and they probably won't change from the aggressive actions of a stranger. If you really want to change their minds, speak in such a way that they will care.

No stranger deserves to have the air let out of their tires without a proper introduction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought two hits from my friend's cousin. He didn't have blotter, but a vial. I was pretty intrigued because I haven't seen acid in its liquid form yet. He pulled it out of a black silk sack, grabbed two sour patch kids, some tinfoil, put a drop on each candy, individually wrapped them up in the intentionally mangled foil which the candies were on, placed the two little rectangular foil wrapped candies in a little drug baggy, and all in less than a minute. This guy looked like he knew what to do and I trusted my friends testimonies of this acid, but, as I sit here two and a half hours after taking one of the hits and almost an hour after I decided to take the other hit, I begin to question the potency of whatever I bought. I bought the acid a week ago, wrapped the drug baggy in foil and put in a sandwich bag that has been in the freezer since this morning. 

I let the sandwich bag containing the foil wrapped drug baggie containing foil wrapped acid dosed candies come to room temperature. I let the candies sit under my tongue until it breaks at the slightest pressure and chew it into nothing.

I'm pretty disappointed thus far. I've taken acid once before and eaten mushrooms a few times. Okay. So this was supposed to be a post about me ranting about how my acid isn't kicking in blah blah blah. Well it just did. Peace out now. I'm gonna go reflect quietly in the dark for the rest of the night

Update: Uh, thanks for all the feedback? The acid was slow to kick in and a little weaker than I anticipated. I still had a great night of writing, introspection, and a little bit of levitating (probably the coolest experience of my life. I meditated on my carpet with my eyes open and watched the carpet wave to the beat of the music. The carpet made little streams that pulled the waves toward me. It was breathtaking). I wasn't looking for feedback on storing acid, because nobody knows for certain, nor can they know, what the best method of storing acid. Please do not take this too rashly but, the authors of the sources I used to learn about storing LSD carries more ethos than a redditor (I can get some references in here if you guys and gals want). I'm all for discussing what sources are more credible over reddit, but not the substance of the sources. I'm not a chemist and I wouldn't believe you if you told me you were. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Philosophy is really difficult. Wittgenstein wrote the entire Tractatus to get his doctorate and barely scraped. Some say he was only given his Doctorate because Bertrand Russell wrote the preface. 

That's quite a standard if you ask me. Obviously it is feasible, but writing a dissertation on some ruins you found in the Congo is gonna be less intimidating than creating a new philosophical concept.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They would have taken down this place if it was doing something like this illegally. They have kids that work one of the worst jobs at the entire place and they don't get paid an hourly after 8 hours a day (but they get twice as many tips as I do). If they haven't sued yet, because they are prone to doing such, then there must be some sort of loophole. I'm just asking if anyone knows what that would be. 

And are all the downvotes because I generalized a bunch of old grumpy Jewish ladies. Don't kid yourself now. They all act very predictable. Know a groups behavior isn't racism. Especially if you have been living around them for the majority of your life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one has mentioned San Luis yet? It's an easy hike. It becomes a knife ridge at the end, but it's not unsettling at all, very easy. It can be accessed from Creede and Saguache. We were able to hike it pretty early last year. I think it was early June and we only had to walk through a few strips of snow. It wasn't good for horses or dogs though. We encountered a french woman hiking the CDT with mules. This was her first encounter with snow and the mules were struggling. We ended up turning around, finding her a trailer to get the mules into Creede, and summiting the next day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you only get paid for 8 hours of work even if you work 13 hours? I work as a valet at a beach club working for tips. I just put in 4 11-13 hour days and found out afterwards that I only got paid for 8 hours. Do they expect me to leave without all the patrons taking their cars? Are they just going to sleep at the beach club that day?

At 8 hours I am not getting anymore cars to wash or park. I just need to collect tips and then I can leave. I am working extra hours and not getting paid purely out of duty. It's necessary that I work 12 hours to do my job completely.

I know that this doesn't have to deal with kitchens, but relates to the service industry as a whole, and this was kind of a vent, but does anyone else have to deal with this kind of issue? </TEXT>

I pointed out to this guy that we were at a major intersection with many cameras, two police officers, and that I had a knife (as if that would do anything). I gave him a piece of gum and he went on his merry way.

Little did he know, I had $5,000 cash and my $1,000 laptop in my backpack. There was a reason I hung around that intersection, but I was surprised how bold and nice this mugger was. That was the first time someone's tried to mug me lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was working as a server at a hot springs resort. I walked around, took drink orders, and socialized with the guests. The job was easy, TOO easy. I was pretty depressed at the time. Just a few months prior I had gotten out of a 10 week impatient program for my eating disorder. I had just moved. I had no friends nor the energy to make friends. My life was pretty underwhelming to say the least.

It was a relatively busy night and I was walking lazily around asking people if they wanted drink orders. I was that kind of depressed where I couldn't force myself to smile. My face was pretty expressionless.

There was a older women, a sixty something, that heckled me to smile more. I gave a little smirk (the best I could do) and without any eye contact or pause in my stride said, "If I had the ambition to smile I would" as a means to convey how depressed I was. She didn't want a drink, so I moved on to the pools near by.

On my rounds some texans rancher wannabees with their immaculate cowboy hats that probably never saw a day on the ranch ironically ordered a few frozen margaritas. I headed back to the gazebo to get their order together and fill out a room charge slip for them. On my way back my heckler made another request on the basis of my facial expression.

I told her I would try my best and produced a smile she saw as permissible without making a comment. I made the drinks and proceeded back to the texans, passing her again. This time I had nothing to show. She made a much more sincere remark "Honey, you can't walk around with that face on. You need to smile more". This got under my skin. A women who didn't know who I was or what my history was criticizing me for my lacking emotions. I gathered up the will to give her eye contact and boldly said, "I'm sorry I can't help you on that. I'm trying, I really am, but I'm just not well right now".

We get into a conversation about depression and she gives me some great advice on how to live my life. Her husband comes over and gives his own wisdom. Fast forward ten minutes, the frozen margaritas have melted, my eyes are red, and tears are dripping down my face and on to my uniform. She gives me a warm, heart felt hug and for the rest of my night I smiled like I was doing exactly what I wanted in life. I was in the middle of a resort where I'm sure I had some patrons and coworkers ease-dropping or watching from a distance. I walked away a little embarrassed and I swear the whole place was spinning around me. 

I made a few fresh margaritas and comped the Texans some popcorn. They were to caught up in their own world to remember that they had ordered drinks. I don't know who that lady was or her husband, but I will never forget them or the feelings they inspired me to feel that night. Two strangers completely changed my life and I am forever grateful.

I still struggle with depression from time to time, but at least I know how to deal with it in an appropriate manner. I honestly was not in the right emotional state to work that job, but its nothing worth regretting. I surprisingly received nothing but great comments and killer tips. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed.  I thought three was terrible. I started out on 1942 and was a fanatical bf2 player. BF3 is too complicated and the combat doesn't shine through like it did in the previous games. I would rather play BF:BC 1   2 over this game. BF3 is all about progression. The tactical elements of the earlier games is really missing. I was hoping they would simplify in BF4, not add more stuff. Lens flares, filters, AC130s, a web of upgrades and progression, and a shitty campaign (just keep the campaign out of the game) make BF3 and BF4 frustrating for me.

Granted, BF3 was a good game. But, I would never compare it to the previous games in the franchise </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. I worked at a place that did the electronic tips, but the owner dished out cash tips whenever she felt like it. She kept all the paychecks and cash tips in her purse. If you wanted either, you had to track her down on one of the three days she showed up to make deserts. I didn't get paid for the first six weeks and didn't get tips for the last month of working there.

 I worked a total of three months there when I left my "Fuck you, I'm finishing my shifts this week and quitting" letter with threats and intentions to call the BBB and a few other places. I said I would come back on date such and such for "the money you owe me". 


I showed up on that day shaking. She was standing by the bar with the bartender and head waiter. She was the only one not smiling. She praised me, offered me my job back, gave me my check, and slipped me $120 cash to keep me quiet.

I was 15. That was my first job.
