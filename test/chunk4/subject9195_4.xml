	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply! I should mention, I'm doing my own modified version of 5x5 strong lifts, focusing on strength 
(so I don't wither away). I'm focusing on muscle retention (at the very least) in the gym, and creating a caloric deficit in the kitchen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've lost 58 lbs. I'm at about 16% body fat (7 tests averaged), and I can't wait till I start bulking. Protein is good, lots of protein, and heavy weight, is better.
