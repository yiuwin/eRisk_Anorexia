	<TEXT> Yeah. The odd thing about Ender's Game was that it was fairly accurate to the book. There wasn't that much changed, not much added, and really not that much removed either. It just wasn't a good movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that's a pretty varied selection of skills. I suppose what I'm getting at with all these questions is trying to find something you've always wanted to do that you could reasonably do before the 14th. There's no disadvantages to finding something like this. Either you'll decide against suicide, or you will have enjoyed yourself in the time you have left. At your age you are not a master at any of those skills you listed, perhaps there's something you could write or create that would make the next few days worthwhile? </TEXT>
