	<TEXT> Yes, I think you're right.  It would probably be tricky to figure out exactly what the device was unless there are more labels or the OP gets really lucky and someone has another one of these.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, E80CC refers to a type of vacuum tube, which corresponds to the mention of "valvo" in the name (vacuum tubes are also called valves).  I imagine it once contained vacuum tubes or something that used them.  I know very little German, but ersatz refers to a substitute or replacement.  Probably a box for replacement vacuum tubes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, these stores generally take donated items and then sell them to raise money for their charities.  However, there are also for-profit versions that either buy used things cheap to resell or even trick people into thinking they are donating to a charity store rather than a profit store.  

Why do people buy random objects?  Some people are impulse buyers who jump on anything that catches their eye.  There are also many people who shop thrift stores to turn a profit.  They are looking for items they could resell and sometimes they take risks on items that look like they might be antiques or rare.  In a thrift shop, the odds are that any given item will be gone when you come back, so it drives people to buy without research. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks like a cherimoya, but the skin is smoother than ones I have seen.  Perhaps the wild ones are smoother - I think it's native to the area.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is simpler than Schlieren, I think they are glass plate photographs from a ripple tank - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_tank 

They appear to show waves bouncing off of different surfaces.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a bag of loose leaf tea, but you'll need someone else with a translation to determine the exact type. </TEXT>
