	<TEXT> Honestly, if I've been restricting for a while, eating a normal meal is physically really painful. It's a total shock to my body to be eating a normal meal when I've been eating 0-500 calories a day (all consisting of several small things throughout the day) for a while. I don't necessarily experience refeeding syndrome, but my stomach is in knots for at least 2 days and...toilet trips. 3+ toilet trips in a day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have any experience with EC stack but I'll share my experiences with fasting. 

I do coffee fasts. Basically all I consume is coffee, water and Sparkling Ice water. I typically do this for 36-48 hours at a time. Emotionally, it takes a toll on me. I'm cranky and tired and irritable and I have an overall negative outlook on life. The first 24 hours are the worst when it comes to hunger and cravings but it gets better the second day. My heart rate increases a lot, I guess you could say mild tachycardia? Like, my resting heart rate will be 140 bpm. I feel a little dizzy going 36 hours into a fast but it's not unbearable. The longest I've ever fasted (this was before I started drinking coffee) was 5 days. For that 5 day fast, I only drank water and diet coke. However, once I did a 4 day fast and on the 4th day I fainted. When I did that 4 day fast, I had been a coffee drinker for a few years but I never included it as a major part of my fasting. I'd drink 1 cup of coffee in the morning to wake me up but that's about it. The rest of the day I'd just drink water here and there, but I still fainted. Now when I fast, I'm drinking upwards to 7 cups of coffee per day. I'm sure the excessive coffee is a contributing factor to my rapid heart rate. 

As far as poops go...when I do coffee fasts, I get the runs. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE runs. Even if I haven't eaten for 24 hours, I still get the runs. I actually made a post earlier saying how I can't drink coffee anymore because of this. I'm fasting until 9am tomorrow but I'm going to take a break from fasting for a while. The bathroom situation is just unbearable. I bet the coffee is what is making my toilet situation bad, but I did read a post here by someone who did a water fast and she said she still got liquid poo despite only drinking water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have consumed copious amounts of coffee in the last 24 hours. I'm 32 hours into my 48 hour coffee fast and I am **d o n e** with coffee. I'll spare you the details, but let me just say that going #2 with barely anything in your system (the last thing I had was a 100 calorie granola bar at around 9am yesterday) is HORRIBLE. I didn't know this was possible. I mean, I've coffee fasted several times before but this time I've probably doubled my normal consumption and the outcome is **brutal**. I need to stop. It's almost 5:30pm meaning 4-5 hours until I go to bed. I've been debating whether or not to end my fast *now* with a few crackers and give myself a pat on the back (out of pity), or just push through until tomorrow morning at around 9am which is when I originally planned to break my fast. I still haven't decided. But no more coffee. No more coffee fasts for a looooong time. At least not ones longer than 24 hours. I usually drink 1 cup of coffee in the morning to wake up but I'm doubting that tomorrow I can/should even drink that one cup. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Soup? There's lots of low sodium versions. If you're feeling up to it, you could make your own and control the sodium. Soup is my go-to safe food. I don't eat it often though solely because of the sodium content. But when I have time, I make big batches of chicken noodle in my slow cooker and freeze single serves of it. Plus it's sou-per filling (I'm so sorry, my puns are embarrassing). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same. I still ride but going to the gym is too exhausting. I usually use the elliptical or treadmill at the gym, but I've been thinking about trying the stationary bike while restricting to see if it's any less grueling. Having 300 calories for the day is bad enough, I feel like working out would just make me feel worse. Plus the more I restrict, the worse my body dysmorphia is, so going to the gym and being surrounded by mirrors is a nightmare.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, fasting makes it harder for me to eat anything, even safe foods. But if you're prone to the binge/restrict then maybe fasting isn't ideal for you right now, but you could always work yourself up to it! Did you have a calorie goal for today? If so, maybe give yourself a slightly higher calorie goal tomorrow and work yourself down. </TEXT>

That is so awful your friends forgot your birthday, I'm so sorry to hear that! Happy birthday from me 3 Your friends don't sound like very good friends, I second you in thinking you might need new friends. It sucks you were DD but hey at least you didn't drink calories in addition to eating them :3

Kids can be the worst. Especially at that pre-teen age. I think you definitely need a California vacation instead of your cousin! Especially with this random "heat wave" here. 

At least this way, I'll be thin and pissed off.

	<TEXT> So I woke up this morning feeling nice and slim. I haven't weighed myself since Thursday because I went out of town over the weekend and didn't restrict, so I've been spending this week fasting and restricting to get rid of the water weight. I *was* planning on weighing myself on Friday but then I got my period :| So now I'm not planning on weighing myself until a few days after my period ends. 

I feel fucking huge. In addition to that, I'm a raging **bitch**. I want to snap at anyone who texts me *anything* because I just want to be left alone. This guy on campus today asked me if I was registered to vote. I said yes, then he asked me to complete a survey. I threw my hands in the air and very rudely said "I have to go to class!". I feel bad about that. My road rage is through the roof. My *red* car is a very accurate representation of my day today. I'm guessing lack of food isn't helping with my mood and irritability but...

I was going to eat something worth 200 calories today for dinner but it's just too stressful trying to figure out what to eat. So I've decided I'm not going to eat. And I'm not going to eat tomorrow either. I'll break my fast at 48 hours before my horseback riding lesson on Friday morning with a granola bar.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just going to say...I feel like it would be a really horrible idea to donate blood if you've been restricting/fasting for a while, therefore lacking essential micronutrients. Even if you're not under 110 pounds. I don't know the biology of that but I'd imagine it wouldn't be very beneficial to the person receiving the donated blood if the donated blood severely lacked nutrients. I'm currently anemic and I've been told not to donate blood until I've gotten blood work done to indicate my iron levels are healthy again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something I can kind of relate to!

2 years ago I started dating this girl I met in eating disorder recovery group. We were sorta friends/acquaintances to start with. We didn't start dating until almost a year after we were out of group. 

ED-wise, things were okay. We would go on dates involving food and we were comfortable eating with each other. We didn't restrict what we ate, and we ate most of what was on our plates. We were a totally normal couple doing totally normal things. However, at this point, both of us were mostly recovered. When we started dating, we also agreed with each other to always be open and honest if we are having ED thoughts/engaging in behaviors so we can help one another.

Emotionally? Holy shit that's a whole other issue. The (very brief) relationship ended disastrously. Although she did just recently ask me to be her friends with benefits.

Honestly, I don't think I could date someone who actively engages in ED behaviors. It's just not healthy for me or the other person. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm approx 42 hours into my fast. I was planning on breaking my fast around the 48 hour mark. It's a coffee fast, so yesterday I had like 5-6 cups of coffee. I woke up not too long ago and made myself a cup of coffee and went outside to have a cigarette with it. 

As soon as I lit up my cigarette and took a drag, I started feeling nauseated. My saliva got really thin (teary, watery, in excess) and I felt horribly uncomfortable. I thought I was going to throw up. So I put the cigarette out, went inside and headed to the sink. I spit out all the saliva in my mouth and gagged twice as though I was going to vomit. I didn't think I would vomit because I don't have any food in my system, but I gagged a third time and out came the 2 sips of coffee I've had. I gagged a few times after that but nothing came out.

Has anyone experienced this before? Any tips (for the present or future) or suggestions? I'd ideally not like to break my fast for at least another 6 hours.  I feel pretty okay right now. I haven't tried another cigarette but I'm drinking my coffee and feel fine. Since I feel okay, I should just continue fasting for the next few hours, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The last time I ate was yesterday on my trip at around 4pm east coast time, which is 1pm west coast time (where I live). It's just past 2pm right now. I'm thinking I'll break my fast tomorrow at around 1pm to make it a full 48 hour fast. This has been easy. I'm excited to keep fasting because I haven't fasted for more than 36 hours in years.

Usually, fasting after eating normally for a few days is really difficult for me. But today has been different. I decided to wear my "skinny shorts" since it's getting too hot to keep wearing skinny jeans. I expected them to be tight around my hips but they're actually really lose and hang off my hips! It's an amazing feeling. Usually they don't give me a loose, hanging off my hips feeling until I'm like 5 pounds lighter than I currently am. And considering I ate so much this weekend, it's even more of a surprise as to how nicely they fit. 

I'm not terribly hungry today. My mood has been pretty good as well. My last class of the day starts soon and I can't wait to get home to just drink coffee and relax. I'm also excited to try on more of my "skinny clothes" when I get home. This is such great motivation. 

I hope you're all having a lovely day xo </TEXT>

Yeah I drink protein shakes on occasion. I buy ON Gold Standard which is 120 calories per scoop. I mix it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk (30 calories) so that's 150 for a really filling and tasty shake. 

I use happy scale but I haven't logged my weight in a long time since I've had my mom visiting. 2 weekends ago she was here and I put on water weight, so I didn't weigh myself until Thursday. But then Friday to Sunday I was out of town and I've put on more water weight. So I'm fasting today (and maybe tomorrow) and restricting the rest of the week. I'll weigh myself Friday morning and log that weight.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know. I hate eating in front of strangers. I typically eat in my car if I have to eat on campus and even that is so frightening to me. I feel so exposed with the windows and everything lol. 

I'm the same way with protein bars! I recently started eating Quest bars but my go to are Balance bars. They are high in calories (190-210) but they are small, safe, nutrient dense and keep me full for at least 3 hours. I am an athlete and restriction has got me worried about losing my muscle mass so I eat the protein bars to ensure I can keep my muscle while losing fat. 

I made the decision to start seeing my therapist and psychiatrist, as well as starting group therapy again. I literally just texted my therapist. I think this will be a good outlet for me. 

I've considered maintaining especially so my mom doesn't think I'm engaging in ED behaviors and I'm losing weight "healthily" but the water weight thing with maintaining and just not seeing the scale drop is not something I'm ready for. 

Haha I remember you posting that! It's so cute. I almost want to send that to my therapist because that's what she sounds like when I tell her I haven't been eating.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I plan the same foods every day for a week, then the next week I try to switch it up. But with school, it gets tough. Sometimes I don't know if I'll come home for lunch or if I'll be on campus for lunch. I feel much more comfortable eating at home, even if I'm eating the same thing I'd bring to campus. I don't know. My ED brain is so fucked up. And then it's little things like "well if there's traffic then I'll have to wait an extra 30 minutes to eat" and it gives me so much anxiety. It's so stupid!!!!

Yeah I know whatever my doctors do it's because they are professionals, they know what they're doing and they care about me. Rationally, I should not resist their help. But at the same time, I'm not ready for help with my ED. I want to recover but I'll tell myself things like "oh when I get down to 100 pounds I'll recover" or something like that. 

And thank you! I'm here for you, too, if you ever want to talk 3 thank you for your support. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you weigh yourself every day? I'm not a binger but there will be days where I eat normally. If I don't weigh myself daily to see my progress, it makes it so much easier to want to eat a proper meal or something. I find that seeing every day that I'm losing weight helps me ignore those cravings because I know "If I eat that then the scale won't go down tomorrow like it did today." 

The only time I don't weigh myself is if I've eaten normally for a few days and I know the scale will be up when I stand on it. I fast and restrict for 3-5 days and then weigh myself so I'm not too horribly disappointed by the number.

E.g. I was out of town on a trip from Friday to Sunday and ate normally. I feel huge and I know the scale is up so I'm fasting today (and maybe tomorrow) then restricting all week. I won't weigh myself until Friday probably - or until I feel all the water weight is gone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same. Not bingeing but I was out of town with my mom and her boyfriend and we stayed in a hotel so I was eating out for like 2 meals a day. I'm fasting today and possibly tomorrow, too, to flush out the water weight. Then back to restricting indefinitely. So I know exactly how you feel.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even at my lowest weight I never had my period stop. However, even when I'd be at a weight in the healthy range, my period would be irregular as fuck because of restricting and fasting. Like, I would get my period as scheduled, then 2 weeks later I would get it again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I can see how fasting would do that. I mean, when I fast, I have less anxiety because I don't have to think about food. I just know I'm not eating that day. Restricting gives me a bit more anxiety because I'm constantly thinking about calories, when I'll eat next, what I'll eat, what will keep me full the longest with the least amount of calories, etc. 

My therapist and doctor will always talk to me about my eating, especially if they notice I've lost weight. And they'll always do the blind weigh ins. I mean, they can't force me to do anything as I am an adult, it's just talking about it is so draining. Again, they know my extensive history with anorexia so it's not something they'd be willing to ignore at all :/ I think I need to be honest with them and just deal with the consequences as they come.

	<TEXT> Yeah Lamictal made me have barely any appetite at all. There was a point where I lost 12 pounds over the course of 2 weeks. After the side effect wore off, I wanted to lose more weight so I intentionally restricted and almost 10 years later here I am, still with an eating disorder :|

I really do want to see my therapist or psychiatrist but I worry that the whole eating thing will be brought up and they'll tell me "well if you eat then you won't be as depressed." Like, I get that but even when I do eat normally, I still feel depressed. My eating disorder and depression are separate issues at this point (in my opinion) and I don't want them to lump it together. Plus they'll start doing regular blind weigh ins with me and I'm not mentally prepared for that. 

I just need to find it in me to pick between my ED and my depression. Both can't win, unfortunately.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No you're totally cool! I actually hadn't thought about considering a different medication. There was nothing terribly wrong with Prozac besides it made me feel like a zombie for the first 2 weeks, and I'd imagine most anti-depressants will make me feel that way. I used to also be on Lamictal for epilepsy and mood regulation, but that medication caused me to lose my appetite and trigger my anorexia in the first place so I'm doubtful she'll start me up on that again.  </TEXT>

Recovering has been lingering in the back of my mind. I absolutely hate my eating disorder and I wish I could just get rid of it.

	<TEXT> Sounds like your parents were in a deep deep denial. It's a blessing and a curse. On one hand, you're free to get as thin as you want. On the other hand, it kind of sucks that they don't *seem* to care enough that you're suffering. 

My mom is a doctor so unfortunately she's always on my ass when she thinks I'm getting too thin/engaging in ED habits. Even if my weight is in the healthy range but I've been restricting, she'll control my diet and every aspect of my life until I start eating normally and get up to a weight she's comfortable with me being at. I actually just made a post regarding this. On the upside, we live on opposite ends of the country so having to eat normally for one or two weekends isn't that bad in the grand scheme of things, when I only see her every 2-3 months. 

However, if I were to move back to Chicago, restriction would absolutely be out of the question. 

I have a therapist (psychologist) and a psychiatrist. My therapist specializes in eating disorders and knows my entire history with anorexia. But I prefer talking to her over my psychiatrist. Don't get me wrong, my psychiatrist is great, but she's just to...sterile in a way. My therapist has more empathy. I've been thinking about making an appointment with my therapist but then she'll notice I've lost weight and it'll be this huge thing. If I see my psychiatrist, she'll probably put me back on Prozac and I really don't want to be on any meds right now. 

I really appreciate and am so grateful for your support. I'm really happy you sought treatment for your depression!  </TEXT>

Even before I developed my ED, when I was 12/13 I had a heart murmur and some epileptic episodes which caused me to faint a lot. After the cardiac arrest episode it took me 6 months to get cleared for any physical activity. Even now, I experience really bad tachycardia with exercise, and even being at rest. Sometimes when I do cardio my heart rate will get up to 195. Sometimes my resting heart rate is 100. It only gets worse with restriction/fasting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went into cardiac arrest when I was 18 during a really really bad relapse. I had been restricting fairly consistently for a while then I went 4 days fasting with water, tea, coffee and diet coke. I wasn't hydrated enough despite only consuming liquids and I went on a 5 mile run to meet my mom at her hospital (where she worked) because she wanted us to go to Costco after work. I remembered feeling dizzy, barely being able to breathe and when I did breathe, it hurt my chest. Then I woke up on a stretcher. Thank the fucking Lord this happened at a hospital and my mom is a doctor because if not I probably would have died or had some really awful permanent heart damage.

	<TEXT> Note: I didn't tell her about anything ED related. That would be a whole different issue.

So I've been on a trip with my mom and her boyfriend this weekend. I've been really depressed for the past few months (which is what probably triggered my ED relapse) and it's been hard holding it all in. My flight was earlier this morning, and as I was saying bye to my mom, I just started crying and saying how lonely and sad I am, how I feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life. 

She suggested I move back to Chicago (our hometown/where she lives) so I'm around her/family. She said she'll visit me (I live in Vegas) every month until I move so I'm not lonely. 

I honestly don't have it in me to apply to a different college, find an apartment, find a new barn for my horse, find a shipper for my horse, etc. Literally all I want to do is lay in bed all day and cry and sleep and pet my cats. That's it. 

I like when my mom visits me but the ED part *hates* it because when she's here, I eat. And my progress stalls. And the number on the scale doesn't go down. And my clothes feel tighter. And I feel fucking disgusting. That's honestly the biggest thing that's bothering me right now. That if she visits, I won't lose weight. And it's so fucking stupid that I would rather be thin and miserable than happy with my mother's love (and bomb ass food).

I don't really have a reason for posting this here.  I just need to vent and I'm absolutely miserable. I'm at the airport waiting to get on my flight back to Vegas, and when I get back to Vegas, I'll just be lonely and miserable and starved. I hate this. I really just can't wait to get back home so I can cry myself to sleep. </TEXT>

Take this however you want, but I don't believe in changing myself for someone else. I'm starving myself to look pretty and thin, but that's for ME and no one else. Don't give your SO that kind of power.

	<TEXT> Aw I'm so sorry your ED has made your birthday an unpleasant experience for you! Just try to focus on whatever activities you're doing (i.e. the movie and spending time with your friends). For the pizza, maybe just have 1 or 2 slices and pack the rest for home? Offer it to your parents/family when you get home if you really think you're not going to eat it. Since it's a build-your-own type place, maybe put toppings on it that you don't enjoy so you're not tempted to eat much of it. Regarding the cheesecake, just cut yourself a tiny piece and have a few bites and just spend a lot of time talking to your friends and stuff. But really, try to enjoy your birthday as much as you can!!! Happy birthday, by the way!

My goal for the end of April is a very reasonable goal of being 115. The past 2 weekends have been very social (mom and her boyfriend visited last weekend and this weekend I'm on a trip with them). There is no scale in my hotel room but I'd imagine with water weight and everything I'm 124ish. I'll be home tomorrow night, so with fasting and restriction starting on Monday, I'd imagine I'd be back down to 119 by next Sunday, so 115 is definitely a reasonable goal to set myself for the end of the month. I don't have any other social activities planned for April so there's nothing to get in my way of restriction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I just fast for one day (maybe two days depending on how much damage has been done) and go back to restricting. Last weekend my mom and her boyfriend were in town so I ate more and put on a few pounds of mostly water weight, so after they left, I fasted the first day and restricted the rest of the week. 

This weekend, I'm out of town with my mom and her boyfriend (April has been a rough month ugh) so when I'm back at home, I'm going to fast on Monday, and maybe Tuesday if I don't feel better after my Monday fast, then go back to restricting. 

I just try to remind myself how happy I get when I see the scale go down, how nice it is to feel my bones so prominently before I go to bed and when wake up in the morning and how nice it feels to have my clothes be baggy on me. Even though I've had a set back, there's no reason I can't get back to where I used to be. </TEXT>

If starvation mode is real then why the fuck did I become skeletal from anorexia when I was a teenager and how did I maintain that skeletal physique until I was eating a *surplus* of calories? You're not automatically going to gain weight if you eat at maintenance. Even if you eat above maintenance by a few hundred calories you're not going to balloon up overnight. Well, temporarily you might but you get my point. 

[insert Kermit drinking tea meme] I ate more than usual this weekend and last weekend and I didn't gain back the 15 pounds I lost in the past month, but that's none of my business.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So my one best friend knows about my recent ED relapse. She and I were talking on the phone last night because I was having some issues with my ex girlfriend. My friend started saying "you know I'm sure the break up is part of the reason why you're having this relapse." 

Now, this friend of mine is pretty significantly overweight. She's 1-2 inches taller than me and probably 25-30 pounds heavier than me.  She went on to say something like this: 

"I really hate that you have this eating disorder. Especially nutrition wise, you know, your body goes into starvation mode and as soon as you start eating ANYTHING, whether it's fruits or vegetables even, you'll gain back ALL the weight REALLY rapidly and it's just horrible for you. Trust me, when I was working, I didn't have time to eat all day then I'd come home and eat dinner and I just started rapidly gaining weight and getting heavier. You need to eat every 2 hours, something that's around 250 calories, if you want to be healthy." 250 calories every 2 hours? If I'm awake for 16 hours a day, that's 2000 calories which is 200 calories above my TDEE = weight gain!

:O ---- that was my face when she was saying all of that. 

I wanted to tell her "you know, starvation mode is a myth." But she's the type of person who it's really hard to persuade her even with facts. But omg she is so clueless! Even if I restrict for several days, then one day I have 1500 calories (which is under my TDEE), yes, I'll "gain" weight in the morning, but the number on the scale is water + poo weight.

We both ride horses together and she said "Don't let the pressure of the riding world get to you. You're not fat. You look perfect and [insert our trainer's name here] thinks you're the perfect size for a rider, nothing is wrong with your body."

!!!!!

My ED has very little to do with looking good for riding! Sure, I want to look hot as fuck in tight breeches and sometimes I (irrationally) think to myself "oh well if I was lighter I'd be easier on my horse's back" when in reality my horse has no problem carrying me around. 

Anyways, it just pissed me off so much that she brought up "starvation mode" and blamed my relapse on riding. My ED is 70% about control, compulsion and obsession. Not about how I look on my horse.

	<TEXT> Okay wow sorry I'm 2 hours late to the party but: 

So I quit cigarette smoking on January 1st 2015. I switched to vaping. I started at 18mg nicotine and worked my way down to 0mg as of March 2016. 

I'm like 99% sure that quitting cigarettes is what caused my weight gain last year. I remember, in April/May/June of last year, I was eating all sorts of CRAP that I hadn't eaten in years (e.g. fast food, doughnuts, cake). I was also depressed from a break up and food tasted much better since I quit smoking, so I was eating so much more of all these unhealthy foods. 

Anyways, since I relapsed in the last month, I've started smoking cigarettes again. They don't suppress my appetite or anything, it's more like an emotional connection I get with cigarettes. Cigarette + coffee is heaven. 

I haven't become addicted to them again. My mom and her boyfriend visited for 4 days last week so I couldn't smoke, but I didn't have nicotine withdrawals or irritability despite smoking 5-8 cigarettes per day for 2 weeks before their visit. 

Also, since i started smoking again, I switched my vape liquids to 3mg nicotine so it's easier to ween off the cigarettes incase I was starting to get withdrawal symptoms. 

Usually I smoke Marlboro menthols but this week I switched to reds and I'm going back to menthols next week. 

Vaping is really great though because I vape dessert flavors and I pretty much never crave sweets.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OMG I actually just bought a second pair and I'm kinda bummed about it because they were $203 and in a month they're not going to fit me anymore. I wear my TS for showing and I don't plan on showing until the fall so it's really such a waste.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My one friend had an ED so she flat out tells me "that's a lie" if I say "I'm not hungry/I already ate/I'll eat later." 

My other friend knows about my ED and it just becomes this huge thing if I don't eat while we're together because she knows I don't eat much when I'm alone. Even if I could chose a lower calorie food option with this friend, I really don't feel comfortable eating with her. This is going to sound HORRIBLE but this friend is very overweight, so when I eat with her, I feel like I'm looking at a reflection of what I'll look like after eating whatever it is I'm eating. I know that sounds really really awful but it's just how I feel.

Unfortunately, the only time I feel semi comfortable eating with people is when I'm with my family, but my family lives on the other side of the country :| </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love museums! My mom's boyfriend really wants to go to the Smithsonian which I'm excited about. I went to London for 2 weeks in 2014 and I went to a different museum every day. It was awesome.  I was slightly eating disordered back then and basically I just ate 1 meal a day during that trip (plus a granola bar in the morning). When I came home, I was up 3 pounds. After a few days of restriction I got back down to the weight I was at before my trip. I think if I do something similar, I'll be okay. 

My only issue with this trip (compared to London) is I'll be doing stuff with other people, meaning if they want to eat, I have to as well. When I was in London, my mom was there doing business stuff all day so I only saw her at night (for dinner). But hopefully it all goes well. I'm technically only there for 1 *full* day so I can't imagine it'll be that awful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not so great. I was aiming for 110 by the end of the month but it doesn't look plausible. Despite fasting and restricting after my mom's visit, I'm still up 1.4 pounds. And this weekend I'm going out of town with her, so that'll set me back even further. I think I'm going to reset my goal to be 115 by the end of the month, which is more than doable. Realistically I'll probably end up at 112 by May 2nd.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you deal with the guilt that comes with having an eating disorder? My mom was here over the weekend and cooked all these delicious foods for me. I froze all the food as individual meals. I lied to her all week saying "oh yeah I'm soooo full from the potato curry you made me" or if she'd ask if I had eaten yet today I would say "no I haven't had time, busy day at school, but I'm planning on eating that chicken curry as soon as I get home". 

Besides food guilt, what about guilt socially? I avoid hanging out with my friends because majority of the time when I see my friends, it involves food. I miss my friends and I hate that they think I'm being cold or distant. It's just that my ED won't let me see them . I mentioned in a previous post that my barn is going to dinner at Olive Garden later this month. I really want to go to the dinner to get to know the people at my barn better, but my ED brain won't let me go since it's food related. The people at the barn already think I'm unfriendly, so this would have been a great opportunity to prove myself otherwise.

My one best friend is someone I met in ED group therapy. She's recovered now, and she knows about my recent relapse. Since she knows I'm struggling lately, almost every night she asks "Do you want to come over? I'm cooking dinner. Maybe eating together will make you feel better." I really really appreciate her trying to help me and I feel bad for refusing. Especially since she had an ED, I'm scared my relapse is a trigger to her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's what I'm thinking. I actually wear ankle socks with my tall boots haha. I find boot socks to be super super uncomfortable. It'll take me at least until September to save up for new tall boots so I'll definitely have to start wearing boot socks and double up on them until then.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * Fasting after eating a lot/normally for several days is really fucking hard! My mom and her boyfriend visited from Thursday-Sunday and I ate when they ate. Smaller quantities than what they ate, but still, WAY more than I typically eat. I fasted on Monday to try and flush it all out in a way and let me tell you, fasting is so much easier when you've been restricting for 2-3 days beforehand. Monday was a rough day.

* My tall boots (riding boots) have gotten really loose on me! I mean, they're supposed to be skin tight. When they properly fit, I can barely fit my finger in between the boot and my leg. But now I can stick my hand all the way to the bottom of my knuckles down my boots. I think I might need new boots o.O???

* I'm going to Washington DC Friday-Sunday with my mom and her boyfriend. UGH. It'll just undo all the progress I've made this week, making up for all the food I ate over the weekend! On the bright side, my flight gets in Friday afternoon, so I'll only really have to eat dinner. I'll be there all day Saturday, however, I have my own hotel room so I really will only have to eat dinner with them unless they make plans including me during the day. Maybe I'll just tell them I still have homework to do. On Sunday my flight is in the morning so I could probably fast all day if I really wanted to...

* My ankles have gotten really bony and it's kind of uncomfortable when I sleep on my side :|

* I've said it before and I'll say it again - school sucks the life out of me. Who knew using your brain took so much energy out of you (sarcasm). Seriously, school makes me so ravenous. I just drink coffee when I get hungry but it's miserable. Sigh. 4 weeks until finals! 4 weeks until I can just wake up, drink coffee, ride my horse then stay home all day drinking more coffee!

And with that, good night friends! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just tried a Quest bar yesterday and the one bar took me an hour to eat. They are high in fibre so they only have 4 *net* carbs. Their consistency is tough so I need to chew for a while and have lots of water in between bites of it. They are 190 calories per bar but they are super filling and this week I'm making a single Quest bar be my "dinner". I was on this sub while eating it so I would take a bite, chew for a while, have a few sips of water, and before I knew it, 10-15 minutes had passed. That's why it took me an hour to eat it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If there are posts/comments that make us uncomfortable, can we just link you to the post/comment in a message instead of a report? Sometimes the post/comment that makes me uncomfortable isn't blatantly against the rules or anything, so I would feel the need to explain it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sorry you failed your exam :(

Not exactly what you're talking about, but whenever *anything* goes badly for me, I think to myself "if I were skinnier this wouldn't have happened". Even if what happened has absolutely nothing to do with weight/appearance/etc. It's totally irrational and stupid but that's my ED brain :| </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use them to replace meals and I actually quite like them! They are REALLY filling and tough in texture so it takes a while to finish chewing and swallowing one bite. What I did last night, was eat the bar over the course of one hour (1 bite every 10 or so minutes). I'm trying the cookies and cream bar for "dinner" tonight.  </TEXT>
