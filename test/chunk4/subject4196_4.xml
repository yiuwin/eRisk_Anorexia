Paper is a sketchbook from a Swedish office supplies thingy so if you dont live in Sweden you cant get your hands on it. I have relatives sending me sketchbooks when I run out as I cant buy them in Japan.
For colors I use copics and color pencils. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes they are expensive indeed but they have pretty much every color there is and I got an art shop close by that have all of them so I just go there and pick whatever I need and by now I got a very wide range of colors that fits me perfectly. I would recommend that you give them another try because they are incredible to use. The big downer is that they run dry really fast if you draw a lot.  </TEXT>
