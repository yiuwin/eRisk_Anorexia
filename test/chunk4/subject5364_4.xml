	<TEXT> I was a new bus person, sat at the back with my friend. A gentleman in a long black coat got on and sat at the back as well. Eventually he started making clicking sounds with his mouth and would look at us. Like waiting for us to respond. He did this the whole time until we got off. I wonder what would have happened if we clicked back. or just talked to the guy. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's harder for a man but other women and media are more focused on beauty. For example if a man has some chub goin on he has man boobs, but if a woman with the same weight gain she would be considered curvy and velopsuous. You also never hear about male plus size models.   </TEXT>
