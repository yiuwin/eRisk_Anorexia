	<TEXT> I've lost about 100 lbs, and I lost it relatively quick. As a result, I have god awful loose skin that is driving me nuts. Mainly on my stomach, the other areas seem to be tightening up. Part of the stomach issue may also be that I've had a major surgery (a huge uterine tumor/hysterectomy) and from what I've read, once those muscles have been cut, it's hard to get them back to normal...if possible at all. So not only do I have the loose skin issue, but no matter how many crunches and stuff I do, I still have a stomach bulge made of flimsy muscle and loose skin. 

I've been taking collagen supplements, using bio oil and Skintight firming lotion on the area, exfoliating the area, and trying to stay plenty hydrated in an effort to firm things up, but it's still my biggest problem area and it's making me sad. I've lost so much weight and still can't wear a bathing suit or cute tops. :(

Does anyone have any tips as to how I can firm things up more? Surgery to have the skin removed isn't really an option at the moment. 

Also, I'm old lol. So I mean, things don't bounce back the way they did when I was in my 20's. Sob.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finally found a place that carries Halo Top in my city, so tomorrow I'm going to go grab a few pints to have on hand for when the ice cream cravings kick in. I really hope they have the lemon cake and birthday cake flavors, but if not, I'm sure I can be happy with one of the others. I'm super excited to try it! Ice cream that won't kick me out of ketosis, and won't make me feel like jumping off a bridge after I eat it is a dream come true!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I second the stomach bug excuse. I use it often when I'm trying to get out of eating in front of people. 

"Everything really looks great but I've had a bit of a stomach virus or something this week and I am still a bit queasy. I'm afraid if I eat anything right now I won't be able to keep it down and I don't want to hurl on anyone!" 

And bring a ginger ale with you for emphasis.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What a dick! 

My guess is Tom got shot down by someone he hit on earlier in the evening and needed to take back a little pride by stripping someone else of thiers.  It doesn't excuse what a horrible thing he did, but try not to let it keep you down. This is totally ALL about what a worthless, cruel shit of a person HE is, and nothing to do with you personally. 

As for the drunk friends who didn't have your back, alcohol makes us all stupid at times. I'd talk to them about it when they're sober and tell them it really hurt your feelings that someone belittled you in front of them and no one had your back. 

I'm sorry you went through this. People just suck sometimes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, yes. 

I spend entirely too long in grocery stores reading labels, making decisions, and pretending I'm not going to end up wasting half of the shit I buy. Or eating it all at once if a binge happens. Or, fantasizing about being able to eat it all while being a stick figure person who has an amazing metabolism and never gains an ounce. Meh.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally this! I have horrible anxiety, and focusing on my restricting/reciting calories of safe foods and stuff like that totally helps keep my brain busy and off of other things most of the time.

But then there are times when the anxiety is 100% ED related and that is a special kind of hell. To fret for two hours over whether I should eat a fucking egg and give in to my hunger, even though it will put me at 10 calories over my acceptable limit for the day *omg you worthless shit, how dare you give in* and then fret for two more hours about how I couldn't resist a fucking egg until I either dissolve into a puddle of shame and say "fuck it, you've ruined everything may as well eat this gallon of ice cream and 14 Quest bars, fat ass" or I get a new found resolve and don't cave again for weeks. 

Ugh lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I need to get my head back in the right mindset. I've been lenient since hitting 90 lbs and now I'm not 90 lbs anymore. I hope most of it is water weight, but I feel gross and huge now so who knows. *sobs*

I thought I could have a day here and there where I relaxed my restricting, but it always ends up in a multiple day binge, so no more. Starting back tomorrow, it's heavy restricting and/or fasting and NO cheat days. I'm too much of a weak sack of shit to stop myself at "just a little taste" of ice cream or sweets, so I'm not going to allow myself any at all. I suck at moderation. 

I need a willpower coach. Or a food activated shock collar that activates every time I touch food lol. At least for a few days til I have my resolve back. Ugh.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get horrible cramps and pains in my calves, especially when fasting or restricting low for extended periods along with running or being super active. Seems to be fairly common with low carb/keto diets. My fix has been taking a magnesium/calcium/potassium/vitamin d/boron supplement once a day (I can message you a link to the exact supplement if you'd like) and, as odd as it sounds, pickle juice. I swear the pickle juice is a godsend. I also use pink salt, even in my water. If you eat low carb enough to be in ketosis, your sodium requirements change.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've only ever really told one person the true extent of my ED, and his reaction was mostly anger and then he tried to help me. But it turned to anger again and we don't talk anymore so "I'm on my own." Which I'm fine with. I did sort of try to do better for him but I have no one in my life who gives a fuck anymore so I can live or die as I please. 

Well gee, that came out morbid lol. But really, it's a relief. I felt guilty lying about eating/not eating when he asked and I hated being held accountable and told to get help. Now I don't have to because literally no one cares now and it is a comforting sense of freedom.

	<TEXT> I'm currently in this same stupid struggle myself. I *know* I will still lose weight if I increase my calories to 1,000 or even 1,200...*and* I will probably end up feeling better physically as well as reducing the potential for binging. And I start off every day planning to do that but by the end of the day, I've cut something out here or skipped something there and I'm beating myself up if I go over 600 calories. We are our own worst enemies sometimes. 

Good luck! If you figure out a way to successfully convince yourself, please let me in on it! 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think for me, it becomes an emotional thing. Darkness, being alone without the distractions of the day, and being tired always brings my depression/self-loathing and anxiety to the surface, and eating was something I did for comfort once upon a time. I think, subconsciously, my brain is sending me signals that food will make me feel better? I fight it most times by telling myself, out loud and repeatedly if I have to, that *no*, it will *not* make me feel better. 

I try to put myself in a decent state of mind before I eat dinner, so I am not trying to feed my emotions instead of my actual hunger. It doesn't always work, but I try. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After being on a "eating my feelings" kick for the past three days, I am so ready to start a new week fresh tomorrow. I am terrified of stepping on the scale tomorrow. 

I usually follow a keto diet (except super restrictive) but I ate so much sugary crap the past few days because I was depressed and exhausted and just didn't have the energy to fight the temptation. And now I physically and mentally feel like garbage for eating that shit. So it's back to keto and restricting and exercising tomorrow. I didn't work this hard to lose this much weight to gain it all back because I have no self control. 
 
Sorry, that came out super ranty instead of inspired lol. I'm irritated with myself but I appreciate the motivation of your post! Good luck to everyone with whatever their goals are this week! 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to fast quite easily, but it's gotten harder lately. I think because I used to have tons of fat reserves to burn, like a hibernating bear lol. The more weight I've lost, it seems like the more I need to eat to keep me going...which SUCKS. 

I've had to increase my calories yet again because of dizzy spells and headaches, and just having no energy. I think I'd pass out constantly if I tried fasting now. (Stupid body, just do what *I* want you to do and not what you think *you* want to do.....) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently my reward for finally reaching 90 lbs was to eat the entire kitchen this weekend. Ugh. 

But, my reward for whenever I hit a weight I'm comfortable at (so....never?) is to finally start getting the tattoos I've been wanting forever but couldn't get because fat. 

As far as smaller weight goals, I didn't really reward myself. Just seeing those numbers drop on the scale was reward enough. How about stuff like a nice shampoo? New makeups? Bath bombs...etc. Small things that make you happy and feel pretty?  </TEXT>

Same with my arms, legs and neck. I have recently started taking collagen, using Nuskin and Bio-Oil, and just hoping for the best. I haven't talked about having it surgically removed, mainly because I'm hoping that over time, it will firm up.

	<TEXT> I'm getting to a weight/size where people are starting to nag me about losing "too much" so I decided to let myself have a free day once every week or two where I eat whatever I want and *try* not to obsess/stress/cry about it. I try to make that day happen whenever I'm going to be around people so they can see me "be normal."

I went to the Renaissance Festival yesterday with friends, so yesterday was that cheat day. Holy hell, I pigged out. Ended up getting a ton of stuff, but none of it tasted all that good so I ate a little of everything and tossed the rest. Until I discovered the caramel apple stand. Luckily, I got the last plain one (I don't like nuts or chocolate all that much) so I wasn't tempted to go back for more. It was amazing. When I got home, I was super exhausted, which always triggers me to mindlessly eat...so I ate an entire container of Skippy PB Pretzel bites, ice cream, beef jerky and....half my kitchen. 

Today is back to normal. And I'm still trying not to sweat yesterday. One day every week or two won't screw me up too badly, and will hopefully keep binge-urges at bay while fasting/restricting the rest of the week. 

Don't be too hard on yourself! </TEXT>
