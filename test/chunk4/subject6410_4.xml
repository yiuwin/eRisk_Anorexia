	<TEXT> I dont think it was a coincidence that Lor San Tekka was located on Jakku. Out of all the other planets he could have retired to with his hippy community, he does so on some junk wasteland. He must've known about Rey and her special powers and decided to protect her </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In some web service functions, i found that not closing sql cursors helped reduce the memory retained in the w3wp process. So ive gotten some improvements.

but as a general rule, is it safe to say that all memory that is allocated to w3wp process after executing the ws call should then be released if all resources are then disposed of? or does some minor fingerprint still remain regardless? </TEXT>

<WRITING>
	<TITLE> Why does the w3wp process uses high amounts of private and virtual memory and seldomly releases it? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Im currently running some asmx web services on a Windows Server 2008 machine with IIS.

The asmx web services accept some XML data, connect to a database and return response XML

I have found that if i repeatedly call these web services, the w3wp process in task manager steadily grows its private and virtual memory amounts. Eventually, the memory amounts will grow to anywhere between 500mb and 1gb and then throw "protected memory" exceptions.

Aside from setting app-pool recycle limits, how can i prevent the process from reaching such high levels and then crash?

	<TEXT> I am an Aussie considering travel to Jordan with my girlfriend in July this year. primarily to visit Petra. While this is all well and good, i want to consider all possible risks of travelling there before i make a final decision. So if there are any redditors here who have travelled to Jordan to see Petra, what advice would you give to someone to ensure their maximum safety and enjoyment? (i have read info on smarttraveller.gov.au, im just looking for personal accounts to supplement this).

Thanks in advance </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would like to point out one thing i think is also relevant

[Lor San Tekka](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lor_San_Tekka) who is a member of the Church of the Force is situated in the village of Tuanul on Jakku. Why is Lor San Tekka there? You would think that he and the villagers (who apparently are also members of the Church), would be hidden in some more convenient location like the New Republic or in some ancient Jedi location. But for some reason happen to be on Jakku.

I dont think this is a coincidence. I think a more plausible explanation is that they are there on Jakku, either looking for Rey because they havent found her yet, or they have found her, but leave her do her thing, "until the time came" to approach her.

See here is where i see another parallel between Rey and Luke.  Lor San Tekka is to Rey what Obi-Wan was to Luke. Although in TFA, Lor San Tekka never survived to approach Rey. 

Furthermore, Lor's residence on Jakku was no secret as Poe from the Resistance was able to find him. So hiding away from galactic society is not necessarily the best explanation for his presence on Jakku

	<TITLE> [general discussion] Would you like the idea of seeing "other" Imperial remnant factions in VIII? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-11 03:58:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'd imagine that the First Order was not the only successor to the Galactic Empire. Perhaps in VIII we could see another rivaling faction take them on in some massive space battle? 
I reckon this is totally possible.. perhaps this other remnant is just not as powerful until TFA, but then makes some huge advance and gains a lot of power. And perhaps the Resistance allies itself to them?

What do you reckon? would you like the idea of seeing another Imperial remnant in the mix?

EDIT: in fact, i'd like to see some kind of meeting between various remnant leaders where they decide the future of the Empire or something along those lines. In the prequels we had the senate of good guys.. how about a meeting of bad guys in the sequels </TEXT>
