	<TEXT> Hey there, I consistently see posts of amazing gardens   harvests.  I buy from farmer's markets BUT I know that my sister in law is part of a crop share that produces WAY too much for her to ever consume or even give away!  Is anyone else the same way?  I was hoping to start a thread where willing gardeners might write where they're located, (I'm interested in Denver-area!) and if they have any extra they'd be willing to sell.  Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Camping weekend, you're invited! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-05 21:27:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There was talk of a redditor camping weekend.  While this is not exclusively redditors, I have a few friends flying in for the [meteor shower](http://stardate.org/nightsky/meteors) that is supposed to peak on Tuesday, that I would like to invite you all to if you are interested.

What? Meteor shower and tubing/float trip


Where? Likely around the State Bridge/Vail area, roughly a 2 hour drive from Denver.


Who? Hubs and I, along with 3 friends from college (all chill dudes that I trust with my life), and probably another Denverite or two.  **Your friends are welcome, whether they are redditors or not.  I feel like this should go without saying, but, ya know.**  


When? Leaving Friday night. I have some pals taking off from the airport on Sunday, one Monday, and I plan on staying til Wednesday. So there are outs if you need it.


Why? Meteor showers are fucking amazing. We went last year and went on a long float up to state bridge and then stayed up and the amount of shooting stars was Disney-like.  One of my coolest weekends in Denver, hands down.


**But I don't have camping gear, what now?**  We have a substantial amount of gear and are happy to share what we can spare.  This means cooking supplies/lanterns/etc.  Last year, some of us slept on blankets under the stars!  Right now, tents are on sale at [Big 5](http://www.big5sportinggoods.com/) as well as tubes.  I would recommend the [River Run](http://www.big5sportinggoods.com/product/river-inflatables/478242-154970/intex-river-run-float.html), pretty deluxe, headrest, cup holders, mesh bottom, $20 in store right now, or the [River Rat](http://www.big5sportinggoods.com/product/river-inflatables/478242-154964/intex-47-river-rat-tube.html) which is going for $7.50 as of last week.  PM me with questions.  


Whether any of you join or not, I will be going, just wanted to extend the invite to any of you that wanted to go camping and are ready for a baller weekend.  There will be plenty of boozing and smerking as well, if that's your style.


Edit: We can show up at Wynkoop Thursday night if anyone wants to meet us before going, to confirm that we're not rapists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check out "the Spanish apartment." Basically watching movies with subtitles helps so much. It feels like you aren't learning because you're reading the whole time, but it's good to hear words and sounds again and again.  Especially if you watch movies you already know. I used to watch Pixar movies in German without subtitles and since I knew the gist of it, I could pick up new words. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Request] Suggestions for learning Polish </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-23 18:22:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all, I have a good friend who speaks Polish and I'm going to try to learn it, especially if I travel there again.  I've studied German, French, and Spanish, and I've found these books INCREDIBLY useful, and I was wondering if anyone had a suggestion for something similar.  

[here](http://www.amazon.com/French-Grammar-Drills-Series/dp/0071475133) and [here](http://www.amazon.com/German-Drills-Fourth-Edition-Series/dp/0071744711)

These books were perfect because there was a Grammar Drill book and a Verb Drill book for each language, at a great price, around $10/book.  I realize Polish isn't as common a language, but I didn't expect the $40/ea price I've been finding on Amazon.  The reason I want to stick to a workbook is, despite there being tons of free exercises online, workbooks help keep me in line.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all,

Got tickets for 2, looking for a 3rd for our friend flying in from out of town.  I *had* a friend promise that she had a ticket waiting (at face value) and then completely bailed because she wanted to go to the show (can't blame her, still peeved) ....luckily I hadn't told the friend-coming-in-town about the surprise yet.  ANYWAY, it would be incredible to have him be able to go to the show and see Red Rocks and a couple of our favorite artists.  I'd so much rather give my $ to a redditor than to stubhub.

TL; DR, Trying to be a GGG but life is getting in the way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. The italians have this stuff called "rocket sauce" using arugula, heavy whipping cream, and cream cheese......it's fucking fantastic.  I'm having a bit of trouble finding a recipe, but I added spinach.  Was very generous with the amount of leaves and minimal with the cream cheese and the whipping cream...I would suggest blending the leaves and then adding a teeny bit of whipping cream and then adding cream cheese to taste. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Currently in WAKA but joining either Go! Kickball or KIFAC in the future.  The people were amazing but for the most part (aside from 1 or 2 events like this ALL SEASON), the league was shit.  $73 for 4 Thursdays of kickball (one was a triple header, weather resched), they were always demanding volunteers to ref...I don't know where the money was put into besides the end of season party and the guy running the stuff (hopefully at least he got a take from it, and it didn't just go to corporate, he's a decent guy).  

That being said, I'm also in a bunch of other sports, so if you're athletic, hit me up when you get in town and I'll set ya up with some of my teams.  Great way to meet people   be active!  Also, all the coed sports seem to be dying to have girls in good ol' Menver. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed.  I don't know if it was just speculation, but I read somewhere that Etsy is going to separate into Etsy-handmade and Etsy-corporate for resales.  For me, Etsy as a venue is starting to fade as well.  Amazon has been where it's at lately.  What kind of products do you sell? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I found a caterer for my wedding, they had never done a wedding before.  My fiance and I went in after asking if they'd be open to the idea of serving 200 people.  Sampled a bunch of their different dishes, ended up going with a price somewhere around what was on the menu, around $12/13 a plate with servers included (they kept a couple of their employees around for $25/hr for the 2 hours they worked, ended up serving cake, too).  We had great choices, and that price included salad, bread, a few different meat choices, asparagus, potatoes, a whole slew of stuff.  Family style.  Ask restaurants you like if they'd be open to the idea.  Some aren't, but I only went to maybe 2 or 3 places before we found one that was reasonably priced and delicious. </TEXT>
