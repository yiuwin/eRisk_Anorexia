	<TEXT> Nah that's just me speculating what they'll do. It comes from all the times I've seen stupid AMAs with lawyers and their dumb cases. The one that comes to mind is the lawyer who was gonna sue the creators of No Man's Sky for false advertising.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the story where he tells how they would sometimes change up the cue cards to try and make him laugh. If I'm not mistaken, John Mulaney was the one working on this character with him. I love when Hader breaks.

Stopped being lazy and looked the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWv7x5mJMA4) up where he talks about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm hoping we get to see something similar if t_d is ever shut down. I can't wait to read about how Reddit is finished and Donald is gonna shut it down and now everyone is going to Voat. 

Or how Reddit is going to be sued by the collective t_d users. There will be an AMA from a lawyer somewhere saying they're filing papers against Reddit.

God damn I can't wait.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. Im so distressed right now I dont know what to do. I didnt mean to do that to my mom but Im literally in shock from the this admin announcement. I feel like Im going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he replacing comments? This cant be happening. Im having a fucking breakdown. I dont want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Spez to be a nice young lad and a fine example to us all. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasnt supposed to be like this, I thought he really cared because Reddit must be run as a an altruistic website where everyone wins and there's no banning free speech????

	<TEXT>  DMs aren't (usually) pushy just to be dicks. They're trying to wrangle multiple people's dreams into an arena where none outshine anyone else's, including their own. It's a damn hard job, especially when players don't realize they're actually just as responsible for making sure everyone has fun. It's easy to see that as Fun Police from a player's perspective, but all it takes is one selfish player (even unknowingly) to make you wish for a DM that would just tell that asshole "No".

I just wanted to say that this is a great explanation for one of the biggest barriers/hurdles DMs face. Absolutely spot on imo.  </TEXT>

A letter Dr. King wrote while in a Birmingham jail. [Here](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) it is. 

Here is the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_from_Birmingham_Jail) article on it for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love how people here are just dismissing it because they've never heard of him. A bit of ethnocentrism going on here.

Yep, that sounds about right. It's even shown in the next comment:

i'm sure will smith is more famous

I'm really wondering if this main character has anything to do with Rey (such as being her mother).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I have several movies and shows that I'll watch over and over, without even really paying attention. It's just a familiar presence that's comforting.

I absolutely do this. I'll listen to the same music or watch the same YouTube videos that I enjoy over and over for months. I find it's incredibly comforting and helpful with my depression and anxiety. 

This is a great answer to OPs question.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Or the dragon could hire them for more job it deems itself unworthy of. Having a dragon as an employer can open up tons of interesting story lines.

The mind flayer could be a rogue one, so it's splitting away from the other ones. Or maybe more flayers will want revenge when the party kills it.

That's why I love stories like this. OP could use only one aspect, say the dragon, and turn it into a whole new thing or expand upon what's already happening. I prefer the former and starting fresh occasionally with small connections to the past, but that's just my personal preference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was a solid reply and I see your point now! Fair enough. 

I have to be honest though, I really just hope the movie is good in general. With DC's track record so far, the little things are bothering me less and less in exchange for what I'm hoping just ends up as a good movie all around.  </TEXT>

Also if we really consider it, he kind of did that for Hulkbuster. So what if he has it set up so like a repulsor breaks, then maybe a new one could fly out to him? He has never done this, and I maintain it's to look cool, but I guess it's a possibility.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to visit where he lived (we live in a different state) for some reason or another, and ended up hooking with two of our female friends while we were all drunk together. My fiance, who was in another state, knew about it so it was kosher.

But the next morning I had this huge hickie on my neck and he noticed it as he was taking me to the airport. I played it off and he just sat there thinking for the most part. I think he didn't know how to respond and I was totally unaware of how to handle it. My fiance was a sweetheart and handled it by calling him later and just telling him she knew how I got it and it was fine.

He has never mentioned it since and has been a great future father in law, but I imagine he has a few more pieces of our sex life than he would have liked lol.  </TEXT>

Yet they're all pretty vanilla, so we usually get tons of questions or if we talk about hitting on a girl they're actually helpful. It's been pretty awesome. </TEXT>
