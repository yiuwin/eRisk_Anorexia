	<TEXT> I reached out a guy I found via a gun website of sorts. Here is his feedback:

"Interesting piece.

It looks like it uses a lot of parts from an 1809 Prussian, but it also looks like it was restocked here in America.

The bands, shape of the stock and the engraved nosecap don't seem to be from an 1809.

Building new muskets out of old military guns was a typical New England practice."

*I then asked him if he thought it was in the Civil War and he said:*

"An 1809 found in the US was most likely a CW gun. They converted a lot of them to caplocks.

Look for numbers stamped/engraved on the buttplate and barrel. There will probably be a date on the barrel from when it was converted.

At the end of the war, the soldiers were able to buy their muskets, bayonets and cartridge boxes from the government for $15. It was a way for the government to raise money, to unload all of those used guns and to give the men a prize to bring home.

The gun was probably one of those, that was later fixed up either by it's owner or a descendant.

Look into it and see if you had an ancestor in that house who was in the Civil War."

	<TEXT> I just googled that - you are right. It really does look like that type of gun. Now I just have to figure out what a Prussian 1809 Potsdam is/ its historical significance. Thanks Mom! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanksgiving. 

Forget about the actual holiday where a bunch of "settlers" from England were fed by Native Americans while struggling to survive in the "new world" only to repay the favor by later killing them and taking their land.

I'm talking about the being home with your imperfect family, fireplace roaring, dogs sleeping on the couch, football on the TV, beer in your hand, the smell of every awesome food ever being cooked and hopefully snow on the ground outside - kind of thanksgiving.

Maybe not the best "thing" in life, but definitely the best day every year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not many people understand how much money you can make on eBay selling random stuff around your house.

I'm not saying that you can earn a full time salary using eBay (although some businesses rely heavily on the service) but if you have old baseball cards, vintage clothing, old records, kid toys in good shape, video games that you no longer play etc. you can make a few extra bucks on the side.

You can list a lot of items on eBay for free and the percentage eBay charges is 10% of the final selling price.

As long as you are responsible enough to make sure you ship items on time, you can do decent for yourself. I paid for a lot of my beer in college this way. </TEXT>
