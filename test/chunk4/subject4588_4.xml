	<TEXT> Exactly. The equivocation is so deep that reforming the education system is palliative at best, worthwhile as it may be. I fear that pushing for critical thinking does not get at the issue here, because anyone can co-opt that language. For example, someone might peddle intelligent design while still believing he is using critical thinking.

There is not merely ignorance, but tools and media to motivate such ignorance. Getting to the bottom of that well is the critically important mission. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, I would think so. It seems that my understanding of school systems in the US (not encyclopedic by any means) is that any progress will go only as far as the parents accept. The idea of a course in logic (and I would add a blend of epistemology/political philosophy) might be supported in school system with a lot of left-leaning folk, but good luck getting that going in Texas or Mississippi. 

Compounding the problem, which you've diagnosed well, is that there is a fundamental mistrust of the government among the people that need the most education. People might be against reform *because it's coming from the government* in addition to it being "liberal" in content. 

But a much larger problem is there is a false equivocation vis--vis myriad, contentious debates in politics and elsewhere, and no entity is trusted enough to be the arbiter of knowledge. An epistemic Wild West, in my view.

EDIT: Added a few words for clarity. </TEXT>
