	<TEXT> This. Everyone acts like kids should be able to do whatever they want, explore whatever they want, become whoever they want, etc., but that mindset doesn't take into account the differences between children and adults. Children do not have fully developed brains, are highly impressionable, and are not capable of making fully rational decisions. We can't just let them run off and do whatever they want because it will hurt them in the long run. </TEXT>

[CUT to unprecedented TC confessional] Debbie: I knew I had to play my second vote tonight because I actually serve as a ballot counter during election season, so I have a lot of experience weighing when votes are going a certain way. And tonight, my frontal lobe was just buzzing that the votes weren't going my way.

Jeff: Alright, Debbie will now vote again.

Debbie writes down Brad on the parchment. Voting Confessional: you CRUSHED MY HEART and now I'm crushing yours.

Debbie returns to her seat next to Brad, and as she does, says: Did you see that Brad? I voted more than you! </TEXT>

And I'm not sure what your first point has to do with anything. Adam isn't talking about when it happened to Zeke, he's talking about when Varner did it. He said in the tweet something like Varner insisted that what he was doing wasn't wrong. That happened 10 months ago and he has continuously apologized for it and taken it back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It isn't. I see no one applauding Rob M for what he did, and with Parvati, Parvati didn't really have a close relationship with Ozzy, it was Amanda who did, and she didn't betray him.

Dawn is held to a high standard because her bond with Brenda went outside the game. Brenda was there to comfort her as a person, not as a player, and made a real friendship with Dawn, or at least she thought. So when Dawn betrayed her, I can completely understand her questioning how important the personal drama really was, and therefore testing it in her FTC speech. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I know everyone loved them and that just annoys me even more. To me, I enjoyed this show in spite of it being Damon Lindelof. I enjoyed how grounded and realistic it was for the first season and a half, despite the fantastical premise. That was an awesome contrast in my eyes. But then Damon Lindelof couldn't resist doing the same thing he did Lost and had to add in some lazy loss of reality bullshit like he always did and it was frustrating to me... Because that's not what this show was about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Super Mario Galaxy. I was 11 when it came out and a few years afterwards I very vividly remember a winter day when it was just me and my mom and I was playing this game while she made dinner and then we had dinner together. It sounds so simple but for some reason it's really stuck in my head as being special. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's almost as if someone can think that someone can't be a different gender or sex, but still treat them as a normal human being. People like to demonize transphobic/homophobic people, but I think most of the time they're more against the concept than the actual people who do it. </TEXT>
