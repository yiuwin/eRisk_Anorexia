	<TEXT> I normally start with music. 
1. Choose a feel or mood you want to portray 
2. Put together a simple chord progression or guitar part that has the feel you're looking for 
3. Add all of the little bells and whistles and embellishments that finish the music out 
4.play the song as many times as possible with an open mind(don't search for lyrics just let them come to you) 
5. Make the lyrics whatever the song makes you feel 
That's my usual process :) 
It usually  works for me because I am letting the song speak through me, not the other way around  </TEXT>

But really the weight of the les Paul does give it a slightly different tone because of the way the the sound resonates through the wood so it does slightly matter

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I play rhythm guitar in a pop punk band with a lot of blues/Americana influences thrown in the mix. I know the obvious choice for me would be a les Paul, but everyone plays a les paul and I would really like a unique look.
Does any body have any ideas as to what guitars would be the best for me? 
(I've been thinking about getting a SG solely because of the looks, but I don't know if it's the right choice sound-wise) my max price is going to be around 1700

EDIT: I said I would like a unique sound, when I really meant to say unique look.  </TEXT>

This is a song I wrote 
I normally just play guitar for my band but I sing occasionally, usually for therapeutic reasons. I just wanted to test the waters with my vocals. I'm a 19 year old male and I sang the melody and all of the harmonies. 
Any critique would be great because I am truly a beginner

Keep the to your self if you don't have anything to say that will help someone out. That's the point of asking a question: learning the answer, not having your confidence shot down by a real douche bag with no life. 
In regards to Charlie hunter not being heard of, I don't think I've ever heard of you before either, does that make you a shitty guitar player too? 
I hereby return your "FAIL" to its true owner.
