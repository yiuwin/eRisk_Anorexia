	<TEXT> Thanks for that information. I was of the idea that the in the Middle East (broadly speaking, of course) had become drier, actually, much like what it is like today; that before it had been quite similar to today's Central Europe. And as the environment got drier and less hospitable for hunting and gathering, people would gravitate towards the remaining areas, etc. But that doesn't seem to be the case from your answer.  </TEXT>

Los primeros 6 meses la madre tiene licencia (si es un embarazo riesgoso, empieza antes). Cobra un subsidio del estado en base a su sueldo (pagado desde sus aportes a la seguridad social), y no se le permite tener ninguna otra fuente de ingresos. Luego de los seis meses, ella o el padre pueden tomar otra licencia hasta que el mocoso cumpla 2 o 3 aos (creo que hace poco lo extendieron a 4, pero no estoy del todo seguro), por supuesto, la mensualidad es ms alta cuanto ms corta sea la licencia. Durante ese tiempo, el empleador no le tiene que pagar nada, pero est obligado a mantenerle el puesto de trabajo (cosa que muchas veces no pasa, pero eso ya es otro tema). Durante la "segunda" licencia, el progenitor en cuestin puede tomar un trabajo medio tiempo, laburar desde casa, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a boss like that. This was 20 years ago, before mobile phones. I had the late shift and that cuntbasket would call in the morning to ask something stupid that could of course wait until I got to the office. It got so bad that I stopped taking calls in the morning, screening them with the answering machine. She would call literally a dozen times. When I got to work in the afternoon she would ask me where the fuck I had been, to which I would answer every time "that's my business". It climaxed one Sunday morning when I picked up the phone thinking it was a friend (I was going to a BBQ that day). It was snowtwat and the 7 dicks telling me that I *had* to go to the office because there was something urgent, etc., etc., etc. I refused on the basis that I had already made plans and when she started berating me, I hung up. She didn't say anything the following Monday, but a few days later someone made a massive cock-up and she threw it at me. I was in the last days of a probation contract and didn't get another one. 

But wait, there's more!

One late evening, about a month later, she calls me to ask me to please help her. They were short handed and I was their last chance to make an important deadline the day after. "You gotta be joking" was my answer, before I put down the phone and carried on with whatever I was doing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a completely different environment. I don't think the big brewers are very happy with the smaller guys getting big, but there's little they can actually do about it, other than throwing money around; and even there, there's only so much money can buy. There are also a lot of small cafs and bars that will never be interesting for a macro brewery, but which smaller breweries are more than happy to serve. 

I believe that if the 3-tier system were to be repealed, things would probably be even worse for the smaller breweries </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here? For sure! The number of microbreweries in the last decade has grown almost eight fold. Most of them are still brewpubs, but there are many that live mainly, if not exclusively, out of distribution.

ntick Pivovar opened five years ago and last year brewed almost 12,000 hl (in CZ, microbreweries are up to 10,000 hl/year). 90% of it distributed. And they make only two pale lagers year-round, plus a few seasonals (all lagers, too).

But it's the regional breweries that kept diversity alive. Those that managed to survive four decades of communist neglect and one decade of capitalist depredation and mismanagement are mostly thriving today, even when the industry as a whole has been shrinking or stagnant. They make classic styles, but cheaper and (arguably) better than the big brands.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sort of thing is legal in the Czech Republic and I'm sure in a few other European countries as well.

Let's say you have a pub (or are planning to open one). You can contact a brewery, or they can contact you, (usually it is the bigger ones, but mostly because they are the only ones that can afford it). You reach an agreement with them whereby they give you all the usual marketing trinkets (glasses, umbrellas, signage, etc.) and lend you the dispensing system and taps. If you are big enough, they might even offer you money to invest in your pub (whether you'll use it for that, or not, it's up to you). This is all legal, with contracts stating how much money changed hands (and I've heard of some very interesting figures). In exchange of that, you commit to buy a certain monthly volume for a certain number of years. If you want to sell beers from another brand, the taps are theirs and they won't let you use them for that. Of course, they can't do anything to prevent you from putting up your own tap to sell whatever brand you'll want, but you'll still have to buy the agreed volume every month, and if you don't sell it, it's your problem. There's another kind of agreement that involves a virtual partnership between you and the brewery, but I am not all that sure how it works yet. 

Smaller breweries will not give you money, but they will give you the taps, and maybe a free keg or two every now and again, if you ask nicely. Or they will cover the costs of sanitising the dispensing lines. 

The major difference here is that we don't have anything remotely similar to the 3-tier system. Breweries can and do sell straight to retail or even to the end consumer, in their own restaurants outside the brewery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Setting a shop of fire. Accidentally. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and one of them said he had a cat-chaser kind of thing, the sort that lights in lots of colours. We wanted to light it, but we needed a dark place to fully appreciate its beauty (it was the middle of the day), so we noticed a sationery shop that was closed (this was back when shops could still afford closing down at midday for lunch) and therefore, dark. (we were not the sharpest knives in the kitchen). 

We lit up the cat chaser. WOWed at the display of colours, as it skittered on the floor, until it disappeared behind a counter, in the back of the shop. We were nodding our heads in appreciation, when one of us noticed a light flickering by the place we had last seen the cat chaser. It took us, I think, half a second to notice what it was and what we had done. We got the hell out of there as fast as we could. We ran around the block and walked past the shop. The place was on fire already. A bit later, the fire brigade came and put it out. Fortunately, nobody got hurt and the damage was limited only to the shop, but we all felt really bad because we used to buy stuff for school there and the owners were really nice people. 

As far as I can tell, our parents never knew about it.  </TEXT>

I think Jesus's fame is due more to his resurrection than to whatever advice he might have given. There must have been other preachers with good advice back then, but none of them, as far as we know, came back from the dead. 

In any case, if their status as celebrities is a result of the quality of their advice, fair enough, but I guess we'll agree that those are quite exceptional cases.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, the law is not in effect any longer. Bavarian brewers use it (to some extent) to get "Bavarian Beer" PGI.

It was never meant for consumer protection--that's a myth--it was firstly to reserve the use of wheat and rye for bakers (though the law would be amended relatively shortly afterwards to allow nobles, IIRC, to brew with wheat and rye in summer; the current legislation allows wheat, rye and sugar only for top fermented beers), and secondly, to streamline tax collection. Brewers would have to pay a tax on how much barley the used. A similar law was in force in England from the 17th to the mid-late 19th century. 

The law would be later used as a protectionist tool and even as a political bargaining chip, when Bavaria put as a condition to join the German Federation in 1871 (?) that it's beer law be applied in all the other states.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they had gone alone, they would not have fared batter than Poland. As well equipped as their armed forced are said to be, they were in no position to fight an invasion from both Germany AND Austria, due to sheer numbers. 

However, IF France and the UK had not betrayed Czechoslovakia, there might have been a good chance that Germany would have been defeated. Apparently, Germany would have been in no position to fight a two front war versus Czechoslovakia-Poland and France-UK. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, unfortunately, it's true. How many, I don't know, but they are mostly older, more inward looking and quite fit the stereotype of the Zeman voter. I won't claim it is a majority, but I do not think it's a tiny minority, either. It'd be interesting to know how many of the people who did not vote in the presidential election (in either or neither of the rounds) are Zeman supporters today. I'd wager there is a survey on that, but I can't be arsed with looking for it. 

Another thing you might not be taking into account is that many people "in Prague" may have voted elsewhere in the country. I know quite a few that by all accounts live in Prague, but don't have permanent address here.  </TEXT>

I'm not sure about that. I know many people in Prague who support him, unfortunately. 

To me, he's an opportunistic cunt who does not hesitate to change his views if he can make a political profit out of it; all while polarising society even further. He has become quite dangerous, and I'm afraid that, barring a serious health problem, unless a serious candidate appears, he will be reelected. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Censorship". That word gets thrown around too liberally.

Last time I've checked, FB was a service provider and not part of the public administration or a public authority. As such, they are free to set any policies they see fit with regards to what they will allow to be displayed through their service; always within the law. As stupid as I think FB's ban of that photo in particular, and other similar ones is, I don't see anything reproachable in it. 

But hey, FB bashing seems to be all the rage now, and a good tool to distract the attention from other, really serious matters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just nitpicking on the "yeasty" solution. 

The wort is what you have after mashing (basically, an enzimatic transformation of starch into simple sugars). Hops would be added before the yeast is pitched, either being boiled together with the wort, or separately (though, what would be added would be the resulting brew and not the hops proper). Then the yeast would be added. I think it was pretty much the same with Gruit or other flavouring agents. 

Could you provide some sources about the bit on the sprouts being a source of fermentable sugars? Or maybe we can summon u/larsga, who's been researching this field for a while. 

The beer would have been slightly carbonated, if drunk fresh. The yeast produces CO2 during the fermentation. I've drunk a fair share of beers (home made and commercial) straight from fermenters and conditioning tanks and you do get some degree of carbonation.  </TEXT>

Ya en mis aposentos, llegando al clmax del acto coital, mi recatada compaera de lecho libera una faltulencia de proporciones casi mitolcigas; del tipo que entre mis amigos habra sido justa merecedora de una ovacin de pie. 

De ms est decir que, por un instante, me qued estupefacto. La nia emiti un sonido como si le hubiesen tirado un balde de agua helada. All fue cuando solt la carcajada. Ella corri a encerrarse en el bao, gritando "Perdn, perdn, perdn!". 

Mis intentos de ir a consolarla fueron vanos. No por culpa de ella, sino porque cada vez que quera levantarme de la cama para ir al bao, empezaba a retorcerme y llorar de la risa. 

Cunto tiempo pas, no estoy seguro, pero luego de unos momentos, la dama, que haba dejado un fuerte recuerdo de su presencia en el aire, sali del bao, tom sus cosas y se larg. 

La relacin no prosper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think the analogy is correct. Sexual harassment is usually premeditated and extended over time, whereas punching someone in the face, like this case, is, more often than not an impulsive act. 

But perhaps you are American and see things in a different way than a British manager would. 

In any case, it is up to each company to decide whether they want to hire such person. If the person who threw the punch (in this case, a celebrity, but that shouldn't be the point) has not even been prosecuted, but only (rightfully) fired, I don't see any problem with their getting another job in the same field. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've just abstracts of the papers you've linked. Given its scope, I'd venture that the first one carries more weight, but I could be wrong.

 The main difference here is the length of the day.

But are infants aware of that? They tend to sleep most of the day, don't they? It could be, though, that the parents will take them out less in when it's dark, in which case, the effect would be, at best, indirect, as the weather and the season will probably affect the behaviour of the parents, which in turn will have an effect in the development of the child.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The short answer is no.

In many European countries children usually go outside all year long, even in winter. I live in the Czech Rep. and we did it with our daughter and see parents going out their children even in sub-zero temperatures. But that regardless, what if the parents are people who prefer to stay inside? Or what if they move to a different country during the child's infancy. Hell, even moving a few kilometres from the city to a rural area can have a non-insignificant effect on the parents's habits that will affect the development of the child. For example, I know people who take the baby outside in the pram and let them sleep there, even in the dead of winter, while they are sitting inside watching TV (which seems to be common practice in some Nordic countries). Would they be able to do that if they lived in a flat without a balcony? 

Personality is the result of environment and, to some extent, genetics. I doubt the date of birth, even indirectly, plays any role in it.  </TEXT>
