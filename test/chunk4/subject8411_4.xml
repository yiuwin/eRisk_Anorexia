**Other Things About Me:** I enjoy being a chill guy, I don't trash talk often, but when i do its normally good natured banter and never toxic. I have never betrayed and have ALOT of experience with fighting... being on HCF for over 16 maps and participating in every EOTW and many KOTHS/Palaces. But what i have yet to do is win an EOTW. That is what I want to do this map.. Is to finally get the EOTW win that I have been looking for since I joined Map 3. If someone from a large faction could give me a shot I would be very, very, grateful. 

Thanks and yes...I'm back,

Chase </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MAP 2: Joined for like 5 minutes and thought I could h@ck the server. Couldn't, left.


MAP 3: Joined and led a noob faction called Amnesia with some random guy I met in spawn. Logged in during EOTW and died very fast


MAP 4: Wandered around, used the spawn cannon for the first time, and while admiring the spawn cannon got blown up by a creeper. Joined ShadowWalk for the first time. Thanks to Mrme I didn't quit the server here, he gave me a faction when nobody knew me. I had a lot of fun with my new friends and fought at my first EOTW with ShadowWalk and Baddies.



MAP 5: Joined ShadowWalk at the beginning of this map, played around and had the most fun I have ever had in a map, met the UHF guys, learned to never trust anyone after Toontasker betrayed us(I cri) got my first kill and fought at another EOTW and was the first of the hypno alliance to die.



MAP 6: Biggest/best base I have ever been part of building and fought with the legendary guys often, camping each other all the time. Also, fucking Y_ankees.



MAP 7: Led my first major faction Apocalypse, and when that failed I joined Tyrants with Shotzvee, like nobody was on at one point so I took a tour around the entire map and humped everyone's bases.



MAP 8: joined hcfuni, didn't do much this map. Also played for TowerTech which was fun while it lasted.



MAP 9: Was inactive for the first week or so and then I joined ThirdLaw with TravisArmstrong, Shotz, Torremth, and pkeffect. I then left and played in a fac with a friend.



MAP 10: Played with my friend and was the first one in full diamond. Not much else happened this map for me.



MAP 10.5: Officer'd Accido/ ShadowWalk and then joined Freeshot, then when that failed joined 8BALL where I met a lot of my current friends. 



MAP 12: Played as my first trading faction: TastyCake with Porkchop, then left for the pvping fac Lucky7... We kinda sucked lol.



MAP 13: Battletoads! Had a lot of fun with my boys from Battletoads, even though we died a lot.



MAP 14: First Watcher map, didn't do much. Fast abuses, gets the big ban. Overall the most boring map of my life mostly cause I couldn't do anything.



MAP 15: Another watcher map, began to learn to code, starting to get tired of the monotonous watcher life.  Leaked the video of mikebain xraying and got busted.


MAP 16: More watcher, starting to get really bored, decide to have a little more fun with it, /warned Highlife for icanhazfacrip. He then came into mumble and got me in trouble.


MAP 17: Got demoted :c then joined CookieClan and officered them. Pretty inactive this map. Tried to introduce my IRL friend to HCF, he died a lot.


MAP 18: Played with quarts and created the failed Arena, joined DuckClan and went to palace and died and left the faction. Then joined Frontlines, which promptly died.

MAP 19: Axis, 30 man roster, big potential... But ultimately failed because people are idiots.  </TEXT>
