	<TEXT> The Baratheon sigil is probably changed to bring more attention to the crown instead of it being blocked by the antlers.

The Stark sigil is probably so as to make it clearer that it's a dire wolf, from far away it might look like a fox or something.

Edit: grammar </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The room was silent, as it always is, until-

*ring,ring,ring*

After 8 years, the phone rang. 8 years spent sitting at a desk and it all amounts to this one phone call. How long has Ethan spent sitting *daydreaming* in the hopes of the phone ringing just to give his mundane a sense of meaning, of worth?

With a gulp, Ethan picked up the phone, almost breaking into a sweat because of the anticipation, or maybe it was fear.

"Hello?"
"Ethan?"

The caller was a young man, no more than 23 perhaps. He had a soft, comforting voice and the fact he knew Ethan's name was unsettling yet it gave Ethan a sense of security, knowing that he was talking to someone familiar, yet a stranger at the same time.

"Yes, I'm Ethan, who are you?"
"Wow whaddya know, my name is Ethan as well, quite the coincy-dinc wouldn't you say?"

The man on the phone talked anxiously now, but tried, badly, to sound friendly. 

"So uh, what's uh, your uh, your last name?" The second Ethan asked, sounding more nervous now, perplexed to a state of shock, he wasn't even trying to sound friendly anymore. But their conversation wasn't all that strange, sure a phone call from a stranger with your name is weird but nothing to freak out about.

"Victor"

Ethan Victor could make out muffled voices on the other end of the line. He could also song, on a record player perhaps? It didn't sound like any song he's ever heard.

Another voice came on the line.

"Hello is anyone there?"

The second voice was powerful and booming, this man emanated confidence and was a stark contrast to Nervous Ethan.

"Yes I'm still here" Ethan Victor replied.
"Good, I almost thought the previous caller scared you away"
"Scare me away?, that fool?"
"You think he's a fool?"

There was a long silence, but Ethan knew the other man was still there, deciding.

"What's going on here?, who are you?"

"I am David Shaw, you are Ethan Victor. Where I hear, you think. There are -or were too many Ethan's   here for us to make a decision but now we are sure. For 8 years you have been a sentinel and for 8 years you have helped us. Now you will think for more, for us."

The door opened. David Shaw entered the room. He stretched out his hand for Ethan to take. 

And Ethan took it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been rewatching season 2 and I think Renly could have had a more interesting story if he wasn't killed by Stannis. We could've seen him 'hardening' and learning how to properly lead, him dealing with producing an heir and his relationship with Loras and maybe we could've seen a parallel between him and Stannis. Thoughts? </TEXT>
