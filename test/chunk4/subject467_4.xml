	<TEXT> I could do with a little advice here! Having graduated University i have been working for the past year as an editor/graphics designer for a small company. I started out on 13 000 and have had short one month contracts since then that have incrementally brought me to 18 200.

Looking online and applying for other work it seems to range between 20 000 and 30 000 for a junior position like mine.

They caught onto the fact i might be looking for other work and have  just offered me 20 800 and a 12 month contract. It seems they are trying to secure me a little better but i feel like i should be pushing for a little more given the time I've taken to learn the ins and outs of the place and my particular set of skills.

Ideally i would like to push for 25 000 but i don't want to risk them getting rid of me! Am i being unappreciative or should i be pushing for more now that they've offered?  </TEXT>

I've had these dreams as long as I can remember and the location changes a fair bit but its always me at school age really needing to take a massivve horrible dump. But it doesn't matter where I am, swimming pool, school, train, all I van find are "communal toilets" where everyone shits together in one big room or in cubicles with nothing more than saloon style doors that you can see over. I always end up really desperate and distressed. The weird part is that I really don't care about shitting in public when I'm awake, I've been to numerous festivals with horrible toilets and never had a problem!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every year i think i have it all figured out, and every year this theory is completely dis-proven, its like I'm a different person every 12 months. Its quite exciting but a bit cringe-worthy to look back on. 

I'm 24.

Does this ever stop? When i have kids how can i be more consistent? Do you define yourself every day bit by bit or is it something you gain from momentous occasions and encounters?

	<TEXT> Accurately but not as ergonomically. Say you go home for your 1 hour lunch break at 10 past 12. You spend 5 minutes getting back and 20 minutes eating and reading, you want a nap so you set a timer for 20 minutes which gives you enough time to sleep and get back to work in time.

With a digital clock-face this is easy to work out time by time but at a quick glance you still have to work out how much time you have left. With an analogue clock-face you remember the position the minute hand was at and anything forward of that is how much time you have left. 

Its not about accuracy, its about representation of time in cycles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. No no no NO. Liquid nitrogen should never be used to make drinks. The writers need to get their facts right, the place may have used it but it is not commonly used to make cocktails. 

They are thinking of dry ice or solid CO2 which is used in food all the time hence the massive picture of Heston who had nothing to do with the story.

Edit: In the picture he's even making ice cream with the CO2 method, (which makes the best ice cream possible!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Attention spans. I'm definitely guilty of it too but it seems like the world is moving towards ingesting smaller and smaller chunks of information. Reddit is a good example of this; we have so much information at our finger tips that we are driven to see as much as we can as quickly as possible, maybe only because it is there to be seen.

I'm only 24 but looking at kids entertainment today there is a noticeable trend in this too, games used to be a fairly large endevour requiring a fair amount of time an effort to master. Then you look at iOS and Android games that are designed to be picked up and played in 5 minute toilet breaks and kids love them! Same with kids cartoons; don't get me fucking started on adventure Time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The trick is to cook it slowly. Try using a medium sized pan with a little oil over the lowest heat you can. Break the eggs into it just as its starting to get warm and don't turn the heat up as you let it cook until the white is no longer runny. 

If you do it slow like this you avoid any bubbles in the egg at all, a runny yolk and beautifully creamy egg whites. They look really pretty like this and all you need then is some salt and pepper and maybe some chilli flakes to finish! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thought it was worth a shot here as i'm having a bit of trouble finding material!

I'm going to editing a promo for work which we will use to pitch a potential one off 50min episode to a television channel.

Its about webcams. And more specifically the kinky world of cam-girls. I'm after video clips of people doing weird and wonderful things on i guess pay per view webcam and i thought you beautiful kinky people might have a few pointers!

The catch is it cant be too seedy, this is a major channel so we are going for more comedy/light shock value rather than full on wtf, omg and gaping orifices.

I've had to do random promos before but my usual practice of ripping stuff off you-tube doesn't really apply here so if anyone has any ideas i will make you hypothetical cookies. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-08-21 18:44:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Why is it that some people feel crushing guilt about the most benign of things while others feel at ease pilfering and loitering with no remorse?

Personal bit: I work 7 days a week at two jobs, not actually that bad and is really good for paying off overdrafts but leaves my free time full of chores. So when i do get an hour or two of free time i sit twiddling my thumbs and feeling bad for not being productive. It seems that every high is followed by a crushing low: go out for some drinks and smile for an evening? Deep depression the next morning until i start work and feel normal again. Same with spending money, my bike was stolen from my house so i saved up the 400 to buy a new one but got hit round the face with a guilt bat once i put the order in.

In the words of Mark Corrigan: "Why do i feel guilty, i feel guilty for everything from not recycling to waring certain socks more than others; I'm sorry stripy blue but you're just too casual" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me and my brother would go to friend's houses and be amazed at the tonnes of video games that they never seemed to play or were totally bored with. Not to mention all the colorful electronic toys, fake guns or exotic board games.

Then they would come to our house. We lived on a building site in a [mobile home](http://www.demountablecontainers.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/container_construction_office_131.jpg). actually it was more like 7 of these bad boys put together and it didn't matter what you did to them: want a new door? Get the jigsaw out and cut a hole. The point is where i was amazed by all the toys and games at their houses they were far more amazed by the construction equipment lying around (friends had a sand pit, we had a working JCB) and even better the cool "projects" our dad had built us that littered the acre of building site and woods that made up our garden. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She has just come back early from a night out with some other managers (they weren't drinking much apparently). I had a call from her saying she felt really drunk and she was coming home but felt really paranoid. 

She has just got back and said a guy was following her the last bit of the way but ran off as she got near our door (i heard shouting outside).

She doesn't seem to be able to focus well and is all over the place (I've only seen her like this after a long night out as she is somewhat of a tank when it comes to booze.).

I'm pretty sure her drink was spiked so what should i look for and as in the title: what should i give her besides sleep and water? </TEXT>
