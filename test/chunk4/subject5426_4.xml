	<TEXT> I cooked a couple of eggs with provolone cheese and ham in the microwave, broke college kid style; It was actually pretty good, would try again.

  
I would love to try almond, caramel mocha, and chocolate @ 0mg.
Thanks for the giveaway! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in the day when I rented snes games from blockbuster, it wasn't ever on the shelf, not sure why. Probably because there were multiple damn copies of street fighter and zelda 3 taking up the shelf space...
  
  
Then when n64 came out they removed all snes games... There wasn't many places to rent games near me either so... </TEXT>
