	<TEXT> Glass "freebase" ("meth") pipe with a torch lighter. 75-125mg. Let it burn and a fair bit of smoke to develop before you inhale, or else you'll just get the powder in your mouth and/or not enough smoke. Hold it in for 10 seconds. Should last about 10-15 minutes and it is incredibly intense, so I would recommend doing it somewhere peaceful from where you won't have to move. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AL-LAD. It is briefer in duration - about eight hours - and gentler on both the stomach (I tend to puke) and the mind. It is very cartoonish and in my experience is far less likely to induce a freak-out or a bad trip. 

One time on AL-LAD, on a very windy evening, I was convinced that the bunch of trees in the distance was a gigantic octopus with tentacles swirling through the sky.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MET is erotic, not very visual beyond a minor sparkliness.

EPT is sedating, yet somewhat stimulating at the same time. Things move faster. 

No idea about MiPT. </TEXT>
