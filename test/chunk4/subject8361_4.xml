	<TEXT> Yeah sure! Well, before, I wore my hair either pulled back in a bun, ponytail, or braid everyday. It would get really knotted and frizzy and washing my hair was a real chore. I'd shower daily but skip washing the hair every other day. In the shower, I'd squeeze a palmful of Pantene daily moisture and scrub it throughout all of my hair, and wash it out with my hands under the showerhead. Then, when the suds were gone, I'd put in the 1st palmful of Pantene daily moisture conditioner to allow my brush to get though my hair. Then when untangled, I'd slop on more conditioner and twist it into a bun to absorb while I washed/shaved my body. After a few minutes, I'd take the hair down and brush the conditioner completely out under the showerhead. Then I'd rub my hair to be semi dry with a towel and throw it in a bun and let it dry on its own. If I needed it to look nice, I'd straighten it. 

For the past two days, I've had my hair down daily.  I washed it both days in my shower. I don't have my new sulfate free shampoo yet, so I used Pantene daily moisture but only on my scalp. I massaged half a palmful into my scalp then washed it out with my hands under the showerhead. Then, turning the showerhead away, I used a small amount of conditioner to detangle as I combed through my hair with my fingers. I flipped my hair to one side and combed it that direction and then slowly turn my head upsidedown and kept combing. I applied a generous palmful of my conditioner and combed that through with my fingers. When the conditioner was evenly spread, I cupped water from the shower head to scrunch my hair up with my palms. I put my hands full of water under the tips of my hair and cupped it up to my head. I repeated this for about 2 minutes then turned off the tap and repeated without water until no more water squeezed out. I got out with my head still down and grabbed a gotten T-shirt. Laid it out of the bed and let my curls fall vertically onto it (the same way they were when I was scrunching). I wrapped the T-shirt around my head and slept like it. Woke up, took them down. I slightly moistened my hands with water and scrunched them a little bit more. I applied a modest amount of Pantene curl mousse. And yeah :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted the photo on the left two days ago asking for advice. I bought new curly hair friendly hair products but they are still shipping, this is just the difference between using a brush in the shower vs. finger combing, using shampoo on all my hair vs just on my scalp, air-drying vs plopping, and combing out conditioner vs squish to condish. I am so excited for the results when I get rid of my sulfates and introduce some product. Anyway, thanks lovelies!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! The last 6 of so inches of my hair curl up regardless of the length. I'm nervous about shampooing less often! I feel like my hair looks greasy at the roots after a couple days. Ill give it a shot though! Is there a brand you recommend? </TEXT>
