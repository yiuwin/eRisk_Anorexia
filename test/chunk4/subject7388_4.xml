	<TEXT> It works almost perfect on my PC, get a Nvidia GTX970 and a decent i5 or i7 with 8 or 16GB RAM and a SSD.

I played 77 hours and it only crashed maybe two times, cant complain about stability.

I noticed with the new mech tank i also get some small framerate issues when i go full rampage with it. I think the physics calculations slow down the game when you move too many objects at once.

Works well on PC:
