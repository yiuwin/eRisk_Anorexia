	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It has came to my attention that many people are not using the spoiler tag and properly having the correct title that can void any spoiler information.

We do have subreddit rules regarding any spoilers and although a thread might have been missed, we still need people to follow it.

I will start suspending people for a short period of time for not following the rules from now on.

Also we would appreciate it if people report any posts that pops up not following the spoiler guideline or breaking any subreddit rules. 


Since this sub doesn't have much traffic beside the day that a new episode airs, we don't frequent it so we need people to also report any posts we might have missed. 

*Also sorry about the thread that was up over 1 day with a spoiler in the title*


**tldr; Please follow the subreddit rules and anybody that breaks it will now start getting suspension that will lead into a ban. Also report any thread or comments you deem has broken the rules.**  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have decided not to continue with this thread due to the fact that I got banned from submitting further(comment or make posts) and the mods have not even talked to me about the ban when I did nothing wrong on this subreddit. 


I cannot fight against the ban if they don't talk to me about it through the messages and since they run the subreddit, nothing I can do on my part. 

Since they feel that they don't want to talk and they think all my contribution to the sub is nothing, no need for me to contribute anymore from this point on. 

Feel free to look through my contribution/profile even to see if I did something wrong: https://www.reddit.com/r/funkopop/search?q=phoohthree restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all#page=3

Obviously this is all a rumor so if it is true, we will see it being announced very soon. Hopefully if it is true, I hope they are facing each other and not facing us in the current 2 pack form.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I am from the Funko pops community and there was a leaked from a website that showcased unfinished glam shots of pop designs for upcoming movies and Funko has worked on taking them down but I did manage to get a list of the Civil War movie pops of the first wave and it contained a small plot about a certain hero. 


Keep in mind, a lot of the future releases always get leak before the intended street date about upcoming movies, Star Wars was one of them. 

Source on the website: http://www.southernhobby.com/search-results-gallery?name=Pop%20Marvel desc releaseStartDate releaseEndDate orderDueStartDate orderDueEndDate productType=3 category=0 subcategory=0 subSubcategory=0 subSubSubcategory=0 isAvailable=False search=True solicitationDate

But here is the list if you care about and you will see at the end of a certain somebody's ability in the movie.

**The List** 


Captain America

Iron Man

War Machine

Black Widow

Agent 13

Scarlet Witch

Black Panther

Crossbones

Winter Soldier

**6" Giant Man (Ant Man)** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You guys might remember my post from front page about the Zootopia glams and pop line list well the following was also found on there but was taken down by Funko later.

http://www.southernhobby.com/products/detail?p=35767 Only the Mystery mini list is up now on there. 

I got a preview list of the pops that were on there and be warned, it has some spoiler to some of the plot to the movie. Sadly still no Falcon in the first wave.
