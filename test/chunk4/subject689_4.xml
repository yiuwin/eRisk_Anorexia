	<TITLE> Wrong parking spot, wrong time. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-08 09:24:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> An associate of mine parked at a golf corse in Livonia when the thunderstorms hit late Thursday night and I have never seen such extensive water damage to a parked carin person. We hesitated opening the car door thinking water would rush in, but opened it anyway. It was too late. The damage was done. At least 6 inches of water covered the floor (water just over my knees). The owner sat down, started the car, and backed out. In 3 feet of water. Couldn't believe it. The entire exhaust system was completely submerged, not to mention 1/2 the engine block. 50% chance the car dies in 4 months. 
If anyone has any advice or has been in this situation, let me know. All comments are welcome. </TEXT>
