	<TEXT> It has not been sold yet,but i know the frontrunner is a chinese  company that makes   likes CNC parts for tech,as well as.

The other current bidders on the site are.

Sany   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sany

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foton_Motor

and a few firms  that seem to have no public presence on the web so are probably state owned enterprises  which won't get  passed by the govt anyway.


Hyundai looked at the site as well.

But all of the buyers only seem to want parts of the site not the whole  platform,so i would find it very likely  that they sell half the site off.

Russel kogan   was intrested in it as well to look at making computer cases or some shit. but i think that was just them trying to get some pr  he could never afford the capital for that. </TEXT>

You understate it though.

I was in line to vote  few years back and the dude in front of me legit thought that,the greens Candidate would make them release all the animals on his farm  as it's cruel to keep animals like that.
no matter wat i said he still thought they would try to shut his farm down.
Who does he vote for instead,susan ley  wow that turned out well.
Some ppl are too stupid to have the rights of citizenship .

Voters are frankly quite fucking stupid in the decisions here.

Remember this is the dude who gave 20k to charity but when he found out it was for homeless ppl he sued them for the money back,he openly thinks homeless ppl are a blight on society 
Harvey had two children with his first wife, Lynette.[7] He remarried to Katie Page in 1988; they have two children.[8] In 1999 Page became the CEO of Harvey Norman.[9]

In an interview in 2008 he described giving charity to the homeless as "a waste", and said that it was "helping a whole heap of no-hopers to survive for no good reason".[10] He later claimed the comments were taken out of context and he did give money to homeless charities, among others.[11] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it's not like i got my definition out of a dictionary.
or anything.
Nah,yeah im totaly lazy.
Fuck im so lazy i can't even type right now
     

Definition of fascism

    1
    often capitalized :  a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition

    2
    :  a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control
    early instances of army fascism and brutality  J. W. Aldridge
But yes tell us all how  the dictionary is wrong.
let thy ingorance fly and a man can be shown the world.

##severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition 

All of these happen under the current govt


Next time do some research before being triggered please.

I never said the govt is fascist.
i said it has been leaning to fascist tendency. but hey this is reedit where users get mad and talk shit about nothing they have any idea about so what the hell have at it kiddo.
Oppressing an entire class of ppl with politics and making speaking out against the govt is straight out of the  fascist and  freikorps mentaltity.

	<TEXT> No it's not.
hence why i linked the definition of it before.
Fascism  a govt of intolerant or extreme  agenda politics.

The govt clamping down on free speech  and  the press as well as certain subsets of society fit that definition.
So i don't know instead of  attacking ppl on reedit maybe read a dictionary.
History has shown us fascism is not  a quick burn to be created.




Yes the liberals are not really fascists  but a lot of policy enacted are on the path to freikorps stute   and other ideologys  as they don't have a central power from which authority derives,but it is getting a touch  totalitarian with it's policy and the way it treats ppl who speak out against it

We have the govt openly attacking citizens who ask questions.
That's a step towards fascism,We have a govt that does not allow the press to report on the govts actions.
We now have all our information actively collected  by govt agencys.
Intelligence agencys can now search your shit with no warrants in regards to electronic data.
We have been reved up to hate a a certain subset of society (see the hatred of immigrants or muslims) Remind you of anyone?. remeber they wanted to make all immigrants have openly visible ID on them at all times so that officers could question them.

Yeah totes mate.

The actions the govt takes are textbook fascist tendencys.

Using the afp to conduct raids to make it opponent look bad is Putin level shit
Clamping down or  silencing anyone who  leaks against the govt.
CentreLinkRoboDebt shit.
Govt spent 400k  just to find the leaks instead of  fixing the problem lol.

No longer able to freely report on issues in govt run detention centres.
Not allowing free press to investigate "on water maters " regards to immigration.

NBN raid's.
Having the AFP raid the unions with ZERO evidence to back up the reason for doing them.

Warrantles searches by the AFP  by  making  law that says any connected network device(that's called the internet)

Yeah totaly not fascist or totalitarian at all.
Using the press to attack members of the publci who openly mock the govt.
SEE DUNCAN FROM Q AND A.

Using fear and misinformation to pass legislation and increase security measures.


Almost all of the above are taken directly from the NAOGM Nationlist agennda of Govt mandates  that come out of the play books of the Freikorps stutens (precurso to the nazi party)

Banks rarely ever get fucked cause they have LC  Insurance most of the time the debt goes bad they get a payout and make u sell ur home  and get paid twice.

The thing that will fuck them would be credit debt.
we have over 320 billion or more of that..

As i said i knew a guy bought an audi car.
had it 3 months  prob even less then just went and got another one as he no longer liked the shade of  the paint.

bought like a 80k caravan  and i know he only ever used it once in 2 years. always new shit  spent like  50k renovating his kitchen even though  his own sister is a realtor and said don't do it   it ads no value to the house  spending 20k on a stove.
Nah mate get me a fucking STOVE.
Aslo bought like   400 dollar  collectors shoes one of them was the wrong size. instead of returning it he just  binned it.

Get me a  a fucking  swish motorbike.
But neglects to  pay his home loan off which was  small as shit really.
People really can get fucked when they have this kind of money and don't prepare for the bad times.

i always put 10 percent of my weekly into a  netbank saver type account  that i have them lock for 6 months at a time just so i don't get tempted as it will let me slide for a few months if shit happens. also  i jumped on the AMD  train when they where less than 1.10 a share and just  offloaded some at  15 bucks so can't be angry right now </TEXT>

scott buck has done nothing but murder the fuck out of shows he has been given.
His sex feet under episodes are some of the series worst.

As i said above i knew a dickhead   in the mining rush was on close to or ever over 200 a year sometimes.
Spent it on useless shit like  buying a new car of the same make just cause he no longer liked the colour  and other stupid shit.

Lost his job then cried about how he can't afford his house payments.
Dude fuck you.

my 125k here might as well be 180 for me.
It depends where you live.
 My total housing cost per year  is almost  less than 30k including rates so the rest is just fuck around money since my job gives me free healthcare and pays my fuel costs.
Hoping to get costs even lower  as im looking at putting on some solar to bring down the power bill,cash in the  AMD stocks now that they gone up shoudl be golden


If it's 180k combined and in sydney you might be a bit pressed.

	<TEXT> So fucking true though.

Knew a guy was  swept up in the mining boom.
was getting well over  180,i think at one point he was getting 200 or more 
Bought a new car, one of the q series audis about 3 months later  did not like the colour  anymore so he just  went and got the same car  but in  red? really how vane are you.
Also had to have a new iphone every 6 months,usual shit bought a caravan that before i stoped seeing him used once in 2 years 

Fast forward 2 years has lost his job and can't afford the mortage on his house even though he could of paid if of  in 3  years or less with wife helping  if he had not been a dickhead.
Literally boggled my mind.
You are  on almost 200k a year and you  never got to paying off ur mortgage  take half ur salary pay off the house that way if shit hits the fan  you have equity.
Suffice to say i no longer see him as i just can't stand that level of stupidty
