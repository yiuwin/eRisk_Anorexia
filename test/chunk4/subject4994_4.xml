	<TEXT> Same here. I just can't wait for everybody to be healthy again! It will be fun to see what we can do once the whole team is together again. 

I honestly would rather see us play Golden State in the playoffs than San Antonio as I feel we match up better with GS than SA. The Spurs have just owned us for years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the NBA made a big step this year as they changed the fact that the division winner doesn't necessarily get into 4th or 5th seed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can see that, but I have to disagree on this one. I think winning your division should guarantee you a playoff spot, but overall record should determine your seed. 

It would make more sense to me if Washington played at Minnesota and Seattle played at Green Bay. It just seems like the Packers are getting rewarded for losing their division by playing the worse team (record wise). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So Minnesota wins, yet they get the tougher opponent in the first round of the playoffs. It kinda seems like a lose-lose situation by winning. 

Does the NFL need to restructure the playoffs based on record rather than by winning a division?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right. We are lucky to even be in the playoff picture with a losing record. I am hoping that all of these injuries will improve our bench, and I think Withey is somebody we should hold onto. 

However, if we finish 7th or 8th in the West, I am not sure if a sweep will be worth the experience. But I still want us to get into the playoffs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am very excited for when Gobert comes back and Withey steps in as a backup center and the Jazz never miss a beat on defense. 

I am trying to find the silver lining for the Gobert injury and just hope this experience adds to the depth of the team!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am probably biased, but I have never been a Melo fan. He can score, but besides that, I think he is one of those players that always brings his team down. 

Melo has seemed to fade out of the national spotlight because I think the media has started to realize that while he is a great talent, he doesn't elevate the game of others like LeBron, Curry, Durant, Westbrook. 

The only reason I would take Melo over Hayward would be because Melo isn't scared to try and take a game over. Sometimes I wish Hayward would just take control of the game when we need a basket and put the team on his shoulders.

But my answer is Hayward all day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope that Alec heals quickly. We could end up being quite lucky here and still be in strong contention for the 8th seed, even with all of the injuries.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went once when I was in high school and listened to the concert at the Gallivan center, which was pretty fun. They get some good bands every now and again to come and play, so that may be something that interests you.

Other than that, I haven't ever felt the urge to go and attend it again, especially when it's supposed to be 8 degrees outside this year.  </TEXT>
