	<TEXT> Alabama has put out more or less the exact same level of QB that 90% of all FBS teams has over the past 20 years.  Most schools don't have a 1st round QB taken at all in the past 20 years, and most that have been are busts.  If Alabama is a bad schooo to take QBs from then so is Texas, notre Dame, Florida, etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because stats = good NFL QB right?  Look at every Texas tech QB for the past 20 years.  He has stats because of the offense he plays in and he started for 3 and half years.  Dude can't even read the entire field.  They cut it in half for him.  That's not NFL material.  He's a good college QB but he's not even good enough to be a QB in the Canadian football league, let alone the NFL.  

Good grief man you're crazy.  He almost got benched his senior year because he's a terrible passer.  If he couldn't run around he wouldn't have ever played.  I'm done arguing with you because you're a fan boy who can't see things logically  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MLS is quickly becoming a league of a few teams with large fanbases and the rest with barely any fans.  Atlanta, Seattle, Orlando, Portland, LA, Toronto, NYC, San Jose, and Kansas City prop the rest of the league up in regards to attendance and hype.  The rest of the league usually gets piss poor attendance and has apathetic cities.  

There is absolutely 0 reason why Columbus, Vancouver, and Salt Lake City shouldn't have huge followings.  All of those cities have barely any pro competition and field competitive teams most every year.  Dallas, Houston, Boston, philly, Red Bull's, Chicago, Denver, and Montreal all have more competition and can get lost in the shuffle, but that still doesn't excuse the apathetic nature of those cities.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the people that identity as American are from poor backgrounds that intermixed so much with various other groups in the past and simply don't know.  Experts in the field of genetics/history say that these people are majority Scots-Irish.  

The largest ethnicity of southern white Americans is scots-Irish.  Scots-Irish settled the southern frontier, so Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi are mostly Scots-Irish.  The closer you get to the Atlantic Ocean the more English ethnicity it gets.  The scots-Irish were really poor which made them have to move inland to the Appalachians.   </TEXT>
