	<TEXT> What has your experience been with listening to music while taking heroic doses (6+ grams of shrooms, 3 DMT hits)?
Does it become more wonderful or does the experience itself become so important the sound stimuli becomes blas?
If it does the former, what songs do you recommend?

I haven't tried it yet, but some songs I think would be great:
degradation by Sigur Ros
The Island of Children's Children by Mum
Serpent Mound by This Will Destroy You
New World BGM - Bo Kyung Kim
Illium Faciem Tuam - Carlos Geusaldo (Sacred Works) </TEXT>
