	<TEXT> I am a walking disaster 

Yawned, knocked over a wine glass. It didn't break on impact, but when I stepped on it. Eight stitches in the arch of my foot.

Was running on a treadmill, tripped, somersaulted twice, rug burned my knees, elbows, shins, and forehead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Be there for her. Let her know you are going to support her. I don't know the situation, but her mother may be blaming herself. Odds are, her daughter's OD was accidental. Her mother may wish she had gotten her daughter help. Addicts will not stop their addiction for someone else - they have to want it for them. Her daughter's death is something she will deal with forever. 

From experience, you don't have to say anything to her yet. This is an unimaginable tragedy for the mother. When my cousin OD'ed, it was like the world stopped. I didn't know how to deal with it, so I numbed out. I couldn't cry. I didn't feel like I could accept it. everyone was bringing it up in every conversation and I wasn't ready to cope with the loss, so I got overwhelmed. I didn't really start grieving for several weeks. That being said, everyone is different and we all deal with grief differently. Respect her boundaries. Don't make every conversation about her daughter. 

Grieve with her. Let her know she is not alone. See if there is an ALANON or NARCANON in the area. It's like AA or NA for loved ones of addicts and alcoholics. They are really great resources to have. Again, I don't know her, but make sure she has support even if she tries to isolate herself. She won't accept this for a while, but this isn't her fault.

Now, how are you doing? Are you coping okay? Make sure you take care of you. Grieve. Give yourself time to process this. Talk to someone if you need to. Grief is not something that is dealt with in a short period of time. It is okay to feel weak and need someone to lean on.

Addiction robs everyone involved with the addict. Addiction is not done out of selfishness or rebellion.  It's a disease,  a mental illness. It's tragic. It pisses me off to no end that addiction is romanticized. If anyone is currently struggling with an addiction, you can get help. It is not something to be ashamed of. Do not do it for someone else, do it for you. Stay strong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since it's discovery, Neptune hasn't made a full revolution around the sun. Pluto didn't make one the entire time it was a planet. It still hasn't. 

Between 99.8 and 99.9 percent of our solar system's mass is taken up by the sun!

It takes up to a million years for a photon to leave the sun.

In the next 50 to 150 million years, Saturn will lose its rings. 

Jupiter's red spot is going away. The storm is steadily weakening. 

the Pillars of Creation are still seen by Hubble and other telescopes, but they no longer exist. they're simply so far away that the light is still traveling. 

Space is incredible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On Friday I opened a savings account and started to put money in. I spent most of Friday and Saturday applying for jobs. I got a call from one place yesterday and they want an interview on Friday. It's part time and I'm hoping to get another part time as well.

I am going to call my insurance tomorrow and see if the Mayo Clinic is covered by my insurance. I need to get the number from Nmom, though. If MC isn't covered (it most likely will be) I'll have to bite the bullet and go to the teaching hospital near the MC. I had a bad experience with psychiatric care there, so I'm reluctant to go. But I need to get answers for what's going on with me. I've got the referral from my neurologist, so that's all set.

I'm hoping to start summer classes at the college to get a head start on things. Hopefully I can move out withing the next year or so of things go well. 

I am trying to be positive. These are good things. I'm just emotionally drained.

The ball is rolling to get out of here. </TEXT>
