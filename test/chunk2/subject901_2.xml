It's my birthday and I wanted to make sure I was here to catch you. You deserve all the love possible.

	<TEXT> Here's my pitch:

"Glitter Load" (or G-Load)

Basic P.O.V. of a guy picking up a girl at a bar or whatnot. The girl is wearing glitter. That's his target. He takes her home and they do what all porns do. He gives her a facial and while she is sitting there with it on her face, he grabs a handful of glitter and throws it on her Emeril-style. Then runs away.

I met you backstage because my buddy was the eBay contest winner and got VIP tickets. He got his accordion signed. You offered us hot Colombian bean juice and cheese. You were the most amazing person. You sat on a couch with us and talked to us like a friend would and that was really cool.

I could ask questions about all your roles and projects, but I wont be greedy. Just two questions about one film:


Spinal Tap - did you write "Lick my Love Pump"? What was your first reaction of how influential your movie was to not just film, but music? Everyone talks about going "up to 11"!

	<TEXT> Too many people quoting Old Gregg that have no idea about the actual show. I'll be at some random party and someone starts saying, "Do you love me?" and "I've got a mangina!!!!!!". EVERY single time I assume they know more than those two scenes and start talking about Crimping or Milky Joe, and they'll look at me like some kinda freak. The only time I've been more let down in making a reference was at my old job at DSW. I got hired b/c of my athletic shoe sales experience and I attended training with two teen-year olds who got hired b/c they like shoes a whole lot. The person doing the training (upper 30s) brought us to the employee break room and the door had a combination lock on it. She told us the code was 1-2-3-4-5. I immediately replied, "1-2-3-4-5? That's amazing! I got the same combination on my luggage!" Both the teens and the trainer looked at me like 3 dumb deers in headlights. None of them had ever seen Spaceballs. I hated working there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. I'm the brother of the bride/Reverend of the wedding. This was a very special moment for these two. Weed is the thing that calms us down. If it were champagne, we would've taken a pic of that. If it were video games, I would've snapped a pic of them Skyrimming (Their characters names are Dimpleboffin and Scruffy). But they had one hell of a month before this wedding. People backing out of going, getting decorations together, the groom didn't have shoes to match his tux until 2 hours before the wedding, a bride's maid got sick, it rained before the outdoor wedding. But once the ceremony started, it was awesome. All their family were able to see it. They even streamed it live online for out-of-towners. My speech as Rev. was pretty damn epic (let's just say the first word out of my mouth was, "MAWWAGE!"). After it was done, their buddy gave them a celebratory joint. Once people started going to the reception, they shared it together and it was the most touching moment in pot history. I might be over exaggerating, but to them they couldn't have been happier. Twas a great moment. /u/TechSis : I love you and I was truly honored to wed you to your incredible husband. May you have many many more joints together.

	<TEXT> The confession by fat kid Lawrence 'Chunk' Cohen (Jeff Cohen) when interrogated by the Fratellis and he spilled his guts:

    Everything. OK! I'll talk! In third grade, I cheated on my history exam. In fourth grade, I stole my uncle 
Max's toupee and I glued it on my face when I played Moses in my Hebrew School play. In fifth grade, 
I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs and I blamed it on the dog... When my Mom sent me to the summer 
camp for fat kids and then they served lunch, I got nuts and I pigged out and they kicked me out. But the 
worst thing I ever done - I mixed a pot of fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the 
puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-
hua-huaaaaaaa - and then I dumped it over the side, all over the people in the audience. And t-t-then, this 
was horrible, all the people started gettin' sick and throwin' up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my 
entire life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First we hear from Kevin Conroy himself that he has been working on voicing Batman for the nest "Arkham" game: http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2013/05/19/kevin-conroy-confirms-hes-voicing-batman-in-a-new-arkham-game/

Now there's an update on the new Batman Arkham Origins game that states they didn't use him for the voice of Batman (no Hamill either): http://herocomplex.latimes.com/games/batman-arkham-origins-explores-one-formative-night/#/0

Does this mean Rocksteady is making another Batman game? If so, are we going to have two companies making two different timeline versions of Batman games at the same time?

	<TEXT> Hey AB! First off, Good Eats was (and still is) my favorite cooking show. I learned stuff while I salivated. Brilliant.

My sister loves you lots, but couldn't make it to this AmA b/c she is getting things ready for her wedding on June 2nd (Im gona be the Reverend). She wanted to ask you: "If you could plan a dinner with anyone ever, who would it be and what would you make to eat?"

I wanted to ask if I could get some words of wisdom for the Reverend speech I can surprise her with. Even a simple congrats from you would be the icing on her expensive wedding cake!

Love, me </TEXT>
