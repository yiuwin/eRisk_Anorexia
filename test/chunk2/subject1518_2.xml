	<TEXT> I've probably heard them through my walls as an unwilling participant when my roommate plays them, lol. I'm usually the kind of music lover that even if I can't typically stand an artist, I can at least find a song or two that I like by them. Like, I'm not a Miley Cyrus fan, but I will totally listen to Wrecking Ball on the down low if I'm feeling mopey, lol. But I haven't heard a DA song yet that I would replay, aside from Fatty Boom Boom and I think it only took me three times of hearing that to be set for life haha! 

But they've certainly attracted a much larger fanbase than I ever expected since I first heard them a couple years ago. Good for them! They may not be my cup of tea but I'm a music lover and I'm glad that everyone has different tastes and not everything sounds the same. That'd be sad and boring, for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was very heavy, a friend of mine told me after I had posted some photos on FB that "I was really hot in my older (skinny) pictures." 

That's been about 7-8 years ago and I still compare those two versions of me and replay that comment in my head. And I stopped posting photos of myself and haven't since.

And then there are the non-spoken memories that are seared into my brain - the disgusted looks from old friends and family I had not seen for a while, and then saw when I was at my heaviest. It never really goes away.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My ability to work out/go running has declined greatly in the last month. Part of it is because it's been soooo freakin' hot here and I get dehydrated and physically drained very easily just from the heat, and passing out is a big possibility. But the other part is that I know I'm not giving my stupid, greedy body enough fuel. I've tried upping my calories a little bit to see if that helped, but so far it hasn't AND I am tired of feeling anxious about eating over my self imposed limit, so ugh. I do take my dogs on walks, and my job is pretty physical....so I'm getting some exercise, just not as much as I want to. 

Started EC stacks today to see if they help with energy, and I've been asleep since I got home from work lol. Things apparently affect me differently. </TEXT>

Seriously, as soon as I got to my current lowest weight, my brain said OH OKAY LET'S EAT AND OR CRAVE ALL THE THINGS. I feel you.

But, tomorrow is another day and those wings were just a speed bump. Hang in there and try not to beat yourself up too badly! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been eating three meals a day lately, during the work week, in an attempt to stop feeling so shitty and tired. Breakfast is usually a Quest bar (180 cals), lunch is typically a salad with chicken and cucumber and Walden Farms dressing (under 200 cals) and for dinner I have 3-4 oz of lean meat with a vegetable side of some sort (around 200 cals). If I'm still hungry or craving something sweet after dinner, I will have a yogurt (80 cals). My goal is to keep it around 650 cals for the day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Logically, I *know* eating 700 calories a day is not "pigging out" but mentally, I am kicking myself for eating that much. I've been so tired and weak lately, and almost blacked out while driving on the highway this weekend, so I've been trying to make myself increase my calories a bit. And I'm hating it. I feel like I've put on weight from one day to the next, even though the scale has stayed the same. 

I'm just really tired and it's making me depressed. Sometimes I really hate this disorder. Sometimes I think it'd be nice to think about something else besides food, and calories, and hunger, and how I feel like shit. But then I remember that I hate feeling anything at all, or thinking about feelings and I feel comforted by having this disorder to keep my mind occupied. 

I'm just a mess right now. My mind is all over the place. I have no one to talk to about any of this. Sorry for rambling, but if I didn't get this out I was going to end up eating a gallon of ice cream or something equally stupid which would only make things worse, lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For fabric collars - CollarMania or Stillwater. 
For leather - Crazy Rebels or Ella's Lead.
For leashes - Ella's Lead rope leads are the only kind I use. 

These are all made for strong dogs, and I've never had equipment failure from any of these makers though I have had collars/leashes break on me from Lupine/Ruffwear/Kong and some of the other pretty well known commercial brands. I'm very particular now when it comes to what I use for my dogs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Around 500-600 a day. If I am having a super busy day (my job is pretty physical) I will allow an extra hundred or two hundred calories if I'm feeling exhausted or lethargic. My absolute limit is 800, and that almost never happens because it tends to kick me into a state of remorse fasting/anxiety.

I was eating around 350-400 but my stupid heart rate and blood pressure went apeshit so I had to increase a little. Ugh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of their stuff is amazing. Some is iffy. Some is gross. (But I use it anyways because hello zero cals, carbs or fat!)

I adore their BBQ sauce, but I'm not a huge fan of their salad dressings (very vinegary, even the bleu cheese). I bought some of their syrups and sweet sauces, but have not tried them yet.

I order from LuckyVitamin on EBay, as they have the lowest prices I've found for Walden Farms stuff. They are out of the Original BbQ right now, which makes me sad lol. I may or may not be responsible for their recent shortage. Ha!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in the hospital for several days, by the time I was conscious and able to talk, he had already given "his side". Unfortunately, my mental health that year wasn't the greatest plus his Dad was a police officer. He was able to convince them that my injuries were self inflicted, and since I had a history of self harm/suicide attempts, I was just the lunatic trying to make this " poor guy" suffer. 

He was very manipulative, and he isolated me from my friends and family over time until he was all I had. It made leaving him very difficult, even after he was violent. Please don't put yourself in that position. It's a very difficult, dangerous hole to climb out of.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My ex was abusive. It started out with something relatively minor, followed by copious amounts of apologizing and normal behavior and I thought things were fine again. *Until the next time.* And there is almost always a next time. Things escalate. Regardless of the "why" he did it, a person has no right to lay hands on you whatsoever. 

Please reconsider being with him. My ex ended up trying to legitimately kill me one night. We had been watching a hockey game and things were fine when he suddenly just lost his shit over a joke I made and I ended up fighting for my life. I have permanent damage from that night. 

If you stay, he will manipulate you into thinking things are your fault, and he will escalate. No relationship is worth your safety. Not one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm the opposite, typically. Craving something sweet doesn't happen to me often, but when it does I want ALL the sweets. 

I'm totally hooked on their Original Barbecue sauce. I eat grilled chicken and dip it in the BBQ sauce and it's amazing. Their salad dressings are...questionable, but again, for having zero calories/fat/carbs, I will eat it and not complain. I'm not expecting Chef Ramsey level flavor lol. One thing I've noticed is a lot of their dressings and sauces are quite vinegary tasting, but I am not repulsed by vinegar so it doesn't bother me. But if you have an aversion to vinegar, I'd probably avoid their dressings/BBQ sauces.

I do have some of their syrups/sweet sauces but I've not tried them yet.  </TEXT>

Note of caution - some of their stuff is super watery but I don't mind because hey, for zero carbs/fat/cals, I don't care. But some people find it gross or weird.

	<TEXT> I basically stay under 500 cals 99% of the time, but if I notice I am stalled out for a while at the same weight, for some reason upping my cals to 900-ish for a week seems to make me drop weight shortly after. I lose weight really strangely though. My weight will the exact same for days upon days, weeks even, and then one day I will have a sudden weight loss. It used to be in ten pound increments when I was heavier but it's slowed down to five pounds now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in the same boat. My Dr refuses to refill my Ritalin (I have been on it for years) because of the ED and ED related health crap. I understand why but it still sucks. I actually didn't take it for the appetite suppression, like she implied, I genuinely need it to focus on shit. 

Strattera is definitely an option. Unfortunately, it didn't work well for me. I was still all over the place and it made me nauseous all the time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, I've so been there. Are you into music? Music is my escape. I make it an obsession to find songs that can put into words what I'm feeling, because I have a hard time verbalizing what I'm thinking or feeling when I'm overwhelmed emotionally...music is distracting and therapeutic for me. Just try to avoid the depressing stuff, unless you want to wallow and cry it out. I'm an avoider, so I tend to avoid anything that invokes too much of an emotional response. 

Sorry about your troubles. Went through something similar a couple months ago with a friend and it sucked, bad. We talked all the time and then one day he just got tired of my shit and cut off all contact with me like I never existed.  </TEXT>
