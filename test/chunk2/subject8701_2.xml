	<TEXT> OK.

Now I am 100% positive this is about Charles. Numerous people are stating that the Press Office *only* said the Queen and Phillip were OK. No mention of Charles.

Again, still unsure as to why the Press Office has access to information this early due to the potential of it being leaked and unsure as to why they will just 'no comment' me.

However, for now, I am going to assume Charles is either dead or dying. 

-edit-

Press Office responded to me. I am now 100% confident this is the right thing. 

-edit 2- 

You can downvote me all you like. I am confident this news is about Charles. How serious it is remains to be seen.  </TEXT>

Now somebody is telling me that Trump may have launched nukes and this is an emergency meeting about the way in which the UK is going to react, hence why Corbyn and May likely have turned up at the Palace.

Again. Speculation. We will not know for sure for 28 minutes.  </TEXT>

Could be that we have had war declared on us/we have declared war. We may have used nukes, Trump may have used nukes. This is relevant to the Queen and May.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remember how we found the American Declaration of Independence a few weeks back in the UK?

Turns out America did not declare independence properly. All laws in the UK have now been invalidated and we are taking the US back. 

The US Military is in agreement and Her Majesty is instructing them. She figured the job would be more difficult, but the US Military are just going by patriotism to the country that owns them.

Still working out whether we can take India back.  </TEXT>
