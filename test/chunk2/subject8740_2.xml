	<TEXT> I'm relapsing into my eating disorder and I just don't have the time, energy or motivation to deal with it right now. I know that I should be eating more and drinking my Ensure plus and not working out but right now, but I'm able to justify my restriction as "not being hungry" since I don't technically skip meals, I just cut out snacks and eat less than I should at meals. According to my doctor I'm already underweight, and I know my weight will be down when I go in on Tuesday and she'll probably recommend that I look into residential again, or even try to admit me if my bloodwork  is abnormal at all, but I can't bring myself to care. Its not that I'm actively engaging in my eating disorder, I'm just not making myself do the things that they want me to do. I don't feel like I need to gain weight and there are better things for me to devote my energy to than force feeding myself. I even purged last night, something I've had a handle on recently, and I feel disgusting for doing it, but I couldn't focus knowing that I had eaten so much. 

I'm so tired and stressed right now. I have 2 exams next week, and my anxiety has been really bad so I end up wasting so much time panicking about stuff instead of actually studying, which just makes me more stressed. Its a viscous cycle. I feel like I am going to fail everything, not because its too hard but because I was lazy. I know that I am a smart person, so there is no excuse for me not doing well. 

This morning I ignored my alarm and slept through my Anatomy and Physiology lecture (which started at 11 how did I even do that). I've only missed one class this semester (I was in the hospital) and they are recorded and posted online but we have a test next week and I just feel like a piece of shit about not going. Attendance isn't even mandatory (but everyone goes) so I'm not in trouble, but if I do poorly on this exam I can only blame myself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you think that it would be helpful to let her experience the consequences of her actions by not forcing her out of bed? You could sit her down and explain that you will still wake her up (you could even ask how she wants you to do it), but she is more than old enough to do the rest on her own. If she misses the bus, charge her for the ride to school (my mom used to do this when I was in middle school).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, it would really throw a monkey wrench in my plans as my boyfriend and I are both in college and planning to pursue graduate degrees before settling down. While we aren't exactly ready for kids, I think we could make it work, though our paths to success would be a lot more challenging than they could have been otherwise. I consider myself to be pro-choice, but I am personally opposed to abortion so it would not be an option for me. 
I'd probably finish up this semester of school and either transfer to the college in my hometown so I can live with my parents (if they aren't in prison for the murder of me and/or my boyfriend) or transfer to the school my boyfriend is at and move in with him. Either way, I'm finishing my degree (I'm currently a freshman nursing student). I'd probably try to get myself back into treatment for my eating disorder because I can manage ok but there is no way I could have a healthy pregnancy eating like I am now, and I think I'd need a lot of support to be able to gain the weight I'd need to gain (I'm 10-15 pounds underweight right now) to have a healthy baby.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boobs. They are really big on my frame, to the point that I have people ask me if they are real with some regularity. I'm tall and pretty thin (5'8'' and about 120 lbs) with no hips and an otherwise kind of lanky, boyish body with 30F boobs. Even when I was super underweight with very low body fat they stayed about the same size (though thankfully they didn't grow when I gained weight). Some of this insecurity comes from my eating disorder, but a lot of it is because I can't dress the way that I want to and it is super hard to find clothes that fit. I feel like I have a frankenbody where the parts just don't make sense. I think that they hold me back from fully recovering from my eating disorder because I'm scared to gain weight or body fat because I don't want my chest to get any bigger.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even if they aren't aiming to work in an environment that requires professional dress, everyone has to navigate the world and learn that different things are different for different contexts, and that sometimes you just have to follow the rules. I agree that kids should be able to wear what makes them feel comfortable to a certain extent, which is why I support the idea of a clear and reasonable dress code that allows students to wear their own clothes and express their individuality in a way that is appropriate for the school environment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with school dress codes for the most part. 
I think its important for kids to learn that there is a time and place for everything, and school is not the time or place for your booty shorts and crop top or shirt with so much of the sides cut out that I can see your nipples. I have no problem with people wearing whatever they want out in the world but I think that kids should be taught that school is for learning and you need to dress with a certain level of professionalism and respect for the environment.

	<TEXT> Same here. My rule is that if I would wear it to bed, it doesn't leave the house and I make an effort to only wear workout clothes if I am coming directly from the gym or plan on going straight there after class. I'm in college so I dress pretty casually, but to me there is a huge difference between wearing leggings and a cute tunic or workout tights and a t-shirt and wearing sweats. Its not like it is hard to find comfortable, decent looking clothing these days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like kindergarten or first grade. I grew up in southern California, so most of the kids at my school were some combination of Asian and hispanic, which meant they were all super petite. I was far from fat but I was tall and muscular for my age so I felt H U G E, and like I stuck out. 
Looking back, I was a super skinny, athletic kid, but because my muscular legs were bigger than the other girls I thought I was fat.

	<TEXT> I've was in residential in Philly about a year ago. I've also been through all of their outpatient treatment programs if you have questions about that. 
Overall, I found residential to be a positive experience, but I also think that it will vary wildly depending on the dynamic of the community when you are there. I think one of the things that helped me the most was their emphasis on forming a community, I felt very safe and loved which I think helped me be comfortable enough to push myself. 

If you have any specific questions, please let me know!

I have friends who wear makeup to the gym for the same reason that I make a point to wear cute workout clothes; it makes them feel more confident, and they focus more on their workout because they aren't spending as much time worrying about insecurities.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't describe my experiences as 'racism' per se, but as a biracial female (half black, half white) I'd say that people seem to have more issues with my race. I have never had my womanhood questioned, but I am frequently told by other WOC that I'm "not black enough" or that I "act white". For starters, what the fuck does that even mean? I've heard the same things from my white friends ("oh you're basically white" and stuff like that) but it feels less hurtful because it doesn't feel like a rejection, and they have always been receptive to me telling them why comments like that are harmful.
The closest thing to racism that I have experienced is being stereotyped, sometimes by well meaning SJW types who want to hear about what I have "overcome." I was raised in a well off suburb by 2 married parents, my mom who retired from being a lawyer to be a SAHM and my dad who has a masters and manages a large division of a large company.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I second this. I would also recommend contacting the college of nursing or education at a school, a lot of them keep lists of students who are interested in childcare gigs. Even if there isn't an official program, a lot of professors would probably talk to students that they think would be qualified and put you in contact with them. I grew up in a college town, and most of my babysitters were elementary education majors that my mom was connected with through the school, and I know several families with children with special needs have found childcare by contacting the college of nursing at the university. </TEXT>

Obviously a few people don't get the grades or just choose to change majors I guess our culling comes during admissions and not in Medsurg.           </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BMI is a good estimate of health, especially when used with other indicators such as blood pressure and cholesterol. Someone with a BMI of 33 or a BMI of 12 is obviously going to be unhealthy, but there are some people who are one or 2 BMI points an unhealthy category who are in good health.

	<TEXT> If you're trying to lose weight the most important thing is to eat less. Obviously it is better if you eat healthier (and you'll probably feel less hungry since you get more volume for fewer calories with things like vegetables) but even eating smaller volumes of unhealthy foods will lead to weight loss. I'd suggest downloading My Fitness Pal (if you haven't already) and tracking what you eat. Cutting out liquid calories (soda, juice, Gatorade etc.)is a great way to lower your intake without feeling hungry, a lot of people don't realize how many calories they drink! 
Start making healthier substitutions, like skim milk instead of cream in your coffee and set nutritional goals (aim to eat a vegetable at every meal or something). You don't have to totally deprive yourself of junk, you just have to limit your servings and recognize that 200 calories of potato chips will leave you a lot less full than 200 calories of carrots an humus.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In elementary school gifted programs are usually focused on socialization and providing work that is appropriate for a students abilities. My school offered gifted instruction for math and language arts (some kids only did one, others did both) and "enrichment" classes that focused on a different topic each marking period (we got pulled from class for gifted).

In middle school the focus shifts more to enrichment and social support as classes start to be divided by levels and kids academic needs are hopefully being met more in a general classroom setting. 

I think the most valuable thing that I got out of the gifted program was the social and emotional support. I was very lucky to have awesome teachers who went above and beyond for me and helped me get through some difficult stuff. It was also cool to have an environment where I could be around other kids that were like me and not have to worry about seeming weird for being interested in things and excited about things and having interests nobody else my age cared about. My teachers always validated my interests and gave me resources to further my knowledge.  </TEXT>

I struggle with anorexia and compulsive exercise, and as dangerous as it is to not eat and overexercise, it is easy to delude yourself into thinking that you're being healthy, a lot of the things I do could be considered healthy if I did them in a less extreme way. 
When I stick my fingers down my throat, I am fully aware that what I am doing is disordered and super dangerous, but I do it anyway.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm super stressed right now because I have a whole bunch of exams and lab practicals right now. There is just a lot of information and I feel overwhelmed which is killing my motivation to study because if I won't know absolutely everything, what is the point of studying? School has always  been easy for me and now that I'm in college I'm still doing well, but having to really apply myself and struggling for the first time is making me question if I'm even smart enough or prepared for college. I also have ADHD so I'm getting worked up that I can't focus because I'm so anxious and have so much energy. 

I'm also struggling with my eating disorder, I lost some weight at the beginning of the semester which made me medically unstable so I'm still trying to get my electrolytes back in balance and such. All I want to do is run and not eat to deal with this stress, but the last thing I need is to pass out on a treadmill or something and end up back in the hospital. I know that I'm not eating enough and I'm not drinking the 2 Boost Pluses I'm supposed to have every day but at this point I don't have the mental energy left to make myself. I'm eating 3 meals and at least 1 snack and while I'm worried that my weight will be down at my doctors appointment next week I have too many other things to focus on to care about it. 


Wow. That was long... but it felt good. Back to studying the cardiovascular system now!

	<TEXT> Ugh. The reason so many people have trouble losing the weight after having a baby is because they gain more weight than they need to by not exercising and eating too much. Being in good shape has been shown to make delivery easier and women who exercise through out their pregnancies have been shown to recover faster after giving birth. 
Unless you are starting a pregnancy underweight or have a condition that causes excessive fluid retention, there is rarely a reason to gain any more than 25 pounds. 
Lets just say a person has gained 15 pounds by the day she delivers: 
About 7 of those pounds will be baby, 1-2 will be placenta and another 2 will be amniotic fluid. You also increase your blood volume during pregnancy, so that can account for a pound or 2 that you will basically pee out in the week or 2 following delivery. Assuming none of the 15 pound weight gain was attributed to fluid retention, that would leave her about 5 pounds away from her pre-baby weight, which is a pretty easy amount to lose. Heck, if you're starting at a healthy weight a 5 pound net gain isn't the end of the world.  </TEXT>

You don't have to justify yourself to anyone, even if you were at an unhealthy weight it would still be wrong for people to comment on it in the way that they are. I find just staring blankly at people or asking them to clarify what they mean (so they realize how rude and invasive they are being) to be a good way of dealing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with other posters that medication is often supremely helpful, and can help other non pharmaceutical therapies be more effective. My parents had the same concerns as you and did not start me on medication until I was 11 and it became clear that my inability to focus and difficulties with executive functioning were holding me back and they have both said they regret not doing it sooner (I also wish that they had done it sooner). My personality did not change, but it really reduced my anxiety and improved my mood because I was able to perform at the level that was expected of me, and I felt more in control, so it greatly reduced the amount of frustration and emotional outbursts I had as a result. 
I also think that the medication really helped me learn to apply the skills that I had learned in CBT and OT because I actually had the focus to implement systems and make longer term plans. 

The great thing about ADHD meds is that they work from the first dose, unlike a lot of other drugs that need a week or 2 to build up in your system, so you can try them for a short period of time and know how they make your kid feel. Your son also doesn't have to take the meds every day, he can just take them on days when he has school or some other activity where he needs that extra support. Worst case scenario, the meds don't work or your son doesn't like them so you stop using them with no longterm consequences, I really think you have a lot to gain and nothing to lose from giving meds a shot.   </TEXT>

I struggle on the opposite end of the spectrum (anorexia), and I truly think the best way to go about this is to not say anything until you know the situation.

	<TEXT> I thought it was well done and quite clearly the best out of all of the recent live TV musicals. The tech was great, the energy was good and while I think that there are people who could have played a lot of the roles better, I think that they did a good job of picking capable performers for the roles. I've never been a fan of Vanessa Hudgen's voice but I actually enjoyed her performances a lot, she had really good presence, she is a great example of an actor who sings in my opinion. 

I honestly wasn't a big fan of Aaron Tveit as Danny though, I thought he looked way too old, even compared to the rest of the cast. Its not that he was bad or anything, he is clearly a talented guy, I just really don't get the hype about his performance. Honestly, we need to let the poor man start playing adults, its getting weird.

	<TEXT> I'm currently a college student and I need to start building a more 'professional' wardrobe. Right now I have basically nothing, I've been getting by borrowing stuff from friends or improvising for the few times I have needed to be dressed up this year, but next year I start clinical rotations and I will need to be dressed business professional at least twice every week, plus I will have more formal presentations and opportunities to shadow. 

Right now I wear a kind of "uniform": black, grey or blue skinny jeans, a solid or striped t-shirt, an oversized cardigan, a scarf (sometimes) and converse, vans or LLBean boots for shoes. 

I'm basically clueless so I am open to any suggestions. I'm about 5'8'' and 120 pounds with no hips or butt and big boobs (30E). I have a pretty narrow waist (24 inches) and I'm pretty evenly porportioned (my legs are on the long side but its not extreme). I tend to wear oversized clothes but I know that won't fly in this setting so I need guidance to what would actually look good on me when fitted properly. 
How many pieces do you guys think I will need and what are some suggestions? The only thing I'm not open to are tight skirts, or skirts that hit above the knee (these are just preferences, not a religious thing).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BMI is a good way to estimate if a person is at a good weight, but it isn't the whole picture. There are very few (if any) people who are healthy at the extreme ends (over 30 or under 16), but there are plenty of people who are just fine a bit above or below what is considered "healthy" on a BMI chart. If somebody feels well and is living a healthy lifestyle, most doctors aren't too concerned about a BMI of 26 or 17, especially if your weight has been stable.

	<TEXT> My mom did too, and even as somebody who struggles with an eating disorder I never found it insulting or stressful.
If something didn't look good, she always phrased it as a problem with the garment (that really isn't cut well for your shape) rather than something wrong with my body (your butt is too flat to pull that off), and she was good at keeping her mouth shut unless I asked for her advice or something looked REALLY terrible. She also always made a point to tell me if a certain style or garment looked really good on me so I never felt like she was picking on me.  </TEXT>
