Positives:
+ Has a ring to it.
+ Fits in with Foley's desired military theme.
+ I don't think it's trademarked.
+ Nothing to do with gambling, meaning it fits the rule they've set forward.

Negatives:
- Name isn't really specific to LV... ie. it could probably be used by anyone. 


Random other names I think sound ok: Vipers, Venom, Vectors, Invincibles, Mammoths, Villains, Engineers, Vintage...

I also like Flamingos a lot. Aces would have been ideal for the double meaning of a winning card and of a skilled pilot (which has a military context and fits in with the air bases in the area as well).

	<TEXT> Vehicle Inspection Regulations specifically say that a tester or vehicle inspector must not knowingly issue a rejection sticker for a vehicle that should be approved. (17-3-b of the vehicle inspection regulations made under subsection 201(7) of the motor vehicle act). So a tech who violates that part of the act would be committing a category G offense, under the summary proceedings act. According to that act, if this is the first time they've made that offense, a judge would fine them at least $500. The second time would be $1000, and every time after that $2000.

In terms of the rotors, most techs will recommend rotors at the same time as pads... it makes for a more "complete" brake job, as the old rotors will have often been affected by the old pads, even if they are still plenty thick. That said, technically, if the rotors didn't fail MVI, and that wasn't specified, it still sounds like a category G offense to me. 

As I think you mentioned, or someone else did, The Official Inspection Station manual says that pads fail MVI if they have less than OEM specifications or 2/32(1.6mm) where OEM spec is not available. So if OEM spec isn't more than the 2mm they measured at, than this would also be a Category G offense on its own. Since it sounds like they back tracked to 1.6mm, without apparently checking OEM spec (not sure if their system has that kind of information listed in it, but there's a high likelihood that it does), than it sounds like either way they made a mistake, even if legally it's not clear if on this particular issue they made an offense. 

Although you've made it clear that your willingness to replace the pads was never the issue... I'd also point out, as an aside and a separate issue, that the MVI standards are extremely low, and a lot of vehicles can and do pass MVI that present a poor standard for safety. A new brake pad usually has about 12mm (1.2cm) of pad on it... it will ware down to about 3mm before a metal sensor in the pad becomes exposed and contacts your rotor/drum to make a squealing noise to indicate it's time to replace the pads. On some newer vehicles this also triggers the display of a warning light electronically. If that's any indication of OEM specs, on most vehicles it would probably be safe to say that by 2mm you're already beyond what the car or pad manufacturer intended. 

It's scary to think that someone could pass MVI with 1.7mm of pad, as one example of the low standards set by MVI. If someone let their pad get to that point in the first place, my confidence in their taking responsibility for the safety of their own vehicle is already pretty low. Many people simply don't pay much attention to their cars, and will get the issue fixed once they're made aware of it (ie. not negligent, just oblivious). Others are quite willing to risk the safety of the rest of us, in order to save money. The end effect is that MVI, which could be a great measure to keep our roads safe, isn't much more than a bi-annual tax.  </TEXT>
