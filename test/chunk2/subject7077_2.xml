This is the kind of guy who doesn't have an SO, or thinks that it's cool to be cold and logical towards loved ones. He probably watches House and wants to be just like House.

Wow. They really need to get some gun control whenever that was at.. oh wait. Paris. It's almost as if criminals don't care if guns are illegal to have or not.

	<TEXT> Yeah, but I still don't understand why people get tattoos. I too like the design of it, but I'm left thinking that people generally get tattoos because they think they're afraid they'll somehow forget what the tattoo represents. Tattooing your blood type, for instance, might make sense.

This is why I have my banking account number and password on my forearm. It's a pain in the ass when I have to reset the password though for security reasons. I'm running out of forearm space. 

Have you considered that the person with the tattoo probably got it because they like it and not because they give a shit what you think?

This is how I feel though. They showed their tattoos to what they felt would be like-minded individuals who might enjoy it. As a guy with a few tattoos, if you don't like someone's tattoo, then shutup and don't say anything. They got it for themselves, not so you can endlessly criticize them. 

Or be mature and say, "I'm not a fan of tattoos/that tattoo, but it's cool you got something that matters to you" or some shit like that.  </TEXT>

I'd like a Keldeo, ideally below level 50 and not in its resolute form yet. I don't care if it's clone or genned. In fact I'd prefer it that way in most cases.

FT I have:

Shiny Deoxys, Shiny Jirachi, Shiny and Normal Phione, Hoopa, Genesect, Celebi, Shaymin, Darkrai, Shiny Mew, Terrakion, Virizion, Reshiram, Arceus, Xerneas, Heatran, Shiny Entei and Raikou, Suicune. Most cloned/genned.

Breedjects are Staryu, Dratini, Bulbasaur, Kangaskhan, and Honedge. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is exactly what it sounds like! A Redditor in /r/movies has decided to sue Warner Bros. for showing scenes in the Suicide Squad trailer that did not show up in the movie. 

[Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4wq2iy/my_brother_who_is_a_lawyer_and_i_are_going_to_sue/?sort=controversial) is the overall thread (sorted by controversial for your enjoyment). 

There is even an [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/suicide-squad-fan-suing-studio-false-advertising-lack-of-joker-scenes-jared-leto-warner-bros-a7180231.html) in the news about it.

*DRAMA BEGINS HERE*: 

[Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4wq2iy/my_brother_who_is_a_lawyer_and_i_are_going_to_sue/d68z1u8) is one user comparing the trailer to cereal advertised with chocolate chips that then doesn't come with chocolate chips.

[Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4wq2iy/my_brother_who_is_a_lawyer_and_i_are_going_to_sue/d68yqqe) is OP defending himself by comparing it to advertising burgers.

[Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4wq2iy/my_brother_who_is_a_lawyer_and_i_are_going_to_sue/d690q3k) OP is being called a "whiny brat". (This is a slightly longer chain than the others). 

In a brief comment [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4wvcvm/suicide_squad_fan_suing_studio_for_false/d6a6vnu) OP states that he thinks it's silly too, but wanted to share his frustration with others. 

[OP](https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4wq2iy/my_brother_who_is_a_lawyer_and_i_are_going_to_sue/d69fy29) defends himself as does another Redditor who calls everyone "dense". 

There isn't one giant mega drama thread, except that last one I posted. A lot of this is snack drama but I figured all of it added up would be pretty enjoyable.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have both Banner Saga games downloaded, and I have completed Banner Saga 1. I can see the save, and then play it so it plays the cutscenes, etc. 

Yet when I go to start a new game on Banner Saga 2 and hit "Import Save from BS1" (or whatever it says), it says no memory of BS1 can be found on my system?

I've tried taking the memory from the PS servers and uploading it to my console, since I know as a PS+ member the memory sometimes gets stored there instead of the system. Still no luck.

Any help? </TEXT>

Any suggestions?

	<TEXT> My girlfriend recently got a Wii U and is loving it. She has played through all of Pokken Tournament and Pikmin 3 (plus the DLC for it). I think she really enjoyed the exploration of Pikmin as well as its ease of play.

To be more specific, she loves that she can play both games entirely with the Wii U controller and not use a TV. 

She's not really a hardcore gamer. By that I mean the games she enjoyed before the Wii U were things like Flower and Journey on the PS4.

Any suggestions I could give her? </TEXT>
