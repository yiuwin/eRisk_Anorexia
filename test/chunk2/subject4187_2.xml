	<TEXT> Yeah, I also have that effect when I smoke bud, but not to the point where I start to see things like on acid. It's usually when I smoke a predominantly sativa strain and I get more of a 'mind' high instead of a 'stoned body' high. 

It's does feel like a acid trip sometimes when my set and setting really messes with me and I start to get uncomfortable and paranoid, but not that often. 

I've been smoking for about a year no break.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're doing good by going to pubs and talking to course-mates to be more extroverted I would say, that helps you pick up on social ques and what not. Concerning your flatmates, you should just hang around your flatmates more often, you've only been there 2 weeks. The more you hang with them the more memories you will make with them which mean you'll have more things to refer to if you are trying to make jokes/engage with them. Also if you aren't able to follow the conversation if there is one between them ask questions, if they want you around then i'm sure they will try their best to include you in; then once you're in the conversation it isn't hard to add to the conversation just say whatever is on your mind that has to do with whatever you guys are talking about.

I wasn't very extroverted before college either so I know how you feel, but being in a flat with other people was the best thing to happen to me while trying to be more extroverted because you would always have people to be around and they could help you meet even more friends by becoming friends with their friends. Best of luck man! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see the comment. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you need to have a license to know what those three peddles do. That's common sense. And if your referring to the joke about women driving that's also a pretty common thing to joke about. Sorry I don't see the bs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are trying to WILD then yeah you will have to encounter SP at some point because that is part of the process but if you are trying to DILD (Dream Induced Lucid Dream) or any variation of becoming lucid by realizing you're in a dream then you most likely won't have to deal with it. (I say "most likely" because its different for everyone).

Avoid sleeping on your back because that is the most common way I hear that SP will occur.

One more thing before I go, stop (if your friend is) reading posts and stuff about how sleep paralysis is "so fucking scary". If you feed your mind with that kind of stuff it will be 100times worst because you'll be expecting it to be scary and it will freak you out. Most people who have SP the first time think that they are being possessed or some shit because they don't know what is happening to them but you know that isn't true, you know that it is just something your body does NATURALLY when you sleep and not anything supernatural. So no need to worry man, best of luck to your 'friend' lol.

EDIT: Also get a cheap sleeping mask and maybe listen to some calm music if you are trying to WILD and don't want anything to do with the creepy hallucinations.
