	<TEXT> I mean.  Reread it.

Guy has sex with girlfriend.  A funny sound breaks the mood.   She then:

A. Pushes him away because the sound turned consensual sex into unwanted sex/rape.

B.  Pushes him to reposition away from the mood breaking sound (and presumably continue having consensual sex)

Given that he told the story, and the girlfriends major concern is not talking about the noise -  the sex is consensual and his crime is telling Reddit about the episode.

Alternately, op is self incriminating and describing a rape where something funny happened... You want this to be rape but it's really just poor word choice on ops part </TEXT>
