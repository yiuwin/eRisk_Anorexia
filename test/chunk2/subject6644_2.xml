	<TEXT> My parents and I went to Florida for my brother's college graduation. We were sharing a room. 

First, in order to get to the room, you had to walk through a door which lead you to another hallway with another door at the end. This door was much smaller and the following hallway even smaller. It felt like Alice in Wonderland. Trippy. 

Next we get to the room. There's a couch and then a door that folds in the middle of the room like an accordion to block the room with the bed. However, once closed it would not open unless you jiggled the whole door and made a lot of noise. 

Lastly, there were no windows. There was a half window that didn't open in the bathroom right below the ceiling. Pointless. 

It was really sketchy,  but we were just there to sleep so it did the trick just fine. 0/5 stars though. Would never go back.  </TEXT>
