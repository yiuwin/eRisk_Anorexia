	<TITLE> Would you have liked H4:"Dawn" as a hectic CQB level? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-22 08:40:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've just had a pondering thought since Halo 4 of, what if 343 had kept the original *Dawn* design and, instead, had made "Dawn" less of an "open floorplan" level, and, instead, made it a more hectic and intense CQB map, where you have to fight the Remnant off in the tighter, smaller corridors of the traditional *Charon*-class design? (think along the lines of H1:"The Pillar of Autumn", but more cramped)

I think that it'd've made for one hell of a level, trying to fight off the Remnant in short, tight corridors. 

And, as for the Hyperion launch sub-mission, they could have revised that into the Chief launching a fuck-ton of M42 Archers at the cruiser instead, which, IMHO, would have been a more impressive sight, (plus, probably more pants-shitting for the Remnant aboard) seeing a fuckton of missiles flying at them, especially with their shields down.

What do you think? Do you like the idea of a hectic, CQB first-mission better, or do you think "Dawn" was better as-is?

(Disclaimer: That is not to say I didn't like "Dawn", I did. But I, personally, think it might have been a better re-introduction if the Chief was, from the get-go, overwhelmed with Remnant forces in close quarters, versus the more "open floorplan" of the level as it exists.) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am considering, to start, just getting like a 1/10 of a Bitcoin, just as a personal investment, since BTC is on the rise at the moment. Since it'll only be ~$41, if BTC crashes, I won't be out too badly, I figure.

As for wallets, I am looking at Blockchain, Green Address and Hive, because they are only three that bitcoin.org says are multi-platform (mobile, computer and web).

Any of you have any personal experience with any of those? Thoughts?

Or do you recommend another wallet? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What would you think of a Remastering of the Animated Series? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-13 22:31:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As far as I can figure, it might actually be easier (and cheaper) than the remasters of TOS and TNG.

Especially since there are only 8-9 hours of episodes (22 half-hour episodes at 22-24 minutes each), if CBS Digital took the DVD versions, [touched up the episodes](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Animated_Series#Production_inconsistencies), including coloring issues [e.g.](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20061209064958/memoryalpha/en/images/thumb/3/39/Chapel_operations_uniform.jpg/185px-Chapel_operations_uniform.jpg) [and maybe (especially on the Tribbles) did some de-pinking], as well as doing edits on reused footage to remove people who aren't supposed to be there and correcting any other errors present.


Or, alternatively, since there are only 22 eps and 8-9 hrs, what about going through and completely reanimating them on computer? They keep the audio as-is (maybe run it through a filter or whatever and high-def it), but reanimate all 22 episodes.

The classic TAS would still be a "legacy" version, but TAS-R would, either way, just be an update, a la, TOS-R.


And maybe they could even release TAS-R as a double-set, as such:

* discs 1-2: TAS-R
* discs 3-4: TAS classic
* disc 5: assorted special features


r/StarTrek, what do you folks think? </TEXT>

In the interest of full disclosure, she also has a special-diet dog that she adores and would hate to have to get rid of, so dog-lovers/dog-toleraters are a big plus.

Please, Reddit, can anyone help her out?

	<TEXT> Right now, I have a 2009 HP Pavilion dv6 that came with Vista, but I updated to 7.

Since it's 5 years old, it's getting a little long in the tooth, and I was wanting suggestions as to brands.

I love my HP and am favoring getting another one, but I also heard Asus (...or was it Acer?) and Lenovo were the top-of-the-line laptops. Any truth to this?

Any suggestions?

It would be mostly for internetting, school stuff, "light" gaming (Civilization, Star Trek Online (if it has enough RAM and a good CPU and such) and maybe some others).

And I'd also need it to have a CD drive, a 10-key and at least a 15.6" screen.

Touchscreen would also be fun, but it's not mandatory.

	<TEXT> One of mine is in X-Men III, in the [opening sequence in the Danger Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxWXxa2nDPw). Colossus and Wolverine invent (in Earth-10005) the Fastball Special and Wolverine decapitates a what is, quite obviously, a Sentinel. There's also this one interesting bit of dialogue:
 Storm: "We're getting killed out here!"
 Wolverine: "Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm."

What with how Earth-10005 ends up in DOFP, it's kind of interesting how it all unintentionally tied together nicely.



So, r/movies, what's your favorite instance of retroactive foreshadowing (that is foreshadowing that was unintentional, but still works)? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hey Reddit, ever been at a show taping where an animated character "showed up"? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-04 08:44:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was wondering if any of you have been to a taping of a television program (game show, sitcom, etc.) where an animated character appeared with live action actors.

How did they do it?
Were you told ahead of time that Person A was standing in for the animated character and told to cheer when they showed up? Or was a cardboard cutout brought out? Or what?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I got no replies over on r/BF, so I'll try here.

On my Battlelog, currently it says I'm 96,850 XP from leveling up. However, to level up, I need 4,250,000 and I have 4,156,913 XP, meaning I still need 91,087 XP to rank up.

And, when adding all of the MP Score sections in StatsDetails, there are 109,929 XP unaccounted for.

Because I'm a total nut, I want some help figuring this out.

	<TITLE> What would you think of Star Wars "Deluxe Editions"? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-29 09:03:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was looking through the [Scenes cut from Star Wars](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Scenes_cut_from_Star_Wars) page on Wookieepedia and I got to thinking:

What if they released a Deluxe Edition of all six movies, with all the deleted scenes put back in?

(I'll mention some of the scenes below for those to lazy to link and/or for those who can't for whatever reason)

Among others:


**Episode I**

* Anakin's fist-fight with Greedo

* extended duels on Tatooine and in the Theed Generator Complex

* extended space Battle of Naboo 


**Episode II**

* Obi-Wan visiting the Temple analysis room (explaining his visit to Dex)

* meeting Padme's family (instead of their first appearance being her funeral procession, where, in effect, they're just "random people")

* C-3PO getting his plating

* Anakin and Padme are brought to Dooku, then put on trial (instead 
of just being shipped off for execution)

* Ki-Adi-Mundi, Plo Koon and Aayla Secura raiding a Droid Control Ship (explaining why they're being escorted in to the circle of survivors)


**Episode III**

* Shaak Ti's death at the hands of Grievous on the *Invisible Hand* (she later appears as a hologram, but, because she just sits there, it'd be easy enough to replace her with [Tsui Choi](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Tsui_Choi), as was the original plan). That scene would lead to...

* An extended sequence of Anakin and Obi-Wan on the *IH*, showing more of their bro-ness and having a sign language discussion over their next move, after being surrounded by battle droids.

* More proto-Rebel scenes with Bail, Mothma, Padme, etc., one of which even makes mention of the creation of the sector governors, aka Moffs.

* conversations between Aayla Secura   Bly, and Plo Koon   Jag

* an extended Jedi Purge and Order 66, with the deaths of Luminara Unduli, Whie, Bene, Cin Drallig, and Shaak Ti (who could, perhaps, be digitally replaced with someone else, if the scene was filmed. If not, she could die on the *IH*), (as well Barriss Offee, who could probably be cut out easily enough, per *Clone Wars*)

* the clones disguised as Jedi, explaining the brown-cloaked figures during that one shot on Utapau

* a longer Anakin-Obi-Wan duel


**Episode IV**

* Luke seeing the overhead battle on Tatooine while repairing a moisture vaporator

* Luke meeting up with Biggs, Camie, Deak, Windy and Fixer at Tosche Station

* Luke and Biggs talking on Tatooine

* a Luke-3PO conversation while hunting for R2 (with some help from CGI)

* Cantina patron leaving to report to the stormtroopers

* Biggs, Luke and Red Leader have a longer conversation, where Red Leader mentions knowing Anakin (could have met during offscreen portion of the Clone Wars)

**Episode V**

* C-3PO removes a sign from the Wampa storage room as they evac Echo Base

* General Veers' death

* Wampas escaping and rampaging through Echo Base

* a scene where Lobot has dialogue


**Episode VI**

* Luke tinkering with his lightsaber

* The gang returning to their ships amidst a sandstorm on Tatooine, after the skirmish at Carkoon

* an expansion of Moff Jerjerrod's story

* more scenes with Madine and, supposedly, B-Wing pilots


Honestly, especially with the success of the 3-4 hour long extended cuts of LOTR, I think that an Extended/Deluxe Edition of all six movies would be lots of fun and much awesomeness. And, considering the Great Canon Reset, it would allow for them the freedom to put scenes back in, freeing them up to kill people who survived otherwise (e.g. Shaak Ti and the *TFU* series).

But, that's just, like, my opinion, man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> South Park is, primarily (minus the animators), a two-man operation. Trey and Matt do the bulk of the writing, producing and VO work.
With a team of under 100, South Park is cranked out in a week.

The Simpsons, Family Guy, SpongeBob and others, which have lots of VO actors, huge teams of animators and storyboarders, etc. takes up to a year to make a 22 minute episode.

tl;dr: Why is a team of under 100 able to make an episode in a week while a team of hundreds take a year to make an episode? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> DAE have the issue where you are playing a match and you change your loadout (soldier and vehicle), then you change to another gametype and the loadout is what it was, not what it "is"?

For example, I decided to do a live-fire testing in Conquest of the Attack Jet with the Extinguisher and JDAM. I quickly decided that they don't fit my style and switched them out for ECM and Laser Guided. I also got a MiniRDS for my 1911 and hooked that on (swapping out Ghost Ring).

I went to play TDM to break in my MiniRDS, but it still had the Ghost Ring attached.

Then I went back to CQ and got in an Attack Jet, but it was still equipped with the Extinguisher and JDAM.

What's going on?! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the new DTs for...DT is in the "exclusives" category and is called "4th Floor". The text says "Dog Tag Awarded to 4th floor participants" PNG of the tag pulled from Battlelog

My reader can't get a grab of the QR Code, alas. The gold thing is common on security passcards for office buildings (in the US at least)

As for the dates, 20131029 12:00:00 obviously refers to noon on BF4 launch day.

The other one, 21420612 17:00:00 draws a bit more interest. It refers to 5 PM on June 12, 2142.

Disclaimer: the following may be wild speculation, or the following may be "on to something". It remains to be seen.

2142 was when BF2142 was set, obviously. And June 12 was the final day of E3 this year.

In BF3 and BF4, DICE has thrown in BF2142 Easter Eggs on MP maps. As well, "Carrier Assault" could perhaps be considered not-an-Easter-Egg Easter Egg.

Plus, under Rogue Transmission, a crate under the map has 2143 written on it.

For BF3 (released October '11), DICE released the DLC packs in the following manner: * CQ: June 2012 * AK: September 2012 * AM: December 2012 * EG: March 2013

However, DICE is fast-tracking the DLC for BF4, with Final Stand due out "Summer", so probably August or September.

Now, this could just be "because" or....

maybe they are hauling ass through BF4 DLC launches so they can get the dev teams over to...

working on a BF2142 HD remake as prep for "2143". Perhaps the "17" means the first news of 2142HD and/or 2143 is coming July 17 (since DT comes out on July 15 and 4th floor is a DT dogtag)?

21420612 17:00:00

Or maybe you read it backwards as "7/12 16" as in "July 12 at 4 PM"?

Only DICE knows......for now..........

	<TITLE> Gareth Edwards' stand-alone -- Boba Fett? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-23 06:20:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It was rumored that one of the stand-alones would be focused on Boba Fett. Especially with his rabid fanbase, and his escape from the Sarlaac now Legends-canon, I think that it would make the most sense to do the first one based on Boba Fett and telling his story starting with his escape from the sarlaac pit. Then maybe jumping to c. 20 ABY, or even jumping ahead to meet the movies in 30 ABY, and they can bring back Temuera Morrison as adult Boba (since he was an unaltered clone of Jango, he would end up looking identical to his dad, save for some scars or something) and we can see what Boba's been doing in the interim following his escape from the sarlaac pit.

I dunno. Just my two cents. Do with it what you will. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Calling it right now: five predictions for Episode VII </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-01 06:01:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Prediction #1: Max von Sydow will be playing the main villain.

Prediction #2: Andy Serkis will be doing mo-cap for a character who will either be an adorable asskicker (think Rocket Raccoon) or a love-to-hate alien guy (think Gollum, except with a not tragic backstory). He will also be amazing in the role and will not receive an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor because the Academy are a bunch of jerk-heads.

Prediction #3: There will be a Chewie-on-Sernpidal scale death of a major (not of the "core three") character. I'd say either Chewie or R2. Maybe Lando if they want to be extra cruel. And they will die either off-screen heroically or on-screen without a fight (think Tasha Yar in TNG)

Prediction #4: An character who appeared exclusively in the prequel trilogy, *The Clone Wars* cartoon or *Rebels* will reappear in the movie, alive and in person.

Prediction #5: The reason Billy Dee Williams isn't on the cast list is because, while he does appear, Lando is a secondary character in the film. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-04-30 06:24:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Going in to tonight's episode I knew Jim Rash was playing a TV exec who would offer Rachel a gig, that gig, as it turned out was *Song of Solomon* (which, as a sci-fi fan, caused me physical pain); once that audition was done, I had written off the storyline.

Then she got a call from Dean Pelton's alter-ego and two of the most magical words in Hollywood came out of his mouth: "development deal".

When I heard about the whole "TV executive offer's Rachel a gig" thing, that was when my theory was fomented, and the two Magic Words cemented it.

I'm gonna call it right now: Rachel will take the development deal and relocate to LA (which is why the show won't be NYC-exclusive, per many comments from RM).
The executive producer put in charge of it all will be one Ryan Murphy (as himself), or, if RM really wanted to mess with our heads, it'll be Bryan Collins (Andrew Rannells), and her development deal show will evolve to be high school student Rachel Berry or other "knockoff name", e.g. Mindy Kaling/Mindy Lahiri (played by Rachel Berry) who joins her high school Glee club and wants to leave her small Ohio town so she can fulfill her Broadway dreams.

Sound familiar?


The tl;dr version is that Rachel will (possibly immediately, but, if not, soon) leave Funny Girl to take the development deal and move to LA, where the Executive Producer of the project, the played-by-himself  Ryan Murphy (as introduced in the closing bits of the final episode), or, if he wanted to get really twisty, Bryan Collins (Andrew Rannells) will helm an autobiographical show about her, ending the show on a recursive note (along the lines of the Arrested Development final scene). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My solution to the EU conflict </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-28 06:22:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To borrow four (very important) words from Doctor Who: fixed point in time

Or points, in this case.


Basically, it's that the EU-verse and the movie-verse are parallel timelines. But, unlike most parallel timelines that branch off from a point and progress separately in perpetuity, these two timelines reintersect in (at least) six places (possibly seven, depending on how *Rebels* plays in to the "true" EU novels).

The split begins in 32BBY (or earlier, depending on how the 7/8/9 play out), as soon as the closing credits of Ep I roll.
Then the EU-timeline carries on in its own way, while the movie-verse carries on in its own way, only to reintersect ten years later in 22BBY, both of which then proceed to carry on independently following the iris in.
Then in 19BBY they reintersect again. Repeat.
Then in 0BBY/ABY. Repeat.
Then in 3 ABY. Repeat.
Then in 4 ABY.

4ABY is the final reintersection of the timelines. From there on out, they are true parallel timelines.

Assuming the Vong don't pop up in 7/8/9, it can be argued that in the movie timeline, the civil war they had during their time in intergalactic space destroyed them, instead of allowing Onimi to come to power, which means no YV War, [](/s "thus why Peter Mayhew will be playing Chewie, since he didn't die at Sernpidal").



The tl;dr version is that the EU and movie timelines are parallel timelines, except for Episodes I, II, III, IV, V and VI, all of which exist as fixed points in time (meaning they must occur and cannot be changed), shared between the two universes. VII, VIII and IX, however, are not fixed points in time and thus exist in true parallel to the EU-verse timeline.

	<TITLE> Theory about Rorke </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-13 22:05:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the opening cutscene to Hunted, Elias says to Rorke that "You taught me a long time ago - Ghosts don't break".

And even during my initial playthrough, I had been wondering if, perhaps, the Federation never did torture Rorke.

And by that I mean, what if, after being captured, he willingly, or even joyfully, joined the Federation (perhaps even during the mission in Venezuela he was in cahoots with them?).


His hatred of Elias especially is not exactly something that could be ingrained. Well, it could, but why would the Feds know about Elias and such without Rorke going them up?
That's a natural hatred.
Plus, why is Rorke only really working against the Ghosts and not against the entire US? With Rorke's mind, he could very easily make a plan to invade and conquer the US. But, instead, he is working as a counter-Ghost operative.

Plus, if Rorke really is as Rorke-ish as the flashbacks make him seem and how everyone makes him sound, he would rather have died than given up the secrets and members of the Ghosts, maybe be ODing on the poisonous food they supposedly have him during his time in the hole.

And, again, as loyal as Rorke seemed to the Ghosts and the US, wouldn't the Feds keeping him in a deep, dark hole drive him to hate and fight the Fed whenever he got the chance, even formulating Escape Plans A through K?

All of that, in my mind at least, points to an intentional alliance/union with the Federation.

This could possibly play in to his seemingly unnatural obsession with Logan (over Hesh) somehow or other.

	<DATE> 2014-04-13 08:29:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Teaser, not trailer!**

My thought is that, since they are still early in shooting and still haven't finished casting it yet, I'm saying NO EARLIER THAN August (attached to Guardians).

More likely, Big Hero 6 in November (possibly Into the Woods in December, but it's a "smaller film" [vs. BH6, a non-MCU Marvel comic movie]), allowing for footage shooting, casting, as well as putting it in at a one year (13 month, but close enough) lead time before release.

As far as a full-on trailer, I'm gonna say Age of Ultron.


Note: all of the above is assumed that they will pair the initial teaser and trailer only with a Disney-owned movie, and not "outsource" it, as it were. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I saw the "Mass Effect x Battlefield" video and it got me to thinking:
that could work quite well.

Set it during the Reaper War, and have the PC be part of a multi-species elite force (Spectres?) that planet-hop, so they hit Palaven, Thessia, Earth, etc., while Shep and co. are off being big damn heroes, these guys are the more down-in-the-dirt heroes.
And, perhaps, it can link to your ME3 save file, implementing changes to the military forces as they occur (e.g. Leviathan forces, Geth forces, etc.)
Maybe even a mission or two as a pilot/PC piloting in space combat against Reaper forces.
And maybe even the Reaper takeover of the Citadel.

And the MP maps are already built in (for lack of a better term): Thessia, Palaven, Earth, Kahje, Sur'Kesh, even Khar'shan.

And the ME-prime folks can maybe cameo on some missions, like Garrus at Palaven, Balak (and Charn?) on Khar'shan, etc. And maybe even a Shepard cameo at one point.

And, for this, I think FPS-with-RPG-elements (e.g. Fallout 3   NV) could work. Sort of Battlefield-style, for weapons and armor and whatnots.

So, it's a way of continuing ME-prime, but without Shepard. Thoughts?



ADDENDUM: Is there a way for me to post a link to an Excel file I made to track this theoretical game's gameplay whatnots (guns, powers, classes, etc)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is it that when Americans protest, protestors come out for a few hours and then leave, while in Europe, Asia and Africa, even in the democratic countries (e.g. Britain, Greece...), they have a habit of turning into full-fledged riots? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My "optimal" 2014-15 TV schedule. Your thoughts? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-09 08:27:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I built an optimal-from-my-perspective TV schedule for next season and was wanting your opinion on it. 

A few notes:

*single dash means the preceding show is 30 minutes, equals is one hour, two equals is two hours

*chart runs from 8/7C to 10/9C, from left to right for the September 2014 to May 2015 season.

*Fox and CW only run two hours per night; ABC, NBC, CBS run 3.

*all caps indicate an "open slot"

*(N) indicates a new show [either straight-to-series or judged to be 'likely to be picked up'], (m) means 
midseason switch, (13) means a 13 episode season [either due to it being a new pickup, or how it's produced]

*I apologize in advance for any formatting errors; I'm changing it from an Excel spreadsheet to text for posting

Almost Human then runs from January 21 to June 3, with a two hour season opening and closing, and Backstrom running January 28 to April 22, allowing an opening for up to 5 more episodes to be ordered. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do I [22 M] make friends? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-09 02:20:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Right now, I really only have two friends, and they are just IM friends, one lives thousands of miles away (I met them here on Reddit) and the other lives in town (we dated once and decided we're better off as friends, though we haven't seen each other face-to-face in probably six months or more), and I keep in semi-regular contact with both of them (both females). That's about the length of my friends list.

Really, since about 2nd or 3rd grade, I haven't had friends. I wanted friends but, due to extenuating familial circumstances, no one wanted to be my friend (or was allowed to by their parents). So, I just kind of drifted, asocial, through the rest of elementary, middle and the first half of high school being pretty much friendless, and any friends I did make, ended up drifting away because I stopped wanting to socialize, because I have no idea how TO socialize with people my own age.

Then, between sophomore and junior year, we moved halfway across the country to here, giving me a renewed opportunity to make friends. But, because, by the time you're 16, you already have your own tight-knit little circle of friends and you've known most of your classmates for years, it becomes hard for this new kid to work his way in. Again, I also really had no idea how to socialize or talk with people my own age. Teachers and administrators? I could talk to them for ages, but not people my own age.

Plus, I'm not religious, athletic or musically-talented, so I couldn't join a church group thing, team or band, which killed 80% of high school socialization options, so, I was pretty much limited to whatever class time the teacher wasn't lecturing to talk to the people at the desks around mine, all of whom, as I mentioned, all had their own circle of friends.

And, now that I'm in college, again, because people went their separate ways after high school, more opportunities arose...back in 2009 when I started (tl;dr: I fucked up my first two years, so I'm a little ways behind in my hours), so, now, they all have their Bachelor's degrees and stuff and I'm just sitting here ~~masturbating~~ still working on my Bachelor's. And, again, like high school, the only chances I have to talk to people are in class or immediately before or after. And, again, I tend to associate better with the professors than I do with my classmates.

And, unfortunately, I've never had a job, so I've never had coworkers to associate with.

So, Reddit, how do you suggest I go about making friends and actually having people to talk to and go do things with?

	<TITLE> Abrams-verse "Schrdinger paradox" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-07 05:00:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A little while ago, I realized that the Abrams-verse is kind of an application of Schrdinger's Cat.

In 2373, the Ent-E went back to 2063 to ensure the launch of the Phoenix occurred as it was supposed to, to ensure timeline continuity, which they did.

However, in 2387, when Hobus went kablooey, it spawned the Abrams-verse timeline, which is identical to the prime timeline, up until January 4, 2233 (2233.04).

After that, it's all in flux, meaning that the Battle of Sector 001, that culminated in the Ent-E going back to 2063 never happened, and, yet, it did, because the timelines were identical until the arrival of the Narada. 

If the Abrams-verse crew went back to 2063, they'd encounter Picard and co. as we know them, meaning that the prime Ent-E and all aboard were involved in the launch of the Phoenix in both timelines, but it was also impossible for them to have gone back in time to the launch of the Phoenix simply because they do not exist (at least, they won't exist as we know them when the time comes, assuming they're even born at all (who's to say that LaForge's bachelor great-grandfather wasn't on the USS Mayflower when it went to Vulcan and was destroyed by the Narada, thus erasing any potential incarnation of LaForge from existing in the Abrams-verse's 24th century)).

So, really, the Abrams-verse is home to what is probably the most massive paradox in Star Trek history. </TEXT>
