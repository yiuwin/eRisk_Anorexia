	<DATE> 2017-01-26 05:28:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> D. Va is not vastly weaker than she was pre-nerf.

Her damage per shot went from 3 damage/pellet * 8 pellets = 24 to 2 damage/pellet * 11 pellets = 22, or from 16 to 11 vs armor. Overall, this reduces her to 146.7 DPS (from 160 DPS) against an unarmored target, which puts her primary weapon at the 10th or 11th highest DPS in the game (she was previously 8th or 9th, depending on how you count Zarya's DPS) - Torb's shotgun and Zenyatta with his orb of discord up are above her now.

The biggest difference you'll see in her damage output is against armored targets - she's lost about 1/3rd of her DPS against armor, so she does less damage to Bastion, D. Va, Reinhardt, and Winston, and Torb's armor packs are more effective against her than they were previously. Against other characters, the difference is less than 10% - and note that, because you get three extra pellets, you may not see much of a change at all (because you're more likely to hit with more pellets, though at point-blank range you will see a drop-off).

Her overall hit point total has changed from 400 armor and 200 health to 200 armor and 400 health. The largest impacts can be seen on Reaper, who can kill her in 6 body shots instead of 8 body shots, and on Sombra, who can kill her with 100 body shots instead of 125 (!) body shots (oh boy!). Roadhog can still kill her with a hook + four body shots, though he can miss with more pellets now. Torb can kill her with 5 shotgun blasts instead of a full clip of 6. The difference with Soldier 76 is only three bullets - 34 instead of 37 bodyshots.

The differences get smaller when you take headshots into account due to the decreased efficacy of armor vs higher damage.

D. Va is still very resilient and does quite a lot of damage. Indeed, she still has the highest effective hit point total of any character in the game while in her mech. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know we all want everyone else to know about the digital items we've managed to unlock this holiday season.

So, what did you guys manage to unlock?

I ended up using the [Winter Wonderland checklist](http://i.imgur.com/les76ZX.jpg), and by the end of it, I ended up unlocking all of the rare victory emotes naturally. I got two of the legendary skins (Nutcracker Zenyatta and Jingle Tracer), as well as four of the epic skins (Andes Lucio, Frostbite Pharah, Shiver Reaper, Peppermint Sombra).

At the end of the event, I ended up buying the Mystery Gift Zarya emote, as well as the Winter Wonderland spray and Sombra's voice line (I also managed to unlock Ana, Bastion, Mei, Reaper, and Torb naturally).

What did you all unlock?

What are your favorite (or, least favorite) unlocks this season?

Does anyone actually like the ornament sprays? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had 66 loot boxes - 50 from leveling, 15 from the arcade (3 boxes a week for 5 weeks - every week since the free weekend, inclusive), and 1 bonus box.

In total, just from boxes (i.e. discounting Origins edition stuff and achievement unlocks, as well as the free icon from the Winter Wonderland event), I've gotten:

151 unique commons, including 1 general spray
61 unique rares, including 28 player icons
14 unique epics
8 unique legendaries

For a total of 234 unique items, meaning I've had 30 duplicates or currency slot items over that time (I know one of those currency slot items was a legendary, too, so in theory I've opened 9 legendaries in that time span).

I know some folks are interested in random data like this, so I added it up this evening.

I have some characters with as few as six things unlocked for them, and some with as many as 13. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-30 22:25:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This happened many years ago, back when I was in high school.

One morning, I woke up, ate breakfast, went to the bus stop, got on the bus, went to school, and listened to the first lecture of the day.

At which point, during the first morning break, I woke up. I ate breakfast, I went to the bus stop, got on the bus, went to school, and listened to the first lecture of the day...

And it was the *exact same lecture* I had heard in my dream. I could even speak along with the lecture, saying what the teacher was going to say moments before they said it, and started doing so under my breath.

It was a very strange experience. I haven't experienced it again in the last decade and a half. </TEXT>

We had a real healer (a Lucio) on our team as well. It was pulling teeth to get someone to play healer, too. We ended up getting stomped pretty hard before we managed to stabilize right around the second checkpoint, and then managed to hold them there.

Good thing old Roadhog was there to keep snorting whatever he keeps in that mask of his. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-24 11:25:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Might be helpful to remind us all of games that these awards might apply to.

For myself:

**Test of Time:** *Batman: Arkham Asylum*. 2009 game, great game to this day. Tight story, tight plot, good villains, good voice acting. Honestly, I liked it better than any of its sequels in terms of its core experience. This was in competition with Civilization V for me.

**I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye**: *Papers, Please*. Those poor people. :(

**Just Five More Minutes**: *Mordheim: City of the Damned*. We all know Civ V or Civ VI is going to win this one, but I thought I'd nominate this because I had quite a bit of fun with it and constantly want to go back and play one more mission...

**Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!**: *The Stanley Parable*. A game about how choices in video games don't matter that plays with it by being extremely open-ended, but very, very short (and funny). *Bioshock* seems likely to take this category (especially if 2k Games asks "Would you kindly vote for our game?" on Twitter), but I really liked *The Stanley Parable* and loved the narrator's reactions to my actions.

**Villain Most In Need Of A Hug**: *Bastion*. Poor Zulf.

**Game Within A Game**: *Watch_Dogs*. I find the multiplayer experience within this single-player game to be really fun, but honestly, this was a pretty toss-up category for me, as it is only borderline a game within a game. I almost voted *Final Fantasy VIII* here, but I'm not a big enough monster to encourage anyone to play any more of that card game. *Shudder*

**I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award**: *Dust: An Elysian Tail*. Because I'm an incorrigible furry.

**Best Use Of A Farm Animal**: *DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon*, for the militant sheep. Sadly, we all know *Goat Simulator* is going to win this category.

And of course, for the "Everything We Forgot" category: **Best Title Screen Song**: Drunken Robot Pornography. Also in competition for *Strangest Name*, *Most Misleading Title*, and *Most Unnecessary Use Of "Pornography" In Its Title* awards.

So what did you guys nominate for which award? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-10-22 07:39:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I started out in this game fairly blindly. Right now I have the following team:

* Level 20 Modern Storm (3/4/1; could level her to 26 but don't have enough Iso-8 yet)

* Level 15 Ares (0/0/1, he was my very first random pull)

* Level 13 Hawkeye (could level him to 25, he's 5/2 right now)

* Level 11 Model 35 Iron Man (2/2/1)

* Level 4 Venom (2/2; could level him to level 10 but haven't bothered)

* Level 2 Juggernaut (1/1)

* Level 1 Spiderman (0/1/0)

Right now I have a single empty roster slot.

I have the following covers:

* Level 1 Modern Black Widow (Have 5! of her blue covers, and one of her purple covers)

* Level 15 Marvel Now! Thor x2 (Have 1 each of his red and green covers)

* Level 15 Astonishing X-men Wolverine (Have his green cover)

* Level 40(!) Model 40 Iron Man (Have his red cover; I got it as a random cover pull)

I'm not sure if the power of a level 40 character is worth the annoyance of them having only one power, if I'm better off trying to work on a level 2, or if I should acquire Black Window for her super stun.

My typical working team right now is mostly Storm/Hawkeye/Iron Man, which gives me a power for all six colors. Hawkeye's aiming ability has been pretty good to me, Storm is pretty good at triggering cascades, and Iron Man can dish out some serious damage (and the stun is a nice cherry on top when you go all game and then can pull it out at the end). Still, I'm not quite sure what I should be doing.

Any input would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An American, a German, and a Chinese man were all arguing over their drinks about whose country was the best.

The American started things off. "America invented the atomic bomb, discovered DNA, made the Internet, and went to the Moon. Without us, none of those things would have happened."

"Bah!" said the German. "Without us, you would be nothing! We Germans discovered nuclear fission that you needed for your bombs, discovered microbes were what made you sick, developed the theory of relativity, and pioneered the rockets and missiles that took you to the Moon."

"Pah," says the Chinese man. "When you were just barbarians herding goats, we in China invented paper, the printing press, gunpowder, and the compass, without which you would all be lost."

"Sure," replied the American, "But what have you done lately?" </TEXT>

It can breadboard with all components attached. Even just setting it in the case without screwing it in will cause it to short and not function (won't post, CPU fan won't turn on).

I've been reading some other folks posts about what they did, and some folks suggested putting an anti-static bag underneath the bottom of the motherboard and wrapping the stand-offs in electrical tape. Are these good ideas? </TEXT>

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

About two weeks ago, I finally got the whole thing assembled, everything to power on, ect. Got the whole thing to boot up, optical drive worked, case fans and case LEDs turned on, CPU fan and GPU fan turned on, ect.

I installed Windows 7, then upgraded to Windows 10 overnight.

When I woke up at about 10 am, the PSU fan was on, the green motherboard light was on, the case LEDs and front power indictator on the case were lit up, but nothing else was running - no case fans, no CPU fan, no GPU fan, though an additional green light on the circuitboard (the EZ XMP light according to the manual) does light up, none of the POST state LEDs do so.

I assumed that a reboot failed after observing the system for a short while, so I turned it off, then turned it back on. Same symptoms, and the system won't even post - the case LEDs light up, including the one on the front of the case, and the motherboard indicates it has power, and the PSU fan turned on, but NOTHING ELSE WORKS. Not the CPU fan. Not the GPU fan. Not the chassis fans, neither turning nor their LEDs.

There are no POST failure lights, but the system won't POST. Nothing ever appears on the screen.

After trying pretty much everything:

 I unplugged the whole thing from the wall with the PSU off for an hour, then turned it back on. Nothing.

 Connected the pins to clear the RTC RAM with a screwdriver and a paperclip. No effect

 Removed the CMOS battery from the motherboard for several minutes, attempted to clear the RTC RAM again before reinstalling it. No effect.

 Reseated the RAM. No effect.

 Swapped the RAM. No effect.

 Detached and re-attached CPU, Motherboard, and CPU fan connectors to motherboard. No effect.

 Removed GPU and booted without it. No effect.

 Detached SATA drives and booted without them. No effect.

I RMAed the motherboard to Newegg.

------

On Wednesday, I got my new motherboard, and I assembled my rig on Thursday. One of the RAM slots (DIMM A2) struggled to accept RAM, but both my RAM sticks would work in DIMM B2, and I could get the whole system to work with RAM in B1 and B2. I figured, "Fuck it, I don't want to have to deal with RMAing my motherboard yet again, it works," and so continued.

My SSD finished installing Windows 10, then I reset it using the windows 10 reset tool to get rid of any garbage. Loaded software onto my computer.

Next morning, huzzah, it still works! I spent all of yesterday loading software onto my computer, getting everything working, getting the 3TB HDD set up, ect. Everything seemed to be working great, and it was on all day yesterday (~16 hours) without incident. I put the side panel onto the case as it seemed to be working okay.

Today, I boot it up again and everything is fine. Install some stuff, do random internet stuff on it for about three hours. Go into the kitchen to make myself a grilled cheese sandwich, come back...

And the computer is dead.

**With exactly the same symptoms as it had the previous time.**

To reiterate:

The LED on the motherboard to indicate it has power is lit.

When I power it on, the chassis LEDs come on. The PSU fan turns on when I power up the computer. And **nothing else works**. Not the chassis fans (or their LEDs). Not the GPU. Not the CPU.

No POST lights come on; indeed, it doesn't seem to go through its normal bootup routine of checking RAM, GPU, CPU, ect. It turns on and just sits there like a lump.

I am incredibly frustrated at this point. The failures make no sense. What could possibly be causing these failures? Are the Asus Z170-A motherboards just a bunch of lemons? Are they especially prone to failure? Has anyone gotten one to work? Am I just really unlucky? Is something *else* strange going on, that would cause it to fail in this way in two consecutive builds after functioning for some time for some other reason?

Note that I didn't do any overclocking on it or anything, or fiddle with any of the BIOS settings.

**EDIT**

I pulled the motherboard out of the case and breadboarded it. Put it back in the case - no dice.

Thus, I have to conclude the cause is the case shorting it out somewhere.

How do you figure out where a short is happening? </TEXT>

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

Last night, I finally got my whole thing assembled, everything to power on, ect. Got the whole thing to boot up, optical drive worked, case fans and case LEDs turned on, CPU fan and GPU fan turned on, ect.

I installed Windows 7, then set it to upgrade to Windows 10 overnight while I slept. By about 6 am, when I went to sleep, it had finished downloading Windows 10 and was starting to install it.

This morning, at about 10 am, I woke up. The PSU fan was on, the green motherboard light was on, the case LEDs and front power indictator on the case were lit up, but nothing else was running - no case fans, no CPU fan, no GPU fan, though an additional green light on the circuitboard (the EZ XMP light according to the manual) does light up, none of the POST state LEDs do so.

I assumed that a reboot failed after observing the system for a short while, so I turned it off, then turned it back on. Same symptoms.

Worse, the system won't POST.

There are no POST state LED lights coming on on the motherboard, but the EZ XMP light does turn on when I power on the computer.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Turned the system off and back on again. Turned off everything, including the power supply, then turned the power supply back on and then turned the system back on.

I unplugged the whole thing from the wall with the PSU off for an hour, then turned it back on. Nothing.

Connected the pins to clear the RTC RAM with a screwdriver and a paperclip. No effect

Removed the CMOS battery from the motherboard for several minutes, attempted to clear the RTC RAM again before reinstalling it. No effect.

Reseated the RAM. No effect.

Swapped the RAM. No effect.

Detached and re-attached CPU, Motherboard, and CPU fan connectors to motherboard. No effect.

Removed GPU and booted without it. No effect.

Detached SATA drives and booted without them. No effect. </TEXT>

PC Part Picker reports no compatibility problems, and looking at the page, it is supposedly compatible with Intel Socket 1155 / 1156 / 1151 / 1150 / 775.

Well, I got my parts today (I already had the fan) and after attaching the CPU to the motherboard went to put on the fan mount. And then I discovered that the fan mount does not seem to match up to the motherboard - specifically, the holes appear to be somewhere in the range of 1/4th - 1/8th of an inch off - I can get two of the bolts in, but not the other two.

[The online manual](http://www.zalman.com/global/product/Product_Read.php?Idx=277) I found on Zalman's site suggests a somewhat different set of included parts (including washers and nuts) and is a different set of instructions.

Looking at the box of the fan I have, it says that it is compatible with all Intel Socket 775/478 CPUs and all AMD Socket AM2 / 754 / 939 / 940 CPUs.

This suggests to me that at some point Zalman updated the CNPS9500A LED kit with some new parts, and I have an older fan.

However, I'm somewhat confused how, if the bolt holes have moved, something could be compatible with both a 775 and the newer sockets, which makes me wonder if I'm just doing something wrong, and my fan mount would in fact fit on the motherboard I have.

I'm loath to buy a new fan if the one I have would work, but I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong.

Alternatively, if I could pick up another fan mount for much less and just use the rest of the kit, that would also save money (not that it is a huge deal,though).

Does anyone have any clue if the 775 and the newer Intel sockets have different bolt holes for the mounts?

The clip support that I have looks the same as the one listed as the Intel clip support in the online manual, but it is possible it has subtly different dimensions.

Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

The purpose of this computer is to replace my now 6-year old PC. The PSU on my old computer burned out (I could smell it :( ) and it is about time to get a new one anyway.

Typical things I do include Excel spreadsheets, Photoshop, and gaming. I stream video occasionally as well. I have a dual monitor setup - a 1200p and a 1080p monitor.

**Things I don't understand**

It has been six years since I last built a PC (winter of 2009 was when I built my last one) and I have paid zero attention to pretty much anything since then.

I went with the i7 CPU because from my reading, the hyperthreading is apparently useful for doing things like manipulating large spreadsheets and Photoshop. That seemed to be the main advantage over the i5, in addition to somewhat better base clockspeed.

The fan was simply what seemed to be recommended by the site; my last computer wasn't overclocked, but I don't mind overclocking. Is that a decent fan for the purpose?

I have little understanding of the differences between the various Z170 motherboards. I chose the one that was cheapest, but I don't really know if that's right. Should I choose a different one?

I figured 32 GB of RAM was probably adequate for what I was doing with it. Any issues anyone can see there? Is that a decent brand to use? Does it even matter?

I have no clue on the case either; it was cheap and the site said it was compatible, and it seemed to have a decent amount of space for stuff.

I already own a CD/DVD drive and a 3 TB HDD that I've never actually used; I'm going to use the latter as a data drive.

The SSD I chose seemed like it was at an excellent price point for what it was; 1 TB of SSD for $200 is way less than the competition. However, reading various websites and reviews of it, allegedly its cache isn't amazing. Is that a decent choice, or is it better to go for a smaller SSD (250 or 500 GB?) with better performance?

Any help/advice would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is more of a shower calculation, but it was really bothering me when I was thinking about water conservation.

How much water does it take to make one pound of beef, including the water required to grow the food to feed the cow?

If you ask this question of Google, youll find a variety of responses:

[Vegsource](http://www.vegsource.com/articles/factoids.htm) cites a number of numbers, ranging from 2,464 gallons per pound of beef (according to the Water Education Foundation) to 12,009 gallons per pound of beef (according to David Pitmentel, a professor of ecology and agricultural science at Cornell University. [PETA](http://www.peta.org/videos/meat-wastes-water/) closely echoes this claim, at 2,400 gallons per pound, while [Treehugger](http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/from-lettuce-to-beef-whats-the-water-footprint-of-your-food.html) claims 2,500  5,000 gallons per pound.

[The USGS](http://water.usgs.gov/edu/activity-watercontent.php) suggests that a 1/4th pound hamburger takes 460 gallons of water, meaning a pound would be 1840, though it notes that figure with the caveat that a lot of assumptions are built into it and the figure is heavily dependent on how you raise the cow. Other sources, such as [the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/13/food-water-footprint_n_5952862.html) and [GRACE](http://www.gracelinks.org/1361/the-water-footprint-of-food), repeat this figure. [Waterfootprint.org](http://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Hoekstra-2008-WaterfootprintFood.pdf) claims beef requires 15,500 liters per kg of beef, which works out to 1,857 gallons per pound, so is probably the same figure and it is just rounding.

[ExploreBeef](http://www.explorebeef.org/cmdocs/explorebeef/fact_sheet_beef%20and%20water%20use.pdf) cites a UC Davis study which put it at 441 gallons of water per pound of beef. [James W. Oltjen](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/water-needs-meat-production), who did the study, notes that the amount of irrigated grain makes a huge impact on water use estimates; a cow who eats nothing but non-irrigated food produces beef at the cost of 105 gallons of water per pound of beef, while a cow who eats nothing but irrigated grain rises up to 675 gallons of water per pound of beef. The 441 gallons of water per pound of beef is also echoed by [meat mythcrushers](http://www.meatmythcrushers.com/myths/myth-it-takes-2400-gallons-of-water-to-make-a-pound-of-beef.html) and [your doctors orders](http://www.yourdoctorsorders.com/2014/12/how-much-water-to-make-a-pound-of-beef/).

So, who is right?

The US produced [23.69 billion pounds of beef in 2015](http://www.beefusa.org/beefindustrystatistics.aspx) according to BeefUSA; other sources seem to agree with this figure, suggesting it is probably right, or at least very close to correct.

[According to the USGS](http://water.usgs.gov/watuse/wuto.html), the US used 355 billion gallons per day of water in 2010. This works out to 129,575,000,000,000 gallons per year (thats 129,575 billion gallons of water per year).

Thats a lot of water!

Obviously, not all of that water is used for agriculture. Indeed, most of it isnt:

http://water.usgs.gov/watuse/images/category-pages/2010/total-category-pie-2010.png

Overall agricultural use of water in the US constitutes only 115 billion gallons per day for irrigating crops and only 2 billion gallons per day for livestock. Combined, this works out to 42,750 billion gallons of water per year.

Once you compare this to the beef figure, something becomes immediately obvious: almost all of these numbers have to be wrong.

At 12,009 gallons per pound of beef, that would mean that annual US beef production takes 284,493 billion gallons of water per year. This is not only in excess of the amount of water used in the US for agriculture, it is in excess of the amount of water used in the US for everything *combined*. In fact, it is more than double the total annual use of water by Americans. I sincerely hope that Dr. Pitmentel was misquoted, and this was supposed to be liters per kg, as this is obviously ridiculous on the face of it, and any sort of sanity check would have instantly revealed it.

But as it turns out, the other figures arent much better.

At 5,000 gallons per pound of beef, that would mean total annual water use for beef production was 118,450 billion gallons of water  or over 90% of total US annual water use for *all* uses.

At 2,500 gallons per pound of beef, that would put total annual water use for beef production at 59,225 billion gallons of water per year  which is still more than the total use of water by American agriculture for *all* irrigation and livestock combined.

At 1,800 gallons per pound of beef, were looking at a total of 42,642 billion gallons of water per year  which is almost exactly identical to the total water use for *all* American agriculture combined (within rounding distance). This could be coincidence  or it could be the result of someone simply taking total US agricultural water use, thinking that was the total used for *beef production*, and dividing it by the amount of beef produced per year, and then a bunch of other people repeating the number without really thinking about it.

At 441 gallons per pound of beef, were put at 10,447 billion gallons of water per year used for beef production  roughly 1/4th of total American water use for agricultural purposes. Given the amount of beef produced and consumed in the US, this is, at last, a plausible number  we do grow a lot of other stuff, but we probably do devote a lot of resources to beef production.

Two takeaways:

1)	When you calculate a number, or see a number which seems really extraordinary, do a sanity check against a target number to see if your calculated number makes sense.

2)	Dont trust anyone when they tell you how much water it takes to produce any crop, ever. If theyre off by a factor of 4 (or more!) on beef, theyre probably wrong on everything *else*, too. </TEXT>
