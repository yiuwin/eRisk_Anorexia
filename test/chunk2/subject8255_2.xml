	<TEXT> It came with the integra I bought to pull the motor from. I would prefer the stock gsr manifold to be honest. I'm waiting to buy any engine management since ill be boosting next year and picking up an s300 setup. It pulls well but I'm ultra sensitive to it being a little lean up top since I tune engines for a living </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never posted in here before but wanted to share my project and where it currently is at. Bought it stock 2 years ago and in the past 2 months after it being my daily, I finally swapped in a B18C. Been documenting it on Youtube. 
The end all goal for this project is to transform it into a time attack car for next summer. Currently trying to pick out the suspension and wheel/tire combo best suited. 
Let me know what you think! </TEXT>
