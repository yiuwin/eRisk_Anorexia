	<TEXT> Haha, he stopped doing it, at least using his own pictures. His parents made him delete all of his social media two years ago. An angry girlfriend (one of the many he has cheated on) posted nudes of him and sent them to his parents. Being the strict Muslims that they are, they did not take it too well. 

He had an epic life. He attended a university in Miami (his parents donated a crazy huge amount, he got 1300/2400 on his SAT!) and had his own house, 3 cars, and a fucking housekeeper! Now, he lives at home and attends Community College so his parents can keep an eye on him. 

He probably is up to catfishing again, all I know is, he is one crazy fucker. </TEXT>
