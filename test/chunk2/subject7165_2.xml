	<TEXT> I agree with redkinoko

Our country needs us more than ever Loving your country is different from being proud of it, and obviously we don't have a lot of things to be proud of. I used to envy the west due to their advancements in technology and philosophy. I admire their liberal values and rich democratic philosophical texts. Meanwhile our country still suffers deeply from political patronage and political dynasties and the public has become passive and more accepting of their misery due to Catholic brainwashing. I use to look at my skin and regret not being born white. I envied the koreans and japense for still being able to retain their prestige when they go to Europe while we Filipinos are looked down upon and stereotyped as househelpers. Filipeneza is the greek word for domestic helper. I later realized the problem is not my skin color or my motherland, its my fellow Filipinos who made a fool of us all. People like duterte and tito sotto occupy positions of power that should be reserved for our best and brightest. Our political and cultural elites are joke and it is unnerving that people aspire to be like them. There is a need to improve the quality of education because at the moment, our educational system only aims to produce bodies that are capable of becoming laborers and profit makers. This is why the culture of anti-intellectualism and sexism still persists. That is why I aspire to become worthy to assume position of power someday and uproot those asshats from the government. Among the many things I'll do is encourage democratic norms, secularize the country, and implement educational reforms </TEXT>
