	<TEXT> If you have documentation of his military career, use that to help spur conversation and jog his memory.  For example, maybe you say something like "You started in the Army at Camp Wolters in the summer of 1941 - how did you feel when you first arrived at the camp?"  and "You first started working in bombers in the spring of 1942 - what did you think the first time you went up in one?"  Ask about friends he made while serving or maybe other people from his hometown who went into service at the same time he did. These types of "safer" questions about training and pre-combat days might be good for getting started in the conversation.  Let him get comfortable and open up on his own terms.  

My own grandfather died in the war, so I never had the chance to ask him questions, but I have pieced together many things from letters people kept and his military records handed down in the family (like many other people, his official military records were largely destroyed in a fire decades ago).   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looking at your great-grandpa's obit, it sounds like he shipped out from Ft Ord on Feb 1945 on the way to the Philippines.  My grandfather died in combat with the 503rd PIR on Corrigedor in the Philippines in Feb 1945.  IIRC, my grandfather left Ord in Oct 1944.  I have my grandfather's personal effects that the army shipped back.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just verified these dimensions on one of my handles and they look accurate.  Came to 11 1/2 for the last one, so very good from photo scaling.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's (at least one) app for that - the Insurance Information Institute has a free app for cataloging your stuff one room at a time with photos so you have a record.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been a while since I've made much, but I decided to make something with the wood still screwed into a faceplate from this other recent project - http://imgur.com/a/ZK2Yu  

I tend towards simple forms with smooth finishes.  It's sanded down, then sanding sealer, sanding, three coats of Waterlox finish with light sanding between and then finished with three buffing wheels (red, white and wax).  It's my typical finishing process, but the number of coats of Waterlox varies by piece.   </TEXT>
