	<TEXT> Roommate and I (both recent grads) are here for the rest of summer - have a poker set but unfortunately no location to play at as of yet (we can play at mlk student union if need be). Down for blinds ranging from .10/.20 to .25/.50! Also let me know of any groups you all already have going on or comment/PM me if interested in starting a new one </TEXT>
