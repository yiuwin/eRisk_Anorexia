	<TITLE> Recommendation for classical guitar lessons in Boston? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-02 21:11:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I live in Southie but don't mind traveling to anywhere in Greater Boston (within reason). If they come to my place for lessons, that would be cool as well.

Ideally I'd like to work with a small business or local musician/student making some extra cash teaching lessons. I don't want to attend any sort of school or class.

I want to work with someone who makes learning guitar fun. I love music but have no musical ability whatever. I'm a true beginner.

Quick back story for those who care: My mother's first husband was a music teacher and died very young because of diabetes complications (my mom was just 21 at the time). Anyway, she kept his guitar - its a 1970's Yamaha classical guitar - and she gave it to me about 10 years ago.

It has been sitting in my various rooms over that period of time never being played. Just recently I set a goal to get it cleaned up (re-strung etc.) and to learn to play it.

My goal is to surprise my mom in the near future by playing it for her unexpectedly. For that reason, I am not telling her about getting it fixed or starting lessons.

I figured there has to be a lot of musicians on reddit (see: creative people) so I wanted to ask here instead of relying on sites like Yelp. </TEXT>

ps - Not being judgmental but the reason the dogs pees if she is out is because she is old and really has to go. Dogs won't pee in their crates usually but it's painful for them to hold it for that long. Again, not judging - just letting you know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's complete B.S. Adhering to stricter security policies so that people can travel the globe safely isn't a blank check for tyranny.

However, I am glad there are people like OP who point out the flawed TSA and I'm glad there are people like me who fight for such security measures.

Because true tyranny flourishes when one side of any line grows too strong. Our difference in opinion is what ultimately keeps the other side in check. 

Just don't go telling me that we have lost our freedom because we have to take off our shoes before boarding a plane. Freedom isn't always free, it comes with sacrifices - some small and some large. I consider these minor inconveniences unfortunate but necessary. If you can't see that then maybe you need to loosen your tinfoil hat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was the first person in my high school to realize what was happening. I had "video" class 1st period, a class that was in a TV Studio that was built in the library (the town I grew up in was affluent) and a class that barely ever had a teacher. The "teacher" was a guy who wore many hats and most of the time was busy showing teachers how to use technology and fixing broken tvs/projectors/computers. Anyway, I didn't feel like filming or editing any new footage so I went in the back area and turned on the TV. The TV was already turned to the news and they were talking about a fire at the Pentagon - not the WTC - at first.

Minutes later they began focusing on the fire at WTC 1. Minutes after that I watched the second plane hit the 2nd tower live. After that, the other 2 kids in my "class' and the rest of the library was in the studio area watching.

That day, after class my friends and I decided to go to the local rotary in town (a rotary is a roundabout for those of you not from MA) with American flags. I taped my flag to a hockey stick and began waiving it at the passing traffic like mad. There were at least 20 other friends doing the same thing. Cars were honking, cheering and some even went around the rotary multiple times to show their support. It was a surreal moment in my life that out of context would be extremely strange but with the raw emotion of that day, somehow made perfect sense.

The next day I attached another American flag to another hockey stick and flew the 2 flags on the back of my pickup truck. The local newspaper spotted me driving through town like this and put the picture on the front page a few days later. My parents have it framed at their house still.

edit: spelling   added some detail to hit the 750 character threshold. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I saw a similar comment on a [local Boston site](http://theawesomeboston.com/must-see-illustration-of-all-32-nfl-team-mascots-at-war/) I follow:

*In a classic King Kong-esque plot line, you would have the giant vs. modern flying technology. I would normally say that the jet would drop a few bombs on the giant and that would be the end  but this is the New York Jets we are talking about. The jets pilot would probably fumble with the gear, fly too close to the giant beast and be picked off.* </TEXT>
