	<TEXT> AK12 RIP with Grip + Extended mags = wow.

I love the weapon, but I find I need to use it when I'm placing myself strategically around the map. 

I love play Gung-Ho, and that's when I use the ASM1. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Camp against a wall, and just aim. lol

Or, you could just strategically place yourself around the map so you're only running along alleys or through certain parts. Instead of being central of the map, where you're open to the enemies sight, try to manouvre yourself around the edges of the map, always being ready to fire as you turn a corner.

Have QuickDraw and Grip as two attachments as a standard :) that's what I do, and I'm not too shabby. </TEXT>
