	<TEXT> It seems they are talking about communicating with radio telescopes but they are also talking about how long we would have to survive to come in contact.
If we can survive for more than 2 kyr, we have a chance.
If we have a chance, then our current technology must look infantile
to the typical civilization. (Our age is 1/40th of the typical age.)
So its a safe bet that we are either alone or in the presence of
civilizations far more advanced than ourselves.
This affects the search strategy somewhat
1. We must stay alive longer than 2 kyr.
2. We have fewer than 1010/2000 = 5 million stars to search. At some
point well have to start searching at least 2500 per year.
3. We can hope that these advanced aliens are broadcasting for us </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came across this document from the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics University of Toronto http://www1.astro.utoronto.ca/~rayjay/ast251/lecture11.pdf

On page 9 and 10 it says: For astronomers, the interference is communications.
For interstellar messages, the interference is astronomy.
Where shall we meet our neighbours?
At the water hole, where species have always gathered. 
Is the water hole a frequency or is it a place and where would it be?

There is pictures dipicting our progress as humankind and things about what we know how to do and there is pictures that say caution showing a picture of fighting  as a warning to the ET's.
I also find it very interesting they are doing lectures and learning about Interstellar Travel and Galactic Colonization as it states the next lecture will be at the last page of the document. Why are humans learning about Interstellar Travel and Galactic Colonization, it is quite mind blowing. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was wondering what movies are worth watching in 2016 cause I know theres a lot of horrible movies out there and I dont want to waste my time. A couple that I would recommend that i've enjoyed so far this year is The Conjuring 2, The Witch, The shallows, Midnight Special, The Neon Demon, Before I wake, 10 Cloverfield Lane, Suicide Squad, X-Men Apocalypse and Lights out. I'd appreciate any suggestions of movies from this year, preferably Sci-fi, Horror, Thriller, or Action. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In 2012 I couldnt stop looking at the stars everynight and I felt a warm presence coming from the universe, It was a loving energy that made me want to pursue whatever it was. I also would start looking at the time and it would be 4:20 almost everytime I looked at a clock and it would show up in other things aswell. I took this as a sign of some sort and have been meditating and trying to connect with the universe and expand my conciousness. Whatever or whoever that feeling was that I felt when I would look into the stars in 2012 made me a spiritual person since then. I would like to know how to fully pursue this feeling I am getting from the universe or the beings that are sending me their vibrational waves.  </TEXT>
