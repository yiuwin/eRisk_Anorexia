	<TEXT> Yeah, this was the first episode of the season where my heart was pounded due to the tension.

(The most intense episode for me though was when Raylan and Winona had to fight off the Detroit thugs. The season 4 finale I believe.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I remember, Boyd did insinuate to the Marshalls (Tim and Rachel) that Raylan had a part in Nicky's death.

But Rachel just waived him off by saying, "Oh, that investigation is over".

I think this happened in the 11th or 12th episode of the 5th season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   "These and other poignant remains testify to the final moments 4000 years ago of Lajia, a farming village at an altitude of about 1800 meters on the eastern edge of Tibet. Archaeologist Cai Linhai of the Qinghai Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology in Xining, who is excavating there, calls it the Pompeii of the Tibetan Plateau. The daily lives of early Tibetan farmers were preserved by the mud that swallowed their village 4000 years ago, but their origins are a mystery. Lajia, on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, met its end when a mudflow engulfed it, perhaps triggered by an earthquake in the seismically active region. "

I don't fully recall, but didn't they leave (or were fired, or went AWOL) the FBI at the end of the TV series?

Even during the 2nd film...weren't they still on the run?

They *could* get reinstated I guess, but it would seem more realistic for them to be something like consultants.

	<TEXT> This was a pretty funny episode.

I loved Dark Flynn: "Minions, imposters be gone. Daddy's hoooooome."

And Lamia was funny when she got deweaponed: "What is with today?!!"

All in all, it was great to see Noah Wyle again. The show is fun and good without him, but absolutely great when he's on.

At the end, what was the implication? Were Jenkins and DuLock lovers? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, from the preview, I thought this episode was going to be terrible, but that ending was great.

It really tied things together, and added some unexpected sentiment.

Although I wouldn't say the show is great, it is good and I hope it gets better.

Instead of more fantasy focused episodes like today's (and next week's episode seemingly about dragons) I hope the show can focus on more world mythologies a la Supernatural, Grimm, and The X-Files. </TEXT>

I *partially* agree with you; he took a risk in a warzone, and this brutal outcome wasn't...completely unexpected. 

I do feel sympathy for him, and his family. He seemed like a nice enough guy.

As Stalin said, 'One man's death is a tragedy, a million deaths are just a statistic" (something along those lines).

Foley wasn't a bad guy, or hurting anyone, he was just doing his job. 

He was brutally murdered by the terrorists of ISIS. And that is a tragedy.

	<TEXT> Cheers!

It has been a fun ride watching the show over the years.

Through good episodes and bad, I've always enjoyed the bitching and banter on this sub.

It's been real, r/trueblood! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How do they expect to crank out 7 seasons of content without getting sidetracked from the main bomb story? 3 seasons would probably be better, that way the show doesn't get stale.

You're right, 3 seasons of excellent drama would be great.

They're off to a decent start; let's hope they keep it up (and build on it).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  well, minimal dialogue from Brona. Brona's naked backside made a length appearance

I don't think anyone will complain about that!

 I can't figure out Vanessa/Sir Malcolm's relationship.

I'm sure at some point in the past, Malcom saved her/took her in. But he is singlemindedly trying to get his daughter back. Remember what he said before, "I would murder the entire world to get her back" (something to the effect)? That's why he doesn't mind using Vanessa (or anyone) as bait. Nothing really matters to him except getting her back.

 I would have rather found out more about the new and unfamiliar -- Vanessa Ives in particular, both because she's such a mystery and because Eva Green is amazing.

Her eyes (in the scene when she's explaining things to Ethan) were mesmerizing. 

 I enjoyed the episode, but wished that so much of it hadn't been taken up by the Frankenstein/Caliban storyline. 

Well, at least they got it out of the way. I don't think they'll be spending anymore time on his backstory. </TEXT>
