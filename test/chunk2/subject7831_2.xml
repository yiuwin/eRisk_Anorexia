	<TITLE> Losing Motivation.. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I don't really even know how to explain the head space I'm in. It's 2:30 am of day 25 clean. I'm so damn close to 30 days. In the beginning I was super motivated to change and finally get clean. It took me a few months since making the decision to get clean to get this much consecutive clean time. The first little while I went to as many NA meetings I could get to. I called people whenever I was struggling. I cut ties with all my friends who use. Which is basically all of them. I had all the motivation in the world to be clean and I worked really, really hard to get there.

 But lately.. things have been weird. I haven't really had too many strong cravings or whatever. But I just don't feel the motivation to keep working at being clean. Like.. I want to go to parties. I want to hang out with my friends. I want to DO something. I feel like all I do is just sit around now because I lost all my friendships. I'm so fucking bored. I just kind of feel like, fuck it. Why not just go back to how it was? I don't know what to do. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

TL;DR: 25 days clean, Don't really have cravings anymore, but lost motivation to stay clean. Advice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I completely agree. As someone who has dealt with both an eating disorder (granted I wasn't over weight so it wasn't a food addiction per se) and drug addiction, drugs have proven much harder to kick. It's why it irritates me so much that people on here bitch about how you shouldn't celebrate anyone kicking drugs because it was a bad choice to start using. But as soon as someone comes around saying "I lost 100 lbs!" everyone is so excited and supportive. Why aren't they bitching about how it was a bad choice to become overweight in the first place?

	<TEXT> Yeah. I know a lot of the time if people seek therapy options after, they are told (eventually) to use the term survivor. Life really sucks if you go around thinking of yourself as a victim forever. In a way, it's something that seems very simple, but that can have a huge impact on helping someone overcome the rape and move on with their lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who has been through that situation, people normally refer to people as "survivors of rape" more because they didn't have a complete psychological break down and shit. And a lot of the time people refer to themselves as survivors because it helps to get out of the victim mentality and it stops victim blaming a little bit. It's difficult to explain. But I see what you're saying. I don't know. It's an iffy topic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a similar thing recently. I had 6 days then used. You'll most likely experience some of the symptoms again but they shouldn't be as severe. I still got sick and stuff but it wasn't nearly as bad as it was the first time around. 

Keep your head up. After I relapsed and had to start the wds again, someone told me Just remember that this is the last time you ever have to feel ilke this. It's so true. You have that control and power. Stay strong. Pm me if you ever need to talk to someone. Good luck!!

	<TEXT> Don't ever feel like your struggle is insignificant or anything like that. No one here is here to judge. We all get it. I felt so pathetic and stupid. But the thing is, you're allowed to feel however you feel. Don't feel bad about having a hard time. I sat and sobbed my eyes out with a friend one night because I just felt so awful. It's okay to struggle. If you try to ignore that or pretend you aren't having a hard time at all, that's when you're going to relapse or something. Just accept that you feel like shit, know that you have the power to NEVER feel like this again by not using, and hold on to the fact that it will be over soon. 

Do some research. That helped me too. Days 2-5 are typically the worst. They subside after the first week. Some times the headache will last for a while longer. But you're almost out of the woods. :)

Feel free to pm me any time you need to vent or whatever. I don't have all the answers because I'm still on this journey myself. But I understand and I'm always willing to help where I can. Hang in there man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I don't have any advice on that. I didn't really medicate with anything. I'd take an ibuprofen every now and them for headaches. If you smoke, cigarettes have helped me. (not that I want to encourage smoking.. I'm working on quitting that next. But one thing at a time you know). And caffeine. Other than that, just kind of riding it out is what I've been doing. Trying to relax and be distracted at the same time.. Like I would go watch movies with a friend who knew what was going on or things like that. 

I wish I had better advice. This part of it is miserable. We all get it. Anyone who has gotten clean understands how you're feeling. It's awful. But it goes away. You do eventually stop feeling like shit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today is my day 6. I feel so, so much better physically. I would't say physical wds are gone completely, but they are definitely much less severe. From my experience, you're pretty close to getting to feel a lot better. Day 4 was the day I finally got my sorry ass out of the house and tried to keep living my life. I honestly think that helped a little bit. 

Hang in there. You're almost there. Just don't cave in. I made that mistake. It's taken me 2 months since deciding to get clean to make it to 6 consecutive days of clean time. You relapse and have to start the physical shit again. So just stay strong. It'll be better soon. :)

	<TITLE> Day 3: Stresses and Worries. thoughts? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm on day 3 of being clean after a couple of slip ups since deciding to get clean. I feel like death. My emotions are all over the place. Typical withdrawals. I went to my first NA meeting today. I have so many mixed feelings about it. Uncomfortable. Awkward. Scary as hell. But in the end, I came out of it with a whole list of numbers of people to lean on for help and support.

The issue I've been dealing with today is almost silly in a way. It's something that I'm stressing out about a lot. I'm having my wisdom teeth removed in a few weeks. It isn't for another 3 weeks. But I'm terrified. I don't know what I'm going to do. I know I'll be given a prescription of, most likely, hydros. Those are what I first got hooked on. I know I'll need them to begin with. But majority of patients don't need the whole prescription. I'm scared of how I'll react to it. 

Has anyone else been in this sort of situation? Any advice for getting through it without relapse? I know it's a ways off. But it's all I can think about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have any great answer.. I'm only on day 3 clean myself right now.. But despite how awful it feels sometimes, I really, really do believe that clean life is so much better. 

Since I start decided to get clean I have lost every single person I ever called a friend because all of my relationships were with people who use. So I get what it's like when it seems like there is literally nothing but drugs. The best advice I have and the only thing that's kept my fighting the past couple of weeks, through relapses and all that shit, is to REACH OUT. People on this subreddit are amazing. I have had so many people reach out and message me after I posted here about needing help and support. I don't know how much I have to offer, but if you ever need someone to talk to who understands and is fighting the same fight as you are, please feel free to pm me any time. To vent or whatever. I also went to my first NA meeting today. It's so uncomfortable and honestly I'm not sure I'll keep going. But even if I don't, I now have a whole list of numbers of people who are choosing to live their lives clean that want to help. 

I know I'm not where you are or whatever. But just don't give up. If you really make an effort to look, you're bound to find people who aren't using. they are out there. Maybe look and see if your area has a subreddit. I know lots of places do. Then you can post something there about looking for clean people to associate with.

I don't know if any of this is any help. If nothing else, just know that there are people who want you to succeed and want to support you. You can make it. Clean life is better. I sure as hell know that it doesn't seem like it. But it is. FInd people and lean on their hope and knowledge.

Good luck. You'll make it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beginning of day 4 after my second relapse since I decided to get clean... Went to my first NA meeting today. I have very, very mixed feelings about the experience I had. A lot of really good things, and a really not good thing.. I think I'll keep trying though. At least for a little while. I'm really struggling to not pick up and use again.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually on a wait list to start seeing someone for something not completely related to drug use. But still very related because I feel like everything is at this point.. So I don't know. Maybe that will help. I'm kind of in limbo with it right now. It's a free service offered by an organization in my area so it's booked up pretty fast. I can't afford anything else. Poor college student, who also does drugs. Money is a little tight. ha. But I'm hoping that will help figure some other things out and, in turn, help me while I'm trying to get clean.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. I know it could be worse. I've only been taking pills for like two years. But I just feel like it's out of control and like I'm ruining my life with this shit. I put quite a bit of money into school and I have yet to go to a single class not high.. I feel really pathetic. I mean, I know to some people pills for two years is nothing and I should be able to handle it. But I'm really struggling. It doesn't even feel like it's take over my life; it feels like it is my life. The past week that I was clean, I could hardly get myself out of my house. I feel so stupid and pathetic asking for help from people because I know there are others worse off than me. And yet, I can't seem to manage anything. I haven't seen my family in months, not since I moved out to be honest. For the most part, they don't know that I have this problem. I lost contact with most of the people I was friends with in high school because of it. Except for the ones who use. I don't really have any friends who don't use. I feel like even if I were to reach out to people I was friends with before it got really bad they wouldn't want me back in their lives or they wouldn't believe that I'm trying to make changes.

Again, I know it sounds stupid. But when life hit me with some shit that no one should ever have to deal with, instead of sucking it up and figuring it out in a healthy way like most people do, I turned to drugs. And I have ever since then. I don't even know how to begin dealing with reality anymore. 

I'm really trying. I have things I want to do with my life. I want to be successful. I want to finish school. I just feel kind of lost and I worry that I've already messed it up too much. </TEXT>
