	<TEXT> It's probably the adrenaline. Thea just found out that she shot the arrow that killed Sara and then she immediately gets jumped by the man who killed her mom in front of her. Oliver's worst fear is harm coming to Thea. I mean he fought Ra's to protect her. I imagine seeing Slade hold a gun to Thea's head would kick him into action. </TEXT>
