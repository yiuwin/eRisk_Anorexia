	<TEXT> It doesn't really matter to me that some sets aren't optimal for an endgame build. For starting out a season and getting some initial farming done, I'm partial to the flexible sets that support a wide variety of builds and that can be adjusted. IK, Natalya's and Arachyr are all versatile support options that don't lock you into a specific build, so before I have all the gear I need, those are my favorites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heh... relevant username. I mean, playing a certain character is no guarantee that a set dungeon would be easy. I tend to main as a DH and that didn't make Unhallowed's dungeon any less laptop-throwingly frustrating. I agree that it's a matter of personal experience; I bet I'd look less favorably toward the Wastes dungeon if I hadn't gotten it relatively quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've got less than 72 hours to get a basically brand-new character to the point where you can clear a GR60 by yourself and get a number of legendary gems up to at least level 40 (for augmenting), not counting the gems you're already wearing. You also have to finish two conquests, master a set dungeon, and kill several high-level bosses within severely brief time limits. Maybe if you have a few friends who can speed you through T13 rifts round the clock for three days with no sleep, but even then it's a ludicrously tall order. I'd say stick to playing casually and just enjoy yourself so you're not burned out when S8 starts :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yeah, it's a real game changer. It was introduced in Season 4 and the maximum GR clears just skyrocketed. The particular gear you should equip depends entirely on your build, but there are a few items that are good in general. The Furnace, In-Geom, Convention of Elements, any immunity amulets, Nemesis Bracers, Leoric's Crown; all decent options if there isn't a better more specific option. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can only equip three affixes: one weapon, one armor, and one jewelry. The Cube tab that opens when you click on it will display three slots, and clicking on it will show you a list of every item you have already extracted. You can select one from there to equip it, and you can switch them out whenever you're in town.

The level of the item does not matter at all, and if the item's affix has a variable (like The Furnace giving 25-50% bonus damage to elites), the extraction automatically gets the maximum value regardless of what was on the original item. A level 18 Leoric's Crown is no worse than a level 70 in the Cube; the property will always be 100%. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If we're talking pre-nerfs, Firebird's was insane. You had to actually kill monsters with the meteor instead of just hitting them. That meant grouping enemies and damaging them to within an inch of death with a non-fire Black Hole. This is all while doing just enough but not too much damage to apply the burning phase dot. Point is, it was a very specific set-up and still RNG dependent. What a pain. </TEXT>

Everybody seems to give Wrath of the Wastes crap for being hard, but it wasn't that bad for me once I got the strat down. It wasn't even the hardest Barb dungeon (that goes to Earth, which was medium-hard). As long as you keep Gangway up the enemies will never touch you, and Wrenching Smash keeps them stunned long enough to get a clean Rend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kanai's Cube is an item you can only obtain in Adventure Mode, that allows you to "extract" the unique affix of a legendary item, then attach as many as three of these affixes to your character as passives. Once you acquire the Cube itself (from the Ruins of Sescheron in Act 3), it will appear in town like any other craftsman. Other things you can do besides extracting are: upgrading a rare item into a random legendary or set item of the same type (sword, pants, ring, etc.), "reforging" (getting back the same legendary or set item with completely re-rolled stats), converting set items (getting a random new item from the same set, in case you're missing, for example, Roland's gloves but have two sets of boots). There are a few other recipes, all of which are explained in a tab of the Cube menu. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, turns out Eirena's mentor is a completely different former angel masquerading as a human calling himself The Prophet. How's that for confusing? Anyway, Inarius first altered the Worldstone to weaken the Nephalem, but Lilith (ever wanting that army and also perhaps wanting to protect her children) secretly altered it again to allow future Nephalem to be born extremely rarely. The first ever Nephalem to be born that way was Uldyssian, protagonist of the Sin War books. The second is the hero from Diablo 3. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Testament of Inarius gets about as far as the creation of Sanctuary, but it only tells his side of the story. Fact was, Inarius was an incredible narcissist. He originally wanted to destroy that first generation of his union with Lilith (the likes of whom included Bul-Kathos and Rathma and all those legendary names) but opted to basically nerf them instead, altering the Worldstone so that each subsequent generation would get weaker and weaker, eventually losing their immortality and becoming the regular mortals. Then he made himself a human avatar, The Prophet, and started a religion casting himself as a messiah and miracle-worker. So he basically only spared the Nephalem from certain doom only because he wanted someone to worship him as God.

I love talking about this stuff :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the first time I'm putting this thought into words so I'm sorry if I don't phrase it quite right, but I didn't like how Diablo 3 ended after reading the Sin War trilogy. An important point that the books were trying to make was that *neither* side was looking out for the best interests of the Nephalem and of humanity. Inarius' sanctimonious ego was just as poisonous to them as Hell's rampant destruction. It was up to the mortal heroes to defeat evil not in the name of Heaven or the angels, but rather in their capacity as good people, a point about religion I'd considered rather poignant. Making angels and humans allies in the games and turning it into an uncomplicated good vs. evil scenario felt like a step backward for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One other trick is to find out online at what level the item starts dropping (31 in the case of Nemesis Bracers), then powerlevel a throwaway alt to just that level. Whenever your main has blood shards to spend, use the alt to gamble for bracers. At the reduced level there are fewer items capable of receiving, so the odds are greatly stacked. Of course since it's level 31 all you can do is Cube it, but still I've done this trick for level 8 items when only like 2 things can spawn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are 24 set dungeons (4 for each character), each one is found in a different predetermined spot in the world. You can either look it up the location of each online, or puzzle it out for yourself by wearing the set and going to Leoric's Manor in Act I. If you look around, you'll find a pedestal that contains the tome of set dungeons, which you can read to get a clue on how to find it.

Be warned: the set dungeons are very unlike the main game. Mastering them often takes a completely different approach to your endgame build. It takes theorycraft, a solid gameplan, and a whole lot of patience to get through the hardest ones. Luckily every class has at least one that's extremely easy to master. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally I blame the Seinfeld effect. The Barsoom series pre-dates Superman, Lord of the Rings, and every pulp sci-fi adventure that inspired Star Wars, and had elements later used by all of them. It was famously considered unfilmable for most of its history, and by the time the special effects had been invented for it, most modern audiences had already seen everything it had to offer from the things that had ripped it off (if that makes sense). It couldn't help but feel hackneyed and cliche to our eyes, I consider that tragically ironic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on what you want to do. Honestly unless you want to play at the very highest tiers, most builds will do just fine at difficulties up to Torment 10, and most of those will push beyond. Find the skills you have the most fun with, find builds that support those skills, and aim for that. It helps to understand the sets available to you as a Crusader (these are just general descriptions, there's a lot of nuance):

Roland's is good if you like doing lots of damage very fast, but has issues maintaining Wrath

Invoker is for defense-minded players who actually want to be attacked and punish them for doing so

Seeker makes for a close-range AoE build, utilizing Blessed Hammer and Falling Sword to deal slower but more consistent damage relative to Roland's.

Akkhan's is generally considered the weakest set for pushing the highest GR's, but easily supports the widest variety of playstyles; no matter what your preferred skill or weapon set, it will always be helping you quietly in the background.

Finally, Norvald's is a two-piece set that isn't seen often but is designed to help you get around the map on your horse very quickly for speed farming.

Most of the highest players use the Legacy of Nightmares (LoN), two rings that allow for a viable "set-less" build, meaning you just use whatever good legendary stuff you find. The downside is the gear all has to be Ancient for the rings to work, and Ancients are ten times rarer than normal items. Point is, don't feel like you have to stay locked into one build when there are countless ways you can go :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the contrary, my Wings of Mastery stand as mute testament that I have, in fact, tried them :) My point was that set dungeons are unequivocally a new way to play the game. There wasn't a single dungeon that didn't require a significant overhaul to my endgame build for that set. The whole point was to think outside the meta and discover previously overlooked items or skills that suddenly shine in that situation.

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they were merely optional, but they truly are a refreshing change of pace from bounty grinds and pushing GR's. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe I painted the wrong picture here. I was at fault here; I've owned my stupid mistake for years. But for their part, I would argue (as my first sergeant argued to me directly) that it absolutely *was* their responsibility as airmen. This is where military life differs from civilian life; they knew the wingman concept as well as the rest of us. There have been times where I was the guy carrying his drunk buddies home safely, and I'd kick myself if I thought sending them home in a cab alone with no follow-through was a responsible way forward. This night was a lesson to me in exactly what not to do in that situation, and as a result a lot of my friends made it home when there was no one else there for them. I shouldn't have needed the help, but that is *exactly* what wingmen are there for. Rest assured, they knew I was blacked out. I needed honest-to-God help, and I was an inconvenience to at least one of them. That was their choice. 

For what it's worth I ended up having a long conversation with Richard that same day. I apologized to him for the sock thing, we both genuinely felt remorse for what happened that night, and we've been bros ever since. Hell, we've even been drinking together, albeit far more responsibly :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh merciful heaven, where has this sub been all my life?

This happened seven years ago. I was an Airman First Class fresh out of basic/tech school and hadn't been at my first active duty station (Ramstein AFB, Germany) for a week yet. A friend of mine called me over and asked if I wanted to do some shots on the gazebo out behind the dorms. I had only recently turned 21 and kinda wanted to keep my nose clean, but it was 4th of July weekend so I figured why not? I didn't know the guys she was hanging out with but she did and I trusted her. About an hour later I'm good and buzzed on vodka and Disaronno, and the guys are pretty good company. They rope me into going off-base to check out some fireworks (my friend opts out), then we hit the bars in nearby Kaiserslautern. Well, not knowing my limits, I blacked out after several more drinks and, probably understanding that the sensible level-headed thing to do would be to cut the night off early to make sure my stupid ass got back on base, they opted instead to send me sailing home in a cab with a song and a belly full of Wild Irish Rose.

Now, the gate guards at that time used a system where they scan your ID and made sure you were in the database, but since I was so new I hadn't been enrolled yet. This could have been easily explained with no harm, but as I was unconscious and no one was present to vouch for me, the driver got turned away and took me instead to the regional hospital. My first sergeant (who had yet to meet me) was contacted and came to pick me up, completely slam damn hammered on a hospital bed with an IV in my arm, a catheter in my dick, and a 150 cab tab for vomiting on the upholstery. Great first impression -_-

Anyway, I survived that debacle and put up with being a laughingstock for a couple of weeks, turning into a productive member of my workshop. Unfortunately, brain scrambled as it was that night I couldn't recall who exactly had ditched me. Over time I learned to laugh about it and turned it into a cautionary tale about knowing the people with whom you get shit-faced.

Fast forward several months, I find myself on bay orderly (dorm/barracks cleanup) duty with this other guy we'll call Airman Richard. We were picking up trash outside, and at one point we encounter possibly the nastiest sock you've ever seen; soaked from the rain, incrusted with mold, and smelling like a box of spoiled milk came down with a stomach virus. For whatever reason the normally thick-skinned Richard just couldn't even look at the thing without dry-heaving. Whatever, I pick it up with the little grabbo-arm thing and set it in the trash. 

We headed off to the dumpster and through our conversation I found myself prompted to relate my drinking story. He tells me "Shit, that was you, la_pork? Yeah man, haha you were pretty trashed, what happened after?" Suddenly Airman Richard is looking more like an Airman Dick. We reach the dumpster but I have yet to tie off the trashbag with that gross sock in it.

Yeah, you can guess what happened next.

Before I even knew what I was doing I reached in the bag with that trusty grabbo-arm, pulled out the sock and smacked him right in his slightly upward-facing mouth and nostrils with an accompanying wet slap like a freshly caught salmon. And friend, you'd think I laced it with ipecac, the near-instantaneous way he reacted. He blew chunks of his lunch all over the bushes and one poor guy's windowsill. I suspect the stank had caught in his mustache so he couldn't even breathe in without inducing even more vomiting. It was like the negative feedback loop from Hell; he was on the ground for probably ten whole minutes until it seemed like there was simply nothing left for his stomach to purge.

And through it all, I just stood there, marveling at his good fortune that he had someone to make sure he got back to his room safely.

TL;DR- Jackass left me blackout wasted and in trouble with my boss, received retribution months later with a gross sock to the face. </TEXT>
