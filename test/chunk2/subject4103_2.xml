Atheists see meaningless slabs of meat being naturally selected to die."

Your mileage may vary, since you're talking about people and not categories. People react differently and with different motivations. </TEXT>

What's important is that you're happy with the way you look, but if you're at all worried that guys won't find you attractive the way you look right now, don't be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are many different styles here, and while some are more attractive than others, they all look good. Your friends are not the crazy ones here. As for why you don't get asked out, you definitely give off a quirky vibe, which a lot of guys don't go for. You seem like you'd be into geeky interests, and while a lot of guys are VERY into that, they tend toward being either creepers or too nervous to approach an attractive girl like you. But I could be totally off-base about your interests; if so ignore that. Whatever the reason that you don't get asked out, it certainly isn't your looks. Unless guys feel too intimidated to approach - then it might be your looks actually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've definitely leveled up in terms of your sex appeal to the average guy. I personally agree that your earlier pictures gave off more of a cute/pretty vibe and the more recent ones show a sexier side that wasn't really present before. The important thing, though, is how you feel about your own look. You shouldn't feel insecure about being girly and sexy, since you can definitely pull it off when you try. If you prefer a more androgynous look though, then that's just your personal preference and it's perfectly fine. If you want, you can pull out the more feminine side when you're in the mood for that. I think you are very attractive and at this point you may just be too intimidating for most guys to hit on, but if those later pictures are any indication, they're definitely interested. Ignore the unsavory characters from wretched hives of scum and villainy and keep pressing on. You'll do just fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, people learn how to interact with others from their role models. Good for you trying to straighten him out, but if his dad treats people the same way he does, that influence will probably stick with him longer than you verbally slapping sense into him.
