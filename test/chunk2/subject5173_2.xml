	<TEXT> The point they are making is pretty self-explanatory sure, i'm interested in who/where they heard it from since it's one of the most stupid things I have ever heard and afaik these two guys never met and said it on seperate occasions two years or so apart.

also, i'm not sure why you put the word "term" in quotes as though I said it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hitchensian atheist here, i'm curious to know if such an idea would even be possible, assuming a Satanic nation were possible, and if so would the presumption of innocence be in place?, what would the sentences be for people convicted of say....multiple burglaries and what would the sentences be for the worst offenders? (in my view that's people who kill for pleasure, people who rape children/disabled people anyone who is more helpless than most people really, and i'm not overlooking the suffering caused by the rape of able-bodied, sound-minded men/women, i'm just wondering what you think the very worst of the worst should be sentenced to in a Satanic legal system)

live long and prosper :) </TEXT>
