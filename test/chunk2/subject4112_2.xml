	<TEXT> My apologies for the confusion. I generally google search movie titles and go by whatever 2/3 genres are listed which I had always assumed were taken from IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. Fallen is listed as a Thriller/Fanatasy movie on Google searches. I'd never really considered it a "drama" personally.   
  
 I have noticed that there are some discrepancies between sites regarding genre/run times etc. So in the future I'll try to note exactly where I'm getting my genres from to help with clues. Again sorry for any confusion. I'll be posting some more today hopefully. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just rereading an old Rolling Stone interview with Bob Dylan and he was discussing the importance of understanding the music you want to play. He talks about how he was immersed in a folk culture, he lived at a pivotal time where you could see these big names in folk play live all the time. He then proceeds to say that as our society shifts away from this communal musician enviornment and we are more and more distanced from the music, we lose our connection to it. So basically, when people are trying to write folk songs/love songs, they end up sounding insincere because they are  trying too hard to emulate the sound that they basically don't know anything about.   
In the end, Dylan implies that in order to write a good song that doesn't sound cheesy or cliche that the songwriter should study the old songs and find the secret within those songs. Discover what made the songs sound so authentic when they said "I love you".   
  
There's a special formula for writing songs. You have to tap into that and find the key to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I asked you not to send the same videos so instead you send me an hour and a half extended version of the same bullshit.   
Since you rely so heavily on youtube for all your arguments, look up some raw footage of 9/11 videos...doesn't matter which one, theres plenty to choose from. Look at them all...you'll see a common occurence in them...planes. Big shiny things in the sky. I'd really like to know where you think all the home footage came from...planted evidence?    
The whole point of a conspiracy, especially something as large as 9/11 is to have as few people privy to details as possible. But apparently they abandoned that time tested method and recruited an entire city to lie to the rest of the world.   
I really don't see why you'd choose to latch on to this of all the conspiracies and theories of that day, this whole No planes/No wind vortex is the weakest argument. You spend more energy/time trying to get the evidence to fall into this niche argument than is worth it IMO. I'm starting to question your sanity...and mine for having this conversation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watched all the videos that have been linked on this topic. If that's all it takes to prove something to you undoubtedly, I envy you.  I'm not a scientist so I can't explain to you why you can't see a wind vortex..bad quality video? perhaps at that height and the close proximity to the building changes the effect...I have no clue. However just because I don't see a wind vortex doesn't mean I don't see a plane...because I do see a plane. Seen hundreds of videos 9/11 from all different angles and you know what I've never not seen...a plane. Explain that please. Explain how all these videos  exist and explain to me what people saw if they didn't see planes?   
  
I'd love nothing more than for you to prove 100% that there were no planes that day. Please don't link the same 2 videos as proof.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfounded claims echoing the official narrative  

  
Saying that 2 planes crashed into the WTC is hardly "echoing the official narrative", It's what happened. And calling it "unfounded" is just careless. The why/how/what/who questions are what we should be focusing on.   
  
Instead you're trying to argue that the government, in cahoots with the media , and hundreds, if not more , eye witness accounts and videos, added the planes using CGI effects...  
I'm sorry, but there is no youtube video to convince me that thousands of people imagined seeing planes that day. I personally didn't witness it, however my brother did from about 3 blocks away and I believe him when he tells me what he saw. </TEXT>
