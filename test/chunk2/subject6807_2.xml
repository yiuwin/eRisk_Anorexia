Good thing they are reporting objectively without inserting their bias.

They just don't understand.  Just because we are Mexicans doesn't mean we support illegal immigrants.  Many of us come from hard working  generations that followed the law to become citizens.  We don't appreciate those entitled illegals that expect to be treated like royalty.  You are breaking the law, you are a criminal, and you should go back. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How Hillary Clinton can be a bigot </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-25 20:20:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am half Mexican, so I have a unique experience facing bigots.  I have faced bigotry from  both white people that hated me because of the color of my skin and from minorities when I acted too "white".  Bigotry as defined by Merriam-Webster is "person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance".  Any race, gender, or religion can be a bigot.  All you have to do is hate someone because they belong to a particular group.



So how can Hillary be a bigot?  Does she hate minorities or other groups?  She does, and I'll give you example from how progressives treat minorities.  Progressives do not view minorities as individuals, but part of an entire ethnic group.  Thus, they can say everyone within that group is a victim of the "oppressors" from which progressives can save them!  If an individual from that group states they don't want to be saved and express opinions different than progressives they are immediately vilified/hated.  Progressives are so devoted to the "progressive" opinions and that they actively hate any minorities that won't act as victims.  They judge them purely on their skin color of what they are capable of doing.  This is being "obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices".



So the next time someone laughs/scoffs at Hillary Clinton being called a "bigot", just know they have their own bigotry they are hiding behind their progressive ideals  </TEXT>

"In most places people think that it is the woman who holds the blame for the rape. And it is reasonable that immigrants take with them such attitudes when they flee here to the country," says the professor, who herself has lived many years in Muslim land.
