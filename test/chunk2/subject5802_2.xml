	<TEXT> Although it pains me to say it as a Titans fan I don't think so.  He will go down as a good QB who went to a few pro bowls and made some deep playoff runs, but he won't be a HoF type player.  He's too injury prone and doesn't have a good enough deep ball  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AAU is ruining basketball.  Many of the top NBA coaches and players are saying that these days.  AAU doesn't teach fundamentals of the game.  It's all about who is the most athletic.  It's the opposite of what we need in soccer.  

Also like I said high school football coaches are wayyyyy better coaches than their contemporaries in other high school sports.  I've been around AAU basketball, high level club soccer, and high level high school football, and the HS football coaches are usually better at Xs and Os and have a better understanding of their game than the others.  That's probably just a product of football being by far the most popular sport in America.  More popularity = more competition which = better coaching  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How does football not have nothing to teach us?  Football in high school and middle school generally have the best coaches of any sport at the same level.  A lot of football coaches are smart (obviously there are a lot there aren't but it's less than other sports at that age). The biggest problem we have right now is poor coaching.  Mimicking football, which generally has pretty great coaches for high school age kids, would be a good thing.  

Don't mistake me for saying that there aren't good soccer coaches because there are, but in my experiences most high school soccer coaches are just the only teacher that played high school soccer.  Opposed to the football coach who most of the time played in college and has a good mind of the game.  

Also don't mistake me  for making this a race thing by saying "inner city blacks" and "corn fed whites."  Basically all I'm saying is that people from poorer places generally make better athletes for a plethora of reasons, regardless of race.  That's why you got so many NBA players that are from inner cities and NFL players from small towns like Hattiesburg, Mississippi, etc.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His shows are fantastic.  I don't really know why I love them so much, maybe it's because he's such a good story teller and he brings a unique approach to history.  Anyway what other podcasts would you suggest that are similar?  Most of the other ones I've listened to are either extremely boring (Sorry Mike Duncan people) or awkward people trying to hard to be entertaining  </TEXT>

I played football at the same college as him, Tusculum College, in Greeneville, TN.  It's not often guys come from my team to the NFL so it's always cool for us.  He was on the steelers practice squad the last 2 years.  He has all the tools physically, 6'6 280 and quick as lightning.  He just needs some refining with some technique and he could definitely be a starter for us.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why is there a lack of parity in the NBA, by American standards? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-21 07:26:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> NBA has had 6 (3 of those being Lebron James) teams win championships since 1999

NFL has had 11 teams win the super bowl since 1999

MLB has had 11 teams win the World Series since 1999

NHL has had 11 teams win the Stanley cup since 199

MLS has had 10 MLS Cup winners since 1999

Why the lack of parity in the NBA? Another big difference is a team in the NFL can literally go from the worst team to a contender.  That doesn't happen in the NBA.  For the most part the teams that are bad stay bad.  NFL has a few bottom feeders, but every team except the Browns have had recent success.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll start by saying Fallout 4 is a good game, but it's not a good Fallout game in my opinion.  

There are a lot of examples of this but the biggest one to me is the Dunwhich Mine.  So after descending hundreds of feet, killing dozens of Raiders, and hearing the growls of an ancient beast, you get to the bottom and find a puddle of water with a knife and some power armor.  I was expecting a super powerful weapon, a big monster to fight, or a quest but no I got a knife.  

A ton of the locations in the game are just empty with nothing of note at all.  The ones that do are just full of bullet sponge super mutants or raiders with a safe that has 50 bullets and some duct tape in it.  

Does anybody else feel the same way?

	<TITLE> I think the new update made it harder to run the ball </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-17 16:01:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before this update a week or two ago I was consistently able to rush for 200+ yards every game.  I run a bunch of running plays, I don't just line up in Hulk and run power O every time, I have a legitimate scheme.  I understand to check to passes when my opponent loads the box and what not.  The strategy part isn't the issue.  

My OL gets blown up every single play.  Anytime I play a team that has a pro bowl level DT, he gets off the block in 1 nano second and tackles me for a 1 yard gain.  So I'll try running outside with counters, powers, stretches, or tosses and encounter the same result.  My TE or T will get blown off the ball and they never reach block their man so I have to cut it up almost every play, which in madden means you get 3 yards at most.  A lot of times I'll have my opponent outnumbered in the box 6 to 5 or 5 to 4 and run a simple inside zone or iso play and my entire OL gets no push and I get tackled for 2 yards.  It makes no sense.  

Because of my recent failures running the ball on normal plays I've thrown in a few wrinkles like running read and triple option but we all know in madden those are really difficult to work because the read man will tackle the give and the keep read. 

Has anybody else not been able to run the ball at all since the new update?  My OL gets mauled every single play since it and only way I gain a lot of yards is if my RB breaks a bunch of tackles.  I've played with a bunch of teams so that's the issue  </TEXT>
