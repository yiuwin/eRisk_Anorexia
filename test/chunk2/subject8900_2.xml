	<TEXT> It's the Innisfree Orchid Gel Cream (i think is a new line or not old at least). I was looking for a fresh and not thick moisturizer for day-time that had some anti aging properties and this one seemed to be the one. I just tried it the back of my hand a few minutes ago and as far as I can tell it feels so fresh, not sticky and smells great! :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Skin Concerns] Allergy or sensitivity? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-15 01:01:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't know what's happening to my skin. I started having severe sensitivity to everything I used (regular products and some new I bought about a month ago). 
About nine cysts popped out suddenly and everything itched. I stopped everything, I went to the dermatologist, he prescribed me Epiduo, Eridosis and Heliocare sunscreen and told me to keep using my gel cleanser (Corsx Good Morning low ph) and toner (Klairs preparation toner) (He didn't know this two products, I brought them to consultation for him to see the ingredients, said it was ok). 

I have been having problems remuving my sunscreen because oil based cleanser seemed to be what was causing the problem in the first place, so I went back to my old Avene micellar water and Lullage acnextreme gel cleanser. 

Long story short, when it seems to be improving, it gets worst, and today I'm freaking out. I applied my current routine to clean my face and then Klairs toner (20 min), Eridosis (20 min) and Epiduo (10 min), but I'd noticed today that my skin what's completely peeling, so I thought "I need some moisturizing right now", so after Epiduo I applied a bit of Effaclair Duo (La Roche Posay) that the pharmacist gave me as a sample, telling me it was completely safe and non-comedogenic, and now my face is burning, red, and super itchy. I'm applying Avene Purifing water now and then to see if it makes my skin itches a little less, but there has been an hour or more and nothing makes it better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be extremely tired all the time. There was a point when I couldn't even walk up the stairs without stopping a few times and stopped working. Since march I cut carbs, I later started a strictly ketogenic diet and now I feel much better, I'm even swimming one hour every morning and I took my hormones test last week and they are in optimal range. I'm now going to start taking d-chyro-inositol and see how it goes. I'm sure most of my problems are a consequence of PCOS, even the anxiety and insomnia. You're not alone at all! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much! In fact, I applied yesterday night and this morning it had visibly improved. I will see how it goes tomorrow morning, but so far so good. I thought after the mess I made it was best to see the doctor, even if it may sound a little silly to go for a "pimple" it had a bad appearance and I really didn't want to improvise (as I often do), now I'm happy, :) Thanks for your wishes, very kind! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I,m looking for a cream/balm cleanser for oily/acne prone skin and for what I,ve been reading many people recommend "Albolene", I think I,m gonna try it. In CosDna it has so low acne triggers. I,ve read about "Ponds cold cream" too and in I saw the "Bioderma balm-in-oil that seems nice but it has some components I don,t like. About asian products, I have use "Tonymoly Aquaporin sherbet cleanser" very nice and cheap but broke me put, same as "Banila Co. clean it zero". A redditor recommended me this last in the "purity" version, but I,m kind scared my face is quite bad atcthe moment due to banila co. (I,m super sensitive anyway) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello,

I,m so stressed trying to build a skincare routine. I have oily, sensitive acne-prone skin and I,ve been having reactions to cleansers. The issue is that I tried banila co. clean it zero classic and I loved how it removes my make up but it gave broke me out. Since then I,ve been considering if doing OCM is for me.

 I bought pure jojoba oil and I don,t feel it really clean my face like I would like, neither my usual micellar water (I have Avene and Garnier for sensitive skin) so I,ve been considering an DIY balm that a nice redditor recommended me but I live in Europe and products  takes forever to arrive. I dont know neither if buying the banila co. clean it purity or try a cleanser specificaly for acne prone skin. I have been reading reviews and I see CeraVe is very popular, and Neutrogena, do you have any advise? And if any of you are in Europe, do you now a really good makeup remover and cleanser to buy here?

I use Corsx Good morning low ph gel cleanser after jojoba/micellar.

	<TEXT> My mum (58) has been experiencing hair loss for a while. Her blood tests are fine and she has no health issues, but she is loosing weight doing keto diet. She has dyed hair (to cover white), naturally dark brown and otherwise a little bit oily but normal. I think she overwash it (every other day). 

Could you recommend shampoo or remedies, serum, pure oils or masks, or supplements to help her?

	<TEXT> I think what could broke me put is Butylene Glycol or the mineral oil itself. I was using Banila co. clean it zero and broke me put badly,  I switched to Jojoba oil to clean and it doesn,t do its job nearly as well so I came back to my usual Avene Micellar water that really takes forever with cotton pads to remove everything and I still feelmy face isn,t clean. I want to make a full routine but right now I think is better to wait until my face, cleared up. At this moment I,m using 
-Avene micellar water
-Corsx Good morning low ph gel cleanser (with konjac sponge, )
-Klairs preparing toner
-Neostrata Exfoliating gel Salycilic Acid Aha 15 (twice a week)
-Epiduo (at night)
-Mizon pink powder (for the spots at night)
-Heliocare sunblock (50) 

I used my mum's Tonymoly Aquaporin Sherbet cleanser twice during a week I came to visit and it broke me out badly.

My main concern right now is to do a good cleansing and I was really happy when I first try the dpuble clenaser, it makes me sad to have yo stop doing it.

	<TEXT> Definitely oil cleansers. I was using banila co. clean it zero and it has to be either Butylene Glycol or the mineral oil itself. Later I switch to pure jojoba oil that helps a bit as make up remover but not far as effective. Both broke me out. But since I,m using only micelar water (Avene) it seems to be fine. I,m currently using 
- Avene miscelar water
-Good morning low ph Corsx gel cleanser
-Klairs preoaring toner
-Neostrata AHa Salycilic acid exfoliating gel 15 (twice a week)
-Epiduo (at night)
-Mizon pink powder (at night for the spots)
-Heliocare sunscreen (50) 

I,m waiting to the cysts to stop and heal to introduce my routine. I bought a lot of products but I,m afraid of bteaking out with anything. My skin is worsening in terms of hidratation but I passed from 9 cysts to 4 in two weeks with this routine. What I,m really looking for right now is for a goos oil cleanser because I don,t feel my face get propoerly cleansed with just micellar and gel cleanser... I tried my mum,s Tonymoly Sherbet cleanser and it broke me out badly too.
