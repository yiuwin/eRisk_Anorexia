	<TEXT> Overall good pet, fun to hold and to watch for hours on end. Lots of maintenance to think about though, both in feeding, cage cleaning, and dealing with a heat lamp. Also, so many care steps means getting someone to take care of it while on vacation is tricky as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Codingbat is really good for "method" practice, especially since you type right in the browser without any help from an IDE, but it doesn't help with classes, inheritance, polymorphism, or anything beyond what a single method can achieve. There are hilarious "epic progress graphs" where you can see someone who attempted a certain problem for days or weeks at a time failing over and over again, it's a nice touch from the developer to include that. I will look at codeabbey since I do need "learning by example" to really get unstuck from my current Java skill level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This actually works 100% of the time for 30 second pick removal!
1. With the guitar flat on its back (strings up), shake the guitar to get the pick into the middle (just like your photo). 
2. CAREFULLY Swing the guitar around above your head keeping the strings facing you in a way that puts centrifugal force on the pick keeping it in the center until the top, then when you stop it may fall out through the hole and you're done. Much like a kid on a swingset who swings too high, the falls down.
3. If it doesn't fall out, at least it's close to the hole, so just bounce it around toward the hole for a few seconds to see if you were close. If not, repeat step 2! If I get enough upvotes I'll make a video of this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are some questions to ask: "Would I care about this photo in 10 years?". If you assume no to that question until you see a good one, flag it, and keep the flagged ones only. If you are worried about changing you mind, put all the rejects into a separate folder, in a place you go to when you need to free up space. Then a reject has a chance of being resurrected as long as you haven't deleted the rejects folder it lives in. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> LPT: When culling a large set of photos, review them in reverse order (newest photos first). You usually only keep the last one you took in any group of repeats. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> BONUS TIP: If you have a large set of photos and you need to get rid of more than half, use an "opt in" process where you only keep the ones you flag instead of "opt out" where you delete the ones you don't want. A great tool for this is Photo Mechanic (not free, but worth it).
