	<TEXT> Yeah, a lot of people like to copy off what they see without a second thought, so only the creators or the people that legitimately care know what makes a build good or how to improve on it. (Just one of my pet peeves). WHY CAN'T EVERYONE CARE? ;-;

Edit: No, instead change out one of the Art TP gain augs for the nullify ether reflect and find an armor piece with Extend OD count to help with sustaining infinite overdrive(assuming that ur doing ether blossom) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The general consensus from here and GameFAQ's is to use Weapon Attack Power Up XX. i personally use WAP XX and see around 1 million damage per hit on Blossom Dance, in some cases. Ether damage is already augmented heavily by Core Crusher so I don't see the point in wasting three augment slots on 150% more ether damage when you could have 300% more weapon damage, in this case Ether weapon damage, and Melee Attack Up/Boost is for lower damage weapons IMO. Anything above 300 or so should use Weapon Attack Power Up, as your damage will benefit more from it. (Note: Your Melee attack stat wont increase at all, but trust me, the adds are definitely there). </TEXT>
