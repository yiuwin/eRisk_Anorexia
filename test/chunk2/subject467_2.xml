	<TEXT> I work for a well TV studio that makes "documentaries" for most of the major channels here in the UK and you would be shocked just how much is changed by this method. 

It all relies on the fact that you only need to hear exactly what the contributor (person on screen) is saying at the time if we can see their lips moving. This is called "sync" we cover up cuts in the sync with cutaways of anything from pictures relating to what they are talking about or reaction shots of others to shots of their hands gesticulating or something completely unrelated.

The way it works is we take the sync, say an hours worth of un-cut footage, and then have it transcribed word for word with timecodes for each sentence. Someone will then read through this and highlight the bits that tell the story more or less how we want to tell it. For further control these highlighted sections will then be re-arranged to fit exactly what we want to say and the editor (me) will cut these bits according to the timecode and lay them down in an order that makes sense.

There are a couple of reasons for this. In 'throwaway' obdoc television such as "Teen mom" and the like it will be because the stuff they filmed is so dull and trite that its absolutely necessary to keep up some momentum for the drama and give enough shocks per minute, they wont have had enough time to film enough drama that may have arisen so it must be constructed. Often what people say is just too long, too wordy or just plain badly worded. And finally television is all about time limits; its all well and good filming an hour and a half of interview but if all you have is a 50 min program after ad breaks then it has to be cut down somehow.

Generally the higher 'quality' a TV show is the better they will be at hiding their edits and will be less ruthless when going about it to retain more of a semblance of what was said originally.

-

Things to look out for:

Un-naturally short pauses - this will be when the person said a word directly before another that was cut.

Wierd shifts in volume - often the only way to soften some cuts is to fade the volume in or out or both.

Poitnless cutaways - the producers ran out of things to cut to and ended up using the contents of the contributor's pockets.

-

Anyway i'm not sure why i just typed all that out, maybe i've just been reading too much r/depthhub recently. Anyway, hope someone finds it vaguely interesting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Transport. As with many comments in this thread talking about fossil fuels our current paradigm in regards to personal transport is just ridiculous.

Next time you're sitting in traffic; count how many cars you can see with just one person sitting in them going to roughly the same place. 

Its clear we are at a point where we are having to get pretty creative to squeeze the last drops of fossil fuels out of out of our planet. So what then? 

Personally i look forward to it, as a self righteous bike rider it will be pretty amusing to see all the fatties trying to get to work under their own steam. </TEXT>

Usually a bit of barking ensues and the cat scampers off. This cat however was particularly slow that day and whippets are often known for their extreme acceleration.

So the dog literally bites the cat in two and thrashes it about sending kitty blood and guts flying in all directions. We were told this rendition of the story by the friend but the daughters rendition is much more vivid and wild eyed with every few words punctuated by "awesome!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My second grow is grinding along slowly after moving to a different part of town; there are ridiculous amounts of salts building up in the soil from the water. As seen by the whiteish powder on the top of the soil of all the plants in my house. So after multitudes of problems with my various herbs, bonsai and trees I'm adding a water distiller to my kit list and will flush with that to re-balance the PH before carrying on with the grow with the distilled water. 

For nutes I'll use something like [this](http://www.greenshorticulture.co.uk/categories/Plant-Nutrition/Growth-Technology/Ionic-Soil/) but I'm wondering if I'll have to add anything else that the plants will be missing due to the pure distilled water? 

I imagine a few of you use distilled water so i would be interested to know what your PH comes out as and what you add before feeding! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 23. At work I find myself and co-workers use the word "dude" and "man" quite a lot. eg, "Hey man, did you watch that thingy? I liked how that one dude talked about the other thingy."

I have started wondering if these, and other words or phrases are a part of the language I and others will continue to use while the younger generations come up with new slang and neologisms?

So I ask this to you Reddit: what outdated words and idioms do you use day to day. I imagine it would help if you stated your age too so we can get an idea of what different generations articulate amongst their peers.

I'm less interested in colloquialisms based on geography but i guess that could be intriguing! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The christmas just gone I got one present: a medium sized tin full of mediocre tea bags. To put things in perspective i had made everyone who was there (8 or so family members) each a box of fudge (i made the fudge and the custom box). I happen to be a fucking god when it comes to making edibles so with the fat i also did the whole Christmas and boxing day dinners i think they felt a little bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know what you mean. Its when documentaries do this so obviously that i get furious. I now work for a TV production company making "obdocs" and "lifestyle documentaries" which are the worst offenders for this. 

We take an hour long interview that we need maybe 7 minutes from and transcribe the whole thing. Someone then highlights the lines we want and rewrites the whole thing (with timecodes) so we have the contributor saying exactly what we want. then, not unlike [Cassette Boy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxi6QDwQyLU) we cut out the lines we want from the IV and edit them together masking over the gaps with GV's, cutaways and other shots.

Of course this is necessary but when you entirely change the message behind what the conrib' was saying it grinds my gears a bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 99% certain its a fairly famous quote from somewhere. I like to think of it in the way Derren Brown describes (paraphrasing as i dont have the actual quote at work):

"We all view our lives like a theater production, we are the main character while other characters come on stage at different points in the acts to play out their parts. Some characters play big parts where we feel strong emotional connections and others are smaller parts that serve as little more than back-story or filler. No matter the part what they say or do they are simply a part of your story.

What is important to realize is that you yourself are nothing but a character in someone else's play. You may be one of the main features or a bit-part as previously mentioned but the fact remains, when you are 'off-screen' you do not have so much of a part to play."

I find this humbling.

	<TEXT> Preface (might be important): I recently split up with my Ex (lets call her Lara) about 2 months ago due to moving city but things haven't been exactly finished and while we still have feelings for each other we have mutually decided to see other people.

Last night i was with a beautiful girl (lest call her Ella) i have seen four times, taken her for drinks, out to comedy and even used my wildcard; my michelan star cooking skills. With the perfect evening planned out one thing lead to another and we were eventually naked and getting heavy for about an hour before we got to the main event. All well and good except despite the fact a beautiful girl was sprawled out naked on my bed I was soft like jelly. Not through lack of confidence, hornyness or experience; something had switched in my brain and no amount of encouragement could bring me back on track. We cuddled, carried on being playful and she stayed the night. She was really good about it but walking her home this morning it was of course a little awkward not knowing how to put things or be convincingly assuring that it wasn't her.

Talking through things with my housemate we came to the conclusion that it was because things seem a little *unfinished* with Lara, we were together for four years and I've only had two sexual partners until now. This eases things for me slightly but hardly seems fair to Ella. 

I regret that i left things a little confused and cryptic this morning as i didn't really know what to say to make things better, and I'm more than a little worried the same thing will happen next time. Sorry for the long post but this is a new one for me and I'm hoping there are some souls out there that have been in my shoes! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My name is Matthew Cooksey and I currently work for a production company as Assistant Editor and Graphics Artist in the UK. I have credits on a wide range of international broadcast productions and I feel very strongly about this cause.

Now I'm not sure where everything is up to with the video currently so I'm posting here in a hope that enough people will see it and I will be pointed in the right direction. I have plenty of ideas but they are best saved for a forum more suited to directed discussion in regards to the pre and post-production.

[My slightly out of date Vimeo Page](http://vimeo.com/mattcooksey)

Links to promos i have produced over the past few weeks (all editing and graphics by me):

["Aspen Avalanche Rescue"](http://www.back2back.tv/media/promos/aspenavalancherescue/)

["Health Today"](http://www.back2back.tv/media/promos/health_today/)

["The man Who Doesnt Breathe"](http://www.back2back.tv/media/promos/themanwhodoesntbreathe/cut1/)

["John Ogdon"](http://back2back.tv/media/promos/ogdon/final/)

I hope i can be of some help, i've been working in TV for a little while so I have a fairly good idea of how to get things out with layer of shiny TV polish!
