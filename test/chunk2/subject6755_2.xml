	<TEXT> I think it's always more rewarding to read the manga then watch the anime, somewhat similar to watching the original version of a movie before watching a remake. Kinda gives you the feeling of truly understanding the author's emotions and feelings.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very interesting theory, but judging from the latest manga [manga spoilers] (/m "Ymir, who is on terms with Reiner and Berthold, is running away from humanity to saver herself. This brings up the question: which side are Reinger and Berthold on? Most likely with the Ape titan, attacking humanity to save themselves. Maybe when their village was attacked, the whole village agreed to join forces with the Ape titan? Maybe the Ape titan is holding the village captive, and Reiner and Berthold have to accomplish missions dictated by the Ape titan to save them? Anyway, a detail to point out is that the Ape titan allowed Mike to be killed, which shows that the Ape titan has some sort of requirment that needs to be met for supposedly creating titans from humans. Or he is just ruthless, who knows.") </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does look sort of like upside down katakana, but the center character more closely resembles `ko.` Anyway, I was just wondering if there was speculation on any theory behind the text.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Manga Spoilers] The Strange Text? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-14 12:49:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Has anyone made any speculation on the strange text on the sardine can in the castle? (I forget which manga chapter it is in, but when Ymir reads the text for food that the other soldier can`t read). Also the scene with the titan that says "Ymir-sama," or lord Ymir, still intrigues me. Could it be some ancient language, remembered only by some aristocratic line? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel that there`s something amiss here. The  "I would not describe that as MTV putting restrictions on people -- it was up to that artist and their management what they wanted to do" is extremely vague. It even sounds devious honestly. Anyway, the robots are shy, mysterious people anyway, we can`t hate them for putting off a performance on a  relatively small comedy show. Heck, maybe they got a new idea on how to perform and are practicing!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Eren made the assumption that the colossal titan was intelligent when during its second appearance, it specifically attacked that cannons before blowing another hole in the wall. Armin was there as well iirc. I`m not so sure about the armored titan, but the idea that a titan came out of nowhere to accomplish a specific objective also shows intelligence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is stated that there are multiple areas with these giant trees, but if a certain test subject has finished testing, wouldn`t you move to another area? I`m just speculating, of course.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I`m saying that maybe the first titanesque living test subjects were trees, not that titans are trees. Maybe the scientific progression would be trees, [Manga Spoilers](/m "apes"), then humans.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Spoiler] The Giant Tree Forest Theory </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-11 06:30:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Episode 18 just gave me this idea, even though I am currently caught up in the manga. If the idea that the titans are biological creations of science holds true, what if the very first tests were done on plants: Specifically trees. This would explain for why the forest of giant trees seems so  "out of place," as well as the fact that this forest was previously a tourist attraction. Of course, large trees are tourist attractions in the real world, for example the Redwood National Park in California, but the fact that humanity does not have a definitive time period for when titans emerged shows how the trees could eventually become a tourist attraction. Another interesting idea is how titans are so similar to plants (light for energy = photosynthesis, could eating humans be their way of acquiring H2O?). Also, I think it would be an amazing philosophical message how if the beginnings of the titans lie in these giant trees, and that these forests, the  "perfect environment " for 3D maneuver gear thus being the perfect area for killing titans, will lead to the their downfall. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the main messages this anime is trying convey is human laziness. Someone should count how many times Eren compared humans to "cattle." The purpose of the three walls and the colossal titan within the manga/anime is to show how humanity's false sense of security leads to the beginning of their desperate battle against extinction, so I have to disagree with you pet peeve there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It all depends on the kind of vibrato (arm, hand, etc.), but judging by the fact that you have a specific method for practicing your vibrato, there is no other trick than to practice more!  </TEXT>
