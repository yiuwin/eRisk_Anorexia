	<TITLE> The Donut Story </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-09 10:17:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before I write this, I just want to say this is also a popular Imgur submission, but it was copied by my brother onto Imgur, and it was originally posted by my other brother on Facebook. It's been on Imgur for a while now, but I thought I'd share it with Reddit. Here it is:

"So last night, I intended to go to Aldi, but it was closed. On my way back, I passed a Dunkin Donuts, and I saw the employees throwing out a huge bag of donuts. I went over to check on it and it was still warm, so I was like, hell yeah, free donuts!

Ten minutes and three blocks later, here's me with 40 pounds (not an exaggeration) of donuts in my duffel bag, and I felt a little jelly leaking out of one of the corners so I stopped to adjust the donuts. I haven't shaved in a couple days and I'm dressed in old clothes because I was helping my neighbor move some stuff out of her apartment. I have on a hoodie, a beanie, and this huge bag that looks like there could be anything in it. Well, at that exact moment, two police officers drove around the corner, and you can probably 
guess part of what happened next...

Cop: What's in the bag?
Me: Donuts
Cop: Are you fucking with me?
Me (internally): shit
Cop 2: Right, because cops like donuts, right? You think that's funny?
Me: No, really, I have like 40 lbs of donuts in this bag. Do you want to see?
Cop: Yeah, I think I do.

At this point his expression went from mild annoyance to astonishment when I opened up the bag and showed him the plethora of donuts inside.

Cop 1: Do you...where did you...
Cop 2: Where did you get those donuts?
Me: Well they were throwing them out at the Dunkin Donuts and I thought it would be a shame to waste them.
Cop: Are you homeless?
Me (trying really hard to keep a straight face): No sir...I'm a graduate student.

At this point, "astonishment" turned to "disbelief". This was the most surreal police encounter I've ever had in my life. They kept on repeating my story as though they didn't believe me. "So you mean to tell me that you have this huge bag on your back, and you just happened to walk past Dunkin Donuts when they were throwing out all those donuts, so you picked them up. Out of the trash."

I didn't know how to explain to them that this kind of weird shit ONLY HAPPENS TO ME AND NOBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD. They eventually left and wished me luck with my degree, shaking their heads in disbelief.

EPILOGUE: I walked around Clark Park and the surrounding area handing out donuts calling myself Donut Santa. It was the greatest night of my life. I have some in the freezer also. I'm going to eat them now." </TEXT>
