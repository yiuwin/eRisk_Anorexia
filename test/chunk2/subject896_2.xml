	<TEXT> A friend and I were driving through a neighborhood when up ahead we saw a man in his boxers and robe walking out to his mailbox by the edge of the street. As we got closer we noticed he was wearing headphones and totally jamming out. I mean, jumps, kicks, spins, etc. He was so into it that his eyes were closed and he had no idea we were approaching. Just as we start to pass by him, he opens his eyes while mid-air guitar solo. The three of us make eye contact and hold for a moment of pure embarrassment. Realizing he'd been seen the whole time, he gives us the rocker symbol with his hand, sticks out his tongue (a la KISS) and proceeds to rock out. My friend and I thought it was so funny, we joined in as we continued to pass.

Made our day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 20 minutes in, and I still didn't see a discussion thread. Thought I'd start it up.

No spoiler tags needed here, as long as you're discussing something from this episode and back. This is the place to discuss S03E09.
Please take a moment to review the subreddit rules to the right. /r/BoardwalkEmpire operates a bit differently than other TV Show subreddits. We encourage discussion as well as original, quality, BWE-related content, therefore there are some restrictions on what is acceptable to post.
Please no requests for live streams or torrent links. As someone who is forced to torrent the show myself, I feel your pain, but DL sources are not hard to find.
Do you have any ideas or suggestions for this subreddit? Message the moderators and let us know what we can do to make this the best TV show subreddit out there! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in HS, I wore a pair of shoes that had purple shoe laces. Actually, they were light purple (lavender). The vice principal stopped me in the hallway and told me that I'd have to remove them because 'they could be gang colors'. 

Yes, because we all know how dangerous the Lavender Gang can be. 

I told him 'no' and said that it was ridiculous. He called my father who laughed at him and told him the same. 

TLDR: In my HS, lavender shoe laces are probably gang colors.  </TEXT>

And while it's been a year or two since Jimmy's death, I expected Gillian (being ever so close to her son) would be more upset when Jimmy's name is brought up. She has to know that he's dead. He's run off before but this time, she must know, he's dead.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. Manny was a interesting character and he brought a lot to the overall plot of BE. I was absolutely upset about the things his character had done, but that didn't make him any less interesting. I liked him, and I disliked him, simultaneously.
