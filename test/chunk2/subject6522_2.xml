	<TEXT> 10 Cloverfield Lane is a good one. But make sure you've seen the first movie (di mo alam meron no? haha) so you won't feel "weirded" out with the ending. Nevertheless, 10 Cloverfield Lane can still stand on its own as a good psychological thriller. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sense8's a good show but I always just find their title sequence to be lazy. It's literally just a montage of culture's around the world. If I wanted that I would have just watched a travel docu on Nat Geo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Roanoke made quite a rebound this year. It lived up to its "American Horror Story" title. Give it a shot but you'll have to endure the first half of the season as you might not enjoy the narrative format but it still has some good generic scares by AHS standards.  </TEXT>
