	<TITLE> Where to start? I'd like to building a gaming PC as a gift for my partner. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone. Merry Christmas :)

A while back, I posted in another subreddit about what games i should get for my partner who suffers PTSD. I had quite a few recommendations and I ended up getting her a steam account and downloading Stardew Valley which she loves. I've noticed a few games on steam which I would love to play too, but my computer was really not made for gaming. I also want to get her a few more as well.

So...where do I begin? How do I know what parts work with what parts? Should I buy a PC that is pre built? Will I save more if I buy the parts and put them together? Are there any sites/magazines I should be reading?

The last time I built a PC was in 2004 when I worked for a computer store. I'm not a complete newb but it's been a long time for me out of the loop with new technology. I'm also looking at getting two screens because my partner tends to like to read up about stardew valley while she plays the game. We have one right now which I use for work, but its not amazing or anything.

Also, I live in Australia, so a lot of stores don't ship to us, or it's expensive to ship.

Budget is about AUD $1500. I hope this isn't a stupid post, or something that is asked all the time. I'd like to give it as a gift, and I think she would really appreciate it more if she knew that i researched, sourced all the parts and built it myself. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did the same. A rubbish truck scratched the side of my car and I had photos of his licence plate. The cops called who it was registered to and got the ex wife who said she doesn't have contact with him. Nothing progressed from there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just wish people wouldn't jump to conclusions you know? I wasn't there, so I have no idea but it could have been anything. It could have been failed brakes. The truck could have contained something valuable and it was being hijacked and the truck reared off course, or it could have been intentional to kill as many random people as possible. Or the driver could have fallen asleep at the wheel, and didn't stop. I hope for the sake of the people who passed away and their families, they get some answers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She is a funny one. She calls me randomly to ask me questions like "do lesbians really scissor???". "Are you the man in the relationship". We had a long discussion about why she should stop using "gay" as an insult.

She still loves me a lot, and I'm very grateful to her that she's the voice of reason to the rest of my family who aren't cool with it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Essay on being raised as a Muslim and knowing I was a lesbian </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-07 10:31:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A little while ago, someone posted about feeling alone because they were Muslim and also a lesbian. I told them that they weren't alone, and the whole AL community told them they weren't alone. I mentioned I wrote an essay on it a while ago. A few people have messaged me asking for this essay.

I'm [uploading it here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8-9JHBuvQR1cFljamo5S1VLSVk) for anyone that wants to read it. Please remember, it is an essay so there are references in it to readings that you might not have done. But majority of it is my story. I wrote it at uni, and I'm not the best writer, but...you'll get the idea.

Edit: Because I was asked to share, [here is a picture of me when I was a kid](http://imgur.com/a/HxzBf). Yes I know, how could you not know I was a lesbian...that hair, my shirt with the cats on it....

[Here is me now, with my girlfriend](http://imgur.com/a/awTfn). Shes pretty much the smartest, sexiest babe on the planet. And yep, we plan to have caramel babies that both our families will love with all their hearts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for this. Sorry if this seems like a dumb question, but do I fertilize the soil once and then put mulch on? How often do I do this? It's very very hot here, so should I water it once a day after it's been a hot day, or in the morning before it gets too hot? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello r/gardening! I'm new here, only made one post about my cucumbers.

My partner and I purchased a house (In Sydney, Australia) and it came with a lot of trees, one of them being a mango tree. It's currently the start of Summer and I want to make sure we look after it well, so by the end of summer we get some juicy juicy mangos!

Is there anything I should be doing in particular to make this happen? I'm quite new to gardening.

Here are some photos that I took today: http://imgur.com/a/8SVsQ

Thanks!
