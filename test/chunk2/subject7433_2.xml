	<TEXT> There would be no issues with artisans sending their products as gifts (so to answer your question no there is no problem with you sending your USBs as gifts). I don't know if reddit gifts would host this exchange, but if they did the minimum reddit gifts gift value is $20 but if I end up hosting it then there would be no minimum gift value, just give what your happy to give without expecting to get a gift of equal or greater value in return. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I end up contacting reddit gifts and they approve my request for a mechanical keyboards gift exchange then the set amount would be $20 which is the "standard" reddit gifts minimum recommend spend. But if I would have to end up hosting it myself here on r/MK then I would say "just spend as much as your happy to spend without expecting to receive an equal or greater gift in return (for example if your happy to spend $50 on a gift and wouldn't care if you got a $20 gift in return then do it but if you are only doing it to get a $50+ gift in return then don't do it)". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe these are more spare keys instead of manufacturing rejects like the last round of "crap bags"?

EDIT: I read the description of the product and it said something about winning a $150 gift card or something. So yeah it's probably still all "crap" like last time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have fixed the form issue, so please feel free to use it now :)

The reason for this seperation is to make sure that 60% users don't have to pay $100 for a kit that should only be costing them around $60. Here are the two quotes so that you can see the price differences:
[original](http://i.imgur.com/rDIeJQJ.jpg)
[current](http://i.imgur.com/wastssL.jpg)
the original sets had the same base but the mods supported tkl and 100%, but meant that 60% users had to pay full price and have an extra 40 keys that they had no use for.

Hope this clears some things up.

	<TEXT> Thanks for your suggestion.
I can see where your coming from in terms of not having to pay for extra keys, but if I include the extra Planck alpha keys in the base set, then all the "standard" 60/80/100% users are paying extra for keys that they would not normally be using. I'm going to have to modify some of the sets any way so I will do just a Planck mods set along with a modified base set and get a quote from signtaure plastics to see the price difference, if any. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi,
Thanks for your feedback!

I contacted Massdrop a few weeks back and they replied saying that if sales wanted to sell this set then they would get back to me, but I still haven't gotten a reply. So I will probably end up having to run it myself either on Geekhack or here.

	<TEXT> Hey r/MK,
You may or may not have seen my IC, so if you haven't heres the link:
https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/549hs6/ic_mint_dsa/

Well, between here and Geekhack, I have received a bit of interest for the kit, So I have sent a quote to Signature Plastics, and when I get the quote back I will hopefully do a group buy.

So, I am wondering if anyone here has ever done a group buy on either here or mass drop, and would be wiling to tell me how you set up a group buy.

Thanks r/MK for all of your feedback and comments.
