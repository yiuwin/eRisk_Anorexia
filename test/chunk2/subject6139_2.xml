In fact it is probably way better for him to ask the people of this sub with serious knowledge than to just google shit in hopes of figuring it out 
Maybe you shouldn't be on this sub if you're going to be an elitist jerk. 
This is a place where people can come and find help when they need it so that they CAN be safe 
Not a place that they get bashed for asking the same questions that have gone through your head at some point

that is the tracking info saying that my package had been delivered 
i sent it and it said it was delivered. thats all i have control over
if this was all just a big mistake then i am very sorry for overreacting but i asked for a response several times just to let me know what was up and then i told you if you didnt respond i was assuming you were messing with me because i had gotten no response, even though you were obviously on reddit 
once again im sorry if this is all a misunderstanding, but youve gotta be able to see where im coming from

as far as your "proof" that is just a receipt of SOMETHING being sent 
it doesnt say where or to who it is being sent to. 
if you really did sent it to me and are not scamming me then it should be here and its not  
and you didnt respond to any of my pms asking for updates or tracking info 
i got no response at all

	<TEXT> Ah 
Okay, so you have either a ce4 or a ce5 (I can't really tell from the pic) 
They aren't the best clearomizers in the world but for a beginner they do well with getting your feet wet until you decide to upgrade or not. 
Basically there are two categories of clearo, a top coil clearo: This type of clearomizers has an atomizer that is located at the top of the chamber, (where the wicks are leading to) the wicks then pull the liquid into a coil that heats the liquid and vaporizes it, and bottom coil devices: basically the same thing except the coil is on the bottom of the chamber. 
The differences are actually pretty significant. 
In top coil devices I've noticed you get more dry hits(not enough liquid making contact with the coil so it burns the wick) than in a bottom coil because of the way that the coils and wicking systems are engineered. 
Also with bottom coil devices you won't have to refill as often because you can pretty much get every drop of your juice as opposed to having to refill every time your liquid gets below your wick in a top coil device. 
Hope this helps! 
Let me know if you have any other questions, I'd be glad to help a noob;)

	<TEXT> Hello there! 
I was the winner of the "Twisted Tuesday" give away that r/twistedcigs did a few weeks ago and my package just came in! 
Let me just say that the customer service was amazing! 
They announced the winners on Tuesday and he pm'ed me at about 10am. The package shipped out THE SAME DAY and he gave me a tracking number merely a few hours later! 
they got here yesterday morning and I was super impressed with the packaging! 
So far my favorite flavor was the unreleased flavor, but I'm really excited to try all four and do a review of them on here! 
Very pleased with my experience! Thank you once again r/twistedcigs </TEXT>

Try unscrewing your positive post until it is barely poking out of the threads 
That will make it sit lower on your mods </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seconded 
Flavors taste wayyyyyyyyyyy better when smoking some bud. Plus it covers the smell in your mouth so you don't have to worry about your breath smelling like weed </TEXT>
