	<TEXT> As the first wave of these new marathons is almost over I would wait and start with week 11 which is the beginning of wave 2. I would probably start with one of the higher odd marathons like Fans choice or film quotes. 

New marathons most likely wont start until the current 30 week marathons end, and probably not right away after that.


the only way to get the award is to have all 10 of the same variant.

The First Order at the beginning of The Force Awakens is not a declared "enemy" of the Republic. At some point between ROTJ and TFA  Leia sees them for what they are and is given approval by the Republic to start The Resistance. </TEXT>

I'm no hand writing expert but I'm pretty sure this eBay listing of a signed copy of WTTKH is a forgery and not a very good one. Surprisingly the person/store selling it has 100% positive feedback. Remember folks do your due diligence and research before buying on Ebay. Let me know what you think I could be totally wrong about the SIG. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just for fun I thought since we now have a good idea (based on rumors and leaks) what the opening of The Force Awakens will be about, we could give a stab at what we think the opening crawl might be. I'll go first...


It is a time of COLD WAR. The remnants of the GALACTIC EMPIRE have splintered off into the FIRST ORDER, have built a new SUPER WEAPON and waged their first battle against THE RESISTANCE...

The RESISTANCE has approved construction of an even more DEADLY WEAPON to counter the FIRST ORDERS attacks but it may not be enough...

QUEEN LEIA SOLO has dispatched POE DAMERON hero of the RESISTANCE to the outer rim planet of JAKKU to retrieve a long lost JEDI relic in hopes it will draw out the help they need from hiding... </TEXT>
