	<TEXT> You are a good looking chap, but there isn't any picture there that there is only you, you can start with that. The only one I'd keep is the one riding the horse, it shows a hobby (if you have a pic of you riding alone would be best). If you want to be shirtless, go to the beach or to a swimming pool, show some landscape with you on it.

Bio fulfils its job, it isn't outstanding, but won't make women roll their eyes, so I'd keep it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd pick a better main picture, specially with no sunglasses and without doing that thing with your neck; #2 even though there is a nice landscape, we can't see your face, would change it for another, but if you don't have a picture with a nice landscape at all, keep it; #3 is dumb, remove it; #6 I assume that you know how to fly, if you don't remove; #5 I know that some pets might not like to be real close to their owners, but you must have a pic that you are closer, that huge gap between you is disturbing/ #4 not quite sure what you're trying to accomplish with that picture because I can't read, so I can't comment, if it is smething related to volunteering and it is plain to see, great.

Bio: some people might find cute, do you want to sound cute on tinder? </TEXT>

I didn't like the "to find out even more swipe right!", to me it shouts "PICK ME! PICK ME!", I'd go with just the first part. </TEXT>

Is there a nice landscape around where you live? You should try taking a picture there. Also would change completely your bio, you can talk about pokemon, it would make your potential radius smaller, but try to talk like you aren't desperate, because that is how you sound </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mate, I'd be glad to give you a hand, but post the pictures on imgur.

Edit: In Imgur order, I'd remove #3, even though you look good on it, the background is too dark, it doesn't help. Fifth, and your main picture, should be changed, you can keep this picture, it looks really good, but it's not the best picture to be on your cover, I'd go for something "more you" and less "background", kinda like number one, even though it's not that good. Fourth is okay, do you usually have beards? If you don't I'd remove it also, something I personally would use, like selfies, limit the number of pictures with friends to one. By the way, I like the fact that you added a hobby, if playing air hockey is your thing, I'd also invest in better quality pictures.

Now... what about the bio? Don't you have one? I'd write one if I were you, and remember, make it light, make it simple, some people go over the top to make a bio and end up with nothing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you using tinder on Germany as well? I think that your profile line would work poorly in the US, but Germany has a pretty strong reputation on how, let's say, "rough" your women are, so I'd drop it. I consider it kinda cringy too, keep it light, keep it simple.
I like your first picture, but not that much about the rest. Second one I have a thing against dressing formal on tinder, just personal opinion; third, that pose isn't interesting and the fourth one, it could be anyone, you are just showing NIKE, is that an ad?
Show things that you love, do you like sports? Put a picture of you playing or maybe an instrument. Have you gone to somewhere nice? Idk, France, Poland, it doesn't matter, as long as the place is nice.

About the chubby thing, I'd say is an optical illusion, it seems you have a double chin, but you don't, if that makes you feel uncomfortable, though, change the pic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Use a first line that would catch the other person attention, my main tip is to use something funny. I like your pictures, they are pretty well done, the fourth one, the one that you are singing, I wouldn't erase your friend's face, only if he's like a Brad Pitt or something. However there is a problem with your pictures, they look like you are trying to get in in a modelling agency, they don't seem natural, the funny thing, though, is that the fourth one is the most spontaneous and the most appealing of your pictures. Try to add one picture of your hobbies or a picture of you in one of your trips. </TEXT>

If you do use it as a main picture, you can be wearing those glasses on the other pictures, also your current main picture isn't really good, the second is okay, keep one selfie.

Please remove that Sponge Bob quote, you are doing yourself a favour. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, your tinder profile is supposed to be about you and things that people will be attracted towards you, e.g. playing a sport, an instrument, on a trip. It is okay to have pictures with you friends, some people even do that - as you can see while swiping -, but bear in mind that you want to call their attention to yourself and not to your friend(s) because that other person will be dating you and not you and your friend(s). It is not prohibited though, you can keep it, if you want, just my pov, mate! </TEXT>

IMO must have: AC I, AC II, AC Re, AC III (AC Liberation had this clothing thing that I thought was awesome and you were able to go to real swamps, find alligators, if you are not interested in that you can skip it), AC IV, AC Ro

I don't particularly like AC B, AC U and AC S; AC FC is meh, can't feel the assassin vibe with Adwal, he has a canon on his back practically. 

Chronicles is nothing like the rest of the games, I'd suggest you to watch gameplays and decide it by yourself, I wouldn't recommend it though. (Edit: even though it has great art, not my cup of tea) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see Elizabeth as a double agent, she could maybe be a triple agent, hardly, she loves Russia too much to give up on her, even if Russia tried to kill them. Now Philip, he'd trade Russia for a Big Mac.

I believe cancer-daughter will tell Pastor Tim about them leaving the country because she's a cunt and we can't trust her, as usual, so Tim and Alice will approach Philip and Elizabeth so they don't fly to Russia, Philip will be like "fuck it" kill those two pricks, they be going to Russia anyway, but actually Stan will be nearby, maybe he'll hear or see anything and he'll finally learn about.

	<TEXT> Let's be honest and say that people that are attracted to MILFs have a specific taste. If you stop to think about it Fergie, Ciara, Kim Kardashian are real MILFs, but so does Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin and Rosie O'Donnell; you're not attracted to MILFs, you are attracted to hot MILFs, just as those that say they are attracted to nerdy, redheads or tall women, if they are not hot, those men won't feel as into those females. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't forget the reason why they brought Nel along with them, and whatever happened to Grimmjow

Edit: Also maybe I wasn't paying attentio but whatever happened to Mashiro? And is the 8th captain Lisa?

~~Edit 2: What about that armour that Yoruichi's brother took with him, was I not paying attention again?~~

Edit3: I believe the purpose for the tickets was, as explained by him, as a pass to come and go from SS **if** Ichigo was strong enough that he couldn't go back to his usual world, but Kyoraku also said the chance of this happening was minimal

Edit 4: Komamura is a dog now, not a werewolf anymore. Lille died the same way Gerard did, Kiba only slowed him a bit.

Edit 5: So Ganju was there for what? Tsukishima was half useful but what about the others fullbringers? Also, what about a panel of Yoruichi waking up naked pissed as ball with Urahara for using that drug, which she hates, oh ner? Talking about this muse, whatever 

Edit 6: there are two other noble families, besides Shihoin and Kuchiki, that wasn't mentioned. Also why the Shiba family is a noble family anymore? </TEXT>
