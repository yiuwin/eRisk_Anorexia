	<TEXT> The spectrum is typically limited to democratic developed countries because they're comparable.  At that comparison, the US is probably the farthest right on the spectrum, if not close.  Sometimes it's defined by OECD countries in specific, in which the US is still one of the farthest right countries (but OECD includes a couple countries that aren't particuarly comparable, like Mexico and Turkey).  By Gini for example, the US is the [third highest](http://www.oecd.org/social/income-distribution-database.htm) out of 36 countries.  Only countries higher are Chile and Mexico (not a perfect measure of how left vs right wing a country is by any means though).

It depends on how you define big government.  The American definition of "big government" would be a moderate size government at best by almost any comparable standard.  Europe and Canada even are simply on a different scale.  By European standards, both parties want very small governments in America.  I personally think the US should have at least one European-style option for a party, but currently they do not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think this shows anything about his concern being empty.  There is absolutely nothing to see here in my opinion.

I think there is a big difference between MPs sexually harassing female MPs  (where he did take action) and an inconsiderate joke made in private.  The MP probably didn't even think this through, it was an side comment he thought would get some laughs.

There has to be a line where the party leader is not cracking the whip at every whim.  Save reprimands for serious incidents that warrant serious action.  He isn't reinforcing his point just by punishing a stupid joke.

I really think the only people with any interest in this are people that were already looking for a reason to criticize Trudeau.  There are plenty of legitimate reasons to critisize Trudeau.  This is not one of them unless. </TEXT>

It was a little inconsiderate, but holy shit do people love to take things way out of proportion.  Have we all gotten so touchy that one ill considered joke is now a full blown controversy?

He should say "Sorry, it was a joke in poor taste" to her.  That's it.  No need to reprimand him.  No need to make a huge deal out of this.  Literally not even worth the journalists time to write this article. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really?  Europe reduced by about 26% and counting.  Thats pretty significant.

And I guess your right.  If we wanted, we could sit back and let everyone else do the hard work (including China, that is entering a cap and trade program to reduce their emissions).  We could make about a 2% difference, which isn't nothing.

(Except for local pollution, which will continue to cost our healthcare systems billions every year.)

But thats the thing about climate change.  Everyone has to be on board.  If everyone did what you're saying except China and India, the world would be doomed.  

And you may not have noticed, but China's emissions [may already be peaking](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/world/asia/china-climate-change-peak-carbon-emissions.html) because they did something.  If China can do something, why can't we? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're wrong on a few counts.  

No, the Liberals did not promise it would pay for their social programs.  Trudeau said the money would be returned to the province it came from, it was the provincial governments choice to spend the money or return it in tax breaks.  The money was never the federal governments to begin with.

And Chong's idea is quite well tested worldwide.  Tax cuts lessen as tax revenues drop, naturally.  Or, the tax rises further.  He plans a rising revenue-neutral carbon tax to account for less emissions.

Even within Canada, it is very well established academically carbon taxes do [reduce emissions](http://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2014/07/british-columbias-carbon-tax).  I don't see any reason to be skeptical of that anymore.

It's also taxing all emitting activities, so I guess I don't see the morality issue.  It's no more immoral than regulating energy production, which has the same consequences, if not worse.  So basically, you're left with "If you try to do anything to combat climate change, it's immoral because it may adveresely impact some areas" (although it also benefits others) because if you're opposed to regulatory and market-based solutions, there is nothing left. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not neccesarily a fan of the NDP (Actually voted WildRose last election), but if you're going to force me to choose between Kenney...I'll find an alternative.  

Where?  Great question.  NDP or Liberals are my only options (and Liberals aren't even really a serious option here).  So basically you leave me with the NDP.  The thing is, I don't *want* to vote for them.  But until a serious party can make the case for the center, I'm not left with much choice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure. Exactly.  Downsize your military, we'll fend for ourselves.  That's what we've been saying.  We have never been, and will not be begging for help anytime soon.  Worry about your own god damned business and stop bullying other countries.

You do not require a budget the size of the next 7 countries combined imo to provide stability.  But hey, your business.  But stop pretending all other countries have to spend as much as you *feel* you need to, and stop infringing on the sovereignty of other democratic countries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Plenty of countries have all of that without spending exorbulant amounts on military.  

I'm not against a big military.  Go ahead and spend as much as you want on military if you believe that your military needs to be this big to get all these things.  But as a Canadian, I do not want my government to spend more on military.  So go ahead and spend all you want if you believe its beneficial, but don't pretend the rest of the world owes you something.  And if you believe you can bully sovereign countries into spending more, well...good luck. </TEXT>

They spend that much by choice, no one forced you to.  So stop acting like Germany and the rest of the world owes you a massive debt.  If you don't like it, downsize your military, stop trying to bully other countries into doing what you want. </TEXT>

And I'm not competing directly, its through a local program that pays higher rates, that's the only reason its viable.

	<TITLE> Best Way To Finance My Solar Farm Project? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-19 17:53:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm looking for some advice!

I have an opportunity to start a small solar farm.  To build this will take $250,000 to $275,000 CAD (still working out the final details, but I think I can do it for $250k).

So my own money can contribute $30,000 about.  That still leaves me very short.  So I'm going to need to fund the rest of this somehow.

So here is the situation:

-My credit is good, but I'm also only 20 so it's limited.  
-Being a solar farm, it is one of the safer businesses out there.  Power Purchase Agreement is already in place before construction breaks, so that's not an issue.  Of course it's not risk-free, but it's a lot more certain than many new businesses.

In a way, I almost think it's like a rental property business.  Relatively stable cash flow, and there is an asset at the core.  Sadly, they probably won't be giving me a mortgage for a solar farm.

Ideally, I would like a line of credit secured by the solar farm.  This would allow me to pay off more in the summer when it's producing more and less in the winter.  However, I'm aware this probably isn't a possibility.  If anyone has experience here, would a line of credit be possible at all? 

So what are my options?  I know private investors are a possibility, but do I have any other options?

Any and all advice is appreciated :)

TL;DR: Building a solar farm.  How should I fund this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, but we're just being realistic by admitting he's not going to be the 35 MPG top tier defender we thought we bought, and we shouldn't try to push him into that role.  Some games it feels like he played 25 totally empty minutes just because of his contract.

Yes, we're all going to hate that contract with a passion as long as its in existence.  But as far as Carroll as a player goes, we have to live with the reality of the player we have, not the player we thought we signed two years ago. </TEXT>
