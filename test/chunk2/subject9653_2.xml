	<TITLE> Magic Beer </TITLE>

	<TEXT> A pretty blonde walks into a bar and asks the handsome fellow at the bar what hes drinking.

He says, Magic beer. You want one?
Aw, thats stupid. Theres no such thing she says.
Look, Ill show you. He takes a big swig and proceeds to throw himself out of a nearby window, where he proceeds to fly up and around the building, and back into bar window.

Thats incredible! I dont believe it! she says.
Hey barkeep, throw me another one o them Magic Beers. The bartender shakes his head and pours another beer and slides it down the bar. The man chugs about half of it and proceeds to leap out the window and circle the building again.
Here, you try it he says to the blonde.

She takes a big draw on the glass, jumps out of the window, and falls about 30 feet to the ground  breaking both her legs  and begins screaming in pain.

The bartender says, Superman, youre a real ba*tard when youre drunk. </TEXT>
