	<TEXT>  My great grandfather fought in ww2 and he died in 1986 unfrotunately, but I havent known him because I was born like 15 yrs after he died, but my mom said about him a lot of good things, and she said that my great grandfather was very kind with others. When he ( ggf ) got high fever, he started to tell about the war, like how the russians treated him and stuff like that. He was a prisoner in a camp named Celabinski or something like that in Russia and he said that he survived after he drunk water of the dead bodies and he came with a train for animals. P.S: His brother died when he was 18 yrs old in Russia or Ukraine.  </TEXT>
