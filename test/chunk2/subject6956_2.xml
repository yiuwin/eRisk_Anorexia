	<TEXT> I ride horses so I'm almost always in tight breeches. I just try to buy mid/high waist ones because I hate my stomach and hips. My riding tops are usually relatively loose fitting polo shirts but I tuck them in and wear a belt. As far as non horse riding clothing goes, I always wear skinny jeans. Again, high waisted ones only since I hate my stomach and hips. I tend to wear looser tops as well, but not too lose because then it makes my stomach and upper body look bigger than it actually is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I trawl through here on my main account occasionally to see what tips I can pick up

I'm gonna stop you right there. Tips to pick up a mental illness? 

Okay JK I'm not going to stop you cos this is getting too good. 

The scale is a terrible way to keep track of your journey

Yeah eating disorders aren't a journey. They're a mental illness. A journey has an ending point but for most people with eating disorders, there is no ending point. There is no stopping it. 

You need to treat yourself

Yeah buddy, that's not how eating disorders work. Even if I *wanted* to treat myself, the ED voice in my head won't let me. Last night I was tempted to order pizza. I then proceeded to cry about pizza and how it'll make me fat. Didn't order the pizza. 

I don't know what your logic was in posting this here, but try /r/loseit instead. Eating disorders are not a choice nor are they a lazy diet/quick fix for losing weight. For some people on this sub they may be but you're just invalidating majority of us who have spent days, weeks, months, years being sad and lonely, isolating ourselves from our friends and families, just to avoid food.  </TEXT>

It does have 3g of carbs however I only need 1 packet of Truvia to sweeten up my coffee. Also I use this sugar free French vanilla creamer that's 15 cal per tablespoon and I find that 1 tablespoon is good enough, making my cup of coffee only 15 cal.  </TEXT>

Literally me this morning. I fasted yesterday and usually after 24+ hours of fasting I like to eat soft foods like yoghurt or soup or drink some calories like a protein shake. But I knew I needed to get my blood sugar up or I'd pass out. I settled for a 100 cal granola bar. </TEXT>

I fasted yesterday (just had a few cups of coffee and water) and this morning I felt horrible. Like I got hit by a bus. It was hard to think, stand and walk straight. People say they have energy and mental clarity when they fast and I'm like....??? I know the symptoms would stop if I ate properly but noooope. ED brain won't let me. Bleh. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Small Victory: 14 days of continuous restricting </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-04 18:30:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yesterday was my 14th day of not eating above my calorie limit. I think one day I hit 700 but I was really physically active that day so my net was around 300-400. Restricting and even fasting has become so easy. I still don't think I can fast for more than 36 hours considering how active I am 4 out of 7 days a week, but still. 

In February through mid March I was trying to lose weight the healthy way by eating anywhere between 1000 and 1400 calories a day and I hated it. I constantly had cravings and was overall miserable. But now that I'm back to acting like my stupid 14 year old anorexic self, I feel so much better. I don't know why it's so much easier to eat less. 

The only cravings I had were yesterday and I actually fasted yesterday. I craved Chipotle in the afternoon because I was hanging out with some people who were eating it. Later on I craved pizza and was *so* close to ordering delivery but I made a cup of coffee and the craving went away. 

Anyways, just wanted to share my victory with you guys! Even when I was anorexic as a teenager and made it to my lowest wight (92) I don't think I ever had 14 continuous days of staying at/under my calorie limit. On Wednesday it'll be 17 continuous days and that'll end my streak as my mom and her boyfriend are visiting. I'll probably be eating 1000 calories a day while they're here. She'll be cooking a lot so I can't really track how many calories are in the food aside from the gross underestimation she gives me. 1000 is not horrible, but definitely not as good as 500. 

Shout out to all y'all on this sub. And coffee. You the real MVP.  </TEXT>

And I mean I know the cause of his bucking. My horse's legs have been getting super puffy after jumping so the vet said no jumping for a week/light hacks + Previcox for 14 days. The weather has been funky lately as well, and yesterday was his first day back jumping. So he just got super excited from the jump and it happened. I had a talk with my trainer today and she said not to worry, I did everything right and nothing could have prevented it (besides a lunge, and she took accountability for not having him lunged before my lesson).  </TEXT>

But people who know me that even though weighing 103 isn't underweight for my height, it's one of my lowest ED weights. When I was 18 I was put back into treatment when my weight was fluctuating between 98 and 102. Anyways. She is right. I'm fat and disgusting and have so much weight to lose but her attitude towards me was awful and gah I just feel like she was judging me for being so fat. Again, I'm a hypocrite.

And that I strict to a specific amount of calories + weigh/measure all my food.

	<TEXT> Firstly, my horse bucked me off really badly. I'm sore and my neck is killing me. I have a competition next weekend and I'm just so embarrassed about today. I feel like I have no business riding in the first place. 

Secondly, I met with a nutritionist at my gym. One of the first things she asked me was "is this the highest weight you've ever been?" I couldn't believe it. I weigh 121 pounds. I'm a size 2/4. I'm not the skinniest but I'm not overweight, and this is *one* of my *lowest* adult weights (lowest adult weight was 111, lowest weight ever was 92, usually I rest comfortably between 118 and 122 but I refuse to be that heavy). 

She told me I need to lose 18 pounds of fat. I was already planning on getting back to 92 by the summer. But gah. Just hearing it from someone else makes it even worse. The worst part is I told her I "used" to be anorexic, and she still proudly told me to lose 18 pounds of fat. I guess I'm just a big **fat** hypocrite. I'm okay judging myself harshly but when someone else does it, I'm a big **fat** baby.

I guess I'm fatter than I thought I was. I feel so disgusting and ugly. I haven't been able to stop crying for the past hour and I have no one to talk to about this so here I am. I wish I could take a knife and chop off all my fat. I hate myself. I'm nothing and nobody.  </TEXT>

I saw this post, didn't know how to reply, then thought of a response while I was in the shower. Mistaking a teacher for a friend has still given me a fucked up perspective of teachers/professors.

	<TEXT> Okay a few things: 

1) Are you under 18? Do you live in the US? If you are under 18 (and in the US at least) then a teacher is absolutely obligated to express concerns they have about a student with their parents/principle/etc. especially if the student appears to be causing harm to themselves. 

2) Your teacher is not your friend. You may have some sort of friendly tendencies towards each other but he will always be your teacher first, "friend" (I use this term loosely) second. If he ever oversteps his boundary and becomes your friend, then he has absolutely no business being a teacher. 

3) Now that all of that is out of the way, is there any way you can avoid meal times around him? He can't speak to your parents/principle and say he thinks you have an eating problem when he doesn't see you at times where you're meant to eat. You may not be able to maintain your "friendship" but at least you won't risk being outted regarding your eating disorder.

I am sorry if I come across as harsh or condescending. But when I was 14 years old I had a teacher who I thought was a friend. I told her about my eating issues and she told my parents and headmaster, which caused a myriad of problems for me. Because of this, I have been very distrusting of teachers. I'm in college now and I still don't trust any of my professors, out of fear that if I bring up anything non-school related with them, I'll be demonized. 

To be honest, teachers do not like having *too* close relationships with students because if they have to address an issue with the student's parent/school superiors, they know it removes the trust between the teacher and student. While teachers cannot be friends to their students, there is an amount of trust that teachers hope their students have with them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disclaimer: this was unintentional so, yeah. 

When I was 14, I was put on a medication called Lamictal which *really* suppressed my appetite. I would eat a granola bar at school and come home and have a few bites of dinner. I wasn't hungry enough to eat anything beyond that in a given day. I ended up losing 6 pounds per week because of that. This all essentially prompted me to develop anorexia, but that's a story for a different day.

In general, restricting to 350-650 calories a day is what helps me the most. Anything lower than 350 makes me hungry and gives me cravings. Anything over that, I feel like I'm eating too much and won't lose weight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I enjoy losing weight but I hate my ED. However I am happier losing weight via restricting low cal and fasting than I was restricting to 1000-1400 calories. 

But overall, I really do hate having an eating disorder. I hate that I lie to my friends and tell them I'm busy and can't hang out, when in reality I just want to avoid food. I miss my friends so damn much but my ED won't allow me to see them because there's food involved. 

I hate that I'm slightly annoyed that my mom and her boyfriend are coming to see me show my horse next week, because it means I can't get away with eating as little. I love my mom, I haven't seen her since Christmas and I'm *so* happy she's coming to see me ride for the first time. But my ED brain tells me her visit is a complete inconvenience. 

I'm lonely and single and I *want* to date but I don't allow myself to date because dates involve food and alcohol 90% of the time. I have so much love to give but I'm sabotaging myself by not allowing myself to give that love to someone. Because of fucking food. 

I wish I could eat a normal goddamn meal without crying myself to sleep afterwards. I wish I had the rational mind to tell myself "you may weigh 2 pounds more in the morning but it's water weight and you'll get back on track" but I'm too scared of water weight even.

I wish I could be normal but for almost 10 years I've struggled with ED behaviors and I feel absolutely trapped. It's like an abusive relationship.

I hate that I don't even want help, despite *hating* the fact I have an eating disorder. 

:( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really planning on changing much this month. However, April is a very social month for me. My mom and her boyfriend will be visiting on Wednesday to watch me compete in a horse show. The following Thursday, I'll be traveling to Washington DC with my mom because she's getting some award. I'll be back home that Sunday night. 

I'm not having any trouble restricting. I stick to my calorie limits and I don't get any cravings or desire to eat beyond that. My biggest struggle will be trying to get away with eating as little as possible while being social. So wish me luck! Especially since my mom is well aware about my ED past and will get suspicious if I exhibit any ED behaviors. 

I'm 122.2 as of this morning. If I lose at *least* 3 pounds per week from here on, that'll be 12 pounds down by May 1st. So 110 by May 1st. Hopefully I'm able to weigh less that 110, but 110 is a good, realistic goal for me. I also have a wedding to attend on June 11th and I would love to be 100 by then, but we'll see how my athletics, travel and final exams go.

Edit: I think I might try doing more coffee fasts in April. Maybe 1 coffee fast a week. I did one yesterday because I only had 1 class, so maybe on days I don't have class (Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays) I'll try to do one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it's definitely common with restrictive type eating disorders. Everything you've described are symptoms/side effects/results of malnourishment. They're all bad signs, to be honest. Not eating/eating too little **will** make you sick. Of course majority of people on this sub know how dangerous what we do is as well as the consequences of it all. Correct me if I'm wrong, but most of us are simply accustomed to these feelings and understand that as long as we continue restrict/fast, we will feel these things on and off. I mean...you can't expect that starving yourself will make you *healthy* or even maintain any level of good health.

As far as I'm concerned, the only way to stop feeling this way is to be eating normally. But you can try taking a multivitamin to make up for *some* of the nutrients you are lacking. Fish oil will also help with hair growth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it doesn't matter. There's really nothing special about the ABC diet. The numbers are totally random. You could make your own ABC diet if you wanted. In fact I did this years ago. I would roll a dice and the number + 2 zeros was how much I was allowed to eat per day. E.g. if it landed on a 4 I was allowed 400 calories that day. </TEXT>

I have a friend who is an inch or 2 taller than me and ~25 pounds heavier than me/a good 15-20 pounds overweight. She doesn't know I'm engaging in ED behaviors to lose weight - she just thinks I'm eating healthily and working out a lot. She'll say stuff like "What's the point, you're just going to gain it back when you're 35 and have babies." And she'll tag me in stupid memes on Facebook like "If you eat and sleep good, exercise and always drink water, you will die anyway." She claims she's happy with her body, thinks she's hot, etc. That's nice and all, I wish I was comfortable in my own skin. But I think part of her is jealous that we are close in height and I'm much thinner than her, and will continue to get thinner. </TEXT>

I'm kinda like this. I'll tell my therapist how great I'm doing and how great I feel.

	<TEXT> Hiya. I've been consistently restricting since the 21st, eating about 300-550 calories per day. This morning, my weight is exactly the same as it was yesterday morning. Obviously, that's not a very long plateau (maybe you can't even call it a plateau) but it's frustrating and I'd like to see the scale go down tomorrow morning.

In the past, eating maintenance calories (or even like 500 more than I'm used to) has helped break a plateau but I'm absolutely terrified of eating over 500 a day. I know fasting helps but I can't fast today because I'm in school for 7 hours and there's no way fasting will work for me. 

Any ideas?  </TEXT>
