	<TEXT> I'm 18. I started listening to them few years ago. At first I didn't like them at all. I did not get it why would anyone listen to this. Then I let go of my superstitions and just felt the music. For the first time I actually understood them, I just enjoyed it. I let every little bit of their sound go through me. Now, this is my favourite band hands down. I'm grateful to them because they changed the way i think and listen, they change me whole in many ways. I can't wait to hear the new album, I hope it will be a challenging listen. Let's see if tomorrow wil disappoint </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you put it together in order it says:

Little fireworks of joy 
Tying round reels of strings
Just having their fun 
Trying to get your atrention
