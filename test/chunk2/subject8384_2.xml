	<TEXT> also Fortitude is getting amazing reviews!

"Fortitude is Broadchurch with polar bears, True Detective on ice, Fargo with hot sex and Twin Peaks with woolly mammoths. It's scary and baffling and spectacular. But none of that is the most extraordinary thing about the series that starts tonight on ABC1. What's amazing is the cast, and the way a peculiar project devised by a little-known screenwriter was able to pull in the cream of the acting talent of Europe and America." </TEXT>

Here he was in his 60s, and forced to take a role on television for the money. Its just not where he thought he would be at this point in his life.

	<TEXT> Hello there,

after all the positive feedback on here I went out and bought Destiny today! Im almost Level 4 now but I kinda feel lonely, I have seen Twitch Streams where people play in Groups up to three people. How can I join some of those groups? I think it would be more fun to do the missions in group. Do I need PS+ to join a group? Thanks in advance!

EDIT: After getting PS+ how can I join other story mission teams? Is there an NPC in the tower?

Sorry for my bad english. </TEXT>
