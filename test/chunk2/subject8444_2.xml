	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just curious what others think are the most visual striking/playing starship visuals are. I'm fed character in a faction appropriate ship. I'm loving the super cooled impulse engine with their bright white exhaust. What else is fun. The glowy bits with the reman shield is alright and the obelisk shield, I'm not a fan of that texture. What are your thoughts and suggestions.

EDIT: I'm playing on XBOX, for clarification. Sorry for not flairing this, but I figure everything for PC well be on console soon. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I know there are items that you can take to certain systems and give aid allowing you to gain diplomacy ranks. My question is if it is worth it? They are taking up a quite a bit of inventory space, and I have read that it isn't worth the small amount of points they award. I would go deliver them more often, but I can never remember where they are and what they need.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [XBOX] Questions about beams </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-18 00:58:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm currently on lvl 52 tac captain in a cruiser. Starting to think about how to best utilize my ship T5U Avenger to play into the end until a T6 I like comes out. Reading through here and on the stobuild reddit, I think I'm going to mainly rely on beams for damage (maybe a torp upfront for the sake of canon) 

I was wondering if the type of beam really matters that much? I have been seeing the AntiProtons seen to be the way to go, but I really like the way Tetryon and Polaron weapons look. 

I know that sticking to one type of beam is best due to consoles, but is there a particular reason why one beam type is hands down better than the rest? 

Also with the smaller arc angles on the dual beam is it worth it to include into my build? This whole thing stems from a budget build I saw using only tetryon beams. </TEXT>
