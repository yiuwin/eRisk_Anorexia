There is no other industry that *wants* to take away your ability to make a living. I get a physical every 6 months. I'm hitting close to 50 now and I'm getting frightened every time about passing. Surgeons don't even face this type of scrutiny. No one really does except truck drivers and pilots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely.  I had a Jura Capresso 111 I picked up at a garage sale for $10. It was brand new in the box. I was really considering throwing some super money at a Pasquini  and so glad that I didn't.  I learned so much dealing with the nuances of that machine.  I got really good pulling some descent shots. After a year, it was time for an upgrade.
