	<TEXT> Individual issues are hard to come by and expensive. Amazon doesn't have single issues. If you're in the US I highly recommend buying the paperback volumes from Amazon, who sell them cheapest.

If you're outside the US, the cheapest place to get them is http://www.bookdepository.com/ which has them from around $12-14 US, which is cheap considering they retail here in AUS for around $20. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For anyone who is a fan of the comics and would like some posters, I highly recommend going to ebay and searching for "walking dead cover posters".

A user called baskpop1270 can print most of the covers up to around 100, and he provides them at a relatively cheap price for what they are and in all different sizes, ranging from A4 to A1. He prints on canvas 350gsm, matte photo 180gsm and satin photo 190gsm and in some cases even offers just the artwork with the "The Walking Dead" logo etc. over the top. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi r/needadvice! I've got a question that I want to know if anyone can answer.
I've recently suffered from an RSI injury in pretty much all the dominant muscles in both of my forearms. I developed it from bad piano playing technique, as well as computer use with the mouse and typing. It got really bad, like TERRIBLE, to the point where one click of the mouse would bring a world of pain to my arms. The injury has hit me pretty hard over the last 10 months, and took a big toll on my mental health and wellbeing, as it's always there. When it was bad, anything I did with my arms cause some pain, whether it be really bad or but a little bit. But now I'm on the road to recovery, I'm relearning my technique on piano and I'm using the mouse a lot better than I use to be (sitting up straight, making sure everything is ergonomical etc.) however ther is but one problem stopping me with getting rid of the condition.
I've developed a psychological connection with the piano and the computer meaning 2 things: pain and tension. Now when I go to start either activity, my hands automatically get SUPER tense, but I don't even realise I'm doing it. I only recently realised this when someone pointed it out to me.
If I could get rid of this association with pain and injury that makes the automatic tension, then I would be doing a lot better, as the tension just makes the injury worse - it's part of the reason you get it and part of the symptoms as well.
How can I go about to sever the associations and connections my mind has made? Has anyone been through a similar experience?
Any help would be MUCH appreciated. </TEXT>
