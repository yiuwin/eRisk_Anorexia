	<TEXT> I would like to bookmark every single serie on kissanime in different categories for a project, but since KissAnime is constantly adding new series, how do I keep track of those? Can I see all those that I have not bookmarked yet anywhere ? Or getting an notification/rss feed/e-mail when a new serie is added ?

Kindest regards for helping me in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! I'm new to the community and game just had a few demo's but I'm quite excited to get started. It's hard to decide on a crew to start with since so many look awesomely horrific!

What about the Ashes   Dust box (Outcasts) ? What are my options for crew/awesome combinations ? Thanks in advance!
