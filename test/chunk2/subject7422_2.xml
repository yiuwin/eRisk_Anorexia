	<TEXT> I was born in 87, I got to experience a somewhat decent childhood before shit hit the fan with too much tech. But what I was really referring too was being young in the 50's and 60's, that would have been kid heaven! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast the other day, and Duncan was interviewing Dr. Drew. They got on the the topic of Ibogaine and its healing potentials and Dr. Drew saying how great it was if you can handle it, but it also has its downsides: 1) it can kill you 2) there is a chance that the person will relapse in about 6 months after the trip. So according to him it's not as sure fire as some like to think it is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 27 and struggling as well, I've had relationships but nothing solid at all. Don't know if you're into podcast, but there's a good one called "The Mating Grounds" hosted by Ticker Max (I hope they serve beer in hell) and Dr. Geoffrey Miller. Tucker's a conceited loud mouth but he owns it and Dr. Miller is intelligent and factual with everything he says, it's a good mix. It's helped me out a lot,  you should check it out. Also there's another one called "The Art of Charm" hosted by Jordan Harbinger. I've listened to it a few times it's good and he knows what he's taking about, just comes from a different perspective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's great, I hope it happens! Georgia needs something like this to get this state back up. We have the highest unemployment rate in the country, a new and exciting industry like this would do wonders for us. </TEXT>
