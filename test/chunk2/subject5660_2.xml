	<TEXT> Look if Trump was a snowflake he wouldn't go and debate with Hillary or the other GOP candidates face to face. That's essentially an antithesis of special snowflake. 

So starting a war with the media is just not equivalent to some millennial wanting special safe space because they heard that somebody in the college might imply there aren't 912931 genders.


EDIT: Besides US is not the only country in the world, and other countries their leaders sometimes face opposition from the big media, its really not that odd. Americans are getting to learn lots of new things since the election. Like the Russia/S.Arabia thing, it feels so magnificently ironic to see how they react when another country is influencing their elections.

Jeez, like, have you ever talked to someone in your real life? Do you fact check every thing you say when you're having a friendly conversation? Do you make sure your jokes stand up to 100% science?

	<TEXT>  I'm american. I can tell you how we'd react. 
Nope, sorry that doesn't make you any way expert on the matter. First and biggest issue I take with that is that an "American" is a very loose term, I find it hard to believe Californians would behave the same as people from Texas in case of a foreign invasion. 

 The most powerful military was the british, french and soviets in ww2... 

I meant, that roughly every 50 something years, Russia has been invaded by the most powerful military in Europe/World AT THE TIME. That's not something to scoff at, it created a strong patriotic culture, where it was expected to give blood and guts for your Motherland. Even if it means burning down everything you know so the enemy won't get it. 

Personally I think, the southern states would fight to the last, and the East coast would give some descent opposition, but the rest, I'm not so sure.  </TEXT>

Fortunately one thing my school  did right is educate about the suffering of all people in WW2 and the ridiculous amount of casualties in USSR, Poland and Yugoslavia, and how they overcame probably the greatest evil in human history. I mean the battles and the viciousness in the Eastern front... 

Yes we did learn how fucked up USSR was too, but its ideology wasn't "evil" just the men on top.  </TEXT>

I am not saying the second one is ok, but its a symptom of a complex problem, that should be fixable. I mean, I can't force myself to hate someone that kills protected animals or buys poached meat to feed their loved ones.  </TEXT>

What I think is that the influences are many and different, so its a really complex picture. 

- Oh, I forgot. When I was a kid, every summer we had this black kid coming from Germany, whenever somebody meet him for the first time, they were a bit "enchanted?" by his skin and hair, but as time moved on, he was the "German kid". Like we treated him as a foreigner from Germany, because he spoke with a German accent and talked to us about Germany.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-19 20:31:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been playing for a few days  this game, and I've noticed a lot time there is lots of kills by a few lmgs over 100m. They usually hide somewhere and just shred people.

But actually they do not shred, its more like a sting. I never see any muzzle flash, I barely, just barely hear some burst fire and I'm dead or a teammate of mine. 


So far the only thing that seems to deal with them are tanks and smoke grenades. I just have no idea what to do when up against them and maybe I don't know WW2 weapons that well, but I just don't understand why is an LMG this quiet and stealthy over 50-100m. Dozens of players get killed by it (several times) without even being able to guess where its shooting from I think one big fear about this game I had came true, its too goddamn niche. 

You either have these super vets that have over 1k visits to the server, or poor newbies like me that barely started. Then I suppose the recruits get discouraged by crazy high level of skill (seriously the accuracy and reflexes are insane), leave the game and then you have such small even more niche community. 

Because, I'm not sure how many times more I will "have fun" by getting killed from 150 meters by a freakin' smg or the instance the pixel of my body reveals itself. 

So far I really hope I got the wrong servers, but its getting harder and harder to rely on that.

P.S. What I would really like to see is a post-battle killcam of all the times I've got killed or something like that, I really want to know how the hell I get killed sometimes. 

EDIT: After playing some more, I've gotta say I got even more frustrated. I got killed by automated weapons from huge distances, and it seems the second I peak or even flank one of the players, they get instantly turn and kill me. One player raked up over 70 kills with an lmg, and I saw him ONCE, like I actually saw him once shoot. 

I think smgs are starting to piss me off even more, since they seem to have no drawbacks, I get starched by them with ease both close quarters and long distance. How is that supposed to be realistic and immersive? When a player can insta kill me with an MP40 over 50m? That tops even the smart guns in Alien movies games. I'm starting to think that weapons are way toooo accurate. 

**EDIT 2** : 

I have to applaud this subreddit, hands down one of the best I ever I had the pleasure of communicating. 

So with the advises of people here I got better to a degree (cake slice was very useful and intuitive). But please understand, maybe my post came of as criticism of the game but now I am definitely sure the game is not that much of a problem. Its just the number of players. When I play on the server, I often see players joining that at least had a 100 visits to this server. A lot of them are over 1k. So that is a bit brutal and unfair. I just feel like if I had more games with in which the player base is mostly beginners,  they would be more fun. I think that is the recipe for fun in most of multiplayer games, I myself on a lot of MP(not just FPS) games always disliked playing against players way bellow me or way above me, it is usually near my skill level that gets the most entertaining results. I mean it would be also kinda hilarious seeing two squads facing each other, have no goddamn idea what to do and their veteran leaders constantly face palming!

This of course is not something the developers can't fix, at least not easily and directly, I am just afraid, because this is usually a sign of a dying community, so I hope the new Vietnam game will revitalize the franchise.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Can you imagine an expedition from the Old Kingdom or a Mesopotamian  civilization through the Danube. I think that if that really happened and was somehow recorded for us to read today, it must have been the most epic clash of worlds ever recorded. I am not an expert by any means on the period, but I am pretty sure that the differences would be immense. For the Egyptians it would have probably felt like visiting some ancient wild world full of danger and mystery. I doubt bronze would have been wide spreed then in central Europe. I would venture so far as to suggest it might as well have been a late stone age. 

Anyway, I would pay a ticket to watch that movie or movie/documentary. You don't need fantasy really, when you human history at times can be even more bizarre. 

Just imagine an Egyptian trying to explain what an Pyramid is to some of the "natives", or Egyptians seeing the wild forests full of unbelievable beasts or feeling the cold of Europe. Anyway, if somebody is knowledgeable on the subject, why not offer some other potential interesting reactions or thoughts if this happened.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-10 00:19:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Maybe its not the fans, maybe its the outside media and occasional viewers, but God almighty I remember being so frustrated with the constant whining, complaining and nagging at GoT writers or directors. I thought that by the end of season 3(1) we established two things about the show :

- Your FAV character is not safe.

- Brutal and gruesome things are gonna happen.

For me the final straw was, some movie/comic/tvshow critics praising season 6 as the BEST season. Okay, I can live with that, but when they started explaining why they liked it, it was basically : "YAAAY FOR THE GOOD GUYS AND NICE STUFF IS HAPPENING". 

GoT is not Star Wars, haven't you got the memo by now? 

Second thing that got me off the rails, is death of one major character after season 3. For crying out loud, how can you still be shocked with this? How??? Have you missed all the tabloid and media shit storms about every death previously and how they were unexpected and how "fans" reacted?

What is the reason you are watching GoT? Twist deaths and brutal scenes are part of its shtick, like new spells in Harry Poter or new tech in Iron Man, just think for one second and you don't have to overact every time it happens, because when you do I think people should question your intelligence. These are not some intricate plots hidden in the subtext, it is what everybody is talking about, because its a climax and a trend in the sowh. Honestly for all the praise GoT gets,  a  lot of its viewer base reminds me on the soap operas and teen-vampire shit. "OOH THEY HOOKED UP AGAIN, OOOH NOH THEY KISSED, OOOH THEY ARE BREAKING UP AGAIN' week after week. 

Why this worries me, is that these backlashes discourage GoT and other TV shows from doing their thing. A good outside example would be whining about the "torture porn" in the latest Walking Dead season, Jesus Christ I adamantly hate torture porn, yet I thought that the violence was kind of meh, not that gruesome really. 

Again, I think the main problem comes from people watching too much tame media, they hear the hype, they come to see this piece of art, then they complain how it doesn't adhere to their special standards of entertainment.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Probably one of the most majestic creatures that live on the Earth, and one of the largest species. You would think they would be worshiped before elephants, lions, bears or cows. I guess there were some cultures around the Polar belt that deified whales.

My guess for why weren't they worshiped is probably technology or lack there off. By the time humans could travel the Ocean in mass, the monotheistic religions had a firm grip, and I don't think that humans were able to hear whale songs until recently. Another reason is that, how many individuals could have seen a whale under water swimming? Hardly much.

Its just interesting for me, I guess I asked this out of mild desperation, but whales do seem to me a like huge missed opportunity of culture. If I as a primitive hunter gatherer or even Bronze age individual had some kind of knowledge of their size, movement, songs and virtual lack of predators (other than you know killer whales who are technically dolphins but still). My guess that sure as hell they would be my gods, if my culture attributed animals to Gods. Can you just imagine sailors of some ancient seafaring culture, seeing a sperm whale killing a collosal squid? What do you think the impact would have been? I would put my money on a "protector god killing the demon or devil". Of course those battles take places deep bellow the ocean so...

With that, I can't stop thinking but what awesome myths, legends or feats of art we missed. Like sculptures, statues, architectural feats, maybe even music inspired by whale songs or various forms of imagery.

God damn you technology nature for screwing us over like this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to read Conan stories and I am even 100% sure that I'm gonna read some books, so I don't think I am breaking the sub-reddit's rules. I'm not giving some vague description and asking for a book based on it, I just need a bit clarification and even discussion. It might help somebody else down the line.

Reading Conan books  might be messy experience if I do not ask for advice from somebody who did it already. I basically want to follow a clear chronological order and one clear continuity or canon. It would really be a bummer if I read some short story or even a novel that doesn't have much to do with the Conan mythos. 

I also wonder should I try to find some comics, since if they have identical story and lines to the books but amazing art, I could try them out. I understand this is a books subreddit, but the comic books subreddit could also delete my post because its about books. So what am I supposed to do then? I figured since Conan is original a pulp character,a book subreddit is a better place. 


P.S. What is the point of so many sub-reddits about books? There is even a /r/BookDiscussion, I thought this one is about book discussions?

Of course an SSD will make all this faster, but if the storage is the issue shouldn't then the loading time be consistent and not random? And besides I played with players who have r6 on SSD and they too experience long loading times, from time to time. Sometimes I load before they do!

As matter of fact, sometimes I just turn of all my browsers, and its almost as R6 loads faster, I am not so sure of this but it seems always like a safe bet. Keep in mind I am doing "nothing" on this browsers, I am not playing, uploading, downloading, its just some pages that are opened (Facebook, reddit, etc...) I have also speculated with some players, that just alt-tabing makes the load time longer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a very popular diet in former Yugoslavian countries, in short it goes like this:

- First day - Protein day
- Second day - Starch day
- Third day - Carbohydrate day
- Fourth day - Fruits day 

After the cycle of 74 days, or 29 days (three times during the diet) you will need to have a water day.

For more [detail](http://www.healthylifevision.com/un-diet-this-diet-lasts-for-90-days-and-you-will-lose-18-25-kilos/) .

Anyway, I really can't find much mention of it on English, and much less criticism. I have found only one non-english criticism by a nutritionist, which was kinda pointed out all the obvious flaws of it. For some reason, I get the name Meghan Telpner, when I search undiet, however that name (or any) is never mentioned on non-english sites. So I am a little confused there.

I mean, how are you supposed to be healthy and lose weight in healthy way, if you aren't supposed to have diverse meals every day. How are you supposed to have a healthy diet  if you have a designated day for CARBS, CANDY and SWEETS!!! Then there are days where you are supposed to just drink water, what in the... 

I am not a professional nutritionist, but to me this seems like a very dangerous diet for very desperate people, because it does work in the sense that you lose weight 15-20kg, but the price seems to be your health if you stick to it any longer.  The diet also promises to "fasten your metabolism", that's just... ugh... 

For some reason

	<TITLE> If GotG2 does not end up being the first MCU non-Iron Man movie to hit the 1B, what other MCU title will be the most likely to do it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-25 17:18:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think there is a solid possibility of Iron Man being in the 1bil exclusive club for MCU until 2019, or rather when Avengers:IW2 ends. Because quite frankly GotG didn't really make all that much money worldwide when you think about it, I mean it did but it wasn't giant monster smash (it didn't reach 800mil), it also had weak contenders during August and September, of course it did help everyone liked it so it had those crazy legs. 

But this time in weeks after its release it will face Arthur, Pirates of the Caribbean, Alien:Covenant, Baywatch, Wonder Woman, The Mummy, Cars 3, Transformers... None of this movies on their own, are a threat (except a surprise hit, there is always one surprise), but combined I think it will take out a lot of legs, + kids in schools. So it has to have a monster opening which is possible, but three weeks before Fate of the Furious comes out, so it might draw some of the air and fatigue with the audiences, not all of it of curse, but enough to make a dent. So my guess GoTG2 goes 400ish domestic and 900ish worldwide.  FotF will definitely  beat it, I have no doubt about that though. Also maybe 3 years took out of some that momentum, I am 90% sure if it released in 2016 it would have had a bigger opening. I think that, because the movie landscapes are changing QUICKLY, for example now people might associate an "cool 70s, 80s" in an big action blockbuster soundtrack as annoying trend.  

EDIT: There is a way out for GoTG2, maybe it will be the year of summer ALPHA blockbusters, where will get a few *trump voice*HUGE blockbusters but a pile of bodies with a lot of box of bombs. Basically the box office will look like the [DOOM Marine](https://68.media.tumblr.com/35b651c42a1f6de921f0c21d564fa9c3/tumblr_o76xxyIPX41u9werno1_500.gif) past through it.

So let's see other possible MCU contenders, and why I am skeptical anybody will make it without Iron Man.


- Thor: Ragnarok, I don't think it can crack it, maybe if it is like a masterpiece and the Justice League ends being the biggest bomb in history. But I think this one has the closest chance. But really Thor is not a big draw, Chris Hemsworth is not a draw, Hulk is weird but on his own definitely not a draw.

 
- Spiderman: Homecoming has Iron Man so it is disqualified, but for fun sake I am mentioning it. Even with T.S.  I am skeptical it can hit 1bil. In weeks leading up to it you have Transformers and Despicable Me 3 and the week after it War of the Planet of the Apes, and Spiderman has lost all his momentum that I don't think Civil War was enough to fix. 

 
- Cap. Marvel, no fucking way, impossible. Even if it released in the week after the inauguration and used the women's march momentum, even then impossible.

 
- Black Panther, no fucking way, impossible. I can't spin in it into 1bil, simply not happening.

 
So what do you think? I feel like I missed a tittle  though.

P.S. The summer is too stacked and overcrowded, and why aren't studios trying to take January, September and October with the heavy hitters, how many times do they have to learn the lesson of "hey, no competition, big bucks" that James Cameron thought them in 1997. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have noticed that as time passes by, my knowledge gap between the British and non-British armies increases. In the last episode Indy is sad that that is just the sad reality. 

But, that got me wondering, why is it that hard? I have no idea don't get me wrong, but I am wondering how much would it cost for them to pay for translations? They could probably even get some discounts if some fans did it. Any thoughts on this, because I feel like this is a damn shame to miss out on so much information, and you know what? I find the British least interesting, I already feel over-saturated with the British and the US representation in historical documentaries and other forms media, so it makes the great war less special when I can get the same info easily in other media. TGW felt like a great alternative in many regards, so I hoped that was to be case too, and IT IS to a degree. But there is room for improvement.  

P.S. The episodes with the Turkish uniforms and about the Belgian king Albert were some of the most interesting to me because they opened up new frontiers to me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Were there any "good" US presidents since Lincoln? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-23 19:38:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I ask this because I am constantly befuddled when Americans start to talk about previous presidents. You mention one and somebody will always give arguments how he was absolutely terrible, not bad, but terrible. The last president that nobody really criticizes on a major scale is freakin' Lincoln. After him the game is on, republicans will say every democrat was the worst president ever and vice versa. Its really frustrating, and completely discourages me from that subject. Part of me thinks, these people are incapable of having complex thought and understand that there is a gray area for everything. That life is not red and blue. 

I mention Lincoln because I thought that this only holds true for recent presidents, like of course people are gonna be salty about some of them, but no, it goes even as early to Teddy Roosevelt, so whenever I read or engage an discussion about commanders in chief, I see a huge polarization among people no matter how much time has passed.

Now, the reason I also find this confusing is because isn't the US kicking ass constantly since Woodrow Wilson? Like how could Reagan or Kennedy or Nixon or FDR or Eisenhower or any for that matter be THAT bad? It seems to me that the discussing American history is impossible without politics. Now I personally see a constant downward spiral in geopolitics since the first Bush to Obama, but I would not say all of them "destroyed" America and were absolutely horrible.

So what is in your opinion the last president after Lincoln that knocked it out of the park? In my humble opinion, its got be Woodrow, the man started the process of turning the US into a superpower, which was long overdue. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I yearn for the next "Empire Strikes Back" or "The Dark Knight"... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> We have been promised so many times by Hollywood marketing in last 5ish years that yeah this is the "TESB" or "TDK" of a certain franchise and then got promptly fucked over. 

I've recently  watched some scenes from the Dark Knight and kids reacting to the twist in Empire, and was thinking, damn we really need something like this again, there is way to many fake outs * *cough* * Age of Ultron * *cough* * or business as usual sequels. 

So it would be refreshing to see a sequel that is so out of the ordinary and completely flips the switch, that actually feels dark and actually does have dark moments that make you feel sad or uncomfortable in a way. 


EDIT: I forgot. Terminator 2, kind of fits into this. Its one also one of the best unexpected sequels ever, that changed the game and touched people. 


P.S. Batman V Superman doesn't counts, because too many people didn't like it. I myself liked it a lot, but the death in that movie is a fake out, since we all know what is gonna happen after, it just had no weight.

	<TEXT> - Both are the fourth sequel that revived the long dead franchise.

- Both shocked and outraged at just how GOOD they were, usually these kind of sequels suck hard.

- Both have this hellish red hopeless lifeless aesthetic mixed with rugged machines 

- Both have awesome kick-ass no non-sense soundtrack

- Both have awesome kick-ass no non-sense main character

- Both's protagonists are the not that proactive in the story and are usually guided by other characters

- Both have disgusting fat blobs

- Both have jumpy imp like annoying villain henchmen

- Both have the main villains with machine implants

- Both have an open ending.

Now, I am not deluded but there are many differences too, of course, but the "fourth sequel of this old badass property that is set in a hellish red dystopian future from times long past comes out of nowhere and kicks ass just like its protagonist" was impossible to not mention.  </TEXT>
