	<TEXT> Big Boss has been haunted before, and those ghosts appeared as ghosts might. Spectral, transparent, even hovering. Ol' Skully here appears to be solid, and walking on the ground. Heck, the Volgin "ghost" walking around in the trailers fits the transparency part of my observations. I don't think Mr. Face is a ghost here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Big Boss considered people like Boss and himself to be weapons, so when Boss laid down her patriot, she laid down herself, and betrayed Big Boss silly notion. As if his lifelong idol had just reveled to him that it was all an act. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah. Fuck you. I wish there was a way to fine you potential future Gold.

Gottfried is the star of my dream MCU lineup:

Peter Parker? Gottfried.

Nathaniel Richards? Gottfried.

Norrin Radd? Gottfried.

Mephisto? Gottfried.

Uatu? Gottfried.

Annihilus? Gottfried.

Fin Fang Foom? Gottfried.

Richard Rider? Gottfried.

Carol Danvers? Gottfried.

Beta Ray Bill? Gottfried.

Marc Spector? Gottfried.

Doreen Green? Gottfried.



...and so forth, until the entirety of the MCU is acted, mo-capped, and dubbed the legend himself.

How dare you? </TEXT>

That guys been a dick through the whole series. 

After all Big Boss has put up with, and will continue on doing so long after MGSV, I think It would be great of he got his hand on this fuckers goiter at least for a second, before failing and falling back into Zero's hands.

No? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [REQUEST] Pogna Balogna pictures for pizza. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> That's right, you pizza me, I'll balogna you.

In exchange for three XL triple topping pies from my local Papa Johns, I will endow your lucky petootie with three hand crafted, and tastefully birthed images of the balogna of a pogna (pony), made real by my own hands!

Granted, you will be getting the better end of this deal, but I want pizza that comes at no monitary cost to myself, so... whats a  starving Zambogna operator like myself supposed to do?

This offer is open to any and all takers. I can whip up pogna balogna masterpieces on a whim. All day, all night if necessary. Would be glad to accrue tons of Papa Johns Credit for the far off future.

TL;DR
I draw three pictures of POGNA BALOGNA, you get me three XL three topping pizza from Papa Johns.

	<TEXT> 1, 2, and 3 would all have helped a bit. If Capcom had been developing sooner, and if the CD rom wasn't so effing 'spensive, things would have gone a bit better.

Kieth Courage is the worst pack-in of all time. 

One port? Odd numbered port accessory? Fuck you NEC.

Earlier release would have done a bit to overshadow Genesis, but marketing outside of gaming publications and comic books would have really done wonders for the system. Never once did I see an on-air TG16 related advertisement. Nobody knew what the console was outside of advertised-to gamers. The hype just wasn't there. 

Zero public awareness doomed this console. </TEXT>
