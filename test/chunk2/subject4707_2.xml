	<TEXT> Ah thank you ever so much for the explanation! That was perfect.

So do you recommend the 50/50 build?
(Presuming that is TF/GB/IE/Shiv/Lucid holds then eventually ER after selling boots)

Or would full crit generally be better after the slight lethality nerfs?

Apologies for all the questions! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello GPmains!

I am a relatively new GP player. I have sandboxed the combos a little bit and have played a few normals and I have finally found a champion that I have a blast (no pun intended) to play!

My question:

How is lethality calculated in game and after the LW buff, is it needed?

I ask this because I see that LW now gives 45% armour penetration. The tooltip of our barrels reads 40%, making 85% together.

Since this is a high number, do we really need lethality or can we run the 100% crit build instead?

I may be very wrong with them stacking as it does sound completely broken but I thought I'd ask anyway!

Thank you in advance 3

	<TEXT> I love match days!

All that excitement and prediction of score lines

The anticipation of the starting line up and formation

The strong start showing lots of promise

Ending up as complete disappointment to balance things out.

Still, they'll always have my support! UTV VTID </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Brilliant starting line up. That would be, in my opinion, one of our strongest line ups we could put out.

The team has to start performing together now, so we can finish on a high note. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks bro but currently I have absolutely nothing connected to the PC whatsoever other than the Mobo, CPU and heatsink. It's just either an endless 2 second pre BIOS bootloop or it's a black screen with the fans endlessly running. Can't really be the ram. There's no beeps whatsoever either </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello /r/pcmasterrace.

I have been frustrated for weeks now. My PC I build years ago cost 1500 to make. It's lasted me 3 years without a single issue, till now.

I was stuck in a 3 second bootloop. I would turn the PC on, nothing posted. Didn't get to BIOS, it would literally start the fans, turn off automatically and restart itself endlessly.

I replaced both the PSU and Mobo together, I am still having identical pre BIOS bootloops where nothing happens, I assume my CPU has gone (lol cy@ I7 4970k).

I have bought and sent back several motherboards due to wrong specs in the last few days and the one that fit my CPU was a 1150 socket. As I've put it in my rig and tested it, I can no longer send it back. So I need to ask you all:

Which processor can I use for gaming? I want a decent processor as I'm used to the high end I7 however I only really play games such as World of Warcraft, League of Legends and BF1. I don't want to break the bank on this.

Does anyone know of an all round good performing Intel processor that is compatible with a Gigabyte GA-Z97P-D3 socket 1150 motherboard?

I feel like giving up right now

Thanks in advance if anyone can help me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks bro. I usually double scoop my protein every shake (35g per scoop) so two of them a day and I've hit my protein in take regardless, can then focus on calories then! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not necessarily what's wrong with it in general, but for me. I'm very light for my height so I would assume eating heavily fatty take out foods every day would make me hit calorie surplus quickly but neglect my body in other nutrients it would need.

Just going to stick to carbs for quick release energy, high protein with some fats. I've read a few links some Redditors have kindly sent me and I'm seeing generic trends on how to diet to build up so I have a rough guide. It's all starting with eating more regardless! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the swift reply! It's much appreciated

So because I'm on the very light side I can generally eat "clean" (not binging on high fat meals), keep my calories high with plenty of protein and generally not have to worry? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seen conflicting information about calorie intake.

I'm currently 5"11' and weigh 69kg so I'm very much what most people would call skinny fat. I've got a workout I very much find fun and I do notice slight improvement in the weight I'm lifting, but I just can't put body weight on

I've always been told that calorie surplus is needed for muscle mass gain however I've also been told that eating in surplus will make my gains unnoticeable as I'll put fat on too...how should I be bulking? Thanks ^^ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That diet is everything.

I was drastically underweight due to an eating disorder and struggled to put on the weight due to lack of eating but then wondered where my gains were.

Recently started a high protein/carb diet with high calorie shakes in between in an attempt to bulk and genuinely feel much better.

Although I'd currently be described as "skinny fat" now I've always been told you need to eat in surplus to gain muscle mass so I can always cut after! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello there! 

A little bit of context, I play many sports and hit the gym, I've worn glasses for the majority of my life and contact lenses didn't aid my dry eye whatsoever. I had -4.7 in my right eye, -4.75 in my left with slight astigmatism.

I was consulted by 3 surgeries in the UK to have the surgery done and the last one persuaded me to proceed due to how amazingly comfortable the surgeon made me feel.

Fast forward 4 weeks and I had my procedure and I have to be honest, given the chance to go back and do it again, I would with ZERO hesitation.

My eyesight is now one step better than 20/20, I had very limited side effects and my life has completely changed for the better.

If you PM me I'd be more than happy to go through the procedure, after care and recovery process with you.

Peace! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Currently using "YASH2". It differs from other difficulty modifiers as it actually changes everything rather than randomly buffing/debugging things

Be warned though. It makes it Dark Souls level difficult, it is very, very rewarding though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I decided to play a completely magic only play through and so far I have strictly used only Destruction, Restoration and Illusion.

I have found some mods that drastically change the difficulty of the game on PS4 so I may do stealth archer in the future on a new play through as a much higher difficulty might offset the fact of how OP it is.

I love magic but I am a little let down at how weak magic is as opposed to archery and melee but I think there's mods to help with that too!

The way of the Mage is the only way for me </TEXT>
