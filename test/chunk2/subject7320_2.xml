These are shitty selfies designed to look...I dunno, sexy?  Besides the people who are just going to say '10' because they think it'll get them naked pics in pms, the rest of us are trying to figure out what you look like with out all the paint on and zoomed out a bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Solid 7.  For a reference point, 7.5 is the highest I've given on this sub.  Legitimately attractive and you don't have to resort to confusing angles/zoom in to appear better.  Nothing that needs changing and it's a look that will only get better as you get older.

Only possible thing that would be keeping away people is non-look related, so I would say quit being dick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey that's great.   I think most people have to lie a little.   When I joined they Marine Corps, I had to lie about my broken bone that never healed back correctly in my hand.   Luckily it's not my firing hand.   That being said, it's probably for the best you didn't go to boot camp with asthma.  Extremely unlikely you would have graduated Marine recruit training with it. 

Don't explain yourself so much, some people do just join for the benefits.   You don't owe anyone an explanation.  I joined to get the hell out of my hometown and it looked fun.   

Make sure to get everything you can out of it.   A lot of people go their whole career just collecting a pay check.   Start racking up quals, and anything you can put on a resume.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're probably right about that.  

That's great though, see how it goes.  If Okcupid doesn't work out, I found I had a more quiality selection on match.com but I cost money to use. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah, I get it.  I'm the only one.  I watched the movie at 3 am while on duty so maybe I should give it another shot.  I've never seen so many people stand up for something obscure heh.  I'LL WATCH IT AGAIN, OK?  You can all put the pitch forks down:) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Grats!  Don't forget to be more of a woman and less of a mom if you go on a date.  Keep that seperate until someone is worth showing.  If you want my advice keep the dates public.  

I went out on a number of dates with single moms and it can get weird if they are still in mom mode.  Usually the best sex though....probably could have left out the last part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the way you put that.  I am successfully swayed.


However, I will never stop replaying in my head, the scene where he combat rolls to the ladder.  Don't ask me why (of all scenes) I was done specifically at this moment, but I had had enough.  

(Although the switcharoo shortly after was pretty awesome.) </TEXT>
