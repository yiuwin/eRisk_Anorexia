	<TEXT> If it is, I would love some help. My boyfriend is turning 21 very soon and I have no idea what to get for him... He's doesn't want perfumes, clothes .. I need a nice original idea up to $100. Maybe something I can make, but I've been very uninspired lately with creativity and haven't thought of anything. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My skin used to be very oily and I had some acne. Now,I just started my fourth month of accutane. My skin is just normal right now, but I get flakiness sometimes especially around my nose. 

I'm looking for a foundation with medium coverage, matte but not cakey, that won't accentuate dryness. 

Now my other problem is that I have fair warm toned skin, which makes it hard to find the right color. I'm NC15 in MAC, Bobbi brown warm ivory. Thanks in advance!!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had been almost 7 years when my bf and had a bad feeling about a slutty girl from his work. He reassured me everything is fine. And sure enough,  a few months later he cheated on me with her, we broke up. They moved in together after a few days.

So I say, go with your gut feeling. Its probably not an innocent friendship  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good quality, soft "buttery" shadows (I hate this word, but they're on the creamy side of shadows, I'm sure you know what I mean)
Some fallout with the more shimmery shades
Pigmentation is wonderful. 
Definitely worth the price! I've been so happy with it, and can't wait to get my hands on the 2nd one  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to say that taking accutane is very individual. My only issue is dry lips, sometimes dry nose and eyelids but not all the time. 

I started seeing an improvement by the second week, and by 1.5 I stopped breaking out </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 40mg, 3 months in. Will stay on this dosage for the rest of the course, doing 8 months. I definitely prefer a low dosage and longer course to keep the side effects at bay. Of course heavier people naturally will need to do higher dosages, so keep that in mind. I weigh 60kg </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm the type of person who would rather get up an hour earlier than I technically need so I won't be in a rush, and have a peaceful morning. If I start my day this way, I feel better, refreshed, I'm in a good mood and usually even have more energy. 

Doing my makeup could take 10 minutes for a simple look, but I do work in a makeup counter which means I obviously want to look my best every single day, and makeup plays a huge part, naturally. So if I have the time, I do my makeup slowly and carefully, and I really enjoy this process. It's my relaxing time, and its also like a toy for me. On a day like this I can even take up to an hour. Oh, the perfectionism. 

About the husbands who don't understand, he should be aware of how makeupakes you feel and affects your day. I know some people who wake up early to read the entire newspaper, smoke and drink coffee. Then you have the people who work out in the morning. For us makeup addicts, it's the same thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I carry a concealer in a pencil form like the L'oreal one, or even the click up one with the brush on the top like Maybelline and its really saves me every time. So easy to stick in your purse! I just touch up where I lost the coverage. No need to buy an expensive concealer for this BTW  </TEXT>
