	<TEXT> Best advice. You win. I'll definitely go the route you suggest.

Also concerning the VNs,  I don't mind reading at all, but I just didn't want to sink countless amounts of time finding every last plot point and discovering every single ending possible. According to another post, the game makes it fairly simple by letting you save points during routes. Shouldn't be so bad now. 

Thanks a bunch! I actually look forward to watching 06 TBH since I'm relatively casual, and my list of anime I've seen is awfully standard. :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just that they seem take a while, even for readers like me, to find every bit of plot in every possible outcome. </TEXT>
