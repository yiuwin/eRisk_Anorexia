	<TEXT> Right, I completely agree with you as an earlier comment made me change my mind on the matter. It is imperative that we have both British and Americans realize that no accent is inherently correct. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Teachers. Have the teachers starting saying to the youngsters, "The colours blue and green". And that's it. Just have teachers start teaching British spelling and eventually it will become the norm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, there is no one way. However, differences in spelling can cause confusion among foreign students of English with spellings such as plow and plough. I am not against American spelling. It's simply better to have a standardized way of spelling words in order to keep the language consistent across different countries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wasn't arguing for spelling that reflects pronunciation. Rather, I was arguing that we should teach British spelling in schools as a default so that the language could have a standardized way of spelling. People can speak however they like, grammar and written language however, should be something universal that is set in stone. </TEXT>
