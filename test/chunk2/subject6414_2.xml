	<TEXT> The problem with "everything in moderation" is what "moderation" really means. Strictly speaking, moderation means the middle ground between two opposites, taking ideas from both spectrums. However, this approach does work with everything. Eating shit food in "moderation" generally doesn't work for those trying to eat healthy, lose weight, become superior athletes, etc. There are plenty of examples where "moderation" does not work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my first post, and yes, it's supposed to be funny/stupid. 

Anyway, I can across a clip from the movie Batman Begins that's applicable to NoFap. The key words are "pressure", "water supply", and "gonna blow". This scene is a great example of what happens when your trying to stop yourself in the middle of a session.

A nice poem, but I have one of my own:

My face is red, my balls- are blue. Don't- fap, It's not good for you--.

As you can see, I was inspired by Emily *Dick*inson. Alright, I'm leaving now.

	<TEXT> Let us say a final farewell to this unnamed hero, a hero who was once a brother, a fellow fapstronaut, who stood side by side by us in the war against porn, a war against a degrading and destructive act, a monster as deadly as the Sirens. Let us pay homage to the man who survived 76 hurricanes, each greater than the last, only for his ship to sink upon the 77th hurricane. He fought to keep ship afloat, through biting wind and laughing waves, to no avail. At the bottom of the ocean he lies a hero, an inspiration for us all. His courage will never be forgotten. With these words in our hearts, I, and my NoFap brothers say a final farewell. Rest in Peace, brother, rest in peace. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the temptation never really goes away. You get stronger, and the temptation gets weaker, but make no mistake, the temptation is always there. 

As for activities/hobbies, ultimately you need to decide what you want to do. Cold showers, meditation, physical training, reading are all great things you would benefit from doing. But really, the list is endless. I personally enjoy dog training, archery, Muay Thai, hiking, and philosophy in my free time. Your interests however are yours alone and you need to decide what you enjoy doing and what is beneficial for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the hike treated me like shit lol. I was feeling adventurous and decided to hike through the woods and up a steep hill, all covered in two feet of snow. It was really tiring trudging through the snow. Then I started to get blue balls, which made the trip more painful. 

But even though it kinda sucked, I felt pretty alive during the hike. Definitely felt better than if I decided to stay home and fap. Your post gave me the idea to get out of the house and hike so thank you for that. I managed to kill my urge and keep my streak intact. </TEXT>
