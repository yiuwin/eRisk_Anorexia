Some people put straight vg on there as lube.  
I had a veritas clone top that would not come off so I ended up taking off one of the O rings. 
  
  
If you take off an o ring make sure u have a spare, because if it breaks and it ends up too loose you're screwed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is mother 1, 2, and 3 for the nes, snes, and gba in that order.  
Those are Japanese though, the only official English release we got was Earthbound, which is mother 2. 
  
  
You should start at Earthbound for the Snes, yes the games are linked together but you don't have to beat one to understand the others.
  
  
The easiest way to get Earthbound would probably be to buy it on the wiiU on the eshop or get an emulator on ur pc.

	<TEXT> It does.  

Well it depends how comfortable you are building the RDA itself, [here's a dual coil build that looks pretty good](http://www.steam-engine.org/coil.asp?s=dp r=0.6 hfnw=50 awg=28 id=2.5)

  
dual coil, 6 wraps per coil(2.5mm drill bit) with 28 gauge = about .6ohms  
That ramp time doesn't look too bad @50 watts but if you want better you can try 5 wraps per coil. 
  
  
The Istick will fire at .5 right?   
I only use mech mods so I don't really know the limits for those devices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The atty's the others described are good. What's going to help get you clouds is coil surface area, try to get a good amount of wraps in there but not so much that it will take a long time to heat up(ramp time). Also the air flow is really important, it has to be lined up right with the coil(s). I'd recommend 26-28 gauge if ur max is 50 watts. </TEXT>

Here's something fun to do if you never played it. Watch the intro, the part that looks like a TV with a lot of **red** static, but don't watch the rest after that. Let that image sink in your mind and then start the game.

Project M is competitive, there is going to be a bit of screen lag, dropped frames once in a while, and maybe over heating if your son can't take care of his laptop properly. This is what you get if you buy a cheaper laptop.  
   
Not to mention your son will be ridiculed for bringing a laggy setup if he takes it to a competitive get-together.

Leder says that the humans were eventually the ones to destroy the world. Could it have happened that soon? When Ness hits adulthood? You're gonna have to bridge that gap in ur fanfic.

	<TEXT> Ex freelancer.com graphic artist here. I started there as a beginner doing only logo contest entries for about a year. I tried to withdraw my prize winnings for all the contests I've won for the first time about a month ago and I'm still waiting, there is a waiting period but it's way past that and I still haven't been contacted back about it.   

I have to agree with everything that your blog post says, and also add that almost every single contest WINNER is a stolen design from various stock image websites.

	<TEXT> Territorial Oak has been known to cause the most frightening of glitches. 

One time the game glitched for me in battle; the screen turned black with all menus gone and nothing visible but the oak sprite. The music kept going and he just sat there, couldn't do nothing but reset.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm not really, I've never really seen a guide that just has the level numbers in a table.    


I guess good way to know if you're at the right level is if you can one shot from behind an enemy that's specific to that area. Then you are probably at the right level or even over-leveled.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As long as they don't sell it, say it's better, or imply that it is canon then I don't really have a problem with it. I **think** Itoi guaranteed us that there would never ever be another mother game, and also that he was looking forward to playing one made by the fans. 

//    
  
as a game developer myself if people were to make a spinoff fan game of one of my games I would think that would be really great because they're making a totally new engine, sprites, music, and more for pretty much free. You can see how much they love the game to put in all that work for free.   
//  
edit: Although if you find a new name for the game that's just amazing I would jump on board.

	<TEXT> Sometimes putting it on a mockup gives you a better perspective.   
//   
You could probably do something with the text to bring it out more. Most cards I see have a white font with some sort of shadow, or if it's flat it has a more elegant cursive style. Maybe a thin colored outline.
