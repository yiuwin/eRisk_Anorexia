	<TEXT> Just watching a game between my mates and this happened. 

Two mad scientists on board for mage. Hunter had 1 haunted creeper and two 1/1s.

Hunters turn, decides to take out the two scientists before playing flair, thinking that flair would still take out counter spell if it was in the mages deck. Counter spell triggered and stopped flair, was this always so? If not when did this change? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is something I have noticed to as an outsider (Australian) the fact that politicians are becoming more and more polarized. The gerrymandering is out of control over there.

Just the issue where politics are getting further from compromise as a way to resolve things is scary. 

It is very true that the rest of the world will be affected as the USA is at this time the current super power in the world.

Scary shit man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahaha. Yeah, the place I am renting on the north side atm is about to become a mad house for about a week. So looking to be out of the house for around the next week. 

With several friends of the main tenant coming and staying and bringing drama with them.

So, I have been living in sydney for about 2 months and love it! And I love reddit and redditors, so small experiment where I couch surf with redditors could be fun.

If nothing comes of it, I'll just have to impose on my friends down here.

Of course you'll have to PM for details. And we will prob meet up for coffee to establish that neither of us are axe murders. 

Ha! Here goes nothing, wish me luck and don't be mean. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meetups! 

I am kinda new to sydney myself. Moved down for work and all that. All my friends are couples and I still hang with them a fair bit but have been going out solo as well.

Meetup #1. Went to the soda factory on a monday night. Meet heaps of travelers and expats from different countries around the world. Was awesome with $5 drinks.

Same group as with the original meetup went out to a karaoke night and also went to a bar later that week.

Meetup #2. Business one about marketing and start ups. Both things I am keen on. Went there on a different week on a Wednesday. Couple of free beers later and I have several new friends with similar interests. 

So much out there to do! I am actually on my way to meetup #3! 

We are going to talk about futurism and stuff. Prob going to be awesome. 

So yeah. Scout out meetup groups and go right ahead and introduce yourself. 

Sydney is awesome!  </TEXT>
