	<TEXT> Love the peat :-) Getting to enjoy a few others, particularly highland whiskys, but always go back to the peat. If I had to name one favourite, it would be Lagavulin 16yo, closely followed by Ardbeg 10. Lagavulin is like drinking warm, gold, satin. So smooth </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello techsupport peeps! I'm hoping this is the right sub-reddit to ask this question, but please point me in the right direction if not.

I'm trying to rig together a home cinema using bits and pieces I have. Namely a [Hisense media box](http://www.tracyandmatt.co.uk/blogs/index.php/hisense-1080p-hd-media-player-review), and [BenQ MP620p](http://www.aboutprojectors.com/BenQ-MP620p-projector.html) projector. The media box has outputs of HDMI and RGB component out, and the projector has inputs of VGA (D-sub connector) and S-video. All I've read indicates that whilst boxes can convert from HDMI to VGA, there is some loss of quality. I've half a mind to buy a new media box that has VGA out, but just wanted to get another opinion on how easy\impossible it is to connect these two devices, and how to go about doing so if it was possible\advisable.

Note, I'm not running anything higher than XGA resolution if that makes a difference.

Thanks in advance :-) </TEXT>

In a Laphroaig newsletter, they mentioned some recipes using their whisky - Laphroaig marinaded chicken, that sort of thing. Sounded good, but I didn't see a recipe </TEXT>

TD-S: Talisker Distillery, Skye

5MY: Hmm, not sure but perhaps 5 minimum years, referring to the age of the youngest cask used, but not likely - usually the bottle would pronounce the oldest contents most prominently

	<TEXT> Not Aberlour, but....Whenever I do the weekly shop, I checkout the whisky aisle for any special offers. A couple of months back I noticed Lagavulin 16yo for 28 a bottle (approx $44); usual price is around 42 ($67). There wasn't even a special offer; I figured someone had priced it incorrectly.

I bought 5 bottles, quick sharp, leaving a few behind, and then posted on a whisky forum (whiskymag I think), about it in case anyone else wanted in on the offer. Checked back a few weeks later, and price was back to normal.

By far the best deal I've seen on one of my favourite whiskies, and I still put it down to a pricing error! 

Last best offer was a bottle of Laproaig at 20 (Usually 30 or so), which cheered me up too :-)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually got two bottles of it via the Bladnoch distiller forum online shop; so whilst it's Caol Ila, it's bottled by Bladnoch. I drank one bottle and have the other one stashed for the future; incredibly smooth, the smoothness of Lagavulin but less of a kick. Was a while ago I last tried it, so difficult to describe it any more really. 

They don't appear to have any at at the moment, but they often have a few older bottlings at great prices - worth checking out. [Bladnoch forum bottlings](http://www.bladnoch.co.uk/acatalog/bladnoch-forum-bottlings.html) </TEXT>

On Whiskies though, there are a few taster collection packs you might be interested in. Not sure where you are in the world, but the Whisky Exchange in the UK has a [coastal malts collection](http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/twesearchresult.aspx?q=coastal) along with an island and islay one too I think; all of these three will have some similarities with Talisker (The coastal one includes the standard 10yo) </TEXT>
