	<TEXT> I liked it, but I feel like there could be more. Every track was alright, but I just wanted more from what was going on. It would almost climax and just not happen....especially on the mostly trumpet tracks. I wanted actual solos or more complete ideas rather than small runs on the horn. I haven't listened to much of his music that it seemed to me, that Donald Trumpet wasn't actualy *that* good at trumpet. a 6.8 on my scale easily could have been a 7 out of 10 if he had gone a little further.
