	<TEXT> Yeah, it is all about timing. those enchants and bleeding hollow one for mastery at a point over the weekend sold like hot cakes on 3500G on EU - Argent-Dawn. I bought as many of the precursor mats as possible and made about 50k profit. The prices tanked fast over the last two days and is back now to the normal price of about 1400G per enchant.

Checkout the undermine journal for your realm and the item you want to sell. like this graph will give you an indication of what may happen. You will see that at one point the prices where close to 6000G with about no stock for the Thunderlord https://theunderminejournal.com/#eu/argent-dawn/item/110682  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah warrior rocks. I feel like one with these animations.

Will typically do the following as Prot:

1. Herioc leap to a point just far away from the bunch of mobs so that my intervene / charge spell will be in usage range when I land.
2. As soon as I land I charge to the mobs with a bazing trail.
3. Smash them in the face with shield Slam.
4. Shield block looks really like a block attempt.

Man it feels good :) </TEXT>

Was a grindy experience and the lockouts makes it frustrating if RNG does not go your way. The one week I got only 2 tomes in all of HFC, I had a total of 10 to get so if RNG went my way it could happen in that same week, but it did not. Got 8 in a row the next week though :) </TEXT>

It was a good decision to have the 2H Fury artifact weapons as a set as this makes them one item kinda.

I have multiple hunters each with their own backstory and pets. From a worgen beast master who only uses wolfs, Gara and Skoll as pets to a human marksmanship hunter who never uses a pet.

Call it the OCD or complesionist in me but I would rather quickly (it is very quickly these days) level a Gnome hunter from level 1 and get the Mechano striders in Loch Modan while at it. It also starts with a mechanical pet.

	<TEXT> Then if you mained this toon from vanilla you will always regret not maxing the Ashbringer on it in Legion ;)

I am planning on maining an Arms warrior in Legion due to how brutal the animations look. Also like the idea of feasting in heaven when not slaughtering opponents in the battlefield. Leveled a warrior recently and I am enjoying the massive executes on bosses and players.

Also have a hunter alt with all spirit beasts and exotic pets. Kind of becomes a side game to collect all the rare pets. However what I read of the class for Legion thus far doesn't sound to good. Especially that they removed Glyph of misdirection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I recall reading gear gets scaled for Proving Grounds so doing it at ilvl 600 is no different than ilvl 730.

I recently boosted a new warrior and did it on 640 boosted gear. I had to do it a couple of times over because she would keep on screaming "get these things of off me" and then die even though as you said one would be using threat generating abilities like TC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also the hit box on most bosses is quite big. Sometimes I can stand very far away from the boss and still hit him. This is especially noticeable with a warrior where your charge ability stops at the edge of the boss' hit box.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well quickest but most expensive way is to purchase Champion's Honor item from the AH. It gives 1000 conquest and 1000 honor per seal broken. Depending on your realm it could cost up to 20000 per seal though...
