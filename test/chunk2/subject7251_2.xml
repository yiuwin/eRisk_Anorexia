	<TEXT> Warframes story will never be good. That isn't their strong point. It's too plot hole filled and incoherent. They didn't know what they wanted when they started out and now they're adding random shit that no one cares about. People can try and defend TWW and glass gambit etc etc. But compared to "good" game stories out there, warframes story is very mediocre. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMO, I would say Rhino. Rhino Prime is my favorite frame in the game, simply because he is fairly great at everything. Very tanky with his iron skin, his damage boost from roar starts out at 1.5x without any power strength boost. It effects weapon damage and ability damage for your entire team in the radius, and can be increased to much much higher damage, and his stomp is a fantastic CC.  I'll give you a run down of my 3 builds for rhino that I alternate between depending on the mission.

1) This first build is a pure damage boost build and survivability build that utilizes only highest power strength.  It focuses on buffing Rhino and your group with the highest bonus damage possible, almost 3x damage. This also makes his Iron skin much stronger. Keep in mind that with this build his range is reduced to about 30 feet with roar, so make sure when you cast it your allies are close, but the damage boost is insane. 

2) This build is pure CC, max efficiency and range, with decent duration. This will reduce his stomp cost to 25 energy per cast, and range to freeze them long distances, You can effectively spam his stomp over and over again. Great for defense, Interception, etc. I use zenerik, prime flow, and some energy regeneration pads for this build.

3) This build is just an all around build, useful for really any scenario, range is normal 100% strength and efficiency are 175% and duration is 130%

Basically the point with rhino is he can be built for pretty much any type of situation, and imo roar damage boost is one of the best abilities in the game. </TEXT>
