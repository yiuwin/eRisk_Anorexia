	<TEXT> Yep. Being passed over in college acceptance and hiring, being overwhelmingly victimized in interracial crime, being told our pride is racist, overwhelmingly paying taxes and giving them to welfare leeches who are overwhelmingly non-white... And then being talked down to by resentful minorities who think they have a right to be sanctimonious and say "yes all white people"...

Seeing "black lives matter" every god damn day and having your race blamed for black deaths when, overwhelmingly, blacks kill each other and cops almost never kill innocents... 

Having our entire welfare, education, and economic systems built around serving blacks and being told constantly we're not doing enough to help them, while we sink further into debt and taxation...

Yep, the white victimhood totally isn't a thing. Fuck you if you think blacks are oppressed by anything other than a culture of victimhood and dependence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Indian Point power plant didn't contaminate the Hudson river and posed no danger to the surrounding area. He also lied in saying that we wouldn't lose energy due to it closing.

Fracking hasn't been shown to pose major dangers to the environment, according to the EPA. In fact, many "green" groups used anti-fracking arguments and rhetoric directly fed to them by Russia, who have an interest in preventing natural gas extraction to protect their own state-owned natural gas company, Gazprom. 

Anybody who thinks we can just forsake nuclear energy and natural gas and somehow go 100% renewable immediately is an idiot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *cold open*

Int. shot, some sort of stadium with a crowd. The viewer can clearly see that the crowd is mostly bored and many of them leave as Beyonce or some other overhyped and unloved musician leaves the stage.

HILLARY CLINTON: "The worst thing that can happen in a democracy - as well as in an individual's life - is to become cynical about the future and lose hope."

CROWD: moderate, half-hearted clapping. make most of them clap with one hand

BLACK SCREEN. TITLE GAG: *"Donald wins the election"*

Cue theme music.

INT SHOT: The oval office. It's not immediately clear because the camera is zoomed in on a tweet from Hillary Clinton, but it zooms out to show Donald Trump's extraordinarily small hands. The tweet says:

HILLARY CLINTON: I stand with the people gathered across the country tonight defending our values   our Constitution. This is not who we are.

*Camera switches to view Donald's face. His brow is furrowed in concentration*

Enter STEVE BANNON and REINCE PRIEBUS, walking and talking

STEVE: All I'm saying is, that German guy with the moustache had some good ideas. 

REINCE: You mean Angela Merkel?

STEVE: No, the other one. From the 30s.

DONALD: Can anyone tell me what the hell this says? Constipation? Did I almost lose to an incontinent? 

STEVE: What? 

REINCE: He can't read.

STEVE: You never learned to read? How did you graduate from Wharton Business School without learning to read?

DONALD: I'm a white, straight dude. They just handed out diplomas to us back then. 

REINCE: He just reads the first letter of each word and assumes what they mean. Trust me, nobody understands the subtleties of Donald's retardation more than me. 

DONALD: Alright, alright, look, where's that Executive Order I signed? Keeping all the Moslems out?

STEVE: You mean this one?

STEVE pulls out a seemingly-discarded napkin. It has stains on it, and some incomprehensible symbols.

STEVE: Donald, let me read this to you and see if it makes sense to you.

DONALD: Alright, okay.

STEVE: Hello, fellow American. No more... bomb... not even the word, a drawing of a bomb. No more bomb person in the University Statues of... I leave power. Good. Thank you. Crime, they'll be lower... son. This, is this a stain? What were you eating, chili? 

REINCE: Hey, don't throw that out, that's perfectly good chili.

STEVE: This doesn't make any sense!

DONALD: Look, it's, kind of symbolic, you know? But fine, write it yourself, say whatever you want, just put my name on it.

STEVE: What degree did they give you at Wharton? I can't imagine - 

DONALD: Bird Law. Look, it's complicated, alright? Bird law in this country -

Enter IVANKA, yelling over everyone. 

IVANKA: Hey dickweeds, guess what?

EVERYBODY ignores her. They stop arguing, staring at her.

IVANKA: Nordstrom stopped selling my clothes!

EVERYBODY continues to stare at her. Awkward silence ensues.

REINCE: Is that uh -

IVANKA: Guys, come on, this is big news.

REINCE: No, but uh, is that, are we supposed to care?

STEVE: Yeah, uh, we're a little busy, with other things...

DONALD: Bird law, and banning the browns.

IVANKA: Oh really? That's more important than my clothes?

EVERYBODY, in unison: YES. 

IVANKA: I guess I'll be dealing with this myself then.

STEVE: Have fun, now back to the important business... I had an idea about how to get Russia to love us. Two words: Dick towels.

*commercial break*

Keep tuned for more of It's Always Sunny in Washington D.C.!

The many charitable and social services programs who can't afford to pay their workers as a result. I've met with dozens of organizations that help foster parents, young underprivileged kids, cancer patients, and more and the biggest complaint from all of them is that they can't afford to pay their workers. Because guess what, they're non-profits. This hurts everyone *except big businesses* more.

Oh, and the best part is that all these groups want more government funding to cover their losses. Just another reason for the government to spend more damn money. Fuck the economically illiterate short-term thinkers who want to double the minimum wage. </TEXT>

Oh come now, what a poor argument. Jesus called his followers to abandon their families! Surely you can at least give up your material goods and become Amish or something, right?

That's not a Biblical quote, it is Ben Franklin or someone like that.

It was Algernon Sidney who said that. I'm surprised you're claiming the Bible is the ultimate authority of faith - whatever happened to Holy Tradition? 

Furthermore, there are numerous Biblical verses that support the idea (there being more evidence for it than many articles of "Tradition"), such as Proverbs 6:10-11, 12:11, 12:24, 13:4, and I Timothy 5:8.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At this point I have pretty much no choice but to think you are intentionally being obtuse.

Why, because I'm agreeing with OP's assessment? 

Of course it is wrong for me to have what I have, and I'm not denying that.

It's not "wrong" of you to own anything. What tomfoolery. Do you think Jesus would deny that you can own something that you earned with the sweat of your labor? Surely not - he didn't even support the abolition of slavery! 

If it *is* wrong, sell it instead of flagellating yourself.

 But at least have the honesty to not just straight up ignore the literal words of Christ.

Why should I care what Christ said, exactly, especially if you don't? After all:

Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn to attack you. Matthew 7:6

Dogs and swine! And there are those among the poor who are dogs are swine, no denying it.

For you will always have the poor with you Matthew 26:10

We will never eliminate poverty. How silly is it to insist that we should make ourselves poor in order to help the poor? There is only one mechanism which had greatly reduced world poverty. 

In any case, I do quite a lot of volunteer work and donate quit a bit to charity: But I hate those naive folks who believe that, in the name of "charity", the government should use force to redistribute people's money. That is my problem with this post.

Okay, so give up your life and become a monk or a vagrant. 

Our labor is nothing.

So what's the point of working? Let's all just become vagrants and let the filth accumulate around us. Proverbs 12:11, Proverbs 12:24, Proverbs 14:23, 2 Timothy 2:6, those verses don't mean anything. God doesn't help those who help themselves, he helps those who don't bother

A priest might.

Priests don't speak for God. It's incredibly arrogant for them to presume so. Surely, if priests *did* speak for God we wouldn't have so many different priests saying so many different things. I'll believe the word of God if he ever sees fit to speak to me; I won't believe a priest for no reason. (By the way, priests get paid, right? Is their labor nothing? Do they not deserve money?) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shouldn't we be looking for our punishment 

I wouldn't ask for any such thing. If God sees fit to punish, he will do so.

And not for unjust rewards

Keep in mind, you're saying that the money that I earned through my labor is an "unjust reward"...

Have you tried returning it to its owner, then?

Yeah, he hasn't returned my calls. </TEXT>

The many parts of the Bible wherein the wicked are punished. More importantly, I was responding to someone who said "everything belongs to God". If so, it's not really my place to give it away, is it? </TEXT>

The discrepancy between total number of electors and real number of electors is because I was forced to technically join a few states together in order to do this, so states don't have the correct number of "senate" electors.
