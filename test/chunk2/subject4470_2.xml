	<TEXT> Thanks for the link. They just got a new subscriber to their YT channel, despite some of their episodes/snippets not being subtitled. The content and the way the show seems to be produced, has an aire of carelessness to it; which I like and is probably what they are trying to convey (I know they probably are well advised in what they are trying to pull off, but it doesn't seem like it's overly produced, is all I'm trying to say).

Is the show still running? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shit, man. You're pretty much talking about Nirvana in post-mortem. It's usually pretty easy to remember *those things*. Remembering what they (alongside plenty of others did....i.e. Melvins, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, etc, etc). 

What the thing is; is that these fuckers perservered. Despite the tides. And by "tides", I mean they were going against the current. This particular 'current', being *music*. If you can't appreciate that...well, I don't know what to tell you. They were progressives. Just like I see Buscemi as. He's got a funny look and mannerisms to him (not really IMHO), but people like to see realism on film. We, in-turn say, we like what we see, by paying $ for films and the cycle continues.

Steve Buscemi, in my book, is one of the greatest actors of my time. Character roles, or Boardwalk, or not.  </TEXT>

I used to have a very hard time saying "no".  These days; after experiencing, as well as, seeing how many people behave, my outlook on the subject has changed a little.
I
am still seen as pretty left of the hill but, yet, have developed an admittedly cold hearted attitude, sadly. I dont like it, necessarily, but I also don't necessarily like how I have seen people behave like when I've been on the streets.

	<TEXT> I agree with you on pretty much every point you have just given, except, for one. I think it would be seen as *worse*, if a chain-type of type restaurant were to serve something like this. You don't become successful, for no reason. As a successful business, on the other hand, you *must* cater to making things as easy as possible for your people,  (repeat customers are awesome). Your friends are your friends. And they'll be there no matter what. Hopefully, lol.

In all honesty, I just thought it funny how serious some people were getting here about a picture of a plate, created by an amateur (and still accredited the dish to its proper), and posted online. 


I get excited about food. And kudos to OP for cooking. IMO, more people in this world should know how to cook.



E: Added *as possible* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey. I never said I would present this particular dish this way (OP's way).

And the term *rustic* can be seen as half-assing it, from a plating perspective. And you know what? I've been cooking in commercial kitchens for around 10 years now and couldn't give a fuck less about presentation. If it's food and it's good the people will eat it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahaha, you sound either like a troll, or indeed, a chef. A pompous moron.

Like I said earlier it is cracked by the BOH and cooked, or vice versa. Either way the shit you aren't intended to eat is washed away by the time it reaches the table. Don't be daft. </TEXT>

The picture is from someone following a recipe from a fucking book. They arent cooking fucking professionally. Jesus

	<TEXT> lol, you get the plate prepared to you that (hopefully!) has most of the parts of the body in-tact. As someone that prepares the meal, they will take the utmost care it cracking the body of crab or lobster (or whatever other exoskeleton-type of animal
 away from the food).

Ever wonder why you never get shell in your scrambles? Or hardly ever get bone in your food? 

E: And no, I would personally, not mind having to dig that out of a plate of pasta.
