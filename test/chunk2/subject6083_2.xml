	<TEXT> Out of all the hosts, I only watch Wings' videos, Woody's Mail Monday and PKA (even when he posted other stuff, I stuck to those two), and the occasional Kyle video on his FPS channel.

I don't care what Woody does with his life, whether he comes back to Youtube or sticks mainly with his Minecraft server; I have more important things to worry about, like real life.

PKA is one thing I enjoy though. But lately they've been talking way too much about haters. The haters really do get to them, even though they say they're ignored. It's annoying hearing them rant every week. I might stop watching soon, or just skip over the hater based parts if this keeps up.

I really like PKA. Except for the basketball talk, LOL. I actually follow the NBA, they don't seem to know much hahahaha

	<TEXT> I've been hearing that for a long time now. They (mainly Woody and Lefty) always talk about the shitty criticism they receive, where they get insulted, etc. But they never address the legitimate constructive criticism they get, sometimes even on this subreddit, which they browse often.

The hater talk has started to take up a considerable amount of the show. Sometimes they do take note of the nice things that come their way, but it's mostly all about the hate. It's obvious they're not able to ignore it even though they say they do. I find it hilarious, lol </TEXT>

So by taking out features and putting them back in future instalments, they can and will pretend as if it's new technology, something a lot of people will fall for and it will be perceived as "new."

	<TEXT> With the last patch they implemented an always online DRM... it's bullshit, as it makes most of the game unplayable to a lot of people. Maybe that's the reason? It's happening to me too, for the past 4 days.

Edit: My Xbox is always connected to my internet, but I'm not subscribed to Xbox Live at the moment. Do you think the game will work if I get XBL?

Edit 2: I see some people are saying if you create a new gamertag the game will work perfectly fine, as it should. Again, bullshit. </TEXT>

I got that with an athletic 6' PG in a Rookie Showcase 2-3 days ago. It felt amazing.

The negative side of it? That's when the 2K servers started getting down (still are) and I got sent back to the main menu after the game. It didn't count :( I can't get even get close to that number of rebounds now. </TEXT>

There's one player in my team who's minus 17, but he's injured. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember for 2k13 there was a MyNBA2k app for Apple and I think Android as well that let you get VC without actually playing the game.

Is there something similar for the PS4/Xbox One versions?

If not, what are the best ways to get VC in the game? I've been playing MyGM, 6min per quarter for 515 VC per game.

Also, how do you personally play Blacktop to win the game as quickly as possible. What player do you play as and who do you go up against? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I should have probably posted this in another subreddit because I'm sure this doesn't only happen in 2k14. </TEXT>
