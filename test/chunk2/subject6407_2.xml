	<TEXT> Based on my analysis of these pictures, I can assess that the people grilling this child for her milestone are either:

A) Impudently ignorant despite the fact that, comparatively, they have most likely have not read anywhere near 1% of books at that age.

Or...

B) They are impertinent bastards who profusely complain about how they have "been there, done that" to get a fucking cookie, but they disregard the fact that they were only doing as they were told, and not utilizing the fruit of knowledge for the benefit of its application. And although I cannot blame them for their decision-making skills as four-year-olds; I can perpetually scold them for their poor excuse for egregious behavior as adults. Fuck them all.

All I have to say for the girl is to push herself to the stars, for she can accomplish many things that these would-be whiners could not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because many J. Cole fans want to classify themselves in a completely different intelligence group in comparison to people that listen to other musicians (specifically rappers and hip hop artists). However, many have considered J. Cole's music to be plain, clich, and only of intellectual thought on some occasion. What the meme is trying to point out is the superficial gratitude of unmatched intelligence that a certain person feels when they listen to J. Cole recreationally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like Chasing the Scream, it's a book that talks about the multiple stances on how to end the drug war and the history of how the drug war started, it's very controversial. You'll read it and think to yourself that the author is crazy, but he brings up facts and quite reliable sources. Another book that I like is Mistakes Were Made. Basically, it's a book on cognitive dissonance, it can be a really helpful tool when you have problems admitting fault and making the wrong decision. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I live right next to Colma, California. And this town is notorious for having only about 3000 living people in comparison with over 2 million dead people because of the huge amount of cemeteries that surround the smaller neighborhoods here. There's not really any ghost sightings that I've heard of, ironically. Sometimes there would be news stories people leaving organs and candles at grave sites and stuff, but that's it. ANYWAYS, this happened last year and I was awake in my bedroom at 3 AM on instagram in pitch black. All of the sudden I hear this very long and painful wail from a woman. Now Colma is a completely quiet town, and just hearing this was straight up unsettling. It lasted about 10 seconds. I tried going on yik yak to check if anybody heard it. Apparently, people from 1-2 miles away even heard this wail. Idk maybe somebody must have sprained their leg or REALLY bad or something, but how I was listening to it, it sounded like it came from the Chinese Cemetery that borders my apartment complex, didn't hear anything after that. It just returned to the town's normal abrupt silence.  </TEXT>
