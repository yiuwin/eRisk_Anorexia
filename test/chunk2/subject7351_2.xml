	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> His account was just hacked by somebody who used a website to buy some FIFA coins, he allegedly payed 30 to get 100 worth of coins, then somehow gained access to my brothers account, he then got onto his account and purchased 110 of psn credit using his debit card. what can my brother do about this? the person who did it sounded and claimed that they were in the same country as us (UK) would he be able to claim fraud and take some action against him or just contact psn/bank and get his money back?

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The current 3 options do not cover a wide enough of scenarios to cover what can happen in games,i have been in at least 2 games today, where at least 1 member of my team half way through competitive completely refuses to try anymore, they will just run around near spawn or just jump into the enemy team, so we can not report them for AFK 

I had somebody earlier who left his previous game, rejoined overwatch within a minute, and instead of being put back in his original game, he was set into a new one, he was so pissed of that he stuck with a widowmaker on king of the hill type maps, and just stood near our spawn fucking about for all 3 rounds. </TEXT>
