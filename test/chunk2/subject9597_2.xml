	<TEXT> "Friends."  I love the characters, I love the jokes, and I love how much fun the cast had during the 10 seasons of the show.  By far one of my top three shows that I have watched. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've got a fear that my friends are just hanging out with me just because they feel like they have to.

For a long time now I've had a lot of thoughts that if I were to not be there, there wouldn't be much of a difference in what was going on.   Like if I was to get up and walk away, they may not notice sometimes. </TEXT>
