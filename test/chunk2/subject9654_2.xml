	<TEXT> Pubs mate..

Look around to ur local pubs.

Round here there is like 15-17 of them.
every day of the week they all have deals.

i can go and tonight get  250Gm sirloin  chips and salad  9.90.
12 bucks with a midi.


Last week another place had a scnity and salad for 8 bucks.
Like wtf are they stealing the chickens or some shit to keep them that cheap.


I mean that's cheaper than most ppl can afford to make a meal with.

Also go to Aldi around 6pm before close you can grab some wickhed smaht deals i walked in the other night they had 400gm packs of rum going for 4 bucks.
whole fresh chickens that still had 2 days on them for 3.99. and bags of salad for 50c.

You can do it easily.
just be really frugal.
And steer clear of name brands

Also shopadockets.
a fair few stores are on shopadockets.

i can grab a  meal at the  a few restraunts and you get the 2nd free </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The $560 figure is a gross distortion of reality which is claimed by the gay marriage lobby.
 
 
 It's not actually.
http://www.pwc.com.au/press-room/2016/cost-plebiscite-mar16.html

PWC  board is made up of former LNP staffers and ex liberal Vic members.  it's the modelling agency  that hte liberals use 99 percent of the time otherwise it's orima.

 The real cost of the plebicite is approximately $120M.

the 120M  does not factor in productive loss for the saturday  of ppl not working,PWC modeling does.

anyway your clearly a shill so i think im done

Wow i don't want to breach the sub rules.
but holy crap that's stupid stuff.

Plebiscites can be legally binding.
The swedes just had one to debate MP wages.
The outcome was mandated  to be passed.


Or i dunno we could of just had a referendum  last election

The director of the AEC even said it would of only cost 11 million dollars to add it on and have it the same day.

11 million vs the 560 million of the liberals plebiscite.
party of fiscal plans my arse

Im new here,so im not sure but are u like a staffer for the party  or something.
i just went through your post history it only ever boils down to But labor.
Again though LABOR ARE NOT IN GOVT so this point is  not to be included in the debate.

Ive never said labor aint shit as well.
Julia could of got this through but never did so fuck her as well.

But again Labor are not in govt,LNP is and we shouldnt need to have a stupid option pole that members have openly said they would vote against even if the ppl in the electorate said yes.

No where but in the bible  is it mandated that we need marriage.
Just abolish the whole thing and let everyone have civil ceromonys

	<TEXT> As much as i  hate this govt.

This is a reasonable cut that was proposed.

Well i mean as much as being a heartless cunt can be.

i mean fuck  you clearly have enough income to get the pension down from 747 down to 20.20.
You can afford 2 lose the pension card.

Or why don't they just cut the extra 20 off them and let them keep the card.

The age pension CAN NOT.
I REPEAT CAN NOT.
Keep getting a free fucking pass every budget cycle cause everyone is afraid of losing votes.

So it's become quite clear.

That the cuts will be making.

Medicare more productive  "SUSTAINBLE"  AKA how many  ppl can we let die from lack of services before we lose polling?.

And youth and DSP cut's again.

I can bet you my mouth on a gloryhole at a truck stop on the hume. that the DSP is gonna get a serious thrashing in trying to get more of them off the payment and into work.

We won't see any proposal for a land tax.
or any reduction in negative gearing.
We sure as shit won't see them raise capital gains   as it needs to be.

Sure as fucking shit won't see them ask resource companys to pop a few quid in the bucket.

It's time boy's and girls.
Time for that yearly tradition.
That lovely lovely  caring and giving time of the liberal party. 
That time,We call Budget season

When the citizens have to unzip our  pant's bend over and prepare to get fucked with a massive coal ridden  strap on by scott morrison as he has become so toxic that he now suffers from male erecticle dysunction he has  to use a strapon to provide sexual pleasures to his party.
Let's all bend over and take it like the good citzens we are.

While company's get to  hide 40 billion a a year in untaxed profits every year.

While the same company's then has it's herpes infested mouth piece  kate carnahan come onto tele and tell everyone company's should pay less tax and citizens more.

But yes,by all fucking means  let's stick your fucking old man burns fucking uncut fingernail yeast infected fingers into the pocket's of kids fresh out of school.
Let's call the kids lazy fucking cunts on national tele as we get ramped up by budget fever to attack welfare bludgers.
Even though we have 1 job for every 8.2 ppl.  those others 7.2 ppl are just lazy,sad,low energy wastes of carbon and oxygen  ingestion on the planets resources.

It must be nothing to do with the govt's lack of investement in a science or research and renewables economy that was worth 2 trillion which we now missed the train on.

No your right.
Those 7 ppl are just lazy asscunts.


let's not look at the 30 billion a year that the family's get.Just for having a fucking baby.
Just add childcare to a universal payments program it would cost 7.2 billion a year once we clear out or the money grabbing enterprises.

Let us not look at   sanitarium and the 2.2 billion in profit it made in 2016 that was untaxed.

Fuck you   turnbull you gutless fucking pig,at least im safe in knowing that a piece of bacteria stuck to the inside of a fucking shit infested portaloo at  the falls festival has more spine  and integrity in it than our entire govt does.

You also need to be ready for spot inspections. Like LOTS.
Lot's and lot's and if u fail more than 1 ur out.
Make sure all your tools are in the car.
your safety gear is up to code.
a lot of rules and policy shit.

They can just pop by anytime while ur on the job too.

It's also pretty annoying 2 if the unit ur attached 2 is full of fucking shit cunt's who like to talk about nothing but beer and  last nights gogglebox episode,and how this one time  dave met nollsy.

The work week varies,you can be doing a job in town to maintain services  or checking for system interruption possibilities on 100km of line from   albury to  fuckoffnowhere.
Also prepare to get chewed out.
Line goes down,But you tell the office there is no supply of correct  fittings  and materials closest is 400km away..they don't care somehow they expect you to go home and kill ur son in a blood offering to Cthulhu to repair the system


However  there are a lot of chicks on the field now oddly.
some pretty fine chicks too,and it get's really lonely on a 3 hour drive to fucking butt fuck nowhere and ur chances are pretty good. </TEXT>

the latest reactor in the US.
at watts  bay took 18 years of planning.
1.2 Billion just for the design phase,before any concrete was poured
and it's expected to hit 6.6 by Turn key phase.

That's in the US where they know how to fucking build these things so well they can put them in a fucking sub.

this would be our first one since lukas heights
And with our tendering process no way we get it done for less than 15 billion and less than 15 years 
then the govt  will stick it's micropenis into the batter and make it cost more

If we are going to go down this route look ahead.

i noticed aldi men can wear shorts now. as long as they are "Aldi" blue

my current job women can wear sandals  like birkenstocks and  slip on's and flats and shit.
We have  to wear a Dress type shoe with  white socks
I find it BS that we can't wear sandals,sitting at ur desk trying to refill the murray basin with the sweat from ur feet.

	<TEXT> Optus don't really own any ISP,they just charge a fee for access to the  fibre network they maintin in the citys and connections to SEA where they have a huge presence from SINGTEL

Telstra though runs.
Bigpond/telstra/Belong/MateCommunicate/Active8Me 3 others but i can't think of the name right now


Vocus,who used to be M2. Or  AKA DODO.
Own the following.
Eftel,Clubtelco,Ishitmus,amnet.aanet,and nextgen networks.DODO 

They have pretty poor peering arrangements and  are known to  have peak hour issues on a lot of NBN POI  systems due to not having enough CVC capacity  steer clear if ur in a built up area


TPG owns the following..
 	Adam Internet
AAPT Limited  SHIT(17 faults on there backend network in the last 15 months one lasted for 2 days  so fuckign shit)
Agile Communications Shit unless ur looking for a SLA agreement then they become good and start making ur boy parts feel real good.
Chime Communications SHIT
iiNet Customer service went to shit.
Internode See above
Netspace  Dead it's just IINET
PIPE Networks  Still half decent corporate services and peering arrangements 
TransACT  Ballarat and geelong HFC can reach speeds of 850Mbps  easily with no errors on the network they currently have it uncapped to 250Mbps down which is a plus sign for HFC if it's done right.
Westnet dunno?

Tpg i will admit have wisened up slightly and are slowly trying to upgrade the services they offer.
the problem is they are always weeks late to the party.
They chuck more CVC  onto the system,it get's gobbled back up in a day or 2 and then ur back to congestion problems they need to buy it in 100Mbit blocks not the 15 they do now.


Then you have the smaller firms.
and asian firms putting foot into the water

Skymesh,Aussie broadband,AusBBS,Leaptel,Tangerine,Bendigo bank, Mynetfone myrepublic 
Most of them run the networks off AAPT back ends if they provide an unlimited service  if it's usually got a quota on the plan then it will generally be vocus. and a little bit of telstra in there as well if u live off the aapt/vocus grid

Then you have the ppl just in it to make money that can't sustain  the service they provide.

Like my republic,how anyone with basic math skills can think they can sustain 100mbps with no data caps for 59 a month when that costs them 50 bucks from NBN co alone. eventually too many ppl will join cause of the ZOMG THE PRICE IS SO LOW. and clusterfucks will ensue 

Your best bet right now,especially if you get a FTTN  connection is to go with a small firm that can chase down service fault's instead of reading of a  fault script next to their computer in the Philippines.


Please,People  im begging you. DO NOT  GIVE TELSTRA  your fucking money,they are shit.
I mean yeah they have a fuck tone of back haul capacity  but that's cause they  have so many old fuck users who never use the full 500gb they get so they have plenty to spare. plus the prices are  fucking trump level's of stupidity

i mean if you can  haggle them into giving you Foxtel and NBN for under 100 like some users managed to then fuck yeah do that shit.
Otherwise the only interaction you should have with telstra is when u get your dog(or Cat im not going to judge you if you are sick in the head and think it's fine to own a fucking feral piece of shit like a cat) to take a big stinking  grass filled shit right in a high traffic area so somone steps on it  on the shop floor and then start  walking away   </TEXT>
