	<TEXT> When I am deep thought and/or not wearing my glasses, I scowl. As in "I will drown you in gasoline then toss a lit match on your corpse" scowl. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Grandma didn't switch from dial-up until a year ago. I can still remember hearing Grandpa try to connect and smile because he would always swear when it wouldn't hook. He passed in '14 and that sound hasn't rang since. Really though, on an acreage there is always something to do besides stare at a screen. The only reason she has high speed is because my little sister is home-schooled due to our bullying problem and has a tendency to spend the odd week there to keep grams company.  </TEXT>
