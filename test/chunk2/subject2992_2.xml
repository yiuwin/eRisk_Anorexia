	<TEXT> There's so many funny things that happen at my high school. One of my favorites was sophomore year when we were taking the CAHSEE. The entire sophomore class (which was pretty damn big) were sat in the gym taking the test, and it was dead silent (standardized tests in the US are strict). Then, all of a sudden, there was the sound (coming from the opposite side of the gym that I was on) of someone shifting in their chair, and then a crack. So a bunch of people looked up (including me) and then a kid's chair just completely collapsed and he fell to the ground and went, "BAH!" And then his sister started crying from laughing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time I was in Vegas for my friend Andy's 21st birthday and we had a weird experience in an elevator. We had just gone down to the main level of Harrah's to get some food, and our trip up was probably one of my top 5 favorite memories with those people. Andy booked a big suite that was on the top floor, so we'd have to ride all the way up. As soon as the elevator doors opened, Call Me Maybe was pretty much blasting. There were 4 other people in there, obviously pretty drunk. One lady was holding a speaker with her phone connected to it, and everyone else was holding those rediculously large drinks that everyone in Vegas always has. And these people were going HARD. They were dancing and singing and jumping, and we decided to join in. I have a video of this too, which I'll share if requested. So the 3 of us who had left the room--Andy, Katie, and I--started jumping around and screaming the lyrics like idiots. So at one point, this one guy was dancing so wildly that he accidentally slapped Katie in the face, which I got on camera. She started laughing her ass off, and the guy goes, "OH MY GOD I'M SO SORRY! I'M SORRY!" but keeps dancing. Then the elevator doors opened and we were at the top floor. After we got off, we realized that those people never got off. Who knows how long they were riding that elevator up and down for...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At my height (between 5'8" and 5'9") you have to be at least 110 lbs. and that's at the very least. But t it's weird because the shorter you are, the more you have to weigh, which I've never really understood.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thyroidectomy. I was 11 and had to get a major surgery to remove my thyroid, thanks to Graves' disease. I was out for the 5-hour-surgery, but when I woke up, the worst pain I've ever felt. My throat was burning, my head was pounding, my neck was throbbing--the works. I was pumped full of pain killers, but I needed even more. Then the painkillers made me nauseous and they didn't want me throwing up since I had to stay in bed (also, I just had surgery in the neck). They then added a medication used to stop nausea for chemo patients). But the few days after that surgery were the absolute worst pain I've felt in my almost 18 years of life so far.  </TEXT>
