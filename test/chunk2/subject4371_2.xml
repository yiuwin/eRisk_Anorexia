	<TEXT> So many cool cards, but some that captured my imagination were:

[[Chaos Orb]] - What card is cooler than this, really?
[[Berserk]] - What the card does along with the art is just so great to me.
[[Candelabra of Tawnos]] - When I found out about this card, I thought it was laughably useless. I obviously still had a lot to learn at that point. When I was told by a friend why this card was not useless, I could only admire the simplicity of the text and inherent potential.  
[[Dakkon Blackblade]] - The coolest, most bad-ass dude ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, when I was making the piece I was wondering if I was being too blatant. But what I found out was that in general, people didn't know exactly what they were looking at - that I wasn't blatant enough. The viewers mostly got the general idea, but there is a lot of "is that a....(body part X)?" 
The shaft like shape you see as a penis on the bottom left (middle bottom) is supposed to be a female leg of sorts. And actually the whole piece is supposed to be female parts (except for a small male, distorted figure in the center of the painting) but I can easily understand people seeing all sorts of things in this painting.
"fairly clear outline of the body of a woman from boob to bum" - this was my intention, but a lot of people do not notice this. Cool that you saw it.
"amalgamation of mouth and tongue" - In my mind, it is a person sucking on a lip attached to a face with a large mouth - what appears to be a large hole is the inside of the mouth.
While these particular parts of the painting are fun to talk about, it's not important that the viewer's interpretations match perfectly with what I intended - in fact, if this happened then I wouldn't have done a very good job at making the painting mysterious. As long as the over all feel of the painting is maintained, then I feel like I've done something right. 
Thank you for explaining some of your thoughts on the painting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted the piece to heavily imply orifices, bodies, body parts, and sexuality without being completely explicit or descriptive of anything too specific.  The way you put it is pretty much how I wanted somebody to react - maybe the viewer is thinking "is this what I think it is, or is it just ME?". It's funny you mention the internet. This piece came about as a reaction to online dating - how after a while it can seem like a "meat market" and how sexuality in general can overwhelm your thoughts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I want to make a new portfolio, I will definitely hit you up for this. From time to time, they show articles on the WotC page that go over the art descriptions and process of making certain cards - problem is, they show the art in these articles, so it's too late for my purposes. And actually I went to the site you linked, but after reading one article I had to turn away so I didn't match more descriptions with images. 
If I am ready to do a new piece with this process, I will let you know. Thank you for the offer to help :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know what you mean about the Darklit Gargoyle. At that time I was soooo focused on rendering that I missed the mark on other things - like the MTG universe feel. Most of them need more creativity on this front. I wont blame my shortcomings on this, but WotC does provide World Books to the artists that show the entire look and feel of the characters, culture, clothes, environments, etc.  - so the "look" of things is largely (but not completely) taken care of for the illustrator, which is a huge help.
Bloodied Ghost could use more work, yes. I did it in about 2 hours and wasn't as invested in it like I was the other pieces. But at the same time I think it has a nice simple clarity to it, so I included it in this album.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I chose all of these cards using the same process (except Preacher). I looked at the card text only and specifically avoided looking at the original art so I wouldn't be influenced by it. Because of this, I had to avoided cards that I already knew the art for (which is a lot). So my enthusiasm for making the art was based on the name, functionality, and flavor of the card. 
One time, I read the description of Ruric Thar, The Unbowed and I was getting psyched up to do a piece based on his card text. Then at an FNM I was looking through somebodies trading binder and saw Ruric! It was a double whammy. Now that I had seen it, I couldn't UNSEE it. But also, the art for him is AWESOME. It's probably for the best I didn't try because I don't think I could top it, let alone match it. I actually ended up meeting this artist and told him the story, pretty funny.

	<TEXT> My process for all of these (except Preacher) was to only read the text of the cards, but NOT look at the art. I knew that I would be too influenced by the original art if I saw it. This is the closest way I have found to matching the art orders that WotC gives the artists and hence the process the artists go through. 
It was always exciting to FINALLY see the original card art after I was done with my version. One thing I noticed was that the original always seemed more, for lack of a better word, "Magical". Mine were usually a little less creative than the MtG world requires and it's something that needs to be addressed if I give it another go. And yes, in most cases (if not all) just starting a new piece is better than trying to fix something older up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for taking the time out to give your thoughts and advice. I agree with you on the points you made about the individual pieces - especially the Archer. I am happy with the colors and composition, but I agree she is way too generic and has proportional issues. 
More than half of these pieces are several years old. I know they are not perfect but I figured, why not show these pieces to everybody - as opposed to them collecting digital dust (or actual dust in the case of the one painted in oils). So this was more of a sharing thing than an official portfolio thing. 
If I were to give the Wizards submission thing another go, I would probably ditch some of the pieces you mentioned and/or fix them up and make new ones of course. 
I have gone to 2 tournaments to meet artists and get their feedback, which was cool, but I have not been to a convention and met any of the higher-ups and/or art director. I did consider going to PAX, but then I found out it's like impossible to get a ticket. Had no idea these conventions sell out with blinding speed. 
Do you or have you made art for Wizards?
Regardless, I thank you again for your help. </TEXT>
