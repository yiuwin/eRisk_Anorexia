	<TEXT> I think there were a couple of factors that made that tackle on Tuilagi so outrageous. At this period, Tuilagi was virtually unstoppable. It would always take two or three players to take him down so for Warburton to stop him from 5 yards out was quite impressive.  

Secondly the sheer depth he managed to get to you wrap himself around Manu's ankles was an achievement in itself. I think this submission is more for the technicality than awe factor.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, its the 78th minute. England are winning 19-14 in a gruelling yet entertaining match. The chorus of Swing Low is bellowing from the stands as Eddie Jones does his best to conceal a grin. Jonny May weaves down left wing and places the ball ba-  

DAVID POCOCK swoops in akin a wallaby on acid prizing the ball from Jonny's timid fingers, he flies down the wing swatting away Farrell with his bear shaped paws. He surges over the whitewash swiftly followed by Hooper wooping harder than a Freshman after his first keg. This is their moment. 19-19 time to get payback for that disgusting, horrifying summer. Foley steps up. The crowd trying to maintain decorum shhh themselves into a respectful silence. He swoops the ball to the left of the sticks. Pocock gets his glory and England get a pissy little draw. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As it's Thursday and we near the excitement of a weekend of rugby madness. I ask this community what your fondest Autumn international memory is. 

For me personally it must be England beating New Zealand in 2012. I could not believe what I was watching. I miss Manu's form! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello lads. As some of you may know I own a very small [Youtube](https://www.facebook.com/RugbyRulesShowcase/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel) channel and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RugbyRulesShowcase/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel) page.  

I have been looking to gain followers for some time and I am going to do a "Like and share" giveaway soon to get a bit of a larger following.

I was wondering if any of our community had any interesting items or kit that they could suggest to give away. In addition to this if anybody is interested in selling me some items then comment below and I'll get in touch!  

Thanks,  

Rugby Rules! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot mate. Usually after a big game I will watch the whole game, they tend to do a lot of good replays on sky and the BBC so you have plenty of footage to work with. However there are also some big games like the six nations matches that incorporate other angles as well!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a very fair comment. I would have loved to have gone down that line however because the match was filmed in the US there was very VERY little replays or slow motion images. Therefore it is hard to combine a more epic soundtrack to your stock sideline footage. 

Before the game I had in mind getting some slo motion images of the hake and the foley "8" circle to build some atmosphere. However there was simply no images used by the host company. Therefore I had to use what I could which wasn't that great. 

Really wish the BBC had filmed it!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have not much knowledge of what teams are prominent in American Rugby however I will attempt to give you an overview of rugby in Europe. 

In my head rugby is the second biggest sport here apart from football (soccer). International matches always draw in huge crowds here and it is a great event. Union is without a doubt the more popular apart from maybe in the North of England where cities like Leeds and Hull enjoy a dominance in League. I would suggest You tubing a beginners guide to rugby union.  Either way rugby is an excellent way to meet people and it will affect your life in a positive way. Message me for further info and questions.  


Trust me. Get into RUGBY. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that Game of Thrones could have created some unreal hype before the Battle of the Bastards. I would have loved to have seen a promo showing the Boltons preparing to flay someone. The camera could cut to the victim on the cross looking terrified whilst there were short, fleeting glimpses of a man sharpening a blade. This suspense would continue building until the flaying is about to start when the promo cuts out. All mixed in with tense music and dark imagery this could have been a truly tense but amazing promo.  

Flaying is what makes the Bolton's such a formidable and feared house in my opinion. This may have been a bit over the top but does anyone else not want to know more about their strange and twisted tradition? </TEXT>

Alternatively can anybody suggest an alternative screen capture program that has no image performance loss that is free?
