She wants some form of coffee table, preferably two of them. That or small sideboards.

I'm fairly limited in my skills, only what I have been taught in my Resistant Materials lessons at school, which is fairly limited. 

I also have a limited amount of tools, but I do have a fairly hefty table saw available for use. 

I'm also trying to limit other cost as much as I can.

So, suggestions?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mother would like me to make a couple of small coffee tables for her new conservatory. I was wondering what to make the legs out of. I was thinking of acquiring some banister spindles and cutting them to size. I do not have a lathe or the facilities to turn wood. My dad recently invested in a table saw, so that should help, he has said I can use it. I also have a jigsaw.

Any suggestions?

EDIT: Photos of slab - http://imgur.com/a/LLp0D

I also got some measurements - 1300 by 1000mm. Thickness is the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For a start: do not make it a reboot. Make it a continuation of the series' that have come before, and wrap them up. So, obligatory scenes with Sam Carter, Teal'c, Daniel Jackson and Jack O'Neill, assuming Richard Dean Anderson loses a substantial amount of weight.

As for the main team, I would like to see Oscar Isaac play the geeky type character, Daniel Craig as the tough military leader, Peter Capaldi as the villain. As for the other characters, open auditions to hopefully find a relatively unknown actor who seriously kicks ass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello all,

Currently studying Treaty of Versailles for my History GCSE and the crippling military limits placed on Germany by the Diktat.

I was wondering if this would be an implementable thing in EU4. Say for instance I am playing as Prussia, and I have beaten the Polish in war to conquer greater Poland. I don't want them to be able to rebuild sufficiently to beat me for them back, because even without the additional provinces, they still have a fairly large Army compared to me, and without my buddy Russia, would probably beat me when the truce ends.

As such, I may want to place a limit on the size of their army, so that instead of having a forcelimit of 68 regiments, I could limit their forced to, say, 35 regiments, that I could easily beat. Another element could be the confiscation of naval assets. An example could be Great Britain confiscating France's heavy ship fleet in order to prevent them properly challenging the Royal Navy ever again. Of course, these limits could not be indefinite. This would mean that Poland or France, in my examples, would never be able to effectively wage a war ever again or defend itself if attacked. 

What do you guys think of this? How difficult do you think it would be to implement? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would someone like to explain what attracts one to NASCAR?

In my head, there is no variance in the track and there is little apparent competition for the drivers. I completely accept that it is damn good fun to drive it, but I don't see how it would be exciting to watch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If he played dumb on the IQ test, why did he go to prison for 5 years? By refusing to be drafted he missed out on his boxing prime.

As for his practices through Islam, those practices are perfectly acceptable within it. He converted to Islam because that was what he believed in.

On top of that, both he, Liston and Foreman were good friends. Why would they rig a fight like that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, that villain was plenty evil without needing to shoehorn in Apophis. Before now, he was dead. That was it. Done. Dusted. No more.

Why shoehorn him in now? We could have introduced a new villain and it all would have been fine.

This is almost as bad as when they backdoor-resurrected Clara in the most recent Doctor Who series. It was stupid and broke a perfect moment.

This is the same. They have backdoor-resurrected him, completely needlessly. Urgh. </TEXT>
