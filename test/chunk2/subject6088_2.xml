	<TITLE> A few things that would make this game more fun for me </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-04 04:14:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In no particular order, here are some ideas that don't change gameplay much but would make it more enjoyable for me (and, presumably, you too.)

 an "eye" icon/button to toggle on/off the HUD and all thought balloons and popups

 a halt-production option on buildings so you can stop growing it, permanently. 

 building swap -- when moving one building, if you hold it on top of another building for say, 2.5 seconds, it can swap locations of it has the same footprint. If not, nothing happens. 

 wider POV/zoom farther back when pinching/zooming

 ability to visit other cities outside of the marketplace. You ought to be able to bookmark a few cities without "becoming friends" with that mayor

 a true free market system where you can set any price for your items. If it's too expensive, people won't buy. But if it's rare enough or they're desperate enough, they will. To go along with this, all items should be neatly categorized and easily accessible or searchable. Remove the randomness of the marketplace that is easily the most frustrating aspect of the game. 

What are some other ideas you can think of? If we get enough good ideas, perhaps we can sticky it and make it more visible to EA devs

EDIT: 

adding some ideas from comments below:

 sending and accepting friend requests from in-game

 upgradable factories. Either faster production or perhaps more slots. 

 sellable buildings. You should be able to sell buildings you made or specializations you've purchased

 sellable Simoleons and sellable keys 

 a button to rotate the buildings.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-05-15 04:33:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I got a stretch of road that, for no apparent reason, needs an upgrade. I say no apparent reason because adjacent roads are less developed and are bearing the same load but aren't even yellow. 

It asked for a 6000 repair.. ($6k I don't have because I just upgraded my Vu Tower) so I thought I'd experiment on this stretch of road. 

http://imgur.com/QViXvv7

I opted to bulldoze it instead (got money back for it)

http://imgur.com/tAZrqnv


And when I built a fresh road, there was no traffic burden whatsoever.

So the solution seems to be -- at least for now -- bulldoze and rebuild. Get money back and have no more traffic burden.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So after the most recent update, upgrade forecasts were bleak. Nearly all homes were yellow instead of orange. 

But I think I managed to make them all orange again. 

I bulldozed sectioned of road that isolated all the electrical plants (I have two fusion plants I use for power and I recently added a nuclear plant just because I like the way it looks.)

After restoring the roads, I think it made ally yellow houses orange again.

	<TEXT> I had a helipad and then immediately added an airship hangar. Then I saw blimps flying around but never choppers. Then recently I added a ballon park and now I see hot air balloons but no blimps and no choppers.

Is this true for everyone else; only ever one aircraft animation in your cities?

EDIT: I've finally seen both together!

	<TEXT> [VIDEO TUT](https://youtu.be/A7ocqbxXisc)

Here's how to get inside Fleeca Bank. It's an old glitch that was patched but works again now.

TEXT TUT:

1) Get on the roof of the Fleeca Bank across the street from the LSC near Sandy Shores. Use a tall vehicle to climb up.

2) Stand near the peak of the roof.

3) start a contact mission from your phone -- it can't be one of the new Martin Adversary mode missions. Choose one of the other normal missions.

4) once you are in the settings menu, you can quit. (If you've chosen an Adversary Mode mission, you will teleport to the location of that mission when you back out of the menu.)

5) this should spawn you inside Fleeca Bank.

This glitch also works at other restricted buildings. I can make more videos if this is popular.

	<TEXT> If you managed to get the DoD into online but can't get it into your garage because it won't let you teleport, here's how to get around that...

 break off the passenger door of the DoD by getting in from the passenger side and immediately reversing. Crash into something and break off the door. 

 now drive over to your garage and park it parallel with your garage door with your driver's side pressed up against the garage door. Make sure you leave enough space next to it to bring over a street car that you can shoot and set on fire. 

 now do the fire glitch and when you jump out of the street car (when you would normally teleport) jump in the passenger door of the DoD. 

If you timed it right, it will work. 

(This won't work unless you transferred your character from Old Gen console.) </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-03-04 18:57:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, quick question:

Do you think it's worth getting the nano factory? I'm population 152k, level 24. 

This is my second go-around as my last city progress got lost in a Game Center snafu. But I've concentrated on getting the Fusion Reactor because I was so close to it last time before I lost my city. 

So I have all education buildings and a Fusion Reactor but my factories are weak. 

I have 4x high tech factories, 2x basic factories (3-slot factory) and a small factory (2-slot.)

I can get another factory right now but I don't know if a clean, pollution free nano factory is worth the extra price. 

Should that be something I worry about later on or bite the bullet now? How vital is the nano factory for your future city planning? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems that the new glitch where you can duplicate the garages from one character to the next is real.

People are really able to do it. But you have to be duping cars from the character on the RIGHT of the character selection screen to the garages of a new character on the LEFT of the screen.

Many people have their 'main' character on the left and therefore cannot accomplish this glitch.

Our job is to figure out a way to swap the characters so we can do the glitch.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When someone challenges me to a one-on-one deathmatch in freeroam, i'm always hesitant to accept the challenge because everyone else in the lobby disappear off your radar once you've accepted.

I don't understand why it's necessary to have everyone else in the world disappear if they're still able to interact with you (read: kill you) while you're in the deathmatch.

Either allow others to still show up on your radar (and emphasize your deathmatch partner by showing them as red -- as they already do -- or a different, specific color or icon) or make it so no one else can kill you while you're in a deathmatch (like they can't when you've entered a Gang Attack.)

	<TEXT> Seeing as how the whole country just wants to knock down the Patriots, I figure 49er fans are about the only people that are as happy about last night's SB win as Pats fans are.

Brady is still a hometown hero to us Bay Area folks. Born and raised locally and a self-professed Montana fanboy, the only thing that reminds us he's not still one of us is the logo on the side of his helmet. 

He played like a genuine legend and I was honored to be able to see him make history. Good on him and congrats to all of you. 

Seeing Richard Sherman eat crow and and the whole Cheathawks team implode made it 1000x sweeter. We've been on the short end of that stick too many times these past years. So thanks for that extra cherry on top. 

Serious congratulations to you guys. Don't get too drunk but I'll have one on you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm always accidentally picking up handguns and submachine guns from NPC.

It would be cool if we could sell it to Ammunation for 10 cents on the dollar against their retail price.

It would also be a good way to get rid of weapons you no longer want. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> This is Greg Roman... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-02 01:53:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I never really looked into this before, but according to Roman's wikipedia page, this is his experience as an offensive coordinator:

* **1995-2001 Offensive Line ASSISTANT** (Carolina Panthers 46-66 in that span, ending 1-15 in 2001)

* **2002-2005 Tight ends/quarterback coach** (Houton Texans 18-46 in that span -- 3 of 4 seasons finished sub 5-wins.)

* **2006-2007 Offensive Line Assistant** (Baltimore Ravens 18-14 in that span. Offensive coordinator, Jim Fassel fired in 2006. HC, Brian Billick fired in 2007.)

* **2008 Offensive Coordinator** (Holy Spirit High School, Absecon, New Jersey. HSHS Varsity football was undefeated in 2007 and won a state championship. in 2008, they went 7-3 and missed the championship. They won championships in 2010, 2011, 2012.)

* **2009-2010 Offensive Coordinator** * (Stanford University -- Sun Bowl loss; 20-6 record overall in that span. Harbaugh was 29-21 in the four years he was HC at Stanford.)

* **2011-present Offensive Coordinator** (San Francisco 49ers)

*Roman's wiki says he was offensive coordinator for Stanford 2009-2010 but the Stanford Football wiki lists David Shaw under their mulit-coordinators scheme.


This guy was basically a high school offensive coodinator who missed the championship and ended up part of a mulit-coordinator staff at Stanford there they had a two-time Heisman runner-up quarterback (Andrew Luck) lighting things up for him.

By this brief research, Greg Roman seems to be someone who sort of slipped through the cracks and just got lucky because he knew the right people. With this many weapons on offense, I don't see how a team can potentially finish .500 (or worse.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In this mysterious scene, a woman takes off Saul's glasses and sets them on a table. She dabs his face with a wet towel twice. 

http://imgur.com/MVfFbpH

Meanwhile, a guard moves toward the glasses/table. Does he grab it or tamper with it? It's not clear. 
The scene then cuts to the guards removing Saul from the room. It's sort of an abrupt cut. Passage of time is implied. 

Who was the woman?

What was she doing? Did she/they do something to Saul's glasses?

I wonder this because

1) during the prisoner exchange, Carrie helps Saul get to his feet and she conspicuously (to us, the audience) picks up his glasses and puts them in her pocket. 

2) AND THEN right before RPGs fire at their convoy, Saul puts on the glasses before answering the phone. Then Boom!!

Any theories? Is it symbolic? Is it significant?

Who is the girl? What were they doing? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-11-07 19:02:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **SF @ NO (L) 13-21** (NO at home is beast. hard to beat.)

**SF @ NYG (W) 17-13** (our yards per game are 345.6 to their 345.9. But our defense holds up and Phil Dawesome wins for us.)

**SF v WAS (W) 21-10** (Their weak run game versus our stout fun defense = a lot of 3-and-outs for the Skins.)

**SF v SEA (L) 13-28** (I hate myself for this. Seattle never wins when they play us at home. I feel like we'll have a few crucial penalties and one too many turnovers that Seattle is really good at capitalizing on.)

**SF @ OAK (W) 17-6** (Because Raiders.)

**SF @ SEA (L) 14-17** (Seattle at home.)

**SF V SD (W) 24-21** (We find our groove and San Diego is running out of steam.)

**SF v ARI (W) 24-21** (I think the Cards are a fraud. I think they'll tank and be 9-6 or 10-5 going into week 16. and we'll beat them at home.)

So we finish 9-7 and probably don't get a wildcard.

I hope I'm wrong. What do you guys think?

	<TITLE> Legit question: as far a offensive play calls, where does the buck stop? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-03 23:39:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's not clear to me (or to the media or to fans,...) when it comes to Niners offensive play calls, who is making the calls? Is it Roman? Or is Harbaugh running ideas to Roman? Or is Roman making suggestions to Harbaugh? Or is Roman making the calls and Harbaugh accepts or vetoes them? Or what?

This is a legitimate question because I think it's completely unacceptable that the Niners basically made like 14 rushing attempts and several of those were designed for Kaep. 

And don't get me started on the let's-pass-to-Crabtree-in-the-end-zone-during-critical-redzone-situations playbook that the Niners keep going to. 

So my question is, who is responsible for these play calls? </TEXT>
