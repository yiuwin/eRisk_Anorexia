	<TEXT> **It is not our purpose to become each other; it is to recognize each other, to learn to see the other and honor him for what he is.**


Hermann Hesse

What this quotes means to me: For me, this quote means that my sobriety and my goals in life cannot be to "become" someone else. I don't want her body. I don't want her sobriety. I don't want to become "more like her."

I can accept and love the things in others, without being jealous or wanting them for myself. You are you, and I am me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Everything Ive ever let go of has claw marks on it.*

David Foster Wallace

What this means to me: I always thought I lived hard. Partied hard. Was intense. I prided myself on being a "classic scorpio" who loved hard and fast and grabbed onto things with full rigor and never let go.

In recovery I am learning about patience, about being kind, and handling myself and others with compassion and gentleness. </TEXT>

**What this quote means to me is that when I treat myself as if I am my inner child, I treat myself with kindness, love and compassion. I see her mistakes and faults are things to be improved on, as lessons to be learned. When I treat myself like I am healing my inner child, I am happier** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got my IUD (Mirena) removed on November 6th 2015. Thought I had AF, but turns out it was probably just from the IUD removal. DH and I have been really excited to start a family and were disappointed when we didn't get a BFP.

We've been through a really stressful year: I moved away to go to school and he's been working to support us both. I moved home on December 4th and have felt a lot less stressed. 

On December 15th I went to the doctor and she did some bloodwork. The next day she called me saying I had very very low iron levels. She recommended a supplement and I've been taking 600mg ferrous gluconate since then.

This Monday I knew something was going on with my hormones: I felt completely overwhelmed and was crying at everything...nipples were huge, breasts were sore. Classic "Period of BFP?"

Last night I finally got AF! I came out of the gym bathroom fist pumping the air and DH says: "Ah the period dance, congratulations"

So ladies...almost two months after my IUD removal and it looks like things are ready to go. I am so excited!!!!! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello and welcome,

Myself, the mods and the members here would like to welcome you to /r/stopdrinking. 

I imagine you might not be at the best place in your life right now. I imagine that some of you want to stop forever, whereas some of you might be contemplating whether or not you can make it through the next hour.

The truth is: there is no one way.

What we offer you here on SD is support. The moderators and members here are committed to providing a safe place for you to vent and be heard. The sidebar contains all the history of SD, a survey, wisdom, books, videos, music, comics, Saturday Shares and Sunday Solutions. A lot, eh?

If you're looking for advice: you might get it more as a byproduct of people speaking from their experience. We don't give advice here: we speak from the "I"

What the hell is that?

Speaking from the I is therapy talk for speaking from your experience. The theory is: I have no idea who you are, what your circumstances are. You are the expert on your life. The most helpful thing I can do with this limited knowledge of you is to share what worked for me.

Advice-giving is really easy. Speaking from the I? Not so easy. It requires owning what I am saying, reflecting on how I have handled situations in the past and it requires me to actually THINK and not just hurl some generic answer at you!

Welcome. We get a lot of people here around this time. This subreddit is a key component of my recovery. I use it everyday. Many others can attest to the power of this place. I hope you find what you're looking for!!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In AA circles, I believed that everyone in the world drank like alcoholics. I was surrounded by problem drinkers, so my world consisted of problem drinkers...not regular drinkers. 

In my circle of "regular" drinkers, there is no alcoholic drinking. People don't get wasted at 10am and skip work. They don't finish their beers.

**Being involved in both communities of people has been extremely rewarding. I love my sober people and I love my non-problem drinking friends. What I need to be aware of though is that I am a bit of a chameleon: I blend in. Humans tend to become part of the tapestry in groups, and they have similar patterns and mannerisms. I need to remember that I AM a problem-drinker, I do not react favourably to alcohol.**

I just realized this: I occupy both worlds and love both, but I can see how easy it would be to TRY moderate drinking if I wasn't FIRM in my sobriety. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't been to an AA meeting in quite some time. I used to go everyday for the first year and a bit of my recovery. Many of the ideas in the program helped me, but today I was struck by a message in modmail about a fellow mod /u/finally_woken and I thought I would share.

I came: I remember walking into the doors of AA and inpatient exhausted and ready for something...anything. I showed up.

I came to: I started waking up...I can't really describe it, but it was like the world started opening up. I started to see things for the first time again. I remember laughing for the first time, a real belly laugh, about 2 weeks into my rehab program. We were walking to an AA meeting in the community and I just laughed. I will forever remember that laugh. 

Coming to believe: in myself, in trusting someone else to help me, coming to believe that I could recover...that my life could get better.

Now I stand in the light. I came, I came to, and I came to believe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My name is Victoria. I am a mod of SD. I have been for a very long time.

I am a human being. I just wanted to introduce myself.

I have good days, bad days. I am a wife, a friend, a sister, a recovering person, a student. I wear a lot of hats.

My SD mod hat is one I wear with pride. Yeah, pride. I am proud of this place. I love it here. It is my home. When people fuck with my home, I get upset. Because that's how the human mind works: when something close to us is threatened, we react. It's a survival thing. Behind the anger is a lot of things: frustration (Why are people behaving like this? Don't they understand we are trying our best?), sadness (they must be really sick, that is sad), confusion (Why is this happening? I thought this place was safe and free from hatred?) or having unrealistic expectations (recovery is peachy and everyone is happy and free).

So please. Remember. Each username has an ENTIRE HUMAN BEING behind there. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 4 Years Sober </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-27 22:22:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> May 27th 2011 was my last drunk.

Let's set the stage first...I was a daily drinker. All day everyday. I lived at my parents house, drank in the woods and my entire being was addicted to alcohol (physically and mentally).

I spent the month of May in 2011 half sober. Which was a bit of a miracle for me. In early May, I got very very drunk and my parents burst into my room and drove me to detox in Kingston because the local Ottawa detox was full.

I spent some time there and then went to my aunts cottage. Middle of nowhere. Booze hidden in the shed. Didn't drink. I got home and was sober for almost 2 weeks. My parents decided to let me to go to ex's house in Montreal for the long weekend.


I got there and immediately bought a bottle of vodka and spent the entire weekend blacked out. I have almost no memories.

I got home and got the call, I was going to rehab on June 1st.

So it was on the fateful day of May 27th, 2011, that I had my last drink. And a drink for me back then was a 1.5 liter of wine (the big ones.)

I remember telling my parents I was going out for a run. Everyone knew what that meant.

I drank in the woods and cried. All I wanted was to be watching a movie with my family. But I wanted to drink too. I was so sad and confused. I didn't understand I was an alcoholic. I didn't know what was wrong with me.

Four years later. I am living in Toronto and studying to become an addictions counselor. Halfway there, actually. I got married on July 26th 2014 to my best friend. He supports me and loves me unconditionally. I have my family back. My sister calls me to say hello. 

I smile, laugh, play, take care of myself and have nice things. I don't hurt myself anymore. I don't hate myself anymore. My self talk is friendlier than it's ever been.

I don't believe in the comment, "If I can do it, anyone can." That's bullshit. You can do it, IF YOU WORK FOR IT.

I realized that my family traditions probably started by someone simply saying, "we're going to start doing this every year."

So I started making our family traditions.

In the fall, we go apple picking. Then I make apple pie.

The last three years, my husband and I have had the 23rd of December as our family Christmas day. We exchange one gift and open our stockings. Our bunny also gets some gifts.

We celebrate with ginger ale and I put frozen blueberries in them. It's kind of festive and exciting.

I am responsible for what I do to others and for what I allow others to do to me.

I am responsible for my wants and desires.
 
 
All of me, every aspect of my being, is important. I count for something. I matter. My feelings can be trusted. My thinking is appropriate. I value my wants and needs. I do not deserve and will not tolerate abuse or constant mistreatment. I have rights, and it is my responsibility to assert these rights. The decisions I make and the way I conduct myself will reflect my high self-esteem. My decisions will take into account my responsibilities to myself.

Recovery is hard work. So be better. Just because it seems like a cut and dry, "do this" response, be better. Speak from your experience. Tell us a story why it worked for you.

You're not skirting the topic by not directly answering someone's plea for advice. You're fleshing out your personal experience.

We are not stupid. We know how to turn "I did this in your situation" to "Maybe I should do that and see how it works..."

Let's foster an environment that stirs ideas in someone else's mind, rather than firmly trying to implant YOUR way into their mind.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It was Friday evening. My sister was home from British Columbia to visit. I will later learn my parents had asked her to come back so she could say her last goodbyes. No one had much faith I was going to last if I get kept drinking.

It was May 27th 2011.

On the Wednesday of that week, I received a phone call stating I was to begin inpatient rehab on June 1st. I was nervous, scared, excited, relieved, terrified. My parents and I were discussing whether or not I'd be sober going there. They were babysitting me at the time. I was sneaking around them, drinking vodka at all hours of the day.

I was sober that week, only because I had a three-day blackout from the Victoria Day weekend. 

I had a craving. Back then, my cravings were like needing air. I had zero desire to say no. This time was a little different. This time, I didn't want to drink. I really, really did not want to.

I went for my usual "I'm going for a run, be back in a bit." My dad gave me a big hug and said, "Please be safe." I grunted...knowing we both knew what was going to happen. I said a sad goodbye to my family. My sister couldn't look me in the eyes and my mother just looked sad.

I went to the grocery store, and looked in my bank account. I had 20.16 to my name. Enough to take out a 20 dollar bill and buy a bottle. I didn't like spending money directly from my debit, because my dad saw all my transactions and I didn't want "Wine Store" to be on there.

I remember being so upset that I had enough to drink. I was so mad. If I had bought anything else, I'd MAYBE not be able to drink.

So I bought my 1.5 liters of white wine. Chugged half in the woods. Crying my eyes out. So utterly sad. I just wanted to be watching a movie with my family eating popcorn.

I was abusive to my mother that night. I broke my DSLR camera. I woke up sore and in withdrawal. That was my last night drinking.

I went to rehab for 35 days. Then outpatient. AA twice a day. I took my medicines on time. 

Here I am today. I have a loving husband, a little pet rabbit named Billy, a home, I am going back to school and planning on becoming a mother very soon.

Sobriety is worth it! </TEXT>

We got married in Ottawa, Canada on July 26th 2014. Our wedding was at St. Stephen's Anglican Church and our reception was at the Aviation and Space Museum.

Our total budget was around 27,000 dollars (not including our honeymoon). We had 140 guests show out of 180 invited.

I had a blast. I was so fucking nervous before walking down the aisle, I was shaking the whole time. My advice: EAT and make sure you drink enough water to stay hydrated.

	<TEXT> Because they just had a major shift in one of their policies that directly affects you.

If you have a registry with them and picked your gift items ONLINE or in a different store than the one that's designated your "pick up store" this applies to you.

I picked all my stuff online. Because I thought that's what you're supposed to do.

The Bay no longer does store to store transfers. This means that if your gift item was purchased online, but is not available at your store for pickup, you will get a gift card.

This happened to me, and they said, "well use your gift card to purchase what you really wanted online, or find another store."

Well, that's not really the point of a gift registry.

	<TEXT> Holy cow.

Well, recovery is possible.

I'm not even sure how to be eloquent about how my recovery has changed and morphed. But it really, really has.

I was an all-day vodka drinker by the end, contemplating prostitution and suicide. I went through withdrawal numerous times and it wasn't enough to keep me away. A drink solved everything.

Three years ago on May 27th 2011 I was living at my parent's house while waiting to go to rehab. I went to rehab on June 1st 2011.

I didn't want to drink. But I HAD TO. But something was different this time. When I left for my usual, "I'm going...for...a...jog" lie, my parents and sister knew what I was really going to do. And I really didn't want to. I remember just wanting, so badly, to sit with them and watch a movie before I went to rehab.

I had 20.16 in my account, so I took out 20 dollars, bought a giant bottle of wine and drank it in the woods. I cried. That night I was verbally abusive to my mother.

I have not had a drink since. Not because of shame, not because I didn't want to go back there. I really cannot tell you WHY I stopped picking up. 

The first time I admitted I was an alcoholic was June 1st 2011, when I was asked if I believed I was an alcoholic. I said, "I guess, I mean, I'm in rehab."

Those 35 days really helped me. I felt at home with other addicts. These were definitely my people. I fucking hated AA, but I grew to like it. It's a process.

These days I am planning a giant wedding, marrying a great man, have friends, have a job, and have some sanity. 

It's totally fucking worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yesterday my future in laws threw me a bridal shower. I was insanely humbled and grateful for this. I had a bridal chair, everyone made a huge effort and I felt so honoured. Everyone really loves my fiance, and they are so happy he found someone to spend the rest of his life with.

After opening presents, I was told I needed to give a speech. I upset my mother, and she was crying in the bathroom. I think she was overwhelmed at the prospect of 'losing' her daughter to this 'new' family.

I never realized how intense getting married is, for everyone involved. My mother felt sad and happy that I am marrying into such a fantastically generous family. She feels like she "let my sister and I down."

I don't really have words to explain to my mother and father how much their support and love has helped me in the past three years of sobriety. I can't even imagine my life without them.

Today, I feel so tired and overwhelmed. Anyways, just wanted to share. I dunno if this will help anyone. </TEXT>

This was my fault, I believe. I thought it was printed automatically, and the proof doesn't have "thank you" written on it either. 

Anyways, bridal brain fart, I laughed it off and decided to email them and see what they could do.

In a few hours, I was told that they had gone into my account, **reordered my thank you cards, with thank you written on them, at ZERO charge**

	<TEXT> Alright. **Fiance is 37, not 27, made a mistake in title**

So, I got engaged to an amazing man almost a year ago and we're getting married in July. I will or have become an aunt to a 10 year old, 8 year old and 5 year old. My fiance's oldest sister and him are quite close, and she is one of the bridesmaids at our wedding.

We fucked up. We're so tired, that we don't make family gatherings, we don't make a big effort for birthdays and stuff, and lately we made a big mistake.

My Future SIL's father-in-law died suddenly last weekend, and the funeral was on Friday morning. We both have full time jobs, and I have missed quite a bit of work and JUST got a promotion. My future Mother in law told us not to make the 6 hour car ride for the funeral, and my fiance has taken quite a bit of time off work.

That's the logical side of why we missed the funeral. I probably could have gotten the day off, but I've missed so many days the past 3 months and had many shifts covered. I know my bosses would have understood, but there's quite a bit of tension there.

So my fiance called his sister tonight, and she is flaming mad we didn't go to the funeral. Like, "I can't talk to you right now."

I just wrote an email to her (I will call tomorrow, she probably doesn't want to talk again tonight) apologizing and probably saying the wrong things. The truth is, I've never been in this situation before of having two families, of being an aunt, etc. 

Where do we go from here? How badly did I mess things up?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1000 days ago, give or take a few hours, I was chugging wine in the forest behind my parent's house. I was scheduled to go to rehab in 5 days. I just couldn't stop myself from drinking that wine. I remember saying, "I just want to sit at home and watch a movie with my family." But here I was, crying in the woods, chugging wine.

Something happened after that day. I am so fortunate that the desire to drink was almost instantly taken from me. I really can't explain why. I went to rehab, learned everything I could, went to AA, outpatient therapy, and listened. 

The biggest thing that's changed and enabled me to stay sober for one more day is changing my attitude about life. I am an alcoholic. I did not choose to become one, but I am. Drinking isn't my problem, my thoughts and beliefs about life and my expectations are the issue.

Scrapping my massive sense of entitlement and letting go of what others think of me has been very important. I have experiences that everyone else does. It feels good. Other people's opinions of me are NONE of my business.

Anyways, work in progress. Thanks for being awesome out there. Have a sober 24! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm at a loss here. Who is setting up all the tables for you? 

We have 20 tables and the head table. We're making table cloths, napkins shaped in bunny ears, making placemats, we have centerpieces that have different steps involved in setting them up (books, vases with flowers, tied with gold lace).

We also only have 3 hours to set up before the reception starts. Can't go the night before or anything (it's in a museum).

HALP! Also, my florist offered but we can't afford her services (centerpieces at 50dollars a pop).

We're going to make everything...but how the shit does it all get set up? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Massive wedding on July 26th of this year. We have too many guests and my fiance isn't willing to compromise much, so I am finding ways to cut costs.

Save the Dates? Making a youtube video and sending it to the guests.

Invitations? Just the invitation, nothing else. People can RSVP on the website.

Website? Not paying for any service. Just using the one available on the Knot.

Other things I have done to save money is to nix the upgrade on our catering. It costed an extra 10 dollars per person for luxury linens, nicer silverware and plates and fancy cream and sugar jars on each table. I decided against this.

I want the space to look nice, so I am buying a shitload of organza material either online or in store and am going to wrap the back of the chairs and make bows. I have also decided to "hire" a friend of mine for the day-of-coordinating because she has fantastic style and wants more experience doing table settings etc etc.

My goal is to spend 26,000 on the wedding. The biggest expenses are catering and bartending: 14,000 for 190 guests. 3,000 for photography, and alcohol will be probably 1,000-1,500.

We have already spent around 6,000 dollars so far, have another 5,000 saved and are expecting to save a couple thousand a month (we have tennants, I waitress and my fiance tutors). I think we can do it but it's close.

	<TITLE> Me [28 F] with my Boss and Co-Workers[00 M/F] 3 months at the job, Getting teased and bullied </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-05 04:25:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello.

I started a job at a restaurant three months ago. I work full time hours there, and have worked at a restaurant before and know how to serve.

The majority of workers there are under 25 years, with the bosses (owners) over 30 years old. A wife and husband team own the place. 

Some backstory: I've had some issues with the full time bartender who is also a manager. She bullies me, bosses me around and has yelled at me infront of customers before. I talked to my female boss about it, and she said she had my back, that the girl was jealous because I threaten her job security. She said the plan was to become friendly with each other, so the bartender will lay off me and stop bullying me. She has, and I thought we were becoming friends or something (I am coming to the conclusion I am naive).

I'm a powerlifter/gym nut. I eat my oatmeal everday, I have visible muscle and get comments on my shape quite frequently from customers. I'm by no means a body builder, but I've got shapely arms, legs, ass the whole thing. 

Today I got called into the office and was given a talk. Word is, people feel uncomfortable working around me. My male boss told me "for such a small girl, you take up a lot of space. You walk around with your body puffed up like you own the place. People are scared of you. They call you Arnold and Hulk Hogan. You need to change, your job is in jeapardy."

I was honestly stunned. I think what he was trying to say is that sometimes I get thoughtless and don't yield to other workers (like at the coffee station etc). But he brought up all this teasing that is going on and I don't know how to move forward. Everyone is so friendly to me. I'm actually a nice person, I try to make small talk and be chummy and fun.

How do I move forward? I was really upset when my boss was speaking to me, because he kept bringing up all the shit people say behind my back.



---   
**tl;dr**: Getting teased behind my back because of my shape/demeanour at work. Not sure how much I am able to change and am looking for feedback. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Inspiration] First Unofficial Powerlifting Competition: results and insights. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-01 04:30:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am 28/f/139lbs. I've been lifting for around 1 year 2 months and training for powerlifting for 6 months.

I have previously written about my programming and everything. I ran Korte's 3x3, then 5-3-1 twice. 

Lift progression

Bench: 75lbs to 115lbs after Korte's 3x3 and 5-3-1. I hurt my shoulder in March and it's really been a huge setback to my bench.

Squat: 45 lbs in September 2012. My max squat was 215lbs. Still working on it. My squat is so dependent on my food intake from the day before and day of, and sometimes I just don't eat enough so I struggle.

Deadlift: 45 lbs in September 2012 to 235lbs. For the first six months, I was training with someone who didn't teach me to deadlift the way I currently do. My max in January 2013 was maybe 160. I learned proper deadlift form for powerlifting in April 2013 and along with a lot of leg work, we got my deadlift up to a great number.

Accessory work for my deadlift was key. I have strong legs and never have issues breaking the bar from the floor, but the rest is hell for me. We did banded rack pulls (bands added another 50-60lbs of resistance per side) and basically practiced grinding out the top and smashing my hips forward.

I didn't hit many great lifts today, but I was thrilled with actually competing. I am actually a powerlifter now.

Squat, attempt 1: 155 (make) attempt 2: 175 (make) attempt 3: 205 (didn't make, so close though)

Bench, attempt 1: 75 (make), attempt 2: 95 (make), attempt 3: 110 (make). Hindsight, should have shot for 120.

Deadlift, attempt 1: 175 (make), attempt 2: 200 (make), attempt 3: 235 (make).

I didn't place. The women I lift with are all beasts. We all deadlifted at least over 200 pounds and squatted over 175. Highest female deadlift number: 340lbs.

The guys were just silly. PR deadlift 600 lbs, guy weighs 190. 

Keep lifting. And unsanctioned events are fun as hell. Here's some photos for anyone interested. [Photos](http://imgur.com/a/ac2Lv) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two events today that made me so grateful I am sober. I work at a diner and occasionally people come in for a beer. 

Event 1:
- guy comes in at 530pm. Orders 4 standard drinks in 45 minutes. Not even sure if that's legal. Stumbled out. SO glad I am not him.

Event 2 broke my heart. My co-worker was telling me about Monday night. I guess after we closed, there were still people in the restaurant. So at around 940pm (10 minutes after we closed) a woman stumbled out of a cab into the restaurant and wanted to order a beer. She was extremely drunk and wearing her PJ's. My co-worker said, "How sad is that?" and I remembered being that woman. So drunk, so desperate. She was supposedly very upset we couldn't serve her.

I'm so happy to be in recovery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, as many of you might know, I am currently planning a wedding and trying to get into grad school. I am also trying to become financially independent from my parents. They have supported me financially since FOREVER, and I owe them financial amends to the tune of thousands.

Last week I was thinking that finally, I could become free from needing their help with the wedding. They have done enough, given enough. But I was left wondering, "If I ever really needed cash, and my fiance was strapped, we could still ask my parents."

That was holding me back.

Then on Wednesday, my dad was laid off from his career. Severance package is amazing, but my parents are now fighting for their retirement.

Freedom. I've decided this is the time. I told my parents we no longer needed any money for the wedding, that they were no required to get us gifts, because their unwavering support since I got sober is enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are three things I have been lacking.

My fiance and I had a big talk last night that he was expecting. Supposedly this past month, I've been very quiet about my emotions, I've been angry and frustrated and I've been running away from issues.

He told me it was a matter of time that I started to talk about it. So we did.

Fear and avoidance are my vices. I go to them when I am faced with much of reality. The LSAT's were infringing on the level of my intelligence, and at the same time were feeding a fear that alcohol and an eating disorder had destroyed some of my capabilities. So, I avoid. I don't only avoid, I then create rationalizations of why I no longer need to write. I went through this cycle over and over again. 

Alcohol and food were merely substances that helped me get to my level of avoidance. But the recourse was high. Now, facing life head on is something I struggle with. I've made progress. I don't leave bills unattended, I am planning the wedding and dealing with setbacks and budget issues, I keep plans, I am reliable. But the fear these days, I'm looking at it now through my mind's eye, and going, "WOW, the amount of shit I am willing to put up with from myself is nuts. I'd never let someone else treat me like this."

So today I am being brave. Acting with courage. Living in faith. I'm okay. No conditions necessary. I am ok.  </TEXT>

So, we've decided to do the Saturday Shares a little differently.

Basically, every Saturday, if you feel like doing a Saturday Share, the post will get "stickie'd". Free for all. I will post them in the sidebar and they will go with the rest of the archive.

I'm doing it this way because I've had issues with people committing to their date, and the "message the next person" seemed to only be partially effective. I've also messaged people the night before, but let's be honest, we're all adults and we can keep appointments we've committed to :)

So share your story! Or don't, you know...it's all in your hands now :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The easy course for me right now would be to get a mediocre job, and after the wedding next summer, start having kids and put the financial responsibility on my fiance.

The hard course is going back to school. Choosing a university, a program. Probably waiting another few years before we have kids, sacrificing some of my sanity for long hours studying and working.

I am choosing the hard course. But I am so fucking scared of "failing". The LSAT is coming up soon, I'm not as ready as I want to be (ha! ok, I need to let this go).

So here I sit, studying. Going back and forth between my meditation book, my LSAT preptests, dark chocolate and self-soothing techniques.

This is hard. Just wanted to share. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello there,

Thought I'd share my lifting progress from May 27th-July 19th.

First my stats

* 135 lbs, 5"6, Female, 27 
* Goals: Powerlifting meet November 16th. Want to hit 135 lbs for bench, 225-235 squat and 260-270 deadlift.
* Diet is gluten free. High protein (150-200 grams a day) on training days and on off days. I do cardio everday, at least an hour on stairs or something. I eat 2000-3000 calories a day depending on energy expenditure. All sorts of meats, protein drinks, quinoa. Um, yeah my diet is pretty much all vegetables, meats, protein powder, quinoa and fudge. There's really no method to the madness, just make sure I eat enough and then some. 


We ran an 8 week program, Korte's 3x3. Phase one is 4 weeks of volume training. Training the big three, three days a week, six sets of six reps. Brutal.

Next phase, testing 1 rep max. Once again, squats, deadlifts and bench three days a week. For deadlift and squat, we ran 3x3 on days we weren't hitting a max, but for bench we did 5 sets of 4.

The last week, you'll notice, I was fucking toast so we didn't hit anything major.

After July 19th, we did three weeks of assistance work. Squats, deadlifts and bench every week, but mainly assistance work. Close grip bench, OHP, ground benching, pushups, some ab work, deficit deadlifts, RDL's, pause benching, lots of variety of squats...

Now we're running 5-3-1, working out 4 days a week. Doing a big lift everyday (OHP, Deadlift, Squat and Bench) but won't be hitting an 1rpm until September. Then it's beast mode until November 16th.

	<DATE> 2013-08-22 02:46:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before I quit drinking, I was completely erratic and insane when under the influence. I lived in Montreal and my sister experienced the hell of my drinking years before I quit. She was traumatized by my behaviour. 

Before I got sober, I was living at home in Ottawa and my sister came to visit me from Vancouver. I think my parents believed those were going to our last days together. I was close to drinking myself to death.

Long story. This weekend, my sister's boyfriend's brother (a friend of mine) is having a bachelor(ette) weekend in Montreal. I was invited and planned on going. This week, my sister was reminding me of how much drinking there would be. I realized that this had nothing to do with me, and that we hadn't set any boundaries about us "partying" together when I am sober.

We decided not to go to the party. I am bummed. I was pretty excited to see old friends and celebrate. But my sister won't have fun with me there. And she's a star of the show there, an important player in the weekend. 

Consequences, years after. This is such a huge reminder of how serious my drinking affected my family. </TEXT>

And I am happy it's going well. I'm totally out of my comfort zone. Tomorrow our day is completely unplanned. It's very strange. As long as we eat and sleep somewhere, day went well.

I'm just here to check in and share how great long term sobriety is. It's pretty incredible what we're capable of. Do the work. It's worth it.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In rehab, I was told to protect my sobriety. One of the ways to do this was to close all the back doors that could help me go back out. Back doors are people that would enable you, if you ever decided to start using or drinking again. 

For me closing the back door meant telling people that I was an alcoholic. My first apartment out of rehab, I shared with my roommmate and told her within the first week that I was an alcoholic. If I had not told her, I could have set myself up for drinking. And this is how my brain works when it comes to alcohol: scheme, scheme, scheme.

This is uncomfortable. It's weird. And in my first year I was adamant about telling people. I bet I created a lot of awkwardness around me sometimes. But it fucking worked.

I told my fiance, on our first date, that I was an alcoholic. My family has NO back doors open to my drinking, none. My close friends all know I am alcoholic.

I am safe. I feel protected. I have zero enablers in my life. I've created a world around me that requires me to be sober because it reflects my strong, strong commitment to sobriety. 

Close those back doors people.
