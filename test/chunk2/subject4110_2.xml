	<TEXT> I just felt like posting this encounter here for you guys and see what you think. Over the weekend my friends and I were in Lake Tahoe hanging out by the water relaxing. We were planning on camping but we met this kid who was there for some wort of business and he was staying in a hotel by himself. We ended up gambling and drinking that night so he offered to let us stay in his hotel room. We accepted the offer. In the middle of the night he woke us all up because of a man that was in the room. He said he saw the man standing there and initially thought it was one of my friends because of the height of the man. He described him as wearing a white (almost 50's) style suit and a fedora hat. He said the man stared at him for a few seconds and walked into the restroom. He said he could here someone taking a piss in the toilet. The only thing is... nobody ever ended up coming out. He was terrified to open the door and when we did there was nobody in there. In the morning we asked the front desk if they have ever had guests describe any hauntings. Turns out the hotel ended up already being known for its hauntings of which we had no idea when staying there. It was crazy, definitely a one of a kind experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my defense, my family is absolutely fucking nuts. I was forced to go camping, I didn't even smoke while I was there. They just assumed I was high because of how bored and sick of them I was.. I also only drank maybe 2-4 beers a day. I'm nearly graduated from college and have no substance abuse issues whatsoever. I just thought the whole your dad was addicted to the pot thing was hilarious. jahbless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yea man, not that psychologists and psychiatrists are a bad thing, I just think that trying to do it naturally is much better than having someone guess what is going on and just throw you on medication that turns you into a zombie and makes you not feel like yourself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel you need to face your fears head on and really find yourself on the inside to fix the different holes in your spirit that affect your daily life. 

I would really recommend Deepak Chopra - really give it a look. I feel this kind of stuff is the best for people suffering from conditions like yours. 

A friend of mine had a really had a rough childhood and had many horrible things happen to him that he still felt for many years. Recently he spent a month in India studying this practice and has really comeback as a newly strong, motivational, and free person.

Here's a website. If you have any questions at all I can have my friend answer them for you or put you guys in touch. He would love to talk to you. 

Good luck bro, stay up.
