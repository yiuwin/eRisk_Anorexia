	<TITLE> Are My Testicles Black? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask
over his mouth and nose.
A pretty, young, student nurse appears to give him a partial sponge
bath.
'Nurse', he mumbles, from behind the mask. 'Are my testicles black?'
Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, 'I don't know, Sir. I'm only
here to wash your upper body and feet.'
He struggles to ask again, 'Nurse, please check. Are my testicles
black?'
Concerned that he may elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from
worry about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and pulls
back the covers. She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand
and his testicles in the other.

Then, she takes a close look and says, 'There's nothing wrong with
them,
Sir!'

The man pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her and says very slowly:
'Thank you very much. That was wonderful, but, listen very, very
closely......

	<TEXT> I believe that it is your body's metabolism. In theory if you travel the speed of sound, time slows down. So the faster you go the slower time moves. When you are young, your metabolism is fast, so time seems to move slow and as you grow older your metabolism slows down so the reverse happens to time. Time feels like it is speeding up.
