	<TEXT> Thank you!! This message had made my day better. I'm ok- I do feel a bit better than I did last night. I still feel suicidal but I know I'm not going to act on it anytime soon. I am considering residential more...I think you're right, no one there will be judging me for my weight. Especially someone with an ED- at least I wouldn't because I've been on every end of the weight spectrum and I know how it feels. Again thanks!! :) </TEXT>
