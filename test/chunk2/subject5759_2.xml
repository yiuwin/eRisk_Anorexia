	<TITLE> Need some advice on a broken gas boiler and a huge gas bill that came with it </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-05-14 13:28:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys,

We're renting through an agency and have had a few problems with our boiler over the past few months. The landlord has been good and fixed it himself pretty quick when it's fully stopped working.

However this morning i get our quarterly gas bill, which normally is around 30 as everything but the kitchen tap is on electric hot water. This bill however is over 300.

Are we responsible for this bill? Or the landlord? 

Appreciate the help, </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've recently moved to the UK and since doing so I cannot change my apple ID location for purchases etc. 

When I try to change countries it mentions I have an outstanding balance in the old country and that needs to be settled before I can switch stores. The trouble is it also requires a payment method from the old country to pay off that outstanding balance. 

Since I now only have a UK credit card it doesn't let me pay for it or switch stores. I'm basically locked from downloading anything and apple wont let me give them money :( 

Any help or ideas appreciated :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I moved into London in November last year after traveling with a friend for some time. After being together for so long and then being crammed into tiny London hotel rooms we decided that instead of looking for work while living in a hotel we would get a short term rental.

Like you, we jumped on Gumtree and found an ideal 6 week short term place. We gave them a call, went around and looked at it. It was pretty bare but was going to serve it's purpose for not much more than we were paying for our tiny hotel room.

We moved in on a Wednesday, paid 6 weeks in advance and gave the place a huge clean before settling in. Come Saturday night however we get a knock on the door from 6 police officers asking us what the hell we're doing. We show them our short term agreement and they tell us the names on said agreement are not the owners or related to the owner in any way. They leave us be however because by that fact we are now squatting, which isn't a criminal matter but a civil one which means they don't handle it.

We then start to freak out and start having a nosey through some of the stuff they left around the place. Lucky for us the people who rented our place were completely retarded and left photocopied versions of their passports for us to find. We felt alot more at ease after that as some digging around online of their real names taught us that the house was their mothers and they had obviously just decided to make some money by renting it out while she was away. I called our "landlord" and he came what I thought was clean, telling us they just wanted to make some money for their Mum while she was away and they'd sort it all out for us. He assured us she wouldn't be back for 10-12 weeks so we won't have any more problems.

However a few days later we get a knock on the door and answer it to a nice looking middle aged lady who tells us this is her house and we need to talk. After a long chat it seems clear she was only away for a few days and after she has a look around she breaks down and explains her kids have stolen EVERYTHING from her house while she was gone.

She lets us stay there a little longer and on Christmas Eve we moved into a hostel before moving into a place (via a rental agency) just before NYE. We were lucky to get almost all the time we paid for and if the owner hadn't been so lovely we would've been completely screwed.

TL;DR - Don't rent private, got through an agency, sign real documents, ask for ID's </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your reply, I'll get the controls listed on the web player page at the very least. I've tried a few ways on making the boat a bit mote maneuverable at low speeds however nothing really felt right. I'll take another look at it sometime though as Ii agree it can be annoying.

Power ups, mario kart style is something I have been thinking about - not sure about in time trials but in group races it would be a great addition.

I've updated the web player to include a better camera setup :D

Definitely going to look into waves   currents :)

cheers!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been messing around with this boat time trial demo for awhile and I'm still not sure on it.

webplayer demo [HERE](http://digitalcake.co.nz/WaveMachinesTestDemo/index.html)

In it's current state you race a very fast boat around a few checkpoints to beat your fastest time. If I was to continue with the game I'd build in a ghost of your fastest lap and hook the fastest lap to an online scoreboard. Would also implement a basic map editor.

The thing is, I'm not sure it's that fun. I enjoy it as a long time trackmania fan but am not sure others would feel the same way.

Would appreciate people thoughts on the idea and demo </TEXT>

Is there any reason for this? Because to me it seems completely retarded.

	<TEXT> Hey guys, we've recently moved into a new house and are looking to get internet hooked up. From what I've found we need to actually have a full on phone line and plan to get internet via BT, and by the looks the phoneline itself costs the same as the internet...

We really have 0 use for a landline so we're looking for providers that don't require it (it was called 'naked broadband' back in NZ). Is that offered over here?

If not, really keen on suggestions for decent ISPs which are reasonably priced   if possible quick on the setup times.

Looking forward to all your advice.

	<TEXT> Actually that's Unity3d. Yes you can disable the default config screen in your game build or enable it only to appear when the user holds alt on start up. It's best to keep it in though, for those who have strange resolutions etc and have trouble getting in game to set it.

Within Unity you can setup quality levels and this developer only has one, which is fine. No matter how many levels you have this dropdown will still appear in the config window. No big deal and definitely not lazy, he's probably made at least 1 more game than you have </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not my parents, but a close family friend. I was around 13 and he said to me one afternoon.

"I'll give you $50 if you let me break 2 eggs on your head"

I jumped at the chance, agreed and just as I started to run to the kitchen he said "Are you completely sure you want to do this? Think about it while you get the eggs"

Of course the only thing I thought about while getting the eggs was the $50 he promised. I returned with the 2 eggs and we went outside.

He breaks one egg on my head, looks at me, then breaks the other in his hand.

I didn't like it much at the time, actually I was a wreck. But to this day i remember this lesson. Don't be blinded by money or rewards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have lots of transactions via paypal and we get our fair share of chargebacks. If you've got the right kind of paypal account (premier business) which you SHOULD be using if you're selling things online anyway then the dispute process is very good, in 3 years we've only had 1 chargeback that we did not win the dispute on.

My advice is as follows,

ALWAYS stress in the chargeback dispute that what they bought was a virtual product (paypal is very clear on refunds/reversals of virtual items being not covered). Make sure to mention the user already has used their product benefits and the product they paid for was delivered on 100%.

The only time we didn't get a win in the dispute is when the buyers account was closed for fraudulent activity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Noones going to write your code for you. It seems you've over promised here or bitten off more than you can chew. Nevertheless here is how I'd approach this.

Create an array of coordinates, each coordinate you enter would be an intersection of sorts. You the have an array like this for each path you'd like to take. It's then as simple as moving your camera to each one of these coordinates while using LookAt() to keep it facing the right direction.

If you come back here with some actual code, we can help debug it and make it better, but explaining what you want to happen and claiming google doesn't help won't get you far.

Best of luck dragonxeye! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you don't have much experience with PHP, and it sounds like you dont then using an MVC right away, or even building a full front facing website is probably not the best place to start. Building good code in the MVC pattern requires understanding of not only the particular MVC framework but also why the rules you're abiding by are important.

Some of the best advice I got some years ago was to simply build a project from the ground up in OO PHP. I learnt very well why the MVC pattern is important and moving into full MVCs and their way of doing things after that made alot of sense </TEXT>

If you do get a general meeting / interview / sit down with a label then being able to walk into the meeting and slap a track on the table that blows what they've already heard (and got you to the current point with them) out of the water then you're going to look amazing in their eyes.
