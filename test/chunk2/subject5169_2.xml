	<TEXT> I'm from Philly! Lovely city, I would love to give some advice just tell me what you're into. Partying, history, nature etc. If you get a Philly cheesesteak, don't go to Geno's or Pat's, they're pretty much only for tourists!

Also, I will vouch for New Orleans. Hands down my favorite American city to visit. Completely unlike anyplace in the world and impossible to have a bad time. Enjoy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair enough, this isn't acceptable at 18 much less 30 so I see you point there.

However, I'm just a little alarmed that we are quick to judge her character as a person based on 3 hours of her life where she was likely at her worst. She very well could be a horrible person, the point is we don't really know her character. Maybe by ending her ability to practice medicine, we are taking a potentially great doctor away from society. She could go on to save lives one day. A doctor is a very honorable profession, and just because she engaged in disgusting behavior while intoxicated doesn't necessarily mean she isn't capable of being a good doctor and member of society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not without sympathy. She is still in her youth, and we all have made some mistakes in our youth especially involving alcohol.

This behavior is completely unacceptable, and she deserves serious punishment, but if she can find a way to demonstrate through her actions she has learned from her mistakes I would hope there would be a path for her to perhaps get her career back on track which she has obviously worked very had to attain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> when you inevitably attempt suicide, you're alcoholic single mother will know it's just a cry for help and she will just skim your well thought out suicide letter. Actually, even if by some miracle you do have the balls to kill yourself, she's still just skimming that letter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could totally see that. On a related note, I volunteered for a PGA event a few years ago (before Spieth was on the tour) and I will say the one guy that went out of his way to talk to all kids and stay until everything was signed was actually Ricky Fowler. Before I assumed he was kinda a drama queen with his sort of 'loud' style, but a complete class act. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I visited Amsterdam for the first time last year. It was my first time ever outside of America.

The Dutch were just full of surprises. The first thing that struck me was the shyness of the Dutch. I am from Philadelphia which means I'm obnoxious and loud even by American standards. Striking up conversations with strangers you could tell was a really big deal for the locals. They were like surprised that you would even talk to them. However, once you began talking to them, they would be very direct and straightforward, like many here are saying. That was really unexpected given how shy they were. For example, we met these girls in a bar and started dancing, we went around and all busted a move (hey, we were drunk) and one of the girls we had just met was like "You're dance move was really feminine" which was hilariously insulting to me. I thought she was just some cute shy girl, I had no idea she was capable of this epic emasculating insult, lol. Love the Dutch! </TEXT>
