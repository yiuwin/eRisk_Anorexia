	<TEXT> Yeah I was trying to do one of the shrine quests where you make a snowball and cover a spot with its shadow. I stood too close to it with a fire weapon equiped and it melted the entire snowball. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't personally encoutered the lynel you speak of, but I shall go searching for him right now. I love lynel hunter. What I do is paraglide above them and rain arrows down on them. Land, mount and attack. When he bucks you off, they usually dont attack right away, so pull our your bow and shoot him in the face. Mount and attack again. Repeat until dead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually don't think I would have had much use for the hookshot in this game. With max stamina and climbing gear upgraded twice, I can move around very quick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most creative thing I've used it for is to find Lynels with shields. I was using a map with mini bosses marked on it and I'd just travel close while sensing savage lynel shields to hopefully get more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we'll probably need to create a new profile, or maybe they'll add a hard mode slot so we can have 1 save file for each. As for how they'll tweak it, I think probably just more enemies with higher hp, defense and attack. Can't really see what else they could do for a hard mode.

	<TEXT> That'd be too easy if that worked. I went for stamina until I had just under 2 and a half stamina wheels. Re allocated a few to get the master sword. Then found more shrines and got back what I had in stamina.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have read about lots of people having this issue and what I also read is that it the bug usually occurs when you have the game running for a long time. I haven't experienced it and I've left my system for over a week straight. I'm also on a wii u, not sure if that changes things or not.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lynel hunting </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I've seen a few ways of fighting lynels on here but I sorta made my own way and I find it to be the easiest way for myself and just wanted to share it. 
.
I start with paragliding close to then, using my best bow I fire as many arrows as I can before safely landing close to them. I mount and attack with my 101 attack savage lynel crusher, after getting bucked off I fire arrows at his face so I can mount him again. And just repeat until he's dead. I also have the barbarian set upgraded twice. Although I only use the charge attack if I know I have enough time. Usually beat them this way without taking much damage. 

What are your tips and tricks for killing lynels?  </TEXT>
