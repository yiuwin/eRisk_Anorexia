	<TEXT> The intelligence briefings at this point are probably the same information every day. He's not going to sit there and listen to the same thing every day just because that is customary for the president to do. If something urgent comes up then fine he will probably go to the meeting, but for now why does he need to go every day? Pence can fill him in with what happened and he can do president shit like working on the cabinet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not sure what you are trying to prove with these points.  Handguns cause more unjustifiable deaths than justfiable deaths from an opinion article in an extremely liberal newspaper?  People use handguns for home defense and invasions.  That is why people need handguns.  

Sniper rifle

What makes the Barrett different from any other rifle?  The caliber?  Are you complaining that the caliber bullet is too high?  It is a semi-automatic rifle with a pistol grip.  People use semi-automatic rifles with pistol grips to hunt deer and other big game, like the AR-15.

Owning a fully automatic weapon

Buying fully automatic weapons that were produced after 1986 are completely illegal to own.  If you want a fully automatic gun chances are you are buying a classic and undergo an extremely vigorous process.  Not only that but buying these are insanely expensive.  You are looking at $15,000 just for the gun then another ~$5,000 for the permits from the ATF.  Did you even read the article before you cited it?  How many deaths do you think have been caused by fully automatic weapons in America in the past 30 years? I would bet that it would be an extremely small number.

He wrote this in the past year after 22% of the coral reef suddenly died.  Now I am sure this is up to speculation, but there is very little chance that we can get large countries responsible for of of the greenhouse gase emissions to slow down.  Austrailia putting in another coal mine will have virtually no effect on the reef, unless there is some type of runoff that I am not aware of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a conservative voter, I can tell you that many of us would never consider voting democrat because of the gun argument. I have numerous friends who would have voted Bernie or another liberal if they weren't so anti-gun. Once that loosens up I think you will get a lot more people willing to cross party lines in the interest of the country, especially after this election. Some of the gun laws are so insane and they logically don't make any sense. In the northern states they ban "assault weapons" which to them is a strange definition. If you have a rifle that accepts magazines then you cannot have an adjustable stock.  Not sure how that makes a difference all it does is prevent you from shooting your gun comfortably at the range since you cannot adjust how close or far for the sight your shoulder sits. We need more open discussion about the laws. Most of us are obviously for sensible gun control. We don't think anyone and everyone needs a gun, however the left has taken it too far and their top agenda always seems to be to take our second amendment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you mean why do we believe wikileaks? Wikileaks isn't a news outlet. It's literally just releasing the sources of the information.  Why do you think the Clinton camp was trying to distract voters by saying Russia was hacking the DNC and they didn't talk about the emails being fabricated? 
I'm not sure what you mean about accusing boomers of not critically thinking. That sounds like a lot of anecdotal evidence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The presidency is not a joke, but you think that we should take every single word a politician says and believe or follow it?  You should be skeptical of EVERYTHING that people say regardless of who it is.  Blindly following what leaders say has gotten human civilization into trouble in the past.  Stop being a sheep and think for yourself.  Do not believe everything people say I don't care if its Trump, Obama, or the goddamn Pope.  

Please that healthcare bill was a train-wreck from the day it was conceived.  That was Obama's narcissism being bullied through congress.  He knew when it was being written that it was all bullshit and he still pushed it through.  Even the authors of the bill knew it was bullshit.  However, 'keeping your doctor and your plan' sounds a lot better than 'this is basically welfare for health insurance'  strangling the young, working class to give insurance to people who don't work.  

At the end of the day do not believe everything people tell you because, to quote Dr. House "everyone lies".  </TEXT>
