	<TITLE> Now I'm paranoid (trigger warning) </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay so this may sound incredibly dumb, but it keeps bothering me and its making me paranoid to go to any store in my town. 
A friend of mine whom works at our local Wal-Mart, had quite the incident today. She was using the bathroom and as she's sitting there a woman bursts in the stall next to her and v*'s quite violently, missing the toilet for the most part and it hits my friends shoes and pant legs in the process! Oh my god! That is like, one of my worst nightmares! She handled it like a pro and really was only upset at the fact that she just bought those shoes a couple days ago and now they're covered in a strangers vomit. 
But after hearing this, I am so paranoid to go to any store or anywhere really in my town for fear of exposing myself unknowingly or that type of scenario happening. 
Now, in my rational mind, I know that I'll be fine as long as I wash my hands, don't put my fingers in my mouth, etc. So then this all doesn't seem possible but then five minutes later I'm worrying about going to the store tomorrow and all of my anxiety and paranoia rushing back to me, knocking me off my feet and leaving me paralyzed in fear. 
Sorry if this seems irrational, I rarely have issues with stuff bothering me like this but this really bugs me for some reason. Maybe cause its a friend whom it happened to? I'm not sure. All I know is I'm thankful it wasn't me :(

	<TEXT> I've been with my fiance for 8 years now (we're both 23) and sex became an issue about two years ago. My Endo started progressing and the pain during sex was so unbearable. My sex drive also started to dwindle, but it wasn't completely gone by any means. 
He became concerned in the same ways you are, scared he wasn't attractive anymore, wondered if I was cheating oh him, etc. So, I had him come in and listen to what my gyno had to say. After that, he understood more and it was easier to work around things. 
Now, I love him more than anything, so it truly killed me when sex with the man I love felt like I was being stabbed over and over and I couldn't do it anymore. I would cry, but he'd comfort me. We eventually found OTHER ways to satisfy his (and mine if need be) needs, other than just having sex. There are seriously other things you can do to, sex isn't the only option. 
I agree with /u/stupidendobitch, there seem to be other things at play. Your fiance is very lucky to have you and that you're trying your hardest to understand this. I know a lot of girls don't have a guy that will stick this stuff out. But sit down with her and tell her this! Tell her exactly how you feel and ask her what you can do to help her, or understand what's going on with her a little better. Like these lovely ladies before me said, BC can be a bitch, hormones suck, and when you're in pain and sex hurts, its hard to want it at all or even feel sexy. She might be scared, I know I was a little. 
Best of luck to you both :) I hope things work out for the best.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry if this seems rude or anything for being off the topic of your question, but you're the first person I've come across with a thyroid disorder and Endo. I'm being tested for Hashis and Graves disease due to hyperthyroid symptoms, nodules, and a small (but uncomfortable) goiter. I've had Endo for almost 8 years now and thyroid problems for 1 year. How badly has your thyroid affected your Endo? I feel like mine has gone off the charts here as of late, along with my thyroid being out of whack, but my doctors just kind of ignore me when I mention the two. My gyno says talk to your GP and my GP says talk to your gyno. I was just wondering if you felt like your thyroid made things feel worse for you too. My pain is at an all time high and my thyroid is getting worse too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a binge eating problem too and do the same exact thing to myself. Then when I overdo it and make myself nauseous, I swear I'll never eat again and its just a vicious cycle :( 7Up, ginger ale, tums, Pepto, emetrol, and stepping outside for some fresh air are some things that help me sometimes. I also have anti-emetics I can take if it gets way too bad but I try to refrain from that. I hope you're feeling better by now :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been on the depo shot for 7 years now, and I was somehow one of the lucky gals who had no adverse effects. I do know that it took my body a while to adjust to it. I decided to try it after my gyno told me it'd basically stop my debilitating periods and might give me some relief. This was before I was even told it could possibly be something like Endo.  After two or three shots my periods slowed, the flow wasn't nearly as heavy,  the pain got better, and after the fourth or fifth shot my periods stopped completely. I do have the occasional spotting/bleeding, but I haven't had a full on period in years. I was diagnosed with stage 2 endo about five years ago through a lap, because the pain came back and I started having issues again. He removed what he could but I had it on my bladder and abdominal wall, and I know its all coming back full force cause I am debilitated daily with pain, nausea, bowel issues, basically what you are dealing with. I will not try lupron, and I really don't want to try a new BC while coming off of the depo, so my gyno gave me the option to have a full hysterectomy. I do not want children, and nor does my fiance whom I've been with for 8 years, so that's where I'm headed in the next couple months. All in all, the depo shot has been great to me up until the past year or so. I guess the endo is stronger than the depo now. But it may take a couple shots for you to figure out whether its going to be right for you. I know there's so many horror stories about it, but I guess I got lucky. Everyone is different :) I really wish you the best of luck. Just keep pushing for those answers, someone out there will help you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got very sick around a year ago and dropped down to 103 pounds, I'm 5'6". I developed hyperthyroidism and between that and not eating, I lost 87 pounds within 4-5 months. When they tried to register any body mass on a specific blood test I had, it didn't even register. I was severely malnourished and actually developed re-feeding syndrome. I ended up in the hospital and almost had a cardiac arrest at 22 years old. My heart rate was almost in the 200's and I've never been so scared in my life. It all started from being scared of vomiting when I ate, cause my body was so incredibly messed up. I screwed myself over with this phobia, and I'm just now getting my head above water (barely), but I still struggle daily. I had an incredibly hard time putting weight on and when I did, I lost it (unintentionally). All I ever heard was "Just fucking eat" or "It's your fault, you must want this." It hurt more than anything because no, never in my life did I want this. 
Well, here I am a little over a year later and I weigh 125 pounds :) It has taken A LOT to get to where I am, but without support of my Mom and fiance, I would probably be dead right now. I do have a weakened heart from all of this and still have some other health issues but I will tell you this, I fucking love food. I love cooking, baking, anything like that, and it is one thing that brought me back from the brink of death and helped me get a grip on my life and this phobia. 
I guess I just wanted to share this with you and tell you it IS possible to come back from all this, gain weight, and be considerably happy. I do have my moments, still have panic attacks, but I am able to handle them a little better. I now also realize how easy it is to lose your life to something like this, and so many people do not understand it. It's so tough, this sub has been such a huge relief to me and the people here, oh my god, they are fabulous. You are not alone :) Just keep your head up and keep trying your hardest. You'll get there, dude :) This didn't happen over a short period of time so it's not going to get better that easily, you're gonna hit rough patches at times, but that's what makes you stronger in the end :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know right now you feel like the world is ending, but I promise you it's not. I know how hard is must be on you mentally and physically coming off benzos, but it will all be better soon. It all ends at some point, just gotta remember that. But if you can try your hardest to take some tiny sips of water, it really might help. I know fatty greasy food can wreak havoc on your tummy but hey, at least you ate, right? :) You were hungry earlier and all was good, so that's a good sign. Just try and distract yourself with any little thing you can, take a shower, play a game on your phone, take a small walk if you can. It's all going to pass, I promise :) You've made it this far dropping your dose of xanax down without any massive effects, the worst is probably over :) I really hope you feel better, just try and calm down a little :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem :) Something that always stuck with me was one thing a good friend told me during a panic attack once; "You are in control." If I keep telling myself that, and that it will eventually end like it always does, it really does help me calm down. Most always, you really are in control. Not the nausea, panic, etc. Sometimes its really hard to believe that for some people, but for me it helps :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in Ohio and the weather here is so unpredictable. Its been in the 80's here too with high humidity and it makes me feel ill too :( I also have a heart condition so I could pass out easily, which makes my anxiety so much worse. We have actually been keeping our thermostat at 69 degrees to keep it nice and cold. I ALWAYS have ice water and dress as lightly as I can. If I start to feel the heat is really getting to me, I put an ice cold wash cloth on my forehead or neck, or take a cold shower (sometimes even a bath). I know how hard it is to keep hydrated when you have diarrhea and nausea, but small sips is the trick. I've never been weaned off any meds, I always just quit cold turkey so I am probably the worst person to give advice on that, but just know your body is trying its hardest to adjust and you will soon start feeling better once you get to the dose you need or get off them. I try my hardest to keep myself distracted, whether it be crafts, playing a game on my phone, reddit, it always helps. I really hope you start feeling better and have better luck with the heat this year. Try not to work yourself up, you got this :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So in regards to my post a couple of nights ago, I made it and am feeling much better as of today. I did end up going to the ER last night due to the fact that my temp was 100.3 and wouldn't go down. My cousin who is the main ER doc was on last night and he ran my urine and blood work twice and for once in my life, it was all clear. So I indeed did catch a bug :( BUT, as I was sitting in the room by myself, waiting for the doctor to come in, the man in the room next to me started v*Ing VERY loudly, it sounded so horrible but, I didn't freak out! Normally, I would have had a full blown panic attack right then and there but I was fine! I just felt bad for the poor guy. I know it may not seem like a big deal, but for me it was. Also, I succeeded in only taking 2 anti-emetics in the 48 hours I was ill. That's a huge accomplishment for me. 
I just thought I'd update everyone and share my somewhat of a little success story :) I've also eaten some toast and chicken noodle soup without having a panic attack so maybe I might be getting a hold on this. Here's to hoping! :)
