I need to get from Austin TX to New Orleans in hopefully one stint.

I'm not totally against renting a car and doing it myself or jumping on a plane but I was wondering what ride share sort of stuff is going on in the US at the moment and if there are any websites you all recommend? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Guys, I don't mean to spam but I love coming to Brisbane, I've been 3 times over the last couple of years but this is the first time I've ever played a show there.

We're in fact playing two gigs on Saturday 8th of August, one at the New Globe Theatre in the Evening with Punktilious, Alla Spina and Buzzkillers. And one in the arvo at the Cable Ski Park in Logan with Spitfireliar, Crooked Face and some others.

We're a punk band called Keggin that only sing about drinking booze and having a top time. You can check out our video here:

Again, I love your city and cannot wait to come up Friday!

	<TEXT> Okay, short backstory/real story. When I was 19, I went to Germany for 3 weeks, I was bitten by the travel bug and swore I would go see the world more but work and other commitments kept me grounded in Australia...

It's only just recently, since leaving my wife, that I've had money to spend on me and my goals. 

So that's why today, I booked some plane tickets, and on the eve of my 27th birthday, I will be flying to Los Angeles. I'll then be getting in a car and spending 6 weeks driving across the south of the USA, I seriously cannot wait! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where do you think I should go?

At the moment my trip goes a little something like this

Los Angeles - 
Las Vegas - 
San Francisco - 
Seattle - 
Vancouver - 
Toronto - 
NYC - 
Philadelphia - 
Cleveland - 
Louisville - 
Nashville - 
Memphis - 
Austin - 
Tijuana - 


Now, in saying that, I do want to visit some smaller, lesser know cities in and around these areas but still big enough to hang out, meet some lovely people, see some gigs and drink some beers... 

So where do you recommend that sort of follows this route?

(I will be flying as well to these destinations, keep in mind, except for SeattleVancouver which I'll take a Bus, as well as Philadelphia  Cleveland) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Guys, so, if you've ever driven past the Airport, coming from Bulla direction to the city, you would notice the Ansett Plane that is sitting, unused and dilapidated just off the tarmac. I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction as to how to get access to said plane. I'd like to do some filming but I don't know what section of the airport I would need to speak to?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  </TEXT>

My tourist permit will only allow me 3 months over there but I want to come over for said time and make some connections not only in the music scene but in fleet administration, which is what my current profession is. We can't party hard all the time! I understand I need to work hard to support myself and my goals. Those goals include forming a band of friends I can hang with that are all capable in their given field, touring extensively for a couple of months a year and extending my knowledge of my day job in another company overseas. I just don't see it happening here... anyway. If anyone knows how I can get started I can be over there as early as October. Cheers. </TEXT>
