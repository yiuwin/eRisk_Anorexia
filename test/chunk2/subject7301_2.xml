	<TEXT> I apologize for interrupting all of these exciting/inspiring college decision announcements, however I have a question regarding extracurricular activities as they relate to the application process.

I am a junior, and am a white female from an upper-class county in New Jersey. I currently have a 3.8 UW GPA, 5.0 W. All honors classes with only one completed AP course under my belt so far (APUSH - got a 5) because nearly all of them are not allowed in my school until junior year. I'm in all AP courses this year, including AP Physics and AB Calc. I'm planning on taking BC Calc next year. I just took the ACT for the first time this past weekend, and even though I don't have the results my one practice test I got a 33 without finishing. I finished this past one and feel fairly confident.

So, my problem now lies in my ECs. Until this year I planned on playing fast pitch softball in college (I'm a pitcher), but decided to not do so. So now I have barely any ECs. I am a member of Student Council, an anti-bullying organization called Peace Project, a Peer Leader, and I plan on becoming a member of NHS. Outside of school, I am an elected leader of my Church Youth Group. In terms of softball, I have pitched every single varsity softball game for my high school since the beginning of my freshman year, won team MVP my freshman and sophomore years (junior season hasn't started yet) and will be named captain of that team my senior year.

I don't expect to have any more leadership positions besides in softball and the church. **How do you recommend I make my ECs look better in these last two years?**

Thank you so much!!

Edit: just made the question bold in case no one wants to read the other info </TEXT>
