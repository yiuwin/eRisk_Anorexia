	<TEXT> I walked up to a bar with a couple of buddies one night. Had a couple drinks, did an Irish car bomb and broke the shot glass in the beer. I drank it anyway. That's not the worst part...

We started walking home and I was convinced that they were going the wrong way so I split up from them. One lost cell phone and 5 hours later, I emerged from the woods I got lost in. I then flagged down a security guard who thankfully, gave me a ride home. When I got home, my roommates were on the phone with the police. I then went right to bed. Bad night. </TEXT>
