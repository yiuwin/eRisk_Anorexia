	<TEXT> Huh? I'm not being a snob. I've dated people who didn't attend university and I earned less money than them. They encouraged me to drop out, they simply didn't understand. I'm not saying all are like this, but there is something to be said about having similar experiences. 

Of course when I'm done with my studies it wouldn't matter because I won't have to have arguments about spending more time in academia or why I drop money on coursework and not a house. You got lucky, but the vast majority of people consider grad school a waste. 

Sure this opinion is unpopular, but it's reality and it is how I pick my partners. I'm not telling OP to. Besides, I'm already married. Also I think it might be worth noting I'm in a country where bachelor degrees are "free" and a lot of people have a bachelor degree. Being university trained here is hardly prestigious  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, you won't be working in the ER unless you are an RN. CNAs do meals, cleaning and some bedside manner. You can even work as an orderly, transporting people around the hospital who are not in emergency care. 

If not nursing, you can do bartending, cake decorating - baking is actually becoming quite popular and with your love for wine you might be able to come up with something great. You can work on a vineyard or as a sommelier, or in catering or in a food processing factory. Heck, what about working at Amazon? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me? Yes. And the reason is I have gone and done 2 masters degrees and wish to maybe do a Phd or research masters as well. I'm a books and writing essays sort of person and academia gels well with me.
My partner just did a Bachelors. I wouldn't be with anyone who isn't university educated and this is not because I am being high and mighty. I cannot be with someone who doesn't understand how spending $60K on an expensive extra 2 years is worth it even if I don't get a career out of it, or someone who doesn't understand the stress, anxiety and the uncertainty that these years of study have. I desperately needed support through those tough 4 years only to now be earning about an average wage. 

This has little to do with me thinking I am high and mighty, but rather me needing someone who has been through what I have/am going through so they can best support me and not make me feel like I'm doing all of this for no good reason.

But if you aren't currently going through study or academic pursuits, then it shouldn't matter. And for me it wouldn't matter. After that PhD I'll be just as unemployable and unskilled as those who graduated high school lol. What matters the most are your goals and what you both want in life. If you both go well together, and have great chemistry and he understands you and cares for you, then who cares about a piece of paper that you have stashed in some folder because you can't be bothered getting it framed. Who cares if he works at retail or as a plumber? If he works hard and is responsible then his employment status and qualifications are as good as any. I don't think anywhere on our degrees it says to only marry or date those who have degrees, it's not like we need to be qualified to fall in love with who we do.

The best love comes from one without judgement where you love each other regardless of what social conventions say.  </TEXT>

HIV is not only contracted from promiscuous lifestyles or using drugs, sure that's an easy way to get it, but not the only way.

	<TEXT> Considering how many ethical processes I had to go through just to get my honours project which involved interviews and cognitive tasks on adults to be done, I honestly do not believe that such things will happen to a significant degree. There are and will continue to be limited labs, with limited staff and limited research. They will prioritise genetic disorders over something superficial like height and eye colour. Not to mention how expensive and time consuming the process will be. I think the more superficial stuff would be treated the same as plastic surgery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being a speech pathologist is great, but as with all specialists the amount of work you can do is minimal and you miss out on clients because you're only paid to work 3 days a week. I'd enter private practice but that's damn expensive for everyone involved. I also don't feel comfortable knowing people were charged $260 for a 15 minute consultation with me. I entered this field to help people and my inflexible work hours are so inconvenient for a lot of families who need to see public health professionals. I'm sure there are behavioural therapists with casual speechies who they can see using PBS or are only $20-40 an hour, but they still need to pay me for a consultation before they can do that if they want to claim Medicare. Not to mention getting to see me is a whole new gamble. My Saturdays are full and since most clients are children they have to wait to see me at least every month or two rather than every week like they should. 

If only our government care more about health rather than casualising the jobs of doctors and specialists we then may be able to have people who need my help getting my help they need, rather than them improving at unhelpfully slow pace and me staring at my finances wondering how the fuck I am going to pay off $90K of student fees and save for a house deposit on a $1200 weekly wage.  It's gotten to the point where I had to reopen my ballet school which I used to fund us through uni to now keep us afloat again... </TEXT>

To me it sounds like you can go ahead and voice your objections to same-sex marriage and protest, but it doesn't mean you can start getting violent or discriminate against gay people. It's more to me a go ahead and disagree with marriage equality and don't get gay married and you are fine to object against same-sex sex. No one will arrest you for protesting. From how it reads it doesn't sound like you are permitted to deny services or discriminate, but rather holding such opinions will not make you lose your job or be prosecuted.  </TEXT>

I think that's as inclusive as necessary. When the acronym starts adding 2 spirit and aromantic and pansexual it really misses the point when queer essentially encompasses that. I really don't get the whole 'equal representation' thing because by the end of it, we cannot represent every brand of queer by a single letter in an acronym. It's not possible. It's like me asking for where the Japanese/Russian tick box is when I do surveys and registers rather than just ticking the mixed race or other box, or the box I most identify with. We sometimes have to just admit we are a diverse group and need to cut our losses rather than claim our own movement is alienating us.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm now 22 (turning 23 in a couple of weeks) and have been living with my partner since we were 18. It was HARD. So, we moved interstate, we both got jobs, he joined the military and I worked as a dance teacher. We rented a place at $500 per week, plus $200'per week of bills, because welcome to Australia, it's fucking expensive. When money is tight, no matter how much you love each other, expect to argue. And if you are the couple who cannot handle arguments, then don't bother. Rentals are bounded by a legal contract. You can't just decide to then separate and move away from each other if your lease is for 24 months. You need to learn to very quickly forgive and move on and if you do break up, how to live with each other. 

Now. Onto the stuff you actually need to hear. :) There are 3 fundamental things you need to learn how to do when living out of home: how to clean, cook and use spreadsheets. 

So cleaning, really simple. Make sure you both know what you are allergic to and if any of you react to certain chemicals. I for one cannot clean with bleach because I am sensitive to the fumes. You only need 3 types of cleaner - toilet cleaner, floor cleaner and window cleaner. For wiping down benchtops and cleaning taps or furniture, just use diluted white vinegar with lavender or eucalyptus oil. You don't need stove/oven cleaner if you just wipe after every use with a damp dish soapy sponge, and microwaves are easy to clean by microwaving a bowl of water and lemon juice then wiping. A lot of furniture cleaner I've found is overpriced and worthless, you really are just looking to get rid of dust and fingerprints. If you do enjoy cutting chicken on the bench top, I do recommend using Pine O Clean spray. 
Oh and try to get a place with floorboards and tiles, no carpet. That shit is easy to stain and hard to clean. The last thing you want is to have to pay for new carpet if you stain it. 
If you are buying new furniture, go to IKEA, it is easy to transport and break down for when you move when your lease is up/something happens. We made the mistake of having furniture which didn't breakdown and had to sell a lot/throw out stuff. 

For cooking, I like to use Taste.com.au, they have a lot of really tasty and wholesome recipes which are cheap to make. My favourite thus far has been lemongrass beef noodle salad. Mmmm. Speaking of, you only need one pot and one decent sized frying pan with some depth to it, but do get at least three good quality chopping knives. Another note on cooking, always have written down what you have in the fridge, the quantity and when you bought it and when it expires. You can also search using ingredients you have for recipes you can make, but my philosophy has always been that anything can turn into a curry or a pasta. 

Now this is where spreadsheets get useful. I Google sheets for this since it's easy to open up when shopping. Create multiple sheets, one to track your finances and the other to track your food. So for food I have columns for what they are, when I bought them, when they expire and the quantity. Using this method I never throw out my food and can easily know what I need to repurchase since I set it so that when quantities reach 0 the ingredient turns red (yellow when it is 1-2). You save money doing this too. 
We also use spreadsheets to track our finances - we start by putting in our weekly earnings (expenditures are weekly in Aus, it may be different in the US and elsewhere) and then add factors like the cost of rent, the expected price of bills, groceries etc, and items we have purchased, unexpected spendings like medicines and a 5-10% savings deposit and then a list of items we plan to purchase like gifts, leisure and books for uni. This sounds like a lot, and it is, costs and spending are much more than you expect when you first start moving out. It is also important that you both have your own savings account, and I highly recommend having a shared spending account to pay for rent and bills. This account should not have a credit card and should be solely used for bills. We do this by using the spreadsheet system to dump in how much we expect the bills to cost evenly and if there is money left over we leave it in for the next lot of bills. Now if you cannot trust each other with a shared account then it will be harder. But it is absolutely fundamental that both of you are on the contract for the rental so that not one of you will be held accidental for not paying up.
Also it will be helpful to have at least 4-6 months of rent in your savings account in the event that either of you end up losing work or something unfortunate happens. You need spotless rental history otherwise getting loans or other rentals will be harder. 

Also. Insurance. Please get insurance.

	<TEXT> I have been saying that Trump is essentially trolling the Republicans. I don't believe he believes in what he said during his campaign, or even what the Republicans stand for, he simply used their rhetoric to win, which is smart. Historically, Trump had been in support for LGBT people and suggested amendment of the Civil Rights Act to disallow discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

Do I think Trump is a great guy going to solve all of America's problems? No, I would have voted against him had I been American because of what he said during his campaign and what that then legitimises. But do I think he will actually be a good candidate for the Republicans? No, I think he will be the biggest Republican mistake in history because of how useless to the party he will be. At least I hope so, because he doesn't seem like the person to care enough about what people think let alone responsibility to actually create action. He'll cause more problems by opening his mouth than actually doing anything. America will most likely stagnate, but protests and disputes will continue because of the anti-21st century rhetoric that will be thrown around.

His VP though is a threat. He's legitimising hatred against LGBT individuals, not to mention that he's a massive closeted douche. If anything, we should be more watchful of Pence than Trump. Trump lacks some Republican support, but Pence is the powerful one with Republican backing. It could be likely you guys have an Australian situation where the party turns against the leader and appoints the VP to president instead. That would be scary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YAAAAY well done :) and welcome to med school my friend. As for whether to do family medicine or psychiatry, I'd say family medicine, it is more holistic and you will be more likely to work with LGBT individuals than a psychiatrist, also they are the frontline for LGBT people needing help, the first point of call and we really do need more of them. 

Anyway, don't feel discouraged at all! Even if you find out it's not right for you, just getting into med school will open up so many opportunities like psychology and other health related sciences or even becoming a specialist nurse. I wish you all the best and good luck :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would not go and outright say that preorders are a bad thing. I've preordered twice in my life - Bioshock Infinite and Fallout 4; was not at all disappointed. People need to be more careful with what they preorder. I was excited for Deus Ex and Dishonoured but didn't preorder because of one simple fact: we didn't hear enough about the gameplay and the features. All we were shown were the nice graphics and the cinematics. To me, this is a good metric of deciding if something is worth investing in. You need to ask yourself that if the game did not have the polish seen in the trailers if it is worth your money because that polish is worthless if the gameplay is not up to par. If you can safely say yes, then you're good for preorder.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of them would, but I think in a country where escorting is legal you will be hard pressed as most are closeted or married men and they prefer the comfort of anonymity an escort service provides. Besides, you'd be competing with escorts who often do get a sugar daddy experience. I did get gifts, but I also reinforced to them that while it was nice it wasn't necessary. You can fall into danger territory when men get obsessed, or think that they love you or that you love them. I know people who have felt guilted into continuing sugar daddy relationships or were threatened and manipulated into not calling them off. Escorting, because it is more formal and full of safe guards, is safer in my experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in Australia. They often come here to study and to get away from the strong structure of their family back home. These people are often quite wealthy. They don't live in student accomodation, they live in a nice inner city apartment their parent's bought. Their grades don't matter, instead their social standing does so that they can marry within their high social class in order to maintain it for their family. Boys especially are often arranged into marriages because they are the ones the family relies on to take care of the family. I'm sure it is more complex but that is what I've been told.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked as an escort for about 2-3 years in a big diverse city so my story may be a little different. My price was fairly high as I was young (19) and in really good shape. My clients tended to be wealthy and married in their mid 30s-50s, either curious or closeted. I occasionally would get the nervous virgin or the guy who never tried to top before or the guy who wanted to explore fetishes or other sexual exploration in a safe environment free from judgement. 

I also had a very diverse clientele. I'd say half were white men and the rest were from very traditional and religious families. I had a lot of Chinese international students who were stuck with facing an arranged marriage back home or Middle Eastern men worried about their faith and families.

I think the biggest stereotype for clients is that they are sexual deviants, disrespectful or promiscuous. Keep in mind, there is a huge negative stigma attached to being with an escort, if anything most of the men I was with were very careful not to offend me. Also, we didn't always have sex. Sometimes we'd just talk, go on a date, watch a movie or just cuddle. 

I feel like I am more lucky than most male escorts. Prostitution is legal here and the brothel I worked at was run by an older couple who would cook us food, help us find stable work and get those of us on drugs off drugs. It certainly wasn't ideal though and I'm glad to move on, but sex work for me was not as negative as a lot of people assume it to be </TEXT>

However, if she bleeds from anything she does treat herself and take responsibility to reduce infecting others but it's not at all hard or difficult. It's not majorly life changing unless the price of the meds jump. You know, people with HIV can still have children so long as they take their medication and there is no need for IVF that way either. So long as he takes his medication regularly and keeps his doctor visits in check, you don't have anything to worry about. 

If you do want to be extra safe, you can talk to your doctor about options you can have such as unprotected sex if you take a low dose of Truvada etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In your original post does it mention when you had unprotected sex? No. Receiving a blood transfusion that is screened multiple times and comes up undetected each time vs having sex with someone who only had one test shows how even something we fail to find can still affect us. 

I am not going to sit here and tell you that you made the right decision in not taking the necessary precautions that governments spend millions of dollars of hoping you take preventative healthcare. You should be worried and in a state of panic. This is serious. Not something you sweep under a rug and hope you are fine because you are at lower risk. It is called lower risk,not invincibility. HIV is a devastating illness that is very easy to contract if there is contact with blood and semen. Look, I know you're scared, but understating the issue is the absolute last thing you should do in anything in life. Reach out to support groups, get tested, get any emergency treatment, get onto PrEP so not only do you keep a potential viral load down or out, but you can also have as much risky sex as you want with that. There is help out there and people to talk to who can help you through this and make you less anxious. But saying that you can't deal with the possibility because it makes you panic is the wrong way to deal with it. You need to accept the possibility and endure the panic because getting help will get rid of all of your anxiety. And you know what, even if you don't have HIV. It would still be worth it for the peace of mind. I mean would you rather take the morning after pill or wait 3-6 months? </TEXT>

Sex without a condom with someone who's status you don't know counts as such. It's ridiculous otherwise. I mean what are they going to do? Avoid giving it to someone who may have been exposed to it? http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/pep.html

Get informed. It's the only thing that will save your life now.

And more information:

"guidelines concerning the viral load of the source patient have recently changed. If the patient is known to have undetectable HIV viral load (200 copies HIV RNA/ml), PEP was previously not recommended. However, it is now recommended that PEP should be offered to those who are anxious about the risk.[3]"

"An exposure is defined as exposure to potentially infected blood, tissue or bodily fluids..." In other words, you don't have to know whether or not it is infected. If you are exposed to it and don't know, they treat it like you have contracted it. http://patient.info/doctor/hiv-post-exposure-prophylaxis </TEXT>

With SSRIs, there is a lot of genetic and metabolic interactions. I fir one could only take citalopram and had to take it with a probiotic. Otherwise my digestive system went off. Escitalopram made me have constant panic. There is a very small difference between the two drugs, but my genetics warranted that I metabolise escitalopram too quickly giving me too much too soon. There is a lot of trial and error with these meds, in order to eliminate that you can undergo a pharmacology profile where they look into your DNA to see which will work best for you.
