	<TEXT> Thank you! He gets hours of cuddles every day. He is my first cat and I'm pretty sure he is abnormally cuddly; I've read that cats tend to bite or scratch after their fill of belly rubs but he is just the biggest sack of snuggles around!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend and I were camping at a state park where you'd have to go online and reserve a lot and pay a fee (about $20/night). They then put a little sign on the post in front of the site with the reservation details. We went during an off-season, so both of the lots on either side of us were not reserved. At about 9pm an RV chugs into the lot next to us. "That's weird, it wasn't reserved," I thought. Then we didn't think much else of it. We went about making our fire and roasting hotdogs/ s'mores. Later that night when we were laying down in our tent, we heard the phone ring of the person in the RV. She picked up and started talking about the spiders she's been collecting for her "spider stew". She said she had found plenty on the site and it's going to be a good batch. My bf and I both turned to each other to see if the other was hearing the same conversation. When we woke up the next morning at 6:30 she was already gone. Anyway, that's got to be the strangest convo I've overheard. </TEXT>
