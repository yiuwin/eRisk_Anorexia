	<TEXT> So basically the forces are not necessarily equal at H/2, so you need to add another force to hold the masses at H/2? No need to answer if this is correct. Now that you mention it, it does seem to be worded that way. That's a pretty silly way of stating the length of the cord if you ask me ... But anyway, thanks for answering </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought so too. Thank you for answering. But there is something that I don't understand then. In fact, the question was asked in the wake of this problem that I was trying:
http://www.feynmanlectures.info/exercises/mass_on_an_incline.html
I found the wording strange, because it states that the system is at rest at H/2. On top of that, the solution to question a seems to imply that at different heights, the forces are not equal because there is an acceleration at different heights. This shouldn't be the case since the tension force in the string will not change. 
Could this be due to friction in the pulley? The friction of the cord would change the tension at different heights because the longer the string passing on the pulley, the bigger the friction force. 
Thanks for answering </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right, the chisel would impale him. Your teacher would be right if the chisel and him were not in contact but somehow pushed on each other if they were at a distance. In that case you would not have to deal with the forces from a solid.  

The human body is more or less a rigid body, in that it will not bend, and that a force applied on any part of the body will be transferred to the rest of it provided it can sustain that force. This is a bit akin to a table. Pushing on the tabletop transfers the force through the table, but if you push too hard, with an elephant's weight for example, the part of the table feeling the force will not be able to sustain that force and will break away from the rest of the table. This is what breaking is about. Stabbing is more or less the same thing as cutting, but over a very small area. 

By striking the chisel, the mass imparts a change in momentum, which causes the chisel to gain a certain velocity. The chisel will then exert a force on the body, because it is trying to push through a solid. The body reacts by conservation of momentum, and pushes back on the chisel. 

Just after the mass strikes the chisel, the chisel's tip pushes against the chest with a certain force, which the chest reacts to by exerting a normal force. However, if the chisel is sharp enough, it will exert a force larger than the chest can sustain, the chest will "break", that is, the chest will not be able to sustain the normal force that it exerts and will move apart to let the chisel through. This is the impalement. 

Then, the chisel will continue its way through the body, till it stops due to the normal forces from the organs. In exchange the chisel will transfer its momentum to the body so that the body moves backwards slowly. 

What would happen if the chisel was not sharp, but instead as blunt as a ball? In that case, the force it would exert would be over a larger area on the chest, and the chest would be able to respond in kind with a normal force. There will be convoluted compression forces which will transfer the momentum so that the direction of ball's velocity is reversed. The body will proceed downwards, and should be more than a corpse this time around.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is tension the same regardless of length? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello.
Consider the following situation: two masses are attached by a pulley-string system, and one mass lies on an incline. The pulley lies at the apex of the slope, so that it looks something like this:
http://imgur.com/a/YIef7
The green line is the string. Assume the string and pulley are massless and frictionless, and that the slope is frictionless. Essentially ideal conditions.
My question is this: if at a certain height from the ground the tension in the string is such that the masses are at rest, will moving either mass a little bit, so that the length of the string on either side changes, will there be a net force? That is, will the tension change if I move one of the masses a little bit further or closer away to the pulley?

In an Atwood machine, which is basically the same thing, but both masses are completely vertical, the tension does not depend on the length of the string on either side, but instead only on the difference in their weights. So why would adding a slope change this?

Thank you for answering </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I say weight, I mean the weight in the traditional sense, that is, mass.

When a dart and the dartboard stick together, you will agree that they are both stationary right? And when you throw the dart, the dart is moving. The dartboard does not move. 

Because of the formula E = mc^2, energy will have an associated mass with it. When moving the dart has kinetic energy, which it loses when it collides, in the form of heat. This kinetic energy adds a certain amount of mass to the dart, equal to KE/c^2 where KE is the kinetic energy and c is the speed of light. 

When the dart sticks to the board, it loses all this kinetic energy because friction with air and the board removes this energy and transfers it to the surroundings. Because of this the dartboard + dart has less energy than the dart when you throw it, plus that of the dartboard (the energy of the dartboard does not change). Since there is less energy when stuck together, there must consequently be less mass. The mass difference is exactly equal to that of the kinetic energy of the dart, divided by c^2. 

As an aside, what is interesting is if you did the same thing but everything was frictionless. In that case, the dart and the dartboard cannot lose energy by heat, so then considering them separately and together makes no difference for the mass. 

The effect is extremely small for small speeds though. The speed of light is about 3 hundred million m/s. Squaring that gives you 9 followed by 16 zeroes, and I don't even know what this number is called. The average dart speed is about 20 m/s. To calculate kinetic energy you must square the speed, so you get 400. 400/9 (16 zeroes)  than 1. About 0.(14 zeroes), so of course not detectable for average speeds </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you mean solve for x? 
You would have to compute i^i.
To do that, the e^i*pi = -1 from above. i = sqrt(-1) which is the same as -1^(1/2). So raise both sides to the power of 1/2. You get:

-1^(1/2) = e^(ipi/2), because of the properties of exponents, the power half on the right just multiplies the power of e.  So you have:

i = e^(ipi/2). Raise them to power i. You get:

i^i = e^(ipi * i/2)  i * i = -1, so

i^i = e^-(pi/2). So

x = e^(-pi/2). Use a calculator for the right side and you have the answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are interested in finding the motion of one body under gravity, that is, if you wish to describe the orbit of a planet around an extremely heavy mass so that the heavy mass's acceleration can be neglected, then you could try a geometrical approach. 

The following link explores a method  originally presented by Feynman of deriving Kepler's laws from Newton's law of Gravity and then describes the orbit of a planet for different initial velocities. It is geometry-based though:
http://journal.geometryexpressions.com/pdf/kep.pdf

Once you know the solution for one body, you can address the two-body problem because the centre of mass behaves like a one-body with an effective mass known as the reduced mass, equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the masses of the two bodies. Three bodies or more, and you have to resort to approximation methods.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Integration by substitution (Ibs) is just the chain rule, but in reverse. It is to the chain rule what integration by parts is to the product rule. 

The chain rule states the following:
if you want to differentiate f(g(x)) with respect to x, then you do:
df(g(x))/dg(x)   * dg(x)/dx to obtain the derivative. 
Of course dg(x) is rather confusing to deal with, so to make it easier, we use a different notation. We define a variable u = g(x) instead. Then the formula becomes:
df(u)/du * du/dx.

For example, say you want to differentiate (sin x^2). Then, g(x) = x^2, and f(x) = sin x. Composing the two gives the original function. So to make things easier, you define u = g(x) = x^2. Then differentiate f with respect to u. f(u) = sin u, so df/du = cos u. 

Then differentiate g(x) with respect to x to get 2x. Multiply the two to get 2x cos u. But it is better to express everything in terms of x, so you remember that u = x^2, and you get 2x cos x^2.

Now for Ibs we repeat the process in reverse. In this case, you would have the results of the chain rule, and you want to work your way back to f(g(x). Lets say you have a function h(x). And you know that h(x) is the result of the chain rule. Thus:
h(x) = df(u)/du * dg(x)/dx
You want h(x)dx. This is what gives f(g(x)). How to do this? You know how to integrate df(u)/du du, but not the product of derivatives. Perhaps there is a way of rewriting h(x) dx in the above form so that you can integrate easily. 

If you replace h(x) in h(x) dx by the derivative product you obtain:

df(u)/du du.  

So there is a way after all. To ease our work, let us define a function w(u) = df(u)/du. This definition emphasises the fact that since we do not know f(u), we do not know df(u)/du. 
Anyway, since you see that if you were to rewrite h(x) in terms of u instead of x, where u = g(x), you can integrate easily by getting rid of the product. This is the idea of substitution: absorb one function of x into a variable u, so that you can integrate easily. But also note that in the work we did above, we also had to use du to simplify our work. Thus we must replace x and dx by some u and du.

 Before touching on the finer points of substitution, let us look at an example: the integral of 2x cos (x^2), since we already know the answer from above: sin (x^2).

We have h(x)dx = 2x cos(x^2) dx.
We want to pick a u = g(x) to simplify this. We also have du = dg(x), so we want a g(x) that is easy to pick. To do so notice that: 2x dx = d(x^2). Then we can rewrite the above as:
d(x^2) cos (x^2).

Now g(x) becomes clear: it is x^2. So we write u = x^2, and then replace to get:

cos u du, which is easily integrated to get sin u + C, where C is the constant of integration but we don't care about it so we can ignore it. Anyway, remembering again that you were supposed to write this in terms of x, and that u =x^2 you get sin x^2, and we know that that is correct.

So the basis of substitution is to act as a reverse to the chain rule. Of course, we will not always know what g(x) was originally, so we have to guess what it was by trial and error. The above example was easy, partly because it was obvious, and partly because we did the chain rule beforehand, but in reality it is an art to find the g(x) that best simplifies the integral. 

Despite the basis of the integration by substitution, it can be used to simplify integrals as well, instead of only reversing the chain rule. This is commonly done by using trigonometric functions for u and identities. For example consider:
1/(x^2 + a^2) dx, where a is a constant. Despite the apparent difficulty, one can simplify this by swapping the roles of x and u: that is, instead of u = g(x), x = g(u). The reason behind this is the identity:

(tan^2  + 1) = sec^2 ().

If  a tan u = x, it would greatly simplify the integral. If you replaced:

1/a^2(tan^2 u + 1)dx = 1/(a^2 sec^2 ) dx. 
I factored a out in the first step. We got rid of x, but we still need to address the dx. To do this:

a tan u = x

dx/du = a sec^2 u

dx = a sec^2 u du.

Replace again:

1/a^2 sec^2  dx =  a sec^2 u du/(a^2 sec^2 )
= sec^2 u du/a sec^2 
Then the sec^2s cancel out and you obtain:

du/a, which is easily integrated to give u over a. Then remember a tan u = x so atan (x/a) = u, where atan is the inverse of tan and you get:

(atan (x/a))/a.

So as you can see, substitution can also be used in ways other than to reverse the chain rule. Well technically, you are conceptually reversing the chain rule above because you went through all the definitions of u and so on, but practically you chose to introduce u even though it was not obvious, so practically speaking you are just creatively integrating. 

Also, if you are interested in learning basic calculus in a very easy way, I recommend Calculus for the practical man by J. S . Thompson. It's a book that covers all the basics in ways that are more logical than the traditional methods, and it is very easy to follow. It is old, so you can find it for free on Gutenburg.org.

They know that they are there for learning, even the bottle flippers. They will avoid anything detrimental to their own learning by themselves. Students are not as dumb or as apathetic as they are made to be. 
If they flip the bottle or throw paper, they do it in a non-disruptive way, perhaps before the teacher comes, or when the teacher is doing nothing. Definitely not in the middle of an important lesson. And considering that the total amount of lunch and break adds up to 30 mins a day, no wonder they are wont to do so. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Basic Julia Sets] Understanding Julia sets in general </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-07 15:31:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Greetings fellow learnmathers. 
I wish to solicit your help for understanding Julia sets, and I have a few questions, so please bear with me. I'm  not too sure of the level of the question because I'm just taking an online course. Before my questions, a note on notation: I shall use f(z) if I mean repeated iterations of a function of z throughout. In the case that f(z) has a different meaning in the post, I shall specify it. Here are my questions:

 1. A Julia set for f(z) is dependant on the value of z, right? z is a complex number.

 2. If the answer to 1. is yes: When plotting a filled-in Julia set, what do I plot? Do I plot z if f(z) is bounded? Or do I plot every value of f(z) for each iteration of the function of z if f(z) is bounded?

 If the answer to 1 is no: Then what exactly is a Mandelbrot set? I   saw it defined as the connected Julia set for a certain z. So what  would that mean if a Julia set depends on the function only and  not on z?

 3. In a graphical coloured representation of a filled-in Julia set, the colourful parts are actually the points not in the filled-in set correct? And the black points are those in the Julia set?

 4. Finally, there is a certain formula which defines a Julia set for a quadratic of the form z^2 + c where both are complex numbers. It was:
  (1 + sqrt(1 + 4abs(c))/2  = R

From what I understood from the lecture, if you drew a disc radius R, centred at 0,(a disc being a circle shape not including the boundaries of the circle), 
then if the absolute value of any iteration of the quadratic  R, it was part of the filled-in Julia set. In other words, if the value of f(z) at any iteration was smaller than or equal to R, it would be part of the filled-in set. 

My question is how was this formula derived? No derivation was given in the course. I can  see that it is very close to one solution to the quadratic z^2 + c = z, but only if c  0 and real. But I don't even know why it would be equal to that. Any explanation and derivation would be appreciated. 


As an aside, according to Reddit formatting help * x gives bullet point x, but when I tried doing it for my list, all numbers turned to bullet point 1s instead. Any idea why? 
Thank you for answering my questions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always found the argument stupid. It is based on what happens when you die. Why would you take an argument that is based on something you are unsure of -life after death- at face value? I'd rather take an argument that is based on what happens when you are alive. At least everybody agrees that you are alive, and you are guaranteed to get the best of your life. 
And in general, atheism can provide what is best for life because of how pressure-free it is. So if you apply Pascal's Wager, but replace after death with life, the argument goes the other way round, and has more substance because it is based on something everybody agrees on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the maths taught in high school and so on are based on a certain set of axioms  that seemed to reflect the physical world and it is true that you cannot deduce the other axioms. But nothing actually dictates what axioms you can choose, so these axioms are completely arbitrary, which is how we end up with a lot of maths.

The case of Euclid's axiom was not that common or so I would think. So what I meant is that the axioms of a given system of mathematics are unlikely to arise as a consequence of the others as was supposed for Euclid's parallel axiom, and thus they cannot lose their status as an axiom. In that sense, they cannot be debunked. 

I never heard of the inherent counting till three of humans. That's interesting to know, so thanks for informing me. 

And about the disclaimer, I am still in high school so whatever I am saying is not learnt in school, but self-taught from around the internet. I might be wrong too. Then again, as Feynman said, authority in sciences is not something important </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before reading this, sorry for the long post, but it is pretty hard to answer your question with a short answer because it is broad and deep.

The mathematical models used in science are guesses. Educated guesses. These guesses are then taken and checked against reality in experiments, and then these guesses are refined based on that, perhaps a lot of scrapped altogether and replaced by some other guess. A lot of science is trial and error, or serendipitous discoveries. It is very rare that those eureka moments like in the movies happen. 

A good example of this is our idea of how things fall. Aristotle guessed that heavier things fall faster, but Galileo refuted his guess by (supposedly) dropping two things from the tower of Pisa and seeing them fall at same time. His guess was refuted and his theory was replaced by another guess.

A lot of the maths is abstract. It is abstract in the sense that it helps us analyse what will happen. See, there is this distinction between the observable and the unobservable. You look at the distance between two objects. At the rate this distance changes. At how hard it is to get the object to move. At whether the object moves in a circle, a line, a loop the loop or whatever. 

Because of how quantitative this becomes, it is very easy to assign numbers to it. This is where the maths comes in. Our mind naturally brings the maths to this topic. Our mind naturally says speed = distance over time. The inkling of maths here is intuitive. But it is not enough for science. Science has to describe and predict, which naturally entails explanations. What I am doing here is saying what I can see, the observable. I want more. I want to explain. And seen how the maths comes here so easily and how it perfectly describes what we see, it makes sense to use maths to try and explain this. 

From that point on we venture into the unobservable. This is where all those magical equations seemingly spring from. This is where the guesses become important too. We look at the world and we try to come up with some theory explaining the observations. This is the key. No matter what your theory is, if at the end of the day, it does relate to what you can see, like distance or velocity, it is rubbish.

 And this is also how scientists interpret their results. It is not looking at some piece of paper and saying "aha! so this goes there and that goes there and voila: rocket science. " It is looking at theory, looking for the distance or velocity or whatever it is, and then just rearranging your equations to obtain these quantities. 

If I told you that the length of a wall without a door is so and so, and that with the door it is so and so, you know that the door's length is the difference of the two. You know what this length means from the symbols on your paper the length of the door. And this is no different from rocket science except that you don't know what lengths you need and what you have to do with them. Theories are there to tell you what to do. 

The atomic model is an example of a theory. Based on the properties of solids and so on, it tells you that the particles are packed so and so. And then it tells you that if this model is true, one meter cubed of solid takes more effort to move than one meter cubed of liquid, and this is something you can see, a relation between the observable and the unobservable.

So you may ask and you did "so how do they make this theory". Let us take an example, say momentum. Momentum is some quantity that is said to be equal to weight times velocity, and theory says that no matter what you do the total momentum will not change. There are two parts to this statement: the equation for momentum, and how momentum does not change. 

The first part is what appears alien because it is out of the blue. And indeed, it is actually more or less out of the blue. Different quantities were tried, but we found that this was the simplest definition that is the most useful. That is, with this equation we can relate many things to the outside world. The second part of the theory, that it is conserved also played a part: this definition is useful precisely because of that. So we can look at the world in terms of momentum, and get relations from that for observable quantities. 

Another way to look at the world is through energy. Energy is simply an abstract quantity, which is expressed through an equation, just like momentum, and that has useful properties that can relate observable quantities. It arises from serendipity and analysis. There are relations between momentum and energy of course, because in the end they describe the same thing in different ways. 

So in the end, we get those equations from trial and error, and keep those that are useful and relate them to things we can measure.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Touch is only the name given to some microscopic phenomenon. When we say touch on a macroscopic basis we mean that two objects are literally sharing a boundary. Think of when you overlay two books. Their covers are touching, which is just a way of saying that the surface of the cover of each book are sharing the same space. 

In reality the atoms of each cover on not sharing the same space, at least not in the sense of how the covers share the same space. There is a separation between the atoms. On a macroscopic level, this separation is so small that for all intents and purposes there is no separation, but on an atomic scale, this separation is important. 
So touch is more or less just a description of distance between atoms, since it just says that the atoms are so close together that on a macroscopic scale they are essentially sharing the same space. 

As to the question, you need a force to cause the sound. Sound is just atoms around that are "disturbed", that is, they are forced to move. To get them to move there has to be a push or pull, or in the case of sound a push and pull. On a macroscopic scale, it seems that these forces are exerted by touch, in the sense described above. We feel as if we are sharing the same space as something and this is what causes it to move. On the microscopic scale, of course, the atoms are not really on top of one another even when we say that we are touching something. 

So there is a force that acts without actual contact. Forces like this are seen on a macroscopic scale: gravity is the most common one, then magnetism and then electricity. The Earth never touches the Sun (which is obvious because we are not fried potatoes yet), but the Sun still exerts a force on the Earth. In the same sense the atoms never touch, but there still is a force between them, electrical in this case. In fact, if you look at the forces on the subatomic level, the fundamental forces, you see that they all are forces that work at a distance, without contact, because based on the above definition, contact cannot exist on an atomic level. You can't have atoms on top of each other and with a slight separation at the same time. 

In the case you described, you clap, that is you bring the atoms (well, technically molecules, which are joined up atoms, but atoms, but atoms keeps in the spirit of the discussion at the cost of some accuracy) of your left hand next to your right hand. So close in fact, that on a macroscopic scale, your hands touch. Now, there are two interesting properties with the electrical force: it decreases rapidly the further you are, and like charges repel, unlike charges repel, and like-unlike charges attract each other. Atoms have a very intricate mixture, so that they always have the same number of positive and negative charges. Because of this, you don't feel objects that are from you pressing into you. If atoms were negative, then you would feel the force from things away from you. Touching would no more be when atoms are extremely close; it would be when objects are a metre away (or more, but you get the idea). And because of this, you stay whole: the positive charges hold the negative charges with the attractive force.

When atoms are very close to each other, negative charges of each atom are closer to each other than the positive charges of an atom are to their negative charges. In other words, because of how the electric force increases the closer you are, there is a stronger force trying to push the atoms away than there is trying to attract them. This repulsive force is what you feel when touching. The small separation between your hands' atoms causes them to move backwards, into your hands. But there are other atoms in your hands, so the first few atoms that when in are pushed back by them. But the first few atoms push other atoms backwards, and you set off a chain reaction. At the same time, those atoms pushed back to their original place move too far, and get pulled backwards, and then are pushed forwards again and it goes on back and forth, like a pendulum.  It is a bit like those dominoes lines where you push one domino back, and then every other domino falls, except that when a domino falls, you pick them up, set up the line, and then push the dominoes the other way. 

Except that the atoms at the back of your hand push on the air, and they transfer the reaction to the air. Its like adding a white line of dominoes to your line of pink ones, and then eventually you stop setting up the pink ones, but play a little bit more with the white ones. This sets the air molecules moving back and forth and this back and forth motion reaches the ear drum and sets the drum moving  back and forth and your brain picks on that back and forth motion and detects a sound. The back and forth motion of the particles in the hands, air and drum are due to the fact that there are the atomic forces. Yes the atoms are pushed away, but the forces call them back to where they are, and when the come back they come with too much momentum and get pushed back again. Its like a pendulum except that instead of a string getting the bob back, you have a whole host of atoms doing that. This is why I said you need a push and pull for sound, one to pull the atoms back, and one to push them forwards. </TEXT>

Macs last longer than Windows because they do not slow down so much with time, and they are so much more user friendly. On top of that, you have a guarantee of quality which is not something you get from Windows laptops, at least over here, and a good warrantee, and it is cheaper compared to the same specifics for Windows. And the virus protection is pretty nifty. I know macs are not immune but viruses on shady websites target windows a lot more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those designer breeds are basically the equivalent of someone having a baby with his half sister, who is also his mother and grandmother, and whose father is the cousin of her mother, and the uncle of the guy's father. They are the result of incestion. 

I have three adorable pups (I call them that, but they are approaching 2 years already and I don't plan to stop even when they are full grown pups) that came off the road. Some bastard wrenched them from their mother and threw them down a drain, where they were stuck and starved and about to die. 

Rescued them, got them vaccinated for a cheap fee of about $10 each, and they look so cute that everybody has to stop and look at them. In my opinion they look so much better than any of the purebreeds. Also much more resilient to everything. I must admit that they are extremely fearful of anybody but those who live with them, and a lot of other things as well, but having gone through what they have, they have earned this right. Hopefully they will loosen up more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once took a course on physics which had lots of programming in it. They offered prewritten code and you just had to change parameters here and there to fit your experiment. I had absolutely no idea of what I was doing and what should have taken 10-15 mins took 2 to 3 hours. 

But I liked the idea and took a course or two. But rather than learn the coding and programming basics, I just learnt the language and then pieced more and more of the theory behind together as I learnt other languages. 

I agree that most online courses seem to have this assumption that you have the faintest idea of what is going on. But I found one that is pretty decent, so I shall give it to you if you are interested. Codeacademy is not bad for some languages either. Also the course is not only that, loads and loads of testing the code has to be done to make sure you know what x or y does. After some time you get an idea of what is going on.

So if ever you feel like learning programming I suggest that you start with a simple language ( I started with Python and the website I mentioned is only for Python. Besides Python is probably the best for beginners anyway). 

Don't bother too much about technical terms, and build up by taking beginner courses from different sources, and then perhaps moving on to beginner courses in other languages then moving on to intermediate ones. 

Also try making lots of differences in your code and testing what effect it has, like for example Python takes its spaces seriously so try to see to what extent you can mess with the spaces. In time you will get an idea of what is going on and learn technical terms through osmosis. The whole point in learning coding this way is just to be able to turbo out something, and as you build up you learn more and more about the technical aspects.

It is a bit like learning math or piano I guess, in the sense that in both you start by learning the practical aspects like adding on your fingers or playing the keys on a piano before learning the actual reason you are doing what you are doing and why it works. Anyway leave a comment here if you are interested.

Adding and subtracting are more complicated. You need to have the same denominator, as already mentioned. The reason can be seen in this:

Imagine you measure some length in meters. Then you measure another length in centimetres. You want to find the total length. Can you add them? Of course not. You can't add meters and centimetres together. You need the same units. So either you convert your centimetres into metres, or vice-versa. And sometimes you want your sum to be in kilometres instead, so you end up converting both your metres and centimetres into kilometres.

In the same way, the bottom part of a fraction is like a unit. When I say 3 eighths (3/8) it is like saying 3 metres, except that instead of measuring in metres I am measuring in eighths. And when I say 3 fifths (3/5)it is like I am measuring in centimetres, except that I am measuring in fifths. So I cannot add my fractions that way. I must convert them first. 

To convert them, you would need to make that 5 become an 8 or vice-versa. Except that making a 5 become an 8 is hard and you want the easy way. Better to get your answer in units of fortieths (5*8), or what would be kilometres in our analogy. 

So you convert everything to fortieths and then add. To convert you look at the denominator in 3/5, which is 5. You want that 5 to become a 40, so you multiply the bottom by 8. However you don't want to change the value of your fraction when converting, because otherwise you are changing your measurement. It is like 3000 m = 3 km. Your numbers have changed from 3000 to 3, but their value has not. 3km is the same as 3000m.

In the same sense, when you take 3/5th and convert to fortieths, your value must remain the same. You must change your 3/5 in such a way that what you change it to is still equal to 3/5. How do you do that? Well the only way you can multiply and not change the value of something is by multiplying by 1. So in converting you must multiply by 1 but at the same time you must multiply the bottom by 8. That sounds impossible until you remember that there are many ways of writing 1. One such way is writing it as a number over itself, so 2/2 = 3/3 = 4/4 = 8/8 = 1.

Then you multiply your fraction by 8/8, so that you multiply by one, and don't change the value, and at the same time you multiply the bottom by 8. According to multiplication, you must multiply the tops together and the bottoms together. The bottom is 5 * 8 = 40, which is what we want. The top changes to 3*8 = 24. As a result you have just converted your fraction to fortieths. Do the same for 3/8, except that you now multiply by 5/5 (because this time it is 8 in the denominator) and you get 15/40. Now your fractions are both in the same units of fortieths and you can add the tops normally to get 39. 
Thus you have 39 fortieths or 39/40.

So to add two fractions you must ensure that they are in the same units, i.e denominators. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How traffic jams where you stay blocked for hours on end form. You have a lot of cars on the road, that's fine. But why on Earth is everything not moving? 

Suppose you had lines of cars. Each line when extended enough should be controlled by a traffic light. But traffic lights change every few minutes. If the line is long you will not move a lot, but you will move in those few minutes when the light is green.
So how on Earth does it happen that you can stay without moving for hours? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quantum mechanics makes sense only in maths because humans don't have this logic per se. According to Feynman and what he has done, it is perfectly possible to develop some sort of physical intuition for quantum mechanics. It will never be like Newtonian mechanics because we are literally non wired to see it that way, but the intuition does show that it does not exist only in maths.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dragon Ball?
I know GT is no more canon because of Super, but at least the old ending was terrible.
GT was at least watchable and somewhat Dragon Ball like, I did like it a bit.
But I'm talking about the GT movie. That was just about the stupidest thing I've ever seen and the worst case of screw the source material aside from evolution.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From its limit definition, you can also look at it this way:
You have one dollar in a bank, with an interest rate of 1% per annum that compounds. To compute compound money consider that you deposit a sum P( here = 1) and that you have a rate r per year(also 1 here). Suppose the number of years is n. Then after one year you have 
P + Pr   =P(1 + r)
then next year
P + 2Pr + Pr^2 = P(1 + 2r + r^2) = P(1 +r)^2
then the third year:
P + 3Pr + 3Pr^2 + Pr^3 = P(1 + r)^3
The pattern is P(1 + r)^n but we can ignore the P because it is one.

 However, you are not paid your one percent interest at the end of the year but in periods. So for example, you could be paid in two periods, i.e, every six months. You get 0.5% for the first six months, and then 0.5% on the total money you had in your bank. 

This adds up to more than if you just had all given in one go, because you get interest on your interest.So the effective rate is 1/n

The question is how to maximise your gains? Obviously, the best would be to make the periods extremely small. So small in fact, that the number of periods in one year increases to infinity. 

So you increase the number of periods, and you decrease the period length from 2 periods of six months to twelve periods of one month to 52 periods of one week and go on and on. As you go on, n will tend towards infinity. As this happens, at the end of one year where you are constantly gaining interest, your account balance would have exactly $e. This is the definition of e.

An interesting property of this definition is that if you divided a number into a certain number of equal parts, and then multiplied those parts, the value you get when your small part is e is the largest. For instance,
dividing 20 into 5 small parts gives 5 4s. 4^5 is lower than e^ whatever 20/e is.
