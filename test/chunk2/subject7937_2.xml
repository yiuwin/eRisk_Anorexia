	<TEXT> So I just beat the game for the first time. A very special experience has come to an end. The Nameless Song though. It's so wonderfully perfect to make you reminisce about the whole game. Absolutely brilliant. What was your experience when you first beat the game and heard the song for the first time?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd argue that it's not his off hand because the shoulder plate is on his left arm which means that is the arm which he used for defense. So basically he was using his correct hand throughout. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What a truly magnificent fight. Went pure melee 1v1. All the aspects of the fight are amazing. Out of all the RPGs I've ever played i must say this fight has become my favorite and will always have a corner in my heart. And yes I like to call him Sir because for me he is a true legend. 
Wish I could erase my memory to relive that fight again.   </TEXT>
