	<TEXT> (rant)Caitlyn it pisses me off to see how much hate she is getting and from here especially. She might have millions of dollars so who cares she earned that herself she did earn that not that from begin trans and its really her money she can uses how she pleases. In her show she did not know a lot about trans issues so most of us might not when we stared to but she spends the time and money to go out and learn about them as well as educating people at home. She invited other trans people with her to help her learn more that should be a good thing people are there to educate her band viewers at home. Her beging trans is making it more talked about subject witch light helped get more laws pass as an actually popular celebrity is trans and it might help with acceptance from mother people that lift have not bravos he her show educated them. How people are saying she is our queen or some crap She is more pushes to that position by the media because she is a celebrity and she does not that title either. End of rant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to the informed consent clinic in Philly the mazzoni center to my knowledge it is the closest informed consent clinic nearest to you(and me as we live pretty close). It is a good place to go they are really nice and since you live far away they will usally call in a blocker for you and then call in the sex hormone for you when the doctor is ready. This is atlest what they did for me but appt usually take around 1-2 months to get. And since you live far away they will even work with that as calling in hrt for you. </TEXT>
