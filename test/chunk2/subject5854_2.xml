* They talk a little about Stuntbrain and bring up their agent and talk about Colin Quinn and Patrice O'Neal who will both be on the show later.


**(51:10)** Second segment:


* They get into today's Jocktober which features Woody   Jim on [The River in Nashville](http://www.1075theriver.com/pages/personality_wj.html). 






* They play a bunch of clips from Woody   Jim including an intern who is "a Fez". Sam reads some of the comments being left on that show's Facebook page. 


* Very deep into the segment Opie announces that he has to tap-out because he found out he went to college with that guy Jim and started in radio with him. The Facebook comments then get worse while Opie tries to defend himself and compliment his old friend. **Colin Quinn joins them (1:42:00)** and they fill him in.

##Rundown: 

(from [oarundowns.com](http://www.struff.com/vbulletin/showthread.php/61350-9-16-10-Opie-amp-Anthony-Show-Rundown-Blind-Intern-Stevie-Ant-Watched-Death-Wish-3-Rich-Vos-amp-Bob-Kelly-in-Studio-Paralyzed-Opie-Parties-at-Ant-s-House-Stevie-s-Father-Issues))

**First hour:**


* The studio has been disinfected again because Fez was in yesterday with his boil that may or may not be MRSA.

* Opie says that management told Fez he can't come back in studio until he gets diagnosed by a doctor. Apparently there wasn't any good news yesterday since they cleaned the place again.

* They have a new bunch of interns on the show and check out Intern Stevie, who is fat and has thick glasses. They read his "bio." They see some of his "likes" (Devo, Big Country) and wonder if the kid is retarded.


* Sam explains they have told Stevie he has to come up with a new bit idea for the show every day. They read a few include a really hacky "Schlong Soda" ad.

* They invite Intern Stevie into the studio. They ask him to come up with a second hit by Big Country, and he can't. They ask if he's retarded, and he says no but he gets that a lot. He explains he has an eye condition called nystagmus which causes his eyes to wander uncontrollably. They try to test his eyesight and ask how bad it is. They have him sing "In a Big Country" a capella.

* They find out Stevie and Ant both went to the same elementary school in East Islip. Also Stevie's parents recently separated. They ask Stevie why he's still a virgin. Opie asks to see Stevie's glasses, and he sees that they're all bent and busted up. They all try on Stevie's glasses and see how horrible his vision is. He's just short of the legal limit to be able to drive a car. They have him read a list of the top 20 mean names people have called him. Some of them are ones that Sam made up. Jimmy points out that Stevie has tiny hands.

**Second hour:**


* The top one on the list is "Fat Drew Carey Motherfucker." His least bothersome of the lot #20 is "faggot." They come up with some new ones as he reads.

* They have him read the "Schlong Soda" script over a music bed. They ask if he has any broadcast experience, and he talks about going to sportscasting camp. He says when he called basketball games he couldn't tell any of the kids apart.

* Listener comments come in comparing him to Mark David Chapman and John Candy's character in Vacation

* Someone also thinks he looks like the "Warcraft guy from South Park."

* Opie offers to buy Stevie new glasses if he lets Opie shave his head like that character. He relents and says yes, but Opie has mercy and backs down.

* Sam says they also have a female and a non-white intern. Jimmy boos.


~ break ~


* They talk about Michael Grimm winning America's Got Talent the previous night. They are reminded last year's winner was Kevin Skinner, and Travis says that Skinner's album didn't crack the Billboard 200.

* They play a Kevin Skinner song and trash the lyrics.

* Caller says the million dollar prize for that show is actually paid out over 40 years.

* Anthony talks about watching Death Wish 3 last night. He says the gang leader looks like Bill Burr and everything about the film is ridiculous.

* They start watching the movie and tear it apart. Ant says it was so horrible he couldn't take his eyes off it. They reveal that the gang leader is in fact the guy who played Chuck, Richie Cunningham's older brother on Happy Days who was written out in the second season.

* Ant talks about how some guy once chicks give blowjob advice by saying they should make a Charles Bronson face so their teeth wouldn't scrape his dick.

* Jimmy says the last Death Wish movie was cancer looking for Bronson and Jill Ireland. Too soon?

* Caller says his 12-year-old son was watching last night too and thought the movie was hilarious. Ant asked if his son enjoyed the rape scene.

* They talk about the character known as the Giggler. Jimmy's face gets hot in embarrassment.


**Third hour:**

* Opie notices a lot of suits in the office today, and Jimmy quips, "There's a giant acquisition happening." Mild speculation ensues. "Is this guy coming in to fire us?"


* They play a clip of Jimmy's Raw Dog show featuring Bob Kelly talking about blowing a guy in exchange for a steak when he was young.


**Rich Vos and Bob Kelly enter the studio**


* Vos brings up hanging out at the "picnic" at Nick DiPaolo's two weeks ago, and they argue about the semantics of what you call a barbecue.

* Rich brings up Opie's messed up nose and gets off a few good lines about it. Then they tell Vos to stop immediately because he always goes one line too far and bombs when this happens. They talk about Nick's barbecue and the fact that Jimmy didn't get an invitation.

* Opie talks about being evacuated for one day for Hurricane Earl then going back after finding out it was a bust. He talks about catching a wave badly while boogeyboarding and hitting the water so hard he was afraid at first he'd literally gotten paralyzed while his wife and baby were sitting on the beach.


* Bobby talks about getting dragged by a wave in Aruba that also ripped his shorts off.

* They riff for a long time on how the show would be different if Opie had really gotten paralyzed. Ant does a Stephen Hawking voice.

* They make some references to Opie's "imagination" bomb from Tuesday. They talk about how paralyzed Opie would get his comeuppance from all the people he's abused over the years.

* Opie brings up his new gimmick of asking guys if they have ever intentionally taken a shit outside. Bobby says he did the last time he went camping, but it's not the same as Opie taking a shit on the beach. They catch Vos bombing then trying to pretend it didn't happen, so they have Travis roll back and replay the clip.

* Bobby says he has a friend in a wheelchair who rents himself out for people to take him to events so they will get priority seating.


**Fourth hour**


* They notice a cute chick outside so they invite her in. She's a NASCAR employee from L.A. named Sherri who just happened to be passing by. Opie brings up a story about Sandy Kane harrassing Kyle Busch's fiancee on their ESPN2 reality show.

* They find out Sherri is an ethnic mix of Mexican and black. They keep demanding she introduce them to Kyle Busch, but they later find out he already left the building. They mess with and flirt with her for a while, and she's a good sport about it before politely bowing out of the studio.

* Caller repeats a line of Opie's he thought was good, and Vos says "I'm glad you got through to the pandering line."

* Opie says he's dying to pick his nose, but he's afraid to because he knows someone in the room would catch him on camera.

* Vos may or may not be doing a show Friday because it's his and Bonnie's anniversary. They talk about Uncle Vinnie's in Staten Island which Bobby says is really beautiful; Vos and Jimmy say they haven't played that area in years. Vos talks about going to the "dime district" to trade in some jewelry, and they boo Travis when he isn't able to instantly pull the audio clip for them to replay. They tease Vos for promoting how good the food is a the club he's going to be at. They start piling onto Vos for a few minutes and get on a roll. Finally Chip chimes in to completely step on the moment.


~ break ~


* After having made a quick phone call, Vos announces he won't be playing a show on his anniversary after all.

* Vos wants to talk politics and asks whether Republicans or Democrats did better in the primaries. Ant points out that's a retarded question because both parties are just selecting their candidates. Vos strikes back with some shots about Ant gettin gized(typo?) during his own house party. Ant recaps the story for Bobby's benefit. It frequently derails into more jabs at each other.

* Bobby asks what parties are like at Ant's house because he's never been. They mention naked girls in the pool at Keith's birthday party, and Vos asks "were they hot or your fans?" They riff for a while on girls with "one fuckable quality." They talk about pissing in a jacuzzi and whether it's worse than shitting on the beach.


* They talk about MacFarlane's Red Dead Redemption and how there's a character coincidentally has the same name as Bonnie. 

* They mention Ron Bennington doing a voice in the game   some of them whine that they've never been asked to do any voices.


* They talk about Vos' dentures. Bobby says "someone went to school to make your mouth." Ant tells Bobby, "someone bought a steak to make your mouth."



**Fifth hour:**


* They bring Blind Stevie back into the studio and immediately rip on his looks. Sam explains that Stevie's been working on a new bit. They ask him some questions about his eyesight. Stevie says he has a bit of "OCD like Anthony" to which Anthony objects.

* There's some more sparring between Vos and Bobby, but it turns back on Stevie again.

 *Opie asks to see Stevie's glasses again. When he hands them to Opie, everyone gets really worried for the kid but nothing happens.

* Opie asks Stevie to talk about his father, but Stevie's not comfortable with the subject. Bobby and Ant share father-issue stories with Stevie to try to draw him out. They can barely get through it without taking more shots at each other. Stevie talks about his dad taking him to see a iRocky/i movie on a school night then wanting to theater-hop into another screen and beating Stevie to the ground when he refused. They ask Stevie to re-enact the scene with Sam. Stevie says he hasn't spoken to his dad since he moved out last October. They talk about it for a bit then start to tear into each other again. They never even get to the bit Stevie was working on, but they have him read Vos and Bobby's plugs on the air. They heckle as he stumbles through it then say goodbye.

Opie put out a tweet like 15min ago, lets tweet Opie positive encouragement to comment on the situation and pretend we are all coming back to him because we're turned off from that nasty Anthony guy. Even if we get a tiny little side comment, it's all we need to keep this fire going </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anthony bringing up Opie post-GS2 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-16 07:20:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Today Anthony made a reference that for 20 years he had anxiety about going to his job, also made the same joke he made last time which was "20 years... well almost 20... 19 1/2... I had a good 6 months" he just made this joke like 2 days ago. He's made reference to this 20 year hell and yet never once did we get to hear anything about it except for times that Opie started up the fight. I don't really find that much sympathy for him getting rich during that 20 years doing a radio show, maybe it was really bad with Opie, but hashing that out could've made for good radio, especially early on in the XM days if it really was 20 years of hell. For all of the shit that Jim Norton has gotten, it took him about a year before he called Opie straight out on the air and was relentless about a few criticisms he had for him.

I don't want to see Anthony start relying on Opie beatups for good segments. Things that Opie did around the time of the firing and afterwards, or any time he bitches out like a couple weeks ago I love it, it's finally someone saying exactly what everyone in Opie's world is too afraid or not dumb enough to say right to him due to the professional consequences. But today seemed forced, and nothing really provoked it. The awkwardness from the guests didn't really help and yet there isn't much for them to say, it's not like they have a lot of great insight into Opie and Anthony's 20 year relationship, so they just sat there and listened to him. The guests in general sucked on that episode but even if it was Colin sitting there what's he supposed to say to that?

Then he does the same thing that Opie does. He talks shit about him and brings up good memories in nearly the same sentence. A few minutes later he was talking about a Christmas party and specifically brought up a story with Opie in it, not really in a bad light, it seemed like he was remembering it fondly. Opie did the same thing all morning today, bringing up old bits with Anthony, talking about Ant during Sleeves and some other Christmas stuff. It's all just weird and plays out like two scorned lovers or like 2 estranged brothers who fight. They should just get over it and make total amends. What's the point of all of this and where is it going, other than to keep the listeners engaged and keep the old Opie and Anthony fanbase coming back to see what's up... Opie has said before he doesn't want the old fans following him anywhere, so I doubt he brings anything up unless forced to, and if Anthony on Periscope or Ant on some of these TACS episodes doesn't get him to talk, he's just not going to. Eventually it will become obvious that Ant is trying to get his attention and IMO he shouldn't even bother, the show is good without it </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Stern / Artie fans -- All 6 chapters of The Complete Artie Lange Addiction Saga by WDM are going up on YouTube now </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-15 06:54:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, 

I noticed that this production was on YouTube, but it's chopped up into 30 parts due to the old YouTube video length restrictions, the guide isn't included with it, and on the last video, there's a bunch of commenters asking the uploader to finish the file, but there's nothing after it.

So in order to do this presentation the justice it deserves, here is the whole thing up in the original 6 chapters with the guide that WDM included. Timestamps in the video description will be coming eventually, going to kick back and get into this again myself, haven't heard it in awhile.

It's an incredible piece of audio, it spans 24 hours of audio over 5 years of the show and includes dozens and dozens of clips in chronological order, telling the story of Artie's downfall on the show from prominent sidekick comedian to completely off the show and never to return. It was made in 2010 by wushdishmeen.

(P.S. the introduction is quite lengthy, the quick intro narration then show audio gets started about 3-5 minutes in if you don't want to wait)

* [Chapter 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_nyLBWgSbA)

* [Chapter 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF2TpOoT_cM)

* [Chapter 3](https://youtu.be/uHpblqG6TjM)

* [Chapter 4](https://youtu.be/mQu2zEsrXSI) * audio muted! this is a new link to a re-upload that will be playable probably in an hour or 2

* [Chapter 5](https://youtu.be/F_bJN5omhCo) 

* [Chapter 6 (Conclusion)](https://youtu.be/jV8v04A80vs)

[Playlist link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-fjt7LgQx7801rzcOJvtGkLKXr8L76nQ)

[Here is the original listening guide](http://pastebin.com/wVCJsKXz)

There are torrents for the 128K version active and I am seeding it at the moment too, as are several people. I'll post links to directly download these MP3s after the uploads finish but if you don't want to wait, the file's still out there.

Anyways it's a great listen and clearly a lot of hard work was put into it. If you've never heard it you're in for a treat! :) </TEXT>

Summer sausage is my preference but pepperoni seems to be more common. Mmm and the combinations of cracker type, cheese type, and even cured meat type is endless... a great combo that should not just be taken for granted as a casual party appetizer, it should be celebrated as a simple to prepare and yet very complex combination of tastes and a huge variety of flavor profiles.

	<TITLE> Back muscle knot pain and symptoms themselves helped out a ton by kratom </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-09 20:28:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> God damn I woke up with all of my lower back muscles twisted all up into knots, I don't know why I have this issue but it started developing a few years ago. I tried to fix up my posture, I've lost a lot of weight when I was between 20-21, and am in good shape now, 27, but if I don't keep myself constantly loose and constantly moving and running and stuff, everything just knots up and locks up, I can crack different parts of my back like 200 times a day, and even just moving or breathing sometimes will move little muscles or bones around in there to where I can hear them. A year or two ago I went and had all of the Xrays and all of that stuff done to see what was up and everyhing somehow came back normal..

This morning was a pain in the fucking ass I woke up twisted.. just this sharp numb pain where there are these huge knots forcing my back out of alignment and there's not much I can do.


Well I took about 2 teaspoons of kratom and in about 15 minutes... dear god... everything just feels so much better. Once the pain starts to subside, my body feels less stress, and due to this, the muscles start to loosen the tension in themselves. It's almost like a cycle that creates itself that both lessens the pain and "heals" the symptom, to a small degree.

$60 and I have enough of this stuff for months... no prescriptions or doctors or any of that needed. I don't think it would be a be all end all to pain problems but just for what I have, it's a GODSEND. This post is just in appreciation of Kratom </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The WNEW era archive is pretty close to being done barring a few extra videos. Next up is working on putting all of the FoundryMusic ~2006-2009 videos in one big channel or archive. These are where they originally were uploaded:

https://web.archive.org/web/20090131231501/http://www.foundrymusic.com/opieanthony/media.cfm/opieanthony/media.cfm

however the actual video links don't work unfortunately. I've had mostly good luck searching each of them on YouTube so far, but if you have anything from this era please send it to this email address:

oavideoarchive@outlook.com


or if anyone is bored and wants to help put it together, I just copy paste some video titles on Google/Youtube, if anything comes up download them, if you find any links for them just post here or email works. If you have anything from those 28 pages of videos or anything else that isn't there, but you think would fit that era, and is video related from O A or friends just lemme know it will all go in. I'll include all the sources in the Special Thanks too

After this era, opie started doing opieradio on YouTube, so it's pretty much all covered past that, and frankly not worth archiving anyways. He turned the O A video feed into his own personal video twitter which kinda sucked compared to the WNEW / Foundry vids. But Steve C was holding him back from going viral so it's understandable. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From every report that's come out and comments on the air etc. it seems like $750,000 is a minimum figure at which Opie is paid, and it's probably over that.

Part of the reason to pay him so much though, actually the ONLY reason, is that he was part of a brand that was worth it because it would bring enough subscribers to pay them all of that money and then still profit nicely.

However that fanbase is split now. Opie was not hired because of his talent or his ability to do great radio, the brand was hired and brought on, and not to mention, Sirius was the home of Howard Stern, and bringing O A in wasn't exactly celebrated as the greatest thing ever from what we've heard here and there on the show.

So all that being said -- $750,000 -- not for the Opie and Anthony brand -- not even for the majority of it. Just for *Opie*. One of the most hated figures in radio. Bobby/Vos have flat out admitted that doing the show is only good for selling tickets, it's not good for self esteem, and anyone associated with it gets shit on.


Think about this -- Sirius could fire Opie completely. Cut out 1 million in expenses. Hire 4 new radio people for $100k each, hire a producer or two for another $120,000.

Now here's the best part, KEEP SAM! Sam moves to the morning with Whoo kid and Nicole, and now you have a multi-racial, multicultural, young blood radio show again. Sirius XM booking does the rest, Whoo Kid and Sam already have grown a decent amount of connections themselves.   I'm not trying to say this will be good for anyone on reddit's ears, but it could be good for Sirius XM's pockets. How many people really subscribe only for OPIE? At this point, these people have had their Sirius XM subscription for years and they probably use it for lots of other reasons like Sports etc. There are also several options that do Dad/Mom Radio way better than Opie and they're already available on SXM. They probably won't even get hit with a big cancellation wave at all, espeically if it becomes obvious beforehand that Norton is out of the picture past October. So now you have a catch that will keep some O A fan hanger-ons subscribing. Kill off the dead weight, shed themselves from the internet outrage, cut out hundreds of thousands in show expenses, and reinvigorate the channel with a young vibe again. Opie is done. </TEXT>

Remember -- Anthony sued or is suing Sirius XM for the remainder of his contract's salary, saying that there wasn't an adequate reason to terminate his employment.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking over the subreddit today, tons of posts! I scrolled down to around 8AM to get started with the day.

Now this is when most people who subscribe to this subreddit are getting up, or at least the others who aren't are probably checking in to see how the show etc. is going. I looked down and there are at least 10-20 threads from about 6-10AM.

Reading through all of them I noticed that no one even bothered to say good morning to each other. Not even in the listening thread when we are all getting up together to listen to the show. The first post in the listening thread says "Meh". I had all of these great posts I thought of this morning but reading that? I don't even want to share a single one of them with you guys. No one even said it in any side comment. How are we supposed to have fun doing the subreddit without knowing where each other stand? How am I supposed to know how to post to you guys if I don't know what mood you're in... it's making it impossible to browse this sub.

I'm trying to move to a more positive place in my life lately and you guys are making it really hard. I mean if you're not happy to be here on the subreddit, why post? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Breaking the Narcissist </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-23 09:04:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *note: This was originally written for divorce lawyers dealing with a narcissistic personality type on the stand.*

It is very easy to break a narcissist  even a well-trained and well-prepared one.

Here are a few of the things the narcissist finds devastating:

* Any statement or fact, which seems to contradict his inflated perception of his grandiose self. 

* Any criticism, disagreement, exposure of fake achievements, belittling of talents and skills which the narcissist fantasises that he possesses. 

* Any hint that he is subordinated, subjugated, controlled, owned or dependent upon a third party. 

* Any description of the narcissist as average and common, indistinguishable from many others.
 
* Any hint that the narcissist is weak, needy, dependent, deficient, slow, not intelligent, naive, gullible, susceptible, not in the know, manipulated, a victim, an average person of mediocre accomplishments. 

The narcissist is likely to react with rage to all these and, in an effort to re-establish his fantastic grandiosity, he is likely to expose facts and stratagems he had no conscious intention of exposing. The narcissist reacts indignantly, with wrath, hatred, aggression, or even overt violence to any infringement of what he perceives to be his natural entitlement. 

Narcissists believe that they are so unique and that their lives are of such cosmic significance that others should defer to their needs and cater to their every whim without ado. The narcissist feels entitled to interact or be treated (or questioned) only by unique individuals. He resents being doubted and ridiculed. Any insinuation, hint, intimation, or direct declaration that the narcissist is not special at all, that he is average, common, not even sufficiently idiosyncratic to warrant a fleeting interest inflame the narcissist. He holds himself to be omnipotent and omniscient.

Tell the narcissist that he does not deserve the best treatment, that his desires are not everyones priority, that he is boring or ignorant, that his needs can be catered to by any common practitioner (medical doctor, accountant, lawyer, psychiatrist), that he and his motives are transparent and can be easily gauged, that he will do what he is told, that his temper tantrums will not be tolerated, that no special concessions will be made to accommodate his inflated sense of self, that he is subject to court procedures, etc.  and the narcissist will likely lose control.

The narcissist believes that he is the cleverest, far above the madding crowd.

Contradict him often, disagree with him and criticize his judgement, expose his shortcomings, humiliate and berate him (You are not as intelligent as you think you are, Who is really behind all this? It takes sophistication which you dont seem to posses , So, you have no formal education, You are (mistake his age, make him much older), What did you do in your life? Did you study? Do you have a degree? Did you ever establish or run a business? Would you define yourself as a success?, Would your children share your view that you are a good father?, You were last seen with a certain Ms.  who is (suppressed grin) a stripper (in demeaning disbelief).

I know that many of these questions cannot be asked outright in a court of law. But you can insinuate them or hurl these sentences at him during the breaks, inadvertently during the examination or deposition phase, etc. Narcissists hate innuendos even more than they detest direct attacks.

	<TITLE> WTW for what a vigilante hacker represents in the overall scheme of different societal groups? More inside. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-21 02:58:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a weird one I'll try to explain, not sure if anyone will be able to help but let's see.

I'm trying to find a more official word, if one is available, for what groups like anonymous and Ghost security represent right now, instead of calling them hackers or anything like that. I'm sort of trying to apply a more old fashioned, formal word to it.

Here's my sentence:

* It's rare to see this type of cooperation between law enforcement, the private sector, and *******

the ****** = the word or phrase that I want to use to represent all the vigilante hacker groups. 

Is there maybe a synonym for something like "the outside" or "the outliers" that might apply for the situation?

Really freaking weird post, but thought I'd give it a try. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-11-10 01:57:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If there's any other late 20s / early 30s people on here this might be a trip down middle / high school memory lane. In the early 2000s alt rock kind of hit a peak, not sure it's really been as big as those days since the mid 2000s when hardcore and the various "core" offshoots really hit a boom and beyond that. It's still definitely well represented, but it used to be on TRL, was the theme music for the Spiderman movie, every gaming montage back in the day had songs like this in them. It had a bit of a renaissance for sure. 

Here are some examples that might spark your memory up to get us started if anyone feels like joining in! Any sort  of alt rock, pop rock, or pop-punk rock from the early 2000s welcome :)

	<TEXT> Kind of a noob question but something is confusing me about this, I went to get my usual .3 Atlantis coils, which I can vape up to 80 watts without burning cotton, and the coil also says that it goes up to 80 watts on it.

They didn't have .3 though so I got a .4.. however it says on this coil that the wattage range is 25-30w ...

I have .5 coils for my subtank though that go up to 45-50 without burning so it just seems weird to me that .4 would be 25-30w. If anyone with a higher level of knowledge could clear this one up I would greatly appreciate it </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-11-04 16:48:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't mean to be super negative or annoying but I've just been thinking about this a little bit and want to blow off the steam somewhere.

This company charges $15 a month for streaming only... yes, they do have other plans, but pretend you are someone who has no idea about Sirius XM, no idea that they have other plans, pretend you're not even looking for them at all.. and go to the website and see what it's like to sign up. These plans have to be found, they don't hit you with options immediately, they want people to pay for the $15 a month so they streamline that registration... therefore at first impression, this company looks to a curious buyer, that it costs $15 a month *just* to stream.

Yet you can sign up for a free 30 days of streaming within 5 minutes and once the email comes with your password you're listening for free for 30 days. So what am I going to do, pay $15 a month for something I listen to 2-3 hours a day (and if I miss the time slot, personally I don't use it at all because people upload my favorite show to YouTube within an hour of it airing) or just spend 10 minutes of my time signing up and fixing up a new trial account every 30 days?

Now in this day and age, you can stream Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Pandora, and several other premium music / movies / TV services for under $10. Sirius is asking $15 a month for radio channels where you don't even get to choose or customize anything about them you just have to listen to whatever comes on... and a lot of them still have commercials.

So maybe the only reason left to subscribe to Sirius is for the premium talk... what exactly is the shelf life on that? Howard Stern was a titan of radio, he changed the face of Sirius. Opie and Anthony, while not on Stern's level, carries a loyal cult like fanbase that XM knew was going to without a doubt, no speculation needed, get them a massive subscriber boost.. and being that they're still there 10 years later, clearly it did. Oprah, Ellen, and several other big names always bring a boost to subscribers but they're gone as quickly as the name/show is. Plus, it's the age of having your own little podcast studio somewhere and broadcasting whenever you feel like it, instead of answering to a company who wants to own all of your material etc. How much longer Sirius can really cut deals with these big names and keep them from just starting their own podcast, IMO, is limited.

But now you have tons of professional quality podcasts with WAY bigger fanbases that Bonfire, Race Wars, any of the "come-up" shows that Sirius XM is grooming has. Those shows are not going to pull in or keep subscribers. Not to mention the fact that some of these shows are uploaded in full (with video) to YouTube, so there's no point in buying a service to just hear it.

TL;DR -- The only thing competitive about SXM left is the premium talk channels who are already holding on to fanbases that aren't going to go away.. but once those shows go away, there's practically not a single thing Sirius XM has left to compete with the newer, customizable, cheaper entertainment platforms. The days are numbered and once Howard announces his retirement, if anyone's crazy enough to still have SXM stock, cut your losses and sell quick... it's over for this company

	<TEXT> I'm not in the throes of a clinical depression like some of you guys are currently facing, I have reasons to be down and things that I can fix to make the it go away, which in my opinion is a different type of affliction that someone who is facing some brutal demons that attack them no matter what's going on in their lives at the time.

So I can't say this is a cure all but it's something I noticed. Any time I wake up feeling sick in my stomach, sweating, nervous, everything feels dark and cold and there is absolutely nothing appealing about facing the world... one sip of coffee and seriously, I start to perk right up. My whole brain chemistry feels like it changes when the coffee hits my lips. It's warm and comforting and wakes you up.

It's not going to put a smile on your face all day, it's not liquid effexor, but it adds just enough zing to the morning to help me continuously get out the door to where I need to go. 

There are some downsides, too much coffee = anxiety. Especially when you drink it all day long and keep gulping down big cups of it one by one. The best way to have coffee I've found, is to simply have one mug of it -- commuter cups full of coffee might be too much if you're using it to kick yourself out of a depressive funk in the morning or whenever. Have one mug, see how it feels, and then when you feel like it's worn totally off and you want another, go for it. But overall I've had bad results by chain drinking all day.

Just a tip for anyone looking for something to add to their day or consider for a little boost or some pep in your step again. </TEXT>

Then in 2009 O A coincidentally defend Rob Arnie and Dawn when they faced some politcal correctness hubbub

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ1IXi7jWRY

6 years later Jim and Louis, without naming their show or seeming to have any memory of the jocktober/defense of the show, start trashing it and talking about how shitty it is to be on there:

To show that it's the show Jim and Louis were talking about here is a clip of it, it's pretty awful too

Now to get really wacky with it, hear how Louis CK said "maybe he committed suicide"...

He actually did attempt suicide very recently to that:

	<TITLE> The Comedy Death of Joe DeRosa - A Complete Guide to the 8-month-long Anthony Cumia vs. Joe DeRosa Fallout </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-01 01:49:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ##For your entertainment this weekend, here is a FULL guide to Anthony Cumia and Joe DeRosa's 8 month long fallout and feud, all packed into one YouTube video!

In this 3 hour saga, you will be witness to the downfall of a 7 year member of the Opie   Anthony family, and the unforgiving sendoff he got when he was written off as a bad friend to Ant at best, and a traitor to the show at worst. 

   You can be certain; this tale of treachery has no shortage of action, drama, suspense, tragedy, professional relationships going up in smoke, black friends getting mad, white friends not knowing what to say, a years-long friendship between two comics heavily damaged, comedy specials getting bombarded with 1-star reviews, a shirtless Bobo, and much, much more.

 Which, you will see, mostly amounts to Anthony kicking back and cracking jokes in his basement, watching from the sidelines as the ever-faithful pests launch a full scale internet assault on DeRosa throughout the winter. An olive branch is inevitably extended by one party, and quickly swiped away by the other, further lessening the chance for a reconciliation. 

Eventually after months of thrashing, we hear from DeRosa on comedian Alison Rosen's podcast. DeRosa uses a listener question about O J as an opportunity to re-tell his side of the story, in detail, from the initial JRE appearance on 9/10/15 to his present day (which was 5/25/15) 


Many of these clips you may have already seen or heard, but hopefully there are a few new ones in there too. or perhaps some you forgot about!

**NOTE:** These videos are collected from different sources and not leveled in volume.The O J on Sirius XM clip is a lower volume than the others, and the TACS clips from September 24th-May 25th are the loudest.

P.S. -- Made in Windows Movie Maker so it might be a little rough, but it's all there!-- If I missed any rants / shots taken / mentions from anyone involved on other podcasts/radio shows please let me know. There was a part on TACS where Norton says DeRosa was supposedly continuing to talk about this on other podcasts but besides the Rosen one (which was way after he mentioned that) I couldn't find any.

	<TEXT> Anthony has given us amazing radio for years and years, the YouTube clips live on forever as a nearly endless source of entertainment.

He was booted off of Sirius as we all know and he is trying to get a podcast network off the ground.

Occasionally he comes on reddit and talks to people who are criticizing the show. He does care about what we say and faces us head on no matter how vile some of the stuff here can be he still jumps in the lion's den wearing a meat suit. 

He really cares about what we say and he is making a serious effort to get the show off the ground. We wanted him to do something better than a basement podcast and he invested in it enough to open an NYC studio, that can't be cheap. 

So my main point is that even if you don't watch his show, or don't like where it is with the direction of it etc, if you want to show some support for a guy who delivered us great entertainment for years and is actively trying to improve a show that he's relying directly on us to fund... 7 dollars a month out of the checking account isn't too bad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lots of his friends are in L.A. now, or it seems like it from the friends that we know he has, that Carmody girl is there, he has a possibility of turning a new leaf on his whole career and you never know what could happen for him. 

I think it's obvious by listening to both shows that both Anthony and Opie are passing him by as broadcasters. Opie is trying to do a guest interview based, vanilla talk show for middle age dads, and Anthony is building a semi-right wing network with Gavin, who Jimmy doesn't seem to get along with... I don't think Jimmy would really fit in that well with the direction TACS is going to be honest. The best option for him would be to free himself from all contracts involving both shows, he can appear as a regular guest on either, and he can try to catch a second wind on his career on the west coast. It seems like the overall most efficient way to keep building his career while not burning any bridges or continuing to be hated by fans for not doing more. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Remember a few weeks ago when we were discussing the Louis CK   Ricky Gervais vs. Jay Mohr appearance? Finally found the precursor to that interview. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-26 01:34:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So it starts at about 2:50:00, 20 minutes until the show ends. No Anthony in studio - Jay Mohr, Ronnie B, Jim Norton, Opie, and then Louis CK.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmdhAlp8goM t=2h50m00s

Louis CK comes in the studio alone. They didn't know he was going to make an appearance.

After like 5-10 minutes of pleasantries and stories, the bashing starts. Eventually Louis goes after Mohr and tells him he has the mind of a dog. It's a matter of opinion so feel free to share yours but it seemed to me like that comment rubbed Jay the wrong way. His energy changed after it. He kind of had a "pouty" tone in his voice when he made comments after the Louis bashing of him. Perhaps this appearance played a lot into the following appearance and the followup phone call.

Now at the last 5 minutes of the clip -- listen to Jay Mohr ask Louis questions. I'm pretty sure he was subtly trolling him. At one point he just sets Louis up with this softball ass question and says something about "autonomy" -- Hollywood Louis eats it right up and doesn't even notice he's being made fun of. I think Jim Norton noticed it though because he seemed to catch on to what Jay was doing.

Also, dare I say that Opie is pretty good throughout the whole segment. This was during a 2 week span when Anthony wasn't in studio at all, and Opie actually had some good shows in that period, heavily supported by jim / ronnie b / jay / bobby etc. Opie is a good shit stirrer in this clip. IMO.

Also near the beginning is Louis CK talking about Twitter. He talks about the exact risk of twitter that caused Anthony to lose his job 

edit: 

dog comment is around 3:02:00

autonomy question is around 3:07:15 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the description it would simply read that the amount of money shown in the box to the right is more or less a political bounty. It will be rewarded to whatever politician spearheads the campaign for what we want. Then every person, company, and/or organization who wants that legislation to happen can donate to the pot.

The politician or group of politicians will then present a case to the crowdfunders to show them that he/she accomplished their goal, and everyone who donated on the campaign can vote if the politican deserves the money in return.

Is it ethical? No. How our political system was meant to work? Definitely not. But that's basically the game these huge companies / banks are playing nowadays so let's play too.

The smiles before they went on... I would kill to be able to hear that muted audio before the show. 

I think the biggest piece of evidence that shows how Opie handled this was one of the first things he said. 

11:45 - With a smile he says "Look at what they're doing, they're already tearing the names down outside the hall, changed the name of the channel, they're redoing the studio etc."

This shows that Opie did not fight for Anthony one little bit, it's concrete evidence of it. If Opie was fighting for Anthony, this company would not be putting up new logos or changing the studio. It's clear they were already preparing for the Opie Radio show way before Opie went on the air that morning.  If he was really fighting for Anthony then they would not be renovating anything or changing anything because it would be up in the air who's going to staff the show.

The smiles all morning... ugh, infuriating. It's blaringly obvious that jealousy and resentment was building for over a decade inside Opie and he finally had his chance to validate all of the jealous feelings and thinking he's better than Anthony by blowing right past him and using his mess-up as a way to boot him off of the show Machiavelli style. 

What a dirtbag

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I want to release a free album of music, and I am hoping to get a good amount of downloads on it. I signed up a new account on Bandcamp for the project and noticed that I'm only allowed 200 downloads to distribute. I'm not exactly sure how many downloads that I'll get, it might be like 50, but one time I posted a track on a few different places and because it did pretty well, it got 16,000 plays in 1 day.  Not to do too much wishful thinking like it's going to happen again, but I also don't want to be in a position where it gets a little steam and then I'm out of downloads for people. I see that you can buy more but it's like $60 for 1,000 downloads. If I could find a decent platform that will present my music in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and well organized like Bandcamp does, I would definitely use it.

I was thinking of Soundcloud but if I'm not mistaken the users have to download tracks individually. So I figured if anyone had any suggestions for Bandcamp alternatives this would be the place to come. </TEXT>

Anthony is on his way out of the studio, you can just make out his voice a little bit going "Oh no" and Jimmy was about to go out to be searching for Sally Fields to get a photo and autograph with her. Anthony then escapes before getting sucked into the vortex. Jimmy goes out to look for Sally Fields but he ends up not being as lucky.

Then... Gary cracks the Greggshells. He asks to meet with Opie outside off the air as the show was ending... Opie is not very pleased. The show deteriorates into Greggshells mode quickly... bonus is audio of Opie saying that everything should be talked about on the air </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-10-20 17:14:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been on a nostalgia trip lately playing WoW on a TBC private server. It's a lot of fun but I'd like to play something more current, with more players, and experience something new. Also WoW just seems a little overwhelming now with all of the extra expansions, level caps, spells, raids etc, and how there's that whole thing where you have a little house/base of your own.. I would like to do something totally new instead.

I'm not super knowledgeable of the MMORPG world anymore so I figured the best place to ask would be here. If you have any suggestions on currently popular MMORPGs that have a similar gameplay feel to WoW I'd love to hear it!

By similar to WoW I mean with a smooth interface where it can almost feel like an action game. The games that are heavily click-to-move aren't very much my thing. Other than that any type of setting / theme / leveling style can be different, I'm open to that.

TL;DR -- Looking for a current game that feels similar to WoW with the smooth WASD / hotkey interface, something new that has a lot of players on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Found this interesting... I can't say I care much but I'm a sucker for some good drama, and it's definitely another side to the story, coming from at least 3 different names and separate incidents of his alleged fuckery:

This was a GREAT week. Appearances by Bob Kelly as third mic nearly every day during the week, Colin, Jay Mohr, Otto, Vos on the phone, several other guests etc throughout the week too. Jimmy and Ant don't take the show seriously at all, a few times IIRC they rip on callers and the whole idea of having callers, I'm not sure when it happens but I do remember Wackbag thinking it was a subtle shot at Opie by A J pretty much saying callers are awful while he wasn't there. and the week ends with the Cherry Darts contest!

If you like Nopie shows this week is definitely going to be up your alley! Enjoy

^ ---------- That never happened

No tweets or anything about it from Gavin.

I sat and listened to the entire Race Wars, waiting to see if he popped in and he never did. Ended up being extremely boring IMO.

Any story on it from anyone involved in the situation? Kurt Metzger wasn't there either. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Opie and Anthony shower thought - The reason why all hope is lost on a reunion </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-14 02:34:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I realized something that made me sad in the shower today.    
 
There was a thread a few days ago where Opie and Anthony were talking in the street, Ant in his escalade and Opie talking to him with the camera. 

We all got sad with the thought that these two are so distant and far from friendly now, the show is a distant memory at this point.

Some people were talking about comedians reuniting O A. Rogan tried to do it but it didn't work out. None of the other guys really gave it a go to get them back together, especially not Jimmy.

I was thinking to myself who was the one force that could reunite Opie and Anthony? Who had enough power of influence to at least convince these guys to get back in a studio together, if that person wanted? Who was the one guy that all of the other comedians would have easily rallied around, making a campaign to get the beef squashed?

Well I'll give you three hints. He's big, he's black, and he's dead. That was the one guy who could've easily gotten these two back. Remember all the old shows how people would talk about Patrice being on the phone with them constantly? I think Burr or someone said that they'd fallen asleep while Patrice was talking woken back up and he's still talking or something like that. Patrice would've been hounding those two off air, perhaps even on air to talk again.

These guys aren't going to rally around Bob Kelly or Worm Norton giving his 2 cents on twitter here and there. But everyone would have backed Patrice had he tried to get these two back together. Without Patrice, the chances of the old crew convincing O A to ever talk again is pretty much lost. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How much do we actually know about the 'Mind's Eye'? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-09 11:48:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think the Mind's Eye is one of the most interesting mysteries of life. I know it's not really a scientific term and more of a new-age hippy term, but whatever word you want to use, obviously there's something going on there. Possibly the most interesting mystery of them all. The fact that we can see images in our head, but our head is just a big complex piece of electrical meat, it literally blows my mind. 

Do we know how the Mind's Eye works? Where it comes from, how it occurs? Has anyone ever had some sort of accident or trauma where they "became blind" in their Mind's Eye? Do we know anything about other animals and if they have this ability? 

If we don't have the research... what is the outlook for it? Have we even figured out how to tackle the phenomenon? ... or does science just plan to leave it alone and assume it's some sort of magic God power?

Any insight would be more than welcome. </TEXT>
