	<TITLE> The Dhampir revamped </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-24 07:23:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [race]

A while ago I created a Dhampir conversion for fifth edition and shared it with the community. A lot of feedback was given. (mostly about my work being unbalanced crap.) I have weeded out the features that most folks agreed were the worst and replaced them with features that make are a tad more mundane. 

I would like some feedback on my newest version. 


Dhampir
The child of a living human and a vampire. 

The life of a dhampir is a walk along the thin line separating life and death. Not truly dead and yet not truly alive the life force of a dhampir is one difficult to comprehend. Though dhampir do not need blood to survive, feeding on the life fluid of the living invigorates them like nothing else. 
Sometimes, the sight of blood (after not consuming it for a lengthy period) can drive a dhampir into a frenzy.  Some have trained themselves to only feast upon the blood of animals while others have fallen to their most primal instincts and behave much like their monstrous parentage. 
 While the dhampir do not possess the same weaknesses as their vampiric parent, they still experience the remnants of them. 
A Dhampir will be partially blinded in the sunlight. Dhampir can cross running water, but they feel uncomfortable while doing so. 

SIZE 
your size is medium

AGE 
dhampir mature at the same rate as humans but can live to be as old as 300

LANGUAGES 
You speak common and one extra language of your choice. 

ABILITY SCORE MOD
+2 strength or dexterity 
+1 to charisma


DARK VISION 
You can see in the dark up to 120 feet but also have disadvantage on all attack rolls and perception checks that require sight while in direct sunlight. 

UNDEAD HERITAGE 

You are resistant to necrotic damage. 

FANGS
When grappling a creature or within 5 feet of an incapacitated creature you may bite as an attack.  You are proficient with this natural weapon and if successful it does 1 + your str or dex modifier piercing damage. 

DRAIN

If you use your action on a turn to bite a creature, you may suck it's blood as a bonus action. Roll one of your hit die and add your constitution modifier. You deal the total in necrotic damage to the target. You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. You do not regain the spent hit die until you finish a long rest. 

Charming eyes

You learn the spell "Friends" and can cast it without material components. The creature you cast it on must be able to see your eyes for the spell to be cast. Charisma is your spell casting ability for it.  </TEXT>

If so, please explain to me why a thriving industry can't be allowed to farm whale and dolphin but food that you're used to in America is fine. If you are one of those "ethical vegetarian" PETA fucks, please go to one of your protests so you can continue to accomplish nothing.  </TEXT>
