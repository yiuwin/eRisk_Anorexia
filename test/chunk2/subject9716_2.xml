	<TEXT> Yeah, that's the thing. Just like any form of education, it would have to come with some aspect of entertainment in order for any adult to willingly consume it.

Kids and adolescents may be the ideal audience then, but maybe on a lighter scale  for teaching about bullying, growing up in a foreign culture, or learning how people their age grew up in other time periods. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> With VR on the rise, could a range of "Empathy Simulators" be imminent? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Every person has a unique bias, usually based on their interests, but also on how they were raised, their personal wealth, ethnicity, preferences, and so on. No matter how open-minded or even-handed we are, we will always be the sum of our experiences and form our worldview based on that.

VR presents us with a new kind of experience, because it literally puts us in another's shoes.

You could suggest that other video games already do this. You could also say that reading an autobiography accomplishes this, because we're experiencing the author's story through their eyes. 

Where those fall short is the level of immersion that VR brings to the table. 

I think it's safe to assume that most VR games will be played from the first person perspective, and these will be games where the baseline of the experience is that you should feel as if you're actually in the game's environment.

**I think sooner or later, we will start to see game developers exploit this in an effort to teach users life lessons in empathy.** 

To what extent these will be popular or marketable, I'm not sure. They may end up as just a meme, similar to how the ["Walking In NYC as a Woman"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A) video was when it made headlines 2 years ago. 

But the perspective doesn't necessarily need to be one of someone who is trying to put a spotlight on social issues. It could be the perspective of someone who has a lot of material wealth but works all the time, or someone living a primitive life in a remote tribal community.

There are any number of ways we could explore those lives, because there are any number of ways to live your life, and yet we're normally only limited to the one we have. I'm genuinely curious to find out what the level of response would be.

*edit:* wanted to expand on my last point so it didn't seem like I was trying to force this down an exclusively SJW path </TEXT>

	<TITLE> DAE experience this issue with the Blu-Ray collection? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I got the [Blu-Ray collection](https://www.amazon.com/Cowboy-Bebop-Complete-Wendee-Lee/dp/B00NP06DJE/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv ie=UTF8 qid=1483477719 sr=1-1 keywords=cowboy+bebop) from Amazon last month, and I'm experiencing a very irritating issue where the menu volume is very loud and the episode volume is very quiet. 

I *am* running my Blu-Ray player through a Bose sound system, but nothing else that it's hooked up to (my TV, Gamecube, Chromecast or Apple TV) has any volume issues whatsoever, nor have any other Blu-Ray's I've used with it had problems.

The volume of the menu and episodes seem slightly closer together on the second disc, which makes me hope the final discs will be better as well. 

I can deal with it, but I was mostly curious to find out if I got a defective set, or if everyone giving this 5 stars just REALLY loves the show enough to ignore it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those unaware, this is what she wanted written in her obituary.

'Wishful Drinking' really broadened my perception of her and growing up in Hollywood in general. </TEXT>

Please keep doing what you're doing! </TEXT>
