	<TEXT>  those who used meninist hashtags "generally fall in two camps: people who use the term to call out ways they believe theyve been victimized by feminism, and people who make fun of the first group for not understanding what feminism means in the first place"

From Wikipedia. Huh. I guess you're right. I thought they were all the first group. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just Google "[tv show/ movie] reviews" and look at both sites. Then maybe skim one or two reviews if I'm curious.

And I agree that IMDb is good for individual episodes. Which is why I like using that sight that graphs each of the individual episode ratings. It's called Graph TV or something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always read on Reddit about how good Jon Stewart is. Then I saw [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=50MU4Cz62so) about how good Craig Ferguson is. Both of these shows seem like something I would've really liked. Is is worth going back and watching some of the episodes even though they're old. Those late night shows don't seem like they are meant to be watched other than when they air. 

And if they are worth watching, can anyone recommend a few episodes from each year or month or something to watch. I don't wanna watch all the thousands of episodes. Are there any "best of" lists for those shows? Like a list of the best segments or episodes? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how many "Star Wars Anthologies" they plan on making but I think those are a good opportunity to do something different. However the numbered movies seem to be the story of the Skywalkers so I assume those will all be Star Wars-y. 

After 9 I'd rather them not do any more numbered movies (though if 8 and 9 are as successful as 7 then doing 10,11, and 12 is the obvious next step) and expand on the universe with a bunch totally different movies like you described.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So it was a sci-fi podcast. There were three "seasons" last I checked. It got really complicated so I kinda gave up on it, but I wanna check it out again. 

I remember the first episode started with some mysterious guy going into a party with a briefcase and looking all mysterious. Then someone asked him why he was wearing sunglasses at night (it was night and he had sunglasses on). He took off his sunglasses and he had no eyes. Just eye-sockets. Then he went into the party and met with some mob boss and traded his briefcase for a little girl who was being held hostage. Then when he left the place exploded. He had snuck a bomb into the briefcase or something. 

It also had detectives investigating the whole thing. And one of the detectives liked doing things "not by the book" or something like that. 

It quickly got complicated and there was conspiracy involved I think.  It might've taken place on  a second Earth. It definitely took place in the year 4000-something. Each person had a very distinct voice so you could tell them apart.

And part of the reason it was so complicated was because (I didn't listen very closely, and also) a bunch of major items and people were only referenced by long code numbers. Like Q777639Z or something.  

That's what I can remember and some of it might be a little off.

Anyone know the name of this podcast.  Thanks in advance. </TEXT>
