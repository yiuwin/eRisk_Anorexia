	<TEXT> Some people take what their neighbors think about them way too seriously.

Case in point: The lady 3 houses away will no longer hang her laundry out on the clothesline because her next-door neighbor complained about having to look at her "personal items" and that it "detracted from their quality of life experience."

It really hurt her feelings. Now, she's paying to use her electric dryer instead of letting clothes dry outdoors naturally. </TEXT>
