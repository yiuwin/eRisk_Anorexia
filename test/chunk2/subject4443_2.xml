	<TEXT> I feel it's the other way around. If Fox News does start mentioning even half of the crap Republicans do, they'll loose viewers quickly.  

Right now most people watching it are Republican and Trump supporters who are more loyal to their leaders and support only those who promote their beliefs rather than actual facts. 

If Fox starts doing that they'll initially start complaining about its falling standards and later claim its a sellout or "fake news" . Since Trumps Twitter account is the only source of "real news" for them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. 

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

"You know what? No," said the executioner. "I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now." 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said "Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor." </TEXT>

Most of the 9/11 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia and UAE but Trump owns businesses there, also Turkey which is radicalizing fast.  </TEXT>

Automation is the future. A friend of mine is automating jobs at his workplace. The post he's currently automating is the one he started when he started working at the place. He told me that around this time by the next year, most jobs at his workplace will be automated. It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> gg mate. That's one hell of a beautiful rig. 

That said. Hope the rams are in quad channel. Also you could've used a bigger monitor (are there bigger ROG monitors?) this one looks small for your setup. Even though you've got your TV, Cuz monitors are monitors. With the Titan XP, GSYNC and variable refresh rate. 

Also mechanical rgb keyboard, rgb mouse, multi monitor setup. Some people may suggest SLI with another Titan XP, but looking at the feedback from r/nvidia SLI performance gains apparently aren't worth the cost.

All said. The rig says you spent your money wisely. Good gaming. Cheers. </TEXT>

Then Sean Spencer will release a(emotionally charged) statement saying that the bookshelf has the most books on it ever in history.

	<TEXT> This [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5q4vcg/_/dcwt4tw?context=1000) explains why this assumption is wrong.


 In contrast to the EU, the US does not send money to Palestinian Authority accounts. Instead the US has an aid agency aptly named USAID operating in Palestine which directly funnels money to humanitarian projects. The funds are extremely unlikely to be used for terrorism. </TEXT>
