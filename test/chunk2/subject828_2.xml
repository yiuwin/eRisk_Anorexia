	<TEXT> So you're saying essentially that the side step attacks from those two heroes are too slow since the Conq has his guard up by the time it connects, yes? Sounds more like an issue with those heroes rather than the Conq. The shield bash only does damage if the level 2 Feat is active, can't remember the name of it, and to get those single light whacks is a time consuming thing. He's supposed to be the best for Defense. I mean he even moves while in Full Block. I think one of the biggest problems is that he wasn't a part of the Campaign much and isn't a popular hero so not a lot of people know what to do versus him. Also, isn't that Unlock Guard Mode attack thing kind of bugged with non parriable or something? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I play Conq mostly and this isn't entirely right. You can be hit during a bash, and even guard broken during it's start up. He's pretty mean when the enemy doesn't know how to dodge the bashes, but he does very little damage per attack. Many times I've had someone on the last bar and unable to finish them off because of the low damage. As long as you dodge the bashes and block the light that follows you're fine. Even a heavy swing after a GB is too slow. Seriously just learn to play as one and you learn to play against. They're not OP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't even kill him. I did it a more entertaining way. If you toss him into the wall of ally Vikings, they all just gang bang him. Works for all 3 stages of bid boss fight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually use Conqueror. When I said spam I didn't meant like literal consecutive GB attempts, but rather no attack is ever made without first doing one. My lights are pretty fast, and can work on occasion. I'm just really opposed to things in games that offer free shots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's fine versus bots. I do it exactly like it's supposed to. But during actual fights it's a toss up because it requires prediction, not reaction. For me I need to press the button basically the same time their GB starts. It's incredibly frustrating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doesn't work when they still connect the GB while you're swinging. Happens to me on lights quite a bit. </TEXT>
