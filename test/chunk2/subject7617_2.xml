	<TEXT> Coming from NYC where uber is pretty expensive, we loved that between some resorts cost us, literally, $4. In NYC it'd be easily $10! Always came quickly. We used it between French Quarter and the camp grounds, French Quarter and Contemporary, French Quarter and Boardwalk Inn. All quick and cheap rides. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too would love to know what signals to give. I'm a "leave me alone" shopper in general. If i need help i certainly, 100% ask every time. But 9 times out of 10, wherever i am, i dont.  I either want what i want and want to leave, or just want to take a look and then if a question springs from that, cool! i'll ask! I am just not a super social person with strangers in general it gives me a lil anxiety so if there's something i could do or say that would really put the stop on it unlessi ask, that would be awesome! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all! - reposting here as requested. Cambridge Satchel is having a big sale so I snatched the classic batchel in red as i need a new bag for carrying my work laptop back and forth. Then after i bought it i read that the color can transfer, especially on lighter clothes. I have a beige wool trench coat I wear for the winter and now im so scared it's going to get ruined. Anyone have any experience with color transfer? Should i have gone with the classic brown? Any tips on how to stop color transfer if it should happen? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sudden Onset of Possibly Allergy Reaction to Alcohol? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-04 00:05:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 29/F here, from NYC. 5'2, 115lbs, half hispanic half white. In very good health, last had a yearly exam in september and everything came back wonderful.

I have always drank wine, beer, alcohol no problem. probably imbibe about 3 drinks a week, not a heavy drinker  by any means and never was. Was fine through the holidays, having beer and wine for christmas eve/christmas, then suddenly this past tuesday, 12/29, i had a very odd reaction to a glass of sauvignon blanc (a wine i always drink). My throat felt tight and swollen, my nose stuffed up almost immediately, and i felt light headed. I freaked out, stopped drinking the glass (got halfway through). Then NYE, i had a glass of champagne, same reaction. It happens about 5-10 minutes after my first few sips. Freaked out again, worried about a closing throat, though i could breathe, it just felt tight. 

Last night, i stayed away from wine, thinking it was a sudden allergy, tried a cocktail with vodka and amaretto in it. 3 sips in, i had the reaction. Passed on that.

I have an appointment with an allergist on the 12th. I feel fine in the in between, i did read this type of reaction is common in hodgkin's lymphoma (oh yeah, thanks internet for freaking me out) but my throat has felt fine, no swelling otherwise. I can say that from about 12/25 to 12/27 i was sick with a bad cold and swollen glands, pain swallowing, but that passed. I am unsure if this has anything to do with the reaction im having. Does alcohol allergy manifest in this way? could it be something worse? of course im super worried now until my allergy appointment on the 12th. ive otherwise been in fine health, no other symptoms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also use magical Moringa in the morning specifically because I like the matte finish and it does work well as a primer for makeup like some others said. It also doesn't make me shiny  so that's why I like to use it at the start of my day and then I'll use a more traditional moisturizer before I go to bed since I care less about the shininess. I'm actually not a fan of the smell as much but it grew on me after a while and the other benefits of it outweighed  fragrance </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all. I can't seem to find a cleanser that doesn't dry me out. I have a clarisonic brush i got recently as a gift and thought it was the brush itself, but im finding i used the cleanser alone and it still gives me tight, dry feeling skin after. I tried the Clinique one and that didn't help, I went to the deep pore one and that's just a little better. I've even tried a cleansing milk that unfortunately I cant think of the brand off the top of my head, but supposed to be gentle, and im still dry. I moisturize, and well, and feel fine after I do that, but its always right after using a soap I feel so dry and super tight and I hate it. Would love a suggestion on something that won't make me feel that way! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 28/f/NYC Looking For Email Penpal! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-05 01:45:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've done this once before about a year ago and unfortunately lost touch with some of my penpals. I am from NYC, born and raised, looking for someone to really chat with. Don't mind small talk at first to get to know each other but I'm looking for someone I can look to get advice from with work, relationships (I'm in a long term one, live with my boyfriend), life and to provide some advice back. And just to learn something new, wax poetic, bitch about the day with, whatever it may be!

I'm super passionate about gaming, not just playing video games but the whole industry. I love to travel and so far my most exciting trip was to Morocco; would love to hear from someone who has suggestions on places to go or awesome travel stories. I work in social media and always love to talk about that as well as tech and all that cool stuff.  I got into sewing over a year ago but fell off that wagon but am trying to get inspired to get back into it again. I think that Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the greatest t.v. show that ever existed, but Breaking Bad is a close second.

If there's anything you can relate to (or heck, have a counterpoint on!) please PM me! </TEXT>

He's definitely feeling guilty about it; especially because last year he brought me out to Michigan, a place he grew up going every year,a nd its totally out of my element. I admit, i didnt love it. But i did it for him. I brought up the similarities and he said he couldnt even defend himself. I mean, "it's too late now" in terms of like, he still acted as he did. But i made it very clear how it made me feel, and that i want more respect for the things i enjoy and love, and if that sort of behavior were to happen again it'd start to become a strain on us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the crowds were very unexpected, and i did my darnedest to plan things out well with crowd calendars etc but everyone in my party was surprised, and so were strangers we talked to, about how many people were there this past week. sometimes, you just hit a bump in the road. It probably didn't help (and is why we are planning to go back during january!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> he isnt, actually. he's such a silly guy, normally. SUPER silly. Not a day goes by he isnt singing, whistling, dancing around, cracking jokes. That's why i didnt understand the disney hate, i thought he'd be in his element of acting like a kid. nope. something about the combo of too many people/waiting in line/ and not getting the disney "advertising" that turned him right off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He actually overall told me he liked epcot the best. He liked food   wine a lot, and he thought world showcase was interesting, but he's also been to most of those countries already (save for china and japan) so it just doesnt "do it" for him because he's seen it in person, and i 100% get that. But thankfully we agreed on Epcot being the best park, and Mission: Space, the best ride (he freaking LOVED it, we did it twice and he was willing to do it a third time but we wanted to get a few more other things in). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it was the heat + crowds + lines. He told me he just hates amusement/theme parks as a whole, and though he appreciated the thrill rides, and the theming a lot, he just hated the people there (as in guests, not CMs), the long waits, and pretty much sweating 24/7. I thought it being disney he'd have a better time than say, six flags, but ive learned he just hates amusement parks as a general rule. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thank you! It is 100% not a deal breaker. we've been together almost 4 years...he's a wonderful boyfriend in every other sense, has a wonderful family i love, and has a great sense of adventure with international trips. He's more a "visit new countries" guy, less a "theme park" guy. We've gone to Morocco, Iceland and Spain together and had wonderful times. Clearly, those are the trips meant for us a couple and I'll stick with friends for disney. he understands im still going to go, it's not like he's trying to stop me. he just...doesn't want to be a part of it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Update on Trip with Cynical Boyfriend... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-28 15:50:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We're back as of last night and... he hated it. Absolutely hated it. The only things he liked were California Grill, parasailing, and Flying Fish/the boardwalk. He hated everything about the parks and would "jokingly" complain but sometimes it was kind of harsh. And when I told him to please try and be more composed about it, he would just get quiet and standoffish, even with friends around. He basically told me he never wants to go ever again.

it probably didn't help that for "off season" this past week was PACKED, and also felt like over 100 every day. I realize those are tough things to deal with. But he just didn't "get it", as he told me at dinner at california grill. Nothing clicked. Thought he was being hit over the head with messaging, felt like the place "forced him to have fun" etc. He was like "i understand you love it, i accept that you love it, i just don't get it."

So...my friends and I are planning January 2017. Without him. 

Yes, i am very, very sad he hated it. But i can't change anything about that. He'll be my international travel buddy (he loves going to different countries, he's been to a lot of them, so he didnt get the point of world showcase, for instance "just GO to those countries!") and he knows i will still come back to the parks every 2 years with friends, and we left it at that.

Oh well. So much for him feeling the magic :(

	<TEXT> well, today is the day. After about 6 months of planning, I'm heading to Disney World for my 10th trip and i'm EXCITED! Well, except for the fact that my boyfriend (who is 27, hasnt been since he was 9) has not come around. I gave him a few outs. I have been down there on my own, meeting friends, while we were dating. I had no problem doing it again. Did I want him to come because Disney World means so much to me and I want to share that with him? Yes. But not if he'll be unhappy.

We're meeting 2 friends down there, along with my brother (who is older, 34) and his girlfriend, so there will be a group of us. we're doing California grill tomorrow night, Flying Fish saturday night, parasailing saturday morning, food and wine on Friday (couple things as a group, california grill is a date night for us though)..all the pretty adult things you can do. His attitude is just making me dread this trip and I don't want us to have a crappy time because he's grumpy mcgrumperson.

So..wish me luck he comes around by the time we get down there! Or else this is going to be a long 5ish days. </TEXT>

But my brother was 7, and talked about it to no end. when i got to see it again in 2013, aside from watching it on youtube which we did once in a while, it was just...nice to see the show my brother loved so much.

we're going back together in 2 weeks (first time in 12 years we've been together) and i cant wait to check it out with him, just for the memory of it.

But sure, im not fighting to save it. there could be a new updated something. </TEXT>

I obsessed over this video as a child. 10 years later, we went again. 4 years later, again. Then i got invited by friends' families a couple of times.  I was hooked. In college, I was a CM at the World of Disney on 5th ave here in NYC (RIP, we closed it down 2009) and that was it. As if i wasnt in love enough with WDW, seeing the company from the inside just grew my love. And ever since I started working for my own paycheck, i just kept saving and going with friends as adults. Can't wait until I have kids in the future to pass the love on to :) </TEXT>

Usually I'm gassy up till the bm, then the bm is painful and very soft (or straight diarrhea on worst days). This is gassy even during, but the bm isn't painful and is soft but still has substance, and it's fairly quick, just urgent. In a way that's been harder for me to hold in because I feel the gas pushing it out. I'm just trying to figure out why it's suddenly happening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As of late I've had some very gassy BMs that have been tough to deal with, to say the least. I feel the urge pretty severely, i go to the bathroom and am literally passing gas as im passing very gassy (and i assume fatty?) floating stool. Thing is, recently i cant account for any particularly fatty or greasy foods ive eaten, at least not in a week+. However, before that I went on a trip to Disneyland and in fear of feeling ill from the food there, took immodium and then didnt have a BM for about 4 days. Could this literally be a "back up" from that? has anyone else had these very gassy BMs? I am going on a work camping trip wednesday to friday (well, not real camping, in cabins with bathrooms, thank god) and im nerovus about the 90 minute ride and everything. I just want this to pass! literally! </TEXT>

It was magical to walk through the Morocco pavilion and really realize how perfect it is to the actual country, it felt like i was transported back. On top of that, when I told the CMs from there that I had just been there, they were BEAMING!
