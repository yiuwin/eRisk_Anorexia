	<TEXT> Yup, gotta be careful too cuz they will get mad at you either way.  So many circumcised guys are happy that are they circ'd. I personally did not circumcise my son because I think it should be his choice and I just hope he doesn't hate me for it later if he decides he wants it done and I could have saved him the pain by having it done when he was an infant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm staying with my parents at the moment and this weekend my grandma came over for dinner.  She and my mom got in a discussion about my aunt (mom's brother's wife) and some diet she's been on and posting about on facebook.  I think it's Whole 30?  Anyway said aunt has always been a chronic yoyo dieter.  It was just kind of gross gossip for awhile and I was trying to not say anything and then my grandma said, "She'll never be small anyway, she's just a big person."  Apparently because my aunt is "tall" (she's 5'8 maybe??) her skeleton is bigger than normal and she can never get small.  My mom and I both tried to tell her that while there can be differences in bone length and even girth it was never going to be enough that their skeleton would MAKE them look large no matter how much weight they lost.  She didn't get it.  We changed the subject.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed.  I got really upset when my mom pestered me about shaving, and I refused to at first.  Then I went to middle school and got made fun of and realized she was probably trying to save me from that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine did.  My "graduation from the sixth grade" present was a razor.  I was upset because I really rejected the idea of puberty when it happened to me at 10.  Cried when I got my first period, cried when my mom bought me my first bra.  Eventually I started getting made fun of so much for my leg and armpit hair (including by my own mother) that I caved in and started shaving.  I choose to shave now, but I'll never forget how bad it felt when I shamed for it and didn't understand why was it something I had to do.  To be fair though I had some gender issues growing up lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely.  I was in inpatient for awhile with anorexia and there were patients there that had EDNOS and even binge eating disorder.  I didn't notice any hierarchy of eating disorders in my particular group either.  Mostly we just talked about our feelings and weren't even really allowed to mention numbers (weights or calories) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's difficult for me to judge because I WAS overweight when my eating disorder started.  I was not overweight for long because of it, maybe a couple months.  Unfortunately by the time people start believing that you have a problem, and for me if was when you could see every muscle and bone in my body, it's too late.  I know a lot of people probably do exaggerate about having an eating disorder but if anyone no matter what the size claims to have one I would never want to tell them that they didn't.  It would probably just encourage their disorder if they have one. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was really young (must have been like 6 or 7) my mom bought me some underwear and they ended up being way too big.  So they just sat in my drawer for awhile.  One night we were hanging out at family friend's house and one of my friends and her family was there as well.  I asked my mom if my friend could come home with us and sleep over and said something like, "I even have those HUGE UNDERWEAR she could wear!"  My friend had always been bigger than me.  I didn't really realize what I had said cuz I was young and wasn't thinking about it that way, but I still remember to this day how shocked everyone looked.  Pretty cringe, I still feel kind of bad about it. _ </TEXT>
