	<TEXT> I think you need to focus on what your goal is then.  Being a great player and being a great songwriter don't always go together.  For example, I hate my lyrics most of the time, so I found a singer to write lyrics while I write the music.  Likewise, keep a journal or a moleskine and write down phrases or things that stick out to you, the more you do it the more will pop out to you.  Also I think guitar tone helps the writing process a lot.  A loop pedal can be invaluable for practicing phrasing and delays or distortions can all inform your style.  DAWs are great but should be the afterthought IMO, guitar is a tactile instrument and the best ideas come with your feet on the ground and your hand on the fretboard. Good Luck! </TEXT>
