	<TEXT> Sigh.
Dude do you actually want people to just think up entire genres of comedy or something? I'm not sure of what you're after. 
"Old western ideas of comedy" contains basically all forms of comedy performed on stage or in the media, be it stand up, sketches, whatever. What do you mean by originality? Can you give me an example of a comic/group you consider original? 
The roast was a phenomenal success. It was the first of its kind done in India, a country quickly losing all its sense of humour especially when it comes to celebrities who we lift up to god status for some reason. In fact we need more of these. And no it didn't backfire. It's a shame that something not even on TV, that no one is being forced to watch at all has to be removed because of the backwards sense of humour of a country steeped in a Victorian mindset. 

I have no idea of what you want. Yeah, AIB is a manifestation of a sense of humour that is largely western in nature. It caters to that audience almost exclusively, the upper middle class/upper class people who like that. No one is being forced to watch it. In its niche, it's creative and funny as hell. In a country where the show most people like is Kapil Sharma/Comedy Circus and whatever, that's a huge achievement, and AIB is skyrocketing in popularity.  

If you're so against the implementation of shit that was done in the West first, you'll have to go after stand up, roasts, comic hunts as seen on TV, sketches, all parody movies/videos and every comedy movie. So good luck with that. All we'll have left to cater to you will be a bunch of Kumar Vishwas-es at kavi sammelans.

You, sir, strike me as nothing more than a desi hipster, going after what's popular with almost no reasoning at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is your laptop/PC very weak? Mine is and I get the same problem, except there shouldn't be a big difference between how a mix sounds through ASIO or the primary driver.
It is my understanding, however, that you should trust ASIO over your driver as it bypasses any modifications the OS does to the sound. So use ASIO and mix using it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aegon V. Travelling with Dunk he became really humble and connected a lot with the people. When he came into power he did a lot for the smallfolk and took away many of the unfair powers the lords and nobles had. The lords and nobles basically had a huge bone to pick with him and called him the peasant king. After Aegon's death at Summerhall, Tywin as Aerys's hand reversed a lot of the smallfolk pandering Aegon V had gotten up to.

	<TEXT> Highly doubt that they don't actually own the VSTs they use. There could be a lot of reasons that the instance we saw in screenshot was of a cracked version. 
BUT in my opinion, yes, popular producers really should be careful and not endorse pirated copies. 
If you can buy it, buy it.   </TEXT>
