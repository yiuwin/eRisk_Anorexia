	<TEXT> The way the media and US population propagates fear really troubles me.  I feel like we are just going down the same road that we did post 9/11 or after the more recent terror threats like the shoe bomber.  We demand that officials take action- often very strong action- only to later learn that we lost some of our personal freedoms with the example being the Patriot Act.  I agree with the article that quarentine policy needs to be clearly defined with protocols put in place sooner rather than later, but I worry that they will still be fear driven and compromise aspects of our civil liberties.  We shall see, and I'd love to be wrong, but I don't see rationality and scientific facts playing much of a role in law making. </TEXT>

As seen in the Duncan case, being uncooperative doesn't necessarily lead to mass death and hundreds of infections.

Being a doctor pays well, but going to a poor country and working your ass off doesn't. </TEXT>

So while yes, there could be travelers via the US, one could easily avoid the States on their journey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's be clear, they are only endangering the public by going out while symptomatic as defined by current scientific standards.

I would absolutely support those jail time and serious legal consequences for anyone who lies about their symptoms or goes out while knowingly symptomatic.  It is illegal to lie about your HIV status and knowingly give someone the disease.  That also pertains to Ebola. 

We trust medical professionals with many things such as our medical status.  We trust them not to kill us by prescribing inappropriate doses of medication.  I think we can trust them to monitor for Ebola symptoms and not go in public when sick. </TEXT>

In regards to statement a, nothing is ever unanimous.  If we only made decisions based on unanimity, nothing would ever happen ever.

There is no hard evidence, no because it is an unprecedented situation.  Models I have seen and responses I have read from potential volunteers suggests otherwise.

Self-isolate and monitor, yes.  Lock in house despite no evidence of disease no.  I know they do not just get up and go to work the next day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's never too late; the world will not end, but it will be much more difficult and expensive to contain than it is in Africa.  Africa is somewhat self isolated from the rest of the world for better or worse.  Many of these places -even the large cities- are more difficult to get to and from in comparison to the aforementioned locations.

We send teams into the slums/ affected cities and enforce quarantines on sick individuals.  We try to educate the people about the disease and its prevention and isolate the affected area from the rest of the world.  This is my ideal vision.  If it were to get in multiple cities/ slums (not just one or two), there would be another global financial crisis and probably to a greater extent than the small one which was seen with SARS.  Out of fear, governments and boarders will shut down, martial would probably be instituted and tens of thousands would die until the disease burnt itself out much like the 1918 flu.  Our way of life would be compromised for at least the time being and potentially forever.

I don't think it will get to be this drastic, but it's not out of the realm of possibility.  I also don't want the disease to become endemic in the human population of Africa because that turns this into a long term battle and requires more resources, but I doubt that would be enough to drastically alter society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that the sexual transmittance aspect worries me greatly.  The only saving grace of the Ebolaphobia is that I feel like if someone were to learn that their potential sexual partner had just recovered from Ebola, they would stay far far away- in both casual contact and sexual contact. (Though the casual avoidance is not justified, but I digress).

There have been some experts who have speculated that Ebola could become endemic in the human population in WA which is very worrying for the people there.  Ebola has been around in the animal population forever and has appeared in humans probably for ages even though it has only been recognized formally since the 70's or so.  It for sure will continue to ebb and flow for the remained of time given that the Earth's overpopulation status remains.  I agree, though, that if it ends up becoming endemic in humans it could be analogous to the discovery of cancer.  The key is to keep it from becoming endemic in humans, in my mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it makes volunteers feel like -whether justified or not- that they are being persecuted and treated with unwarranted suspicion upon return.  I'm not saying we should give them ticker tape parades or something, but they should be allowed to monitor their temperatures and pay attention to their own potential symptoms.

Dictating the quarantine procedures has been left up to the states.  In that respect, it could be a deterrence from going over because you don't know what the law will be upon your return.  Will the quarantine suddenly be for 42 days?  Why not 65?  The nurse in NJ went over before the measures were put in place, yet she was still subjected to the sudden, new change in law.  What is to prevent that from happening to other workers?  People like to know that they will be allowed to return home and to their daily lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many doctors and experts have argued that these quarentine procedurea are detrimental to what's really important- containing the situation in WA.  Sure, maybe there is a slight chance that barring implementation of stringent quarentine prodedures.  1 or 2 Americans could fall ill from spending time with these asymptotic doctors.  As you yourself said, this is a very remote possibility.   However, the chance that these measures deter people going to help in Africa and save lives is very high.  Is protecting 1 or 2 potential American infections/ deaths more important than saving the lives of many across the Atlantic?

	<TEXT> I agree with all of these things.  In addition to burial practices, general practice of how the sick are treated while they are actively ill.  For example, some villages are less at risk of being wiped out by an infectious disease because the culture and religious beliefs dictate that the ill are possessed and whatnot and must be quarantined to control the evil spirit.

Trust of the government and medical authorities is important too.  If you live in a country were the leaders have exploited you, you are less likely to follow their orders and trust that they are working for good.  Level of education comes into play here too, but even the most well educated individual will be wary of a government that has committed atrocities. </TEXT>
