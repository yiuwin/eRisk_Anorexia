	<TEXT> Exactly. The Spurs should be obvious. I mean:

Ginobili (with the ability to go off and drop 40)- 20ppg
Tony - 22 ppg
Kawhi - 26 ppg
Pau - 21 ppg
LMA - 23 ppg
David Lee - 20 ppg

Then you think about the defense and the roll players...I mean, obviously the Spurs are there unless I'm incredibly bias. </TEXT>

You seem to lack awareness all together. He exploited wealth. He showered himself in possessions. He did all the things I said he did. You tried to say he was charitable but really offered no evidence, and still that doesn't negate my initial point. Go back and read my posts. I don't even think you're reading them. John Lennon did not live a life that was actively attempting to do the things he preached in "Imagine." That was my initial point. You came in, like an asshole, trying to disagree with me, but you never had a point. Being charitable is not the same thing as having no possessions. THE GUY CLEARLY HAD POSSESSIONS (LOTS OF THEM), which was my initial comment. Dude, you're not even close to having a point that counters that. Your first comment was, "he has more right to sing that song than you have to write this comment." LMAO. You started with an insult. You're so oblivious that it hurts. Go put on your helmet and lay down. I think you've had enough internet for the night.

	<TEXT> Why would I argue that?

Because you're not that bright. 

You're argument was that he was charitable in 1970, but you can't divorce that from the fact that you related it to his greatness, which YOU DID! You can't divorce it from the fact that he had that money because he was FAMOUS. You also presented no information on how much money he had, how much he personally gave away. We know for a fact he had multiple homes and tons of possessions, those can be seen. Also, read this from George: 

"Between 1962 and 1970, The Beatles record sales were worth 17 million or in todays money 340 million ($500 million), yet the four members of the group were only worth in total 1 million (20  30 million now) in 1968. In raising their take to 2 pence a record, EMI had signed them on for 5 more years. The year after this contract was renegotiated (in 1967), 30% of EMIs profits came from The Beatles, and EMI in its turn completely dominated the record market, taking an unprecedented 40% share. Put another way, one in eight of all records sold in Britain in 1968 were Beatles records.

In 1965, George Harrisons response to the question of how much money The Beatles made went like this:

Im not really the most-interested-in-money Beatle, Im just the only one interested in whats happening to it. I like to know where its going. Actually, I cant quite understand why the others arent so bothered. We sit at accountants meetings and we are told we have got two and a half per cent of this and four and a half per cent of that, and that is confusing and boring and just like being back at school. Well, after a year or so of the Beatles making records and doing well, I started trying to find out what was happening and where it was going. John and Paul were equally interested, but they gave in. I didnt. Its easy to get blas and think were making plenty and somebodys taking care of it. But I like to know how much is coming in; where its being put; and how much I spend. We all have some private investments. Believe it or not, we still havent got a terrific amount of money in real capital. There are a lot of group investments in the name of Beatles Ltd. obviously because thats a very safe thing. There are lump sums in bank deposit accounts in the names of all four of us, I believe. There isnt a million pounds in cash or anything like that. Its mostly investments. Ringo has got his brick-building company and John and I have got a supermarket somewhere, but I dont know where it is exactly. I dont know about Paul. Im sure that he has got some good investments as well.

I wouldnt like to say I or Ringo was a millionaire in any way. But Id say that theres a fair chance that John and Paul are because of all the money theyve earned through Northern Songs. Id say that it would be very hard for all of us four to be real millionaires anyway. Lets say, for example, that a big pop star in Britain is earning 2,000 pounds a night. Then say, for example, the Beatles earn 4,000 pounds a night. That solo star has got that 2,000 pounds for himself. With us, it has got to be split four times for a performance. That makes, on paper, 1,000 pounds for each show. But we just dont do that many real shows. And for us to be real millionaires, every one of us, the Beatles would have to gross 4 million pounds! And dont forget that there is a tax fee to be paid plus Eppys (Brian Epsteins) percentage. Hey, it sounds like Im talking myself into being broke. Its not that bad. I know Im okay. If Ive got 500,000 pounds, Im not really bothered about the other half million.

My point remains: you're not worried about money as much when you have a ton of it, and John had so much he didn't have to worry about it. Who knows how much he wanted to give away money through Apple. It appears that George was far more interested in organizing the bands finances, even though John made more money. You've been struggling to put together some kind of argument, and I see why. You said the guy had rights I don't have because he gave away money through a business. Who said I wouldn't have given away that money if I had that opportunity? Is that really your argument? That's taking out the great part that's apparently not part of your argument. Lol. I'm done trying to educate you. You're beyond hope.

For the most part, it's contributed to our success as a species. I also don't expect people to freak out when we are winning. Spurs fans are conditioned to expect championships and a lot of us are not expecting that this year, hence the overreaction. I'd rather be an overreacting Spurs fan than a Knicks right now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Buddy, I already proved why the greatest comment wasn't nitpicking. Your argument was predicated on his greatness, or the fact that we was in a great band. You lost. Get over it.

Edit: Also, see Dunning-Kruger effect. It might help you out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He earned his right to sing that song more than you earned the right to write that comment.

How are you saying he earned that right? (is it by being in the greatest band, by giving away money through a business (which even Donald Trump has done), or both? You'll see where I'm going with this...or maybe not) It wasn't clear that you were insinuating that he deserved rights I don't have because a business he was involved with was charitable in 1970. The "greatest" comment is relevant because you used it as evidence for your point of view: 

He was broke in spite of being in the greatest band in history

I'll let you think about it. Have you caught up yet? Take any reference to the word greatest in that sentence away and see what you have. "He was broke despite being in a band." No, surely that's not your point. You're trying desperately to say that he was in the greatest band and was broke in the spirit of charity...that's how great he is! Do you see the relevance now? What's more, compared to a lot of people who commented on this story, myself included, he was hardly broke. Pretty sure he built his own studio in 1970...and that might have been the year he purchased the house at Tittenhurst Park.

Greatest is subjective; so is the word broke. He certainly could have made some money selling his possessions.

	<TEXT> This is a good point. I agree with you. I think people tend to take the man too seriously. He was pretty much a regular fallible human being who was an incredibly talented musician. My debate has nothing to do with what I think John really meant, more to do with the sentiment of "no possessions." I think ideally John believed in everything he said, he just didn't live his life like he believed it (which is the case with the majority of people).

The thing about the sin of being attached to possessions isn't about buying them, but being attached to them 
 
He then went into guessing how John felt about his possessions. My point was, "it's easy not to care about your possessions when you're loaded and can easily replace them." Correct me if I'm wrong. 

It was sarcasm, which I think was warranted by the lack of a good point and his attitude. See:

	<TEXT> I think you missed the point (and the sarcasm). Hypothetically, would he not care (who says he didn't care, maybe he cared a lot about it. In fact, I think it was a birthday gift for Yoko) about it because he he did not put stock into material possessions, or because the guy could easily buy the piano a few times over. I think I would value the piano more than him because I'm broke, not because he believed in no possessions (he had a lot of them and believed in acquiring them). It's quite simple: you value that which you have in short supply and care less about that which you have in abundance. If John Lennon really meant "buy as many possessions as you want, just don't become attached to them in anyway," is it hypocritical for him to be saying so when he has a wealth of possessions and can purchase them as he pleases when most cannot? Also, who is to say how much John really did value his possessions unless he committed some overt act like getting rid of them or taking an ax to them, which he did not. Overall, I think you missed my point.  </TEXT>

You can keep saying "you guys" think this, "you guys" think that, but the truth is you're just talking about opinions. You so happen to have a different opinion about John than what has been voiced be SOME people here. You also expressed enough reasons to find John Lennon distasteful. I don't think John Lennon became a good person because he started dropping acid lol. He's a complex person, yes, but so is everyone else and we still have opinions about those people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone has a minority opinion, or at least anyone worth your time. I'll take my downvotes like a man. The argument always comes up, "SNL is dead," "SNL hasn't been funny in years," and so on. I think they have funny comedians. With that being said, it's arguable that the writing is at a considerable low point. Think of all the great writers who have written for SNL, writers who played a live role in the show, who were famous while writing for SNL. Will these writers go on to be famous? Maybe? But currently, the writing staff is weaker than the cast. I don't see much to like in what they are putting out. It's been decades since the head writer(s) wasn't a part of the live show in some way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are just going for low hanging fruit...that would be too hard and too complex for the writers. It's easier to just make him the grim reaper. I think the whole Trump thing is played out. Let's face it, the guy is, and has been, walking satire. It's already funny (if you can divorce it from the tragic). This is why South park decided to leave well enough alone. Before I watch this episode, how many Trump skits did we get? If it's 3 or more I probably won't watch it. Alec's portrayal is probably less cartoonish than the real thing. It's not like what Dana Carvey did with Bush. Also, this is just my opinion, and I understand that people do enjoy it. It's obviously smart for business. I just don't find it imaginative and particularly well done (hopefully I don't get killed for this opinion).  </TEXT>

I also would be upset if he wound up on my team because I don't think he'd make the Spurs better. I also don't think he is even close to having a Spurs mentality. I can't be the only one who wants nothing to do with Melo and doesn't think he's a great teammate (or really makes a teams better).

	<TEXT> 5. The knicks are 5-10 in the playoffs over 7 seasons with Melo (some of those seasons he was in his prime). Melo has one of the worst playoff records of any play of his stature. To be honest, I don't recall him doing much to make a team better. Yes, he scores the basketball, but he's not a good passer. Look at this play for example: he's not even thinking team. He's got at least two shooters wide open for three after he draws a double team. I honestly don't think he makes teams better. I think Knicks fans are entitled to their opinion. It wasn't long ago that everyone recognized that the guy wasn't a great teammate and was really selfish with the basketball. Now, the circle jerk has made him into the greatest teammate of all time because Knicks fans are booing him. What's even stranger is seeing Cavs and Clipper fans think he's going to save their franchise. Would I be suprised if he did that? No. Would I be surprised if the teams actually got worst and ball movement suffered because of it? Even less surprised.  </TEXT>
