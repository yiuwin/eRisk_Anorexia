I hope you can get the help you need as soon as you can because thoughts of suicide are serious business. The pain and sadness you feel in exchange for not letting others know how much you're suffering isn't worth it and it will never be worth it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My suggestion, if you're looking for one, is to keep in mind that therapy should be approached as a course. 

What I mean by that is that you ahouldn't think that simply talking abour your problems will be enough. You'll have to talk to your shrink about ways of how you can train to function (or get better) even when stuff goes bad. 

In the end you're trying to learn how to feel good and function by yourself :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, I'm telling this in the hopes that this will help at least one person to avoid the situation I'm in now. 


I had major issues with depression, anxiety and a learning disability that made it hard for me to read or concentrate for longer than 10 min. Still have them to be correct. 

I wasn't able to keep up with the workload because my own problems were taking a lot of my time and energy. 

I was too ashamed of asking for help and telling others, friends or family, what was going on. 
I feared being seen as weak and incapable of taking care of myself. By not telling my friends I thought I wouldn't alienate them with my negativity but in the end it resulted in me shutting myself off from the rest of the world. 

Eventually the burden of the course-load was too much for me to handle and I crumbled under it. I am no longer a student. 

The point I'm trying to make here is that you shouldn't close yourself of from the world because the only thing you're doing is making it harder for yourself. Looking back on it I shouldn't have tried to do my studies and keep my mental stability at the same time. 

I should've fully committed to getting better because if you're not at your best your work isn't either. 

Don't feel sad for me, I have a year of free time until I enter another college (again an engineering field) and I'll spend it trying to learn how to function with my problems. 

Hope someone sees this as a wake-up call before it's too late. Stay strong, mates.

	<TEXT> I can try and give you advice that you can use. 
Obviously there's a lot on your plate right now but you don't have to take care of it all at once, you can work on those things in order of importance. 

There's no clear cut way on how to achieve that but there's a kind of thinking that may help: 

"You don't have to do something with your life, just do something with your day." 

Organize all your problems (write them down), identify the most important ones and take small steps towards the ones you can solve. 

At least putting them down on paper will give you some feeling of order.  </TEXT>

After 10 min my fps starts dropping to 10-20 and around 30-40 min I'm in single digits.

	<TEXT> The only role I can see this new techies being played as is a position 5 trilane combo who's job is to secure the jungle from enemy ganks, stack camps and join in for that suicide securing kill. 
 
The problem is that he may be excellent at his job for the first 10 min but what after that? Basically any hero that can go position 5 can support better than him later in the game. 

I don't see where else on the map he can go or what else is there left for him to do after 10 min (because if he secures the jungle he isn't getting much exp or farm). 

What are your thoughts on this?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there. I'm about to retake my second year of engineering and I'm not sure if want that. 

I have no interest in any of the subjects and don't feel any satisfaction when I actually start to understand things. My anxiety was never this pronounced (professionally diagnosed disorder) and last year I got severely depressed because I was falling behind fast.

I know I can finish this college but I'm not sure if it's worth it if I have no interest or drive. I find the idea of being an engineer very appealing but everything I've experienced for the past two years hasn't made me satisfied. 

Was anyone in a similar situation? Can you share some advice? Does it get better if I hold out? Should I be looking into other options? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My native language is Croatian and I know English and German better. 

My parents had satellite television so I watched Cartoon Network since I was 2 years old. When I was round 7 or 8 CN was no longer available. I continued my English education through lots of videogames. 

I still wanted to watch cartoons so I started searching for other channels. After that it was SpongeBob Schwammkopf on SuperRTL (Toggo), anime on RTL2 and a bit later sitcoms on Pro7. Now I have a DSD (Deutsches Sprach Diplom).

Point of the story: if you want to teach children languages put them infront of the tv without any supervision.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I might have some arguments if you'd like hearing them.


Consider only Nintendo's market in Europe. Anything a bit south, say Italy, Spain, Portugal, the whole Balkan and bit of the east (Hungary, Poland, till Russia) will never even get this imported because the user base is so small. 

Ordering this online will only cost more which would discourage people even more from buying. 

This of course is only a problem from the consumer side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, I'm really glad that you don't have to interact with them.

People aren't treating them bad because of the color of their skin. It's their culture that nobody here can deal with. Eastern Europe doesn't have ghettos, everyone is generally poor(ok this is a stretch but ghettos are few and very far between). 

Their culture doesn't promote education, their kids only go to school because the government forces them to. Till highschool that is. 

Imagine having a culture completely against education. A culture that thinks it's okay to take your infant kids barefoot into the streets to help you get more out of your begging. 

They aren't the keenest on keepin' personal hygiene either. 

People here avoid them at all costs because they don't see anything to be gained from interacting with them. 

EDIT: to be fair, as one user pointed above said, it's not clear if they don't change because everyone dislikes them or that everyone dislikes them because they don't change.

	<TEXT> Habits work in three steps: cue, routine, reward and repeat the cycle. 
You need a cue, something that starts it. Something that reminds your brain that it's habit time. Be it an alarm, a picture or anything that you choose.

The routine is most of the habit, it's the process of what you're doing. Brains like saving energy, that's why you have your autopilot functions. It's so you can get things done without thinking about them. Being mindful strengthens your ability to notice more of the present moment but disabling that autopilot would destroy your brain. It would basically overwork itself. 

Rewards are the most important part. The better the reward the more likely it is to repeat the habit. A reward is something you want, not something you like. What this means is that a reward is something you don't put of doing. You really like drawing but you keep putting it off? Drawing isn't a reward you (currently) need or really want. 



So now that you know how it works, how do you use it? You plan. Good habits are thought out so that they encourage positive behavior. There's something called keystone habits that create other positive habits but that's for another time. Planning the reward is important, it doesn't have to be a big reward but it has to be something you want. 

Now that you planned what will start the habit (or when you will start it, simple look at the clock also works) and have chosen an appropriate reward how to make sure you do it? You imagine yourself doing it. 
When you get in bed (preferably another time of day but I'm guessing that's when you're free) imagine yourself doing what you set out to do, every step, from your first person perspective. Like a video game. 
You go through that motion a couple of times from start to finish. Not thinking of what to do but thinking of yourself doing the things you set out to. You get the feeling like you did this routine before so think of it as practice. Brains like familiarity, this will give your brain the illusion as this is something you normally do.

This is a very simple version of it, hope it helps.

Ako itko moe pomoi bio bih jako zahvalan.

Znam da nisu ukrali jer bi trebali masivna kljeta da mi prereu lokot. Bicikl je star skoro 10 godina i zahran te ne vjerujem da bi ga itko htio osim mene. Pokuavam saznati koja firma je zasluna za postavljanje tih ograda da ih nazovem i pitam jel kod njih moj bicikl.  </TEXT>

I've never played The Long Dark or ever heard of it till now. Will have to check it out, thank you for informing me!

Completely agree with the cynicism part but hoping for it to end up good won't do much harm (I'm not a backer so it's easy to say that).

	<TEXT> Once I would have agreed with you completely. Would've thought that the setting was being wasted on a rouge-like (rouge-light?) but since I played Binding of Isaac I can appreciate the genre. 

It's quite fun and challenging and gives you great worth for your money. 

Have you ever played one of these? :) 

If not I would recommend trying out one at the steam sale if you feel like it and have a few coins to spare.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think they make the decision of making a "couple of (hundred) thousands dollars" commercial just because they feel like it. The decision must be based on market research because otherwise if the data wasn't there that something like this would assure profits they wouldn't even be thinking about making it. 

What I'm arguing is that the information on which the decision to produce this trailer is based on is misleading (for the publisher). There are much better and cheaper ways to do promotion than making an expensive short video that no one will remember a week from now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See this is what I do not understand, is it really worth making these CGI trailers? 

I understand that gaming companies have done a good chunk of market research to see how the general consumer is affected by the blockbuster mini-movie-trailers for games but in my mind there is no way that the money invested in this cinematic commercial (does even anyone that isn't into gaming know these are made?) couldn't have been better spent on game development or one-month-pre-release marketing. 

Every time I see one of these for I just see a giant pile of money thrown out the window. 

Can someone please explain to me how these trailers are better for the game than spending it on marketing one month before release?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A really great game that drops the ball by the last two bosses but non the less something I'd highly recommend. 

One thing that really bothered me was that when you chose the hard difficulty enemies gained a lot of health and damage which wasn't a problem in the campaign but it made the arena much less enjoyable for me. Also most spells are useless. 

Never played the DLC, what's the general consensus on them?

	<TEXT> They actually explained this in an interview with the voice actors. 

They record all dialogue alone in a room without other people so you got someone reading lines without knowing how to react to the other participant(s) in the conversation. 

They do like 10 takes of a sentence and then the sound team (I guess) puts in the one that fits best. 

It wasn't explained why they couldn't record with more people in the room so that actors could react to one another.

It has been like that since Asylum.  </TEXT>
