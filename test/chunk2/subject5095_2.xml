	<TEXT> For AP English Literature I curve quite a bit at the beginning of the year on practice multiple choice questions, but as we get closer to the exam in May, I start lowering the curve a little.  Still curve all the way to the exam (for reasons stated in other comments), but not as much as when we start.

For essays, though, I don't curve at all, though I do allow them to rewrite the essays for a higher score. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think what is also being left out of this is the fact that Shakespeare wasn't the only bard in town.  Just like today, once something became popular, others imitated it.  So just like zombies have been in vogue in recent years, Roman stories were in vogue at the time Shakespeare produced Julius Caesar and Antony   Cleopatra.  Just as most people now need little explanation of what a zombie is going into a movie because the basics are so widespread, the same would be the case with the basics of Roman history.  We gripe about how there is so little originality in our popular entertainment now -- well, they were griping about all the repetition (and flat out theft of each others' stories) back then, too. </TEXT>
