	<TEXT> I'm only suggesting taking chances with life that could improve your future and well-being. I know life isn't a video game and I don't wan't anyone gambling with odds that are out of their hands and risking everything they have.

My comment was more of a suggestion to not worry about branching out a little further than you usually would because at the end of the day the worse that someone can say is no. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is true, but to the player you know how many times you've lost before you win. They game acts like you've done it first time but you know. I know the two aren't like for like comparable but there are similarities. And I guess its the same with seeing someones success from the outside; you never usually see how many times they fail but only when they are successful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I currently have a pair of Fostex t40rp for work as I need closed headphones.

I've had a few pairs of decent headphones in the past but I dont really like to spend more than ~150. I really like Fostex but I wanted something that had a wider sound stage although I know thats a challenge to get with closed headphones at my price range.

After some research the AKG K550 seemed to be a winner; got them for 109 and I'm very pleased. The bass isn't as flat as I expected and they're just that bit cleaner, more responsive and most of all wider sounding than the Fostex.

I'm not the most technical so I can't get into too much detail about how they sound but for the price I think they're amazing headphones for looks, sound and build quality.

And also, on the plus side, they're very easy to drive so I can plug them straight into my PS4 controller and get enough volume! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-01-05 14:16:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I currently have Canon PowerShot SX280 with 20x optical zoom, I paid about 110 at the time and is now at about 80. It's done its job nice over the past 2/3 years but I would like something a bit nicer now.

Are there any similar compact digital cameras that have higher than 20x zoom that don't cost an arm and a leg?

I'm going on holiday in May and would love to have a bit more zoom </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would you recommend World of Final Fantasy if I've never played a FF game before? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've never truly played a Final Fantasy game before, only brief moments of a battle but nothing enough to know stories. I just recognise some characters.
I've just finished the demo of WOFF and I really enjoyed it. The demo was quite simple but after I understood the whole stacking system I realised that if done well the game could be very good.
I've read some short reviews on Metacritic but they're mostly from life long fans of the game so nostalgia and knowing characters must help a lot.
How would the game be for someone essentially new to the Final Fantasy series? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing for what it's trying to do but I do feel a little demotivated already. I know the game doesn't have any goals as such and maybe that's where the game falls short for me.

It's a shame because I love everything about the game like the activities and customisations but I find I lack the motivation to want to continue activities without actual in-game goals.

Maybe something like Fantasy Life would be more my cup of tea? </TEXT>

I feel like I can't abandon Animal Crossing as things happen daily and other games I can come back to... eventually.

Is anyone else in the same boat? </TEXT>
