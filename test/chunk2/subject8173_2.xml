	<TEXT> This is fucking idiotic man... I've been around girls who I have texted with and flirted with and that in no fucking way makes me even think in the least that I should ever put my hands on her. It seems people don't really grasp at all what it means to be a mature human being and understand when things are appropriate. You don't need a written document from someone to say okay... "Kiss me" or "touch me". But, I just never understood how people don't actually know when there are actual signs that say a move should be made. Slapping someone randomly on the ass, friend or not, shouldn't be done unless it was a long standing joke between two people who actually know there's a fucking joke between them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I forget who specifically Ranallo was talking about but he said someone was mauling their opponent like the bear did to Leo in The Revenant and you didn't even have to see the movie to know what he was talking about... It was in the trailer. Besides the calling of the moves that is kind of what put him over the top for me that this could be a really great thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, Ranallo actually used a modern reference on Smackdown I think last week where he brought up the Revenant. It's a little thing, but it helps to drop things that are actually fresh in people's minds whether from having seen the movie that weekend or even from watching the trailer. Unlike JBL who tries to pop either himself or Vince with ludicrous references to things from the 1950s. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, Triple H is old school in some ways and probably wants it like the old travelling NWA champions where they would show up for the big shows and let the challengers work themselves up to facing him. Then when a challenger is set we go into the promo phase and maybe a quick warm up match for the champ.

Sometimes keeping it real simple is the best method. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He is very clearly now Atlanta's every down back. Unless it's a blowout he should see 20-25 carries a game and is the third receiving option behind Julio and Hankerson. He sees between 5-8 targets a game.

So yeah... I'll be keeping him. </TEXT>
