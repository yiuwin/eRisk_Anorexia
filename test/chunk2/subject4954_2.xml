	<TITLE> Question about frame rate </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently started working on a stop-motion music video that I hope to post here in the future. One of the things I've noticed while working out various animations is that I don't have a great sense of speed or pace when I'm photographing all of the frames.

For example, if a rocket flies across the screen I'm taking about as many frames as a car driving across the screen (which should presumably be at a slower speed).

Here's the question - when I'm editing the video, do you think it's a viable option to deal with this by using a higher frame-rate for the rocket than the car? For example, my project is generally using 12 fps for each image. (The Premiere project is 24 fps and I show each image for two frames). 

If I use all the images for the rocket but only show them for one frame each, then the rocket would be 24fps, compared to 12fps for the car, making it pass at twice the speed. The render files don't look bad when I do this, but I'd appreciate input from this experienced community. Would this be something that would be awkward or noticeable to a viewer (in a bad way)? If so, then I'll just toss out every other frame of the rocket.

I'm just using a car and a rocket as a representative example here, so hopefully the question makes sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ditto. If there was a little man in a green tunic who threw a boomerang at those dudes, that would have sealed it for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As it turns out, the results aren't terribly interesting. They merely show wide ranging preferences, with a slight recency bias for La La Land. As is often the case with these polls, the more interesting debates are about the candidates left off the ballot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you added some big captions of a place, this would be a great modern-day digital version of the tourism propaganda posters that were popular in early 20th century design, which became a popular retro design fad in recent years. Especially places like the French or Swiss Alps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow - really enjoyed this. I wish I could get my dirty guitar tone to sound that great. Thanks for posting. They kind of have a Black Keys vibe. Wishing the best of luck to this group. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What to read next? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> New ElfQuest fan to the Holt. As a kid I collected about 27 of the original 32 Marvel comic books piecemeal while popping around comic shops. Ah, the good old days.

Regrettably, when I was in highschool I unloaded my entire comic collection to get money to buy a guitar. Of all the comics I sold, ElfQuest were the only ones I always missed. And I never got the last few comics to fill in all the gaps. So last year I splurged and purchased all of them, the individual comics, on Ebay. And re-reading them was pure joy.

But now I'm confused what to read next. It seems that the same content from those comics was at different times packaged into graphic novels, and it also seems like the creators have released many other ElfQuest stories about what happened to Cutter, Skywise and the rest later on (or perhaps going deeper into backstory).

So . . . after all of that windup - where should I go next on my journey?

Thanks in advance for your suggestions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you check that the MIDI echo is on? Sometimes that's the issue for me when I'm not getting MIDI sound.

Another troubleshooting tip - if you can see the sound coming in, but not hear it, try inputting it to an audio track and recording. See if you can hear the audio track on playback. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just thinking about this yesterday as I listened to U2's "All I Want is You," and realized the entire song is built around two alternating major chords (with a brief minor chord at the beginning of the chorus). It amazed me how simple the instrumentation was, because I've always loved that song and Bono's melody. I would never have thought that alternating between a G and C chord could be the bedrock of a great song, but I was wrong. </TEXT>
