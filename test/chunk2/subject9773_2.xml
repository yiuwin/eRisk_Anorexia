	<TEXT> That sounds like a whole lot of calories. I've been trying out a lot of stuff that was suggested last night, and I've done quite a bit better. I don't think I'm anywhere near 2400 calories though. It'll take a while to build up to that much food every day, but I think I could realistically get there in maybe 2 weeks or so. Thanks for the info! Now I have a goal to try to reach everyday which will help out a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would be the first person to opt for highly dangerous and experimental projects to inject Chlorophyll into my body so that I can just lay out in the sun and get my nutrition that way. 

I love cooking, but it more about being creating something and being artistic. I let the people that I feed clean everything up haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  for some reason just the feeling of half chewed food in my mouth disgusts me sometimes. Figuring out food and making time is a chore to me.

This. It'll get to the point where the food in my mouth is just absolutely revolting and for the life of me I can't swallow it. Either I start gagging from it, or I just have to spit that bite out and try again after a breather. And lots of times I just opt to sit and be hungry because actually finding food that seems palatable is SO fucking hard sometimes, and I know that I probably won't eat much and I will still be hungry regardless, so I just ignore it most of the time. 

I generally don't have a problem drinking stuff, it's only eating, so along with the smoothies and stuff I'm going to start looking at things like veggie juice. And I agree about the crunchy stuff..  weird! I really like things like Apple Cinnamon Rice Cakes when I really need to eat something. There isn't much nutritional value, but it is light, crunchy, and sweet enough that it is palatable for me to eat. Also, goldfish are a go to snack for when I'm really hungry and cant seem to find food. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have an appointment with my psychiatrist already set up for our regular meet next Wednesday, but tomorrow morning I'll make a call to my general doctor and let him know what's up and see if he can't help set me up with something. And my Father is incredibly supportive and convinced me to move back home while I'm dealing with this stuff. He is Bipolar 2 as well, so he understands whats up for the most part. Between Doctors/close friends/my Father/ and of course Reddit, I have a pretty decent support group keeping an eye out for me. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to drink a big glass of milk with a packet of Instant Breakfast and before that I had whey protein powder for extra bulk. Those are great and I noticed improvement with those, but now that I haven't been able to keep a job down I just don't have enough financial breathing room for fancy stuff like that. Once I get a job again, I'll add those back on my shopping list. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wat? There are legal meds to increase my appetite?! Wtf has my doctor been doing?! My General Doctor is generally really good at giving me all of the options available, I don't know why I haven't even heard of Orexigenics before. He is also an insurance wizard, so I'll open up a dialougue with him about a script for orexigenics and a good calorie supplement like Ensure. Damn, this is awesome! Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah.. I feel kinda dumb that I haven't said anything to my psychiatrist yet.. I have zero clue why it skipped my mind. I think he will be able to help a lot. 

The depression and lack of appetite is very consistent. I've always had issues eating from an early age, but it is significantly worse now than ever.. also more psychiatrist conversation topics. Thanks for the concern, I really appreciate it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, you're probably right that It wasn't only based off of my weight, there is certainly some brain stuff that I'm going to have to start sorting out. I was trying to say that I don't have the traditional body image issues of being terrified/convinced I'm overweight. 

Man, I haven't even thought about dips and stuff to maximize caloric intake per bite. That's a great idea and I'll definitely stop eating chips and veggies by themselves! I feel like I've been so inefficient now! haha 

and thanks for the tips about working out/avoiding cardio and stuff. I'll lurk on over to /r/fitness and see what's up in that corner of Reddit! </TEXT>
