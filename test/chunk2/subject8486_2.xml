	<TEXT> Lots of great advice here (and from others).

Do what you're comfortable with, but don't be scared of anti-depressants.   If you broke your leg, you'd take painkillers.  You wouldn't say "oh, it's natural and lots of people have pain and get through it." (Or at least I wouldn't.)

My wife took anti-depressants for her post-partum depression (in addition to therapy) and it helped a great deal.

The other thing I would say is: acknowledge her pain.  Don't just say everything is sunny, but say "I know it's tough not to go to work.  I hear you.  It's hard."   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True story: a MOT that I knew was walking her infant twins in a stroller in Harvard Yard, and the Dalai Lama is walking by.  He stops to look at them and then asks "which was born first?"

Which is a long way of saying that there are a bunch of standard, stupid questions that people ask when they see parents of multiples, and even the Dalai Lama isn't immune.  I suspect that your hygienist is not as wise as he is.  Just ignore her.  And expect to get asked it a lot more before your triplets are grown.

	<TEXT> Most tea snobs (myself included) generally go for brewing loose tea.  But by all means, start out with bags and the commercial sweetener of your choice to ease into it.

Bigelow is probably your best choice for decent teabags that are available in regular supermarkets.  Their Constant Comment is nice an orangey; they also have Earl Grey and Plantation Mint that I like.  Once you get past that, you're probably going to want to order online.

I'd advise against starting with Herbal tea or Green tea -- they're just not going to be flavorful enough for you, and not going to have enough caffeine to make you feel anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Somerville Winter Farmers' Market runs until May 26 on Saturdays (which makes it kind of a winter-spring market)
https://twitter.com/#!/somwintermarket

Unfortunately, given the New England climate, there typically isn't a whole lot of locally-grown food available until June.  This year might be different, but that doesn't mean the Farmers' Markets are adapting their schedule.

Edit: Probably more convenient to you, the SoWA Market on Harrison opens this Sunday: http://www.sowaopenmarket.com/ </TEXT>
