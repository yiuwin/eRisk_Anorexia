	<TEXT> My younger brother has seen them during night-terrors. Apparently it's a pretty common experience because I've met another person who consistently had night-terrors as a child and saw shadow people. She interpreted them as a good presence though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That would be amazing. I really hope he'll make a bit return. Trouble is news papers just don't really work for comics any more, and I don't think Bill has touched a computer in his life. So he'd probably need outside help to convince him to do it, and even then he might not want to :(

...Now I made myself sad :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indeed! I love weird fiction! And I have some suggestions for anybody looking for something new. Clark Ashton Smith was another great weird fiction writer. He was friends with Lovecraft and wrote some beautifully crafted short stories. In my opinion he is the best writer at "painting" a scene with his words. You can read almost all of his stories for free (legally) here http://www.eldritchdark.com/

Also if anyone is interested in comics, the Hellboy comics are some fantastic weird fiction / superhero / fantasy / sci-fi comics. </TEXT>
