	<TITLE> [Ubuntu 16.04.1] Lineart won't work running gcalcli in Conky for Google Calendar. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-12 06:18:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ran this in my conky config: 

    ${execpi gcalcli --conky calm}

Seems to give me broken lineart as shown here: http://imgur.com/27xiLgX

Did some searching and found this bash script advertised to fix the lineart issue:

    #!/bin/sh

    gcalcli --conky calw 4 |
        sed -e 's/(0\x71(B/-/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x78(B/|/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x6A(B/-/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x6B(B/|/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x6C(B/-/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x6D(B/|/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x6E(B/-/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x74(B/|/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x75(B/-/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x76(B/|/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x77(B/-/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x78(B/|/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x6A(B/-/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x6B(B/|/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x6C(B/-/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x6D(B/|/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x6E(B/-/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x74(B/|/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x75(B/-/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x76(B/|/g' \
            -e 's/(0\x77(B/-/g'
Saved as gcal.sh in my /etc/conky/ folder. I don't think that matters, but I could be wrong. 

Ran the following in place of my first command: 

    ${execpi /etc/conky/gcal.sh}

Which did nothing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, this solved it. Do you know why exactly? I knew I was probably missing something essential, but I didn't want to download all the bloatware of a normal Ubuntu.iso in order to fix it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you telling me there's a way to do this with a package manager? Because I would love to, except there isn't a way I've seen. 

I have Synaptic, but keep Aptitude installed in case of dependency issues.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can't install DuckieTV on Ubuntu Minimal </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-11 08:22:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Built a very basic Ubuntu Minimal system with Openbox. Downloaded DuckieTV (x64 archive) from: https://github.com/DuckieTV/Nightlies/releases

Extracted it to: 

    /home/me

Then: 

    cd /home/me/DuckieTV
    sudo ./setup 

Seemed to run everything fine. Now: 

    sudo DuckieTV

Gives me: 

    mkdir: cannot create directory /opt/DuckieTV/lib: File exists
    /usr/bin/DuckieTV: error while loading shared libraries: libnss3.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I did the following to try and fix it: 

    cd /home/me/DuckieTV
    sudo ./setup --uninstall
    sudo apt autoremove
    sudo apt autoclean 

Then ran the installation as I first specified. Same issue persists.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't understand how that could be causing my system to avoid booting to grub, though. 

It's LVM if that matters. Used the encryption method that was offered during the minimal install process.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My system won't always boot to the grub menu. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Minimal Ubuntu with Openbox and a startx script. 

It only boots to the grub menu to put in my encryption key half the time. The other half, I have to restart and press F12 at startup to boot specifically from my hard drive, despite my HDD being set as the first boot priority. 

Won't run at all if I run UEFI only, but running Legacy or Both it gives me this issue. Being able to boot into UEFI isn't a concern for me, just giving what information I can. 

If needed I can outline the install process I took on this old Lenovo ThinkPad x220, as I made it as minimal and simplistic as possible.  </TEXT>
