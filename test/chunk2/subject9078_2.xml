	<TEXT> Even an AI would fall victim to the unpredictability of humans. If you had a machine that could predict the behavior of society with 100% accuracy, you could theoretically prevent every mass murder, economic crash, and war. Such a machine would be very valuable to a government. But the problem is it's impossible to predict and plan for the future like this. Human social interactions are too chaotic. Your AI would make a lot of the same mistakes modern governments make, because of inaccurate predictions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By this definition Dictatorship is the best form of government since it has been the vast majority of governments in history

But dictatorships were eventually outcompeted by democracies. Democracy has been on the rise for the past 500 years, whereas totalitarianism has been retreating for most of that time. Also, even if there have been more dictatorships, I'd say the average democracy lasts longer.

I'd suggest that a "better" government might be measured by whether they fulfill the role of governance better.

Isn't this a circular definition? "Better" and "govern" are in both the term and the definition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By philosophy I meant the study of the world by anything other than science. There are certain things science can't give an answer to, like whether utopia is possible, or whether anything exists outside the universe. That's what I see as philosophy. But I'm no philosopher, so sorry if this is a bad definition.

Now that I think about it, I guess there isn't much of a difference between philosophy and religion. Other than the fact that religion usually has a story, with tropes like creation, warrior heroes, and a God or gods. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good points. But I still feel like people's religious and scientific convictions are a lot stronger than their philosophical convictions. For example, it's easy for political leaders to campaign on a religious platform, or on making sure creationism doesn't make it to school biology textbooks. On the other hand, you don't see politicians saying we should gut civil rights and make the Constitution completely utilitarian.

The same divide exists in institutions. There are universities and think tanks promoting philosophical thought, but their power is dwarfed by stuff like the Catholic Church and AAAS. Philosophy doesn't dominate public discussion like religion and science do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The most neutral way to define "better" is by way of natural selection, which is what I tried to do. A better government is one that outlives others around it.

So, to each nation their own, is my opinion on this matter.

A fine idea in theory, but in practice this just doesn't work. Countries and governments are always fighting to influence other countries and governments. Liberal democracy isn't just in places that have an Enlightenment tradition -- it's in places like Afghanistan, where an awful lot of people want an Islamic theocratic dictatorship. So I still think it's important to consider whether there is, morally, a better form of government. If there isn't, then I guess we'd be justified in overthrowing Afghanistan's democracy and letting the Taliban take over. But obviously, we're not doing that. </TEXT>
