	<TEXT> Can only speak for myself, but as a /r/silverbugs poster, I really dislike the self directed IRA part of this. Unfortunately a lot of the commenters here are uninformed and/or just spouting bullshit about precious metals in general, including the idea that we're all just stockpiling while waiting for doomsday (I'm stockpiling mid-market whiskey for that, btw). They're right though that self directed IRAs, at least for metals is a ridiculously stupid idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even a barter system needs some form of unit of exchange to grow beyond the hyper-local level. There's a reason that the old market towns where barter and informal credit went away. There's always a push to expand trade and that requires something to act as a currency eventually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know enough about the IRA aspect to refute you on that but in terms of holding physical metals, within reason (i.e. not putting all your wealth or all your income into buying and holding them), you sir or madam are misinformed, uninformed, and are just outright wrong.  

There are definitely unique risks to holding metals in person including theft and, to a lesser extent, fire (you are overestimating the risk of fire IMO), but most people have much more valuable items in their house to steal or destroy, so that is either an argument for total [detachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment_(philosophy\)), or just a bad argument. There are risks to any investment... including those at a brokerage and (ostensibly) insured in case of collapse. I say ostensibly, because, like FDIC coverage, a widespread collapse would cause an absolute crisis that would require a bailout of the insurance fund.   

I think you're sentiment is right, that investing too much into precious metals is a bad thing, but I vehemently disagree with your arguments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't buy into the doomsday bullshit, but the people poo-pooing precious metals usage potential in the case of a theoretical societal collapse, don't know their history. Before capitalism there was barter. At first it was person A trading commodity Y to person B for commodity Z, but that was often limited by distance, due to perishability of many commodities, and it essentially limited transactions to two people.     

Societies eventually moved on to basic currency, which took the form of seashells, rocks, and a number of other things. That allowed different villiages/groups to trade with each other as long as they both recognized the value of the token of exchange. It also allowed for longer term storage of value, what we would recognize as wealth. As trading expanded and society innovated and evolved, we ended up with coinage, that wasn't always but ended up often times being made of precious metal so that the currency was its own store of value, due to a common recognition of it being so (note, this is no more ridiculous than a dollar being worth a dollar because we agree it is).   


The above being said, while I think it's ridiculous if not downright stupid to stockpile gold, silver, bullets, or FCOJ, solely in the hope that it will become the defacto unit of exchange if society collapses and everyone falls back on a barter system, it's also ridiculous to say that holding gold is any more ridiculous than holding perishable commodities or anything else that is either a limited use item or a limited durability item (which would fit both canned food and bullets). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who cares if they sell it higher? That's irrelevant. For quick exchange you're going to take a haircut (it won't be 25% and if you're holding something readily available like Eagles, Maple Leafs, or Krugerrands, it won't even be 10% most likely), but for any non-cash store of value you're going to take a hit for quick exchange. If you want to sell art or bitcoins for cash, you'll take the same hit. For stocks, you don't even have that option though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Umm... hate to tell you but cash is going to burn at somewhere in the neighborhood of 500F, so almost any fire will incinerate your cash. In terms of insured investments, you're on more solid (no pun intended) ground, but it is no more liquid than metals because of the time required to sell. With both traditional investments and metals you're going to take a haircut, but you have more options to sell metals (pawn shops, coin dealers, online brokerages, etc...) than you do your holdings, which to sell quickly can only be be sold from your current broker. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stocks have a mandatory hold on the funds though after being sold, which in terms of quick turnaround for cash gives gold and other metals a huge advantage. That's not to say, to say the least, that people should be holding all or even a large chunk of their holdings in precious metals, but to say that it is better considering the fact that it isn't even close to immediately available, is utter bullshit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the event of an emergency big enough to disrupt the price and the ability to sell gold, silver, and other precious metals, what makes you think that you're going to be in any position to sell stocks or other investments and withdraw the money to your bank account, much less be able to withdraw it to cash.   
If you're carrying all your money in cash (not advisable) then you might be ok unless the value of that collapses... at which point you're screwed anyway, but otherwise metals are just as useful, if not moreso than cash investments held at a brokerage or in the bank. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the rate Ally offers (usually the best rate around) for a high interest savings account, he would have by my math gotten $932 in interest over those four months, which isn't bad for free money. If he wanted to take the safer bet, as unlikely as that would be considering what he actually did, then he'd probably get a lower rate from his bank.    
At his bank though he might have been able to get away with putting it in a CD though. That might have made it more likely for the bank to ask for interest back, but if not, then he could have locked it up for longer (say 6 months or a year) and still only pay the principle back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On a lark I decided to go back and watch [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4U5FqrOdQ), the 2007 iPhone announcement. It just struck me that the "three big revolutionary user interfaces," the mouse, the click wheel, and then finally multi-touch really were revolutionary.    

With the exception of force touch though, which IMO is underutilized, it's now been 10 years since the last major revolutionary idea from apple. The touch bar does what programmable keyboards from 15 years ago did, except with electronic icons replacing stickers and the well has seemingly run dry even on innovations for their existing products, much less new products.   

Lest this seem like just a rant against Apple's lack of progress, and because the rules require that posts try to foster discussion, I'll put it out there, to ask what would you want to see from Apple, what can we can expect from Apple in terms of future innovations, and WWSJD? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/randomretro's behavior on this trade is what every seller here needs to aspire to.  
He/she/they got back to me practically immediately after I PMed him, acknowledged my payment and receipt of my shipping info right after I sent it, and then had the package shipped out same day with a tracking number sent to me immediately.  
Not only would I trade with them again, I will be actively looking out for their posts again for future trades.   

 nbsp;  
Edit: Forgot to note that the shipment came very well packed as well, everything was safe, secure, and was in perfect shape when it arrived.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any tips for short approaches? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I usually don't post about pattern work at KPAO, since they're so non-standard that it just tends to confuse people, but since this question universally applies regardless of airport (assuming it's quiet when attempting, and has got agreeable controllers or is non-towered), I figured I'd ask it anyway if anyone had any tips for lining up for short approaches?    

I realize that getting the right altitude for the short final is always going to be more difficult with a short approach but despite being fine on the standard approaches and remembering my turns and speed, I ended up way off the center line on a few of my short approaches. Any general tips for working on short approaches would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Flight instructors without medicals? -- BasicMed </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-13 10:12:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know we're all sick and tired of all the BasicMed posts by now, but I just saw this on [this AOPA page/article about BasicMed](https://www.aopa.org/News-and-Media/All-News/2017/January/12/AOPA-details-BasicMed-rule?) and haven't seen any discussion about it yet.   

###Can I flight instruct under BasicMed?

Yes. The FAA has stated that flight instructors meeting the requirements of this rule may act as PIC while giving flight training without holding a medical certificate, regardless of whether the person receiving flight training holds a medical certificate. The FAA considers the flight instructor who is acting as PIC to be receiving compensation for his or her flight instruction under instructor privileges but is exercising private pilot privileges while acting as PIC of the flight.

	<TITLE> Tasting notes: Green Flash Soul Style IPA </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-05 15:47:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Just the facts:**   
Size: 12 fl. oz. glass bottle   
IBU: 75   
ABV: 6.5%   

**Notes:** On the label, underneath the name of the beer, are two words separated by an ampersand, "bright   tropical." That descriptor could not be more true. The first thing that hit me when drinking this beer was the immediate amount of grapefruit that hits you right off the bat.  

The difference between this and some other fruity beers though, is that the immediate hit of grapefruit, while still present throughout, is supplemented very quickly by the subtle, but quite distinct hoppiness and the less bold citrus flavors that are present.       
Despite being a medium to light beer and very fruity, it has a bold taste without being heavy and with an absolutely refreshing taste and a good mouth feel. With just the right amount of bitterness and a decent ABV, I will definitely be buying it again at some point and would recommend it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Eurodance, electro-pop, and dance-pop as the "public face" of EDM </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-02 16:51:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was writing another comment (now deleted) and it made me realize that most people who hear an EDM song on the radio, or now more likely on Pandora or Spotify are going to be hearing a song that falls into one of these three subgenres, or other similar ones.   
I'm thinking Aqua, Eiffel 65, Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga, Mel C, Cascadia, Basshunter (some of his songs) even Katy Perry, although some of those artists lean much more heavily towards the pop side.   

My take, for what it's worth is that it's always good to get more people interested in EDM, but at the same time europop/dancepop and all of its derivatives/relations have to be the most vocal heavy subgenres in all of electronica, which kinda misses the point IMO. I was wondering what other people think though. </TEXT>

As the FAA medical division would stress, this is by no means an exaustive list, but this is their guidelines that AMEs look at when deciding to grant, defer, or deny medicals.    
 nbsp;  
Note: Do not issue means, the AME should not issue or should defer a medical, the do not fly list is medications that a pilot should wait a certain amount of time after taking before flying to ensure the drug is out of their system.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just watched *In The Shadow of Two Gunmen: Part 1* for the millionth time, or so it feels like, and this line always bugs me. Even if the time period of the show pre-dates HIPAA (the show premiered in 1999 in real time, but is set more during the early Clinton years), the Hippocratic Oath would still make this a pointless statement since he couldn't talk if he wanted to.   
Also, the line seems solely aimed at clumsily foreshadowing *17 People*, *Bad Moon Rising*, and *Two Cathedrals*, despite the fact that the quiet reminder to Leo about reminding Abby to tell the doctor about the MS, as well as the scene telling him about it, did the job of it being a secret perfectly well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much what it says in the title. A team playing two Bjorns on defense breaks the balance of attack/defense and hybrid maps. The best example of this IMO being Hollywood, where two Bjorns can effectively lock down the point.   
An effective fix would be to allow players either an easier shot at killing his turrets by increasing the time they take to lock-on or lowering their health. Alternatively a cooldown on building a new turret that starts when his turret is killed to stop immediate re-placement around the corner would still low for him to be formidable but allow effective offenses to "push" through. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> First flight San Jose International today as a pilot (followup to Sunday's post) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-01 08:22:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Even though we decided to do a bit of a different flight for lunch, as a followup to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/4px02t/planning_to_surprise_my_father_with_a_trip_up_to/) I just wanted to give a little bit of a writeup about my trip today.  
We got to the airport (PAO) about 1pm, preflight and everything else was by the book. Out of Palo Alto we did a Left Dumbarton departure down along some of the most expensive real estate in the country.    

Our original plan was to go to to Watsonville (WVI), have lunch, and then fly back after stopping at Marina Airport (OAR) but unfortunately the marine layer is a huge problem in the summer and the entire Monterey Bay was pretty well and truly socked in. Watsonville was still clear, but the usual approach to the pattern was already blocked and planes were resorting to using the crosswind runway to leave, making it a no-go.  

Instead, we went over the hills and did a few takeoffs and landings at San Martin/South County (E16), mostly to satisfy my currency requirements, and then headed back towards Palo Alto. On a whim, and because Norcal's frequency seemed quiet, I asked about landing at San Jose, after pulling up the ATIS, remembering someone writing here at one point that ATC everywhere will probably be more accommodating if you sound like you know what you're doing. The landing was fine and I was able to taxi back and takeoff straight out for Palo Alto. It was disappointing to just have lunch back where we started from but it was a good flight overall.  

I also learned a few things on this flight. I screwed up a little bit on my turns to a heading to join the pattern at SJC because I forgot to reset my heading indicator and it precessed. From their tone of voice, I am 99% sure that tower knew exactly what happened and that they were used to it from small plane pilots. Tower also got annoyed when I exited onto the first taxi-way after landing, as I had been to do, since it was toward the parallel runway rather than towards the parallel taxiway and ramps away from the runways. I didn't even think of it at the time but in retrospect that seems like common sense to just taxi a little farther on the runway and save everyone the hassle. I also got to land at Palo Alto without the crutch of having a PAPI, which was a bit of an enlightening experience, in that I ended up way off my glide slope (above it) until I caught myself and corrected.  
 nbsp;  
Edit: Forgot to mention one interesting point was that at San Martin we had a CHP helicopter on frequency looking for a vehicle that they were pursuing. They eventually caught the guy and left the area but it's always interesting getting traffic calls from a helicopter going up and down 101 searching for this vehicle. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Planning to surprise my father with a trip up to Napa and need advice (Peninsula to North Bay transition) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-26 11:05:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi /r/flying crew. I'm planning on surprising my father with a trip up to Napa County (KAPC) either later this week or sometime next week and I was hoping on some advice to do so. My apologies in advance for the length of this post.  
 
This will be my first flight since getting my license just under a month ago and my first time with a passenger since getting my license, although I had two goes with the DPE as a passenger (not that that really counts) and once as a student with my instructor and my father doing the bay tour. It'll be my second time transitioning SFO's Bravo if I decide to go that route, although I know where the Bayshore Freeway is and I am well enough versed on the transition so the Bravo transition itself does not worry me that much.  
 nbsp;  
That brings me to my question. From my planning it looks like from the peninsula a pilot can either go East, near the Dumbarton Bridge and then North, avoiding or going over the Hayward Delta and going around the Eastern edge of the Oakland Charlie or North, to the West of the 101 (Bayshore Freeway) getting a Bravo transition.  

My initial plan was to plan for a bravo transition on the outbound, which would give me the option of going the other way if it was denied and then up overhead San Francisco; however I am somewhat unsure as to what the best course of action is after that to get over towards NAPA.  
I'd rather not leave myself at the mercy of Oakland tower allowing me to traverse through their approach path to cross the bay at the Bay Bridge and the alternative seems to be to go up to San Rafael and cross over towards Richmond or go all the way up to the North end of the bay and worry about gliders as well as the two other airports up that way (Gnoss Field and Sonoma Valley).  

On the way back my plan has us coming back down the East Bay which would avoid all this but I was hoping for the more impressive, and frankly scenically nicer, route on the way up... ATC permitting. Any advice from anyone who has some insights or has done this type of route before would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about movement areas when NOTAMed closed </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-01 08:05:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A bit of an odd question but I couldn't find an answer elsewhere so hopefully someone here has an answer.  

Today at KPAO the runway was shutdown because someone in a 152 decided it would be a nice day to see if they could balance their plane on its nose after ~~destroying~~ tactically removing the front landing gear near the 13 end of the runway. Out of curiosity, a bunch of us (people from the club and elsewhere on and near the field) went out and took a look. One of the CFIs gave me the, hopefully common sense, reminder not to go past the non movement area boundry (at KPAO the boundry is located to separate the parking rows from the parallel taxiway, Zulu).  
 nbsp;  
The runway was shutdown by NOTAM the entire time after the crash, but the NOTAM was amended at some point to shutdown taxiway Zulu as well, presumably to give a clear path for airport vehicles, the tow vehicle, and eventually the ~~plane~~ scrap metal under tow.   
Obviously the smart thing to do is to continue to stay behind the line, if only to stay out of everyone's way, but I was wondering if a movement area taxiway being closed by NOTAM changes anything in terms of the movement/non-movement designation of the area? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was going to title this dealing with uncertainty and doubt after making a go/no-go decision, but if you make a go decision then you deal with it by flying.  I was wondering how you all deal with the doubt of making the right decision after making a no-go decision though.  

Obviously sometimes it will be obvious, but for example, today the weather was bad in the morning. It was overcast at 2500ft at the field, which gave way to broken at 4500 but with increasing winds. The nearby fields (San Carlos and Moffett) were both reporting low ceilings and windy conditions so I decided to scrap the flight after talking to one of the instructors at the club.  

When I got home (about 20 minutes drive from the field) it was sunny and nice (albeit a little breezy) and it looked like there were very large holes in the clouds, which of course makes me doubt my decision.  

The reason I can't shake this off is that this isn't the first time something like this has happened, I make the very conservative decision, but then end up not just regretting not flying, but feeling stupid because it makes me look bad if I cancel a solo and claim it's because of weather that wasn't really as bad as it looks, doubly so with a checkride coming up.  I didn't mean to go on a whine/rant, but any advice would be appreciated it. </TEXT>

I had the chance to hear KPAO tower close the other night, and I went through Live ATC's archives to listen to a few other opening and closings and they all seem to be slightly different.  

The only thing that seems to be the same is noting the time and the changeover in airspace designation. Other than that, some airports list out traffic currently on their scope, others give the opening time and the CTAF, most but not all give the latest weather (especially airports that don't have an automated reporting system running 24/7 after tower close). Which is why I ask. Thanks in advance for any insight you all can give on this.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apologies if this is better suited for /r/atc but I was wondering if anyone knows if you can request a practice PAR approach as a VFR pilot.   

This is of course assuming you can find an airport with such an approach and that isn't busy, but it seems like something that would be good to practice at least once just case a VFR into IMC situation made a real one necessary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What it says on the title. I often use the  amp;amp;amp; nbsp; (extra space added to purposefully break) tag to create extra lines, for lack of a better Reddit supported option, and doing so in Alien Blue works fine.    

When trying to edit a post or comment though, it breaks the tag, unless I manually fix in the edit window on each edit, turning the tag into   amp; amp;amp;nbsp;   (Again, extra space added after ampersand to purposefully break).   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Light sport aircraft went off runway and shutdown KPAO this afternoon </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately I have been unable to find a news story about it and the two liveatc streams only really capture the whole tower side and a very small portion of the airport ops' transmissions; however I thought it would still be interesting to the community.

My personal story in this is that I was at the T bars, just about done with my run up and with one plane ahead of me already ready when it happened.  I was about to switch to tower to call ready for takeoff when I noticed something at the far end of the runway and when I opened my listen to tower I heard them talking to Airport 1 and Airport 2 (airport ops).  
Somewhere on the tower frequency conversation about waiting for the NTSB and the higher ups wanting to hold the plane in place, which is when they started announcing (on ground) that it would be a 30 minute to 1 hour shutdown while waiting for NTSB. Luckily it was quiet so the guy to the right of me (KPAO has 3 parallel t-bars for runups, he was on the middle, I was on the left) was able to do a turn and then I was able to follow. I don't know how long the actual shutdown time was.    
 nbsp;  
Edit: Approximately 7 minutes in on the second recording is when the NTSB is mentioned and a 30 minute estimate is given </TEXT>

	<TITLE> First Bay Tour </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-27 12:10:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Wanted to give a little write-up about this while it was still fresh in my head from this afternoon. Apologies if it comes out a little stream of consciousness style, I'll try to make it at least somewhat comprehensible.    
 nbsp;  
We took off from PAO requesting a left Dumbarton for the Bay Tour, which for those of you not in the know, is essentially going up past SFO (which is in Milbrae / San Bruno) and up into San Francisco proper to sight-see around.   

PAO Tower informed us that SFO was not accepting bravo transitions, probably due to the fact that the winds, and thus more than likely approaches into SFO, were from the South. Luckily my instructor was able to sweet talk Norcal into letting us do a transition anyway, all the way up the center of the peninsula and into the city proper.  

We did several laps around and before leaving were able to descend to about 1500 feet. We departed the area down the West side of the peninsula at 1300 to avoid the bravo since Norcal declined a bravo clearance for us on initial request. 

We were heading down to WVI for lunch so it wasn't a problem, but when it was clear to Norcal that we weren't going to be a problem, they promptly gave us a clearance into the bravo which let us go back onshore into the 1500 shelf North of HAF. That allowed us a bit more leeway and a safety margin before we got to the 4000 shelf, which is nice to have in a less populated shoreline area.    

From HAF down it was uneventful, just following the shoreline down to Santa Cruz, and then the standard path following highway 1 past the drop zones and (almost) directly to the field.  

By the time we flew back it was night time but nothing that we hadn't done before. I misread my angle to the runway when angling for the straight in final, after passing Moffett, and had to correct, but otherwise it went well.  

Two takeaways I had from this. I'm really glad I had my instructor with me, if only to take the mic when talking to Norcal, and briefly SFO tower, for the transition to the bay tour area, since part of getting what you want really is convincing them that you know what you're doing and aren't going to be a problem in their airspace. Secondly, a newfound appreciation for the Norcal controllers in the sector(s) overlying SFO, San Francisco, and the rest of the upper peninsula. I have been told that SFO has the second busiest airspace in California, second only to the LAX bravo, and they handle it really well. </TEXT>
