	<TEXT> If it didn't clic on you at first, explaining it won't really work, humour is just that weird. Some people wouldn't get why a coconut hitting someone in the crotch is funny. To others, violence is inherently funny

It's because with the increasing gender variety, we might reach a point when the default ones are considered rare. Then, there's the "Only 90s kids will remember", that's another joke. 

Well you just fuse them and you get this, most people should relate to it and laugh. It's just a reaction caused by our deeply ingrained ideas. </TEXT>

It takes concepts we are all familiar with [talkative woman] and [bad driver woman] and links it with something which makes sense, [beer], because drinking beer indeed gives you those women stereotypes. Which are more often than not true.

	<TEXT> Darylprat I just want to tell you, you're right. 

This may be the only positive comment you've seen in a while, but keep working on it man.

Have you tried passing as someone else? Try creating an account and using it for a few months so it looks like a real person. 

Have a different personality there, I don't know, be rude if you usually aren't, talk about different things, etc.

Girls are stuck up and really stubborn, she won't change her mind, I've been dealing with one girl for years and she'd kill anyone she suspects is myself, but she's friend with a fake account of mine without knowing lol

Girls don't learn, but we can do it. And it's especially bad because everyone will side with her, even strangers will try to get the authorities involved to keep you away from her.

People are very rude but that's the world we live in. I'd recommend you reading TheRedPill and basing your new personality on their teachings, be cool (not nerdy or romantic) on your new account and you'll have some nice talks with her.

Also, learn to use proxies to change your IP, if she involved the cops, she can probably identify any fake account by cheking its IP.

I've fought alone for years so I know how a positive comment can help you. Please tell me if you read this </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's totally on your heads, looneys, imagine someone who doesn't know jack about the world. 

How would he know he's trans? For all he knows, women also have dicks. So... is it because he sees girls playing with dolls and he feels like he should be also playing? Is it totally social? "Oh girls do that so I must be one too"

All crap. Humans can't be born in the wrong sex, humans don't even naturally know about the other (and only one) gender. 

Gender dysphoria is a mental illness but scientists are too afraid to keep looking for a REAL solution. They just mutilate genitals and call it a day </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course it has to do a lot with the GG incident, before then at least I didn't even KNOW about SJW. 

I only bullied "special snowflakes" from tumblr but didn't know there was a whole movement about them. 

I don't even like how is "casually offensive" a bad thing now. I mean, at least where I live, it's just the norm to shit on everyone AND NO ONE BATS AN EYE. 

That's how Reddit must be. Let everyone drop the N and F-words like atomic bombs on japan. Don't try to censor how we'd normally talk, it's just alien

And yes I'm conservative, I just think (like MANY others) that things should stay the same. No more weirdness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sea King under rain would be a hard match. People give him too little credit.

That SK was giving SONIC a hard time running and pretty much did catch him. That's an IMPRESSIVE feat which shouln't be overlooked. 

I'd say they're pretty even in firepower but SK is HARD, I mean, a punch from Puri Puri couldn't hurt him pre-rain. And he even has fast regen.

I dunno. Maybe Metal Bat takes it with a full force hit to the head, but it will be the hardest fight in his life, he aint coming out in one piece. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know about it but "Everybody", "Baby one more time", "Toxic" and "Oops I did it again" already became pop classics.

Even if it's the same guy, clearly it's not all the same shit, I can hardly find songs that compare to those (even within their own albums). Pop gets bad word but those are examples of how you do it right.

Now, One Direction and other modern pop bands, those are selling on image alone, nowadays they don't even try to be catchy. </TEXT>

Shooting for the stars

You've got to raise the bar

Grinding out my best

Blow them all away"

Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!"

	<TEXT> "Most popular opinion" I wish that was true.

Problem is, only half of reddit is fine using any curse word you can possibly imagine. 

The remaining redditors are so fucking vocal about wanting a safe bubble where no one says bad words which make them cry.. so annoying. 

Looks like they never went to school or something, there you didn't only get verbally offended, we also punched each other so words don't really matter to us. </TEXT>
