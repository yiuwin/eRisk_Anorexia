	<TEXT> Sorry for late response, I have been travelling a lot recently and have not really had acces to internet. You will be pleased to know that a lot had been done,  the server is working and users can register and login, also the tutorial room for the game is almost finished and the only thing needed for a fully functioning mmorpg is being able to see other players in your screen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> nice! I'm a bit worried about all these things being totally public. Is there a way in Piskel in which you can only share assets for this game with me? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot, are all of your resources for this game?
Also, can you stick to making dungeon tilesets, because I really need consistency with everything. Thanks again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you have a real talent for this. It's really good, very well done! Thinking about it now though 16x16 would look better on the map(try to keep some main colours, with more simplistic lighting in the 16x16), though this would make a great boss, so I will keep this for later additions. Thanks again for your support and effort!

We could call this boss "The Forgotten Knight", as it won't be used for a player sprite.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And also you can make bosses, go as creative as you want, there isn't really a limit.

For the final boss, I think I will hold a competition, and there will be a vote on which one is used. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great! I need all the help I can get. Go crazy with the items, I want there to be as many items as possible(to an extent). I'd suggest making T1 to T16(1 item for each tier)if you want, then going onto making UT items, then literally go crazy, make as many as you want and make then fabulous(but keep them within a 16x16 box for each). There will be Knight, Rogue, Wizard, so you will need to make items for each class, and there are weapons, armor, abilities, and rings. This is a lot to ask so don't feel like you have to do all of it at all, but if you want you can join in, and then send them to me(we will figure that out later).

As far as coding, yes it will be easy to make the actual game, but right now I'm doing a lot of server side stuff, which is not exactly simple, so I may be a while before I can start adding the bosses, enemies, items etc.

Thanks very much! I wish you good luck!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> maybe, that as well. After all these suggestions, the loot system is going to be fairly complex, though hopefully it will work well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your a legend, I was looking for someone to do a couple sprites, as my friend is slacking off. If your familiar with sprite sheets, maybe it is too much to ask, and if you don't feel like you want to do it then that's fine. Here's what I need: Knight(2 frames each for down, up, left, right movement) with a transparent background, and each one must be 32x32(fairly detailed), you can start with that if you want, then we will see, because there are a lot, I mean a lot more sprites that will have to be done at some point. Thanks very much! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, there will be a final boss, s/he won't be called Oryx, someone suggested making Oryx an easter egg, which I will definitely do. So maybe you can start thinking of a name for the final boss. Thanks! </TEXT>
