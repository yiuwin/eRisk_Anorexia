	<TEXT>  But it is to the people who post on this sub that I was specifically referring to when I talk about complaining. Nearly every trainer I interact with when I am actually out and about seems very cool about the whole thing.

Yes, I find this to be the case with everyone I know as well. We all complain and joke for a few minutes and then we're still excited to play the game at the end of the day.

 Niantic will tweak it in time as they have other areas of the game.

Definitely. I do think they mess up sometimes, but I have faith that they will get it right eventually.

 my wife and I play together occasionally.

Ah... I'm jealous. My girlfriend lets me do my thing sometimes and she'll occasionally catch a Pokmon for me if I'm driving or something, but she doesn't really care for the game and thinks it's a waste of her time.

 I spent 30 minutes at the beach looking for a Lapras that never materialized.

I totally agree. I have ... maybe 15 or 20 Pokmon left to catch (of what's available to me) and 3 of those appeared in my Sightings list at my house in one week recently. (Kabuto, Hitmonchan and Flareon, which I now have thanks to working in an Eevee biome since this month.) With Niantic's terrible tracker and them constantly changing spawn points and spawn times, I spent almost half an hour each of those 3 times looking for the Pokmon in my complex and could not find it. I still have no idea where that spawn point is because it still occasionally spawns rare-ish Pokmon like Charmander or Charmeleon, Onix, Nidoking, etc and I can never get them. At one point, I knew all the spawn points and times in my immediate area, but now I've just come to accept that it must be in a neighbouring complex somehow, even though the Pokmon remains in my sightings pretty much all the way around my rather large complex. Because the sorting changes randomly, I never know whether I'm close or not.

 I'm optimistic as a whole, I'm just getting very tired of the endless repetitive complaints I see here.

Same. I hate certain situations or issues, but overall, I play the game because I love it and I can't agree with the "mass" of people that rage-quit every time one line of code goes wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  people bitching for the sake of bitching

I agree and disagree with this. Yes, you're totally right. No matter WHAT Niantic does, there will always be people that are for and against their actions. However, regardless of how you and I as individuals feel, it's unfortunately the majority that matters... as it should be. If 89% of people want gyms removed, over time, it will probably happen. It would suck, but that's how it usually works.

For certain situations, I do think people over-complained for nothing or for a minimal change (like the prestige changes. Niantic is playing with this to get to a norm. People don't understand that and are over-reacting. However, at the same time, those are the people that are giving feedback ... to an extent... and that's what Niantic needs.)

 How many comments did we see where the nearby list made the game "literally unplayable"?

Yes, you're right. If you're talking about the old tracker(s), people overreacted for a few things, and again, Niantic is still playing with the concept till they get a better tracker.

I've always overlooked changes where I could and I've gotten used to whatever I needed to.

However, this tracker is seriously a big change. I don't think you can understand it if you are serious about the game and don't live in a city.

If you have a Dragonite 100m away from you and there's a Pokstop 2km away with a nearby Pidgey, it will only show the Pidgey.

If you don't see this as a problem, maybe you're not as crazy about collecting/catching or maybe you've already completed the Pokdex and you're just cruising now. But this is a big deal for most players and this actually does negatively affect the game a great deal. I'll never use the phrase "literally unplayable" for no reason, because it still technically is possible for us to still find that Dragonite if we walk around, but the fact that we're not able to use the tracker to do that is a problem.

You mentioned earlier that as soon as you moved away from the Pokstop, the Sightings showed normally, but that also means you may be moving away from the rare Pokmon that you want to catch. The problem is that you cannot know this.

Niantic will surely change the tracker many more times, but this one definitely does not work well with their game.

 They could seriously put in a pokemaps style overworld tracker with flashing fucking arrows and people would still complain that they have to walk all the way across the street still or some other such bullshit.

That's true. But don't assume the people complaining about everything are the majority or anyone important. That's probably 5% of the people on this sub. </TEXT>

When I put a Pokmon in a nearby gym, it's usually kicked out within the hour (unless I go there in the middle of the night, which I'm not entirely comfortable with). So it's almost impossible for me to get more than one gym on my side before claiming. It's easier to just do one, claim immediately and do the same thing next time. </TEXT>

Not that it affects me. I haven't spent a cent on the game, but it just seems like they'd make a lot more money.

Great balls could be double the Pokball cost. Ultra balls could be 4x the Pokball cost.

Also, Potions, Super Potions, Hyper Potions, Max Potions, Revives. Even Razz Berries.

Literally every collectable item should be available for sale in the shop. I don't get it. It's just extra money for them. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Would this promote gym battles?

You guys can discuss details of how this would work, but I would like to think that you'd still get stardust etc from keeping your Pokmon at the gym and maybe something additional like a "time in gym" counter that would eventually give more bonuses.

The coins are not rewarded if the gym is already at max prestige. The coins are not rewarded if you lose the battle.

EDIT: **This is why I suggested this...**

I pass by low level gyms owned by my own team because it takes too long to prestige one to add a Pokmon.

But if there's a level 3 gym of an opposing team, I may fight it because it usually takes around 3 battles to take it down.

Then I can add a Pokmon, immediately claim my 10 coins and expect it to be taken down in 5 minutes.

I know Niantic is experimenting with this, but at the end of the day, it's still harder to train a gym.

So, either you snipe your own team's gym or you spend half an hour training it one level, only for it to be sniped from you.

OR, you could battle it 10 times to gain that level and in doing so, you've already gotten the 10 coins, yet you've opened up the slot to add a new Pokmon to it.

And it sucks a bit to rely on your Pokmon to defend a gym with the constant turnover of gyms now.

I'd definitely more likely to battle once for one coin than to battle 10 times for a probable 10 coins (if I'm not sniped).

In the same way, I could go to a level 10 opposing gym and fight it once to get my one coin and take it down a notch. Then each person might do the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly: I don't know who's worse with this obsession... you guys for writing all that, or me for reading it and commenting.

Secondly: This is great stuff. I'm glad that you included most of your thoughts and not just one idea.

So, I initially thought that the only way would be to introduce the new Pokmon into the current environment and that the separated regions made no sense... but after reading your thoughts on how it could work, I'm warming up to the idea of having two separate regions.

However, I think that it sort of ruins the link between the worlds to separate it.

You guys used Zubat--Golbat--Crobat as an example in your post, but if you had to separate 001-151 from 152-251, you'd essentially not be able to catch Kanto Pokmon in Johto. Meaning you'd only be able to catch Zubat and Golbat in Kanto and then go back to Johto to evolve it, am I correct? I think this might make sense for this specific example, but what about something like Chansey--Blissey? I've played Pokmon Go since day one and I still haven't seen or caught a Chansey. If I have to continue playing in Kanto JUST to catch/hatch a Chansey, I'd lose my mind. (Chansey is nowhere near the only one I have left in my Kanto 'dex, but just as an example... that would be a pretty crappy situation in my opinion.)

I know it would be complicated, but I believe there should be a combination of sorts. Generation II should be unlockable, but perhaps using the full 251 from the National Pokdex with the relevant rarity in the game. I know it would be an issue where that Chansey I mentioned suddenly becomes twice as rare and I agree that that would be a problem... However, it could be possible that events would be added often where certain Pokmon could be found more easily. If it wasn't a daily or weekly thing, I could easily see Chansey being a Mother's Day thing and maybe Kangaskhan also made available worldwide for that day. There's so much potential for events and additions in this game that it could still work out very well for Niantic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, both you and u/FatherMcNugget are being a bit too aggressive with your opinions, yet you both are pointing out what I personally want in the game.

-----

I want to catch as many Pokmon as possible. I do actually want to finish my Gen 1 'dex before Gen 2 comes out, but if I can't, I'll deal with it. I can't wait to find a whole lot more out there and get excited all over again. I can't wait to see Feraligatr and Typhlosion in gyms. And to get a Tyranitar. It's going to be awesome.

-----

On the other hand, I completely agree that catching all these Pokmon should at LEAST give you the ability to play with them, take photos with them, etc. I totally understand the casual nature of this game and why they had to deviate from the main games, but the entire Pokmon franchise has based their thoughts around "Be good to your Pokmon and treat them as your friends."

How are we capturing that in any way? We catch as many as we can, evolve one good one and throw the rest away. Then the only interaction we have with that good one is to power it up when we can and use it to fight in gyms. Then, one day, we find a better one and replace that good one too.

There's supposed to be incentive to keep the one you befriended and spent time with. There's supposed to be much more that you can do with your favourite Pokmon. The only thing I can do with my favourites now is click on them and see them doing a little animation with their relevant cry. I definitely think this needs something more.

There should be something that your Pokmon gets from battle that it can't get in the wild. The way that EVs made a difference in the original games. There should be personal stuff you can do, like take pictures, play with and even feed your Pokmon. PvP could be a thing, but what about just a random meet-up with virtual pets? I think they could test out the PvP mechanic by allowing people to virtually meet. "Yattuor's Machamp wants to play!" "FatherMcNugget brought out his Alakazam!" and then you watch them walk around and do stupid things in a little enclosed environment. </TEXT>

It's just a genuinely honest post. That's it.

And I definitely agree with it because I've been in a less than ideal area since the game started with only one Pokstop within 2 or 3km of my house. I've probably seen maybe 4 great spawns in my area since the start and if there's only 3 spawns around me and the only Pokstop points to a Sandshrew instead of a Charmeleon, I'm gonna be pretty sad.

I had never experienced any resistance from a less than 100 CP Pokmon until like a month ago.

I personally think that the catch rates were fine earlier and I don't understand why they've changed it. I had my fair share of misses, evades, attacks, breakouts and, of course flees before any changes. But it all seemed fine because it was a low percentage of the time. I have almost never caught a Pokmon in one ball since about a month ago. I went from over 150 of each ball to less than 10 of each now. Despite me spinning stops every day wherever I can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely agree that there should be more music.
However, I think it might be difficult or even impossible for different biomes to have different music as most areas contain multiple biomes.

The day night thing is almost a given. And the events should always have new music. I know it's composing a new song, but it'll be reused for that event every year so it's not just a once off thing.

Although, I'd like to commend the relevant parties on the music they did put into the game. I never played with music for most of my first couple months and I got super-excited when I heard the sort of Victory Road remix that they had for gym menus. </TEXT>

Of course. The Pokdex is absolute nonsense sometimes, but it's the original "canon" information in the games, even though most of it is a bit debatable.

Haha I know plenty of examples.

One of my favourites is Gastly in Pokmon Fire Red:

 A being that exists as a thin gas. It can topple an Indian elephant by enveloping the prey in two seconds.

Firstly, since when does Gastly randomly consume large animals?

Secondly, how does it "envelop" such an animal to consume it? I never knew such an ability of Gastly before.

Thirdly, holy hell. An Indian Elephant exists in Pokmon's universe? Not like a Donphan or something. A SPECIFIC INDIAN ELEPHANT. WHAT. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Here's my question:**

We assume we'll receive Gen 2 starters because, in the future, Gen 2 is being released like a new part of the game.

But what about those that only start playing after Gen 2 comes out?

Surely they're not going to get a Gen 1 starter and then immediately after that, a Gen 2 starter? Or only a Gen 2 starter because they started playing late?

**Here's my suggestion:**

I think you should only get a Gen 2 starter and only see Gen 2 Pokmon if you're over level 5 or something.

That way, new players will be excited to play the game and then, after playing a bit to get to level 5, get even more excited to find that new Pokmon have come in and they get a new starter.

They can increment 5 levels for each future Gen.

(You need to be level 10 and above to see Gen 3 Pokmon, level 15 for Gen 4, etc.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shedinja is one of my favourite Pokmon and I'm nervous as to how he will be implemented in PoGo.

They've gone out of their way to prevent "no effect" situations in PoGo.
I assume this is mostly for casual players who will attack Gengar with Raticate and will not be able to do any damage.

I personally would prefer that the status effects and "no effect" type matches are awesome and add depth to the game as all the other RPGs work. I know it's more casual, but I still maintain that casual players aren't as interested in filling their 'dex and taking down level 10 gyms. There's much less chance of them even fighting against something impossible. Besides, you should definitely have more than one Pokmon by the time you attack a gym and therefore more than one type of attacking move.

This definitely gives some massive advantages, though. You could suddenly take down a 2500 CP Rhydon with only Ground attacks with a 10 CP Pidgey (without the timer, of course.)

I don't think they'll want Shedinja to have that power so it'll probably be pretty bad. </TEXT>

So if you have a level 30 Ditto fighting a level 10 Blastoise, you'll have much higher CP than it.

If you have a level 20, high IV Ditto and you're fighting a level 20, low IV Blastoise, you'll likely have more CP than it. </TEXT>

They added event spawn points for the Halloween event etc.

Maybe they can simply leave the Gen 1 spawn points and add Gen 2 spawn points.

I'd prefer getting more Pokmon but they really need to give us more items. With more spawns and seemingly more difficult catch rates, this is becoming a problem for everyone, let alone people that cannot get to Pokstops often.

Otherwise, if it has to be a Pokdex selection, I'd like to be able to choose National Pokdex, Kanto Regional Pokdex, Johto Regional Pokdex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly: If this is already posted somewhere, please direct me to it

I live in an area where, unfortunately, I have crappy cellphone reception a lot of the time.

I don't usually have the patience to check and calculate this, but I've been meaning to find out a few things.

How does the timing of the app's basic checks/communication etc change based on crappy connection?

By this, I mean:

If the Buddy/Egg count checks every 60 seconds (just assuming) and immediately after a successful check, it takes 12 seconds to reconnect because of bad network connection, does the next check still happen 60 seconds from the first one? Or is it now 72 seconds after the first one because it experienced 12 seconds of no connection?

What if this bad connection happens for a full 60 seconds or more? Does it completely miss one round of adding distance?

Also: Do you get back wasted items if you error out of a capture because of bad connection? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's what I remember (and my assumptions) about the restrictions on our beloved game. I don't intend for this to be taken as a serious post, nor do I expect anything to come of this. Literally just expressing something I thought about and I want to know what others think.

Anyway, here's the restrictions I remember and a couple notes on them:

* No real safety/security/cheating issues yet - Game is released - Free roaming. No proper speed caps apart from maybe obvious spoofing/impossible speeds. - Everyone happy. Some complaints from rural / less populated areas because of less spawns / stops, etc.

* Possible lawsuits, possible safety concerns - Speed cap introduced to force people to accept that they are playing as a passenger so as not to condone playing while driving. - Most people accepted this as a minor annoyance

* Bots, spoofers, cheaters - Added soft bans for spoof detection etc. - Some people (apparently) erroneously softbanned. 

* More bots, spoofers, cheaters - Added more soft bans, some full account bans. - More people (apparently) erroneously softbanned, and now some people (apparently) erroneously FULLY banned. This took a while to sort out for those that were legitimately affected.

* More people playing while driving - Incense-spawned Pokmon pretty much guaranteed to run away while over speed limits (to discourage playing while driving). - Some innocent people lose catches because of GPS drifting etc.

* More bots/spoofers/cheaters - Add safetynet restrictions to ban anyone with suspicious devices. - Many innocent players banned for having the wrong software or OS.

* Cheaters using old versions of game to avoid restrictions - force old versions to update. - Innocent players with wrong software / OS also forced to update and are no longer able to play.

* Players are still playing while driving - Added further speed cap to sightings to prevent actually catching Pokmon while driving. - Actual passengers now unable to catch Pokmon during trips. 

* Players are STILL playing while driving! - Added speed cap to Pokstops as well to prevent successfully spinning stops while driving. - Actual passengers no longer able to obtain items during trips.

**And what about the future?**

* Children are in the most danger while playing? Introduce an 18 age restriction?

* Pedestrians get knocked while not paying attention to their surroundings? Remove all spawns and Pokstops from near roads?

* Dangerous for people to play at night? Game ends at 6pm local time?

* Certain areas like South Africa report muggings while people are playing? Geo-block these areas to prevent any incidents?

* People with Android able to download / install additional apps? Ban all Android players?

* Women targeted more often than men - Ban women from playing?

Thoughts:

How many of these restrictions were actually acknowledged or explained by Niantic?

How many can be justified with regards to ONLY this game and not whether or not someone is breaking the law or being unaware of the world around them (because that's going to happen with any game - or ANY device, even. Texting does exactly the same thing!).

Where will this stop?

Can Niantic at least explain what is going on and why these restrictions are introduced?

Don't misunderstand me. I don't hate Niantic and I don't hate this game. I've played every single day since day one and I still do. I just want to know what is going on with these restrictions, why they're necessary and why Niantic can't just say "We will be introducing a speed cap to Pokstops" because I've tried to be patient and understanding each time, but it's very frustrating to keep finding new ways to play because we are being forced not to play the way we used to before. I personally believe that, whether illegal, cheating, whatever, these people are all causing their own problems for themselves and for others and I personally believe that none of this should be affecting the game this much.

I've passed a LOT of people playing games like Candy Crush, texting or even reading a NEWSPAPER in their cars while in traffic. This has never changed and it never will. I understand that there are certain reasons that this game may indirectly PROMOTE this because of the location-based play, but I think that the first few restrictions were enough and this is starting to become ridiculous because we're not getting any explanations for these changes.

EDIT: Minor text fixes (of course) to explain that this isn't some serious debate and I don't expect anyone to examine every fact in here or to prove something. It's just my opinion and thoughts and I want to know what other people think. More points added. </TEXT>

What I'd like to think is that this update means they ARE working on something, but they're trying to hold out just a little longer until Hallowe'en (which they've apparently hinted at).

I think Niantic knows the fanbase is slipping and sent out a "show of good faith" update to show that we shouldn't leave yet.

I'd like to think that at least ONE major update will happen within the next week or so.

OR the new update might have much more than they officially mentioned. We'll have to wait and see.

I think everyone shouldn't assume the worst, because I don't think Niantic intends to do this.

We're literally clicking a button that says "I'm a passenger" when we're going over a certain speed. I understand the problem of people playing and driving, but if they also stop innocent passengers from playing, that wouldn't make sense to me.

	<TEXT> So, as I said in the title, I've been defending the tracker stuff everytime someone complained and I said Niantic would be fixing things but they're starting to let me down both in my conversations and in-game.

Last night, I saw a Kabuto silhouette nearby at home (where I barely find Pokmon) and I spent 15 minutes running around my complex scanning every corner, getting strange looks from people and getting barked at by dogs and nearly crapping myself. And after 15 minutes, I could not find it. I didn't know where it was and whether I had passed meters by without knowing.

Ordinarily, I would laugh it off, but I'm on 107 in my caught Pokmon in my Pokdex and this may not be amazing to anyone, but I'm really excited about getting the last ones and it made me sad to miss one that I needed.

This morning, I couldn't find a Pikachu, even though I tried my best to track it. A few days ago, I almost missed a Venusaur and found it at the last second.

I know it's part of the game, and I'm not going to rage quit or something, but I'd really like some kind of indicator or some kind of help here. I don't want a list of co-ordinates or an arrow pointing exactly at every Pokmon. I just wish there was something that could be as helpful as the 3-step method. Even if it's a once-per-day item.  What if you used an item once per day and it worked for 30 minutes or something, similar to the lucky egg timer and it used the 3-step tracker for that time? I'm sure Niantic still has the code for it. If it's used much less often, it shouldn't be that heavy on the server. Plus, the user-base is much less now. </TEXT>

Ditto hasn't received an evolution or pre-evolution until now.
What if Gen 7 is doing that ^in ^Sun/Moon and that's why PoGo is waiting?

I know it's been suggested that we're waiting for Gen 7 before, but I haven't seen this specific reason before.

Just sharing a thought.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So this probably happens a lot to everyone, but I was really surprised today because I have bad luck finding rare Pokmon and I'm gonna post this little story.

It was actually pretty cool.

I got out of my car at work and immediately saw that there was a Venusaur nearby, so I checked that nobody from work was outside and ran a whole block down from work. I walked around for a minute or two but it dropped off the radar and I couldn't find it. Then I ran a block up from work. Dropped off the radar again. Still couldn't find it. I went across the road from my office to the shop. Dropped off the radar again. Still nothing.

Tired and sad now, I checked my app... only to see that it disappeared from my radar.

I was pretty bummed.

So I sadly trudged back to the office, already late for work, and IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OFFICE, IT POPS UP.

I did see posts saying that Pokmon disappear from your radar about a minute before they despawn, just so you don't go looking for them at that point and never find them.

So I encountered it, and 3 Ultra Balls and Razz Berries later, I have a Venusaur and a new Pokdex entry!

Wow. What a pleasant surprise.

I guess the moral of the story for me was: stop playing the game and go to work :D

(Yes, I was late. No, I didn't get in trouble, thankfully.)

UPDATE: Someone from work asked why I was running down the road. I told them I went to get something from my car but they pointed out that my car was not in that direction. I said I just needed to check something important. Then he jokingly said "We're watching you! We can always see!" and I just laughed nervously and awkwardly while he walked away, pointing at me. :/

EDIT: Specified that I checked in each direction until it DROPPED OFF THE RADAR.

VERY INTERESTING EDIT: I JUST FOUND ANOTHER VENUSAUR IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE, EXACTLY ONE WEEK LATER. What does this mean?? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Bug fix] Buddy not gaining candy </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-12 09:12:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I posted a while ago about my buddy not getting any candy after completing the cycle but I messed up the post, posted the wrong values, etc.

Don't laugh but Eevee is not common in my area, so I've been walking mine in order to get another evolution to add to my 'dex.

What would happen is that the circle in the bottom left would complete and it wouldn't even say "Eevee found a candy!"
It would just start the circle again.

I started with 18 candy and after walking it 5 cycles of 5km, I checked and I still had 18 candy. This happened within the space of a week or two and this was BEFORE update 0.41.2.

So I recently updated the app and also swapped out my buddy. After a few minutes, I thought I'd try Eevee again. Sadly, it still had 18 candy. However, I walked it for another 5km since the update, it finally said "Eevee found a candy!" and it shot straight to 22 candy!

Clearly there was a backlog or miscommunication somewhere, but it still had the correct amount somewhere. I thought I'd post my story in case anyone else experienced this too.

I'm not sure if the update fixed it or the swapping out of buddies. But if you're having the same issue, try both. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I know, this is still an outstanding issue, but I know I always lost my sound in the game every time I got a notification on my phone. But then after the first day or two, I realised it didn't happen when the phone was on silent.

So I've literally just left my phone on silent for like the last 3 months thanks to this game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two lion cubs were born. They were brothers. While they will still very young, one lion was sent to a zoo in Australia and one was sent to a zoo in Italy.

Years later, the brothers meet again and discuss their lives.

The Australian brother says:

"These guys've been good to me, mate. I've been really happy and I'm the star attraction of my zoo. I don't think any lion has it better than me!"

The Italian brother says:

"That's-a nothing! I get every single-a thing that-a you could ask for! Meat, fish, fast-a food! You name it! The only problem is they refer to me as a tiger."

The Australian brother says:

"WOW! That sounds amazing! Are you serious?"

The Italian brother looks down for a second, sighs and says:

"No, brother. I'm-a lion."

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I never saw a Hitmonchan before, so today on my way to work, I saw one nearby and actually begged the game to let me find it. I didn't really have much choice because I was in a car. Amazingly, it appeared! Then I clicked on it... and... nothing.

I just got the white spinning Pokball and then obviously, I was too far away and it disappeared. Nothing on my game loaded again as it was still stuck in that weird limbo mode where the UI disappears. So I had to restart and strangely, Hitmonchan now showed in my Pokdex as Seen. I know the encounter did not load so I don't think this should have happened.

	<TEXT> So I found a Magikarp this morning, threw a ball and instead of shaking 3 times, it waited a few seconds, popped out and showed me the flee animation.

I sighed with disappointment because I couldn't even catch a Magikarp, but then, wait a minute. It's in my Pokmon storage. And my journal said it was caught?

What?!

I'm not complaining because at least I got it, but surely that shouldn't happen.

I followed r/TheSilphRoad for a while but didn't realise where to actually assist with the Silph Community.

If you guys are willing to help add stats for Pokmon sightings and nests, please go here and report your findings:

You'll sign in via your Reddit account and you can see all the nearby nests / spawns for Pokmon in your area.

I've started contributing to South Africa where I can.

Come on, guys. Let's put some pins on that map!

I tried searching in the subreddit but didn't find this question (or answer). So when we're reporting sightings on the Silph Road website, I didn't see any checkbox for a gas station / petrol station / whatever you call it in your area.

If it is there, please point me towards it. If not, could we have the option added?

I've scanned that page and didn't see it. Maybe I'm blind? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Possible bug with egg distance? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-12 08:36:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I actually don't know if this issue happened to anyone before the update as well, but this is the first time it happened to me, so I hope it's not a bug with the new update.

Anyway, so yesterday, I had the last 0.05km to hatch my egg. It was 4.95/5.0km

I walked around a bit at home (maybe 300m or so) and I know the server usually updates your distance a few minutes later, so I waited. Then after 10 minutes, there was no change (still 4.95/5.0km), so I walked again. Still no change after another 10 minutes. I kept the app open for more than an hour. GPS drift DEFINITELY got me more than 0.05km after that as well. STILL nothing. Keep in mind, that I was still catching Pokmon, evolving Pokmon, checking nearby stops, etc and everything loaded and saved correctly. So I know my connection was fine and I wasn't accidentally soft-banned or something. Eventually, I closed the app and re-opened it and it STILL showed 4.95km/5.0km.

I walked again after restarting the app and then within like 2 minutes, my egg got the distance and hatched.

Anyone know why this happened or if this is a common occurrence?

I don't mind restarting my app to get around this, but I wasted like an hour walking around for nothing. How do you decide when you've waited too long for the server to update your egg distance?

(In case anyone wants to know, my Buddy did not get any distance during that time either. and it only got 0.1km after my egg hatched. So it definitely only counted the distance after I restarted.)

TL;DR my egg did not gain any distance until I restarted my app, even though the rest of the game was working perfectly with regards to network connections and data transfer. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA: Ivysaur Glitch </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-08 12:40:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ~~Loading Ivysaur's 3D model causes the game to go into a state that stops loading all Pokmon 3D model graphics.~~

~~This includes selecting a Pokmon adjacent to Ivysaur on your list.~~

~~Clicking a wild Pokmon in this state causes a white screen of death.~~

~~The issue can be removed by restarting the app.~~

~~I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 and I'm just explaining what I experienced, but it seems that multiple other users have reported this issue as well.~~

~~Not sure if this is temporary and I'm not sure whether it affects different phone models or iOS.~~

~~Also, I'm almost 100% certain that I've accessed my Ivysaur after the last app update so this must be a server-side issue. I only noticed it today.~~

EDIT1: ~~Seems to be an Android issue, based on user feedback. Samsung and LG users confirmed the issue while no iOS users have confirmed it yet.~~

~~Apparently anyone can experience this issue, except users with certain phone models.~~

~~In certain cases, it may be necessary to restart your phone.~~

~~For now, just assume you're included and avoid Ivysaur.~~

EDIT2: This issue seems to have been resolved. Thanks, Niantic! It only took a day or so to resolve this! I think that's pretty decent response time. Keep up the good work!

Also, the new update seems to be working pretty well. No complaints yet! </TEXT>

Everytime I find a nest, I'd like to make a note of it in-game and be able to easily find it again.

It would load the marker on the client side map so it wouldn't be extra strain on the server.

This has never happened before, even with all the bugs that were around. I've had freezing etc, but never just a random app closure.
Unfortunately, I usually leave the app running while I'm doing other stuff at work etc, so I haven't seen if something specific is causing the crash.
I'm using the Android version of the app on a Samsung Galaxy S7.
