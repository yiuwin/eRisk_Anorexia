	<TEXT> I don't think it matters that much. The program is solid: it's basically stronglifts 5x5 with biceps, triceps core and traps work. The core exercises are necessary anyway; bi's, tri's and traps are optional. They are trained at low volume and won't hurt your progress on the main lifts, and if you have the extra time and commitment they can give you better results physique-wise. I don't agree that the program is plagiarized; there are already a lot of versions of 5x5. Don't discard the program just based on the fact that Jason Blaha's name is on it.

	<TEXT> I'm sorry, I forgot to answer your first question. There is no replacement for the deadlift. If you want to develop maximal lower body strength and explosiveness, you've got to do barbell squats and deadlift.  For squats you could of course do pistol squats, but the intesity of the movement becomes too low when you progress and there isn't really a next progression. With that begint said, if you really don't want or can't train in a gym, you should do something that trains the posterior leg muscles (deadlifts also target the upper and lower back, but you train these anyway with this program. Just add some more lower back exercises if you can). Pistol squats do this to but you need more than that. I would suggest replacing the deadlifts on workout B by sprinting 30 to 100 metres for 3 to 5 sets at 85 to 100 percent effort (build the intensity up). Other great exercises are the natural hamstring curl and glute bridge progressions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Stehi. I have written some options in the template. Sphinx pushups are great since the can be progressed by moving your hands closer under your body. Bodyweight tricep extensions are also great. These can be performed with a bar/bench or with rings/suspension handles. You can look these exercises up on YouTube. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Ice Cream Fitness adapted to BWF: a beginner-intermediate full-body program. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-14 16:18:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **About the program**
This program uses the template of Jason Blaha's [Ice Cream Fitness](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=148036063 pagenumber=). I have adapted it to bodyweight training, although the lower body exercises require weights. There is a lot of controverse around Jason Blaha and he might be a total ***hole, but this is a solid program. A lot of people have had great results both physique and strength wise. It's basically the Stronglifts 5x5 program with accessory exercise for better upper body hypertrophy and structural balance. 

 nbsp;



This program is for people how have done the Recommended Routine consistently and have stalled with their progress. It still uses a full body schedule, which gives the benefit of increased training frequency, but the volume per workout is a lot higher than on the Recommended Routine, Stronglifts 5x5 or Starting Strength. The program is mostly focused on hypertrophy, but it will build a lot of strength too. If you want to improve your physique or you just need some more mass and have done a beginner routine consistently for around 6 months, this is a really good program. Another great program for intermediate levels is the [Texas Method](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3dhxyk/concept_wednesday_adapting_the_texas_method/). 

 nbsp;


**The template**


the original template can be found [here](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=148036063 pagenumber=). 

Alternate workout A and B. Train 3 times a week with at least one dat of rest *between* workout days. So it will look like this:

 nbsp

Week 1:

Monday: workout A

Wednesday: workout B

Friday: workout A

 nbsp

Monday: workout B

Wednesday: workout A

Friday: workout B


 nbsp;

**Workout A**


A1. Squat 5x5 


B1. Weighted dips / dip progression 5x3-6


C1. Bodyweight row 5x3-6 (add weight or progress to the (tuck) front lever row)


D1. 3x 5-8 (weighted) chin ups


D21. 3x 8 Tricep isolation exercise (dumbell/EZ bar tricep extensions, Sphinx pushups, bodyweight tricep extensions)


E1. Handstand shrugs / barbell shrugs 3x 8 OR farmer's carries 3x60 seconds (I strongly recommend the latter) 


G1. 2x10 posterior core exercise (hyperextensions, arch body hold, ab wheel/ring rollouts etc)

G2. 3x10-20 anterior core exercise (Hollow body hold, leg/knee raises etc.)

**Workout B**

Squat 5x5

Deadlift 1x5

Handstand pushup progression 5x3-6

Bodyweight rows 5x3-6 -10% (use a somewhat easier progression, increase rest or decrease reps) 

3x8 dips OR tricep dominant pushup variation

2x10 posterior core exercise (hyperextensions, arch body hold, ab wheel/ring rollouts etc)

3x10-20 anterior core exercise (Hollow body hold, leg/knee raises etc.)

 nbsp;

**Periodization**

This program uses linear periodization. For the weighted exercises, try to add at least 5 pounds each workout (so if you did dips 5x5 with 50 pounds on workout A on monday, use 55 pounds on the following workout A on friday).

For the bodyweight exercises you can do more repetitions, increase range of motion, or move on to the next progression. For example, you could go from a feet elevated pike pushups to handstand pushups against a wall. Just make sure you progress in *something* for every exercise every workout.


 nbsp;


**Supersets: training more efficiently**

The fact that our upper body exercises are bodyweight exercises makes that we can pair more exercises than would be possible with the original program. For example, I wouldn't superset a bent over row with a squat because they both tax the lower back and when you fatigue this can make it harder to maintain a neutral spine, and they both compress the spine. But you can superset squats with tuck front lever rows or pull ups (compressional exercise and a decompressional exercise). Doing supersets will save you a lot of time and make your workouts more efficient. You also burn more calories since you are doing the same amount of work in less time. The workouts in their original form can take A LOT of time to complete, so doing supersets is a good idea. The workouts will then look like this: 

 nbsp;

**Workout A** 


A1. Squat 5x5 


A2. Weighted dips 5x5


C1. Bodyweight row 5x3-6 (add weight or progress to the (tuck) front lever row)


D1. 3x 8 Tricep isolation exercise (dumbell/EZ bar tricep extensions, Sphinx pushups, bodyweight tricep extensions)


D2. 3x 5-8 (weighted) chin ups

E1. Handstand shrugs / barbell shrugs 3x 8 OR farmer's carries 3x60 seconds (I strongly recommend the latter) 

F1. 2x10 posterior core exercise (hyperextensions, arch body hold, ab wheel/ring rollouts etc)

F2. 3x10-20 anterior core exercise (Hollow body hold, leg/knee raises etc.)

 nbsp;

**Workout B**


A1. Squat 5x5

B1. Deadlift 1x5

C1. Handstand pushup progression 5x3-6

C2. Bodyweight rows 5x3-6 -10% (use a somewhat easier progression, increase rest or decrease reps) 

D1. 3x8 dips OR tricep dominant pushup variation

E1. 2x10 posterior core exercise (hyperextensions, arch body hold, ab wheel/ring rollouts etc)

E2. 3x10-20 anterior core exercise (Hollow body hold, leg/knee raises etc.)

 nbsp;

**Intensity**
For the main exercises (5x5) use an intensity of 80% percent of your one rep max or use your 8rm. You shouldn't go to failure, except (maybe) on the last set. Remember that you're going to workout within two days after your workout. Work hard, but don't burn yourself out. For your accessory exercises, use 75% of your 1rm or your 10 rep max. 

 nbsp;

**How to adopt the program to your level**
If you find that you recover really quickly from the workouts, you can up the frequency: you workout every two days, so one week you have four workouts and the other you have three. You could also up the intensity for the main exercises on some workouts, but dont go crazy with this. The most important thing is that you progress each workout. 

If you find that the workouts are too hard and you don't recover enough between sessions (even when you sleep enough, have good nutrition and manage your stress levels), you can drop some of the accessory exercises, but don't lower the volume on the main exercises.

	<TEXT> May I ask how you combine DUP with bodyweight exercises? What do your routines look like specifically? I am asking because usually a dup workout just uses deadlift, bench, and squat.

	<TEXT> You cut at 3500 calories? I'm a young guy too (16 actually) and have a pretty high activity level, but that would be a pretty dirty bulk for me. Is it because you are so tall and heavy, or do you have a really high activity level (what do you do all day?)?

	<TEXT> **I went from having anorexia and a super skinny body to muscular and strong with bodyweight exercises.**

*Note: I am not a native speaker, so there might be some flaws in grammar and stuff.*

Okay. I am a Dutch boy, just turned 16, weigh 56 kg / 123.5 lbs and am 164 cm / 5 feet and 5 inches *short*.

Here is a progress picture of me with exactly one year in between: http://imgur.com/Xuge9Js

Here are two recent pics:

My first freestanding handstand pushup! Was really happy after this one ;) https://youtu.be/jkEY0DkGPzs


 I started developing signs of an eating disorder a couple of months before I turned 13. I got really obsessed with healthy eating and exercising. I started eating less and less and doing intense cardio more and more. My parents were really concerned with me as I started to lose weight rapidly. They brought me to the hospital, where I went through some tests. Turned out I had a dangerously low heart rate (under 40 beats per minute, which qualified me for bradycardia) and my blood sugar levels were also extremely low. I got hospitalized and had to follow a strict meal plan. I wasn't allowed to move a limb. After 4 weeks my condition started to improve and I went back to home. I gained a lot of weight  which was mostly fat of course since I was completely sedentary  
but I started to feel better. I went for short walks and after a couple months I was allowed to pick up my sports again. But the good times didn't last forever. I fell back into old habits and lost weight again. I spent 1 year arguing with my parents, talking to psychologists , avoiding eating food and exercising obsessively. During summer last year things started to change a little bit. I started eating more and cooperated with my parents to fight my disease instead of protecting it and hiding it away from them. I got better. I started doing bodyweight exercises in February 2015, but I overdid it and didn't get a lot stronger. So, I got my shit together and looked for information on the internet. I watched videos from FitnessFAQS, Antranik, CalisthenicMovement and the like. I got inspired and got a better understanding of resistance training principles. 

The first workouts I did looked like this:
**upper body**
- 5 sets of pull ups to failure
- 5 sets of dips to failure
- 5 sets of pike pushups to failure
- 5 sets of chin ups to failure

**lower body** 
24 minutes of tabata-style HIIT with weighted jump squats, advanced versions of burpees etc. 

I did this every day, rotating between upper and lower body workouts. This obviously burned me out really quickly. 

Some of my milestones: 
 3 chin ups with 10 kg/22 pounds
 a freestand HSPU!
 7 pistol squats with a 10 kg /22 pound kettlebell (held in rack position) 

I am a lot smarter with my training now, and I made some sick strength progress, especially in comparison with what I achieved in the first months. I really hope to win a prize, since it would help me getting my training even better!

	<TEXT> Even better than a pull up bar: buy rings. You can do so much more with them than just pull ups:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AhIZkvQCwk
Even if you just use them for pull ups, they are more joint-friendly for doing so. You can attach them to a beam, a branch, a bar and to the ceiling. Bonus: they are very cheap, especially if you were to also buy dip bars (rings are very for dips).

	<TEXT> Hey man, I think of the best ways to train the OAP is with a pulley system. Watch this video by Daniel Vadnal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj1NvN7Te_s
You basically attach a weight to a weight belt or rope, throw it over the bar and use it as assistance. And then you try to decrease the weight every workout.  </TEXT>
