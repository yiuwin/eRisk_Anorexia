	<TEXT> But you surely would agree that Thanos appearing in Guardians of the Galaxy is a crossover with the Avengers even though it wasn't continuing the story from the Avengers.  For that matter, the fact that the orb contained one of the infinity stones was also a crossover in the sense it continued to set up Infinity War. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter which came first.  The Kree were introduced on Agents of SHIELD and you learn more about them in Guardians of the Galaxy.  Continuing a story from one platform to another is the very definition of crossover. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would make sense if the upcoming Inhumans series were to cross over with Agents of SHIELD.

It would make sense for Agents of SHIELD to crossover with Runaways, Cloak and Dagger or the Netflix shows.

It would make sense for Runaways, Cloak and Dagger or  the Netflix shows to crossover with Captain America or Ant Man.

Captain America or Ant Man crossing over with Iron Man or Spider-Man?  We actually had that movie less than a year ago.

Captain America, Ant Man, Iron Man and Spider-Man meeting Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy?  Yeah, that movie is coming out next year.

What would NOT make sense is for Coulson to show up on Xandar and interact with the Nova Corps.  Hell, it wouldn't even make sense for the Punisher to show up in Infinity War.  To all those people saying "Wouldn't it be cool if the Punisher showed up in Infinity War with a rattling gun and started shooting Thanos?": No.

What we need is an ideograph to show how connected things already are.  (Coulson has met the Avengers and Sif.  Doctor Strange has already met Thor.)  

Actually, technically, Agents of SHIELD has already crossed over with Guardians of the Galaxy because we have had a few episodes with the Kree and the Kree have only showed up on Guardians of the Galaxy and Agents of SHIELD. </TEXT>

The world would look a lot different if such a god actually existed.  People would go to churches when they get sick and have everybody there pray for them.  Instead we immediately rush people to hospitals because we all know, deep down, that science and technology is going to extend our lives and not some imaginary deity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed.  Just ignore what they said.  Pheromones make more sense.  I suppose at some point they had to ask "If he emits pheromones that cause people to lose their inhibitions then would people not follow ANY commands from ANYone?" but a virus doesn't make sense.  Presumably there was something hypnotic about his voice that caused people to obey him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the Agents of SHIELD series will end with Coulson dying again.  Steve Rogers becomes the new Director of SHIELD.  I find it odd that the actor playing Jeffrey Mace isn't a regular on the show.  I think Coulson will become director again before the shoe ends.  Steve Rogers will assume a role like Nick Fury did in the Avengers movies.  He can lead a team of agents including Black Widow, Hawkeye, the Winter Soldier, Falcon, War Machine, Ant Man, Wasp and Quake.  Tony Stark will have his own team which includes Spider-Man, Quasar, Nova, Ms Marvel, Kate Bishop, White Tiger, Yo-yo and Patriot and Doctor Strange will have his own team that includes Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Thor, Black Panther, Valkyrie, Namor, She-Hulk and the Hulk.  Tony Stark's team would still have to answer to a council that everybody answers to, as per the Sokovia Accords.  Maybe Tony's team can be a second team that gets sent in when the main team is not available. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't want movies with Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Lizard and Electro again.  It makes sense to introduce these characters on Netflix or not at all.  They could have origin stories for each of the villains and have each of them face Spider-Man.  Eventually, the Sinister Six comes together, perhaps when Mysterio breaks the rest of them out of jail.  I imagine they could have Mysterio and Kraven in the next Spider-Man movie so that general audiences will know who they are and they could have the Sinister Six in the third Spider-Man movie.  Tom Holland wouldn't have to appear on Netflix because Spider-Man wears a mask.  Same is true of the Vulture.  The Vulture's origin is supposedly being told in the movies so that's not a problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Moon Knight

As a follow up to The Punisher, Thunderbolt Ross recruits Frank Castle to join The Thunderbolts.  Marc Spector is also in the group.  In a mission in Egypt, things go wrong and Marc Spector becomes Moon Knight.

2. Spider-Woman

Spider-Woman was a Hydra agent who gets captured by Thunderbolt Ross' people and recruited into the Thunderbolts.

3. Elektra

Elektra is also a member of the Thunderbolts.  She, Moon Knight and Spider-Woman may have their own spin off series (plural).

4. Mockingbird, Hunter and Brother Voodoo

These three characters can complete the line up in the first season of the Thunderbolts.

5. Ghost Rider

This would be the Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider introduced on Agents of SHIELD.  Nicholas Cage could return as Johnny Blaze and be a mentor for Robbie Reyes.

6. Blade and Hannibal King

There are two possibilities: they could recast Blade and have Hannibal King be a minor character or they could bring back Wesley Snipes, recast Hannibal King and have Blade be a mentor for Hannibal King.

7. Jennifer Kale and Danny Ketch

These two characters would be supporting characters in the Ghost Rider series and they could also be part of the Midnight Sons with Ghost Rider and Blade.

8. Norman Osborn and Wilson Fisk

I picture Norman Osborn running for President with Wilson Fisk as either a political rival or running mate.

9. Dark Avengers (Abomination, Venom, Beetle, Moonstone, Blizzard, Lizard)

After the election, the Thunderbolts refuse to work for the US government so they are replaced by the Dark Avengers.  The second season of the Thunderbolts has the Thunderbolts fighting the Dark Avengers and taking down the entire administration.

10. Sinister Six (Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Vulture, Electro, Kraven, Mysterio)

The Sinister Six, if it is ever made, would work better as a Netflix series than as a movie.  Obviously arrangements would have to be made with Sony. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's a few more quick fantasies.

1) I am a male prostitute.  I service women in Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines including Western women on vacation.  I service high class clients such as pop stars, models and actresses.  These women expect discretion.  They don't want the general public to know hey are sluts.  It could damage their reputation and career.  For example, women in Korean and Japanese girl bands aren't allowed to have boyfriends.  But what do they do when they get horny?  This fantasy is perfect for jerking off to Asian pop videos or dramas.

2) I teach at a vocational college that trains women to become porn stars and prostitutes.  I literally grade the students on their ability to give blow jobs or ride my cock.

3) I take a list of the hottest women in the world (Rhianna, Selena Gomez, etc.) and I pair them off or put them in groups of three and I imagine having threesomes and foursomes.  Maybe they are roommates and I'm their landlord and I'm coming to collect the rent.

4) I'm on a space ship but I wake up seventy years too early so I (spoiler alert) also wake up Rhianna.  Added bonus, when I am done fucking her I can put her back in stasis and wake up Selena Gomez and so on.

5) This one is a bit awkward: I imagine that I can clone any famous actress or singer, say Scarlett Johansson for example.  Thing is, the clone won't have the memories of the original woman.  It would be like fucking a newborn baby who happens to look like a famous adult.  I had this fantasy after seeing the Island but I eventually realized that it would be simpler to have a sex robot that looks like Scarlett Johansson.  Clones have to be fed whereas sex robots can run on rechargeable batteries.

6) I am a judge for the reality TV show Asia's Next Top Porn Star.  Not only do they do photoshoots but they also do sex scenes and I get to participate in sex scenes with the finalists to help pick the winner.

7) I am the host of a late night talk show.  Famous female celebrities perform sex acts on me live on TV.

8) I co-star in porn videos with famous actresses, models or singers.

It occurs to me that women probably aren't interested in men's fantasies, especially the nerdy sci-fi fantasies.  Women probably want to know if the couple is in a relationship, if they are in love, etc. and they want to know if anyone is dominating or being submissive.  Men just care about nudity and sex acts.  Men's fantasies tend to be to the point because we have these fantasies while we are masturbating and need to cum quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a dream last night about you.  Seriously.

First of all, I feel I need to explain.  I was told back when I was in school that, in some parts of Africa, fat women are considered desirable and that having a fat wife is a sign that a man is wealthy.  This is apparently true.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2364060/Force-fed-husband-How-Mauretanian-women-fattened-like-foie-gras-geese-dangerous-animal-growth-hormones-satisfy-mens-love-larger-lady.html

Anyway, in my dream I was a bigamist and you and Rihanna were my wives.  We traveled to Africa and the local men were laughing because I ONLY had two wives.  They also said that my wives were really skinny.  One guy said that his wife was heavier than both my wives combined and he challenged me to a weigh off to prove his point.  You and Rihanna didn't speak the local language and you were confused about what was going on so I explained that the locals wanted to know how much you weighed and the two of you went along with it.

Anyway, they weighed the guy's wife and she was pretty heavy.  Then it was your turn.  You and Rihanna were going to be weighed together.  You and Rihanna were wearing heavy jewelry, however, and some of the locals complained.  They began to chant in English "Take it off!  Take it off!".

Well, then, of course, because neither of you understood what they were saying until that point, you misunderstood and both started stripping off everything in an amazingly erotic fashion.  The locals fell dead silent.  

The moral of the story is that it doesn't matter how many wives you have or how heavy they are: what matters at the end of the day is how hot she is / they are.

This was an actual dream I had last night.  I kid you not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Confession time.  I remember in Montreal, I fell for this tanned Korean dancer named Diana.  I remember I said to her one time, "Oh, man, when I see you naked like this, do you know what goes through my mind?" and she said "Yes, I can imagine" with a facial expression that put me off a bit.  I was about to say that I imagined lying her down and fucking her hard but she obviously didn't want to hear that.  But, yeah, you do need to tease the customers a bit.  If the customers can't control themselves and try to grab you then that's when the bouncers kick them out.  Not that I was ever kicked out.  Basically, I would get to see what I wanted to see and then jack off when I got home.  (This was back when I was a university student and not something I've been doing recently.) </TEXT>

That has to eat away at a person's self esteem.  Now if you look at them with a stern face (and you said yourself that you don't like people very much) then this is actually going to make them feel bad.  They are not going to want to comeback to the club and this affects your bottom line.  It also affects the club's bottom line because they are also making less money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally had a hard time getting through Jessica Jones so I would say DD S2  DD S1  JJ  LC.  Basically the last two episodes of Jessica Jones were better than the last two episodes of Luke Cage.  Some consideration has to be given to the fact that Luke Cage was featured quite prominently in the last two episodes of Jessica Jones.  Luke Cage was, to a great extent, a sequel to Jessica Jones in that we learned more about Reva Conners and what was on that flash drive.

I preferred Season 2 of Daredevil to Season 1 because there was more going on: Season 1 had Stick, the Hand and Kingpin but Season 2 also had Punisher and Elektra.  Again, Season 2 was clearly a natural progression from Season 1.  We even had Irish gangsters in Season 2 to replace the Russian gangsters in Season 1 and a stairwell fight in Season 2 to replace the hallway fight in Season 1.  </TEXT>

I don't think they could but I think Ari Arad is talking about pitching a Namor movie to Marvel Studios, having them do it in Phase 4 and then having Universal distribute it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Mark Ruffalo has also teased a more conscious Hulk, indicating that the relationship between Bruce Banner and his alter ego is transforming. 

"When asked how that may play out in the film, Waititi replied, It's interesting, because at the moment, there's a big conversation that's happening about how far to push that. Whether or not The Hulk should be [verbal/conscious].

"I think a lot of those conversations have more to do with what's going to come up in future movies, Waititi continued. So I think a lot of those decisions are larger group decisions, rather than anything to do with just me or the writer. They have a lot of stuff that they have to consider. But I do think that's the best way to track it. I think we all want that. I think we all want to see that development and the evolution of that character. I also think you can do it in a fun way." </TEXT>

 A lot more people have access to Netflix around the world than HBO.

As of December 2015, HBO had an estimated 131 million subscribers worldwide. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, Netflix had more than 75 million streaming subscribers. It isn't even close. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At some point they need to establish separate Avengers teams so that Avengers movies don't have 20 characters each.  

First of all, Captain America and Iron Man, assuming neither of them are killed in Infinity War. These guys have been the focus of eight movies already. Even if the actors weren't expensive, we are going to want to shift the focus to younger actors who can lead their own franchises in the future.

Captain America is going to have a role in the newly reformed SHIELD. Perhaps Jeffrey Mace steps down as Director of SHIELD and Captain America becomes Director of SHIELD. He would take over the role in the movies previously filled by Nick Fury. They might even be able to finally get a Captain America cameo on Agents of SHIELD.

Tony Stark in the comics became Secretary of Defense. 2016 was an election year and if President Ellis did not get re-elected then Thunderbolt Ross is probably not Secretary of State so Tony Stark could take over that role. It does seem silly though making the one person who needs the most oversight the actual overseer.

Black Widow is supposed to be getting her own movie in Phase 4. Most likely it will involve aliens or time travel or aliens and time travel and it will set up the next major Avengers movie. If Ghost in the Shell becomes a franchise then she could be busy. Expect a Black Widow movie, if it happens, to be a one off, not because she isn't popular but because there aren't a lot of good Black Widow stories from the comics.

Captain Marvel's movie, if successful, will become a trilogy. It is very unlikely that they will introduce her and immediately kill her off so expect her to be around for a while.

Ant Man and the Wasp will also be in the New Avengers. Marvel likes making trilogies so imagine Ant Man 3 will have Taskmaster as the villain (if he is not already slated to appear in Ant Man and the Wasp). Another possible villain would be Egghead. Better yet, they could have Egghead be the villain for the flashbacks with Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne and then have Egghead appear at the end as an old man and have him be behind whatever problem they face in present day.

War Machine will stay in the Avengers. In case you missed it, Rhodey was walking at the end of Civil War and even if he is limping for the rest of his life, he doesn't need his legs to operated the War Machine suit.

Falcon, likewise, will remain in the New Avengers. I don't expect Winter Soldier to return. He is a bit of a one note character, what with his metal arm and all. Yes, it might be good to see him redeemed but he also deserves a chance at a normal life.

Tom Holland is signed on for two more Spider-Man movies after Homecoming but the actor is still young so I suspect he could do as many as nine Spider-Man movies when all is said and done, not including Spider-Man centric Avengers movies. Most likely though the MCU will get rebooted after he's done just six solo movies so they can do more movies with Spider-Man in high school (and with what will by then be a cheaper actor).

Nova and/or Quasar will probably be introduced during Infinity War. If they are both introduced then they will complete the roster of the New Avengers for now, although obviously they could add characters like Ms. Marvel later.

Dr. Cho and Prof. Selvig will remain as supporting characters. Jane Foster and her friends won't be seen again.

Thor will probably stay in Asgard and it makes sense for the Hulk to also stay in Asgard. The Hulk is probably still wanted for what happened in Johannesburg. Most likely if Hulk and Thor appear again it will be because Doctor Strange went to Asgard to get them.

Doctor Strange 2 is supposedly going to feature Nightmare. Doctor Strange 3 may very well have Dormammu return and Doctor Strange will call on the help of the Avengers including Hulk and Thor. It would be good if they could also have Namor appear. If you've read any Marvel comics from the seventies then you know why.

Valkyrie is going to appear in Thor Ragnarok along with Thor, Hulk and Doctor Strange. She is also a major character from the seventies.

The New Avengers are a bit crowded so I can see Hawkeye hanging out with Doctor Strange. First of all, I can see Hawkeye, as a SHIELD agent, being asked to look into this magic stuff that Doctor Strange is doing. Expect a lot of reaction shots from Jeremy Renner when Doctor Strange does cool stuff.

Similarly, the Black Panther is the king of Wakanda. He isn't going to hang out in New York with the New Avengers. If anything, Doctor Strange will go grab him when he is needed.

She-Hulk is a character that can join Doctor Strange's Mighty Avengers. Basically, the Leader will use Bruce Banner's blood to make Hulks but Jennifer Walters will fight on the side of good.
Scarlet Witch may seek out Strange's help to control her powers. It isn't clear if her magic is really different from Doctor Strange's magic. Presumably he and Wong can teach her to do new things.

Tina Minoru, if she didn't die off screen in Doctor Strange, could potentially be one of the Mighty Avengers. She would take the place of Clea and could potentially be a love interest for Doctor Strange. She could also be the guardian of the Hong Kong Sanctum and thus Strange's equal. We also don't know who the new guardian of the London Sanctum will be. It could be Doctor Druid or it could be Brother Voodoo. My vote is for Doctor Druid and have Brother Voodoo show up in some other capacity.

Sif, Heimdall, the Warriors Three and the Guardians of the Galaxy would show up as supporting characters in future films.
Future MCU storylines could involve a Fisk presidency, an Osborn presidency, the Skrulls, Korvac, Avengers from the future coming back in time or a Kree / Xandar war.

There's also the question of who gets what Infinity Stone after Avengers: Infinity War. I imagine Strange keeps the time stone, Asgard gets back the stone from the tesseract, Captain Marvel keeps a stone, the Guardians keep a stone and the other two stone would most likely be guarded by Tina Minoru (if she's still alive) and Doctor Druid. They could also rebuild the Vision and have him guard the Mind Stone. I think killing the Vision in Infinity Wars and then using the Infinity Stones to rebuild the Vision creates the feeling that there are no consequences. You would also have to ask why the Scarlet Witch would bring back the Vision and not Quicksilver.

It would be cool if Guardians 3 ended with the Guardians using an Infinity Stone to freeze the Kree and Xandar armies and then send them back to their respective planets so that they can give negotiations a chance. Of course, that begs the question as to why they were fighting in the first place. Why were they fighting in the past? What were the issues?

Eventually, the current actors will become too old. There's no need to panic however. Feige seems bound and determined to tell all the old Avengers stories from the past. The TV shows are rapidly becoming their own thing. The most likely TV / movie crossover would be to have Wilson Fisk and Norman Osborn working together. Or maybe they will be trying to take each other out. Just don't expect a movie with hundreds of characters because it just wouldn't be worth the effort. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are the going to bring back Olicity?  Sure.  Because it's a TV show. And here's the thing, here's the bottom line: You don't always get what you want.  Sitting there, feeling unhappy about the state of the show... They're still on the air; they're still having moments of quality. It could be cancelled.  I mean, couldn't it?  And if Laurel is Black Siren?  Well, that's an improvement, isn't it?  The comic book character has powers and so should Black Canary on the show.  Arrow is about more than just Olicity and if you let it become just that one thing, you miss the bigger picture. Does that make sense?  I mean, if Ollie and Laurel walk off into the sunset then what happens next?  Same with Ollie and Felicity.  Arrow saving the city is always going to be more important than who Ollie is sleeping with.  I'm more interested in seeing what new characters DC is going to let them use in the coming year and how they are going to use those characters in the next crossover. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think men, as a general rule, feel frustrated that they can't have sex any time they like or, for that matter, with anyone they like.  If a man is in a monogamous relationship then he has to wait until his partner is in the mood.  One solution would be to marry someone who is horny all the time but, frankly, that can get exhausting after a few months.  An AI sex robot would be ideal because you could literally turn it on when you need to relieve a sexual urge.  It would also be prohibitively expensive.  Under the circumstances, I'm sure you would understand where I am coming from when I say I sometimes fantasize about owning sex slaves or, equivalently, having access to a brothel full of pre-paid hookers. </TEXT>
