	<TEXT> So let's make this short.. 

I'm planning to start hitting the gym for the first time since I've been vegan (of 1 year). 

I'm calling out to reddit to ask what things should I be looking for to make sure I don't harm my body but give it what it needs to build adequate muscle. Should I take certain vitamins and should I use a protein power? Anyone recommend a workout plan or a meal plan? 

I'm a novice so sorry if this question seems vague, many thanks in advance. 

Keep saving lives /r/vegan! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The term I think you're referring to is cognitive dissonance! 

Here's a good article that talks about it!

	<TEXT> If you think it's right then there should be no one to tell you otherwise! 

My parents were dead against me going vegan, I ruined their Christmas and I'm ruining myself as well.. 

I know that I'm going to live my life the same way just not eating animal products.. It's no biggie, my body will function the same, my brain thinks the same, nothing changes.. 

Just think how many lives you've spared, always makes me happy! 

Be vegan and proud!

	<TEXT> The article looks at cognitive dissonance which all people who eat meat have. They know killing animals is inhumane but because everyone does it, it's ok! Mass ignorance, mass peer pressure and mass uninformed populous..  </TEXT>

Why don't gyms show up on your journal? Attempts on gyms should be included too!

I say attempts as I've never got a win yet.. 

Also why can't I see where I caught my pokemon? No map shows...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look at these four cases in German, personally it's quite interesting how they work, super interesting!

The Dative, The Accusative and The Genitive and the Nominative. 

Check out this site for more clarification, it's a lot of writing otherwise!

If they are attacking you with a group of marines and they have tanks behind, how are you going to attack through the units?

	<TEXT> Hello everyone, there seems to be so many posts recently regarding people losing accounts and no longer being able to access them. 

Due to this I've written all my RS details down, including my ISP, my IP, addresses and everything.. I would recommend other users do the same. 

Don't want to keep hearing guys and girls are losing accounts! Keep on RS'ing.

Something along the lines of what could be heard from the base. Aaron said *nothing can be heard at all*,
