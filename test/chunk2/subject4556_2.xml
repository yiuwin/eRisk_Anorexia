	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Regarding the Yellow Jacket Amazon exclusive for Canadian at least.

Alright, so I decided to talk to the Amazon.com Customer service to see if the shipping date was an error or just back ordered but seems like it is correct.


The guy I was talking to upgraded my order from Standard to Global Priority shipping and waived off my shipping so I got upgraded shipping and free shipping!


The shipping date went from Nov 11th-18th to Nov 3rd-5th.
My order went from $36.36 to $29.38 with upgraded free shipping.


I ordered it on May 28th since that was the date they offered International Shipping.


Who knows, maybe it might change to July and I just got free shipping and Priority shipping upgrade for free as well : ) </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-05-13 08:29:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Finale has been aired and we have learned all these things so far from the end of Agent of Shield season 2.


**HYDRA**

Ward is going to be the next head for the Hydra threat from the TV side in the MCU. Just like how Whitehall was the TV threat and Baron Strucker was the movie threat. 

So leading up to Phase 3, Ward is going to be the Hydra head for TV while Baron Zemo is going to be the Hydra head for the movies.




**Mister Hyde**

We got a nod of Mister Hyde aka Cal but he has gone through the Tahiti project and is now living his live as a Vet. 

**Inhumans**

Terrigen crystals were released into the ocean and the fish that got the Terrigen mist got made into fish oils and are out in the public so this could be the start of the Terrigen Mist "Bomb" of the MCU. 

Expect more of the Inhumans to pop up and to play a bigger role in the Phase 3.


**Secret Warriors?**

With Coulson asking Skye to build a team and lead a team with gifted individuals this could be MCU's paving way for the Secret Warriors. 

Also Bobbi, Mockingbird might be getting some upgrades from the blueprints Coulson has printed out. 



**Kree Invasion?**

The unknown Kree weapon has consumed Jenma, for all we know this could be setting up for War of Kree vs the Inhumans with the Terrigen Mist being released into the public. 


**Star Wars Tribute**

Coulson hand got cut off.

Coulson folder was named [Caterpillars](http://i.imgur.com/KhzxO3j.jpg) which is indeed the code name for [Secret Warriors](http://marvel.wikia.com/Caterpillars_%28Earth-616%29)

Also Bobbi, Mockingbird might be getting some tech upgrades ~~from the blueprints Coulson has printed out~~ if they decide to make sure she stays in the field as Mockingbird.

	<TEXT> Anybody else disappointed with how the Hydra heads are so underused and "killed off" easily just because the entire 3 phases are leading towards Thanos?

**Hydra Heads:**

**Red Skull** although has a possiblity coming back in the Infinity War with the theory of how the Infinity Stones actually absorbed the big bads in the movies - Red Skull, Malekith, Ronan and Ultron. 


But the other two heads: 

**Whitehall aka the Kraken** in the comic book got "killed" off in AoS even though he has Skye's mother DNA in him which would make him almost immortal.

And **Baron Von Strucker** got killed off by Ultron just because Ultron was sending a message. I wanted to see more of his experimentation and such but now List has to continue Hydra head.

Whitehall and Red Skull could make a come back in the future but I don't know how Baron Von Strucker can come back.


I really wanted the Hydra heads to stay alive because they can actually oppose an ongoing threat to SHIELD and to the street level heroes but they get rid of them so early and easily it is disappointing that we don't get to see them develop into their comic counterparts.

Now people might say for Hydra, there will always be another leader! "Cut off one head, two shall take its place" but it isn't right for them to throw away such interesting Hydra heads without development. 

Anybody else feel the same? I feel like all the "minor" villains are just getting killed off because they don't want to drag them on and focus on Thanos.

Kind of understand their point but so many villains are so underused. 


Just my rant with how MCU handles villains. 

Hopefully they will change this once the Infinity Story line is done.


**tl;dr**: MCU just throws away and kill off interesting villains before they can get real development to not confuse the viewers and drag on villains so they can focus on Thanos, just a rant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ward had Sunil Bakshi under his control and had Bakshi's allegiance under him from Hydra's. He was using Johann Fennhoff aka Doctor Faustus's mind control technique which Whitehall used.

As a mercenary type of a guy, that is very dangerous and useful at the same time.

I like to think of Ward as Deadpool esq in the MCU.  </TEXT>

Lootcrate customer service is awesome!


So I ordered the December Lootcrate box when it was on sale and received it 2 weeks ago and the Joker Batman-Batman box was came damaged and dinged up so I decided to message Lootcrate about the dinged up box and they decided to send me another box with shipment label created for the replacement Box!


I decided to look into the Pop since I am getting another box and discovered that it came with paint flaws on his head and his mouth so I messaged them again and they decided to just give me another Pop! So another shipment label was created for the replacement Pop!


I thought to myself that they would just cancel the replacement box and send me the replacement Pop! but they sent both!
Now I am ended up with 2 The Joker Batman-Batman and 1 Empty box!
