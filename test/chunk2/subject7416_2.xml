	<TEXT> I think there are many reasons for it, one of them is that culturally speaking alcohol is way more accepted than other types of drugs, to the point where we at least in the western world think about being able to buy alcohol legally as a passage into adulthood. And since it has been legal for such a long time, it might be weird to some people to categorise with illegal substances.

	<TEXT> Well it doesn't matter if you see little wrong in it, because it is still innapropriate. So when you decide to say that someone is attractive unlike most of people of their skin colour, you are implying that you think they are less attractive than white people... which is kinda racist. 

And if you don't feel that way, just don't mention someone's skin colour, like unless you're socially inept this really shouldn't be hard for you to understand.  </TEXT>

Like I am sure he would want me to watch his movies on the best format possible, and ideally something better than my mac, but that is what I gotta work with.

I do agree with what he is saying though, but I am not going to tell anyone how to enjoy movies, so if they like watching it on their phones then I don't mind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't mind other people doing it, because if they enjoy movies that way the more power to them, but I just don't like it honestly. Like it is not about it being a discredit to cinema or anything like that, it is just an unpleasant format to watch anything besides youtube vids on in my opinion. I just don't feel immersed when I watch anything on a phone, and I can't really concentrate, and there is no comfortable way to watch it. 

So yeah, I think watching movies or TV shows on my phone sucks, but not for any meaningful reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah the only way I would start using other websites would if a substantial  amount of creators that i enjoy left youtube for one specific site,which is equally as good as youtube. But right now I can't think of any other video hosting sites that are as polished, nice to look at, and as easy to navitage and use as Youtube. I know people love to complain about youtube, but it is still the best website of it's kind. 

I think my biggest fear though is that if people do more over to a different site, that it is only the big names that will benefit from it. Like I don't know if smaller channels and new ones will do better if a split happens.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It absoutely is a reason to ban someone, and if you're banned from a sub it is clear that you aren't wanted there, so if you insist on making alt accounts to bother the people on that sub than you are the problem. And there are plenty of subs where you can have those discussions, but not all of them are intended to discuss those sort of things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It honestly still seems like a joke to me, like I still can't wrap my head around Donald Trump being president, it just seems like a gag in a TV show or a youtube sketch. And like so many of the people he works with are equally absurd and silly, Sean Spicer is his own parody, and alternative facts and fake news literally sound like satire. 

Like they are both cartoon villains, and also a part of a big and weird and unplesant joke.  </TEXT>

It is not good or important enough for it to be a good idea, like if it was a significant enough movie it would make sense for them to keep it in print, but it really isn't.

	<TEXT> How it is disturbing? Either you don't know what harassment is, or you deliberately miscategorised it, so either you lied or you were just wrong. Because again, it isn't harassment, that is not up for debate. If tou are not being slandered or disparaged, and nobody is attacking you, then isn't harassment. 

I don't confuse the issue, I just don't think the mods are responsible for echo chambers, they are just trying to prevent bad behaviour. If there is enough reason to suspect that you cannot be trusted, then that is perfectly reason to ban you. Like for an instance if you post on anti-LGBTQ subs, (not saying you do) then why should you be allowed to post on pro-LBGTQ subs? Isn't there reason to suspect that you are there solely to harass people? 

And it is nothing like doxxing as no personal information is being brought up and spread around, going through your post history might be shitty, but it ain't anything like doxxing.

	<TEXT> It honestly sounds unreal, like the idea of people not only voting for Donald Trump but also aggressively worshiping him still sounds unreal to me, like if you told me this 5 years ago I would have laughed at it. I mean just think about it, there are actually people out there who honestly believed that Donald Trump, someone who has been a laughing stock for decades, was the best person to lead a country. 

The bigotry and fear mongering and anti-intellectualism of the far-right is the least suprising thing about the current state of things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saying that they harass people when they don't is a lie, because banning people from a sub isn't a form of systemic harassment, that is just false. So yeah it is a lie. 

And I just don't buy it, because the echo chamber is not at the fault of moderators, it is our (as in the users) fault. Because even in subs where you don't get banned because of guilt by association, people still upvote and downvote based on whether or not they agree with us. The mods wanting to protect people from harassment is not that big of a deal in comparison. If people over at the that sub didn't harass people, they probably wouldn't have to deal with any of this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That isn't harassment though, so you're just lying.. and I do think they should be allowed to ban you, because nobody is entitled to post in a sub, if mods don't think you belong then there is nothing wrong with that. It might be unfair to some, but if they have reasons to believe that there is a link between harassment and subscribes of certain subs, then I support it.  </TEXT>
