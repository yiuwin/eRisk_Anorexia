	<TEXT> Breakfast: (1) large Apple [~100 cal]

Lunch: A bowl of puffed wheat cereal (~110 cal), 1/2 table spoon agave nectar (~40 cal), and almond coconut milk (~50 cal) [~200 cal]

Dinner: Eating out with s/o and his friends. I'm probably going to get the veggies and hummus, which eyeballing it I would say is 300-500 calories, I'll get a better estimate later.

Snacks: Not sure, I may eat a banana and an apple since I'm going to fast tomorrow but I'm not sure Def gonna try and stay under 1000 today though.

Total so far: ~350 (I added 50 just to be safe)
Goal/planner total: ~700-1000 cal </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try peppermint and ginger tea. Lots of it. And maybe snack on some prunes or any dried fruit. Fasting is horrible for digestion. If you can, try to sleep a lot and lay on your stomach. Good luck and hope you feel better soon! :~) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I started fasting with my boyfriend on Wednesdays. He does it for religious purposes, but I do it because I want to lose weight. I've just moved out to go to college and I'm 16--I started eating more because I need to know I can take care of myself, my trade off is picking up intermittent fasting to feel less guilty. Well, my parents found out and are really upset. They asked me why and I said "For self control" and my dad said, "I don't think you have the self control to eat a decent meal for once" and it just really hit me. No matter what I do, I feel shame and guilt, and I always lack control. I either lack the control to eat well or I lack the control to not eat. I lack the control to not be consumed by my fear of gaining weight and food. No matter what, I have no control and I'm ashamed. I don't even know how to eat like a normal teenage girl, I just don't know. Do any of you all feel similar?
Also--im afraid I don't know how to add a flair to a post on mobile? can someone tell me? I only get on reddit for this community. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cantaloupe - 186 cal per small melon. I love having a big bowl of cantaloupe for breakfast. Its filling, low in calories, super hydrating, and really sweet.

Puffed Wheat - 50 Calories per cup! I'll have this for breakfast with either light vanilla soy milk (70 cal per cup) or almond milk (50 cal per cup) and a squirt of organic honey (~30 cal)!

Sweet Potato (100 cal) + table spoon of powder peanut butter (25 cal) + some organic honey (~30-60 depending on how much) + cinnamon + stevia (~5 cal). This is one of my favorite dinners!

Roasted Organic Beets - one is about 50 cal, maybe a little less but I always round up. I buy them at a local homegrown grocery store. they're decently sized and I just cut them up and put them in the oven, sprinkle on some garlic and have it for dinner!

Toasted kale/seaweed - the brand I get is like, 30 calories per package and it's pretty good! it really like, satisfies that "greasy processed fatty food" craving.

Carrots and Salsa - depends on how much you eat, but they're both low in calories. the salsa I get is like ~5 per tablespoon and carrots are 35 cal per serving. I eat this stuff the same way people eat chips-mindlessly :/

Cauliflower and olives - not sure the calorie counts for these items! but I used to eat this everyday for lunch when I was a competitive swimmer. they somehow taste good together.

Boiled egg whites - not sure the calorie count here either, sorry!! but it's really good with sriracha sauce which is also super low calorie, correct me if I'm wrong but I think it's ~5 cal per serving.

picks are also great as they are really low calorie!
also, Sara Lee makes really good bread that's 45 calories per slice!

protip: I put sriracha sauce on my salads as it satisfies my dressing cravings and spicy foods decrease appetite! :~) I tend to make my food too spicy so I can't handle eating as much. it works wonders. happy holidays everyone!

	<TEXT> it's hard, but the food will digest and you'll lose the water weight and you'll wake up tomorrow morning and the sun will be out and the binge will be history! I know it sounds cliche. but my mood is always best in the morning--so looking forward to the morning is always what helps me get over eating a lot. just look forward to a time you really like and try not to beat yourself up over one meal. stay strong!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When the laxatives kick in while you're in public

When the laxatives don't work cos you haven't eaten enough food in the past week to actually get rid of anything

When you binge and you're bloated and you know there's no reasonable way you could've gotten /that/ fat over the course of an hour but you're devastated and paranoid anyway.

Lying to your friends and family

Having people comment on your diet like "Jeez! You're so healthy!" lol 

When a woman working at a store recommends you try on a small or medium instead of extra small and it wrecks your self esteem for the foreseeable future.

Going into a binge cycle and feeling like you no longer have the right to say you have an eating problem and feeling pathetic and chubby and like a cow and out of place on ED forums.

Feeling guilty for thinking you might have a problem cos there are always people who have it worse and I may just be over exaggerating.

Doing nothing but sleeping cos your head fucken HURTS

Trying to live off fruit

Being a vegetarian or vegan because of your guilt complex

I'll think of more later  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My go to oatmeal is either plain instant, maple brown sugar instant, or rolled oats--depends on my mood. I make it with a lot of water and then add peanut butter OR peanut butter powder, stevia, cinnamon, honey, a pinch of salt, and sometimes some soy milk. I've also tried mashing a banana into mine before--it's good, but not something I do often. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> hi everyone </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone! My real name is shorthand for an eating disorder--which is fitting, but I don't like it much. I'm Mia. I am 16 years old and have had eating issues on and off for the past 2 or 3 years. I know my dissatisfaction with my body dates back to age 11, but the problems didn't start until I was around 13 or 14.
Anyway, I recently moved to a boarding school where I take dual credit classes on a college campus. I had to quit competitive swimming, which I had been passionate about for the past four years, and a lot more junk is being shoved in my face and my will is breaking.
My mom has known about my weirdness towards food, but she's never pushed me towards getting help. In a way, its always sucked that my parents didn't notice my problem much--other than attempting to urge me to eat more, they never really did anything. Now that I've moved out, my mom says if I can't take care of myself she'll make me come home. Being at this school means everything to me, so I can't let that happen.
So, I made an attempt to eat more.... and more and more and more. And now--I think I'm at 120. I can't bring myself to step on a scale. This past week I've been running less and eating more and I'm really starting to feel utterly and miserably disgusted with myself. I don't think my fatness is a distorted body image anymore. I just binged on chocolate and attempted to purge but just couldn't. I don't know why I can't make myself throw up but it just won't happen.
Anyway, I just started this first real, heavy period I've had since I was like, 14. It's... weird and I'm craving things and I hate the way I look.
I still have a thigh gap, but my stomach is swollen and ugly and I feel so grotesque. I can't stop crying now and i don't know what to do with myself.
I used to feel so dainty and little at 105lb, I miss it. I miss being light headed and even though I still wasn't skinny enough then, I miss it. I feel like I've lost all control of my life. I don't know what to do anymore but I feel so miserable and ugly and worthless.
I just want to be a normal teenager, I don't want to think about food all the time.
I'm sorry for coming here and ranting like a whiny pathetic bitch but that's really all I am.
I don't know what to do. I'm so unhappy and I don't know what to do. </TEXT>
