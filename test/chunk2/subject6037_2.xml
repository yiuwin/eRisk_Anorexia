I guess it's pretty clear how he feels about what was done to his character. Rightfully so. I'm sure many actors get attached to their roles, invested in them and perhaps see them as an extension of themselves. Understandable especially if you've been playing it for years and components of it resonant with you personally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've seen the first episode of "Thirteen". I plan on watching the remainder.

Thus far it reminds me of the American television show "The Family", which was on ABC with Joan Allen this past year. In that show their son returns home after having been abducted for many years. Unfortunately it was cancelled. There were a lot of plot holes but it was still enjoyable to watch IMHO.

It's also a bit like the film "Room" but both "Thirteen" and "The Family" take place when the child is older and has been freed.  </TEXT>

The plastic has a lip at the edge (see photo I posted) making it very hard to start the and keep the saw at the right spot.

	<TEXT> Yes, quite valid. 

I'm starting to wonder about what the writers are thinking regarding Jude. First there was the hints he might be trans. I guess he doesn't wear nail polish anymore?? Then that he was gay, for a brief period he was interested in a girl or was that him trying to be straight? Wasn't there supposed to be a storyline about him becoming religious after that other foster kid was killed? It seems like some storylines have been dropped.

I also there was some type of drama behind the scenes either with these actors or maybe their mothers who are on set as per the rules for minors. Both knew their sons would be playing gay characters but that doesn't mean they liked where the storyline went or might have had some personal friction.

Edit to add: Agreed a relationship between two 14 year olds wouldn't have lasted. But they didn't have to write Connor off the show so abruptly, definitively and in a way that seemed a bit forced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read different things online and I think there could be a few issues going on here.

One had to do with the mother of the actor (Gavin MacIntosh) who played Connor. I understand she didn't like what was going on at the set. Some of this may have had to do with the other actor (Jake T. Austin) that was playing Jesus. I'm not sure how much sense this makes as I don't think Connor and Jesus had many, if any scenes together. And Gavin MacIntosh left the show after Jake T. Austin so if he was an issue presumably it was resolved. Maybe it was/is just an overall difficult set. 

If it is the actual storyline I don't think it's really all that unprecedented. Other shows like Degrassi had teenagers in same sex relationships years ago. As for more contemporary comparisons to shows like Pretty Little Liars one of its characters Emily (Shay Mitchell) become involved with another girl while in high school. I don't know what age the characters were supposed to be but the actors portraying them are in real life much older than those playing Jude and Conner. 

So perhaps it's because the two young actors on The Fosters are much closer in age to the characters they portray and that's what really issue. It's freaking people out because they are actually that young. It's fine for Shay Mitchell whose portraying Emily on Pretty Little Liars to make out with another girl because she really wasn't 14 or 16 years old when that storyline was depicted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought the whole idea of having Donna stand up for herself, quit working for Josh, get hired by Will Bailey on Russell's campaign (presumably because he saw she had a skill set), basically excel (with a few missteps) in that role and end up working in the Santos campaign was to demonstrate there was more to her than maybe even the viewers were aware of. So I can see the writers trying to acknowledge her growth and provide her character with a career trajectory. As for Amy in that job when Abbey Bartlet was FLOTUS - I thought she was overqualified and not suited to the position at the time. So did the writers in the end ;)

I think there was some schmaltziness in the way they tried to wrap up the storylines. For example, Annabeth Schott as First Lady's Press Secretary. I'm assuming the character was qualified. I just feel like they were trying too hard to wrap everything up in a nice bow.

I don't think anyone was hired as Press Secretary. The last person in that position was Will and we know he left. Any suggestions for that job?

Here's a list of characters that includes reference to their status at the end of the show:

	<TEXT> Yes, I though that too! It seems like a respectable position but I thought Donna deserved a job that had a more direct role in relation to governing, especially since it's not clear whether this First Lady (Helen Santos) would have her own policy agenda or take a more ceremonial role. It felt like to me that Donna was going to end up handling the FLOTUS' schedule and being wasted in that position. 

I also didn't like what they did with Ronna Beckman by giving her Debbie Fiderer's job as Executive Secretary to the President. I thought she served as a strategist during the campaign and would work in the White House in a position that suited those skills.

Also what happened to Louise "Lou" Thornton? They managed to find a role for Amy Gardner in the Santos administration. I guess we are to assume Lou wasn't interested. 

The last episode was very much a wrap up for all the characters, even the smaller roles. Some of it felt forced though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, I just re-watched that part of S7E1. It takes place 3 years later. 

CJ and Danny are living in Santa Monica. 

Bartlet to Toby, "How's Columbia"?, Toby states, "Not such a bad place to spend some time". I had assumed it was the university but I guess it could be the country due to the way it's worded. Makes less sense though.

There's no information provided about Charlie either way. 

I was guessing that Kate and Will are not together because they're not standing beside each other (and nothing to indicate otherwise).

Some other things left open:

1. Do we know if Baker is ever confirmed as Vice President?
2. Can we assume Amy takes Santos offer to join the administration as we see her in episodes later on?
3. I guess due to timelines of the last season we never find out about Ellie and Vic's child.

	<TEXT> ...about what we're supposed to surmise based on the flash forward episode earlier that season (S7E1), which takes place at the opening of President Bartlet's library:

1. CJ and Danny: together and have a child.
2. Will Bailey and Kate Harper: Will has been elected to the Congress in Oregon, Kate just finished a book but no reference to them being together. I take it they are not.
3. Josh and Donna: Josh is at the library opening and still working for Santos. Presumably still with Donna.
4. Charlie and Zoey: Charlie has (or is about to, can't remember) graduated from law school, Zoey not mentioned. I think they might be together.
5. Toby is present but I can't recall what was said about him.

Did I miss anything?

Edit: changed reference to S7E1 to "flash forward" from "flashback" for clarity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've just watched "Election Day, Part 2" the episode where Leo dies. Bartlet reflects on their first meeting, how it was an argument about monetary role of the fed.  He also states they almost lost him 15 years ago but doesn't go into details (must have been addiction issues). So for sure he knew him for at least15 years. I don't recall the dates for when Bartlet was in office.

Also when the announcement is made about his death on television the reporter states that Leo was a vice presidential candidate, White House counsellor, Chief of Staff, labor secretary, a captain of industry as well as a decorated Vietnam war veteran. It was also stated that Leo also played a major role in shaping every presidential election in the past quarter century. So if Bartlet was heavily involved in the Democratic Party back then he may have known Leo for at least 25 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I acknowledge that the phrase, "rotation in pathology" is one you would most commonly associate with a medical residency program. However, it is possible for PhD students to take classes, do practicums and audit courses in closely related fields depending on their research focus. I know someone from grad school who spent one year in medical school as it pertained to his PhD research. 

I have to admit I did start to wonder if they were retconning Delphine's education from a PhD to PhD/MD program. Some of the comments made (like above) and procedures she's performed could imply she might be a PhD/MD. I consider this logistically unlikely but if the writers want to make it so there's nothing stopping them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Regarding the episode with Leo's death does anyone recall if there were any interviews with the cast about shooting it after it aired? 

It would be interesting to hear how they dealt with their feelings. 

I'm sure many actors are holding back tears when doing scenes acknowledging the loss of a character when an actor leaves a show.  Sure they're sad because they won't be working with that person again. But at least they are still alive in real life. </TEXT>

During the First World War the Regiment raised three battalions for the Canadian Expeditionary Force, the 15th, the 92nd and the 134th. From its initial baptism of fire at the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915 to the end of the war, the Regiment was awarded a total of 21 Battle Honours.

During the Great War, the 15th Battalion, CEF, was authorized on 1 September 1914 and embarked for Britain on 26 September 1914 and arrived in France on 15 February 1915. The Battalion fought as part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division in France and Flanders throughout the war. The 15th Battalion was disbanded on 30 August 1920. The 92nd Battalion (48th Highlanders), CEF was authorized on 30 July 1915 and embarked for Britain on 20 May 1916, where the battalion provided reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field until 24 January 1917, when its personnel were absorbed by the 5th Reserve Battalion, CEF before being disbanded on 1 September 1917. The 134th Battalion was authorized on 22 December 1915 and embarked for Britain on 8 August 1916, where it provided reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field until 7 March 1918, when its personnel were absorbed by the 12th Reserve Battalion, CEF. The battalion was then disbanded on 29 November 1918

	<TEXT> Yes, I've thought that as well. The pairing seemed odd. I like both characters on their own but together not so much. However, one of the scenes in which we are first introduced to their budding romance did introduce me to Dave Brubeck's "Take Five" for which I'm eternally grateful.

I'm sure Josh Malina will provide us with some insight into this in his podcast. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two things bug me the most: in real life the physicians are no where near that involved with the patients or their lives. At best they speak with them for a minute or so. The nurses have way more interaction with patients and their families. 

The other thing is the number of scenes in which physicians are reading film. How many times are scenes set up where the main cast are getting consults while viewing film? It's the radiologist that reads film. None of the main characters are radiologists. Also they are always there when the patient is having a CT or MR. That's a technician's job. Also virtually no hospitals use view boxes anymore. </TEXT>
