	<TEXT> He gives you a prescribtion, but with that you go to a pharmacy (Apotheke in German) and if it's something not so common they'll order it for you. Depending on when you are there you get the meds on the same day or the next day. Then also depending on what has been prescribed and what insurance status you have, you may have to pay part of the meds. E.g. I had to pay 5 for a 40 package of meds, if you are a child you'll get most of the stuff free.

Then there is also the possibility, that if you have a chronic disease you only have to pay a certain amount each year and everything above that you can get back. All in all we have pretty complicated system I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have read that in other countries you can pick up Ibu and/or Aspirin in the super market. In Germany a pharmacy is completely different. You have to go through an apprenticeship before you can open one yourself.

Also in Germany you don't get the meds from your doctor, in fact as far as I know the docs are not allowed to give you any meds except they deem that you need them for you imediate care and then they are only allowed to give you one dosis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm from Germany and here we have a few different pharma companies selling the same stuff for basicly the same price. But here it's a bit harder to get ibuprofen, because you have to go to a pharmacy or depending on the dosage a doctor has to prescribe you it.

Also I just wanted to point out that there is theoretically the possibility to get it from another company than Bayer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you say, the guy was an asshole, because he is German or he is German because he is an asshole? Please enlighten me.

But have you considered that he was an asshole, because he is an asshole and that neither the gender nor nationality has to do with that?

You know what? All Germans I know would've done it themselfes, because it's more efficent and Germans are very efficent most of the time. He was just a dick and nothing more. The nationality has nothing to do with that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of late but still I want to share my story.

The place is a public train in the area around Dortmund Germany. I'm on my way back from university so it's afternoonish. On the first stop after I got onto the train a group of 6 Neo-Nazis entered the train. How did I know they were Neo-Nazis? Well they wore T-Shirts with the logo of an lately forbidden Neo-Nazi group. They are quite and they don't say anything about the people who look like they were not German.

However two stops after that a group of maybe 10 (not sure didn't really count them) Punks enteres the train trough a door where they can instantly spot the Nazis. Yup, shit was about to get down in the train.
It took maybe 3 minutes and both groups were insulting each other and pulling out weaponish items (brass knuckels and stuff that helps you when you punch someone to really hurt them). And then hell brooke loose, I don't know who threw the first punch, but there they were 16 grown ass men beating each other up in a train.

We, as in I and a few other passenger, inform the train personal about what is happening and where and stuff, so the next stop a huge group of policemen, maybe 30 or even more, enter the train and use pepper spray and stuff to separate the two groups. Everybody had to leave the train and give the personal informations to the police in case the officers did want informations from you. Also the interior of the train is full of pepper spray, so we are told that a bus will come soon to pick us up and bring us to our stops.

If I remember correctly 3 of the Nazis were arrested and 6 of the Punks. I don't know what and if there were any charges pressed against theese people. I had to wait like 20mins for the bus, which was 10mins longer than it would've taken the train on a normal day. So I was late and did miss my connection, so I had to wait again.

Ohter than that I have to say my experience with public transport has been very good and I basicly use it for maybe 10-12 years now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Afaik the word curry is used for many different dishes mostly from South Asia. The term is based on the Tamil word "kari" which means "sauce". "kari" is understood to mean vegetables and/or meat cooked with with/without gravy. So a "curry" is basicly everything with a complex mixture of spices.

At least that is what I heard and read on several occasions regarding curries as dishes and their variants and stuff like that. However I'm not from South Asia so take it with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But in the U.S. the payment of waiters is done diffently than in Germany I think. As far as I know in the U.S. most waiters are paid a very low amount and the tips are calculated into the wage itself and if not a certian amount is met the employer has to pay the rest for minimum wage. So if one knows that you are somewhat "forced" into tipping, because otherwise the waiter may not make enough money this month.

However in Germany the tip is not part of the wage and is completley tax free. In Germany there is not even an assumed entitlement, because the person may not have enough money to live without it. Heck I think if that were the case tips wouldn't be tax free anymore. So no guiltripping or anything. A tip in Germany is because you thought the service was good and if you don't want to tip don't do it without feeling guilty.

Also I hear sometimes that restaurants in the U.S. put a tipping fee onto the receipt, that the guest has to pay. I don't know any case here in Germany, but that does not mean there are none, but in general restaurants don't do it, because then tax has to be paid for it. So it would mean less for the waiter and eventuelly more costs for the employer, because the waiter gets into another tax group and stuff like that.

	<TEXT> What is so peculiar about it?

If you are in a restaurant you can go 5% to 10% or the order. If you have a very high priced order you can give 5%. But it's up to. You can give 10% or more on every order or you can even not give any tip, if you didn't like the service. If you take a taxi 10% tip is always good. However here you can also give nothing.

Keep in mind in Germany you are not entitled to tip if you didn't like the service you recieved. Also in most jobs the tip is not considered part of the payment. </TEXT>

Beispielsweise wenn man neu bei einem Verein ist, wird man wahrscheinlich die Vereinsmitglieder duzen (zumindest ist dies meine bisherige Erfahrung), wenn man hingegen in eine neue Firma kommt, wird man wohl die hher gestellten Siezen (wobei dies auch immer weniger wird und immer mehr Chefs dazu bergehen ein generelles Du in die Firma einzufhren).

Ein Internerforum (was Reddit ist, wenn man es mal ganz weit runterbricht) ist eher wie ein Verein und weniger wie eine Firma, dementsprechend gehen die meisten Mitglieder davon aus, dass das Du genutzt wird. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Germany you **have** to have a health insurance. There are general health insurance companies and private ones. The private ones don't have to take you if they don't want to, but as far as I know the general ones can't deny you. Normally when you work or get unemployed money part of the money goes towards your health care. If you are employed, part of that is payed by your employer, the rest is payed from your pay check, but you don't have to take care of it, the employer normally just deductes the money.

The therapist has to fill out an form and send it to your insurance company and they'll pay for it. As far as I know they grant a specific number of appointments and if your therapist thinks you are still in need of treatment they can send in another form to get more appointments.

However that is only true if you have a diagnosis and letter of refferal by your GP. As far as I understand and know it, not matter what therapy your GP has to give you a letter of refferal. The thing is however, you can choose whoever your GP is. You are not bound to someone.

Take my word with a grain of salt however, but if you are intereseted, I can ask my dad, he works for a company supplying docs with software and thus he knows a shit ton about it.

EDIT: The whole system works in a way that most people are paying more in than they cost, so that people who can't pay much in because they have a chronic disease hindering them to get a job still get their treatments payed. So long it works actually pretty good and the insurance companies make big money with it, however they are only allowed to keep part of it. Because of this I got 150 back from them this year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey,

there. I recently started my therapy, so I can't tell you if it works in the long run and since I'm from Germany and we have some kind of general healthcare I can't say anything about the costs. However what I can say is, that in the short amount of time I'm in therapy now, with one appointment a week I think it may be able to help me.

From what I see the therapist won't say magical some magical words to you and you'll be fine. You'll have to work for it. The therapist won't do the work for you. He (or she) will be there to help you find the reasons and to help you find the solutions. However you have to do the work. You (as in the therapist and you) may decide to try some kind of anti drepressant, but even that is just a help, the main load of work is still yours to do.

I would say, that if you want to be helped, that therapy most likely will be helpful, but if you are in a mindset, that you can't be helped, well than even the best therapist can't do much.

I would suggest that you at least try it. Here you have up to 5 appointments with the therapist where you don't acutally have to decide that you take them. Kind of to getting to know them. I would assume something like that is also possible where you are from. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly I don't think that the right-wing parties are that big of a problem. Often they are made bigger and badder by the media and the left-wing parties. Don't get me wrong I don't support them, but I also think that for a healthy political landscape right-wing parties are needed.

In the past the CDU/CSU fullfilled this role, but nowadays they are more or less between left and right. There are many people who are right-winged but who don't hate immigrants or other religions, but there are no real parties for them.

But yeah the disenchantment with politics and the demographical change are huge problems and to be honest the later will bite in our ass if we can't find a solution that suits the old and the young. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay upfront I want to say I'm not (yet) diagnosed with depression, however lately I started therapy, because I'm anorexic and I have a few physical problems because of me not eating. For the last years I always kind of had the suspicion that I may have a depression, but I never acted out of it.

So I started the therapy and in the last session my therapist asked me if it may be possible that the annorexia is only a symptom of another problem I have. That I may have depression that is causing me not to eat.

She gave me a test I have to make until the next session. Since I'm always very eager to get the stuff done she wants me to done the first hours after a session I completed it right away. Now I'm sitting here and looking at what I have chosen as my answers and for my eye it looks like I may score pretty high on the depression scala (the test is based on DSM-IV).

This kind of scares me. She already told me that there is the possibility that she may prescribe me with anti depressants, which scares me even more. I know that if I have depression that these meds may help me, however one often hears and reads about stories where the person taking them is not the same anymore and I don't want to change because of something like that.

I have not told anybody in my direct surroundings about the therapy, they know I have appointments but do not know what. So I fear they may notice a change in me and may start asking questions. It's not that I don't want to tell them it's more that I want to pick the time when I tell them.

Heck I don't even really know why I write this. I just want anybody to know that I have this fear in me. That I'm scared. Thanks for reading however. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think so. I think either he was hinting at what would happen or he was just not paying attetion at his phrasing. He was the first person to use word "wall" in regard of the border between West and East Berlin. However no one knows for sure why he used that phrasing.

The wall was built to prevent people from "fleeing" East Germany through Berlin. The people fleeing were for the most part highly educated and/or the elite. So sure it was a tool for it, just like the whole DDR and in that regard also the BRD were tools for the bigger forces Russia and USA.

Let's be honest here neither West nor East Germany would've stand a chance if the other big player decided to go to war. They were a buffer for the rest of the two pacts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dear N.,

you know how many times I saw you online on Facebook and wanted to write you? I want to tell you that I finally got an therapist, that things are starting to get up, that for the first time in my life found doctors that I trust so much, that I told them the complete and honest truth. But I won't tell you, because I know it won't really matter to you. We were only for a short time, normally to short to have any real impact on each others life, but you had a huge impact for me.

When I was with you I didn't feel the pain and I could be me. I never felt the need to hide behind a mask and believe me when I said the three words I meant them. For the first time in my life, when I told them to someone outside of my family I meant them. I loved and still love you. Shit I'm 23 and I claim that you were my first love.

Sure I was with other girls before, but that wasn't love, that was something different. Don't get me wrong, I liked the girls back then and thought it was love, but in hinsight it wasn't. What I felt when I saw you,  that was love.

It's hard for me. Even through I think things are getting better I would love to have you here by my side to share this with. I want you to be the first person I tell about the progress I make, because even through you ended us, I still do it because I know you would want me to do it.

We said we would stay friends, but I can't really be a friend to you. The first time I saw you again I either wanted to take you in my arms and hold you there or kiss constantly. I don't really know if you or any of your friends noticed, but I nearly peeled the skin from one of my fingers because I was nervous. You weren't cold, but also not really warm. If every time we'll see us will be like that, I can't do it, but I won't tell you because if I did, I would loose you completely.

You asked me several times when I will play with you again and I always made some kind of excuse, because eventhrough I want to play with you, after all this is how we got to know each other. We played together after we met online and then we met in real life and I fell for you. I believe you fell also a little bit for me, but not as much as I did for you.

You know what my therapist asked me when I told her about you? She asked me if you were the one. That made me laugh, because that is the question I'm asking myself all the time. But than again I don't believe in the one, so how could you be the one. I just hope for myself that I'll find someone like you again. Someone I trust from the beginning, someone I don't play a role for, someone where I can be myself. And I hope it won't take to long, because I don't know if I can keep up with my masqurade much longer.

I'm falling apart and all I want you to know this, that I'm trying to hold it together, because you said so to me. When I was crying, because you couldn't see a future for us, when I kept my promise, that I'll tell you when I'm starting to thinking self destructive thoughts again, you told me not to give up. I won't give up now, but as I sad back then, I can't promise you to not give up in the future.

Heck I don't even know if all what I wrote made any sense, but I want you to know it all. Most of all I want you to know that I love you and that I wish that there still would be a "we". </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So here is the deal at the end of this month my contract is terminated, I had been noticed mid January and have to work till the 31.3, but since it already are nearly two months all of the projects I worked on are either completed or I have given them over to a co-worker.

My current task was just given to me to occupy my time while I'm at work. In general my still bosses treat me kind of shit one of them more of less ignores me, even when I greet him, and the other gave me the mundane tasks I now do. Most of the time when I'm at work, like right now, I'm just listening to music and surfing the web to make the time pass.

If I would stay at home, I would get a payed sick leave. All I had to do for it is go to my doctor and tell him about a few things going on in my life. They are not relevant so I won't get into details, but I know without a doubt that I would be able to get a sick leave for way longer than 3 weeks if I wanted, but normally I don't want to.

Right now I'm not sure if I should take the sick leave and use the free time to apply for more new jobs and well have a bit of free time or if I should keep on going to work even through I don't want to and I don't really have anything to do.

The thing is I don't want to let my co-workers hanging because most of them are nice dudes and I would hate it to have to see something like that in their position.

So any ideas or new insights? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ja, jag lr svenska. :) Ich kann schon viel auf Schwedisch verstehen, aber selber reden bzw. schreiben ist noch nicht so gut. Es liegt aber eher daran, dass ich meine Lektionen etwas schleifen lasse.

Schwedisch ist nicht schwer, es hat zwar ein paar Stolpersteine (dieser verdammte Plural), aber es ist doch schon relativ hnlich zum Deutschen, im Gegensatz zu bspw. Franzsisch oder auch Englisch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dein Deutsch ist auf keinen Fall schlecht, zu mindest nicht das, was ich bisher davon gelesen habe. Die Methode mit Serien, Filmen, Bchern etc. habe ich fr mein English genutzt um es zu verbessern und ich bin der festen berzeugung, dass es sehr gut funktioniert. Natrlich muss man vorher ein Grundverstndnis fr die Sprache entwickeln, dass man durch Kurse oder so kriegt, aber einem gewissen Punkt hilft nur das Benutzen der Sprache.

Ich lerne zur Zeit selber eine Fremdsprache (Schwedisch) und auch wenn ich da noch am Anfang bin, so wei ich doch, wie schwer es teilweise ist manche Dinge in einer Sprache zu verstehen, wenn man niemanden hat, der sie tglich benutzt und den man fragen kann. Auerdem finde ich ist Deutsch eine schne Sprache, die im Internet leider oft falsch dargestellt wird.

Die Fehler, die ich jetzt beim Lesen des Textes gesehen habe, waren alles nur kleine Satzzeichenfehler oder hnliches, also nichts was in einer informalen Konversation im Internet wichtig ist. </TEXT>

A friend of my family is a bus driver (and teaches others to drive busses) and when I asked him he said something like: As a bus driver you always know how long your bus is, but not only that you always know how long the space is you need to get to a full stop from your current speed with out breaking so hard that it may bother the people on board. So there is a reason why one shouldn't talk to the driver as when he is driving. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A big fucking no. Why?

Because I would loose the people I love and this would repeat itself until I either decide to kill myself or I stop giving a damn about anyone. Beside that the officals (e.g. government) know that I'm alive currently so at somepoint they would see that I'm alive now for 1000 years or something like that.

I'm not afraid of the death, because for all I know for myself I'll be alive all the time. I will never know that I'm dead, so why should I care? Death is not a punishment, but a relieve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The second sentence is a bit strange, but I assume you want to say, that normally people don't understand why your sentences not always make sense. If so you could write something like:

 Ich glaube normalerweise kann man nicht verstehen, warum meine Stze manchmal keinen Sinn ergeben.

or

 Ich glaube normalerweise versteht man nicht, warum meine Stze nicht sinnvoll sind.

Also in the last sentence you are using contradicting words: "schon" and "nur" in this context can't go together. "schon" means in this context, that it's a fairly long period of time. It's best translated to "already".

 Ich studiere Deutsch schon fr 2 Jahren

The "nur" means that it's rather short. It's best translated to "only" in the context given. In the example it would be kind of an excuse for errors, because you only study it for a short period of time.

 Ich studiere Deutsch nur fr 2 Jahren

If you meant "nun" instead of "nur", which indicates a point in time which is right now, than the structure of your sentence is a bit off, but I think that's quite common, because I had similar problems when I learned English and I think I still make errors in that regard. However in that case the sentence should be like this

 Ich studiere Deutsch nun schon fr 2 Jahren

But even now the sentence is not 100% correct. In English you can use "for" in a temporal manner, that's not the same for the German "fr", in the temporal manner we use "seit", which also means "since". So the complete sentence would be

 Ich studiere Deutsch nun schon seit 2 Jahren

If you have questions you can just ask me, but best send me PN then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Regarding the family:

I kind of have been in the situation the family was in. I wasn't dressed for the restaurant we went to, because I didn't know that we would go to a restaurant at all and didn't dress accordingly. That was in my emoish/rebel phase, so my Jeans was ripped and in general I didn't look like a person going into said restaurant. However partly because I knew that I didn't look like it I made my point that I gave a really good tip. I don't remember the exact figures but it was close to 40% of the bill I gave extra in tip.

To the last two stories I just have a question, because I don't work in this industry but I still like to read these posts to see where I could make the life of my severs better, I don't know what GM stands for. Is it kind of the shift manager? </TEXT>

When you like it go ahead, but from what I've experienced in my nearly 24 years in Germany is that most Germans don't like to wear something with a national symbol on it.

Hallo liebe Deutsch Lernenden,

ich biete euch meine Hilfe an, wenn ihr Deutsch sprechen wollt, da ich wei wie schwer es ist eine Sprache zu lernen, die man selten bis gar nicht spricht. Ich bin geboren und aufgewachsen in Deutschland und beherrsche die Sprache zumindest so gut wie jeder Muttersprachler.

Ich helfe gerne die Regeln der Deutschen Sprache zu verstehen, aber auch einfache Gesprche sind mir willkommen. Ihr msst nur den Kontakt zu mir aufnehmen und ich verspreche, dass ich antworten werde. Zu Beachten gibt es allerdings noch, dass ich whrend der Nacht in Deutschland nicht immer Antworten kann, da ich auch etwas Schlaf brauche.

Hello dear German learners,

I offer to help you with speaking German, because I know how hard it is to learn a language, which one does not speak very often. I was born and raised in Germany and so I speak German as good as anyone speaks his own mother language.

I'll help you understanding the rules for the German language, but I also will just talk to you in German. You just have to contact me and I promise I'll answer. Keep in mind though that I'm not always able to answer right away during the German nighttime, because I have to get at least a bit of sleep. </TEXT>

It felt and feels for me like you are the one. Never have I trusted someone in such a short time, never wanted I to be **me** and nobody else, never before have I felt so save when I opened myself up. I wanted you to be the mother of my children, I wanted you to be the person I come home to after a day of work, I wanted you to be accepted by my friends and family.

Most of all I wanted you and I to be that kind of couple that people talk about, when they say how they want their relationships to be. I wanted us to be more than just lovers, I wanted us to be best friends, to be each others constant in life.

I would not only let you in. I would embrace you with open arms., I would take care of your wounds. I would show you that my feelings for you are and were true. So please reach out again, I'm waiting for it.

	<TEXT> **tl;dr Witnessed a girl collapsing, helped her and stopped the bus**

This happened a few years back. I was 17 and on my way to my school. It was not a only school bus, but a normal line bus, but at that time of the day only students where on board. It was pretty packed, so the air was not so great at all. Anyhow I board the bus fairly early so I have a seat and because it's roughly a 30min drive I'm always kind of watching all the people on the bus.

As I'm sitting there watching I witness a girl just plainly collapse. Out of nowhere she just falls. The kids around her are thinking it's something like a joke, but not me. I just had my first aid training for your drivers license (you need that in Germany) and thus I was a bit more open for stuff like that. So I get up and make my way towards the girl. She is on the ground, still breathing, but I can see that something isn't right. So I ask a few people around me to make a bit of space and inform the driver about this. Then I proceed to use my fresh first aid knowledge and help the girl as best as I can. The bus stopped at one stop and the driver let us know that we had to wait for the ambulance before we could continue. After a short while the ambulance arrives and the girl is brought into a hospital. Dunno what it was or what happened to her afterwards but I was late for school but got a story to tell.

---

**tl;dr Was in a train that nearly derailed because of drunken football (soccer) fans**
This happened when I was studying in Dortmund. It was ~16:00 (4pm) and quite famous football club Borussia Dortmund had a match at home. I didn't know that until I got to the main station, which was filled with many and more mostly drunken football fans. The problem for me was, that my train would stop at the stadium and so many of the fans would take it. Okay it was not really a problem, because they were friendly and all, but lot.

The train started his journey but it didn't drive far. As soon as the fans felt the motion they started to sway and rather soon the train was swaying with them. At that point the train conductor just hit the breaks to complete stop and calmly said via the com system that he won't continue to drive as long as the people kept doing that, because the possibility of the train derailing. Still the football fans tried it a few times and every fucking time the train would stop to a complete halt. </TEXT>

as the title suggest I want to build a PC mainly used for gaming. The games I will most likely play are Dota2, Civ V, Minecraft and a few other older games. I compiled this list of components, but nothing is written in stone yet. The only thing I don't really like AMD/ATI products, because I had a few bad experiences in the past with them, but if there is a config which gives me roughly the same performance for way less money I'll rethink that.

 Honestly, I think if you still have feelings for your ex

I'm not sure. That's also a reason why I want to see her. There are moments when I think about her, but I also still sometimes think about exes from a few years back.

I talked to my ex now and she said she would be glad if I came. So I'll go myself and not give the ticket away. We'll meet up near the concert, because they are coming from a different direction, so I still have the option to chicken out.

Thanks for your opinion anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know any of these pages. It's the first time I think about selling a ticket I have. I'm not sure. I know for sure, that I would like to see her again for many reasons.

Your second option I think is the best, I'll ask her what she thinks about it. When we broke up I asked her if she has anybody who may want the ticket (for free), she said no.

Thanks for your thoughts though sometimes. It helped to see a bit clearer :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's exactly what I'm thinking and fearing right now. If I go to the concert it may be just to see her, if I don't go and can't get rid of the tickets it's wasted money.

The band is not bad and normally I like seeing bands I'm not that into live, because oftentimes I liked their concerts and started to liking them more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a fan of the band but I still like to hear them sometimes.

stubhub is no option, because as far as I see they are US-based, however this is in Germany Craiglist is also not so big here as far as I know. Also the band is not really mainstream, but in the genre they play pretty big and well known. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The situation is that my ex and I planned to go to this concert together, but before it happened we broke up. We agreed to try to be friends, however I don't know if I could really pull this off when I go to the concert with her. I still have feelings for her, not the same as before, but I'm not sure if that's not only because I haven't seen her in nearly a month, so I fear the moment when I see her again.

I tried to sell the ticket or just give it away to friends of mine who are more into the band than I, but to no avail. But I don't want to go alone either, because the band is not one of my favorites, even through I kind of like their music.

So I'm sitting here asking myself if I should contact my ex and ask her if and how we could go to the concert together or if I should just ditch it.

P.S. Also two of her best friends will be there also. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think if we have reached the point where we have teams that work on something these teams should choose a leader, but I don't think anything should be done top down.

	<TEXT> I think that's not the approach we want here. We are a community and open not a company, so the mods should **not** assign anybody to anything. If someone chooses to work in a project it's his decision to do so.

However this dividing into groups depending on what one can contribute or think can contribute is good. For that we could use the user flair. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there I'm zeamiennosuke,

I think the most I'm able to contribute in regards of programming, since that's my current job anyhow.

The languages I currently am able to program in are:

* C#
* Java
* Javascript
* CLISP

But I learn fast so I don't think thats a problem ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are many ways to help us. We are just at the beginning and I think it'll be a while until we start developing. You can bring in ideas how the game should be at this stage.

Later you can test the game or help new users or or. Just because a game includes programming does not mean that you have to be a programmer to help.

If you want to learn it you can later look into the code and try to understand how and why something was done that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay that is quite inaccurate. I see what you are saying/want to say, but saying that XML isn't a real language is not right. If you said isn't a real programming language then you are right, but XML is still a language.

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a, as the name suggest, Markup Language. Same goes for HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML and XML are quite similar, because they are, as far as I know, based on SGML. If I recall correctly HTML is based on SGMLguid an SGML based markup language used by CERN. The biggest difference is that XML is a meta-language, meaning that you can define own tags when need be, while HTML does not support that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The question is where you have your problems. German is not easy to learn and to be honest even many (if not most) Germans don't know all the rules.

I can give you a general tip and that is read, hear, speak and write as much German as possible. At least if you are interested in speaking the language and not just getting through your course. I don't know how it is with German in other countries, but the English we learn in school differs greatly from the English that is spoken on a daily basis.

But I can give you one thing that helped me a lot in regards of using das or dass. As you may know they are used for dependent clauses and are not interchangeable, but often times people use the wrong one, because they are not sure which one to use. An easy rule to determine which to use is to try to replace it with "dieses", "welches" or "jenes" it's always "das" never "dass".

If you need help just PM me and I'll try to help you the best that I can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude you should tell him. If he is so grossed out that he end the relationship it wasn't worth it anyway. As far as I know they are not that uncommon (I think something over 10% of all people in the U.S. have them). If he is not grossed out you did the best, because you were honest to him and I think it can be safely assumed that his trust in you will get bigger.

But congrats for getting from top to bottom. I'm not gay myself but I know a few and they told me, that being able to be both is the best, so now you are able to be both. </TEXT>
