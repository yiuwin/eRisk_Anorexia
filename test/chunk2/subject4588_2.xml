	<TEXT> I definitely encourage it. I never saw myself as funny, but I thought it would be a great way to step out of my shell. I figured that no matter how bad I do, I can't do worse than America right now!

As for my humor, I'm very minimal and self-deprecating. I'm going to watch some stand-up to see what humor I gravitate to, but it's going to be exciting delving into things. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIFU by forgetting my MacBook Pro at an Apple Store </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-03 05:38:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I fucked up my MacBook Pro, and took it to the Apple Store. I pull it out to show the damage (cracked screen, malfunctioning keyboard) and put it down on the table as I look at the laptop I end up buying at another table. I figured that since my apple care ran out, and the cost of fixing a 3.5 year old laptop was way too high, it would be better to buy a new one. I could also trade the old one in (value ~$500), which would be a huge dent in the price of the new one. With this in mind, I buy the new one and head back home hella excited.

I head home and I look into my backpack to pull out my old computer so I can transfer files (I have grad papers in my old computer mind you). There's nothing. I lose my shit. To add insult to injury, I try to call the Apple Store and they put me on hold for half an hour. By the time I get someone, the store has closed and my best hope is to go there first thing in the morning and hope it is still there.

The first thing that I'm typing up on this new laptop is this TIFU. Fuck this Friday, yo.

TL;DR - Take my old MacBook to get it fixed, cost is too high so I decide to buy a new one. Forgot to take the old one with me back home, which also has my grad papers/finals. </TEXT>
