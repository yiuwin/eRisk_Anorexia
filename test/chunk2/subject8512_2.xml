	<TEXT> Great plan! And thank you!
I think reddit is a quite good place to get your music in games, but you can't be passive and just post your music and hope someone will click on it, you need to approach the people posting about their new games and propose to them that they really need a composer, and they really need you! :) That has at least worked for me!
Keep it up!

	<TEXT> Haha! Don't feel dumb! I think your music is nice, and I think you really could be something! But one can never know too much music theory! Good Luck!
(I btw also have released 2 albums, but focus on orchestral scoring and I'm studying music in sweden right now, writing my first symphony. I've been involved in a few indie movies and a game, and I think that if you really want to make music for games, you really should go for it and have fun along the way! Good luck again!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've listened to some of your work! I think it's quite good! Really fitting for fighting games, just wandering, how much music theory do you know?
I think you could really benefit from reading a couple of years worth of classical and jazz harmony, just wandering what previous experiences with theory you have! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> okay, so I got something. I used an eq and swept trough the mid, mid-low frequencies and found a few "melody-like" things that I layered on top of each other and got massive chords kind of resembling the ones in the song. I'm going to continue to refine the chords and make some actual sensible sheet music out of it, but now after one and a half hours of listening, I thought I would take a break and share what I got so far! AWESOME music! Love it! Gonna listen a lot more to them later! 
[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sm21l1uhfev04yh/AACeIZMwKNpDSDJChh5C57Qla?dl=0) is a link to a picture of the insane sheet music, the MIDI data as well as a mp3 file!

EDIT: The sheet music doesn't seem right, but the midi and mp3 should be right! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would write the arpeggio as one voice and use some hideous ties when necessary :) and the write the melody as a different voice. You probably need to be quite careful about fingering, or you will have to break the legato somewhere, but that's probably not the whole world :) Gershwin cheated a lot in his "legatos" so it's ok! 

EDIT: you could use (i don't know what it's called in english) these legato-bows that show a "line" instead of just keeping the key pressed until the next note is pressed. It would look neater! (Sorry if I explain bad, I can edit this post when I get back home and provide some example photos) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, yes you could cross the staffs, but that seems unnecessary. It all depends on (if it's piano) what hand plays what and if you are going to add a melody, in which case you probably need more than one voice per staff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To make new interesting music, you often need to know the rules, so you can break them. One does definitely not need any theory to be creative and create wonderful music!
