For bouquets we did one rose for each girl, simple boutineer for each guy.  Simple and elegant.  Little things like this, and not focusing on details, made for a very smooth wedding and lots of fun planning to focus on stuff like music and fun and love! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One group that I've joined is *extremely* well monitored, that is, the leaders of the team check pretty regularly if you are active in the group.  Group requirements are 1 treasury per week and 2-4 pins or tweets.  If you're not keeping up to par, they boot you.  Since one of my shops has [generic products](http://www.oakwoodleaves.etsy.com), I promote it in groups like [this](http://www.etsy.com/teams/12618/one-woman-business-team).  The treasuries must have at least 5 other team members' products in it.  From this group, I have a decent amount of exposure and have made what I deem an "okay" amount of sales.  It definitely hasn't taken off like my other shops, but it's got a nice little stream of income. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend (now husband) would get hit on in college with me at the same bar.  Once, I tried to pull him away/dance from a girl dancing with him and she pushed me away and her between us.  I thought it was cute that she thought she could steal him, so I let her have him for a bit of the evening...only for her to find out the next day that (she was friends with my roommate! We'd just never met) was obviously never going to attain him.  I take it as a compliment that I'm married to a sexy man. ha, ha.

	<TEXT> What's up, Durango?  I'm working on my summer bucket list, and I have to say that this area is very high on the list.  I was wondering if you all had suggestions for camping in this area, sights to see, bars, etc, anything you have to contribute I would love to hear!  My apologies if there's something in the sidebar addressing camping - if there is, I have failed to find it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In regard to prep before Christmas - absolutely.  Be thinking in Sept/Oct at the very latest of what kind of stock you can have built up.  (Speaking from experience and being *swamped* in Nov/Dec and having lots of people expecting custom work out within 1-2 days.  Seriously..who orders on Dec. 22 and expects a custom painting there by Christmas?)  Anyway, I would say go for it.  Worst case scenario, you don't yield many sales and just re-run a "Not too early for Christmas!" promo in October.  Etsy groups and teams are always a great boost for your biz- I've used [this group](http://www.etsy.com/teams/12618/one-woman-business-team) a lot in the past (and currently).  How they work, is they promote each others' products through Etsy and a few other platforms.  You have to have a little dedication because they do check to see if you're posting frequently/according to schedule.  (2 pins/tweets weekly   1 treasury/week).  Naturally, there are several, several more groups and teams, I've just had the most success with this one, regardless of the season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use these to track promos from secondary sources and that's it.  I've seen a lot of headliners/announcements stating "20% off everything today!" or similar promos.  It's just my opinion and what works for me, but traffic that comes to my shop hadn't known about a discount before hand, and sacrificing a buck or two isn't going to change their mind in favor of a purchase.  **Other thoughts on this issue could lead to a great discussion!  Eager to know how others feel about it** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Make it as close as actual to possible.  Subtract the packaging costs from your bottom line.  If you charge $10 for shipping and a customer sees $8.50 on the box (even if you've spent $.80 on the box and $.70 on packing peanuts and bubble wrap and tape), they'll feel ripped off.  

(Somewhat) Unrelated, on some of my items, such as [this](http://www.etsy.com/listing/110325146/his-the-mustache-glass), I only charge $5 shipping, even though it costs $8-9.  Keep in mind that not all of your products are going to have a killer margin, variety is just an element that keeps people coming to your shop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. USPS calculates pretty accurately for you.  I use stamps.com, so I can plug in the name/addy and see how much it is.  Same platform (more/less) on [USPS.com](http://www.usps.com/).  In the past, I've just put some bogus number like $15-20 for shipping (knowing it will be around that), and in the event that someone wants to be crazy and spend that much, fine.  Recently, however, international ship rates have SKYROCKETED, so I only ship flat envelopes ($1.10 currently). </TEXT>
