	<TEXT> Studying at Teesside Uni:) I'm doing a generic game design course this first year, then the second year (This August) is where we specialise and when I'll start the games art course, so I'm hoping to improve my art skills by quite a margin before then. 

But thanks for the advice!:) I'll definitely focus more on paper than digitally (it will stop me using cheats such as perspective mode so I can actually learn it!). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm studying a games design course (1st year), I was originally placed on the foundation year but once they looked over my portfolio they moved me up to the first year! I've tried to avoid digital environments as much as possible due to the mass of detail and "fear" of perspective. I mainly stick to paper as it's much easier for me, but I'm slowly moving more towards digital art since I've purchased a cheap graphics tablet (20).

My history with art has been pretty chaotic, and I've avoided the fundamentals of drawings (I was stupid and thought it was dull and boring), which in turn has come back to haunt me. So I'm now 18 and have very little "skill". I aspire to be a concept artist (It's going to take a hell of a lot of work, and many many hours), but I hope I can eventually get there now that I'm slowly heading in the right direction </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you!! Yeah, I really need to concentrate more on the basics, this is for one of 10 final pieces I need to do for University, and it just looked to blank without photo textures...my main problem is not knowing where to start with the fundamentals as there are so many techniques and ways to approach the basics that is seems pretty overwhelming for me </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the moment I don't have any collision code for the enemies, I have unchecked "solid" on the door (object I don't want the enemies to go through) so that the player can pass through it, but I'm now looking for a way to make the enemies not pass through it (I have also posted the code for player collision in the reply above if this helps!:) ) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have tried to research, but I wasn't too sure on how to find what I was looking for. I've spent around half an hour searching for different things to find a solution but couldn't find anything

I'm using GML;
Collision for Player:
if hspeed!=0
if!place_free(x+hspeed,y)
{
    if hspeed0 move_contact_solid(0, hspeed)
    if hspeed0 move_contact_solid(180, -hspeed)
    hspeed= 0 
}

if vspeed!=0
if!place_free(x+hspeed,y+vspeed)
{
    if vspeed0 move_contact_solid(270, vspeed)
    if vspeed0 move_contact_solid(90, -vspeed)
    vspeed= 0 
}

Then I don't have any collisions set for the enemies at the moment. The only code I have for the enemy is this - mp_potential_step(Obj_Player.x, Obj_Player.y, 3, false);

And I have set the walls to "solid". 

The object I would like the player to walk through is a door, and I would not like the enemies to be able to walk through it as then the enemies flood the corridor making it nigh on impossible to play </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Meaning of "Foxboro Hot Tubs </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-21 17:02:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "The Foxboro Hottubs were a place we used to sneak booze and chicks into late at night. But most of the time it was just 'dude soup'."

Found in this summary - Kerplunk! Californian quintet Foxboro Hottubs released their debut album 'Stop Drop And Roll!!!' The album, also released on vinyl by Jingle Town Records, features the Billboard hit single 'Mother Mary'. 'Stop Drop And Roll!!!' features Foxboro Hottubs' energised hybrid of garage, rock 'n' roll and melodic punk that's reminiscent of cult bands such as the Network and Pinhead Gunpowder. The album includes the band's debut single 'Mother Mary' that hit the Top 20 of the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks amidst frenzied comparisons with a certain hugely successful rock band. Foxboro Hottubs aren't part of a redneck agenda; their adrenalised sound is equally reminsicent of classic sixties rock on the stomping 'Ruby Room', retro power-pop on 'The Pedestrian' (sample lyric: "It doesn't take a genius to be an idiot") and the furious garage rock of the title-track. Consisting of Jason White, Jason Freese, Michael Pritchard, Frank Edwin Wright III and the Reverend Strychnine Twitch, the band stated, "We are four guys who love to play music and be spontaneous. After a few late night jams and a few too many bottles of wine, we were inspired to record some rockin' eight-track recordings." the band's name is explained simply: "The Foxboro Hottubs were a place we used to sneak booze and chicks into late at night. But most of the time it was just 'dude soup'." </TEXT>
