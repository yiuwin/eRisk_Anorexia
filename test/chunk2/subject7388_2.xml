	<TEXT> I would like to see a different weapon loadout for it to be efficient as a patrol ship.

1x Smaller torpedo laucher with 4 tubes + 12 for reload (Torpedos same size as on a Vanguard Harbinger)

1x STS turret, smaller than the Idris STS

4x Heavy anti fighter turrets (like Constellation turrets)

1x Missile launcher 12 missiles + 24 for reload (Size 2 missiles)

1x Point defense system



Why?

Torpedos:
As a patrol ship it does not need to fight larger capital ships alone but the smaller torpedo laucher enables it to hunt down and kill other wounded capital ships. It can also deal a lot of damage to some other large ships like 890J or an enemy support ship like a starfarer.

STS Turret:
When the Polaris runs out of torpedos its useless against anything larger than a fighter, with just the small turrets it wont be able to deal any real damage. The STS turret would also eat enemy support ships (Starfarer, Crucible) for breakfast.

Heavy anti fighter turrets:
It needs heavy turrets to defend itself against fighters/small bombers. There are many complaints that the turrets on the Retaliator are too small and ineffective, no one wants the same mistake on a larger ship. Fewer turrets but more "boom"

Missile Launcher:
Also as a defense vs smaller bombers/fighters. 

Point defense:
A 890J "Cruise Ship" has a point defense system, but a military ship that is expected to get into fights does not ?
It needs one ! </TEXT>
