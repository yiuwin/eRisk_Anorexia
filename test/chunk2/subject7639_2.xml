	<TEXT> My experience taught me its better not to rely on land-based aircraft joining a naval battle during it. If they miss for a few hours, your own air group will get wrecked and they'll bomb you easily </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Japan has a super-heavy battleship focus which you can use to rush super-heavies. They are really good now with new patch.

Group all your ships into one fleet, build as much as SHBB's as you can and add them as well. Have aircraft carriers as well, 3 is sufficent. Only put fighters on them, they will prevent enemy carriers from doing anything and your superior SHBB's will wreck everything else. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Effective convoy hunting ? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> How do I do it ? In last MP game, I had a fleet of 300 doing convoy hunting, and they didn't seem to find anything. Also, do fleets on patrol hunt enemy convoys ? Since it has a wider spread, it has greater detection. I also wonder if surface detection affects the convoy hunting ratio. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I purge the crap out of them because I don't want a civil war and I need the %90 NU in multiplayer. No other choice. %70 is not safe, fascism has lower base which is really dangerous, you NEED the %90. (Kalinin, Collectivist Propaganda and SMERSH). Though whatever happens, keep Tukhachevsky. If it's multiplayer, you do  need Kruschev against the influnces, so go with the -75 PP at that event. And purge the Air-Navy and you're good to go. 


And why do you need the %90 ? You can fight the Germans all the way to Ural Mountains ( of course this is a multiplayer, what kind of weirdo would do a defense-in depth campaign in a singleplayer game.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Talking about multiplayer. If enemy has the ground support fully researched, there's a high chance they will stop you with air superiority, while if you have the same, there's a high chance that you will steamroll them. </TEXT>
