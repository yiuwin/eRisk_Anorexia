	<TEXT> TLDR: in Anor Londo, no death run, saved 45k souls (+ soft humanities) to reinforce Paladin Armour once I got it. 

Anyways, on the way to Snorlax and Pikachu I get invaded by someone using the DWGR. This person threw poison darts and toxic bombs and then did nothing but flip around until I died. Haven't ever played against anyone using it (or used it myself) so I have no idea how to counter it. Ended up getting invaded a second time on thr way to collecting humanity/souls and got killed in the same way. By the same guy. Any tips?

	<TEXT> From when I last checked MATH 101, either 109 being allowed as a prereq wasn't there or I carelessly missed it. Regardless of which, thank you a bunch.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All these responses have been extremely helpful and saved me quite a bit of stressing and repeatedly going over the site numerous times. Thanks a bunch, and I'll definitely try talking to the program advisor.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [For people in Toronto/the GTA area] 

I've been looking for a copy of Black 2 the past few days but the only places I can think of--Wal Mart, EB Games, Best Buy--don't have it in stock. Anybody know where I might be able to get my hands on a copy which is fairly priced (so not 60-70+ bucks)? New isn't necessary, but the game in a case would be greatly appreciated. 

(If this isn't the right place to post this, would someone mind pointing me in the right direction? :p)

	<TEXT> Can you? I've read you need both Ho-oh and Lugia in your party. 

The entire business with the bird trio, Lake Guardians, doggo legendary etc. is just really confusing haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did always like Zekrom's design more than Reshiram's.

	<TEXT> Nope, that was exactly it, thanks! 

And if I'm correct, then it doesn't matter if you get B2 or W2, right? Does it do the HGSS thing where you can get the legendary from the corresponding game later on?  </TEXT>
