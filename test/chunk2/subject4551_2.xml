	<TEXT> You need to calm down, chap. I was entirely unaware of the fact those quotes were from Wray, given that they're entirely unattributed by the Guardian. 

As for "cheating the team" out of elite competition, I guess he forced all the other AP team owners to agree with him, did he? 

edit: The article seems to paraphrase, at best, without saying what Wray actually said - given it merely says he used his notes to "comment on the dispute" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there was a reference in an article yesterday about the French only putting second division teams out next year. I'll see if i can find it. 

Edit: from the Grauniad: "The Saracens' chairman, Nigel Wray, used his programme notes to comment on the dispute over the future of the Heineken Cup, that it would be second rate without the English and French. That prospect beckons next season, with a meeting on Friday between all the unions involved in Europe, with the exception of the English.

The five remain committed to playing the Heineken Cup next season without the Premiership clubs, but France's commitment would be half-hearted, with some second division teams potentially filling their six places. The four Welsh regions will not take part, which makes it all the more strange that their union is the most gung-ho about what would effectively be a RaboDirect Cup with some forlorn French tinsel."

	<TEXT> Yep, agreed. 

As a supporter of a team which aspires to be midtable in the Prem this

"So to put it better, success or 'entertainment' has no bearing on your support of the club."

is absolutely the truth. 

Although we did finish second in the league in 1983. And cup runners up in 1984. So there's that.

	<TEXT> I agree with alot of that, but I think in a more broad sense Gove doesn't really have a basic understanding of the role of education in preparing children, ultimately, for the workforce. 

His insistence on exams and rote learning are, in my opinion, a nonsense. We live in a modern world where the single most important skills anyone can have are that of research, of being able to critically dissect a source and to be able to work with others to achieve that.

It's pretty clear that for the most part Gove doesn't have those skills and doesn't want anyone else to, either.  </TEXT>

Certainly don't think anyone particularly unusual has fronted up - god knows - Borthwick announces his retirement and Hayden Smith returns so clearly there's no one better in the second row stocks that they've seen. 

That said, investing into places like Russia   SL won't bear fruit straight away, but long term could have a real positive effect not just on Sarries being able to tap into the potential resources of those places, but also in allowing those countries to produce better teams.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just reading Anthony Beevor's book on the fall of France   the Dunkirk evacuation, and I'm curious to know whether (a) his presentation of the French soldiery as almost entirely cowardly and (b) French general staff as inept and incompetent is actually accurate. Beevor seems to present an almost entirely positive view of British gallantry whilst mentioning the odd example of the French   Belgians doing their job. This can't really be the case, can it? 

Are there any books written from the French point of view in English that are worth reading?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They tried moving it forward in Johnstone Paint Trophy games in the UK. It didn't really work because territorial possession doesn't mean quite as much in football as it does in rugby. 

The respect for the ref thing has to be bred from a young age; from youth rugby onwards you're told to go away unless you're the captain. They'd do well to introduce that in football, whilst also making sure refs crack down on dissent properly. 

I say that as someone from a working class background who played rugby. Also, i'd argue that rugby union in Wales, Ireland and the West Country of England is very much a working class game....but that's an entirely different argument.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was asked to write a piece about the greatest goal I've ever seen scored by my team. Frankly, I struggled a bit - and the one I settled on doesn't have a good quality video on youtube disappointingly - Gifton Noel-Williams volleyed winner against Sunderland in January 1999

So instead, have a selection of my other favourites   answer me this: what's the greatest goal you've ever seen?
