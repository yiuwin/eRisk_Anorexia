	<TEXT> Extremely false. Ozil played at roughly the same level all season. Giroud dropped off, he was the one who wasn't making the runs and opening himself up for passes, and when he did he wasn't finishing anything. He lost his confidence and got dropped. If it was Ozil's fault then he would have gotten less minutes, especially with a manager like Wenger who can see these things </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The signing just doesn't make much sense to me. He's 21, that's too old for a youth player in my opinion. He'll most likely go on loan this season and come back as a 22 year old, and if we do end up buying another striker then he's going to have to compete for game time not only with Giroud and whoever we bring in (if we even do buy anyone), but also Akpom, and Sanogo. I would have much rather preferred a younger striker if we're buying players for the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion the system doesn't really work out. No other league has a draft right from college, so that changes a lot of things. Most European teams have kids as young as 16 making appearances for the first team while a lot of MLS players won't play for a club until they're around 21. If the MLS is going to become a league for developing talent then we have to get rid of a draft. It makes things run a lot less smoothly and it also rewards teams for a poor season. With that in mind, I also think they should create a relegation and promotion system which would make it more competitive and interesting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want Cazorla to play further up on the left, as he's played there before. That way Alexis can move back to the right where he is more comfortable and Xhaka can thrive in the midfield along with Ramsey who can run forever  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If Batshuayi and Lacazette have a similar goal-to-appearance ratio, and Lacazette is averaging the same amount as Giroud is, then Batshuayi is averaging the same amount as Giroud is as well. And Giroud isn't exactly great but he's a good, solid striker. We can't buy anyone that is much better than him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Only scored 72" as if 72 goals is a bad thing? Also his goal to appearance ratio is almost identical to Batshuayi's so I don't see why people view Lacazette as a bad striker while putting Batshuayi on a pedestal without watching either of them play. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone has their panties in a bunch because just because Palace had a bid for Batshuayi accepted, so I guess that means that we need to buy a striker immediately or Wenger Out.  </TEXT>
