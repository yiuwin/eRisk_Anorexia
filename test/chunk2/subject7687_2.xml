I even miss him like crazy right now, poor guys sleeping. _ I just try to keep busy and tell myself all the things that I imagine in my head that I think will happen will happen soon enough, and it'll probably be even better than I ever fantasized :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My parents are crazy strict, and that's why I'm probably not gonna tell them about my guy for a while. I don't condone sneaking around behind their back (that might come with some drastic consequences if your dad finds out), but you can't just let him ruin your relationship. Especially if this is a person you really care about. 


The thing I learned is that the minute you're financially independent and you move out, is the minute you can give their ridiculous rules a fuck you and yet still maintain a good relationship with them. They probably feel responsible for whatever happens to you right now, because you're under their roof and they're unsure about the whole online thing (you can't really blame them, I mean look at all the bad press online relationships get), but that doesn't mean your father can just ruin your relationship. You need to have a serious talk with him and show him how responsible, mature you are and that you are an adult capable of making decisions based on what you know is right and wrong.

	<TEXT> Hey I have the same problem. 


I'm not used to saying "I love you" and being all mushy and affectionate all the time. If she's saying that she feels like you're being more of a friend than a boyfriend, you should definitely consider trying to be more romantic. I personally have a lot of trouble expressing my affection with words so I try to show it with my actions. 

Try doing things that make her feel like you love her and are affectionate towards her rather than just saying it.



Maybe you can watch chick flicks with her, or buy her cute little trinkets or send her a hand written letter or surprise her by ordering dinner for her one night or show her a song or picture or painting that reminded you of her or read a book with her or send her something special that she can keep to remind her of you (like a t shirt or bear) or send her a single flower, trust me it doesn't have to be a huge expensive bouquet, and if it's a single flower that you picked yourself, that's much more sweeter. 

Just do anything really that will make her feel like you're thinking about her and you're putting in the effort to see her smile, because you care about her and she's important to you.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My uncle came to visit a few weeks ago and is being a complete jerk face. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-22 01:18:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My uncle who has been living in the middle east for a while came to visit us (in the U.S.) and is staying for about a month. I really dislike generalizing about a specific culture or society, but during his entire visit he's done nothing but bully and poke fun at me. He makes me feel insignificant in everything I do. He has his physics PhD and doesn't take what I'm studying (psychology and biology major) seriously. The other day, he asked me about what I even do as a psych tutor and when I started explaining some psychological theories he laughed ironically and said "HA HA HA. PSYCHOLOGY DOESN'T HAVE THEORIES." _


I would blame it on ignorance (a lot of people don't believe psychology is a science) but he said it in a way to make what I'm doing seem inconsequential or for simple minded people. 


He's constantly berating me about everything I'm doing. It's gotten to the point that every morning, I get panicky when I have to go downstairs to eat something, because he always asks me what I'm doing today and honestly, I'm not doing much these days because it's my summer break and I like to relax after a long semester, and he'll just make me feel terrible when I tell him I'm just going to try to read and clean and do laundry and stuff. 


I don't know what his problem is, but he seems to get a kick out of making feel bad about myself. Even about small stuff. He called me lazy and messy because the other day I was wearing mismatched socks even though I was inside my room the whole day, it wasn't like I was going anywhere fancy and wearing mismatched socks :(



Even about the serious stuff. Today he was making fun of me because things with my parents are getting bad and they might get a divorce, and we're in a big financial mess and we might lose our home so he made fun of me about that by laughing and saying "HA HA HA! SOON YOU WON'T HAVE A HOME! YOU'LL BE HOMELESS!!" after I remarked that the U.S. is my home and I wouldn't wanna live anywhere else. 


The other day I even overheard him tell my father that he believes women generally have smaller brains so you have to dumb yourself down treat them like children sometimes.



Honestly, my patience is wearing thin with this man. I'm at my wits end and don't know how to deal with him. I would say that it is just an attitude that was indoctrinated into him because of the culture he was raised in, but he is actually pretty decent with my older sister and doesn't make half of the bitter or hurtful "jokes" with her. 


I try to think of it as him just trying to "joke" around with me, but most of the things he says are very hurtful and not very appropriate to joke about. I guess he doesn't realize it? How do I combat his rude remarks and cruel jokes or should I just keep ignoring it until he has to leave? Is this even worth confronting him about? If anyone has gone through something similar, any advice would be appreciated! I'm a 21 year old female just fyi.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally understand how you feel because something very similar is happening to me. It really sucks!! Especially the whole ignoring your existence on Facebook part. 


Some people might think, well it's just Facebook and it doesn't really matter because it's just some social media website, but like you said, it's a public forum where all or most of his friends and family are congregated and him not adding you on it, coupled with the fact this is a long distance relationship and you will hardly ever interact with those people will definitely make you feel like he's hiding you from that part of his world. It's not far fetched to feel like he's doing that because he's embarrassed  or ashamed, even though that might not be his intention. Something very similar is happening to me, so I know *exactly* how you feel about feeling hurt even though your rational side is telling you not to be. 


It might not seem extremely logical to people why someone would get hurt over facebook but the implications of his behavior or the assumptions that you can draw from them (i.e. he hasn't added you because he's hiding your relationship or feels embarrassed) can be extremely hurtful. I don't really have any advice on how to deal with that feeling, as I'm trying to figure out how to deal with it myself :( , but I think a long talk where you really discuss how the whole situation is paining you and asking him directly why he has her added but not you and discussing why he still hasn't told his parents (IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS!!) would make you feel a little better. Definitely communicate with him everything that you've been feeling! Even if you already talked about it, letting him know how it's making you feel still can help him realize how this is affecting you, because who knows, maybe he's just ignorant to how the whole situation is really making you feel. The worst thing you can do is keep it in and let it boil inside of you until you just lose it one day (take it from me!!).


If you need someone to talk to I'm here. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the one hand, they might just be friends and there is no romantic interest between them, but on the other hand he *did* lie to you about talking to her only on Skype. To me, that's what would set off a red flag. Not the fact that he has her added as a friend or anything (because most people have friends of the opposite sex who are just friends), but the fact that he went to the lengths of lying to you about it. It might mean there's something else going on. In my experience, when someone lies, there's always a reason behind it. Maybe he just didn't want to upset you or wanted to make you feel special by telling you that he was only friends with you from chat roulette. Or maybe there's something more going on. I can't answer that, but my best advice is to you is to be careful, because once someone is willing to lie to you about something or someone, then there is usually an ulterior motive and intentions aren't very pure. 

In a long distance relationship, what do you really have but each others' trust and loyalty (since you can't physically be there with each other), so sneakiness can undermine the whole thing. I understand how you feel like you want to read through his messages, just so you can know what's really going on, but that would be an invasion of his privacy and might jeopardize your entire relationship. You definitely should try talking to him and making sure he knows how you feel about the whole situation (especially about him lying about it), because if you keep it in you might end up resenting him and things will fall apart quickly.  


TL;DR Talk to him about it. Be careful. Try not to go through his stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh thank you so much for sharing your story!! It was definitely encouraging even though it seemed like it was difficult for you to write out. I hope one day that void goes away or gets filled. Keep your head up, and I know it's cliche, but there are many many many fish in the sea. I've had my fair share of breakups and feeling like nothing will ever fix the hopeless emptiness afterwards. I know how hard it is, but the best advice I can give you, and that I'm sure you've heard before, is you gotta push yourself to get involved with your own life. Do all the things that you maybe didn't have the time to do, or have been putting in the back burner. Find new hobbies, meet new people, exercise, read, laugh and live. You'll be able to love again. Don't let this one instance immobilize your own life! It's difficult.  I know you can do it. Almost everyone else who has loved has had to do it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uh what? I already thanked you for your insight and I'm trying to remain mindful of everyone's experiences and opinions. Just like you believe medication is the only solution, I'm going to figure out what other things I can do to help myself, without them. 


I'm not discrediting medication, but for me personally, I just don't want to be using them right now. I'm not telling anyone else to stop using them or that I have a different solution or anything. I just wanted some peoples' opinions on what helps them if they ever had a similar experience. I don't understand how this makes me interested in games?


You seem angry for no reason though...No one here is attacking you. 

I don't know about you, but I think when people post on this subreddit they're looking for positive, encouraging or supportive responses. So everyone would appreciate it if you calmed down a little. 


There's no reason to be unnecessarily rude or negative...

It really is a kind of blinding rage that can make you say/do anything. _

The thing is, the very next morning (the anger/ meanness usually happens at night and I return to my "good" self in the morning), or sometimes even seconds or minutes later, I have NO idea why or how I can even say stuff like that. Sometimes I don't even remember what I said exactly, I just remember feeling really angry. And when he tells me what I said it shocks and disgusts me so yep, totally understand the cringeworthy bit. I'm really glad I'm not the only one _


At least our boyfriends are understanding and supportive. We got that going for us!
